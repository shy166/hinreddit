fsqj68,rogthnor,Finally got around to playing Half-life 1. Here are my thoughts.,4,gaming,https://redd.it/fsqj68,1," 

  


There were a few issues, the jumping wasn’t precise enough for a lot of the platforming the game asks of you, enemies firing hitscan weapons is just no fun, and the signposting in Xen is not the clearest which led to me getting lost a lot.

Despite all that the game really holds up. Still, a solid 8-9 out of 10 and that’s comparing it against contemporary games.

I was also surprised by how much Freeman *doesn’t* feel like your typical invincible action shooter protagonists. I’d heard criticisms before playing the game that the mechanics don’t match the story. That the story is about being a scientists caught in a bad situation but the gameplay is about being Master Chief, but at least for me that criticism doesn’t hit. 

The game was never quite a survival horror game, but it got really close at times and I definitely never felt invincible.

I think the most interesting thing to me was how well the game managed to make me feel strong without feeling invincible. I felt like a scientist who was lucky enough to have access to high-tech gadgets, not a super solider like Master Chief.

There were three things that I think contributed to this.

The first was the excellent placement of ammo and health. I’m used to a more halo style regenerating help system. but Half-Life really shows how a health pack system can shine. Because the developers were able to deliberately place every health pack and shield pick up, they were able to control the flow of resources in order to constantly keep me in a state of low key tension, broken up by spikes of tension. Every big fight was either terrifying or exhilarating depending on my resources. And a big part of that was that the developers could know roughly how much resources in health, shields and ammo at any time. 

When I had resources I was always saving them for the next big fight, and when I didn’t I was scouring the halls for resources and dreading the next fight. 

The Second is that you spend a lot of time, not necessarily sneaking around, but going through alternate routes. You spend a lot of time getting places by going through pipes or vents or other weird routes, and so it creates the feeling that you are surviving so well not because you are fighting through all the enemies, but because you are smart enough, and know the area well enough. to take an optimal route.

Third, the game does a good job of justifying your equipment. The hazard suite means you are more survivable  than any the soldiers even if you don’t have their training, and because you are working with the scientists and guards you have access to a lot of equipment that they just plain wouldn't. ",1585706935.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsqj68/finally_got_around_to_playing_halflife_1_here_are/

If you'd like to check it out, it's called ""sketches"" by ""von Krogh"" on Spotify. Will be releasing more there as time goes by. As for the genre: not sure what else to name it than 'bipolar music', hehe.

Some of the songs are poorly mixed, which I'll apologize for right NOW, but still hope you'll enjoy some of it!

It came out sometime in the last 10 years and I don't remember anyone notable in the cast.  Actually it wasn't a particularly good movie, it just bugs me that I can't remember the name.

Share your top 5. Any genre will do even international movies which makes it more interesting. You could also insert early 00's movies in the international genre because some are not acknowledged enough in my opinion.

My top 5 would be:

1. ***Godfather (1972)/Godfather 2 (1974)*** because why not? Its a memorable and quite a masterpiece of a movie for everyone. Each and every point or feature in the movie deserves the praise.
2. ***Forrest Gump (1994)*** because of my early age somehow I realized that there is more to world that inspired me to get up in the morning and have a great day.
3. ***Scarface (1983)*** because it is so badass that paved me a liking for the art of film. And, it is my most pleasure to shout that iconic line in the end.
4. ***The Green Mile (1999)*** because its the movie that I cried the most. It made me realize that crying because of a movie is not silly or stupid. I realized that there are great film makers out there that can make you sympathize that much over a story which I find interesting.
5. ***Saving Private Ryan (1998)*** because I find the characters in the movie genuinely human. It somehow accumulates emotional drives at many points in the movie which I honestly think what makes us human.

Yes, I like Tom Hanks and Al Pacino. I am going to watch Schindler's List and have my thoughts about it.

Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

Basically, around 2012-2015 or so, a movie came out (wasn’t a huge blockbuster hit or anything like that) about a early 20s or so girl who was kidnapped and chained up in the middle of the woods. The kidnapper would let her out and make her do things around this camp for him, like pick up logs and nonsense and if she obeyed, she would get food and water and he would send her back in this hole at the end of the day. 
She later discovers that there’s other people there and she even communicates with a man sometime later and they try to escape but he ends up dying, I think. 

She later somehow escapes, and it shows her running away and it flashes underground to people watching (her parents or friends maybe?) hidden cameras that had been set up the entire time and that everything was completely staged as a form of a drug rehab program to scare her shitless and get her life together basically.

That’s all I remember. VERY VAGUE. but I want to find this movie again if anyone can help me out with this.",1585706205.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsqca6/help_with_a_movie_title/

9sgm4l,jkohhey,"It's almost Halloween, and the subreddits are already dressing up! Here are a few of (y)our favorite new community stylings",612,blog,https://redd.it/9sgm4l,321,"Over the past several weeks, we’ve been [talking *a lot* about community styling](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/9dx376/introducing_friday_fun_threads_todays_topic/) with redditors in r/redesign, covering every topic under the sun—from the custom images mods use to replace upvotes and downvotes to all the delightfully strange takes on [our alien mascot Snoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/9j4r5v/friday_fun_thread_wednesday_edition_what_are_your/). 

We kicked off these discussions (dubbed the “Friday Fun” series, despite the fact that it has occasionally come out on Wednesday and we’re currently celebrating it on—what else?—[a Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsmVgoXDq2w)) as a way to celebrate all the cool things mods have done with our new styling tools. 

We know we still have work to do. But since we [first opened new Reddit for business](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/891stx/starting_today_more_people_will_have_access_to/) back in April, we’ve been shipping updates [every single week](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Changelog%20%3Asnoo_hearteyes%3A%22&restrict_sr=1&sort=new)—improving accessibility, expanding flair, making desktop styles [visible on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/970xqe/community_styling_in_reddit_apps/), and most recently launching [ModMail Search](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9qr6et/search_on_new_modmail_is_here/). 

So, with the spirit of Halloween upon us, we wanted to take a brief break from our work to show off some of the brightest, raddest, identical-iest communities we’ve seen so far.

There weren’t really any “winners,” per se, since that implies someone lost, so this roundup really is a spotlight on the spectrum of awesome communities on Reddit. Because the best part of our job building styling tools is seeing how redditors use them.

We curated this showcase of communities from comments and conversations with redditors on our r/redesign Fun Friday styling posts. Each community has done something to make their identity stand out using our new styling tools, from their Snoovatar to their banner to widgets. Some communities made us giggle like awkward teenagers, some made us drop our jaws in awe, and others we couldn’t stop reloading to see their image widget. 

And now onto the showcase!

# “Twinners”

Creepy twins are a classic trope of Halloween costumes, so we thought it would be fitting to begin with the community stylings that look almost the exact same as in old Reddit (with the added benefit of being visible on mobile, too). Here are a few user-nominated subbies that look scary-similar to their classic counterparts.

# Stand-out Styling Elements

Over the course of our “Friday Fun” discussions about specific parts of community styling (like upvotes, sidebars, banners, icons, Snoos, etc.), we went in every time thinking we’d seen it all, only to be happily proven wrong by redditors who pointed out details we had never noticed in communities across the site. Here are a few user-nominated styles that showed off just how much creativity, thoughtfulness, and welding ability can go into one mod team’s styling.

**Vote Icons**

[r\/thinking](https://preview.redd.it/y7572awzg6v11.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6f5a5f05e632d3d7cf52f6bcc36893ef1e276b1)

Simple, elegant, and very, very thoughtful. 🤔

**Banner**

[r\/Superman](https://preview.redd.it/lx9lbdn3h6v11.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf380522174a1b3e8f8f4fc5ca97b740b02da1cd)

Look carefully at the background for some super-ior attention to detail (then check out the Snoo-perman icon flexing on the left).

**Flair**

[r\/NASCAR](https://preview.redd.it/37raea87h6v11.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f3f3eb2b3e7ddef5adb277351b49b3277073816)

We’ve focused [a lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/92e3v6/an_update_on_flairs/) on [improving](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/95dgnx/an_update_on_automod_for_flair_on_the_redesign/) our [flair tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9d89bh/another_update_on_user_flairs/) over the past few months, and we’re thrilled to see communities like r/NASCAR doing laps around the rest of us with how they’ve applied it. 

**Sidebar Extraordinaire**

[r\/CFB](https://preview.redd.it/n0yw7pzbh6v11.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b4d7a50448b94f56c32a9d03a9f4f13e638dae1)

If you haven’t checked out the r/CFB sidebar, get ready to have your socks, shoes, and knee-pads knocked off! This community has used just about every sidebar option available, from CSS widgets to the Related Subreddits listing, calendar, and more. A true styling championship contender, indeed.

[r\/welding](https://preview.redd.it/1nqc074gh6v11.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e6417ccc5cdc5b40a3f016628ca76945ad83c1)

Last but certainly not least, we probably had the most fun digging through all the fascinating artistic interpretations communities have made of [Snoo](https://redditblog.com/2013/06/05/whats-snoo/). While there were many inventive picks for this, one of our all-time favorite nominations was this charming entry from r/welding.

# Overall Style

And now, for the moment you’ve all been waiting for, here are a few of the best overall stylings. Most of these are communities that distinguished themselves by having a combination of styling elements, from custom Snoos and stellar headers to carefully crafted vote icons, sidebars, and a general, shall we say, Snoo ne sais quoi.

\------

**TL;DR**: We learned a lot.

&#x200B;

A month ago we released this year’s contribution to what has become an annual tradition unlike anything else on the internet: a social experiment delivered on the day of celebration for the Fools of April. It is a day we here at Reddit anticipate all year, the day circled in our ‘Cat Facts’ calendar with a big red marker. The rest of the internet has grown accustomed to using this day to deploy light-hearted tomfoolery and, admittedly, there is a brief moment where we consider the risk-free ease of producing a quick gag gift or two... but only to know what it feels like. Those thoughts quickly return to the warmth of what we know this day to truly be on Reddit; a chance to do much more. On, it is a chance to convert part of our shared space into a playground, much like the one where we first met our beloved community. On this day, there are no teachers and very few rules, just dedicated time to run free and explore and build stuff and play games and learn about each other all over again.

The games are different every time. And whether they end in triumphant glory or with little Bobby busting his lip on the monkey bars, again… we still show up to play. We play until the sun goes down, the street lights come up, and it’s time to go home and wait for the chance to do it all again. In truth, we cherish this time not just for the experiments we play, but as a time when the limitless creativity of the Reddit community teaches us things that help us better serve them during the other 364 days of the year.

On April 1, 2019... we launched **Sequence**.

# THE EXPERIMENT

Sequence was intended to see what happens when redditors are given a tool to create a collective narrative within a traditional movie format. The idea was simple in theory, to present a series of empty slots (i.e., scenes) that users could fill with gifs or text cards and then vote on which ones they thought should end up in that scene. A timer would lock the scenes in sequential order and when all of them were locked, they’d be stitched together into a single video.

# THE BUILD

**BACKEND CHALLENGES**

[u/miamiz](https://www.reddit.com/u/miamiz) **+** [u/crxpy](https://www.reddit.com/u/crxpy)

One of our main goals was to keep the site from going down, a challenge given the limited time we had. Our solution was to try and separate as much as we could from the main service. Sequence had its own voting and image upload queues, which copied a lot of what the main queues did but kept from being clogged with massive Sequence data, so image submission processing didn’t slow down across the rest of the site.

Sequence requests were also redirected to a specific set of servers that we pre-assigned just for Sequence. The challenge was figuring out how to get the top post of each scene to show up in its intended position since all posts in a scene were stored in a separate listing and fetching 50 listings to locate one post, for one scene, was unreasonable. We ended up caching the top valid posts per scene and updating them dynamically after vote batches were processed. There was also a Cron that would update it periodically in case a previous winner was deleted or removed, along with scene lock timers flexible enough to adjust on the fly.

**FRONTEND CHALLENGES**

[u/madlee](https://www.reddit.com/u/madlee) **+** [u/theandytuba](https://www.reddit.com/u/theandytuba)

One of the biggest challenges we encountered in building the frontend for Sequence was performance – each act contained up to 50 clips, as well as up to 25 more when viewing a scene for voting on or nominating new clips. That many videos playing at the same time is enough to bog down any browser, especially mobile browsers. Trying to load and play all of the video clips at once was easily enough to overwhelm a mobile browser, often leading to many clips failing to load completely. In addition to this, some clients would not autoplay video clips without an explicit user interaction, which also broke the experience entirely.

To address these issues, we built a system to prioritize loading videos within the viewport (the part of the page that is visible) first, to pause videos when they scroll outside of the viewport, and to fall back to loading .gif versions when videos failed to autoplay. The video management system also limited the number of simultaneous video downloads to help prevent the browser from getting overwhelmed and also made sure that video playback across all clips on the stage stayed synchronized to the same 5-second loop, significantly improving performance.

**DESIGN CHALLENGES**

The biggest design challenge was delivered by the nature of the medium itself. All motion-based media formats, including Video, operate on the exact same fundamental process, whereby multiple still images are displayed in sequential order through a frame **one at a time** in rapid succession to produce the illusion of motion. That illusion is dependent on the rate of those images exceeding the human eye’s ability to distinguish them individually (10-14 frames per second), and the size of the frame they are displayed in remaining constant throughout the entirety of the sequence. This constant size must restrict viewing to a single image at a time, or the illusion is broken.

With Sequence, we were tasked with building a tool intended to support collaboration, yet it would produce and rely on content that functioned by serving individual frames. **One** frame of **one** clip from **one** contributor would own the entire communal stage at any **one** time. The speed at which frames change helped a bit, but we’d still need to consider the reality of a single contributor owning the entire narrative for the period of time their clip was the sole occupant on a stage, a stage that only afforded real estate for one. The challenge was to design an interface that could display as many other clips from other contributors vying for a scene as possible while simultaneously clearly defining which clip was leading the race to occupy it so that slots surrounding it could potentially be used to build off of its contents. To define the sequential order, each scene would be placed in its desired position on a linear stage, a model used by every video-editing software product ever. However, In a collaborative environment with multiple ideas and viewpoints yelling from all directions, this linear format presented a host of additional challenges, most notably the inability to view more than one scene’s options at a time.

In the end, it was the community’s ability to organize that would negate most of the perplexing challenges we were unable to solve with design. As the great philosopher Ian Malcolm once stoically proclaimed while wearing sunglasses in an underground laboratory, **“Life……….. uh…………………….. finds a way.”**

# THE SEQUENCING

The first commit went out on **Feb 3rd**. There were 409 commits, 13,402 lines of code, and it was 45% Python, 35% JS, 10% CSS.

True to the spirit that drives these experiments, there wasn’t a unified hypothesis of what Sequence would produce. These projects are often seeded by questions we don’t really know the answer to. We ask one, try to build something that might help answer it, ship it, and watch what users do with it. So, that’s what we did here.

When the dust settled 72 hours later, 3.1 million of you came, 2.6 million of you stayed and watched, and 590,427 of you decided which of the 67,471 nominated clips would make it into the Final Cut—a hideously beautiful, 15-minute visual hodgepodge of chaos and cohesion that one critic ([u/Gnarley\_Strarwin](https://www.reddit.com/u/Gnarley_Strarwin)) hailed is “like an escalating argument between two standup comedians getting into a drunken argument eventually yelling nonsense over one another. 10/10…”

Ladies and Gentlemen, without further ado... Let us pop some corn, grab a beverage, and pull a chair up really, really close. A little bit closer. For here, presented in a glorious half-full glass of HD...

The final edit of Sequence, set to the soundtrack of *Citizen Kane:*

# THE EPILOGUE

In its wake, more creative expression emerged. Alternate acoustic variations, including one with [meticulously sourced original audio](https://youtu.be/73Ep00-KHDI), alongside higher quality Minecraft replicas and [hand-made analog sequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/sequence/comments/b8hggb/a_small_sequence_i_made_in_my_notebook/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Somewhere along the way, the sub was repurposed to be, well, none of us really understood what the purpose of the sub ultimately evolved into, but the randomness of the submissions and the velocity of activity from users, also generally confused as to why they were there but participating anyways, was really fascinating.

However, it was the process of creation itself that would produce an equally compelling story. A tragic tale of love and hate, complete with knights, snakes, killer robots, plot holes filled with plot twists, dramatic narration, a Stan Lee cameo, and an ending that hinted at promises of redemption.

When all was said and done, those that came to play had a lot of fun. Once again, the community surprised us with creative abilities that put our wildest imaginations to shame. We sat with dropped jaws watching you use creativity not only to produce content but also to navigate and solve challenges that left some of us (just me) crying alone in a corner. So, to all of those that participated, all of those that tried, and all of those that took the opportunity to remind us that [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place) was better… thank you for joining us on the playground this year.

bpvaau,reddit,Rest in Grumpiness,17871,blog,https://redd.it/bpvaau,1220,"On September 22, 2012, we were introduced to Tardar Sauce [in a post to r/pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/10bu17/meet_grumpy_cat/).

Tardar Sauce, lovingly nicknamed Grumpy Cat, was more than an icon in meme culture. Grumpy Cat was a symbol of the mild annoyance that exists in each and every one of us. As part of the Reddit community for over 6 years, she will be sorely missed. 

In true Reddit fashion, Grumpy Cat is being celebrated in a number of ways in different communities—from [r/cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/bpozxa/the_iconic_grumpy_cat_has_passed_away_today/) and [r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/bppwbz/grumpy_cat_one_of_the_foundations_to_this_current/) to [Lego fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/bpqd4q/rip_grumpy_cat_you_will_sorely_be_missed/), [Minecrafters](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bppeh6/happiness_from_minecrafts_10anniversary_sadness/), and [u/Shitty\_Watercolour](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/bpq02r/rest_in_peace_grumpy_cat/).

[Creddit: u\/Shitty\_Watercolour.](https://preview.redd.it/87cijjyyity21.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e2a0f18e26acca2050c01e7a61f8bec9de78ed0)

Grumpy Cat touched our lives and our Snoo pillows in a visit to Reddit HQ in 2015. She truly was as unimpressed by us as she seemed online. We will forever remember her sitting upon her Snoo throne, drifting off to sleep from boredom in dealing with us simple peasants.

[Grumpy Cat—of House Tardar Sauce, First of Her Name, the Unsmiling, Queen of the Memes—Sits Upon the Squishable Snoo Throne \(2015, colorized\)](https://preview.redd.it/8zngfck2jty21.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3fc39150b2ce61f19cc69f25999602027c8ea4)

The spirit of Grumpy Cat will live on inside each of our hearts. Every time a headphone is ripped from your ear. Every time you knock your head on an inanimate object. Every time someone talks over an important scene in *Game of Thrones*, someone tells you to “calm down,” or chews really loudly with their mouth open – Grumpy Cat is with you.  

So, on this morning that has already made the internet a much sadder, grumpier place to be, we pay tribute to the queen of cats and memes and cat memes. We invite all of you to do the same.  

Please feel free to post any Grumpy Cat tributes we missed in the comments.",1558119822.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/bpvaau/rest_in_grumpiness/

This feature is a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and help newer redditors discover more communities. We also announced a community contest to see which redditors could create the best Custom Feed for a variety of categories. Today, we’re here to announce the winners and ~~give them a few scraps of Silver~~ shower them in Premium.

# First, a few highlights

Since we announced the update, we’ve already seen:

* Over **300,000 custom feeds** have been created
* Over **10,000** of you have **followed another redditor’s feed**
* The **most followed feed** has a variety of “Hold My \_\_\_” subbies and was created by u/waldrich. Naturally, it’s called [**/holdmyshit**](https://www.reddit.com/user/wardrich/m/holdmyshit/)
* The **second most followed** feed is your one-stop spot for all of the NBA teams’ subreddits. It’s succinctly named [**All NBA**](https://www.reddit.com/user/8unk/m/feed_me/) and is by u/8unk.

# Now on Android

Custom Feeds are ready to go for Android! It’s part of version 3.31, which shipped on July 15th. Android redditors: you can now create and edit your Custom Feeds, plus follow your favorite feeds. (Before this update, you could only consume existing Custom Feeds.)

div2x2,mjmayank,Just Launched: Easily Share Reddit Posts Directly to your Snapchat Story!,0,blog,https://redd.it/div2x2,450,"We’re excited to announce our new integration with Snapchat, which enables Reddit iOS users to seamlessly share their favorite Reddit content with friends in the Snapchat app.

**How To Share**

Redditors who have the Snapchat app installed will be able to share their favorite Reddit posts with friends in a Snap! To share Reddit content in Snapchat, redditors simply tap the “share” icon on any post on Reddit's iOS app and select the Snapchat option. Then add it to your Story so all your friends can see it or choose a few friends to send the post to.

**The Experience For Viewers**

Snapchatters will see unique Reddit content in their Snaps and Snap Stories via a new sticker designed specifically for the integration, which includes Reddit logo and source information. If the Reddit mobile app is installed, the viewer can simply swipe up on the Snap to visit the original post in the Reddit mobile app. If the viewer does not have the Reddit app installed, they will be taken to the App Store to download Reddit on iOS upon swiping up on the Snap.

Today I picked up a book that was sitting on the shelf for the last 2 years and noticed a very small bright yellow dot on the edge of the book, I thought it was some defect of dirt but just for peace of mind I went and checked all of my books and about 6 of them have this marks and some of them have some real big ones that go inside the pages.

I’m a casual reader and don’t really know much about taking care of books (except the basic, such as keeping them dry and out of sunlight) so my question for all of you is if you know what this marks are and how to prevent them?.

Also, should I take my comicbook collection out of the same shelf or does this marks not spread to other books?

However, only after watching the movie, did I realise what a genius Stephen King is",62,books,https://redd.it/fs6xjb,115,"So I finished reading The Shining yesterday, and i really liked it. The story made my flesh creep and I was really satisfied with the ending 

My favourite parts were
1) Jack going into 217 and not finding the woman but  feeling her presence 
2) The ballroom scene where Jack meets Grady
3) The wasps stinging Danny at midnight


I then decided to watch the movie, and I have to say, very good acting by Jack Nicholson. However, IMO, the movie doesn't even come close to the book

It was then I realised the true genius of Stephen King.  The way he builds up his characters(Jack's history with his violent dad, Wendy's bitch of a mom),  his understanding of abuse and trauma, and the way he spins the story to make a hard hitting impact is truly brilliant. When I watched the movie, Jack came across as an evil bastard who was excessively selfish, but when I read the book, I really felt pity for him inspite of his violent ways. 

This was my second book by King. I read Pet Sematary a year back and that too was amazing. Right now, I have IT, Salem's Lot, Cujo and 11/22/63 lying in my bookshelf .

fsco5b,MindfulRain,Can't get into Gaiman.,240,books,https://redd.it/fsco5b,297,"I've tried. I've honestly tried. When it comes to authors, I have a three-strike rule. If I don't like the first book that I read from any given author then I will read two more to give them a second (and third) chance. I've attempted to read three books by Gaiman with pretty high hopes going into it (based on the hype surrounding him) only to find my hopes tossed from precipice and shattered on the rocks of reality far below. I don't know what it is about his style, but it just...misses with me. 

I first started reading American Gods a few years back and ended up putting it down about half-way. I couldn't make it through a quarter of Good Omens and was honestly annoyed by the second chapter (I liked the show, however), and Norse Mythology was the better of the three and the only one of which I was able to tolerate enough to make it completely through. But I don't even know if counting that last one is fair because, while he did rewrite the legends of the Norse gods, it was based off of the already thorough writings in the Poetic and Prose Eddas. His regurgitation of them didn't require too much thought or creativity.

Don't get me wrong. This isn't a dig at him as a person. From all I've heard, he seems like a really nice guy. But his writing style falls flat on its face.

His character development is bland, his world-building leaves much to be desired, the narration is dry and often repetitive, and much of the dialogue is predictable and stereotypical. 

And maybe it's just his modern style...I don't know. I come from a Brit Lit background, so maybe that's the issue. But then again, I love Anne Rice, Stephen King, Joe Hill (most of the time), and many other modern authors. Even Louis L'amour is more tolerable, and I utterly despise Westerns!

Has anyone else tried and failed to get on the Gaiman gaiety?

EDIT: I'm not saying he's a bad writer. That's not my call to make. I'm just outlining my quips with his style. I get that some people will like the things I don't and that's okay. I just feel like, while he is a talented author, the fandom around his works elevates it to an unnecessary degree.

fsndkm,innerknightmare,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a boring, lifeless book.",6,books,https://redd.it/fsndkm,47,"400 pages of pure horseshit, five days of reading wasted down the drain. The writing is full of highfalutin words and it gets boring pretty quickly. I don't know what lunatic coined this a thriller, but I had to force myself through the pages, in hopes that something would happen. But it didn't, the first 200 pages keep rambling about the perils of motherhood and how much Eva loathes being a mother. 200 pages just for that. Another 100 for introducing the family and the last 100 describing the events preceding the dreaded shooting. 

Besides being boring, the book doesn't teach or take a stance on anything, letting the reader do all the thinking. There is no plot and I've spent more time sifting through a dictionary instead of pondering the underlying causes of Kevin's degeneracy - The book simply doesn't connect with the reader on any level. The book itself is frustrating to read as you expect some sort of clash, action or resistance from the parents, but it just never happens. Nothing ever happens in this book.

There was a small twist which surprised me near the ending, which prompted me to give this book two stars instead of one.

2/5 overall.

fs7jfl,YaBoiMarcAntony,East of Eden Chapter 8 is a Masterpiece,45,books,https://redd.it/fs7jfl,5,"Now, the rest of the book is too, but chapter 8 is a special, self-contained masterpiece.

(There will be spoilers for this chapter, but none for the rest of the book. I've read the book, so go on discussing the rest of it of you'd like) 

It starts out with that strong, Steinbeck language where you can just see his classic American author face as you read it:

""I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents. Some you can see, misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies; some are born with no arms, no legs, some with three arms, some with tails or mouths in odd places. They are accidents and no one's fault, as used to be thought. Once they were considered the visible punishment for concealed sins.

And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born?""

Thusly you are eased into the chapter, and he goes on to discuss a little while longer his ideas, before he finally introduces Cathy Ames. Steinbeck manages to adroitly and beautifully create this perfect picture of innocence out of a character who is a stone's throw away from pure evil.  He weaves these descriptions of her beauty and childlike innocence in the smile with her ability to manipulate people through these expertly crafted lies or stories, and you're given this impression that she is entirely *wrong*, an abberation within the novel's world; yet, she still remains childish in my eyes - but he is not done yet.

You're given this image of a little girl who everyone recognizes some oddity in, but they can't quite place it and nonetheless adore her, and you find yourself wondering how she could be a monster as Steinbeck says - and then you get to her experience with the two boys. You read how she manipulated these two innocent children into a sexual situation, and all the while she's just waiting to pull the rug from under them, and to see her pull that rug is both awful and exhilarating. She effectively ruins or at least majorly sidetracks these two boy's lives, and for what? The mere enjoyment of it? To see if she could? Steinbeck never says.

Then there is the suicide of James Grew, something that may not even be through any act of Cathy Ames, but we're fed this one sentence:

""He was never seen with Cathy and no relationship was even suspected.""

And you know from then on that everything you read of James is all on her hands. That he comes to the Ames home and talks with her father almost feels like it was apart of her machinations, like she wanted her father to feel at fault for James's suicide, even if there is no way that could be that the case.

When she runs from home and is eventually found and punished (whipped) by her father, you'll find this cold, heart-stopping paragraph:

""Mr. Ames was frightened at the noise and hurt he was creating. He stopped. Cathy dropped back on the bed, sobbing. And if he had looked, her father would have seen that there were no tears in her eyes, but rather the muscles of her neck were tight and there were lumps just under her temples where the jaw muscle knotted. ""

Cathy was always in control, her father had and has no power over her in this punishment, he is totally at the whims of Cathy, and he doesn't and will never know.

Finally, you have the bone-chilling ending, the ending which is spoonfed to you through hints before directly given.

""She cleaned the cellar and stuffed papers all around the edges of the foundation to block the draft. When the kitchen door squeaked she oiled the hinges and then the lock rust turned too hard, and while she had the oil can out she oiled the front-door hinges too. She made it her duty to keep the lamps filled and their chimneys clean. She invented a way of dipping the chimneys in a big can of kerosene she had in the basement,""

And then she can be found at her father's work,

""She was interested not only in the tanning processes but in the business end too. Her father explained the loans, the payments, the billing, and the pay. He showed her how to open the safe and was pleased that after the first try she remembered the combination. ""

You read all this and you begin to understand what it is Cathy aims to do, but your brain rejects it, believing that she couldn't be that awful, that no one could be that awful, and then you read the final page, you read her final preparations for the fire, and you are given this closing sentence before the last section:

*Cathy walked daily toward the center of the town where the bank was. And she was so fresh and pretty that people walking turned and looked after her when she had passed. ""

She does not revel in her evil, it is clear to no one but us what she has done, she has just set in motion the events which will culminate in one of the worst acts any child could ever do, and like true evil would act, she shows absolutely no signs of it. And there you have it, her parents go up in flames and suddenly you realized that you've just come face to face with one of the greatest evils ever set to literature.

Its about population control, thought control, behavior control.

fsnki2,AnIgnorantSkeptic,Musings on the Epic of Gilgamesh,8,books,https://redd.it/fsnki2,0,"# Historical Context

Imagine being suddenly transported back in time 10 centuries. The good news is any person you encounter is likely to be a relative. You have approximately 1 billion great grandparents walking around in the year 1000 CE, which is all the more amazing since there were only about 300 million people on the planet. (Translation: you are the product of copious amounts of incest.) Of course, you’d want to chat with these grandparents. After some initial convincing (no doubt involving a quick explanation of exponential growth), I’m sure they’d want to chat with you too: pinch your cheeks, feed you, and complain about great-aunt Ælthelfreda.

Unfortunately, you can’t. Sometime before your explanation reaches the definition of the slope of a tangent line, you’ll notice the bemused look on great^(x) grandpa’s face and realize that he has no idea what you are saying. Even if you happen to be in the small part of the world where Old English is spoken around the year 1,000 CE, that language is mutually unintelligible with the language you are currently reading.

Now go back another 10 centuries (try not to think about all of your great^(xx) grandparents copulating with their cousins). You’re sometime around the year 1 AD, although nobody calls it that (even if you could understand their language). If you’re located somewhere in the Roman Empire, your nearest grandparent might call it year 754, as in “754 years from the founding of the city”. Actually, Rome might be a good place to be since the “Pax Romana” just started and it looks like your chances of being stabbed to death or raped by an enemy soldier are relatively low. Ovid’s summing up the history of the world nicely in his “Metamorphoses” and some Jewish hippie is being born in the Middle East. Incidentally, for the first time in our leisurely jaunt backwards through history, a particular city in Mesopotamia actually has a population. This city, Uruk, is old and much diminished under the Parthian empire. In a few hundred years, it will be totally abandoned. Luckily, we’re not going in that direction.

For a third time, let’s skip back 10 centuries. Romulus and Remus, mythological as they are, have not yet been suckled. There is probably a Mycenean military outpost where Athens will be and Homer, legendary or not, had not yet sung of Achilles or Odysseus. David, of giant-slaying fame, is becoming king of Israel. In Mesopotamia, the power structure is shifting, not for the first or last time. Babylonia is waning and its age-old rival in the north, Assyria, is poised to reclaim its hegemony. This will be called the ‘Neo’-Assyrian Empire to distinguish it from its two older incarnations. Uruk, at this time, is in much better shape than last (next?) we saw (will see?) it. In fact, the Neo-Assyrians are going to make Uruk a provincial capital in their empire. It is around this time, according to the most conservative estimates, that a scholar named Sîn-lēqi-unninni recompiled and updated a narrative about an ancient hero (uh…I mean ancient even for Sîn-lēqi-unninni). That hero happens to have been the king of Uruk: Gilgamesh.

We’d have to hop back in our Delorean (actually, like, twice more!) if we wanted to go all the way back to the actual, historical king Gilgamesh on whom these stories were based, but if you’re like me all this time travel stuff is starting to make you a little dizzy. So let’s rest in Sîn-lēqi-unninni’s time. We’ve travelled 3000 years back to find the first complete “Epic of Gilgamesh”. Actually, almost everything in that last sentence is wrong. It wasn’t the first. It’s still not complete. And it’s not really an “Epic”. Believe it or not, this is all part of the fun of reading it. If all of this seems like a long, arduous journey to a book discussion, that’s because it is. Form follows function. Gilgamesh took an impossibly long, arduous journey to get to us. And if half the stories about his legendary virility are true, he is almost certainly your great^(xxx) grandpa. So, really, you can look at this as a kind of “Big Fish”-style family history.

OK, OK, you get the point: this story is very old. But part of the challenge of wrapping your head around it is that it also relatively young. You see, the Gilgamesh’s story should not only be defined by all that came after it, but also by all that came before. While it’s hard to find a description of Gilgamesh that doesn’t include the word “oldest”, it’s really the culmination of a two-thousand-year literary tradition. First and foremost, there were the separate tales that were combined into the original “Old Babylonian” story (i.e. the one Sîn-lēqi-unninni was updating). These were about Gilgamesh’s many adventures, but he is only one character in a complex mythology of gods and kings.[ There were some 3,000 (!) named deities in cuneiform texts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mesopotamian_deities) There were also[ several creation myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_creation_myth), lots of religious hymns and royal praise poems, and even (my personal favorite) an[ enchanted war hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharur_(mythological_weapon)) that could talk and fly! Gilgamesh is only the most famous character in a rich mythological and literary landscape.

But that’s not the only reason the story can be considered “young”. It was also only recently discovered and translated. Gilgamesh may be much older than Achilles, but the latter has been analyzed by 150 generations of scholars, whereas Gilgamesh has been read by only about 8 since being rediscovered. Additionally, it’s still incomplete in more ways than one: only about 2/3 of it has been recovered from the original cuneiform and there are an increasing number of new editions, translations, and retellings. Somehow, the “oldest” story in the world continues to be molded today.

It is with all of this in mind that we can finally attempt to approach Gilgamesh on its own contradictory terms: impossibly old but young, simultaneously historical and legendary, singularly famous despite being just one of many, literally set in stone yet still mutable.

# The Story Itself

Gilgamesh is essentially a coming-of-age story. It begins with Gilgamesh as an impetuous youth who then grows into a devil-may-care-adventurer before finally maturing into a wise king. This character arc is impressive when contrasted with other ancient heroes. Achilles begins the Iliad as a great warrior who is angry and doomed and ends it as a great warrior who is angry and doomed. Odysseus encounters many trials in his quest to return home, but he arrives there with all the cunning determination with which he set out. Gilgamesh, for all his demi-godliness, is more relatable than that. He suffers great loss, but that does not define him. He sets out on a daring task and he fails. However, he still improves. And the mechanism by which he improves, learning to accept the inevitability of death, is something we can all do. We cannot slay Hector or outsmart the Cyclops, but we can learn to make the most of our short lives. I don’t know if Gilgamesh was written for royalty or peasantry (more on that later). What I do know is that either audience, or even an ignoramus on a distant continent 4,000 years in the future, could benefit from the lesson.

There are many other themes explored in the story: origin stories for natural phenomena, humility before the gods, and the proper duties of a king. One I find particularly interesting is the conflict between wild nature and civilized society. The wild-man Enkidu is civilized through (ahem…prolonged) sexual intercourse with a temple harlot. Aside from the obvious question for less divine lovers in the audience (HOW?!?!) there is a the more cerebral question of why? Why does having sex with a temple harlot civilize Enkidu? Is there some power from her religious office or would having relations with any woman have the same effect? Is there something “civilized” about the act itself (animals have sex too, yanno) or is it because he was allowed to have sex with a human (as opposed to a gazelle) that did it? Whatever the reason, once one is indoctrinated into the cult of civilization, the benefits are clear. Enkidu tastes bread and beer for the first time, and he doesn’t seem too sore about not being able to graze with his wild beasts anymore (another marathon love-making session might have had something to do with that too…though it must have made him sore in other ways...)

# Reverberations

Despite these internal curiosities, the most intriguing questions about Gilgamesh are meta. For one, who was the audience? Were they courtiers in Gilgamesh’s palace reverently listening to the great deeds of their lord? Or were these bawdy campfire tales with peasants guffawing at the Enkidu’s preternatural penis? Did soldiers tell the stories on long marches to kill time or did parents lull their children to sleep with the tales after long days of toil?

The so-called “experts” are not sure if the story was definitive or adapted in each telling. Perhaps fittingly, in trying to figure out if the Epic was extemporaneously riffed on like Homer’s Epics, we are riffing on it ourselves. In the end, it doesn’t matter what the Gilgamesh story “really was” like back then, because it is still being updated today. Like a 4,000 year old version of[ The Aristocrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats), it’s never really finished.

I can’t help but wonder what an ancient Sumerian would think if he could be transported to a modern reading the story. Would he collapse in riotous laughter at the absurdity of how wrongly we translated it? Or would he stare in polite bemusement[ like the Dalai Lama did when that Australian dude told him the pizza joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyuIdmA0YE)?

Can we be naïve enough to believe that he would recognize it at all? If I ever become a billionaire, I’d like to hire a team of philologists, linguists, and cryptologists (and maybe one stoner from the “ancient aliens” demographic, just for fun) who are unfamiliar with Gilgamesh. I will lock them all in a room with the[ Behistun Inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription) and all of the discovered Gilgamesh tablets and see if they come up with anything like our modern translations. To add to the fun, next door I will lock a team of the world’s most brilliant Assyriologists (in a high enough number for them all to feel a bit of peer pressure) and give them a “newly discovered” Gilgamesh tablet with a randomly generated combination of words from all other discovered tablets. Wouldn’t it be fun if they came out with a coherent story?

Reading Gilgamesh is like petting Schrödinger's cat. All of the various possibilities of the story exist simultaneously. You are in the quasi-legendary court of the historical King Gilgamesh listening to a minstrel sing of the king’s virility. You’re a scribe meticulously chiseling the friendship of Gilgamesh and Enkidu in stone two millennia later. At the same time, you’re a prince watching an actor’s portrayal of Gilgamesh slaying the “Bull of Heaven” before a ceremonial feast. Now you’re cowering behind your father’s legs as he points out the bull’s shape in the night’s sky. You’re a philosopher arguing the merits of Gilgamesh’s mundane wisdom. You’re a 19th century explorer digging up an ancient flood buried in sand. You’re a scholar in a musty museum basement deciphering a spurned goddess’ diatribe. You’re a 21st century reader mourning the brevity of Enkidu’s life-and your own.

For some, the gaps in the current narrative may be frustrating. For me, they enhance the story. Like a homing beacon to humanity transmitting a faint but steady signal from beneath the desert of Iraq, Gilgamesh has always been trying to reach us. Through an unbroken genetic chain and reverberating echoes in biblical stories, he has been calling to us. The discovery of the stone tablets has only boosted his signal. I like to think of the ellipses (…) in the translations as static noise in the radio transmission and the uncertain lines \[bracketed, in George’s translation\] as warped sounds as we turn the tuner left and then right to try to pick up the signal of the important message from our god-like ancestor:

remember….

However I have just watched for the first time the film *Lincoln (2012)* and became confused when it was apparent that the Democratic party (who I assumed were left-leaning and progressive) were not in favor of the amendment bill to abolish slavery and in fact the more conservative Republican party who were almost unanimously in favor of it. 

Have the two parties changed their position on the political spectrum since? Many thanks for any responses.",1585518556.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fre1uv/query_on_the_abolition_of_slavery_in_the_us_13th/

Why is it that the movies only show them just sitting around the fire in silence?

I guess I'm more just wondering why they sit in silence in a big room. Sometimes they whisper. But when they do, it's like everyone wants to know, and that baffles me.

Also, while we are at it. Why do people often stay at each others homes and do... nothing? Like, what does staying there in silence contribute to anything?

I am an American of partial Polish descent and I am trying to find more information about an old family member of mine who fought for the Kaiser during the Great War. All I know is that he is from the city of Posen (modern-day Poznan in Poland) and that he was gassed at the Battle of Loos (1915) and later died of his wounds in Poland during the Interwar period probably around the '30s. Which German unit did he most likely fight with? How were German WW1 units organized and were they segregated? ie if you were Polish like my family member (his name was Vincent btw) could only fight with other German poles or was this not a concern?

So.... I came to reddit for help :D. I hate to rely on people as that makes me feel absolutely shit, but I can't ask for help anywhere else and I heard reddit would be the most helpful place.

EDIT: these are the rules and what am supposed to do with the project:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BShvYeyMm\_Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BShvYeyMm_Y)

 In the mid 19th century, the United States had been through a tremendous civil war that witnessed the loss of many lives. The country was divided and fragile. However, at the turn of the century, in front of the whole world; The United States was regarded as a world's superpower. It has established itself as one by the 1900s. For this to happen, there must be real actions that had happened, events that had taken place and achievements that had been made to make the United States possess this title nowadays.  


1) From your point of view, in a chronological order, what major significant events, achievements and actions that took place during the 19th and 20th centuries that helped America become a leading world power. The video is to help you with ideas.  


2) Compare and contrast U.S. attitude towards immigration in the past and nowadays president Donald Trump's attitude with the current events, the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Support your answer with examples of political acts  


SUBMITTING:  
\- No plagiarism is accepted. Copy pasting is a zero project.  
\- Each student has to answer in a power point presentation around 6-8 slides.  
\- A chronological order of events with mentioning dates.  
\- Clear fonts and organization.  
\- pictures are to be added

frtxag,jtb587,Thomas Jefferson - The Art of Power,4,history,https://redd.it/frtxag,5,"Just finished reading this book. What is the rest of the internet's opinion of this book and Jefferson?

After reading it, mine are as follows:

1. Jefferson the man was a hypocrite regarding slavery. His words would have you think he was against slavery, and some of his early actions indicate he may have been (1784 land ordinance for example), but by the time of Washington's administration he had given up the fight against slavery. Many politicians of the time did not want to provoke the slave power at a time of fragile national unity, so Jefferson was hardly alone in his silence. However, the fact that he owned slaves makes his words on ""Equality of Man"" ring hollow to an extent. His desire for complete removal from the country of the newly emancipated slaves (his only solution to the slavery issue) was not workable either and shows that he was not able to rise above his time regarding race relations.
2. Regarding Sally Hemings, while we do not know the exact nature of their relationship, it would require a huge benefit of the doubt to say that their relationship was ""consensual"" in the modern sense of the word, especially given that she was only 14 when it began. Again, for all of his high minded talk, he was unable to rise above his time with his own actions. His actions here are pretty indefensible.
3. That being said, Jefferson the politician is harder to classify in terms of positive or negative. His feelings of slavery aside, he did beautifully articulate his thoughts on human equality with the Declaration of Independence. As Secretary of State, and later Vice President, it seems he did sincerely think that the Federalists (and Hamilton in particular) genuinely wanted to instill a British style of government and with it the system of inherited rights and privileges. Was he really mistaken here in opposing this?
4. As for his policies as president, I would judge them by their intentions and their results.
   1. For the Louisiana Purchase, he solved a potential problem of war with France over control of the Mississippi River without firing a single shot. That he did so without getting Congressional approval showed that he was not a strict adherent to his political ideals. Regarding results, they are more of a mixed bag. The territorial expansion and subsequent enlargement of America has proven to be a success but at the same time it gave fuel to expansionist motives that resulted in the near destruction of the Native American societies living there. Jefferson, in a bit of misguided benevolence, believed the Native Americans should either assimilate or move out. He didn't really do anything to prevent this outcome and likewise did nothing to prevent the spread of slavery into those territories. While he may be given a pass for not foreseeing the conflict between whites and Native Americans, he surely would have known the issue of slavery would rear its head. Whether anything could be done I suppose is a matter of debate. What would have happened if France had not sold us the land is likewise an interesting topic for speculation.
   2. His disdain for standing armies was probably an influencing factor in our initial defeats in the War of 1812. However, is such a sentiment inherently wrong? Look at the Prussians with their standing armies and what that eventually led to. This seems to be one of those situations where ideals and reality clashed where Jefferson chose ideals hoping it would work out for the best.
   3. While there can probably never be a conclusive answer, was Jefferson's devotion to states rights due to an idealistic belief in small government or as a practical means of safeguarding slavery? Based on my own reading, I believe the former but admit that he personally stood to benefit from slavery, which unfortunately makes his motives hard to discern.

As for the book, the author does not cover up Jefferson's personal failings but he does not make them the focus of the book. As for his legacy, it can't be said he was an inconsequential president and the author makes the statement that despite his personal failings he did make the country a better place than before. I am trying to decide if I agree with that.

Would Newton's theories of gravity be any less valid if it turned out he was a flat-earther who believed in reptilian overlords? In my mind there is a similar contradiction in Jefferson.

Any thoughts? Any recommended follow-up reading to see other viewpoints? Is Chernow's 'Alexander Hamilton' a good place to start?",1585585584.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/frtxag/thomas_jefferson_the_art_of_power/

I'm either utterly unobservant or this guy is a wizard of an actor. Maybe it's just that Minnesota accent and the perm... Anyway, I think it's super impressive and wanted to share.

Really great show overall for anyone who hasn't tried it out. If you like the Cohen bro's movie, you'll like this too, and Noah Hawley is probably my favorite creator/writer/showrunner in the game right now for this and Legion. Fargo is taking on more of his unique personal style as it goes, and I think he has transcended the strictures of the original film to make something special.

fspoym,SickWanderer,Be careful drawing conclusions while watching Tiger King,0,television,https://redd.it/fspoym,30,"I just finished watching Tiger King and while I enjoyed the craziness of it all, I believe the show does something quite dangerous: it erases the line between documentary, reality show and journalism. Documentaries are fiction. The film maker behind a documentary decides how to do an interview, who to interview, what questions are asked, where to put the camera, how the movie is cut etc, etc. So is really problematic when the movie goes all detective mode on Carole Baskin's missing husband. A documentary builds a narrative like any other movie. The narrative in Tiger King seems to subtly indicate that Carole killed her ex-husband. People who watched are certain that she did it. But again, documentaries are not journalism. They are not reality. Film makers are not the police. They shouldn't play detectives. So why did they? Well, to make success and make money. This made me realize how sensationalist the show is . It draws the audience using the big cats, but it makes us stay by pointing the finger and laughing at these weird people - look how weird they are! - without really showing us much about the big cats. In the end is like a exploitative, trashy reality show.",1585703760.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fspoym/be_careful_drawing_conclusions_while_watching/

fsqxhg,acarter5251,Water heater issues?,1,DIY,https://redd.it/fsqxhg,0,"
Hi, I just purchased my first home and am running into some recent issues with the water heater. The electric water heater in the house is about 1 year old and just recently the water hasn’t been heating. We had someone out to get our water softener back up and running and found out the previous tenants had removed the sediment filter (on well water) and didn’t replace so the softener was acting as a filter. Since getting the softener back up, the water has been brown with sediment but getting clearer with time.

The first time I checked the water heater, the switch at the element had been tripped, so I reset and things seemed okay. I went by the house today and the water was cold again - checked the breaker and it had been tripped. Checked the element compartments again and switch wasn’t tripped, but the lower panel insulation was slightly damp and there was a small pool of water in the bottom of the compartment. Does this seem like a leak issue, condensation, or a sediment in the tank issue, or something else?

Thanks in advance!",1585708493.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fsqxhg/water_heater_issues/

Just today I spraypainted a few parts of my headphones in satin gray but there are some rough spots here and there. I prepared the parts by sanding them first with 150 grit followed by 240 grit. Afterwords I washed it in soapy water and let it dry before spraypainting.

Here are some pictures to help me explain my problem:
https://imgur.com/a/wbDuofS

The first picture shows the finish how I would like it to be, and most of the parts are finished like that. However, the other pictures in the album show some rougher spots. 

I'd like to fix those spots and make 'em look like the first picture but I wouldn't know why those spots came out differently because the preperation was exactly the same on all the parts. 

Could you guys help me figure out what my next steps should be in fixing this?",1585682096.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fsj7g0/need_help_getting_a_nice_finish_spraypaint_on/

So the towel bar installed into our house has fallen off multiple times every single time, the plastic anchor loosened and the screw would not stay in.

So at this point I've got 2-3 questions at this point.

1. Do I need to find a stud for a plastic anchor? If not, what do I do to secure the towel bar?
2. What do I do to cover and/or remove the old anchors? I see a lot of Home Depot videos showing me what to do in the best case scenario, but I'm also trying to keep things simple as I don't  have too many of the tools I may need for this (Willing to buy some, of course).

I am Making a home gym, and we have a cardio area, and weight area. They will be about 8 feet apart, and I thought I could set up a sliding structure for the TV, since the room is long.   


My idea was creating a slider ""barn door"" style with conduit pipe and have it attach to a French cleat.   


One half of the cleat attached to the slider, and the other to the TV.   


But will the weight be distributed correctly to work? I've only seen Doors on sliders, and I'm wondering if this is even possible?

fsfqx1,fleafly,Looking to install engineered hardwood over an uneven concrete subfloor,19,DIY,https://redd.it/fsfqx1,14,"https://imgur.com/a/N8fBxwq

I'm in the process of of installing engineered hardwood flooring in my ""family room"" in the basement.  The subfloor of the basement is concrete with a decent crack down the center.  Like everything else in this house there is nothing square or level.  If you look at the pictures in the album you'll see that corner B is 2/8"" lower than corner A and corner C is 3/8"" of an inch lower than corner D.  In addition to that the C&D wall is 2"" lower than the A&B wall.  When I look at the instructions for installing the hardwood flooring it says that the subfloor should be level and you should not install it if there is a 3/16 difference over 10 feet.  Ideally I'd use self leveling concrete to level the floor but the C&D wall is 2"" lower and that's too much for doing the self leveling compound.  Would I be able to put the self leveling compound down to even out the difference from A to B but still keep the 2"" slope?  Is the subfloor just too unlevel to lay down hardwood as is?  We plan on running the hardwood boards parallel to the A&B wall so I was hoping the slope down to the C&D wall would be unimportant.  The underlayment that Lowes told us to buy is a 3mm underlayment, is there thicker underlayment that would work better?  My internet searches say that cork or foam underlayment can get as thick as 6mm.  Would that compress enough in the high spots that would work to lay down and install the floor as is?

edit: also, the room is not that big, it's supposed to be 210 inches by 130 inches, not feet.  I'm just dumb and in a hurry sometimes.",1585671225.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fsfqx1/looking_to_install_engineered_hardwood_over_an/

We had a sewerage leak/ waste water leak that started coming through the walls in our downstairs bedroom. It was running fairly heavily for about 3/4weeks before the incompetent realtor started to address it. Since then the pipe has been relined. 

The room is on a concrete slab, with timber planks drilled into the concrete (which I believe is the original finished floor). Ontop of the first timber floor, there was plywood board glued on top, then a aluminum like insulation, then a floating floorboard with the grooves/inserts. 
It seems they have raised the floor in the past because the plumbing has been a reoccurring issue. 

I've already ripped up the floor, down to the timber planks drilled into the slab. Should these come out too? (Also thinking primarily about health and safety).
The smell is atrocious and you can't be inside the room.

I'm going to be doing most of this work myself.

Does all the timber on above the slab need to be disposed? And then rebuild from the slab upwards?

Will the slab or timber need to be thoroughly sanitized?",1585707131.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fsql0s/flooring_repair_at_a_rental_vic_au/

I've only heard about it in the context of HIV and the idea is that if you reduce the viral load of a patient, they become asymptomatic. Presumably, if it increases the symptoms appear and become stronger. 

Now my question is if the current coronavirus behaves the same way. And, if so, do healthcare workers who are in contact with multiple infected people a day have a worse prognosis than someone in contact with a single infected person.

Quite a bit has changed since then so I thought people would be interested in how I've been!

FAQ

I'm 17 right now. I got my first implant when I was ten months old, and my second one when I was 15 years old. I can hear almost as well as a normal human being, but am essentially considered ""Hard of Hearing"" (dunno why the Deaf community hates that term so much).

I have a small [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsU0y8bvBBxwz2Vll6OmOcw) with a mix of gaming and spreading of Deaf awareness. Plenty of content from years past to check out (too busy with college now to keep creating).

My dad is hearing, but my mom is deaf. Since my condition is congenital, that must mean there was a recessive gene in my dad's family somehow.

DON'T. BE. SORRY. I am happy as can be with being Deaf, and I pride myself on being able to relate with others of the same condition and spreading awareness about it. That's why I made this AMA.",1585667555.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fsemdm/iama_profoundly_deaf_teenager_who_had_his_second/

> 
> More than 150 years after the end of the Civil War, scores of websites,  articles, and organizations repeat claims that anywhere between 500 and  100,000 free and enslaved African Americans fought willingly as soldiers  in the Confederate army. But as Kevin M. Levin argues in this carefully  researched book, such claims would have shocked anyone who served in  the army during the war itself. Levin explains that imprecise  contemporary accounts, poorly understood primary-source material, and  other misrepresentations helped fuel the rise of the black Confederate  myth. Moreover, Levin shows that belief in the existence of black  Confederate soldiers largely originated in the 1970s, a period that  witnessed both a significant shift in how Americans remembered the Civil  War and a rising backlash against African Americans’ gains in civil  rights and other realms.
> 
> Levin also investigates the roles that  African Americans actually performed in the Confederate army, including  personal body servants and forced laborers. He demonstrates that  regardless of the dangers these men faced in camp, on the march, and on  the battlefield, their legal status remained unchanged. Even long after  the guns fell silent, Confederate veterans and other writers remembered  these men as former slaves and not as soldiers, an important reminder  that how the war is remembered often runs counter to history.

I was raised in an orthodox, Jewish community and published my first novel in 2013. It was an instant hit, and sold well in Orthodox communities all over the world. I’m proud to say it helped raise awareness of mental health issues and normalized therapy and medication, which is highly stigmatized in that community.  


My second novel was published a few years later and by that time, I was on my way out of the community for a long list of reasons.  


I self-published my most recent novel on Amazon in 2018, when I was fully irreligious and frankly, feeling frustrated with the community I had left. I wrote about sexual abuse and sexuality and self-harm and all sorts of taboo topics, all written about a bunch of Orthodox, Jewish girls that are labeled as “troubled”.  


Ironically, I still get “fan mail” from young girls who have read my first 2 books and are obsessed with those characters. They assume I’m still the inspirational, religious woman that I seemed to be in my first two books.  


All of my books are available on Amazon, and I’m making my newest book free for the next few days (Kindle) to give folks something to read during this quarantine.

Being isolated and cut-off from everyday routines can be challenging for anyone, but it presents unique issues for those living with a mental illness, where social support systems are an integral part of maintaining wellness.

Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that can be associated with marked changes in activity and energy levels and extreme mood variation, from depression through to hypomania and mania. The condition can result in physical health problems and difficulties functioning in work, school or relationships. But, critically, with optimal treatment, care and empowerment, people with bipolar disorder can and do flourish and have good quality of life.
 
CREST.BD uses a pioneering approach in which researchers, healthcare providers, and people with bipolar disorder, work together to advance research and knowledge exchange. Everything we do - from deciding what to research, writing applications for funding, to doing the research and publishing the results, we do hand-in-hand with people with bipolar disorder. We specialize in producing digital health tools to share evidence-informed treatments and self-management strategies, such as our online quality of life assessment tool ([QoL Tool](http://bdqol.com)) and our signature [Bipolar Wellness Centre](http://bdwellness.com).

I’m Angela Anandappa, Director for the Alliance for Advanced Sanitation (a nonprofit organization working to better food safety and hygienic design in the food industry) as well as a food microbiologist for over 20 years. 

Many are having questions or doubts on how to best stay safe in regard to the coronavirus, especially in relation to the use of sanitizers and cleaning agents, as well as with how to clean and store food. 

During such a time of crisis, it is very easy to be misled by a barrage of misinformation that could be dangerous or deadly. I’ve seen many of my friends and family easily fall prey to this misinformation, especially as it pertains to household cleaning and management as well as grocery shopping. 

I’m doing this AMA to hopefully help many of you redditors by clearing up any misinformation, providing an understanding as to the practices of the food industry during this time, and to give you all a chance to ask any questions about food safety in regard to the coronavirus.

I hope that you learn something helpful during this AMA, and that you can clear up any misinformation that you may hear in regard to food safety by sharing this information with others.

I am here to answer your questions about how the COVID-19 pandemic could impact your long-term disability insurance rights. COVID-19 has created many problems for so many people who are unable to work because of the psychological and/or physical effects of this pandemic. It has also affected disabled persons’ ability to get treatments because of the closure of clinics and limited availability of doctors. Many people have questions about how to deal with their long-term disability insurance companies in Canada and I can answer them. I deal with the denial of disability claims every day, and advise people on their rights when it comes to long term disability and personal injuries.

About ‘Fodder On My Wings’:
Recorded in 1982, not long after she moved to Paris, ‘Fodder On My Wings’ was one of Nina Simone’s favorite albums yet has remained one of her most obscure. Recorded at a time when Simone was feeling rejuvenated by her surroundings and by the African musicians she met in her newly adopted France, ‘Fodder On My Wing’s is an essential Simone album. Originally recorded for a small French label and only sporadically available since its initial release, Fodder On My Wings will be reissued in a variety of formats including CD and LP, as well as widely available digitally for the first timeon April 3 via Verve/UMe

9uobsx,LastBluejay,It’s Election Day 2018 and We’ve Compiled Some Resources to Help You Vote,35522,announcements,https://redd.it/9uobsx,5441,"Redditors of all stripes spend a lot of time talking about politics, and today is the day to take those views straight to the ballot box. It’s Election Day here in the US, and we want to help make sure that all registered voters get to the polls and make their voices heard. We’ve compiled some resources here to help you cast your ballot.

**Where do I vote?**

Your polling place is based on the address at which you registered. Polling places can be looked up through your state’s elections office ([find yours here](https://www.usa.gov/election-office)). These state websites are the most complete resources for all your voting needs.

There are also numerous quick lookup tools to find your polling place, voting hours, and even information about what’s on the ballot in your area. [The Voting Information Tool](https://gttp.votinginfoproject.org/) is one of the easiest to use.

**Do I need to already be registered to vote? And how can I see if I’m registered?**

It depends on your state. Some states allow for same-day registration, so **you may still be able to vote even if you haven’t registered**. You can [check your state’s registration requirements here](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/voter-registration). In most cases you’ll also be able to check your registration status on the same page.

**What do I need to bring with me?**

Some states require you to bring identification with you to the polls and some states don’t. You can see what your state’s requirements are [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect). **If your state requires identification and you don’t have it, you may still be able to vote, so still go to the polls.** Depending on your local laws, you may be able to cast a provisional ballot, show ID later, sign a form attesting your identity, or another method. Don’t assume that you can’t vote!

**What am I going to be voting on?**

Some people are surprised to find out when they get to the polls the sheer number of offices and issues they may be voting on. Don’t be caught unprepared! You can [look up a sample ballot for your area](https://www.ballotready.org/) to find out what you’ll be voting on, so that you’re informed when you head into the voting booth. You can even print out your sample ballot and take it to the poll with you so you can keep track of how you want to vote.

**I have a disability or language barrier. Can I still vote?**

Yes! There are federal laws in place to ensure that all eligible Americans can vote. You can [learn more about your rights and the accommodations you are entitled to here.](https://www.usa.gov/election-day#item-212487)

**Someone is trying to prevent me from voting or is deliberately spreading disinformation about voting. What should I do?**

Intimidating voters, trying to influence votes through threats or coercion, or attempting to suppress voters, including through misinformation campaigns, is against the law. If you witness such behavior, report it to your local election officials ([look up their contact info here](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm)). **If you see suspected voter suppression attempts on Reddit (eg efforts to deliberately misinform people about voting so that they won’t vote, or so that their vote might not count),** [**report it to the admins here**](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/submit-request/investigations)**.**

**I have more questions about voting!**

DoSomething.org is back doing a [marathon AMA today](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9up8z2/we_are_experts_on_youth_voter_turnout_and_how/) with their experts in [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA) starting at 11am ET to answer all your additional voting questions.

cevm31,mjmayank,Update regarding user profile transparency,16898,announcements,https://redd.it/cevm31,2732,"Edit (2019/11/26): This feature has been delayed until 2020

Edit (2020/03/30): We released a feature where you will get a push notification when you get a new follower. If you have your push notifications enabled on our mobile apps, or desktop notifications enabled, you should receive one. We are working on expanding this feature to all users, even without push notifications. The follower list is still delayed until later this year.

Hi everyone,

We collect a lot of feedback from you all, and one theme we’ve heard consistently from users is that many of you want more visibility when users follow you. As we move the new profiles out of beta, we wanted to share a transparency change we are making. In the coming months, we will allow people to see which users follow them.

We know that this may be a change from existing expectations, so we want to give you time to update your settings before moving forward with this. In the immediate future (starting Aug 19th, 2019), this will only affect new follows made. In about 3 months, we will make it possible to see your full list of followers. This would include follows made while profiles were in beta.

We plan to send a PM to all affected users, but wanted to make this public post as well so that you aren’t surprised when you receive it. To be clear, the usernames will only be visible to the user who was followed. No one will be able to look up your full list of subscriptions/follows and no one else will be able to see a list of followers of a profile.

If you are someone who follows other users, please take a second to examine your subscription/follow list and make sure you are comfortable with those users being aware that you follow them. If you are someone who has followers, we will make another post when the ability to view your followers has been released. We’ll stick around in the comments for a bit if you have questions. If there are other features you’d like to see for profiles, please let us know!

Thanks!

I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**

Hi all,

It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report.

We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.

You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.

## By the numbers

Since the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I’ll call out a few stats below:

**ADMIN REMOVALS**

* In 2019, we removed **\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.
* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed
   * **222k** **pieces of content**,
   * **55.9k accounts**, and
   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).
* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.

**LEGAL REMOVALS**

* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.
* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.

**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**

* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.
   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).
   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.
   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).
* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)

## While I have your attention...

I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.

When we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.

Today, we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.

## If you’ve read this far

In addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we’re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.

**As usual, I’ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments. AMA.**

bpfyx1,SingShredCode,Introducing Custom Feeds (plus: a Community Contest with modest prizes!),8806,announcements,https://redd.it/bpfyx1,1042,"Hello hello,

We’ve made some changes to Multireddits that we’d like to share with you. Also, a fun contest! Let’s get to it...

## What’s New

*New Name: Multireddits → Custom Feeds*

Multireddits have been around a [long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/). They are a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and can help newer redditors discover more communities. However, they haven’t been widely adopted. In order to prevent confusion, we will be changing the name from Multireddits to “Custom Feeds.” Sometimes simple is better.

*More Support*

We’ve added more support to new Reddit and our iOS app for Custom Feeds. Now, redditors can create a new Custom Feed, add or remove communities from them, duplicate other redditors' feeds, and change the privacy settings. Previously, this was something you could only do from old Reddit. We’ll be adding support for Custom Feeds on Android in the near future.

[iOS Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/jox6inka4my21.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=c92d7268dbcd46b35d6d2380b8316d4471dc1aac)

*New Follow Functionality*

You can now follow another redditor’s Custom Feed (as long as it’s set to Public). This means that when you follow a feed it will appear on your list of Custom Feed subscriptions and when that redditor adds another community to the feed, you’ll see that update the next time you open the feed. This will be super useful for communities that want to keep a running feed of related communities, or for folks that have a specific ever-evolving interest that they want to share with others.

[Follow on new Reddit](https://preview.redd.it/a6ztwd2b4my21.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=4576c32bf987c0dadf6a41024134387f96b45fb4)

*Improved Sharing*

We’ve made some tweaks to the URL structure of your Custom Feed so that it’s easier to share with others. No more accidentally sharing a URL with /me/ in it that won’t work for anyone else.  We’ve also created a new privacy category for public custom feeds, Hidden, that can be accessed by anyone with the link but will not show up on your profile.

*Spaces*

You can now have spaces in the name of your Custom Feed. [Enough said.](https://media.giphy.com/media/Wyt6sLEjKjaFjzybth/giphy.gif)

*Mix and Match*

Follow a mix of communities and profiles.

*Coming Soon*

In the near future communities will be able to create Custom Feeds that are owned by the community, rather than an individual. This will also support turning the Related Communities sidebar widget into a feed. We are also going to be building ways for you to see popular and trending Custom Feeds.

## The Contest

We are investing in this feature because we believe redditors are great at finding niche communities and we want more people to discover all of the unique communities that we have. Now for the [gold](https://media.giphy.com/media/30LbRh69K3fO/giphy.gif) part! We are holding a one-week contest for the best Custom Feeds created by redditors. The winners will receive Coins and bragging rights.

To submit your Custom Feed, reply to the top-level sticky comment with a link to your Custom Feed and the category it best fits under. **It must be public.** Please only submit one feed per category.

Here are the categories that we will award winners from:

* Aww
* Artist Resources
* Beauty
* Books & Writing
* Cool Pictures (images only)
* Discussion (text only)
* Fashion
* Food & Cooking
* Health & Fitness
* Music
* Parenting
* Quirky
* Sports
* Travel
* Wholesome

We’ll be picking winners based on a combination of the number of followers the feed has, how many upvotes their comment entry has, and our internal voting. Winners will be announced in a follow-up post next week.

Here are some custom feeds to get you started (many of which are mine):

* [Some of my favorite communities](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/singshredcodesubbies/)
* Some of my [voice and singing communities](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/voices/)

This new award is available alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum from now through Nov. 2, and Reddit will match the first $15,000 of ALL Coins purchased during this time.

[**Purchase Coins today and help support children's hospitals!**](https://www.reddit.com/coins/)

Here are a few details about the limited Extra Life Award:

* The award costs 500 [Coins](https://www.reddit.com/coins/)—the same cost as the Gold award
* The recipient receives a week of [Premium](https://www.reddit.com/premium) and 100 coins—the same benefits as Gold!
* Anyone who gives this award, I'm told, has a heart of gold! (And also a shiny, new trophy at a later date!)
* Reddit will match the first $15,000 of ALL Coin purchases from now through Nov. 2.

**But why?**

Last week [we announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dmj0sb/join_us_in_supporting_extra_life_a_24hour_gaming/) our 8th year partnering with Extra Life for our favorite annual tradition: playing ~~24~~ 25 hours of video games to help raise money for sick kids. We're not doing this alone! Thanks to some truly heroic redditors, we have already raised over $40,000 of our $150,000 goal!

However, we recognize not everyone can relinquish the majority of their weekend to play video games (we totally had other plans, we swear). We made this award to make it easier for even more people to get involved and help support one of our favorite charity events.

Have the opposite problem? If your wallet is feeling thin, you can also help by signing up to fundraise! Check out [our recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dmj0sb/join_us_in_supporting_extra_life_a_24hour_gaming/) for more details about joining Team Reddit.

chdx1h,venkman01,Introducing Community Awards!,13876,announcements,https://redd.it/chdx1h,1746,"**UPDATE (9/4):** Winners of the Coins Giveaway have been [announced below in the stickied comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/eus5nc4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)! Thanks to all who participated!

Hi all,

You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently—these are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.

As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities.

# What Are Community Awards?

Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.

Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).

[A highly decorated post on r\/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!](https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=1928&format=png&auto=webp&s=735a9a37bb33c8d2139d9982cd68908c920ed19f)

In the above screenshot from [r/DunderMifflin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/), you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are **Community Awards**.

# What Are the Benefits of Community Awards?

Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**.

With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) community if you give the “Star of Excellence” Award (2,000 Coins) to another user, [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.

Mods can access the Community Bank to give…

# Mod-Exclusive Awards

Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community.

Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don’t need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price.

* Mod-Award costing **1,800 Coins** = **1 month** of Reddit Premium
* Mod-Award costing **5,400 Coins** = **3 months** of Reddit Premium
* … and so on!

Here’s what Mod-Exclusive Awards look like on posts / comments:

dbf9nj,landoflobsters,Changes to Our Policy Against Bullying and Harassment,17348,announcements,https://redd.it/dbf9nj,10369,"TL;DR is that we’re updating our harassment and bullying policy so we can be more responsive to your reports. 

Hey everyone, 

We wanted to let you know about some changes that we are making today to our [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) regarding content that [threatens, harasses, or bullies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), which you can read in full [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully). 

**Why are we doing this?**
These changes, which were many months in the making, were primarily driven by feedback we received from you all, our users, indicating to us that there was a problem with the narrowness of our previous policy. Specifically, the old policy required a behavior to be “continued” and/or “systematic” for us to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar of users fearing for their real-world safety to qualify, which we think is an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn’t clear that abuse toward both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones, were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly, it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of the letter of a rule not matching its spirit.

The changes we’re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform. 

We also hope that this change will take some of the burden off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules against-- rules that we support and encourage.

**How will these changes work in practice?**
We all know that context is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we’re talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we’re hoping today’s changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously, we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we’ll now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate some of the burden on the harassee. 

You should also know that we’ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don’t worry, machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won’t be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will still be made by a human admin. 

As with any rule change, this will take some time to fully enforce. Our [response times have improved significantly since the start of the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/becbnx/hey_rchangelog_were_rolling_out_some_new/), but we’re always striving to move faster. In the meantime, we encourage moderators to take this opportunity to examine their community rules and make sure that they are not creating an environment where bullying or harassment are tolerated or encouraged.

**What should I do if I see content that I think breaks this rule?**
As always, if you see or experience behavior that you believe is in violation of this rule, please use the report button [“This is abusive or harassing > “It’s targeted harassment”] to let us know. If you believe an entire user account or subreddit is dedicated to harassing or bullying behavior against an individual or group, we want to know that too; [report it to us here](https://www.reddit.com/report).

Thanks. As usual, we’ll hang around for a bit and answer questions.

9jf8nh,landoflobsters,Revamping the Quarantine Function,7889,announcements,https://redd.it/9jf8nh,9008,"While Reddit has had a [quarantine](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits) function for almost three years now, we have learned in the process. Today, we are updating our quarantining policy to reflect those learnings, including adding an appeals process where none existed before.  

On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit, there will sometimes be communities that, while not prohibited by the [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting. In other cases, communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes (yes we used that word) that warrant additional scrutiny, as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). In these circumstances, Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine. 

The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context.  We’ve also learned that quarantining a community may have a positive effect on the behavior of its subscribers by publicly signaling that there is a problem. This both forces subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivizes moderators to make changes.     

Quarantined communities display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content (similar to how the NSFW community warning works). Quarantined communities generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations. Other restrictions, such as limits on community styling, crossposting, the share function, etc. may also be applied. Quarantined subreddits and their subscribers are still fully obliged to abide by Reddit’s [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and remain subject to enforcement measures in cases of violation.  

Moderators will be notified via modmail if their community has been placed in quarantine. To be removed from quarantine, subreddit moderators may present an appeal [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com). The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful reform of the community. 

You can find more detailed information on the quarantine appeal and review process [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits).

This is another step in how we’re thinking about enforcement on Reddit and how we can best incentivize positive behavior.  We’ll continue to review the impact of these techniques and what’s working (or not working), so that we can assess how to continue to evolve our policies. If you have any communities you’d like to report, tell us about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/reddit.com) and we’ll review. Please note that because of the high volume of reports received we can’t individually reply to every message, but a human will review each one.

Hello again!

It’s been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I’m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). 

Speaking of bans, you’ve probably noticed that over the past few months we’ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We’ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we’re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We’ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we’ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, we’ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. 

Including but not limited to… night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven’t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.

Other than that, I can’t imagine we have much to talk about, but I’ll hang to around some questions anyway.

aq9h0k,spez,Reddit’s 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff),23458,announcements,https://redd.it/aq9h0k,8908,"Hi all,

Today we’ve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018).

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

–Steve

9ipbun,LastBluejay,It’s US National Voter Registration Day. Are You Registered?,34036,announcements,https://redd.it/9ipbun,4420,"Voting is embedded in the Reddit experience. Yet offline, 1 in 4 eligible US voters isn’t registered. Even the most civically-conscious among us can unexpectedly find our registration lapsed, especially due to the wide variation in voter registration laws across the US. For example, did you know that you have to update your voter registration if you move, even if it’s just across town? Or that you also need to update it if you’ve changed your name (say, due to a change in marital status)? Depending on your state, you may even need to re-register if you simply haven’t voted in a while, even if you’ve stayed at the same address. 

Taken together, these and other factors add up to tens of millions of Americans every election cycle who need to update their registration and might not know it. This is why we are again teaming up with [Nonprofit VOTE](https://www.nonprofitvote.org/) to celebrate [National Voter Registration Day](https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/) and help spread the word before the midterms this November.

You’ll notice a lot of activity around the site today in honor of the holiday, including amongst various communities that have decided to participate. If you see a particularly cool community effort, let us know in the comments. 

We’d also love to hear your personal stories about voting. Why is it important to you? What was your experience like the first time you voted? Are you registering to vote for the first time for this election? Join the conversation in the comments. 

Also check out the AMAs we have planned for today as well, including:

* [A bipartisan tag-team AMA with the Secretaries of State of Washington and Minnesota](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9is2zm/we_are_secretaries_of_state_steve_simon_mn_and/) in r/politics from 10am-12pm ET
* [An AMA about the weird quirks and history of American voting laws](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9iso2g/today_is_national_voter_registration_day_i_am_an/) with DoSomething.org’s Head of Campaigns in r/IAmA at 11am ET.
* You can also see the [AMA that National Voter Registration Day’s Executive Director](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9ii6uf/im_brian_miller_executive_director_of_national/) did yesterday.

Finally, be sure to take this occasion to [make sure that you are registered to vote](https://www.nonprofitvote.org/voting-in-your-state/) where you live, or update your registration as necessary. Don’t be left out on Election Day!

Today, in an effort to elevate Reddit’s diverse opinion-based content, we’re excited to introduce Polls: a brand new post type that encourages redditors to share their opinion via voting. We’ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months, and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!

**Why Polls?**

It can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit, , and to feel a sense of community.

**Platform Support**

* iOS: Supports poll creation and voting
* Android: Supports poll creation and voting **(EDIT: there is a bug on old versions of Android that cause the app to crash for some redditors when they vote. Updating the app to the new version will fix it.)**
* New Reddit (web): Supports poll creation and voting
* Old Reddit (web): Does not support creation. At the bottom of a poll, redditors will see a link to view the poll. Clicking the link will open a new tab where they can view results and vote in the poll
* Mobile web: Supports voting. No plans for poll creation support

Advice/experience?",20,TwoXChromosomes,https://redd.it/fsez1c,15,"As I grow older I am realizing that despite me being a bit eccentric and not the most heteronormative person, and despite considering myself someone of open mind, it is my fault I can't socialize with other women. I was always around older boys growing up. I get along with boys better and always just blamed my 'wiring' or dude brain. But I am seeing that my rejection on gender roles put on me in the church and in my childhood coupled with lack of good feminine role models and girl friends growing up and my innate preferabce of 'boy' style and activity caused me to believe most traits stereotypical of women and girls were weak and not to be respected, because I never was. 

I deeply regret i didnt realize my 'not like other girls' phase in middle school and high school wasnt the fault of other girls, but from my own dissatisfaction of how feminity was seen and treated and an attempt to distance myself from something that might label me as weak and unrespectable.

As an adult I still can't seem to make famale friends even though I have tried. Partly i think i just dont jive with a lot of people regardless, but i think I have dropped the ball on many potential friendships due to gender.

fs7ucd,francinebeenfrensky,I hate that my rapist ex-boyfriend gets off scot-free while I have to suffer,93,TwoXChromosomes,https://redd.it/fs7ucd,7,"I broke up with my ex almost three months ago. We dated for five months. We are both 19. At the three months mark he stealthed me, the main contributor to me breaking up with him. I've realized since that it wasn't the first, nor the only time that he raped/sexually assaulted me. Very early in the relationship he forcefully penetrated me with his fingers, he had a propensity for coercing me into sexual activities when I had no interest in partaking in them, and also had a propensity for making out with me when I was inebriated or asleep. 

I recently contacted his ex-girlfriend (while my ex and I were dating he always said that we probably would get along) and she told me that a big contributor to the reason she broke up with him is because she felt pressured to partake in sexual activities that she was not comfortable with. 

Whereas I once missed him, even felt bad for him, believed his apologies, I'm just furious. These last few months have easily been the worst of my life. Not only did I lose someone that I absolutely adored, I've lost a really close friend of mine who decided to side with my ex over me, and I've lost my ability to trust other people almost entirely. The thought of sex repulses me at best and terrifies me at worst, and I'm still trying to figure out my triggers, which seem to occur with no rhyme or reason.

I used to look at his Twitter account and I remember how much of his timeline was him essentially begging for sympathy and moping. And his followers would always clamour to his comments ensuring him that he's loved and that they are there for him.

I don't care if it's selfish or resentful, it infuriates me that the most he's lost from this is his girlfriend and that I'm the one who has to suffer. I hate that he has friends who are blissfully unaware of what he did and think that I'm the bad guy who broke his heart. I just hate that I'm the one who has to suffer from this. I wish that there was some kind of ramification to his actions.

I was depressed, suicidal even. I didn't want to celebrate my birthday. I isolated myself and got annoyed when people said they were coming over to celebrate my birthday, yet they came anyway. I didn't appreciate it back then, I was in a very dark place.

This year I have reconnected with my family and friends. I also have a new loving, caring, and amazing boyfriend. I had so many plans for spring break (I live in FL) and my birthday. I had plans to enjoy my time with my loved ones- the ones that were with me even when I didn't want them there. 

Unfortunately, now that I want them here and will actually accept and appreciate their love...I can't see them. Last year I wasn't with my (ex) boyfriend on my birthday because he only brought me negativity, and he didn't care enough to show up anyway. This year I'm not with my current boyfriend because he is an essential worker and he is keeping me safe by staying away. How ironic, right?

Yes, I'm sad. But more than anything I am extremely grateful. Grateful that I am in a better place. Grateful that I am surrounded by so much love. Most of all, I'm grateful that no one is here (physically) celebrating with me. I'm glad everyone is home, taking this quarantine seriously. I'm glad that everyone I know is safe. Thankfully, no one I know has been affected by this terrible virus- that is the best gift of all. 

This horrible virus is affecting so many people around the world and it's scary. Please take this time to appreciate the little things. Reach out to your loved ones. Take care of yourselves.

fsiwsy,tormentalist,She gave me anything my heart desired... it wasn't enough.,220,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsiwsy,3,"I used to go hiking to clear my mind.

It was nothing extraordinary. No backpack, no walking stick, no geo-locator app on my phone - just casual walks through White Leaf park. It wasn't so much a hobby for me as it was a way to pass the time, if that makes sense. Something to do and enjoy without placing any real expectations on it. Sometimes I'd spend hours watching the new crop of butterflies migrating, other afternoons I'd just take a brisk stroll to forget about a specific customer at work.

I worked in sales, as a cashier, specifically. Good Books, the soulless chain store that changed its name to ""BOOX!"", exclamation mark included, for a brief period in 2006. When I was a teenager, it seemed like an easy job with the added benefit of getting my hands on new releases before anyone else. In my twenties, however, the charm of reading the latest committee-scripted franchise novel was a lot less appealing. I started spending more time staring at the kiosk of adult calendars than anything else.

If you ever want to know what it's like to feel alone in a public place, work in a book store. It has all the deathly quiet of a library, combined with the social ineptitude of every awkward introvert you avoided in high school. Lord help you if you start a conversation with anyone, at any time, because they're going to explain their favorite author or preferred genre of literature as if you haven't heard of it. All you can do is nod periodically.

It was around sunset when I went to White Leaf, that night. There was a spot I where I liked to chill out, maybe work through a few pages of a tale I wasn't actually very interested in, and convince myself that the world was still a magical place beyond the beige walls of my self-made consumerist prison.

I don't know if it was because of the waning light, but I think it took several minutes for me to realize I was on the wrong path. Instead of the normal gravel bed that had been laid out by the park service, I found myself on a foot-beaten rut of dark soil walled by knee-high weeds. Realizing I must have let my mind wander enough to get moderately lost, I turned around and headed back.

Still, the path progressed deeper into the trees. Even after completely turning the way I'd just come from, I still seemed to be going the wrong way. As the setting sun dropped below the leaves, and night started to creep in, I found mild relief in a small clearing. From there, I could check for landmarks and get a better idea of where I was. At the end of the day, which was now literally approaching, I could always just swallow my pride and phone someone for help.

I hadn't been in that specific clearing before, that much was immediately clear. A large, blue-green pond laid at the center of the area, ringed with cattails and milkweed. Dragonflies skimmed the water, leaving a labyrinthine pattern in their tiny wakes. I had stumbled onto a nature painting, but all I cared about in the moment was getting back on track.

I had just given up on figuring out where I was when I heard the bubbles. A burst of air swelled up from the otherwise still body of water, breaking the silence with a wet belch so raucous that I left the ground for a moment.

Turning from the glow of my phone, to the dimly moonlit pond, I quickly prepared to run from whatever primordial animal had made its home there. I hadn't seen an alligator in the park, and wasn't even sure if they lived there, but the thought had crossed my mind every time I passed any hidden body of water.

Instead, I watched a fluttering expanse of pure white float to the surface.

Cloth.

Clothing.

Shrouded in the white, I could see a human form. Someone had fallen in, and the air that had escaped must have been their last breath before drowning. All fear of aquatic reptiles and distaste for leeches flew free from my head as I rushed to the pond's edge. My haste was dampened as the slog through muck and push-back of water against my legs turned a heroic dash into an awkward waddle.

As I came out, dragging the limp body as best I could, my eyes searched frantically for the path back out of the area. There would be no way I could call 911 and give accurate directions at that point. In the heat of the moment, it seemed like there was no longer any path at all.

Moving the cloth from the drowning victim's face, I was found yet another dreadful mockery of my fragile concept of reality. The body was long dead. Emaciated. Beyond any sort of identification. Eyes rotted out into dark pits, stringy hair clumped and matted. There was absolutely no way this was a recent cadaver.

My grip loosened from sheer shock and disgust, and in a final act of defiance against the laws of nature, the thing grasped onto me instead.

""Never return to this place."" its rasping voice croaked, water spilling from its fetid mouth.

I jumped to my feet and, turning away from the horrifying thing, took one of the many paths that now lead into the thick brush around me. I screamed, called for help, yelled unintelligible, cowardly things. All the while, the voice called out from the shore of that cursed pond.

""Never-ever-ever-ever-ever!!""

I stopped an attendant at the park exist and gave him a more conservative run-down of what I had found. He seemed more interested in getting back to picking up trash. I let it go easily, convinced I that saying anything at all was more than should be expected of me in that situation.

It was their problem, now. Fair warning.

I stayed out of the park. I had no interest in going back, and it wasn't just because of the warning that sopping abomination had uttered. No one needed to tell me to stay away, after that.

I was distant for a while. Lost in my own repetitive thoughts, and trapped in a spiral of internal dread that I couldn't express to another living soul. I phoned it in at work, even more so than before, and I went straight home afterward to wrap myself up in bed and - what else - read.

That glassy-eyed malaise made it all the more confusing when, out of the blue, my boss made a baffling offer.

The company, Good Books,  was looking for a new ""Regional Buyer"". Someone to oversee the largely automated system of selecting and purchasing products to be shelved in various outlets across the country. As I was told, it was a position that should have been phased out long ago, but didn't seem to get enough attention to be dealt with. Basically, I would be getting paid a much larger salary, with benefits, in return for clicking an ""Approved"" button as needed.

I could do it from my damned phone, if I wanted to.

The boss wanted to recommend me for the position. He was close to retirement and didn't have the desire to ""learn computer"", otherwise he would've taken the position himself. When I asked why he wanted me, of all people, he said something won't forget.

""You're a smart guy, and you don't belong stuck here. A little voice told me to pick you.""

Suddenly, there was a newer and much more pleasant event in my life to focus on. I won't say I forgot all about the horrific encounter. No, that's definitely going to stick with me forever, and even then I knew it. However, if I concentrated on it enough, the job opportunity was exciting enough to consume my thoughts.

That same night, I broke a personal rule. I accepted a party invitation from one of my fellow wage slaves. He congratulated me on the possible promotion, then dropped mention that he was going to a ""sick college party"" that night. I don't know if he meant we should celebrate, or if he just wanted to bring up that he, too, was going to have a good night. Either way, he asked if I'd be interested, and I agreed to attend. (I could always be a prick and decide not to go later on, anyway.)

When he said ""a little voice"" said I might like to go, I considered the idea he had overheard the conversation I had earlier.

I feel like I've always stuck out at parties, but it might just be in my own head. It's entirely possible that the awkwardness goes unnoticed by everyone else, especially if they're trying to hide their own shortcomings as well. Still, every conversation that night was on some pop culture topic I knew nothing about, and I wasn't even sure how anyone could hold a conversation above the host's horrible, blaring soundtrack.

Before I knew it, I found myself naturally retreating to the rooms with the smallest amounts of party-goers, furthest away from the noise. I ended up in someone's bedroom, a place I wouldn't have dared invade if not for the fact others a few others had already hidden there.

I mean, I know other people were in the room... but for the life of me, I couldn't tell you who they were, or anything about them.

Except for her, of course -- a leggy, cool-as-ice girl with glossy black hair and tortoise shell glasses. She was reclining on the bed as if she owned the place, and was leafing through an old Lovecraft collection she must've found on a dusty shelf.

""Hey,"" I gave a quick, out-of-place nod, ""Great party, huh?""

I tried to sound sarcastic, since both of us were obviously hiding from it, but I think it came across as tragically sincere.

""Thrilling."" she replied, eyes still on the book. Her sarcastic tone was on point, but I was just happy to get a response.

""Lovecraft, huh?"" I choked back a sudden tickle in my throat that nearly set off an unattractive coughing fit, ""Ehm - Old Gods are the best Gods, am I right?""

She slowly lowered the book and looked up at me with wide eyes.

""You..."" she arched a brow, tilting her head to the side, ""You're a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, too?""

I nodded enthusiastically as she turned her attention back away from me.

""Wooww,"" the sarcasm struck out again like a serpent that had lain coiled in her throat, ""This must be fate.""

I felt my face turn red. I knew I'd make an ass of myself that night, but that was an new level of gut-wrenching.

I was about to turn and clumsily push my way out the door when she looked up at me again. She scooted over, dropped the book onto the other side of the bed, and patted for me to sit next to her.

""Read to me. My eyes are tired.""

Fittingly enough, her name was Paige.

It would be a year and half later, after we were engaged, when I finally asked exactly why she decided to humor me that night.

""There was this little voice that told me to give you a second chance.""

I want to say my life was perfect, but that wouldn't do it justice. No one really wants a perfect life. The flaws are what make everything work, you know? The job paid well and allowed me the freedom to start planning my own business... but reading through lists of orders and okaying each one was boring as Hell. Paige was a god damned dream, but we had our disagreements from time to time - mostly over what to name our cat. The house we moved into was beautiful, with a spacious lawn and great neighbors who didn't bother us. However, the pipes needed work and the seller had neglected to tell us the attic was a popular home for yellow jackets.

It was perfect, but not too perfect to enjoy.

That ""little voice"" had done well for me. The realtor heard it when he decided to show us that property, which he was thinking of saving for a friend. The lady at the animal shelter heard the voice when she pulled our kitty off of death row and decided we would be the one family that might actually keep him.

It didn't take too many examples of the voice before I connected it back to that night in the pond.

I didn't understand it, not entirely, but I had read enough to recognize the general premise. It was possible... just barely possible... that I had made some kind of contract with whatever eldritch being I had encountered. By finding it, or trying to save it, or freeing it from its watery grave in some way, I unknowingly entered into a deal that changed my life for the better.

My mind swapped things around a bit, and in order to make sense of it all, I started thinking of the thing as a  genie or guardian angel. The dread and panic I felt in that moment? Why not just sort of push those feelings to the back of my mind, and enjoy the idea that it was less horrifying than I was making it out to be? Sometimes, your brain avoids bad thoughts or memories on its own - but I was more than willing to just let it happen.

In my spare time, I watched a lot of do-it-yourself videos online. I turned a spare room into a small library for Paige, and pretended it was a surprise even though I'm sure she would sneak in there when I wasn't home and check on the progress. She was way too inquisitive to let anything lie, and had zero tolerance for being told what to do. I fucking loved it.

It confused me when she'd cry at night.

Everything was perfectly imperfect. I had everything I wanted. I was happy.

Why wasn't she?

I woke up a few times, to hear her weeping softly in the adjacent bathroom. When I passed the library I'd built for her, I could hear her crying beyond the locked door. Her sadness was the one flaw I couldn't stand - I didn't want her to be in pain. I didn't ask what was wrong, because each time I heard her, I should have been asleep or at least not spying on her. It was a difficult subject to get my head around.

Then, I accidentally stepped on the landmine.

We were having breakfast, sitting across from each other as she buried her nose in an embarrassing young adult novel that made her roll her eyes and chortle every few minutes. I had just watched a video about building a play room. The site had recommended it, and the designs looked interesting.

""You know,"" I chewed thoughtfully on burnt toast, ""We've never really talked about having kids.""

The book snapped shut. Paige drew a sharp breath in through her nose, and in seconds I watched her eyes fill with tears.

""Honey? What's wrong?""

She all but collapsed in sobs.

She couldn't have children. I tried to be as sensitive as I could, given the bomb that had been dropped on me. It was a casual thought I had expressed, nothing serious, but now I had brought on something terrible. Nothing I said could console her, from insisting that I didn't care, to reminding her that I loved her more than anything, to suggesting that if she ever wanted to, we could adopt.

I spit out a frantic litany of promises and possibilities as I knelt on the kitchen floor next her chair and held her in my arms. Not in a million years would I have imagined that such a non-traditional person secretly held such a traditional desire.

Nothing I could say was enough to make it better.

From that point forward, I didn't think of that corpse in the lake as my personal genie. This was the twist. The price for my Faustian bargain. I could be happy, eternally happy, but the woman I loved wouldn't be. I could have whatever I wanted, but Paige just got me - and I knew I wasn't enough, even if she didn't.

The breaking point was when I found her dream book. It was tucked away on a shelf in the library, a completely unremarkable beige journal you'd pick up in any given craft store. I didn't intend to read it, I wouldn't break our trust like that. However, when I noticed she had been putting it away one night after a crying session, I decided to at least check out what the book was.

When I removed it from the shelf to look for a title, three pictures fell out and scattered on the floor. They had been cut out of magazines. Women with dark hair, glasses, similar to Paige. All holding their newborn children.

I was emotionally destroyed. All of the hopeless yearning that had been imbued in that book pulsed through me in waves of black melancholy.

I let anger take over. Anger toward life, toward fate, toward the dead wretch that had cursed me in a way so devious that I mistook it for a blessing.

After loading some light hiking gear into the car, I told Paige that I wanted to take her out for a special surprise. Something that would be fun, ""just because"". In true form, she refused to go without knowing everything - but I was eventually able to convince her to trust me. With a reasonable amount of sighing and groaning, we were off.

""Where are we going?"" she asked periodically.

""Not telling."" I would reply, doing my best to sound joyfully mischievous.

""I get to ask 20 questions, and you have to answer them.""

""Nope.""

""Let me hold your phone for a second, I need check something.""

""I don't have the destination marked on it. Nice try, though.""

As we got closer to the park, she grew quiet. I could tell that her mind was working. I could almost hear the gears grinding. Not knowing something drove her crazy, but if I told her where we were headed or why, then I'd be the crazy one.

The glare she gave me when we drove into the parking lot at White Leaf could've frozen magma.

""You're not serious."" she folded her arms.

""Trust me.""

I knew there was a 99% chance I wouldn't find that clearing again. In that case, I was prepared to explain that I wanted to show her my favorite reading spot from the days before we'd met. I'd come up with some romantic words about nature and time and spending our lives together - and I'd mean every word of it. The real goal of that trip could easily be hidden away if it didn't work out.

The sun was setting again by the time I noticed we had gotten off the established trails.

""I don't think we should keep going."" Paige noted, and in any other circumstance, I would have completely agreed.

""I want to show you something. It's just a bit further.""

The clearing opened up in front of us. The pond was as calm and foreboding as I had remembered. A chill ran through my body, and it wasn't due to the crisp night air. I heard Paige crunching the leaves behind me as I lead her to the edge of the water.

""Okay, so..."" I started, unsure of what to actually say, ""Just bear with me on this for a bit.""

I looked into the water, but couldn't see past its inky surface. The moonlight wasn't helping.

""Hey!"" I called out. ""Look, I know what you did, okay? I know what you've done for me, and I think I get what's going on. Every gift has its price, and all that. Standard folk tale stuff...""

""You need to stop."" Paige chided. I ignored her, I knew what I was doing.

""Just give that same gift to my fiance, Paige. Okay? Like, set her up with the deal. A perfect life, little voices, all that. Can't you let her have what she wants more than anything?""

Nothing stirred in the pond. In the distance, a frog croaked its unnecessary reply.

I stood at the water's edge for as long as I could stand the icy silence. Reluctantly, I shut my eyes tight, grimaced at my own ignorant failure, and turned to explain away what must've looked like sheer insanity.

""I said never."" Paige moaned. The sorrow in her voice was heavy.

When I looked back at her, I stumbled backward, landing in the murky water.

It was her, but it wasn't her. Paige stood with her head hung low, a blurred, fading smudge on the face of the universe.

All at once, I was looking at the decaying body that had haunted my subconscious for so long.

""Never."" she repeated, water cascading over exposed, obsidian-black teeth. ""Never-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever!""

I felt myself sink backward into the muck, as the pond enveloped me and blocked out my senses. Choking and gasping for air, I hauled myself up from the water and pulled on a fist-fulls of rugged weeds until I managed to drag myself out.

It was gone. She was gone.

Forever.

I still have the job... the house... the cat... Nothing disappeared, or anything like that. The lack of ""magic"" in my life is shockingly evident, even though I didn't fully recognize it when it was there. It's obvious that something very rare and special is absent.

I haven't been able to find the clearing again. I went to White Leaf every day for the following three months, and I mean it when I say EVERY day. Now, I hike out each week so I can camp out and search for full 24 hour periods. I'm not going to stop, even though I know in my heart that I won't find it again.

Once in a while, a little voice tells me to give up.

[I won't listen to it. Never-ever-ever.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083F7RRVN)",1585681203.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsiwsy/she_gave_me_anything_my_heart_desired_it_wasnt/
fspwbr,AGirl__Unwritten,Corrupted Memory,6,nosleep,https://redd.it/fspwbr,0,"My name is Elena Cooper. Uh . . . hi.

I know how crazy this story will sound but I have to tell it and this is the best way I can think of to do it. I'll do my best to recount everything with as much accuracy as I can regardless of the large chunks of memory I can't account for. It's my hope that someone reading this might be able to glean some sort of insight from what happened to me. That if this finds the right person, they might be able to help.

Dylan was my best friend, and I call him that by the most clinical definition of the word. If I ever ended up in the hospital or stuck on the side of the road he was the one I would call. We made something of a habit of sleeping together when loneliness set in and we had no one else. But that was it. No brunch on Sunday mornings. No gossiping about our dating lives. No late-night phone calls that lasted until dawn. Dylan himself was very clinical, which I suppose is why our relationship functioned the way it did.

For some unknown reason, I loved him.

We had plans to see some new horror movie. It's funny, I wanted so much to see it and it was so important to me then but now I can't remember what it was. All I can see now when I try to remember is the bright neon of the theater name overhead. The low hum of people going in and out of the huge glass doors on the side of the building. The way the chilly October air made me shiver. I drew my leather jacket close as I looked around for Dylan.

I checked the time on my phone. Fifteen minutes until the movie started.

He still had time. He could still make it.

In hindsight, I don't know if I cared as much about the movie itself as I did about seeing it with him. Why else would I have waited? It wasn't as if this would've been the first or last movie I saw alone. Eight minutes.

Over by a light in the parking lot, I saw him approach. My heart lifted and a smile came to my face. There he was! He looked as cool as ever. His long dark hair brushed against his shoulders as he walked. He threw his whole weight into each step as if he'd seen too many Japanese Yakuza movies featuring low-level thug characters and wanted to emulate their attitude. He had his hands in the pockets of his black, torn jeans. Even in the dark, he wore sunglasses.

I bit back my smile and walked from the beacon of light around the entrance to the theater into the great, crushing night. Dylan had a cigarette in his mouth. He took a hand out of his pocket, plucked the short white stub of tobacco from his lips, and blew a heavy cloud of smoke into the air. I crossed my arms as if I was angry. If Dylan knew how happy I was to see him and that I liked him, he would have dropped me.

“You almost made us late.”

“Yeah,” he said. He dropped the corpse of his cigarette to the asphalt and snuffed it out with his shoe. “I don't want to see that dumb movie.”

He might as well have punched me in the stomach.

“Well then, what would you rather do?”

Dylan nodded towards the parking lot, indicating his car. When he started walking back in that direction I followed like I knew he expected me to.

We reached his car on the far side of the lot. Everyone else parked close to the theater and the last line of spotlights ended several stalls away from the one Dylan chose. I turned to look back at the theater as he fished his keys out of his pocket.

“Look, I know you're an advocate of antisocial parking but this is ridiculous—”

Dylan's hand came down hard over my mouth. He had something in it. Pills. I kicked and screamed and tried to fight my way out of Dylan's arms. How could he do this? *What* was he even *doing*? He was my *best friend* and he—he—

My mind raced and raced and raced until it devolved into a blank nothingness that kept any and all thought from invading the mire. Tears poured down my cheeks as the pills made their way down my throat.

I gave one final choking sob before my body went limp and weak. Dylan shoved me into the backseat of his car. He slammed the door shut—a sound which echoed all around me like a gunshot—got into the driver's side—my vision began to blur here, and I couldn't hear him when he shut the door—and put his key in the ignition. I faded away before he started driving.

The next time I opened my eyes a blinding white light burned into them. I groaned and tried to shield them against this tyrannical, sterile brightness but found that I couldn't move my arms. I wanted to scream. I tried to. I felt tears running down the sides of my face. A shiver quaked through my body and I realized I was chilled to the bone, particularly on my back, which laid straight and flat to the point that my spine ached. Whatever it was, it was cold. The sensation bit into my flesh.

My *flesh*?

Though my head still swam and the edges of my vision were blurred I still managed to pull my head up and look down—at my naked body.

A strangled cry tore out of my throat.

Dylan—Dylan—*where* was Dylan?

He had to be there somewhere. My mind rolled over itself trying to remember what had happened. Like my physical vision, my mental vision blurred. It was like I was looking down a long tunnel where the edges of things were fuzzy and most of the details were obscured, but the harder I focused the more I remembered.

I'd gone to see a movie. With Dylan.

He took me back to his car.

*He drugged me*.

After that? I couldn't remember. It didn't matter that I pushed my mind until it ached. The best I could conjure up was a vague sense of being awash in a dazzling blue light . . .

“Good specimen, yes, yes, very good.” A voice from somewhere over my head. High pitched and chirping like a nervous bird. “We must do tests! I have this thing here—can we poke it with it?”

Dylan came into view overhead. His long hair fell in silky strands on either side of his square jaw. I began sobbing anew. I'm not sure if I actually made any noise but inside I was screaming.

If I could speak, I would've asked why. Why did he drug me? Why did he kidnap me? Why couldn't he love me? He put his hand on the side of my face. Rough and large. Without meaning to I closed my eyes and buried my face in that hand. I wanted to conjure up more pleasant memories of him to keep me company—only to find them poisoned by what he did.

“You're a good girl, Elena.” He purred when he spoke. I opened my eyes and in the fractured, watery way my brain now saw the world, I watched as his long hair fell from him. Strand-by-strand, it floated free of his scalp and settled on my bare stomach. His skin peeled away like wet wax and revealed beneath it new and ugly flesh I didn't recognize. Gray and covered in small scales like a fish. His eyes, which had once been blue, turned black even in the white parts.

Dylan walked away, his hand sliding away from my left cheek and across the whole of my face as he did. He muttered something I couldn't hear.

The other person, whoever it was, gave a child-like little cheer and came into view. By then I felt like the world was a dome rolling around above me. I couldn't focus. I did manage to realize, though, that this new person looked like what Dylan was becoming. Gray skin with fish-like scales, bald, with almond-shaped black eyes. This new creature held a syringe between his long, frog-like fingers. White-hot nuclear pain exploded throughout my entire body as it punctured me with the syringe. That time I know I screamed. And cried. The creature that stuck me with the syringe giggled and shuffled out of sight.

More muttering—and more people. Or creatures. Or whatever. They stayed out of sight but within earshot. My brain was so gone by then that I had no idea what they were saying or what they were doing.

I heard the high pitched one. He sounded angry. I couldn't make out the words but it sounded like the others put him in a tantrum. The others got louder. The high pitched one got quiet.

Five faces, all with the same skin and eyes as the high-pitched one and what Dylan began to morph into, peered over me. My heart raced. My mouth went dry.

They gave me something—I don't know what. I don't even remember *how* they gave it to me. All I know for sure is I went to sleep and when I woke up again I was in the hospital.

The mundane nature of the room startled me. The stink of disinfectant and sickness clung to the faded pastel pink wallpaper. Above my bed, a large portrait of a boat at sea done in watercolors. Machines stood all around me, beeping along with the changing numbers on the screens. The increase in my heart rate sent a nurse running into the room.

Panicked, I asked her what happened. She was a nice, small woman with a smile that could make anyone feel like her friend. She told me how my friend brought me to the hospital. My first thought was of Dylan. How everything I thought I saw must've been a dream. I wanted to laugh. Or cry.

“By the way,” the nurse said as she came over to the machines by my bed and wrote down the information they had on them. I wished, stupid and delirious, that I knew what they said. I'd always wondered but never bothered looking into it. “Your baby is doing fine. Would you like to see him?”

“My . . . baby?” 

The nurse smiled and nodded to the hospital cradle by my bed.

I turned, slowly.

I wasn't pregnant. I wasn't. So why did she say I had a baby?

Yet there it was. A baby with a “BABY BOY” card above its head. It yawned, stretched its little pink arms as high as they would go, then looked at me with empty black eyes.",1585704528.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fspwbr/corrupted_memory/

This update is going to be a little crazy but I think you’ll be able to guess some of how it ends simply because I’m here, typing this out.

I’m splitting this up into two posts because there *is* a character limit here and yeah, I hit it, and I had to pick a good spot to break it in two.  Sorry not sorry.  I’m sure you’ve all noticed by now, but I dislike brevity.  If I’m going to tell you what happened, I’m going to tell you *everything*.

The man with no shadow came at midnight. I’d given myself one last sunset, before going inside for the evening.  It was muted by clouds, a have of mauve, deeping to puce along the ridge of the ebony trees.  I watched from my front porch, wondering if it would be the last sunset I would see, here in my family’s house where I was raised and where my parents died and where all my prior generations have sheltered from the terrors of the night.

Then I waited inside by the window, watching.

Two figures approached from the road.  The man with no shadow’s hair shone, catching the moonlight.  Beside him was a shorter figure, unrecognizable in the gloom, his shadow stretching long beside him.  The little girl waited for them at the fence and the man with no shadow spoke to her and she turned and left, her steps dragging reluctantly in the damp grass.  Then he came and knocked on my front door.

“Invite us in, Kate,” the man with no shadow said gently.

I did.  I suppose that was part of our agreement from the grove.

His companion was the buyer.  My cousin.  He glanced around him in delight, taking in the aged wooden crossbeams of the ceiling, the dated wallpaper, and the photographs of my family from when I was a child that I didn’t have the heart to replace.

“This is quaint,” he finally said.  “It’s very charming.  I can see why you’ve been so reluctant to part with it, Kate.  But I think it’ll be for the best.  That incident with the town hall was horrible and now everyone can put all this behind them.”

For a moment I was stunned.  The buyer had no idea what was really happening here.  He didn’t seem like he was under the man with no shadow’s control because *he wasn’t*.  He was just being duped.

Behind him, out of eyeshot of the buyer, the man with no shadow gave me a thin, warning smile.  He set a stack of paper and a seal on the table.

“Let’s get this all signed,” the man with no shadow said.  “I normally don’t work this late.”

“Of course, of course.”

The buyer hastily sat down at the dining room table and waited patiently.  I joined them more slowly, my back to the wall.  The man with no shadow flipped over the first page and shoved it towards me.  I took it, mechanically, and there was something tight in my chest and my fingers were numb.

“It’s all pretty standard sale of a property,” the man with no shadow said tonelessly.  “Give it a read and then initial at the bottom.”

He pushed a pen in my direction.  I took it.  I initialed.  I couldn’t *not* initial.  Like a hand was over my own, guiding my motions.  I wanted to scream, I wanted to weep, but I only stared stupidly at the papers that the man with no shadow was handing me, one by one, dryly explaining what each one was before asking for an initial and then collecting them to form a second stack of completed paperwork.  Across from me, the buyer waited anxiously, excited in his ignorance as to what was happening here.

“So how do you two know each other?” I asked.

The words came with difficulty.  It was like my mouth was full of sap and my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth.  The man with no shadow’s eyes narrowed with annoyance.

“Oh, we don’t really know each other,” the buyer said.  “I just got a recommendation for a notary in town and called her and then she said she couldn’t do it for several weeks but then she called me back an hour ago, apologizing for interrupting so late, saying that she’d just heard from a friend and he could finalize the sale but he’d only be in town until tomorrow.  So I needed to get down to the campsite as soon as I could if I wanted everything signed in a reasonable timeframe.  And sure, it’s midnight, but she said she’d checked with everyone and you were both fine with it.”

The notary was under the man with no shadow’s control.  That knowledge was useless to me now.

“It is late, isn’t it,” I sighed.  “Do you want some tea?”

The buyer happily agreed.  I got up and went into the kitchen.  Behind me, the man with no shadow excused himself to help.  I forced myself to focus on filling the kettle, even when he came up behind me and stood at my back, mere inches apart.  I felt his breath on the back of my head.

“You’re *stalling*,” he hissed.

“Damn right I am,” I replied.  “What happens if I stall long enough to get past the midnight hour?”

A special time of night.  When the day ends and a new one begins.  The significance was not lost on me.

“That won’t happen.  You agreed to finish before then.”

I stepped back, forcing him to move lest I step on his toes.  He hovered close by, looming over me as I turned on the stove and began pulling out cups while the water heated.

“Did our agreement stipulate that I had to get this done as quickly as possible?” I asked tersely.

“No,” he admitted.  “I wish I had.”

“What happens after the campground belongs to the buyer?”

I turned and found myself face-to-face with him.  He stared down at me with a hatred that I suppose I’d earned by now.

“I drag you back to my grove and devour your shadow, bit by bit.  I’ll rip your shadow’s legs off first, so you can’t escape, and then take my time with the rest of you.  Perhaps if you hadn’t been so *difficult* I would have given you a quick death but… I’m not inclined to do so anymore.  It could be days, Kate,” he whispered.  “Weeks, even.”

He half-raised his hand and I felt something brush along the back of my arm, like the touch of a moth’s wings.  I glanced aside and saw his hand poised so that his shadow - if it existed - would be touching my own.

The kettle began to scream on the stove.  I turned to take it off and pour and briefly thought I could just fling the boiling water right in his face.

“None of that, now,” he admonished.  “We have an agreement.”

He returned to the dining room.  I was a little slower to follow, carrying a tray of tea.  I confess that I used the lady with extra eye’s tea for the man with no shadow’s cup and he took one sip, coughed violently, and stared daggers at me while I finished initializing the rest of the pages.

The last page.  I stared at it, startled to see my own demise in such an innocuous thing.  A single piece of paper.  An empty line where my signature was going to go.  My fingers rested on the pen.

“I know it’s overwhelming,” the buyer chirped.  “But like you said yourself - this will be a *good* change.  You can even go back to school and finish your degree like you wanted to, right?”

I really wish I’d remembered what our conversation on the phone had been.  No doubt I’d made the call from the grove under the man with no shadow’s guidance.  The buyer was still chattering about how I could always come back and visit, of course, and how he could even keep me on as assistant manager or something since he’ll probably need help in the transition period.  I wasn’t paying attention, my focus entirely on the single piece of paper that would put an end to all of this.

I only snapped out of my daze because he’d stopped talking.

“Do you hear someone… crying?” he asked.

“That’s the little girl,” I replied dully.  “The one you saw at the fence.  She killed my mother.  Don’t worry about her, she can’t get inside.”

The buyer stared in consternation at the window behind me.  The little girl’s weeping came from the other side of the glass.  The man with no shadow was silently digging his nails into the surface of the table and staring at me in outright hatred.

I picked up the pen.

And as the little girl wept behind me, I had a moment of clarity.

I stood.  I turned, ostensibly to untie the drapes and let them cover the blinds with another layer to block the noise, but instead I grabbed the cord and yanked the blinds up.  Then, as the man with no shadow began to call my name and demand I stop, I opened the window.

And the little girl started to climb in, her shoulders heaving with her sobs as she stretched out her hands to clutch at either side of the wall.

“No!” the man with no shadow shouted, standing and lunging for me.  His fingers closed around my wrist and he began dragging me away from the window.  “I haven’t worked *this hard* to let you win!”

He wasn’t speaking to me.  I realized this, distantly, as he pulled me through the house and towards the front door while the crying of the little girl drifted after us.  He was speaking to *her*.

“*Move* Kate,” he swore.  “Damn you!”

Behind us, the buyer began to scream.  A long, uninterrupted shriek.  I know it well.  It is the scream of someone that is in the process of dying and cannot do anything to save themselves, but nor can they hasten their demise.

The man with no shadow dragged me through the house and to the front door.  Ripped it open and switched his grip to the front of my shirt before dragging me behind him across the yard.  Getting me over the property line.  Only once we were past the road and in the field that led to the forest did he pause and spin to face me, his hand still tight in the fabric of my shirt.

“New plan,” he snarled.  “I rip you apart right here.  You get a fast - albeit agonizing - death after all.  Then I start this *all over* with your fucking brother.”

I laughed, hearing the touch of hysteria in my own voice.

“Your buyer is dead,” I said mockingly.  “She’s probably spreading his intestines across the walls.  What are you going to do about *that*?”

Pain shot through my abdomen.  I doubled over but did not fall, some terrible pressure held me up.  I doubled up around it, like a spike in my gut, the pain lancing all the way through to my back.  I coughed and tasted blood.

“I’ll figure it out,” the man with no shadow said calmly.  “You might want to save your breath for screaming.  It might help with the pain.”

Another burst of agony, higher up, just below my ribs.  I did scream.  Like the buyer had.

“Or perhaps it won’t,” the man with no shadow said thoughtfully.

And then he pitched backwards with a cry of his own, I was dropped to the ground, and a gunshot echoed through the night sky.

The old sheriff isn’t an idiot.  He knew that something was wrong and while I wasn’t going to ask for help, he should still keep watch with his rifle.

I struggled to stand.  My fingers clutched at my abdomen as pain lanced through my body and my lungs seized up in reflex.  Nothing but unbroken skin.  My shadow was what he attacked, I told himself firmly.  Only my shadow.  I could survive it - but only if I kept moving.

I took a second while the man with no shadow was reeling to take stock of my surroundings.  He’d dragged me out the front and down towards the woods.  The treeline was only a few yards away.

The sensible choice would have been the road.  The path to it was free of trees, hopefully giving the sheriff another shot.  Following it would get me off the property and out of the man with no shadow’s reach.  But he was between me and the road and he was getting to his feet, panting hard with pain, but his eyes were bright and remained focused on his quarry.

I chose the woods.

Perhaps it was instinct telling me where to go.  The woods are where we fight our monsters, after all, and emerge from them changed - or not at all.

Or perhaps I was blinded by pain and fear and merely got lucky.

I stumbled through the trees, catching myself on their trunks to keep my balance.  The man with no shadow followed in a dash, but he was not directly chasing me - he was trying to get under cover.  Another gunshot broke the silence and I used the noise to move quickly, just enough distance to break line of sight between us.

Then the hunt was on.  The man with no shadow pursued, but quietly, as a hunter stalks their prey.  I, too, tried to stifle my breathing and step carefully so as not to give away my position with an errant branch.  I can be quiet when I need to be.  We grew up in the woods, after all, and my brother and I played our games of chase and hide and seek.  When I was older, I hunted through these woods.  I’d learned my lessons well.

Still, despite the darkness and my silence, I could not quite shake the man with no shadow.  His pursuit was not entirely by human means and I could do nothing for his preternatural senses.

Then, as my strength waned and the pain of my injuries threatened to drag me to my knees, I put my hand out for support and while my fingers touched the cool bark before me, I could no longer see them.  I could no longer see anything at all.

All light had gone out.

Instinctively, I squeezed my eyes shut.  Somewhere behind me and to the right, I heard the man with no shadow stop as well.  His hiss of indrawn breath was stunningly loud in the forest and I knew exactly what his direction was.

The thing in the dark.  I could wait for it to pass.  And then what?  Resume the chase, one that I was losing by inches as the minutes slid by?  I’d broken his line of sight but I couldn’t simply hide and wait for him to pass by, as he seemed to be following through senses other than sight and hearing.  And while injured, he was not weakening as quickly as I was.  It was only a matter of time until he found me.

Or…

I turned.  The man with no shadow’s ragged breathing was faint, but there was no other sound in the woods at this moment.  I honed in on it, breaking into as fast of a run as I dared, my hands stretched out before me and I ran tree to tree, pulling myself forwards by touch alone.  All around me the forest began to shake.  It was like a strong wind, rattling the leaves and snapping the branches.  I heard the man with no shadow cry out - just enough sound to push me forwards those last few feet - and then my hand closed on his shirt.

“Here!” I cried.  “We’re here!”

And I opened my eyes.

The wind intensified.  I saw the dirt and leaves of the forest floor rise up around me in the gale, but there was still no light, it was like they were outlined on top of the darkness and somehow I could see regardless, and there was *something* alive in that wind.  Small pieces of debris struck my exposed skin like the sting of a wasp.  The man with no shadow grabbed my wrists, trying to pry himself free of me, but I did not relent.  We would die together.

Then we were falling.  All time seemed to stop and I froze, waiting for that final impact, and I *did* land hard on dry leaves and brittle branches.  But I was alive.  The wind was gone.  The air around us was cool and tasted damp.  There was no light.  My eyes widened, instinctively trying to find *some* spark of luminescence, but there was none.

“What have you *done*?” the man with no shadow hissed.  I heard him stand.

“I kind of expected us to die,” I said, also standing.  It left me breathless and I clutched at my abdomen and waited for the pain to pass.

“No.  This is *much* worse.”

I raised a hand and walked forwards until my fingers touched something.  I traced its contour gently, feeling the seam of wood stripped clean of bark, felt it curve upwards and downwards like the rib of a ship.  Then I felt it move away from my hand and I froze and then after a few minutes it drifted back and my fingers were once again touching its cool surface.

Like it was breathing.

I knew where we were.

fsmsp4,Raridan,I’m the son of an army ranger. I’m also the army’s greatest mistake.,16,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsmsp4,1,"I always had a good relationship with my father. He was an army veteran, and I would love it when he recounted war stories about his time in the jungles of Vietnam or the deserts of Kuwait. He would always tell me one before bed, about his time as an Army Ranger, when he led his team to liberate villages, negotiate hostages, and crush rival troops.

He was my hero.

When I grew older, I already knew that I wanted to go into the army. I ached to fight terror and be as much of a hero as my dad was. I had trained for years to be in pristine shape when I turned 18. I put in all the effort my dad did to achieve his level of prominence.

Night blindness. The inability to see in dim light or at night. So I couldn't see as well in the dark, I was ready. But the army decided that I wasn't. And with that, my lifelong dream, along with the work I put into it, was crushed.

I was just about to walk out the door when I felt a tap on my soldier. I spun around to find an army ranger standing in front of me. The ranger looked down on me, an impressive feat for a 6'7"" guy like myself. He had a solid, but weathered face, and a graying 5 o'clock shadow showing to be the only visible hair on his head. He had to be in his late '50s to early '60s, but his eyes showed otherwise. A hawk's eyes burned holes into my own as I stared up at the man.

""Could you come back with me Mr...""

The ranger stopped for a second to check the forms I had filled out at the start of the examination, before barking out, ""Ferguson"".

I followed him to one of the backrooms of the facility, where I sat facing him and a young Asian man in a white lab coat labeled ""Dr. Andrew Lee"".

The doctor stared at me and spoke, ""So Mr. Fergueson...""

""Walter is fine,"" I interjected

He looked at me almost non-amused and repeated, 'So Walter, we see that you are in pristine shape to serve our military. However, it appears that you suffer from extreme Nyctalopia, which forced us to not be able to accept you into the nation's military. There is, however, another option.""

I looked at him, now intrigued. ""What is it?""

Dr. Lee answered, ""The army is looking for ways to healthily increase the performance of soldiers. You would make for the perfect test subject. Would you be willing to join it?”

For a second, I hesitated. I thought that maybe I shouldn't do this. That I should just walk out of this building, become an engineer, get married, and forget about being in the army. But my father's face flashed into my mind, and I knew that there was only one answer.

""Of course sir.""

***

It would be another 3 months before I was flown out to an undisclosed military base in the middle of the wilderness. I know that said base in the US, but I could not begin to tell you which state it was in.

As soon as we arrived, I was strapped to a gurney and wheeled to a room that looked exactly like any other hospital room, minus a window. Understand that by hospital room, I mean horror movie hospital room. The ones where the light is always on, yet it always seems too dark. Where the white walls always seem gray and the room's door doubled as a heavy-duty locking system.

It was safe to say that I was immediately regretting my decision.

As the door was locked behind us, Dr. Lee reached into his medical cart and revealed a syringe filled with, from what I can guess, 1000 ml of a clear liquid. As I strained my eyes to look at it, I noticed the word ""Prodig-3"" written on the side of it. The Doctor inserted the needle into the crook of my left arm before unstrapping me and leaving.

Everything felt fine at first, but my body started aching about half an hour after I was administered the drug. It honestly felt like my body was fighting a war on itself. It felt foreign, yet it felt natural at the same time. My arms felt too long but too short. My legs felt like they were growing stronger than ever, but they are feeling as weak as cooked pasta at the same time. My entire body just felt right and wrong in every way possible. That is the only thing that can give justice to what I experienced.

After I was given a meal, I prayed. My dad was not only an army veteran, but he was also a deeply devoted Christian. My faith is another part of him that rubbed off on me. That night, I prayed for the sick and the elderly, but I prayed for answers too. Answers to this experiment. For example, what was the point? What was happening to me? Why?
No answers came.

The same thing happened the next day. Wake up, get injected with Prodig-3, eat, relax, pray, fall asleep. My schedule may have been common, but the side effects of the medication were not.

All that was happening to me was that I was getting taller and stronger, but it just felt wrong. I understand that my body was changing, but it wasn't changing the way it felt like it was changing. The way it felt, it was horrendous, like my molecules were individually splitting apart.

I have no idea how long passed before the cut. It seemed like a normal day until I noticed that the medical cart was bulkier than I remembered. I watched him reach on the cart and pull out a wolf's skull and a knife.
I was suddenly afraid. I thrashed in the restraints as he moved the knife closer to my head. I passed out, right before the knife touched me.

I woke up alone. The only comfort I had was my dinner. I raised the navy bean soup to my lips to notice that they're further forward than normal.

I lifted the metal spoon to my face.

Something unnatural stared back at me.
It had a lupine snout, with skin stretched over its elongated maw, and a pair of 16 point antlers sticking out of its head. It looked terrifying, but one factor made it much more horrifying than the monster itself.

That monster was me.

It was then that I prayed harder than I had ever prayed. I asked God why. Why do I suffer while sinners are relieved? Why is this the path I am told to take? Why does humanity see me as the monster instead of the monster wearing a white lab coat? 

I was lamenting in my thoughts when the lights went out.

A couple of subjects from a neighboring plant, 3 teenage boys named Erebus, Aodh, and Sleddog, had escaped and cut power to their facility and the surrounding facilities.
With this, all doors were unlocked.

As soon as I realized this, I burst through the now open door. I ran blindly, due to Night Blindness, trying to escape. I somehow reached the front doors and fled, not knowing where I was going until bright lights shone ahead of me.

The van stopped as soon as I scrambled out onto the road. That moment was one of the most terrifying moments in my life. I thought they'd turn tail and start running, sliding so wildly that they slam into a tree. Instead, a young boy with wavy, dirty blond hair and an almost square face walked out of the back. Despite the urgency that could be noticed on his face, he seemed confident. Which was surprising, acknowledging my freakish face and the fact that he was barely scraping 6 feet tall.

""Come on,"" he says in a deep voice. I can only stand in shock that he'd talk to me.

""We can help you, just get in the back,"" he yelled back at me. That was all it took for me to clamber into the back of the truck.

""First off, can you talk?"" the boy asked inquisitively. I answered a curt, ""yes,"" in reply.

""Next, do you have a name?"" in which I again tersely responded, ""Walter,"".

The feelings that were suppressed for however long came flooding out. I tried to stop it but I could still feel tears leaking out of my fiendish eyes. The boy asked me if I was all right, in which I laid every bit of information I knew upon him. My rejection from the army, my flight out here, the laborious months, Prodig-3, the cut, everything. He looked at me sympathetically, taking notes and absorbing information.

""Proverbs, 12:10"" are the only words that the boy said after everything

""What?' I answered, bewildered.

""Proverbs 12:10, Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast, but the mercy of the wicked is cruel. In god's eyes, you're no more an outcast than the football quarterback or a common housefly, and there will always be those that see it. You may never return to ""normal"", but you are as much of a person as anyone else in our care. You just need to learn to see that,"" the boy stated.

I looked at that kid, and I felt a sense of relief wash over me. The truck slowed to a stop, and I could only assume that we reached our destination. The boy went to exit the back but I hurriedly called out, ""Wait! What is your name?""

He turned back to me and replied, ""My name is Nick, but everyone here calls me Nightwalker.""

With that, he jumped out of the van and made his way towards some unseen destination.
I stepped out and gazed up at the night sky for the first time in what seemed like eons. I stared up at the heavens and asked for forgiveness for my rage earlier. I then turned around and walked towards the large white fortress.

I am the son of an army ranger.

I am the army's greatest mistake.

But I am not a monster, as there are no monsters in God's eyes.",1585693457.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsmsp4/im_the_son_of_an_army_ranger_im_also_the_armys/
fsq5gl,ThrowAwaytheCJ,Something explainable has been stalking the hiking trails near my house.,4,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsq5gl,0," 

It’s been ten days since my family and I have either been laid off (the case for me and my siblings) or forced to work from home (my parents’ case) from the Covid-19 pandemic. We live in a rural town near the Rocky Mountains, and two weeks ago we somehow had our first case despite being nearly in the middle of nowhere. My family has been surprisingly in good spirits, and my two dogs were more than happy to have our company 24/7.  For the first few days I didn’t mind, I got more opportunities to work on projects, and build my art and photography portfolios. 

On our sixth day, I noticed something strange in my area when I went to take a walk and take some photos. Our backyard juts into the foothills and onto hiking trails claimed by our town. I always use the trails for photos, either capturing the beautiful landscape shots my area provides, or, if i’m lucky, animal photos. The fence of my backyard is old and tall, at least seven feet (this will be of importance later). The gate creaks every time I open it, scaring off birds and rodents pretty much without fail. You can tell by the rustling of trees and bushes. 

What made it already feel like an off day, is that nothing made a sound when I opened the gate and it made that god awful noise. It just echoed into the wilderness, then absolute silence. Eerie, but didn’t think anything of it like a moron. I could hear every crunch of branches and leaves that I stepped on better than I ever could before. I wasn’t going to be long as it was getting late, and I had to go eat dinner soon. 

Another red flag was that I didn’t see a single soul on the path. It’s normally got a few people on it, and thanks to the virus bringing out the stupid in people, it usually had plenty of folks blocking the roads, not practicing social distancing or anything like that because it was “the countryside.” I didn’t think of this as anything bad, in fact I thought it was a blessing. I was jogging upwards, still only hearing me and me alone, to a lookout spot that is normally littered by tourists and hikers alike, seeing it was clear from below. 

I was somewhat out of breath upon reaching the lookout point, sucking in air with some light wheezing. I took in my view, the setting sun shone upon my town, and I didn’t need to worry about the sun getting in my shot. As I prepared my camera I heard a sound that still makes me shudder to this day. 

It was the sound of my gate opening up, off-tune, coming from a dip in the path on my right. I was no longer alone. Branches snapped as I heard what sounded like something shuffling around on the ground coming from the same area. I knew it was no echo. Whatever made that sound did it again, and my head snapped in the direction of the noise. I couldn’t make out much as it was rapidly getting darker, but I saw something hunched over on all fours, with bone-thin limbs thumping the ground around it. I decided that was enough, and ran all the way to my house. I heard the thumping sound in the distance, but not very close thankfully. I slammed my gate shut and caught my breath. I saw my family staring at me through the window, looking concerned. I bolted inside and locked the doors and covered the windows. My dogs went crazy, hair raised on both of them. I did my best to hush them, they knew something was wrong though- good dogs they are. 

I explained what I saw and what I heard to my family, but the only one who actually took it seriously was my older brother. He had always believed in cryptids. He gave me flak for not taking photos of the beast, but I was honestly too scared to at that moment. It was fight or flight instincts that took over me, and I wasn’t planning on fighting it with a camera. 

I got one of my dogs to sleep on my bed with me that night, to alert me if anything happens, as well as the standard emotional support. I got Seed, my pit bull. She’s normally docile and loves nothing more than to cuddle, but considering she went bonkers when I got home, I figured she’d be a perfect watchdog. My room is upstairs, and I cracked my window open to see if I could catch a glimpse. I had my doubts this creature could climb. My brother told me to call him on his cellphone if we saw anything, as he was going to be drinking and skyping his friends downstairs. I already had a hard time falling asleep early that night but I managed. It was short lived, however. 

At about 12:20 am, Seed started to growl.  

It was low, but it was enough to wake me up. I saw her head facing my window instead of me. She was sitting up. I gave her a kiss and hushed her, but she quickly went back to growling. Getting extremely nervous, I cocooned us in my blanket, and slowly crept towards my window. I didn’t initially see anything in the backyard. 

Yet, it didn’t take long before I heard something from outside. 

It was my wheezing from earlier, or at least an imitation of it. It was definitely louder than I was doing it up at the lookout point. I frantically scanned the yard, looking for the source of the sound. Seed was growling louder, which didn’t help the situation. I noticed something moving alongside the fence, on the other side of the property at the base of my window. All I could make out was something crawling, with bone-thin arms and legs. It was a brighter color, my guess it was grey. Hard to tell at night. 

I laid back on the bed, not wanting to be seen, and called my brother. He picked up immediately and I quickly explained to him what I’m seeing. Within a minute, he had hung up on his friends, shut down all the lights downstairs and was up in my room. I urged for him to crawl, so he wouldn’t be immediately spotted in the window. I could tell he was nervous too. After hushing the dog once more, my brother could make out the eerie sounds the thing outside was making. I had noticed a pungent smell starting to waft into the room, I suspected it was from this thing. Silently, my brother urged me to close my window, something I probably should’ve done sooner. 

I made an effort, but the cold night had caused the window to go stiff. It let out a squeak before it shut. Unfortunately, it was too loud.

Because the creature heard it. 

We watched as this thing stood upright. It was at least a foot taller than our fence. It was humanoid in shape, with wrinkly skin and mangy hair patches. It’s head looked like a human’s, but bald, with almost bat-like ears and a full mouth of jagged, crooked teeth. Its jaw was slacked, and a long tongue hanging out. It was drooling on the fence. It was fixated on my window. 

My brother and I hid back, both doing our best not to scream or cry. Seed began whimpering, thrashing as my brother muzzled her with his hands. I heard Rocket, our other dog, go crazy downstairs, barking at the back door and pawing at it. I was tempted to go down there and bring her up here when I heard the sound of wood creaking, and I frantically closed the curtains. I noticed it looked brighter outside suddenly, and I heard a familiar click sound like that of a flashlight turning on. I formed a peephole with the lower part of the curtain, against my brother’s decision and took a look outside. 

A motion light tripped, revealing this thing even better. Its eyes were black, with the glint of light reflecting from the motion lights- made them look like obsidian balls. Its torso had breached onto the top of the fence, with one arm touching the grass in our yard. Holy shit, the claws on it weren’t large, but were caked in dried blood and definitely sharp. It was no longer looking at us, but at the light. It covered its eyes and let out a shriek, that sounded halfway between a cougar scream, and a sheep's cry. It slunk back and I watched it crawl away into the bushes. 

I had a gut feeling it wouldn’t return that night, and thankfully it didn’t. I didn’t end up sleeping much at all that night. I made sure to spoil Seed for the next few days to make up for rudely having to muzzle her so much. I went out the next morning to look at where it was. The drool it left was there and smelt absolutely vile, like compost you’d forgotten to take out for several months mixed with expired milk. The fence looked like it was in stable condition at least.  

My brother wishes we had captured it on camera. It dawned on me that my father has one of those motion capture trail cams that people use to document wildlife. I’ll have to dig it up myself, as I’d doubt he’d let me use it for a purpose he didn’t believe in.  

There had been talk around the neighborhood yesterday of strange noises coming from the woods. Foolish hikers (that really should be staying home still) report hearing cougar cries and sheep cries to our local ranger. Whatever this thing is, it’s definitely getting more comfortable around these parts with everyone staying inside due to the Covid-19. 

I’ve been going out less and less on those trails, and I stopped going altogether during sunset. I don’t want to take any risks. I’ve been leaving lanterns out on our fence to deter this monster. I know it’s still out there though.

Last evening just after sunset, we all heard the off-tune creak of our gate echoing in the distance.",1585705477.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsq5gl/something_explainable_has_been_stalking_the/
fsg2bz,SpaceGeneralAmerica,The Windigo Graveyard - Part Two,114,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsg2bz,12,"[The morning came slowly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fqa9ei/the_windigo_graveyard/) I waited for Mike to wake up. I had been debating all night if I should tell him of my bizarre encounter. On the one hand, I was sure I hadn't been dreaming. What I'd seen and heard was real. But how could I explain a deer with a woman's face telling me to leave?

The Potawatomi legends filled my head, and I began to think this entire trip was a mistake. What we were getting ourselves into? A horror film? We had to do the smart thing and turn back, but how was I going to convince them?

I jumped when something tapped on my window. There was a man on the other side of the door, dressed in blue overalls, with a straw hat on and a crusty beard. He was a stereotypical redneck who looked like he'd just stepped out of a film making fun of country folk.

""You alright?"" he said, revealing he lacked a country accent. He was giving me a stink eye, then looked over me and into the backseat. He didn't even wait for my answer before he spoke again. ""What about your friends there?"" Without missing a beat, he began rapping his knuckles against the window furiously.

""The fuck?"" Derek groaned. Louis's groggy protests for five more minutes were mixed in with the man's rapid tapping.

""Wake up!"" the man barked. ""Wake up, ya fucking idiots!""

My friends began to shout and swear, shocked awake by the man outside. He kept shouting at us, demanding we wake up.

""What the fuck is going on?"" Mike said, blinking furiously and digging out crusty yellow gunk from his eyes. He glared over me at the man on the other side of the window.

The man pointed his finger downward. ""We can hear you just fine,"" I said timidly.

""Don't care,"" he said, ""open the window.""

I sighed and used the crank to do just that. The man stuck his head in once it was halfway open. ""Now, mind tell me why you're so close to the Graveyard?""

I glanced over at Mike then the twins in the back. Mike was the one to answer. ""You mean the Windigo Graveyard?""

""You're planning on going into it,"" the man sighed, then scowled at us. ""Look, I'm only going to say this once. Turn around and don't come back. Don't go into that godforsaken place. There's a reason it's called-""

""We know about the legends,"" Mike interrupted, ""do you seriously put stock in that?""

The man's face fell instantly. It was so abrupt I couldn't help but feel my unease stir. The man scratched at his face, shaking his head.

""So you know what happened there? What became of the Windigos?""

""There's no such thing as Windigos,"" Mike said, annoyed.

""Have you ever seen a Windigo?"" the man asked. It almost sounded like a joke, but he was completely serious.

The twins laughed, clearly amused. The man glared at them, then Mike spoke up again.

""Okay, sir, this is ridiculous. My friends and I are-""

""Going camping in there?"" the man asked, eyebrow raised. Then he slowly nodded, like he already knew the answer. ""Just tell me this; have any of you seen the Deer Woman?""

A lump formed in my throat as last night's events raced through my mind. I could still hear her voice.

""The what?"" Louis asked.

""The Deer Woman,"" the man said again, ""she's an ancient spirit. Can take the form of either a deer or a woman. Sometimes she'll fuck you, sometimes she'll kill you, sometimes both. But sometimes..."" the man gave me a lingering glare. He'd seen the way the color had drained from my face. ""She'll leave you a warning. And she always does it around the Graveyard."" The man looked up the road, in the direction we were going.

""Why are you telling us this?"" Derek asked. I could hear the smile in his voice.

The man sighed, running his hand underneath his straw hat. ""Cause I don't want you boys to die. You know only five people have been dumb enough to go into those hills? You know what's in there? Evil. Pure evil. Evil so dark, so far from God's light, it can kill a man just by looking at him.""

""Have you seen this evil?"" Mike asked an eyebrow raised.

""I thank God I haven't,"" the man replied grimly. ""But if you do... then there's no hope for you."" The man paused, then resumed speaking.

""Are you sure about going into the Graveyard?""

""Absolutely,"" Mike replied.

""Then take my advice,"" the man said solemnly, ""you won't find any trails in there, but you may find the old village. Some say it's still standing. Waiting. If you do find it, stay away. I'm sure every single person who's ever gone into that place has found it. And I expect you boys will as well. So please, just stay away from that village.""

""And one other thing,"" the man continued, ""you're gonna want to stay together. If you see something out of the corner of your eye, ignore it. Okay? Just ignore it?""

""What are you, some kind of NPC guide?"" Derek said, then he, his brother, and Mike all laughed. I snickered as well. It was just too sudden and abrupt a joke not to.

""No, you Fortnite gaming noob,"" the man said, shutting us all up. We stared at him in confusion as he smirked grimly at us. ""My brothers and I went into that place once, when we were young and stupid. Like you. We all made it out somehow. But we've never gone back. Wanna know why?"" The man took a deep breath before he answered. ""Because the evil in that place nearly got us. Nearly.""

""How'd you escape?"" I asked, and the man turned to me, with what looked like pity in his eyes.

""We stuck together,"" he replied, ""didn't get too lost. Didn't let its tricks fool us. Didn't risk staying past the second day."" The man pushed himself away from the car and sighed.

""What can we expect to find?"" I asked immediately, leaning forward. ""Like, ghosts, spirits, that kind of thing.""

The man gave me a hard look before shaking his head. ""You'll find something in there,"" he answered, ""something that was around long before God made this universe we live in. I'm not sure what you'll find, because my brothers and I didn't encounter much in there. But just remember, that I warned you. Anything that happens while in the Graveyard is on your heads. Not mine.""

And with that, he turned around and walked away. We watched him as he got into a truck a few feet away, reversed and did a U-Turn, driving off back down the road.

""Did you call us noobs?""

""Fortnite gaming noobs,"" Louis said to his brother, ""I don't think I've ever heard anyone use that insult before.""

""I've got to try it one day,"" Derek said, then he and his brother snickered.

I looked over at Mike. He looked back. I could see it in his eyes. He was shaken.

Then he gripped the steering wheel. ""Alright, shut up,"" he said firmly, ""buckle up, and get ready. We're going to resume driving now.""

The rest of the short drive to the Graveyard was uneventful. The twins kept joking with each other in the backseat. I kept my eyes on the road, apprehension building with every passing second.

I could feel us getting closer to the Graveyard. Like the ticking hands of a clock, I could almost hear it getting closer. Tick, tick, tick... when the clock chimes, what will happen?

As we crested a hill and drove down it, I caught sight of the hills in the distance, covered in trees.

And I felt my apprehension explode into pure dread and loathing.

""Guys,"" I said softly, ""we're here.""

Derek and Louis's laughter slowly petered off then stopped. I heard Mike inhale sharply. His knuckles were turning white as he tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

The Windigo Graveyard was sitting there like it was waiting for us. The trees swayed gently in the wind, excited. The hills sat immobile, patiently watching us drive closer. They were perfect in almost every way, beautiful in how untouched they were. Too perfect. I didn't dare look away. I felt like I was looking at a thing, not the trees and hills of Michigan. Have you ever heard of the uncanny valley? How the human brain can sense when something is pretending to be human? Looking at the Windigo Graveyard, I felt like I was looking at something pretending - not pretending to be a forest, not pretending to be the hills, not the sky above it either.

I felt like it was pretending to be from our world.

The road veered sharply away when we reached the bottom, like it too knew whatever was there was no natural landmark or should event exist. Mike took it gently and pulled to the side. None of us had taken our eyes off the Windigo Graveyard.

""We're sure this is the place?"" Derek asked.

""Yeah,"" Mike replied, ""yeah, this matches the pictures.""

That was all any of us said for the next ten minutes. We stayed in complete silence, watching the Graveyard, knowing something was dreadfully wrong with it, something so unnatural and inhuman the primitive, reptilian part of our brains that had been there since our ancestors crawled from the sea screamed at us to turn around and run back to Chicago. Never to return.

""It's too quiet,"" Derek said suddenly, making me jump. I saw Mike do the same before he regained his composure and turned to face him.

""What?"" Mike said, not as a question. He said it as if Derek had just revealed the most awful secret in the world.

""I can't hear any birds,"" Derek continued, ""or even a stream or the wind. I can't hear anything."" Derek hadn't taken his eyes off the Graveyard.

""Maybe we should turn back,"" I said slowly.

Mike sighed, rubbing his hands together. He cupped them underneath his chin, thinking. Every now and then, he'd glance at the Graveyard.

""Guys,"" he said slowly, ""let's stay here at least one night, okay? It can't be that bad, can it? We've been in more dangerous places than this. We've been caving, scuba diving, rock climbing, this should be easy compared to that. And besides, we came all this way. Might as well see if this place is as awful as the locals say it is.""

I wanted to answer that we already knew it was. We just had to look at it to know. This place wasn't part of Mother Nature's domain. Something had taken it from her. I was sure of it. And besides that, the Deer Woman's warning echoed in my head.

Before I could say anything, Louis spoke up. ""I agree,"" he said slowly, ""let's just spend a little while here, and if things get rough, we can leave, okay?""

""Yeah,"" Derek said then, nodding slowly, ""yeah, just for a little while. I'm sure we'll be fine it stay here for just one night, then go back. Let's do that?""

Then my friends turned to me. ""Noah,"" Mike said, ""what do you think?""

I wanted to say that we needed to leave now and never come back. I did. But I didn't have the strength to do it.

""Let's just... stay for the night,"" I replied. Looking back at this moment, I wish I hadn't said that. I wish I'd trusted my gut and screamed at my friends to leave, forcing us to go back to Chicago. I wish I'd done anything but say we should stay for the night. I wish I could have.

But I didn't.

And because of that, my friends and I ended up in the Windigo Graveyard.",1585672247.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsg2bz/the_windigo_graveyard_part_two/
fsht8z,EaPAtbp,There's something wrong with Mr. Scoopy's ice cream,54,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsht8z,12,"“Get back inside you idiots!”

Even with the windows and doors closed, I could still hear Mrs. Warshaw screaming from her kitchen window. The only other sound in the neighborhood was the sound of the ice cream truck that had been parked at the end of the street for the last hour or so.

I had heard this chiming version of Greensleeves play on a loop at least a few dozen times now, although it had only taken about three minutes before it got unbearably annoying.

I normally would never be on the same page as Mrs. Warshaw, but I couldn’t help but agree with her anger this time.

I got up from the couch and walked over to the window, pulling back the curtains to look outside. Mrs. Warshaw was leaning out her kitchen window, looking down the road. I pressed my forehead against the glass to get a better view, but all I could see was a small crowd of people.

“What’s going on?”

I looked over as my fiance Marco walked into the room behind me.

“There’s an ice cream truck out there.” I said.

He leaned over me to take a look out the window.

“Are people crowding around it?” He asked.

“Looks like it.”

“I don’t think that’s a good idea right now.” He said, backing away and taking a seat on the couch as he turned the television on.

I kept looking out the window as Greensleeves continued to play.

“You’re all going to die!” Mrs. Warshaw shouted.

She glanced over towards our house and stared at me for a second, before looking back towards the growing crowd of people at the end of the street.

Finally, I backed up from the window. If people were going to be stupid, that was on them.

I joined Marco on the couch as he scrolled through some movies on Netflix, not really paying any attention.

He began to hum softly and I sat there, listening until I noticed he was humming Greensleeves.

“Really?”

“Sorry, it’s catchy. It’s been playing for a while now. I guess it’s stuck in my head.” He replied.

The music was distracting and unnecessarily loud. It almost sounded like it was getting louder each time it looped. I could hear the lyrics to the song in my head each time it played, over and over again. I hated this song.

“Hello? Earth to Chris?”

Marco waved his hand in front of my face.

“What?”

“Are you okay? You blanked for a second there.”

I looked over at the TV.

“When did you put on a movie?” I asked.

“Like, fifteen minutes ago.”

I shook my head.

“Sorry, the music is so distracting. Why is the ice cream truck still out there?”

I got up and opened the front door, stepping out into the porch and then walking out to the front lawn. I heard Marco’s footsteps as he followed me out.

I stopped at the edge of our lawn and looked towards the ice cream truck that was surrounded by the neighborhood kids and their parents.

The truck itself looked old, and the white paint was chipping and dirty. It read [“Mr. Scoopy’s Ice Cream”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fshx3c/theres_an_empty_ice_cream_truck_at_the_end_of_the/) in big red letters on the side, and included a giant vanilla ice cream cone as a mascot. It had big eyes and a wide-open mouth and it was eating a smaller vanilla ice cream cone that had a frightened look on its face.

“That’s a bit morbid.” Marco mumbled.

I stared at the cartoon for a few seconds. He was right; it was a bit unsettling for an ice cream truck.

“How long does it take to get some damn ice cream?”

It seemed like everyone was trying to shove their way to the front of the crowd, and I noticed that some people already had ice cream, but they weren’t going back inside; they were trying to get more of it.

“Oh don’t tell me you’re going to get ice cream too?”

I looked over at Mrs. Warshaw, who had all but climbed out her window at this point.

“We’re just looking.” I said.

She huffed, loud enough that I could hear.

After a few minutes of standing out there, my head started to hurt from the awful twinkling music. I turned around to make my way back inside as Marco followed. Just as we were about to walk up the porch steps, a high pitched child’s scream filled the neighborhood.

We ran back towards the sidewalk to get a look at what was happening. A child had dropped their ice cream cone and it was now splattered on the road. The child continued to scream, not even stopping to take a breath, as she reached for her blond pigtails, first pulling the red ribbons off and then gripping her hair in her hands and pulling as she continued to scream.

Her face turned bright red as her mom walked over and tried to get her hands off her hair. It was no use, however, and the girl kept screaming until she pulled out two giant chunks of hair and dropped them on the floor, on top of her ice cream.

She stopped screaming, but only for a second before she started up again, and charged at another girl, grabbing her ice cream cone and throwing it off to the side, where it landed on the nearest lawn.

The second girl started to cry, and ran towards the ice cream, licking it off the grass.

Off to the side, the girl’s mothers had started fighting with one another. In the midst of all this, the rest of the people were still trying to get their ice cream, completely oblivious to the fighting that was happening around them.

Soon enough, it seemed like everyone was fighting with one another. The ice cream was being thrown across the street and at other people as multiple fights broke out among the neighbors.

Some people were kneeling on the floor, licking ice cream up from off the road, sidewalk, and the nearby lawns.

We watched from our front lawn as people continued to fight. It was escalating by the second, and I watched as one kid bit another’s arm, causing the second kid to scream. The first kid didn’t let go, even as the second began punching him in the face over and over.

I reached over and tapped Marco.

“Call the police.”

He ran back inside immediately and I stood there, frozen as my neighbors continued to brutally attack one another. People were punching, kicking, and biting each other. It even looked like some were biting off chunks of other people’s skin. I was sure that by now. a few people had some broken bones.

“They’re on their way. Holy shit.”

I glanced over at Marco as he watched the crowd of people who were almost killing each other over ice cream. As all of this unfolded, the stupid song kept chiming on in the background, almost loud enough to drown the yelling and screaming.

Suddenly, the ice cream truck began to move, making its way down the street, towards us, and running over someone’s leg as it passed. The music got louder, causing a pounding in my head as it rolled past us.

I stared into the ice cream truck, trying to get a look at the driver, although I wasn’t able to really see much of them. They were wearing a red hoodie over a black baseball cap, hiding most of their face, and all I could see was one thin, frail-looking hand as it gripped the steering wheel. We watched the ice cream truck drive off down the street, the music slowly getting quieter and quieter, but never really fading completely.

The truck turned left when it got to the end of the street and once it was out of sight, I looked back towards the crowd of people.

A few seemed to be dead on the road now. And I noticed that some of the people had begun to take notice of Marco and me, pointing towards us.

“We should go inside.” I grabbed Marco’s arm and we ran into the house, locking the door.

As the crowd reached our house, they began banging on the windows and doors erratically.

“What the hell was in that ice cream?” I shouted over the noise.

Marco shook his head as he leaned against the front door. The pounding on the door and windows was making the walls shake around us.

Suddenly, the sound of police sirens could be heard getting closer. I sighed in relief. The sirens got louder and closer, making me feel a bit safer, although not completely.

For some reason, it still wasn’t loud enough to drown out Greensleeves as it played in the distance.",1585677798.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsht8z/theres_something_wrong_with_mr_scoopys_ice_cream/
fsq18h,i_amtheice,My friends and I tried to make a short film at this old abandoned ROTC camp last summer and a bunch of weird shit happened,3,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsq18h,1,"The drive out to the camp took longer than anticipated. It should’ve been my first clue everything was going to suck. There was no real reason for the delay, it just happened because we're all average people in our twenties and no one wants to be responsible so everyone showed up at my place when they felt like it, sending half-assed texts of apology. We were like an hour off schedule before we even got started.

Franz drove me, him and Natalie. Noisehead was behind us in his truck with the other guys.

It was me, Franz, Natalie, Joe, Noisehead (I've never learned his real name, I don't know him that well) and Rian. We all knew each other through school and through each other. 

I was directing this particular project. Franz usually directed but he was here as camera today. Joe was my DP, a dependable guy. Noisehead was general crew and the lead actor. Natalie was the female lead. Rian was a spare actor/crew. Everyone was getting paid in beer and food once it was over.

Natalie and Franz had had a fight before we all met at their place. I don’t know what the fight was about  but they barely talked the whole way out there. I didn't care since me and Natalie never really got along. Franz convinced her to do this anyway. I appreciated it. 

I had written the script a burst of creativity a few nights previous. I thought it was fucking brilliant but it was probably mediocre like everything else I do. It was about a guy who comes back from war to find his wife in bed with another man. So original and exciting.

The script came out in one of those glorious orgasms of creativity, the idea surfacing after seeing a Vox article on military wives. I banged it out in like an hour and was sure I was finally going to be recognized for my genius, go viral, make a name, all that shit.

I called Franz and told him about it the next day. He was enthusiastic until I said I wanted to direct. I brought up Joe, who I've known casually for a few years. Joe had mentioned this abandoned Army camp out off Marshall Road. I can't remember the context, but he'd mentioned it.

“No one goes out there,” I told Franz. “It’d be perfect for this.”

""Sure, bud,"" said Franz. ""Let me know the dates.""

Franz has not followed through on a lot of his promises before. I've known him for years and he keeps saying he'll do shit and talking about it but never actually following through on anything. I was fed up with him for the most part and I didn’t want to ask him to do this at first. But I was high on dopamine since I'd finished something myself and he’s my friend so I figured I’d give him one last chance. Plus, literally no one else I know has the equipment I need. Even Joe uses the equipment from the Quicken video department to his projects.

The drive took about half an hour, out 96 west and down a few dirt roads, deep in the woods in suburban Michigan.

The camp reminded me of any old fifth grade camp that you'd see in teen movies. There was a row of old cabins and a mess hall and these weird wooden poles with ropes hanging off them. I couldn’t tell if they were flagpoles or what-- they were too short and thick to be flagpoles. The whole place was smaller than I'd imagined, too, but that was perfect. Only a few acres tops, a little community carved into the woods. The buildings looked like they'd been built in the 70s. Joe said the place was abandoned in the 2000s.

We got in and unloaded the filming equipment, setting up home base in the mess hall, which was this long low building on the northern end of the complex. The only furniture in the mess hall were these wooden picnic tables that had clearly been meant for outside use.

The cabins were these little wooden huts, all set in a row down the main drag with those weird flagpole-things hanging. They looked like outhouses, almost. The place was creepy, but so's every place in the middle of nowhere you're not supposed to be at. The doors to every building were unlocked.

I started looking around. We'd do most of the shooting in the mess hall, some in the first cabin, and some outside. We'd shoot into the night. If someone came along and kicked us off, our only plan was to beg forgiveness. Joe said we probably wouldn't have anything to worry about. I didn't see any cameras anywhere, and who the fuck would run power out to a place like this anyway.

When everything was unloaded, I took stock of what we had while everyone else mingled and milled about.

Right away, the confusion started. 

Everyone seemed more interested in exploring the place than getting anything set up. I couldn’t remember what shot I wanted to do first. I've never been much of a go-getter or a natural leader, but I wanted my brilliant script executed in my way. I didn't want to argue with anyone. I sat in the mess hall and looked at my printed script over and over.

I suddenly had a terrible revelation, sitting there on the splintery picnic table. The script sucked. It was fucking shit. I was embarrassed of it. I couldn't shoot any of this bullshit. I had to hide it.

I decided to just be quiet and hopefully no one would notice me.

Franz sat at the picnic table where all the batteries had been unloaded. There was no power to the place, so we'd have to make good use of our batteries. The cars could charge them if we had to, but we didn't want to run too much of a risk draining our car batteries and getting stranded. Cell phone service wasn't great out here anyway-- mine was stuck on 1x the whole time.

Franz just took a seat and stared into the distance. Like I said, he and Natalie had been irritated-quiet with each other the whole way up here. I rode in the back like I was their kid or something.

Natalie sat down across from Franz with her back to him. She pulled out her mirror and did her makeup obsessively. She’d been working on it the whole way here, using the visor mirror.

Half an hour went by and nothing was getting done. I was frustrated but couldn’t do anything about it. My script was terrible. I kept trying to edit it but nothing worked.

Noisehead came up to me. He and the other guys had been exploring and hanging out by the cars. I was pretty sure they'd smoked at some point, too.

“I thought we were going to have a plan here,"" Noisehead said.

“You’re preaching to the choir,"" I told him, trying to hide the shitty script.

“But you’re the director, right?”

“…yeah.”

Noisehead snorted and shook his head and walked off in disgust without another word. I felt humiliated but I was too focused on the shitty script to care.

I heard him talking to Joe a few seconds later, just outside the door.

“You mind if I take charge here?” he asked.

“Not at all.”

“Let’s find out where the fuck we are with this and see if — “

“Let’s just bail, dude.” 

""What?""

""This place is giving me the fucking creeps. Let's just bail.""

I heard Rian speak up.

""Let's go look around at least a little. We drove all the fuck the way out here.""

The three of them disappeared around the side of the building. I decided I hated them.

I moved over and sat with Franz at the other table. I wanted to sit and just take stock of the situation. Something was wrong and I couldn't place it. I wanted to get started but I had such a terrible script. Why the fuck hadn't I noticed this before?

I stared at the pages of my script, the courier font, the bold and italic. There was no saving it. I almost teared up I was so mad at myself.  And I'd dragged everyone out here. How humiliating. My life was just one big attempt at popularity followed by inevitable humiliation due to my own incompetence.

""Do either of you feel... out of it?"" Franz asked suddenly.

Natalie didn't answer, continuing to do her make-up. But for the first time I noticed that yes, I did have this weird Nyquil feeling about me.

""Yeah,"" I said. ""I do feel a little... medicated.""

""Medicated is the right word,"" said Franz.

He went back to staring off into the distance, out the windows at the other end of the mess hall.

""Joe and Rian are going to take a look around,"" said Noisehead, coming inside.

""Where are they going?"" I asked.

Noisehead ignored me.

""I don't know what the plan here is,"" he said to Franz. Franz didn't answer him, so he came over and started fiddling with the batteries, taking them off the chargers and putting them back on. I watched him. He was really pissing me off but I was too much of a pussy to say anything. Franz stared out the windows and Natalie kept looking into her mirror and doing her mascara.

""FUCK,"" I heard her murmur.

“Aren’t we going to have a plan?” Noisehead asked again, clicking another battery onto a charger. ""I was told there'd be a plan.""

My fucking script. It was in my sweaty hands. The pages crinkled. It was fucking terrible, every line exposing me as a hack, talentless, worthless. That was supposed to be the plan but the plan was the worst thing that had ever been put on paper.

*I should just fucking die right here,* I suddenly thought.

Then we heard a voice from outside.

“Hello?”

The four of us turned and saw her.

It was a woman, this little old woman standing in the grass out in front of the mess hall, between the cars and the door. She was wearing an old dress, like a weird Amish prairie thing. She had a toothless little puckered mouth and twinkling eyes. Her hair was hidden under a blue bonnet.

“Who are you?” she asked us through the open mess hall door.

Noisehead went out to speak with her. I could hear him explaining. I caught questions like, “Well, who’s permission did you get?”

I absent-mindedly looked down the other way out the windows at the opposite end of the mess hall, toward where Franz was looking.

My balls shriveled.

There was a man standing in the trees, silently. Over by one of the cabins, behind it. Just inside the treeline.

He was staring right at me. He was older, too. About the age of the woman. An old Farmer John type, ancient and rusted and skinny and wiry. He wore a black tuxedo and his white hair was slicked back. He looked like a preacher or something.

In his hands he cradled some sort of black pitchfork. Four prongs, serrated and barbed.

Shock blew through my mind. A singular thought. 

*We shouldn’t be here.* 

I went over to the door, keeping my eyes on the pitchfork man. The guy’s eyes were hollow. He watched me, no expression. Franz stared like he was hypnotized.

“Noisehead,” I called. “Get back in here.” 

""I'm figuring out a plan here,"" Noisehead snapped.

""Just come inside, Noisehead,"" I said.

The pitchfork man hadn't moved.

Noisehead excused himself to the bonnet lady and came back in.

“You might want to be careful,” she called after him. “I think this place is haunted.” 

""What is it?"" said Noisehead peevishly.

""There's a guy over there,"" I said. ""He's got a pitchfork.""

I pointed out the windows.

The guy was gone.

“Where’s Rian and Joe?” Franz asked. He was slurring his words.

“They went exploring,"" said Noisehead. ""To look for... to look for the plan.""

""Look,"" I said, pointing out the door.

The woman in the bonnet was gone, too.

""Where'd she go?"" Noisehead asked as if it was my fault. ""She couldn't have just walked off.""

He stuck his head out the mess hall door.

""Hello?""

I sat back down at the battery table, my sweat-soaked script in my hands. I wanted to leave but we didn’t. I wanted to get the fuck out of there. 

“I haven’t been able to jerk it in like weeks,” I said randomly. “Not even to porn.” 

“We haven’t had sex in six months,” said Natalie, still focusing on her one eyelash with her mascara.

""What's the fucking plan here?"" Noisehead screamed.

“This is all your fault,” I snapped at Franz. “You had that shot. It would’ve been you. You didn’t take it. Cause you’re a pussy.”

“Yeah…” said Franz, sounding bored, still looking out the window where the pitchfork man had stood.

I fiddled with the pages of my script, crinkling them. Noisehead just kept playing with the batteries and muttering about the plan while Natalie fiddled with her eyeliner and muttered, ""FUCK,"" over and over.

“You’re the pussy,” Franz said quietly in that tranced out way. “*You*’*re* the pussy.”

Suddenly, Joe and Rian tore around the side of the mess hall and burst through the door.

""THERE'S A FUCKING CEMETERY OUT THERE,"" Joe exclaimed. ""AND A BUNCH OF THE GRAVES ARE FUCKING OPEN.""

""You're the pussy,"" said Franz again, sounding like he was about to fall asleep.

I looked down at my godawful hack script.

Without another thought I tore it to shreds, scattered it all over.

“You’re right,” I said over and over. “You’re right.” 

""Who's right?"" Joe asked.

""WE HAVE GOT TO FUCKING GO,"" Rian said, actually dancing in place he was so freaked out. ""This place freaked me the fuck out the second we rolled up!""

“Dude,” Joe said, coming over to me and grabbing my shoulders. “What are we doing?” 

""I DON'T KNOW,"" I told him.

""He said there'd be a plan,"" Noisehead yelled. ""He said there'd be a plan but there isn't one!""

""Dude, they're fucking tripping out,"" Rian said.

""No shit,"" said Joe.

""My script was terrible,"" I told Joe, almost crying. ""I'm so sorry for wasting everyone's time. I deserve to die.""

""Dude, what?""

""I deserve to die. I'm a terrible person and I'll never be successful.""

""Dude, we have to get out of here,"" said Joe. ""Rian and I found a bunch of open graves in the back. Like, freshly open graves.""

""WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ?"" Noisehead screamed at Franz. ""STOP LOOKING AT IT.""

“I'm watching the ritual happen,” said Franz, matter-of-factly. ""You're the pussy.""

""Dude, you have to wake up,"" Joe said, looking me directly in the eye. ""You guys are tripping out.""

""I am awake,"" I insisted, but Joe was right-- I felt like I was swimming in a dream or something.

Joe didn't wait for us. He and Rian hastily started grabbing all the film crap and taking it back outside and throwing it in the bed of Joe's pickup. Noisehead helped them, babbling about the plan.

""Yeah, man, the plan is get the fuck out of here,"" I heard Joe tell him. ""That's the plan.""

""As long as that's the plan,"" Noisehead said over and over. ""I was told there'd be a *fucking* plan.""

For some reason I felt really hot. I wanted to sit down again.

""You're the pussy,"" Franz muttered.

Natalie was still fucking with her make-up. Her eyes were as black as a raccoon's (see, I can't even come up with original metaphors when I'm of sound mind), caked with mascara.

Joe grabbed her and Franz by the arm and towed them outside.

""Come on, dude,"" he said to me. I followed.

As soon as I set foot on the grass I snapped out of whatever daze I'd been in.

""Holy fuck,"" I said. ""What is wrong with me?""

I thought of the man with the pitchfork and almost had a panic attack.

""Are you sane again?"" Joe asked. ""We're loaded up.""

""I don't know what just happened,"" I said.

""Can you fucking drive? Franz is out of it.""

""I can drive,"" I said, not completely sure but I wanted out of there.

""Dude, it feels like we're being watched,"" said Rian, already in the pickup.

""Where are we?"" Natalie asked. ""And why's my left eye got like a million tons of mascara on it?""

We tore the fuck out of there, kicking dust up. Joe led the way. I didn't look back. We all felt better by the time we got on the highway.

""Dude,"" I said. ""What the fuck just happened?""

""That place was haunted,"" said Franz. ""Duh.""

""Who was that guy with the pitchfork?""

""I'm not saying it out loud.""

Then just a few weeks ago Joe Snapchatted me and sure enough there was some weird evil spiritual fuckery afoot.

""Dude,"" he said. ""I found out what's going on. I looked up all these articles and I read that camp was built on an old town. They said witchcraft was performed there-- people in surrounding communities would hear weird parties and see weird lights on certain nights of the year. People stopped going through there because they said that the devil was using the town as a portal. Then when the railroad was built it bypassed the town and it just kind of dried up over the years.""

""Then what's with the army camp, though?""

""It wasn't the army,"" said Joe. ""It was like this old ROTC program out of OCC. They used it from the 60's until the 2000s, but only in the summer. And no one would ever stay there at night. It was such a pain in the ass they used it less and less until they just stopped going. That's how I first heard of it-- my uncle went there when he was a teenager. He said guys would dare each other to go out to the cemetery every morning when they got there. No one would do it.""

So yeah, not a surprise.

Finally, something was happening. The start of day three had been rather uneventful. After receiving their items, the participants stopped interacting with each other for the most part. Except for Dale and Allie who actually both chose an old-school Gameboy and were now sitting on the same bed playing. Allie seemed to have gotten over the fact that Dale didn’t seem to remember her but it looked as if they were building up some sort of friendship. Derek asked for a tennis ball and was throwing it against the wall much to the annoyance of Ashlee who had asked for painting materials and was sitting on the table drawing. I tried to zoom in and what I recognized looked like very detailed bodies of humans, all missing their heads. Not because she hadn’t added them, it looked as if they had been ripped off the drawn heads. Yikes. Dimitri chose an old mp3 player and was listening to music with his eyes closed. Andy had a notepad in which he was writing down things. 

After vigorously scribbling down things all morning, Andy had gotten up, as if he had just gotten an idea.

**How may I help you?**

I asked through the intercom.

“Social is Group 2 always getting the same questions as us?”

**Sometimes.**

“Do they get to make more decisions than us?”

**Possibly**.

“Social can you not be so fucking vague, please.”

**Sorry, I did not understand that question.**

He sat back down and started writing again.

“What was that about?” Ashlee asked.

Andy looked up from his notepad.

“Well, so far the experiment seems to be too arbitrary. There are too many factors not really making sense. What if the reason for that is Group 2 making decisions for us that we are not aware of?”

“That would be interesting. Actually I am starting to get pretty fed up with that other group,” she responded.

“Yeah me too,” Andy mumbled. 

“Well to be fair, we did break the finger of one of them,” Allie said.

“We didn’t. Derek did.” Andy said.

“He did it because we wanted it to happen. That’s the point, right? We are one group.”

“Thank you, Dimitri.” Derek chimed in. 

It was interesting to notice that Dimitri had evolved much more of a group feeling. Of course it could just be an act. 

&#x200B;

**Good afternoon Group 1. We have a special round planned for today. You have spent three days in the same room. Do you feel like you have gotten to know the people around you better? I sure hope so as your knowledge will be tested in the next round. If you get more right answers than Group 2, special prices and privileges are awaiting you. Are you ready?**

“Hell yeah!” Derek shouted. “This finally sounds like something fun.”

“Yeah I very much doubt that it will be that easy,” Dale mumbled. 

**Alright, participants. Please each sit down on one of the beds, facing the door. We will activate the front camera now. In the following I will be reading a number of statements describing one of you and you will have to show whether you know who I’m talking about. You won’t have time to discuss it.** 

**Statement one: This participant almost died trying to save a sibling. Raise your left hand if you think this is Derek. Raise your right hand if you think this is Allie.**

Everyone but one raised their hand for Allie. Everyone but Allie herself.

**The majority chose right. You gained one point.**

“What the hell. I don’t have any siblings” Allie said. 

**Statement two:** **This participant poisoned both their parents. Raise your left hand for Ashlee. Raise your right hand for Dale.**

The majority chose for Ashlee. 

**The majority chose wrong. You lose one point.** 

Ashlee let out a sharp laugh. “Guess the quiet ones tend to be the ones with secrets, huh?”

Dale didn’t respond but he was clenching his fists tight.

**Statement three: This participant spent days watching the private lives of people through cameras in their eyes and homes. Raise your right hand for Andy. Raise your left hand for Derek.**

The majority chose Andy. Except for Andy who raised his left hand.

**This was a trick question. Both answers are correct. You gain two points.** 

There was a strange silence filling the room now.

**Statement four: This participant tried to commit murder. Raise your right hand for Allie. Raise your left hand for Dimitri.** 

Everyone chose for Dimitri. With the exception of Allie. 

**The majority chose wrong. You lose one point.** 

“Come on, holding a piece of mirror to his throat shouldn’t count as murder,” Andy said.

“They are talking about a different time,” Allie whispered.

**Statement five: This participant kidnapped and hit a number of children. Raise your right hand for Dale. Raise your left hand for Dimitri.** 

Dimitri and Dale raised their left hand. The rest of the group chose for Dimitri. 

**The majority chose wrong. You lose one point.** 

“Okay this one is wrong. I know for a fact that this has to be Dimitri.” Ashlee exclaimed.

“I never physically hurt any of them.”

“Depends on your definitions of pain” she responded with a bitter undertone. 

&#x200B;

\---

“I mean we most definitely lost, why is Social not saying anything?” Andy asked the room.

“Maybe the other group hasn’t played yet,” Allie responded.

The group was now sitting around the table. 

“Were the things Social said true? Dale, did you hurt children?”

Dale stayed silent. 

“If you did, then fuck you. Although it also said that I saved a sibling which can’t be true.” Allie spoke.

“What about the other thing?”

She closed her eyes for a moment. 

“Yes. I didn’t kill anyone but I tried.” She took a deep breath. “[Let’s just say my childhood wasn’t particularly easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe0yvl/we_called_him_the_wizard/)… or normal. For years my parents sent me to a boarding school where I repeatedly got tortured and molested. And the worst part is that my parents denied all of it. Once, when I was almost 18, I tried to hurt the people who were hurting me. But I failed.”

She was clearly trying to hold back tears.

“I’m so sorry. Allie. I can’t begin to imagine what you went through. I didn’t mean to ask so bluntly. That was shitty of me.” Andy said.

She responded with an understanding smile and gained a few compassionate looks from other participants. Ashlee even held her hand. 

Dale didn't look at her though. Instead he stared into the distance as he was shaking nervously. 

“The parent thing was right, the other one was a lie. But I swear they deserved it” he finally said. 

“The one about me was right too. As some of you know, I was a researcher and I helped with a highly questionable study. Similar to this screwed up scenario. Except they added the wonderful factor of random people watching me as they would vote on whether I deserved to survive or not.” he glared at Derek as he spoke that last sentence. Then, in a more joking tone he added “I guess this study is both my punishment and my relief.”

“Shall we conclude that all of us have done some questionable things in life?” Dimitri said.

“Some worse than others though,” Derek responded. 

“I don’t know. Some of the statements could still be lies and honestly at this point I trust you guys more than I trust Social.” Ashlee added. 

Luckily I did my research and know who is telling the truth and who isn’t.

**Good evening Group 1. You lost today’s game against Group 2. They were provided with the same choice as you were yesterday. The roles of Victim and Punisher were reversed meaning the following: Derek you will be guided to the room again in a moment. Group 2 decided for ten minutes with you in which they can do whatever they want. You may prepare yourself for what will come.** 

“No, no, no. She will kill me. You should have seen the look on her face yesterday. You guys can’t send me there.” Derek jumped up from his chair and restlessly walked around the room.

“I have an idea,” Ashlee said and walked up to get something underneath her bed.

She handed Derek a piece of the broken mirror.

“Social said to prepare and there will be nobody watching.” 

“You already broke her finger, you can’t do this, Derek. She’ll probably just break something of yours as well. Without a weapon she probably won’t get far.” Andy said.

“But what if you were right earlier? What if the other Group is getting different choices. This is about survival and whatever happens, our group needs to survive. We are in this together guys, remember that. Do whatever you have to, Derek. We stand behind you” Dimitri spoke. 

“Exactly. Look you don’t have to hurt her if she doesn’t do anything dumb. But in case you need to protect yourself, you can.” Ashlee added.

Derek looked around the room where everyone seemed to be nodding in agreement.

“Alright then.”

&#x200B;

\----

“Fuck, fuck, fuck.”

Derek walked back into the room, his clothes soaked with blood. 

I turned on the tv we had installed in the room. The participants were not able to turn it on or off, only I was. Before Derek could say anything, I played the video of what had happened.

You could see a girl with blonde hair. Derek was approaching her, only the back of his head showing. She was saying something inaudibly. As he got closer, she quickly got the knife that she was holding behind her back and stabbed it into his thigh. As Derek fell to his knees, she tried to stab him again but he had already gotten the piece of the mirror out of his shirt sleeve. From this perspective it wasn’t possible to see what he did exactly, but the girl fell forward into Derek’s arms. Blood started dripping on the ground. 

That’s where I cut off the video.

After the initial moment of shock, Ashlee started screaming at the top of her lungs. I knew that she had to show some sort of reaction when she realized that the girl in the video was her own sister. 

Before she could jump Derek and possibly even kill him, I filled the room with the gas that would make them fall asleep for a while. Enough time for me to prepare the next part.",1585676798.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fshhrf/i_survived_a_horrible_social_experiment_this/

No... I must be imagining it.

I mean... *what the hell is that anyway?*

Having just finished washing my face before bed, I headed out of the bathroom and caught a glimpse of something out of place.

About ten--or maybe fifteen--feet outside my back window, was a thin shape that stood out from the colorful bed of flowers to its left, and the two or so acres of woods behind it. At first my brain identified it as a shovel someone had dug into the ground and left upright.

Yet there were a few problems with this that came to mind. The first, was that my backyard was entirely gated, and I had never had problems with trespassers before due the the height of the wrought iron and the remote location where my property sat.

The second, was that though there was not a soul or animal in sight, my motion sensor light had been triggered near the odd objects location. If someone had snuck onto my property and dug the shovel into the ground, they couldn't have done it just now.

There would have been nowhere for them to run.

And lastly, it wasn't just a long piece of wood that resembled a shovel--not exactly at least. There was a black top hat that sat curiously at the very top of the wood.

As I stared wide-eyed at the slant of the shovel-like-object and the tilt of the black hat at the very top, I felt a visceral urge to vomit.

I barely managed to contain it.

Have you ever spoken to a dog before and seen its head slightly tilt to the side in (I assume) an attempt to figure out just what the hell it is you are saying?

That's the feeling I got as I peered out the window and that black hat seemed to stare back.

And then there was darkness, as the outside motion sensor light turned off and the backyard was no longer in sight.

*Okay, that's enough Don,* I said to myself, remembering to breath and turning back to the kitchen.

Can you guess what happened next? No, probably not, unless you've encountered the same thing I did. But then again... I assume you wouldn't be able to read this if you had.

As I turned my back to the darkness, the motion sensor light came back on at that very second, and I stopped breathing again. As I turned, the object came into view again, but this time it was a few feet closer, and it was different.

Instead of just the hat, it wore something patchy and grey on its chest as well.

Thought it was almost certainly a dream, I decided to call the police, but as I did... I made another mistake: I turned my back on the thing yet again.

Reaching for the cell phone, I heard the glass window shatter onto the floor. I fell back against the wall immediately, and turned to see the creature now inside my home, standing in the circle of sharp debris.

""This can't be happening,"" I whispered to myself as I scanned the thing which was now only twenty or so feet away. It wore a black top hat, the tattered grey clothing, and now two bone-thin arms had seemed to sprout inside.

I dialed 911, and the last thing I remember was passing out. Later on I was able to hear a recording, and my voice saying, ""It's in the house.""

I can't tell you much about what happened after, cause I don't really remember... but I *can* tell you where I am now.

I call it The Overlook... but I'm sure its real name is something else. Probably some nice title that does its share to conceal just what type of lunatics it contains inside.

Crazies like me...

You see I'm allowed to write one letter a week (supervised of course), and this time I've decided to share my life story with the lot of you. Well, I suppose it's less more my story... than *its*.

*It's still here with me.*

It watches me from the corner of my room. It scurries up the walls and hangs from the ceiling. It sometimes just stands there, tilting its head towards me. Maybe it's deciding just when exactly to finish me off.

There's not much left for it to devour however, seeing how I haven't slept in weeks and continue to lose my touch with what's left of my reality. The doctors here weren't thrilled when I cut my eyelids off three--or was it four?--days ago. It was a hell of a mess, but... what else could I do?

They don't understand that every time I close my eyes... *it gets closer.*

At least this way I bought myself some time. At least this way you'll have some warning... if he comes *for you next.*

I call him the Stickman.

And [if you see him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxFLmySqBPQ)... *don't look away.*

fsj7ql,newtotownJAM,I was upset that I had no company during quarantine but now I wish I would be left alone.,145,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsj7ql,12,"It was just my luck that my router would die a day after quarantine kicked in. Stuck at home in my apartment with no company but my cat, Dorito, for at least 12 weeks. 

Dorito’s great company, I’m not dissing the little ginger fluffball, I promise, but with no internet I might’ve gone over the edge. 

Everyone was on the phone to the network provider. All those people that had been laid off, or weren’t sure if they could make enough for their next bill. I was lucky. I worked from home anyway, but only with internet. 

The hold music was as awful as any. Classical, with a message every minute or so telling me my call was important to them. It was mind numbing, especially by the 137th minute. 

It took them 138 in total to answer my call. I spent more than *two hours* of my life on hold to report a faulty router. 

The man that answered sounded utterly broken. 

“Hi, this is George with network provider, sorry for the delay, how may I help you?” 

His voice was so flat I could almost hear the countless callers before me shouting at him, or telling him about their heartbreaking circumstances. 

“Are you ok?” I asked. It was instinctive, human to human I couldn’t ignore someone that down. 

“Excuse me?” He wasn’t used to being asked. 

“You, are you ok?” I repeated, with sincerity. 

“No, madam, I’m not.”

“Well I hope your day gets better.” I responded a bit taken aback, I wasn’t expecting an honest response when I asked the question. 

I know some of you would wonder why I asked it at all if that was the case, but I just wanted him to know someone gave a shit. I knew how it felt to be lonely. 

Me and George spoke briefly, he told me all his colleagues were self isolating and he was answering all the angry and worried phone calls alone. We shared a little laugh about regretting every missed opportunity for deals on toilet paper over the years and talked about our favourite shows as he inputted my details. 

My security code was a reference to American dad and we were both in agreement of it’s superiority over family guy. 

George told me his employer had set up an equipment loan for him to work from home from the next day and he’d also be hunkering down with his cat. He sent me out a new router with a faster broadband speed on next day delivery and assured me the postal service would be able to leave it on my doorstep and that it was easy to install, I wouldn’t need someone else. 

When the call eventually ended I signed at the silence. George had been my only human interaction of the day, it felt pretty lonely to know that this would be life now. I was pleased I cheered him up a little though. He had me. 

I shut my curtains and curled up on the sofa with Dorito watching an old dvd of *how to train your dragon* and fell asleep pretty soon in. 

When I woke up the next morning Dorito was inches from my face meowing. 

Hungry. I got up to walk to the kitchen, Dorito weaving between my feet the whole way, and filled his bowl. As he crunched away I walked back into my living room and noticed a piece of paper on the floor below my letterbox. 

My apartment was an old converted house, I had my own front door, the same as the lady upstairs so I winced hoping that I hadn’t slept through my router delivery. I really would be fucked. 

I picked up the piece of paper and on it was a handwritten note.

*No response, left parcel behind wheelie bins outside property.* 

It was written in lovely cursive. I noticed that it wasn’t on one of those printed company delivery slips, just a blank bit of paper, but I was didn’t think much of it, I was just glad to get my internet back. I tossed it in the wheelie bin as I picked up my package. 

George had been right. The router hooked up really easy. I felt quite self accomplished installing it without help. I’m not one of those women who thinks they can’t do anything, I love some diy and making things, but technology has never been my strong suit. 

Collapsing on my sofa in front of Netflix with Dorito on my lap felt amazing. I perched my laptop on the arm of the chair and started typing. I run an entertainment blog. Watching Netflix and reviewing new shows is a huge part of what I do. I’m lucky, but it’s hard. You have to work constantly to make any pay in this business. 

When I first logged into my blog I noticed some comments from a new subscriber called Klaus742 on almost all of my articles. It was nice. The blog got traffic, but not a huge amount of comments. It boosted my visibility. Most of my income came from ad revenue and freelance jobs. 

The comments themselves were odd, they were all about the quality of my writing, not the content or the shows themselves. It was unusual, my blog wasn’t hugely personal, there were no photos of me on the site. I tried to write it off as flattery. Maybe someone trying to get into writing. 

I managed one post, but lockdown was getting the better of me. I didn’t go out a lot to begin with, but having the option taken away was quite distressing. The anxiety of the whole situation made my apartment claustrophobic. 

The boredom was quite something too. I was used to visiting friends, going on dates or meeting up with my mum. My best friend, Sabby, lived across the road and to the right. It was killing me not being able to just have a coffee with her. We spoke on FaceTime and waved at the window but it just wasn’t the same, she had her boyfriend and baby, so I couldn’t just relax and chat with her.

The boredom rolled on for days. After it hit day three I decided to shower and go to shops for essentials. I’d dwelled at home. I’m embarrassed about it but I was grim. I’d left all my curtains shut, hadn’t seen sunlight or even the view from my window in days. 

It felt great to be clean again and the fresh air was nice but standing at marked lines to ensure 2m distance in the shops felt surreal. I smiled at a man paying for his shopping as I begun to place mine on the conveyor belt. He was wearing those disposable blue gloves and looked as anxious as me. His smile was comforting, he was attractive and warm. The sort of guy a few weeks before I’d have tried to flirt with. 

I paid for my shopping, loaded the car, returned the trolley, sanitised my hands and got in to drive home. Just before I pulled away I noticed a faded old pay and display parking ticket on my outer windscreen. I got out of the car to take a look and there was writing on it.

*You’re pretty. Wish I could isolate with you.*

I grimaced. It was more than a little creepy. I looked around and didn’t see anyone. I stuffed the note in my pocket and got back in the car as quickly as I could. 

As I turned out of the car park so did a blue Toyota. 

The Toyota seemed to take every turn that I did. For the first few minutes I chuckled to myself, thinking about those awkward moments when you say goodbye to someone and walk the same way, but it quickly escalated. 

I lived about a 20 minute drive from the shop. Within 10 minutes I was certain I was being followed. The direction I lived in was out of the way. I’d used this store to avoid having to go to three tiny shops instead, the chances the car was genuinely going the same way were almost nil. 

I didn’t know what to do, it was dark out, I always preferred to shop in the evenings. I couldn’t make out in my mirror any distinguishing features of the driver. Just that they were alone. I thought about the note in my pocket and a lump formed in my throat. 

I drove as calmly as I could in the opposite direction of my house. I had no plan, but I knew not to lead this person to my door. The car followed me for another 20 minutes before it finally disappeared. 

By this point I was about 45 minutes from home, but relieved. I pulled over and took a few breaths in my car. I was startled by a knock on my drivers side window. I rolled it down to see a policeman. He had stood back from the window and was looking at me sympathetically. 

“Hello miss, I just want to check that you’re out for essential purposes, we’re checking at random.” 

I broke down. I told him what had happened, that I’d been followed, I showed him the note. He seemed concerned and was genuinely listening to what I had to say. Or I thought so until he spoke. 

“Right, get yourself home miss, and if you’re worried about getting out for shopping why don’t you ask a friend or relative to help. These are frightening times, it can make everything seem like more than it is.” He waved me off and I realised the smile that I had previously found kind was incredibly patronising. 

He didn’t believe me, he thought I was exaggerating, but I knew something wasn’t right about that car. I drove home in tears imagining what could have happened if they kept following. How long would I have driven before giving up?

Once I reached my front door I missed the lock with my key multiple times because my hands were shaking. It took 2 trips to unload my shopping and the second trip made my heart pound. I just wanted to be home. 

Once I locked myself in I shut the curtains back up and grabbed Dorito for a hug. We curled up on the sofa and I tried to write another blog post about the new tiger king documentary. 

I tried for hours, I swear. My mind was too full to get into it, I couldn’t give it an accurate review because I was missing bits not paying attention and I gave up. 

Just as I was about to shut the laptop and resign myself to scrolling Facebook on my phone with the crazy tiger guy in the background I got a notification. It was a new comment on my previous blog post. It made my blood run cold. 

*You looked beautiful today at the store. Can’t wait until this is over and I can touch you.* - **Klaus742**

I snapped the laptop shut fast and swept through my home, turning on all the lights and checking every room. It’s unbelievable, how much impact a few words on the internet can have. I felt sick, like Klaus742 had violated the safety of my living room. 

I tried hard to remember who I’d seen at the store. The cute guy at the checkout? I don’t remember seeing him when I got there and he left before me, how would he know what car was mine?

I must have seen a hundred different faces and I couldn’t say for certain it was any of them. I couldn’t see the person in the car. I couldn’t even be sure it was a man but the evidence pointed that way. 

My phone buzzed. It was Sabby. 

*I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your life but we are on lockdown Lou. I know you enjoy your dates but you shouldn’t have people in and out at the moment.*

I text back immediately. 

*what are you on about?*

*The guy I just saw leave your house from the side gate and drive away in his car. I don’t think late night hook ups is great social distancing.*

I raced to the window and peeked through a small gap in the curtains. I couldn’t see anything. Whoever it was had gone. I dialled Sabby. 

She was terrified for me and apologised for her texts. She told me to report it to the police but I told her the response I’d had when I was stopped. They’d just think I had a local admirer who had spotted me at the store. They hadn’t threatened me, and I couldn’t prove it was the same person outside my house. 

I wanted to check the perimeter but I was too terrified to be outside, to leave Dorito and my sofa sanctum. Sabby was upset that she couldn’t be with me to comfort me or try and help me secure the apartment a little better. I wished I didn’t have to be alone too. 

I didn’t sleep well that night. I spent hours staring at the ceiling worrying. About 5am I relented and got out of bed to make coffee. 

There it was. In big black marker letters on my kitchen window. 

“It’ll be over soon. Then me and you.” 

I froze, staring at it. I didn’t know if it had been written the night before or more recently. I figured the man last night had been coming from the side of my house so it must have been done then. It was too dark outside to notice. In the morning sunshine the message was clear.

How the fuck did Klaus742 have my address? I wasn’t just frightened, I was angry. I called the police to report it. It took an hour and a half for a car to come out. 

They looked at the scene and took photos from inside and outside the window. They seemed to almost admire the effort he’d gone to writing the message backwards so I could read it from the other side. They tried to take fingerprints but told me whoever this was had been careful, there were no prints to take. 

“So what should I do?” I asked as they got back in their patrol car. 

“Stay calm miss, keep your doors locked, make a note of anything else that happens and give us a call if you have any problems.” 

“But what if he comes back?!” I pleaded with them. 

“Then you call 999 straight away. Be safe, stay inside and keep the doors locked.”

They shut the car doors and drove off. I didn’t feel any safer than I had when I found the message, but I took their advice. I got back inside, locked and dead bolted the doors and curled back up on the sofa with Dorito. He purred as I stroked his chin, it was soothing. 

Two days went by with nothing. I started to feel safe again. I made a post on my blog and received no comments from Klaus742. 

Then yesterday morning I took my kitchen bin out to the the wheelie bin at the front. On my doorstep was a bundle of post. I had heard the postmen were going contactless so I wasn’t too alarmed. I picked it up and threw it down on the sofa as I came in and locked back up. I sat down to start opening them.

They looked like mostly bills, nothing unusual. Then as I picked them up two photographs dropped to the floor from the bundle.

One showed an image of my living room from outside the window taken from what must be up against the glass. The second was far more sinister. It was a photograph of my living room from inside the house, aimed directly at the sofa... as me and Dorito slept on it. 

I felt a panic surge through me and I looked at the photo for anything, a face in a reflection, a timestamp, anything. But it wasn’t there, just me and Dorito sleeping peacefully. I turned the photo over and there was writing on it. 

*It’s like I’m here with you.*

The words cut through me like a knife, they shattered any sense of security left in me, I was terrified. 

The words were scrawled but in a fairly neat cursive, which got me thinking. 

I ran outside to the wheelie bin. Collection day is tomorrow so it was full but I only had to pull a few bags out to find what I was looking for, I knew I’d thrown it in loose. 

I took my prize back inside and pulled apart my washing basket searching for the hoodie I had worn to the store. It was there, and in the pocket, so was the note that was on the windscreen. 

I laid them all out in front of me. The windscreen note, the photograph from today and the handwritten sorry we missed you slip. They were a perfect match. 

I took another look at the photo itself. The angle the photo’s taken from meant the camera would have to be right in front of my television, I looked at the spot. Staring back at me was that damn new router. The more I thought about it the more pieces came together. 

The fucking fish. 

Klaus742. The only other Klaus I could name was that fucking talking fish from American dad. 

George.

He had access to all of it, my address, my ip, my phone number, everything. 

My palms sweated. It was such a simple interaction. He was just a faceless man in a call centre who sounded sad. I trusted him with all my personal information. My name, address and online details. I lead my stalker directly to me. 

The police arrived quicker this time. They took the router away in an evidence bag and the photographs and notes in another. I gave a full statement, told them all about my phone call with George and showed them the comments from Klaus742.

They took me seriously. For real this time, not like the officer on the roadside. 

I spent my day without internet to distract me and feeling jittery, but I feel better knowing the router and whatever camera was attached was out of house. 

The police called me around 5pm to tell me they’d managed to get in touch with network provider, George’s employer. They didn’t have good news. The company couldn’t find records for anyone with the name George working in the call centre. They were opening an investigation into a potential hack of their telephone server. 

The police told me that they were doing everything they could to find George and would be interviewing all employees who were working the day of my call.  

It didn’t fill me with a huge sense of relief. If George was a hacker this could take months and things were escalating fast. I didn’t have time for them to interview people. 

I tried my best to proof the house. I checked every room for camera or audio equipment. I didn’t believe that George had been inside but I didn’t want to tempt fate. I deadbolts the front and back door and placed large items in front of them.   

I called Sabby and updated her on everything. I wanted someone to know what was happening to me, so if anything goes wrong, well... someone knew. 

Things took a turn when I noticed the Toyota outside on one of my regular curtain twitching patrols. I could just about see a figure sitting in the drivers seat and I lost it. I grabbed a large kitchen knife and flew out of the house towards the car. 

I noticed him lock the doors as I got nearer, and put the key in the ignition. I turned to look at Sabbys house, but it was dark, all the houses on the road were, no one was awake.

“Stop!” I screamed, desperately, my fingers gripped tightly around the knife. If he drove away now this was just going to carry on. 

I started crying. It’s embarrassing but I cry when I’m angry, I can’t help it, it’s just a natural reaction I have to being distressed. I stood in the middle of my street with a kitchen knife in my hand and cried. I must have looked hysterical. I was, really. 

He rolled down the window, hands of the wheel ready to pull away and our eyes met. It wasn’t the first time, I had seen him before, the cute man in front of me in the grocery store. Once he spoke his face wasn’t the only thing I recognised. The voice was unmistakeable, that sad, deflated voice from the phone. 

“Why won’t you just talk to me. You took away my access, ok, fair enough. But the police, Lou? Is it really necessary?” He looked at me sincerely, believing every word that he said. 

“I don’t know you. Please, just leave me alone.” I pleaded. 

“Oh but you do know me! We were getting along so well! That’s why I can’t understand why you’ve gone so cold on me, I was a bit full on, yeah, but I know you’re lonely too. Wouldn’t it be better to be together?” 

He disgusted me, everything about him disgusted me. I started to walk away, picking up speed with every step towards my house. I was going to dial the police, I promise. I didn’t look back.

I didn’t look back.

If I’d have looked back I’d have seen him following. If my senses hadn’t been so overloaded I would have heard him close the car door, come up behind me. If I’d have just been quicker he wouldn’t have made it into the house with me. 

And if My mind had just been clearer, I might have been able to just hurt him, not kill him. 

The police were sympathetic. They looked at me like I was some sort of wounded puppy. Not a murderer. It didn’t matter. I’d never get his dead body out of my mind, his cold dead eyes, glazed over amongst the blood all over his handsome face. 

They’re going to investigate me. But my neighbour across the street had cctv and it caught the whole thing. That and the police reports I made leading up to the incident should prove self defence. 

I’ve spent the day indoors. Just me and Dorito. This morning I cleaned George’s blood off the carpet by the front door. The carpet was cream, I had to use bleach to remove it so while it may not be red the stains still there, a constant reminder. 

I wrote this down to try and make sense of what’s happened. To try and use some of these quarantine hours to process it. But I keep getting distracted. I left the curtains open today, like an act of defiance. I didn’t want to continue to feel unsafe in my own home. 

I’ve sat in front of the window typing for hours now and Dorito’s been meowing like mad behind me but I didn’t look back. 

I didn’t look back. But when I finally did, there he was. George has been watching me from the window ever since. No matter what I do he just won’t leave.",1585682124.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsj7ql/i_was_upset_that_i_had_no_company_during/
fsnq0k,TOALWOboe-Wan-Kenobi,The Man in the Tub,10,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsnq0k,0,"So, this was about a year ago.

I was at a Christian get together thing called DNOW, where all the eighth grade guys get together in one host home, etc.

My host home was hosted by my long time best friend, who we shall call Josh, his aunt. I didn't know the layout of the house, since the entire first day, I stayed in the living room. Josh and I had put our sleeping bags in the corner of the room, next to the TV stand and some windows with the kind of blinds where you can only see in from one angle. He played Apex Legends with some of the other guys while I did homework I forgot to finish in the corner.

Once we had finished doing all the Christian bible study stuff, it was around 9:45 PM, and we decided to watch some horror stories. We watched Cicada, which isn't really a horror story, as well as several dark web horror stories about torture. Josh got super paranoid by around 11:45, so we decided to turn off his laptop and get some sleep. 

I woke up at around three, a I _really_ had to use the restroom. The thing is, I didn't know where it was. I shook Josh to try to wake him up, but all he did was turn to me, mumble, and turn away from me, asleep again. I gave up on him, and decided to use my phones dim screen light to find it, since I didn't want to wake up the other guys with my flashlight. 

I got up and carefully stepped around the other guys and walked to my left. I ended up in the kitchen, so I grabbed a MoonPie from a box of them one of the other guys had brought, and went back. There was a hallway I hadn't looked down yet, so I decided to check there. I got to the edge of the hall, and saw an open door to a room with a sink in it. I silently cheered and rushed over to relieve myself. I got inside, locked the door and got onto the toilet, not turning on the light because I was to tired to think to.

I got on my phone and started looking through Reddit, when I looked up, and by the light on my phone, I could see, inside the bathtub less than three feet in front of me, half of an eye and the side of someone's head. I freaked out and left the bathroom, half running back to my sleeping bag. After a couple minutes of lying there, staring at the hall, I looked over at Josh--except he wasn't there. Instead, his pillow was stuffed inside his sleeping bag.

He couldn't be in the bathroom, I just came from there. I waited for almost an hour, and he still hadn't come back. This is where I did something pretty dumb.

I decided to go look for him. I looked inside for half an hour before deciding he wasn't inside the house (but I didn't check the bathroom because of the face). I decided to go and look outside. I slowly unlocked the front door, but when I tried to open it, it was locked. The door had already been unlocked. And there weren't any signs of struggle. 

I disregarded this, and unlocked the door and stepped outside into the cool crisp night air. I immediately noticed that there were three vehicles in the drive way instead of the two that were there when we had gone to sleep (one for Josh's uncle and one for his aunt). There were two pickup trucks and an SUV. My blood ran cold. There was no one in any of the cars. I looked around the yard. Nothing was out of the ordinary. I walked around the side of the house and entered their backyard. I froze. There was a scrawny guy standing by a bush next to the windows by where Josh and I had had laid our sleeping bags. I spun around when I heard the sound of crunching leaves coming around the corner from the front lawn, so I dove into a bush. A burly guy with a long thick beard came around the corner and walked up to the scrawny guy.

""Dave, hurry up and get him in the back. That kid you saw is gone, and I want to be gone before we figure out where he went."" The scrawny guy turned to the burly guy.
""He backed into a bush! I cant reach him!""
The burly guy shoved Dave out of the way and reached into the bush and pulled out a scraped up Josh. The burly guy punched Josh in the face. Josh yelped and fell to the ground. Dave rushed around and began to tie up Josh. They both then walked back around the corner. I got put of the bush and followed them slowly. They put Josh into the back of one of the pickups. I gave up all secrecy and ran towards their pickup. The burly guy jumped into the driver's seat, followed by Dave, and they sped off, leaving me in the driveway. I ran back into the house and got Josh's aunt. She called the police, and they sent out a search team.

They found nothing until the following Sunday,  when Josh was found dead in a dumpster behind a Chuck E Cheeses.",1585696573.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsnq0k/the_man_in_the_tub/

[3]",325,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsl6tt,27,"[I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fo51xt/i_joined_a_support_group_that_promised_to_cure_me/) | [II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fpaj6j/i_joined_a_support_group_that_promised_to_cure_me/) | III

The conclusion of Thomasine’s harrowing tale left my chest tight, my palms coated in a light sweat. She’d endured such trauma that I was amazed she even built up the courage to attend the group at all. Then again, Cecily had her fair share of trauma relating to her phobia, and I’ve certainly had mine as well, so I could only assume that the remaining five participants – Don on my left, then Valo, Tegen, Alec, and back around at my right, Edie, must have similarly horrifying stories to share.

With two down, six to go, the only question left was –

“Who’s next?”

Cecily voiced my internal question, the one likely on everyone else’s minds; everyone save for the next in line, number three.

Valo, hunched over with his forearms laid over his thighs and his enormous hands laced together, lifted his head to answer, “it’s me. I’m next.”

I glanced over at the hulking man. Astonishingly, he was somehow able to blend in with his surroundings despite having such a commanding presence when he spoke in his booming, baritone voice. The man, probably in his thirties, easily stood over six and a half feet tall, dwarfing gaunt Tegen on his left and Don, a considerably smaller man, on his right. He’d dressed much more professionally than the rest of us, wearing a white button up shirt with black slacks and a perfectly knotted tie.

“I’m Valo,” he announced as he straightened his posture to sit upright in his seat. I was worried the flimsy chair would collapse underneath his weight. “I have octophobia. I’m afraid of the number eight.”

“So that’s why you asked me to read your number, huh?” Tegen asked, lazily exhaling a mouthful of smoke as she turned towards him. She chuckled inertly as she added, “here I was, thinking you couldn’t read.”

Valo returned with his own unenthusiastic laugh, a sudden sadness in his dark eyes. “I, uhm, I can assure you I can read quite well… before I acquired my phobia, I was studying mathematics in one of the top graduate school programs for my field.”

“And now you’re afraid of a *number*?” Don questioned, incredulous. I shot him a quick glare.

The taller man shrugged loosely in response before explaining, “well, it’s not really the *number* itself I’m afraid of, it’s the… the shape of it. The figure eight, as they say.”

He outstretched a long digit to trace the shape, starting at the top, making one half circle then crossing in the middle, drawing the circle at the bottom before coming back up to complete the top loop on the unfinished side.

“I was researching number theory, believe it or not,” he mused, dropping his hand down back into his lap with a dull slap. “Number theory involves the properties and relationships of numbers, particularly positive integers, that is… whole numbers, not fractions. So, one, two, three, four…” He paused to take a loud, dry swallow. “…et cetera.”

I leaned forward, clasping the stump of my left wrist in my right hand, my brow furrowed. I could sympathize with fearing something so mundane. “What happened, Valo?”

He took several deep breaths, in, out, in, out. I wondered how large his lungs must be. “I got a little too deep into my work, I must admit,” he responded, flashing a shy smile, his teeth strikingly white against his dark skin. “Growing up, I always loved numbers… math was my favorite subject. It only seemed natural that I would study mathematics in university. I graduated at the top of my class and moved onto a PhD with a focus in number theory.

“Opening that letter, the letter of my acceptance into this prestigious program… it was the happiest day of my life,” Valo reminisced, gazing down at his quivering hands. His soft, deep voice similarly wavered, and I thought he might cry at any moment. “A couple years into my graduate program, my love of numbers it… well, it grew into something more of an obsession. I loved them all, but I revered the number eight most of all. I remember one day, I was working on my thesis, and I went to write the number eight. I started drawing it and I just… I kept going. Even after I’d closed both loops, I went over it again, again, again…”

Valo trailed off, seemingly consumed by his own troubled thoughts. He shook his head quickly, his sweet smile returning. “Well, you get the point. I came to realize that the number eight represented the infinite nature of the universe. I was absolutely enamored with the number, the figure eight. I started seeing it… everywhere. In the imprints a graceful figure skater left on the ice, earth worms wriggling on the sidewalk after a rainfall, drivers racing around a track, even the plastic loops that surrounded the cans of soda I drank daily. The figure eight, and how often I saw it, it became a sign to me… a sign that the beauty of life and love was never ending…

“I wish I could have known back then just how wrong I was.”

As the giant man dropped his head into his massive hands, Thomasine encouraged, “take your time, Valo. It’ll feel better once you talk about it, I promise.”

Looking up once more, he nodded in solemn acceptance. “I tried to present my… er, findings, to my mentors. Needless to say, they were not impressed. I’d put all of my research time into my philosophy describing the true meaning of the number eight, the secret ancient mathematicians were trying to convey, to whisper into each flick and turn of the number… I couldn’t accept it when my superiors told me to refocus my research. I didn’t stop. I only dove in further, until I stopped fulfilling my necessary duties. I missed deadlines. I stopped attending my meetings. Ultimately, I was discharged from the program.

“I wasn’t discouraged, though… not then, at least,” he breathed, rubbing his smooth, shaved head with one massive hand. “I immersed myself in my studies. Everywhere I looked, I saw another figure eight… a pair of glasses on stranger’s face, a script *s*, the path the sun travels through the sky over a year, the strokes in a painting joining to create the holy shape… each encounter with the figure bringing me closer to the infinite, closer to God.”

He drew a shaking breath in through pursed lips, loosening his tie as a sheen of sweat cropped up across his glistening forehead. “I was staying up for days at a time… I took up drinking to help me get some sleep each night because every time I closed my eyes, all I could see what the figure eight. I fell into alcoholism pretty quickly… I’d sit at the local bar early in the afternoon until late at night, spreading the word of the holy shape, the figure eight, to anyone who’d listen.

“Admittedly, that wasn’t very many,” he remarked, laughing through his nose as he reminisced upon his bizarre behavior. ""One evening, I was at the bar, drinking a pint of cheap beer – I’d all but run out of money by then – pressing the bottom of the bottle on the bar in front of me… when I placed the bottle down once on the left and then immediately to the right, the condensation left behind formed a figure eight. I was running my finger endlessly through the shape when a man sat down beside me, wearing a hooded black coat.

“We talked for a long while, and eventually I got into my spiel about the figure eight. As I was tracing the number on the table, the man looked directly at me for the first time and I saw his face…” Valo recalled, the imagery of his memory causing him shudder. “His face was incredibly pale, almost featureless, his mouth small and bordered by a pair of thin lips, barely there… his nose, almost flat, but his eyes… his eyes were the most unsettling.

“They were unnaturally close together, meeting over the subtle bridge of his nose, but just barely… intersecting at one point in the middle of the two orbs. My eyes traced the outline… a f-figure eight,” he sputtered, ejecting a mist of spittle as he struggled to form the f sound, turbulent and labored.

Valo paused to wipe his bottom lip on the edge of his dress shirt sleeve, perfectly pressed. His professional attire stood in stark contrast to his demeanor as he rapidly devolved into a deeply anxious, stuttering version of himself that I never expected when he first entered the room.

“Now, I’ll be the first to admit I was wasted, but I know what I saw,” he asserted emphatically, throwing his open hands up in front of him as if he expected the group to attack or belittle him at any moment.

“There’s no cause for worry with me, dear. I believe you,” Edie reassured. I nodded in agreement of her statement, as did the rest of the group. We all knew the power of fear, the unbridled power of phobias. They can play tricks on the mind, make you see things that aren’t there, or rather – explode something innocuous into a catastrophic version of itself, into something that warrants immediate escape.

He visibly calmed upon the collective’s feedback, his shoulders relaxing, facial features softening. “Thank you… anyway, I knew what I saw, and the figure eight formed by his eyes struck me with such a terror, so vastly different from the euphoria it had brought before. My reaction both confused and troubled me, but all I knew was that I had to get *out*. I practically flew out of the door, unfinished pint glass on the table, I even left my card at the bar… I never came back for it.

“I should’ve called a cab, but the combination of intoxication and panic left me incapable of forming a coherent plan. I jumped in my car and set off on the familiar route towards home. It wasn’t a far drive, I thought I’d be fine, especially since there were – strangely – no other cars out. Somewhere along the road, though, the route became… it became a lot less familiar.

“There was a four-way intersection in the road, one I’d never seen before despite having driven along it practically every day… I thought it must have been new, because there were no stop signs or traffic lights or anything,” he explained, shaking his head in disbelief. “I carefully slowed to a stop anyway and kept going… I reassured myself that I was almost home, just a couple more minutes, but where the street should have kept going straight towards my house, an unexpected slight right turn materialized. Drunk and scattered, I took the novel turn and kept driving, suddenly becoming aware of the abnormal curvature of the road, streets that I knew to be fairly straight were now forcing me to turn the steering wheel ever so slightly to stay on track.”

Valo grew increasingly frantic, eyes bulging, hands waving as he ranted, “and then, somehow, I was back at that four-way intersection but coming from another direction, I rolled through it, then followed the strange curve of the road up to another slight left turn that just shouldn’t have *been* there, it was wrong, but I was drunk, I needed to get back home, sure that I would be okay if I just got home and laid down, so I took it and kept going until I found myself back there… back at the bar.”

Tegen gasped involuntarily as she took a drag off her cigarette, smoke flowing out in sporadic bursts as she wheezed and coughed dryly.

After her coughing subsided, Valo cleared his own throat into a closed fist. “The hooded man was standing outside, waving, which only furthered my panic. I slammed down on the gas, telling myself that this time I would get home, this time would be normal, this time I’d be okay, but I didn’t really believe any of that. My fears were confirmed when I came up at that intersection again, drove through it, found that right turn deviating the normal route, went right back around to that intersection again, then the left turn, then back at the bar.

“It took me several times around to realize that I was driving along a figure eight pattern, the shape I’d essentially worshiped for years, what I thought to be the meaning of life itself. It was… *infinite*… but not infinite in its joy and beauty like I’d always believed, but *endless*, a terrible, monotonous trap that left me panicked, desperate for escape like a caged animal. I took that route over, and over, and over again for what felt like hours.

“Eventually, I lost all desire to live. If death meant escaping the trap I’d found myself in, I would have gladly taken it. I sped up, wavering between the two lanes, until I was pushing ninety miles per hour. I veered off course, tires screeching as I took a sharp right off the road and straight into a tree.”

Alec’s jaw dropped. “I’m amazed you’re still sitting here with us today.”

Valo chuckled cynically, a harsh, gruff sound. A sweat stain had spread underneath his arms over the course of his fervent storytelling. “I actually did die, but I was resuscitated after the owners of the property I’d crashed on called for help. I ended up with a lot of broken bones and a very serious traumatic brain injury.

“I fell into a coma… even when I woke up, I was completely unresponsive to my surroundings for a while. My sister visited me every day, keeping me company and caring for me in small ways. I did eventually recover – not completely, of course… I moved in with my sister when I was finally discharged because I need help remembering things sometimes. One day, she asked me what I saw when I died, when I was comatose, when I was awake but unresponsive.”

The beginnings of tears welled in his dark eyes as he elaborated, “I told her I saw a light, that I was surrounded by infinite love and warmth… my sister is a woman of faith. I told her what she wanted to hear, because I couldn’t stand to break her heart. I couldn’t stand to tell her what I actually saw, what I know now lies beyond this life.

“In reality, when I died I saw… *nothing*,” Valo revealed grimly, then laughed in spite of himself. “Somehow, I ended up being right about the meaning of life, the universe, all of that… it is a figure eight – infinite, never ending. But just like that road, it is *endless* in its monotony, in its nothingness, in its loneliness, in its *darkness*.

“When I found out what happened after I opened my eyes for the first time in that hospital bed, my phobia of the figure eight was solidified. While I was locked in that residual nothingness, the darkness from the moments I had died, conscious but just barely… my sister told me that I wouldn’t look at her like one normally does as she spoke, or if she walked into the room.

“Instead, my eyes… they moved rapidly, constantly looking around the room… repeatedly tracing the… the figure eight,” he stammered, digging his nails into his palms as he silently began to cry. “Since then, my feelings of reverence for the figure eight have been replaced entirely by anxiety, panic, and horror. I’m a complete recluse… I keep to myself, and I mostly stay in my room because whenever I see the number eight, I’m plunged headfirst back into that darkness.

“I’ll only realize when my sister finds me, sometimes hours later, and startles me back to alertness… I’ll only realize then that I’d been tracing the shape of the figure eight with my eyes, lost in the endless nothingness [that it represents](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).”

==========

We drove down the city streets with Minerva in the passenger seat with the window rolled down and Jacob sitting in the back awkwardly twiddling his thumbs. Every time I glanced in the rearview mirror, he quickly averted his eyes like he had been caught stealing.

“What?”

He cleared his throat.

“Do I have something on my face, bell-boy?”

“I’m not a *bell-boy*,” he muttered. “I was just thinking about, you know. About Aron. You do look a little bit like him. Especially in that photo.”

I didn’t say anything.

“It’s crazy,” Jacob said. “I never knew the boys at the station used to be… *real people*.”

We stopped at a red light. After a moment of silence, I let out a small sigh.

“On that day, we were on our way to meet our parents in the plaza.”

The story hurt to tell, but I had to. I wasn’t sure why. Maybe to prove to Jacob that Aron was a *real person*.

“Gracie was an old dog, and we were careless kids. We let her get too close to the edge of the platform and she fell down onto the tracks. Aron jumped down after her to save her. But he was a short nine-year-old, and after he helped Gracie up to the platform, he couldn’t get out himself. Not ten seconds later, the jingle signaling the subway’s approach was playing, and then…”

I trailed off. When I glanced in the rearview mirror, Jacob was looking down, fidgeting with his hands.

“I’m sorry,” he said.

“The train didn’t stop,” I muttered. “By the time it got to where Aron was, it should have slowed down enough for the conductor to see him and pull the brakes. But it didn’t stop, and when it blew past me, I swear…”

I took a shaky breath.

“I swear I saw the conductor smiling.”

I half-expected Jacob to laugh. He didn’t.

“Percy tried to kill me once with a bus accident,” he said. “He puppeteered the driver and drove the bus into a wall. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was controlling the conductor.”

I looked at him in disbelief. His expression was grim.

“I don’t know how long the boys have been around for, but they sure as hell aren’t ten years old. And if I know anything about them, I know that they love to play with people’s lives. They won’t hesitate to kill.”

“But Aron…”

Jacob looked at me apologetically.

The light turned green. I turned my eyes back on the road.

==========

We parked at an empty curb a few paces from the station and got out of the car. The entrance to the underground was an escalator that didn’t move.

Minerva paced around me, on high alert. She still didn’t seem eager to be close to Jacob, but she also seemed to have decided he wasn’t going to kill me. As we walked down the broken escalator, we began to hear the sound of chattering voices and peas rattling in cans of spray paint. The familiar scent of paint lingered in the air.

I didn’t know what I expected to see, but Emeldahm Station was largely the same as I remembered it. Ugly white fluorescent lights illuminated the small underground. The ceiling was held up by low concrete arches, and past the rusted turnstiles, a red brick staircase led down to the platform. A security guard’s booth was tucked to the side, its glass windows dark. The sound of a train rushing by the platform rattled through the floor, a train that didn’t stop at this station anymore.

There were a dozen people scattered along the walls with paint rollers and brushes and cans in their hands. The walls were already blooming with color. When we emerged into the underground, the artist closest to the escalator noticed us and waved. He lowered his brush and pulled down his respirator.

“You’re Abigail, right?”

“Yeah. You know me?”

“Of course! I recognize you from the photo on your application.”

Jacob winced. He was already hating this, I could tell.

“My name’s Bill,” the artist said. “Feel free to talk to me or any of the other folks if you need help, but otherwise, just pick a spot and get started. There’s plenty of wall space still. You’re free to go down to the lower level where the platform is, too. And if you ever get hungry, there’s a snack table over by the far wall.”

I thanked him and walked into the station. Jacob kept glancing around at the artists.

“I really don’t like this,” he muttered. “Don’t you feel like we’re being watched?”

“Maybe,” I said, though I didn’t really. “But we need to find Aron.”

“I told you, he’s… he’s changed.”

“Maybe he remembers me.”

Aside from the painters, there was nobody on the top level. As we walked toward the turnstiles, I glanced at the snack table that had been set up against one of the walls. The artists had been prudent enough to put clear plastic lids on the trays of donuts, so that the spray paint dust wouldn’t get in. Next to the trays was a water cooler, and a small basket of wrapped candies.

I stopped.

“Jacob…”

He looked at me, and then at the snack table. At the half-empty basket of Smarties.

“Oh, *no*.”

Minerva began to bark.

Half the artists stopped their work and turned toward us, with motions far too synchronized to be natural. Bill pulled off his respirator. He was smiling wide.

“I thought I had told you to stay out of the station,” he said, his voice twisting into a giddy singsong. “Did you want to play that badly?”

All around us, the artists who were looking at us tossed aside their brushes and cans and broke into a sprint toward us. Before I could even try to run, they slammed into me and knocked me to the ground. The concrete scraped hard against my back. Coarse, dusty hands pinned down my arms and legs.

“*Jacob!*”

Through the pile of bodies, I caught a glimpse of Jacob, gripping his pistol between his hands. He was shaking. Unsure of what to do. The remaining artists were looking at us now, their eyes wide. Somebody screamed.

Even as I cried for help, I knew why Jacob wouldn’t shoot. It was the same reason he couldn’t hurt Eileen. Percy’s puppets were innocent people. Perfectly innocent, perfectly regular people. One carelessly placed shot, and they would be dead.

Something was pulling on my waist. Too frantic, too erratic to be a person. Minerva was barking like mad, yanking on her leash.

Bill walked up to me, unwrapping a roll of Smarties in his hand. He giggled like a child.

“Bad girls need to be punished,” he said. “You’ll be much better as a puppet.”

He crouched down and grabbed my face, then wormed his gloved fingers between my lips in an attempt to force my mouth open. I bit his fingers, hard. He recoiled, howling in pain.

“Jacob,” I cried. “I need my arm!”

Thankfully, he understood. I saw him close one eye and fix the other on the lady holding down my wrist. Then he raised his hand and put the barrel of his pistol up against his palm.

He whispered something that got buried in the raucous. *I’m sorry*.

The *crack* of a gunshot echoed through the underground. Black blood spurted from Jacob’s open eye. The lady screamed as an invisible bullet punched a tiny hole through her hand. She let go of me, clutching her wound.

Bill slammed the palm of his gloved hand into my forehead, pinning my head down. His other hand came down on my chin.

I drew a can of spray paint from my belt, swung the nozzle up to his face, and emptied a can of *Electric Pink* into his eyes.

Bill screamed. All the puppets faltered for just a moment. I dropped the can, reached for the side of my waist, and unclipped Minerva’s leash from my belt.

Minerva made a beeline for the security guard’s booth, barking the whole way. I drew another can of spray paint and slammed the bottom of it into the side of Bill’s face. The puppets faltered, again. The hands around my ankles loosened. I kicked off the two painters holding down my legs.

Minerva was scratching at the door of the security guard’s booth, barking her head off. Jacob ran over to it and threw the door open. Whatever was inside, he was ready for it. He closed one eye, the bloody one this time, and put his pistol up to his temple.

*Crack.*

The bodies piled up on top of me instantly fell motionless. Bill collapsed to the floor.

I squirmed out of the dogpile and ran to the security guard’s booth. Inside the cramped walls, Percy had collapsed facedown on the floor.

Jacob was bleeding from both eyes. He reached out his hand and I caught it.

“I… I can’t see,” he said.

“No shit. Come on, let’s get down to the platform.”

“What?”

I pried the pistol from his grip and looked around. In the chaos, the artists who hadn’t turned into Percy’s puppets had all run away, thankfully. I scanned the ceiling until I spotted the smoke detector.

“Here’s hoping I’m a crack shot.”

“*What?*”

I cocked the gun, took out a can of black paint, and lobbed it toward the smoke detector. Then I raised the pistol and lined up the sights.

*Crack.*

The spray paint can exploded into a spiraling black cloud. The little red light on the smoke detector flared.

High-pitched sirens blared through the underground. Rusted metal shutters began to descend over the arched passageway to the turnstiles. I grabbed Jacob, picked up Minerva’s leash, and made a mad dash for the passageway. As I shoved Jacob through the turnstiles, I risked a quick glance behind us.

The puppets were beginning to stir.

We clambered over the turnstiles, ducked, and slipped underneath the fire shutters just before they slammed down onto the floor, cutting off the top level of the underground.

As soon as the shutters closed, my adrenaline sputtered out, and I almost collapsed at the top of the stairs to the platform. Minerva proudly wagged her tail and skipped around my legs.

I looked at Jacob. His right eye had healed completely. The wound in his left eye was closing remarkably quickly, the torn bits of membrane grafting back together before my eyes. The black blood on his shirt bubbled and evaporated into smoke.

He gawked at me like I’d just come back from the dead.

“What?”

As he continued to stare at me, the last cut across his iris knit closed, and his left eye returned to normal. He rubbed his forehead and let out a small sigh.

“You’re insane.”

I grinned. “There’s a pinch of insanity in every artist’s soul.”

I handed him the pistol and he pocketed it.

“What now?”

As if by some unspoken argument, we all turned toward the stairs to the platform, even Minerva. At the bottom of the red brick stairs, the fluorescent lights were flickering ominously.

Then, before any of us could say anything, all the lights blinked out.

Minerva started barking, again. I reached out and grabbed Jacob.

In the pitch-black darkness, between the barks and the muted whine of the fire alarm, I began to hear a new sound. It sounded like rain, or maybe like a million snakes slithering over leaves. Goosebumps ran down my arms.

“He’s here,” Jacob whispered.

When the lights came back on, he was there, standing halfway down the stairs and looking up at us inquisitively. My big brother from thirteen years ago. The boy in the photograph. Wearing the same oversized T-shirt and the same dirty jeans he had worn, when he jumped down onto the train tracks to save our dog.

Even after all these years, he was nine years old.

Minerva growled.

When the boy smiled, he had my brother’s smile from the photograph. When he spoke, he had my brother’s voice. The voice that echoed in my memories.

“Jacob,” he said. “I’m so glad you’ve come to play with us.”

Jacob was trembling. He held one hand in his pocket, gripping his pistol.

Aron turned his eyes to me.

“Who’s your friend? You need to introduce her to me.”

“Aron,” I whispered. “It’s me. It’s me, Abbey.”

Aron cocked his head.

“Abbey?”

For a few seconds, he didn’t say anything. Then he smiled.

“Nice to meet you, Abbey. My name’s Aron. And I…”

Minerva snarled and pressed up against my leg. I heard a wet ripping sound from somewhere behind Aron. No, from somewhere *inside* him.

His neck bent at a strange angle, and the skin of his back split open, spilling forth a mass of shadowy black matter.

fsol6s,SpOoKyCaT--,My Mom Checks In On Me When I Sleep,9,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsol6s,3,"Let me preface this by saying I just moved into a new house with my mom, my dad and my two older brothers. I’m 19, and Wendell is turning 20 pretty soon, and the other, Liam, is 22. 

My mom always used to check in on us when we (mostly me) were younger. Nothing creepy or nefarious, but we were just...going through some hard times and I think my mom needed remind herself that if she and dad failed, we would be hurt by that. I don’t know if this is true and this is just my assumption. My mom is more or less a perfectionist and it broke her heart to know that she and dad were struggling to provide for us. 

Anyway, we just moved out to a ranch (68 acres of land) and at first I was uneasy because of all the horror movies I watched about being in an isolated place — talk about being serial killed and not being found ever and becoming a mummy. Then our house becomes a spooky and abandoned house teenagers and young adults explore making fake ghost videos about — but I didn’t have to worry about that because I was already moving into my residence and dealing with my first year of college. My brothers were barely home because they had jobs that took up most of their time, and my dad is an oil field worker. My mom is the only one at home consistently with the cat and dog. My mom and my dad were always telling me and my brothers about the slightly strange occurrences that happen in the home sometimes that just...make them go “huh.” Nothing too extremely spooky. Just...odd. 

I’ve been back from school for at least a month because of the global pandemic of [redacted] (y’all know what I’m talking about but I seriously don’t want to talk about it anymore) and honestly things have gotten downright spooky. 

It started at midnight. My bedroom door opened, making an obnoxious (but not scary) opening sound. I blearily blinked out the sleep in my eyes to see my mom standing in my doorway, silent and not moving. I almost squealed. 

“Mom?” I asked, fear crawling up my throat, and squinting. I couldn’t even hear her breath. “Goodnight, mom.” I said forcefully, which I thought I was going to catch flak for in the morning. My mom steps back, and closes my door, where I promptly fell asleep.

She made no mention of my tone the next day or tried to explain why she was staring at me from my doorway in the AM. 

Soon after that incident, it happened like clockwork. My door opening at 12am, my mom spookily staring at me, and me forcefully telling her “goodnight, mom.” 

The reason I’m writing this now, at the breakfast table, shaking and feeling frozen is what happened last night. 

We were all home last night. Like usual, I woke up at 12am to my mom in my doorway, staring and not moving. Except, after I told her a forceful goodnight, she stepped into my room, sparking a shot of unease down my body.

“Mom?” I inquired, my voice wavering. “Goodnight!” I repeated, hopefully as forcefully as I meant it to be. She steps forward again, bringing the absurdity of the situation full force to my sleep deprived brain. I force myself up, and stare directly into my mom’s…dull eyes.

“Mom, seriously, goodnight,” I deadpan, my fingers curled into my soft blankets. Before I could open my mouth again to tell her to leave, she stands up ramrod straight and backs out of my room, her dull gaze still locked on my now awake eyes. My door pulls shut as she finally passed over the line of my doorway. 

So, obviously, I didn’t sleep a wink that night, and stared at pictures and GIFS of baby animals, hoping to erase the dead stare from my brain. 

When it was time for breakfast the next morning, I was ready to confront my mom. 

Sometimes we all play silly little scary pranks on each other (especially my dad and Wendell) but what happened last night REALLY went over the line. 

My dad and brothers were in a lively debate about something as I collect a plate and sit down, looking at all of them and zoning out for a hot minute.

“What’s wrong, Cat?” My mom asked me, concern crossing her face. 

“The prank you played on me wasn’t that fun, mom. It really really scared me. It would be cool if you could stop checking in on me at 12 am, as well.” I said, moody and tired. 

“Cat,” My mom’s voice intoned worriedly, making even dad and the boys stop their conversation and look up. 

“I haven’t checked in on you or the boys since you and Wendell were thirteen.”",1585699665.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsol6s/my_mom_checks_in_on_me_when_i_sleep/
fspsml,fainting--goat,How to Survive Camping: a place without shadows,119,nosleep,https://redd.it/fspsml,32,"If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re just lost in general this might [help you out](https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/#stories).

[As promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fs3i2c/how_to_survive_camping_rule_10_the_thing_in_the/), here’s how it all ended. The buyer was dead, the agreement was void, and now I was trapped *inside* the thing in the dark with my mortal enemy.

For a moment, I was at a loss on what to do.  I hadn’t thought this through because, well, I didn’t think I’d *need* to, on account of being dead and all.  The man with no shadow had no intention of dying just yet, however.

“How about a truce for today?” he said from behind me.  “We’ll both get out of here and then tomorrow we can go back to trying to kill each other.  I stabbed you, your friend shot me, I think we’re even.”

“You’re helpless here, aren’t you?  There are no shadows.”

A long pause and then he admitted that yes, he was.  But neither could I hurt him.  In fact, he said reluctantly, without shadows he couldn’t interact with the corporal world at all.  He existed - and he touched my hand to illustrate his point - but he couldn’t influence it.  No matter how he tried, he couldn’t, say, force me to budge with a shove.  His tone was flat as he told me this but I felt this was humiliating for him, to be forced to admit his weaknesses.  I asked why he was telling me this.

“Because I need you to realize I’m harmless,” he replied in frustration, “so that you don’t waste time trying to get rid of me.  I might need someone that can interact with the physical world to get out of here.”

“And why would I need you?”

“Do you think you can find the way out?”

I was about to answer that yes, I could, but then I hesitated.  My initial thought had been to simply follow the right-hand rule until I found the exit, but this was not a maze.  This was the body of the thing in the darkness.  I could hardly hope to navigate the veins of my own body and find a way out, after all.  The man with no shadow told me, with a calm I certainly did not share, that while he couldn’t guarantee we’d escape, he could at least lead us to the creature’s mouth.  He sensed it.  The head and the heart - the domains of thought and life.  They were things that creatures like him knew on instinct, honing in on them much like a cat hones in on the scent of a mouse.

So I agreed.  We had an uneasy truce.  I might have been willing to die in the woods but now I wasn’t so convinced that I wanted to spend what time was left to me wandering the corridors of some unspeakable creature with my worst enemy until I perished of thirst.

I wouldn’t make a good martyr.

We walked along in relative quiet.  I kept one hand against the side of the corridor, my fingers sliding from rib to rib.  The flesh was woven branches and dry leaves.  Small bits of debris cracked under my feet as I walked.  Not all of it was wood.  Small bones, mostly, from rabbits or squirrels.  Sometimes my feet slipped on something larger, perhaps a deer, and there were a handful that felt like they could be human.

“I don’t suppose you’d tell me what you’re trying to do,” I said, “seeing as I still have a shot at killing you.  But will you tell me if you’ve harmed the lady with extra eyes, like you said you would?”

“Not yet.  I intend to kill her though, once you’re dead.  I don’t understand your affection for her.”

“That’s because to you, everyone is a tool to be used and discarded,” I muttered.

He made a soft noise of disgust.  

“And the black sheep?” I asked.  “Are you willing to tell me who that is?  I’m sure you’re aware that I accused my own brother already.  *Is* it him?  Or was the buyer not as naive as I thought?”

He laughed.  

“I love how paranoid you are!” he crowed.  “Delightful.  No, it’s not family.  It’s the print shop owner.  The idiot was dropping off your order of campground rule pamphlets a few years back and I was there waiting for him.”

Well that’s fucking ironic.

“The buyer *was* under my control,” the man with no shadow sighed.  “I wouldn’t leave such an important piece up to chance.  I just didn’t exert overt influence.  It was subtle.  Suggestions, here and there, so that he didn’t realize it and so that it wasn’t apparent to others.  Trickier to manage, but I had to keep you fooled.”

I didn’t want to admit that he’d succeeded, so I said nothing at all.  We walked a bit further.  I had to pause and catch my breath, pressing a hand to the spot just below my ribs where the man with no shadow had stabbed through my shadow.  He remarked that perhaps I wasn’t as resilient as he’d thought and he’d have to take care not to kill me prematurely, when he had me in his grove.  Not until he was satisfied that I’d suffered enough.

“Shut up,” I hissed.

He started to speak, some other petty, cutting comment, and then he obligingly did as I asked.  

He heard the noise too.  The crack of branches from ahead of us.  I shrank into the recess between ribs, my back against the matted debris.  I felt the man with no shadow crouch at my back, his hands resting lightly on my shoulders, and he quietly whispered in my ear that it was a human approaching, but that perhaps it’d be best to let it continue on past us.

I held still, scarcely daring to breathe.  Their footsteps drew closer and then they stopped entirely and for a moment all I could hear was labored, halting breathing.  Then bony fingers latched onto my wrist.

I shrieked and jerked away, thrashing and twisting in an attempt to throw them off.  Their grip was unrelenting and they drew closer, I could smell the stink of them - stale sweat and rot - and then their fingertips caressed my face, feeling the flesh of my cheek and the line of my jaw.  

“Please,” a female voice croaked, raspy with disuse.  “Help me.  I’ve been here for so long.”

One of my lost campers.

“She’s not begging you to save her,” the man with no shadow said coldly from a safe distance away.  The asshole had abandoned me the moment she grabbed my wrist.  “She wants to die.”

“How do you know?”

“I know her thoughts.  I know everyone’s thoughts.  I know you want to kill me.”

“You can read minds?” I asked suspiciously, still trying to pry her fingers off my wrist.  She continued to beg for help, an endless litany of ‘please’.

“I can if the thoughts are broadcast loud enough.  You *really* want me dead and she *really* wants to die.”

I reached up and seized her by the shoulders.  She finally let go of my wrist and fell silent, reduced to a trembling, shaking wretch before me in the darkness.  Her skin was stretched tight across her bones, like even her very muscles had wasted away.  

“How long have you been here?” I asked.

“I know you,” she finally replied, her voice soft with wonder.  “You tried to save me.”

“You followed the lights.”

I… don’t even want to do the math on how many years she’s been here.  Too many.  This was what I faced, I realized with horror.  This is what would happen if we didn’t escape.  Condemned to wander the body of the thing in the dark for eternity as my body shriveled for want of water and food and light.

“Okay,” I exhaled.  “Come with us.  We’re going to get out of here.”

“This is a mistake,” the man with no shadow muttered from behind us as we started walking again.  “Sentiment only gets you hurt.  Haven’t you realized that by now?”

I coaxed more information from the young woman as we walked.  There were others, she said, wandering in the dark.  Some had given up and lay down and stopped moving and in time the wood and the leaves covered them up.  They weren’t dead, she said.  She’d found one, cocooned into the wall, and she put her hand through the branches and felt their breathing and the beat of their heart.  This wasn’t what she wanted to become, so she kept moving.  Constantly.  Always moving, always searching for a way *out*.  And her breathing grew quicker and I went silent for a little while so that her panic could subside enough for her to remain coherent.  The man with no shadow gave us directions when we came to forks in the corridors and sometimes he hesitated or even told us to turn around and take the other passage.

One of them had tried to kill her, she said.  He hadn’t been here long and was mindless in his terror.  He wasn’t himself and he’d lunged at her and she sidestepped, knowing how to navigate this darkness better than he.  And then she’d shoved him, into the wall, and wrenched a sharp length of wood from the ribs and stabbed him through the stomach with it.  He’d remained there, pinned to the interlaced branches, and then they grew to cover him up and muffled his screams.  Sometimes she found herself in that corridor again, by accident.  She knew it because she could still hear him screaming from his tomb.

Sometimes, she said in a small voice, she would sit and listen to his cries just to hear another human voice for a little while.

She wanted to die so this would end.  But just as he couldn’t die, neither could she.  She was already trapped in a body that should have died a thousand times over from deprivation and some horrific power kept her bound inside her bones.

I dropped back a few paces so that I could talk to the man with no shadow.

“Do you think she’ll die as soon as we escape this thing?” I whispered.

“Probably.  But that’s what she wants.”

I was quiet.  I wanted to disagree.  I wanted to save her, like I’d failed to do so many years ago.  Yet after so long in the darkness… perhaps there is no way to come back from this.  Perhaps if I were trapped for so long I would feel the same.

“You’re afraid,” the man with no shadow said.

“Reading my thoughts again?” I snapped.

“I don’t need to in order to realize that.  I *will* find the head of our captor, Kate.  And then you get us out.”

He told us to turn again and then stopped.  He asked me to put my hands against the wall and tell him what I felt.  I swept my palms along it, to the left and right, then up and down, and when I reached up - I felt a ledge.  My heart sank.  This maze was in three dimensions.  But the man with no shadow sounded more confident now, saying that this was why he kept getting turned around, and maybe we could make some *real* progress now.  I boosted the young woman up first and then she turned and helped pull me up into the tunnel.  Then I reached down for the man with no shadow.  He was as light as a feather and it took almost no effort at all to pull him up after us.

Then we kept going.  Onwards and up along the slope until it opened into a new passageway.  Our progress was better now that the man with no shadow understood more of what we were looking for.  I hate to say it, but I do think we wouldn’t have found our way out without him.  We had a few more passageways leading up, one so steep we had to half-climb, pulling ourselves from rib to rib.  Then the man with no shadow warned us that we were going to pass by the heart of the creature.  

“What’s in the heart?” the young woman asked.

“I have no idea and no desire to find out,” he replied tersely.  “Those places aren’t meant for… lessor… creatures like myself and certainly not for mortals.”

It was tense going after that.  I was on edge, every part of me straining to hear some sort of sound other than the snap of branches and bones beneath our feet, and fearing that I would.  Then my hand slipped off the rib and found only empty air beyond.  The man with no shadow said to keep going and I stepped out into the open space, expecting to find another rib just a few paces beyond.  Nothing.  This passageway was wider than the others.  I opened my mouth to warn the others and tell them to move to the other side of the tunnel when a whispering raced up out of that gulf and I froze.  Like the rustle of leaves.

The ground beneath me shifted.  I let out a cry of surprise and then everything was sliding, the leaves and the bones and the branches rolling and tumbling under my feet and I went down and slid with them, the carpet beneath me turning into a river of debris.  It pulled me down into the hallway and then everything stopped.  I tumbled a few more feet and hastily picked myself up, listening intently, hearing only the startled cries of the young woman and the swearing of the man with no shadow as they came after me.  For a moment, everything was still.

Then the floor began to slide again.  I lunged this time and my hands closed on a rib.  I put one arm over it, locking my body in place as the floor rushed past me, drawn inexorably further down the tunnel towards what I now realized was a vast, empty chamber.

The heart was beating.  Drawing everything in towards it.

And then I realized that I could *see*.  There was light coming from the heart.  Pale gray, diffuse, but light nonetheless and more than enough for my sun-starved eyes.

I turned to look inside once the floor settled in the lull between heartbeats.  

The beast waited for me.

The one that will someday kill me.

I saw the glow of its white eyes in the darkness.  I felt its presence, felt its patient desire.  

Whenever someone goes missing I know that the thing in the dark swallowed them up because I dream of the beast.  I dream of my death.  And that was what waited for me inside its heart.

The lost camper reached me first.  She slammed into the wall, having kept her feet despite the shifting terrain.  Her fingers clawed at the rib, she couldn’t find purchase, and then she slid back towards the heart and I reached out and her hand closed on mine.  My arm trembled to hold onto the rib, keeping us both anchored there, then the floor’s flow slowed and stopped.

I saw her face.  White like bone, impossibly hollow with hunger, lips cracked and peeling, her eyes narrowed against the light.  Her hair was almost gone, just a few tattered patches clinging to her scalp.  

“Grab hold of the wall,” I urged her, panting with exertion.  “That heart is going to beat again.”

She looked back at the archway and the chamber beyond.  The beast waited for me, its double set of eyes opening and closing as it blinked patiently, knowing it was only a matter of time before I died under its claws.  My heart pounded painfully in my chest.

“There’s nothing in there,” she said.

She resisted my hold, stepping towards the heart.  I tightened my grip around her hand, crushing it between my fingers in desperation.  The heart would beat again soon and she’d fall away and I’d lose her like I lost her years ago.  I yelled at her to please, grab hold, don’t do this to me again.  Not again.  I was so tired of losing people.  I couldn’t watch her die.

And she looked up at me and I saw that this was what she was yearning for, it was exactly as the man with no shadow said, and she saw nothing inside the heart because there was no death that she feared.

A heartbeat.

And I let her go.  

She half-fell, half-ran into the heart, and it swallowed her up and there was a burst of light, like the birth of a star, and I shut my eyes tight against the brilliance.

A hand closed on my arm.  The man with no shadow, given form by the presence of light, and he pulled at me, yelling that I had to move, that we had to get away from it before it pulled us in as well.  So we did.  We fought our way up.  There was a cadence now.  I flattened my body to the wall against a rib and waited for the river of debris to pass and for the floor to grow calm and then I ran forwards until I heard that whispering approaching from the chamber behind me, telling me to seek an anchor once more.  And the entire time the man with no shadow didn’t let go of me, refusing to lose me to the beast that waited inside the heart, just as he refused to lose me to the little girl.

We emerged into the t-intersection and threw ourselves to the side, huddling against the wall in a recess between spars.  The heart whispered and the debris beneath us shifted, but faintly, and only a few pieces rattled their way into the passageway.  I watched them dance and roll in the light cast by the heart.  I was too numb to even weep for her death.

“*Twice*,” the man with no shadow snarled.  “This makes *twice* I saved you.  The pleasure of killing you with my own hands had better make up for this.”

I had no indication of what he was going to do, not until there was a wrenching sensation in my side and then blinding pain.  I remember screaming and then I remember nothing and then I was flat on my back, waking to pain, disoriented and feeling like I would slip away back into the darkness at the slightest movement.  It hurt to breathe.  Like one of my lungs was filled with fire.  I took shallow, halting breaths, and my eyes filled with tears.

“You should still be able to walk,” the man with no shadow said calmly, standing over me.  “I can be precise when I want to.”

“Why…?” I moaned.

“I only need you alive to get out of here,” he replied grimly.  “I don’t need you *whole* and you are far less of a threat with a maimed shadow.  Now get up.  I’ve dragged you as far as I can.  The light is gone again.”

I didn’t.  Not right away.  The man with no shadow sighed and crouched nearby.  I heard the rustle of his clothing.  He told me that certainly, I could lie there and wish for death, but we’d both seen that death wouldn’t come here, hadn’t we?  Besides, that wasn’t in my nature.  He’d made some mistakes in all of this; no plan went flawlessly.  But his biggest mistake had been underestimating my capacity to keep fighting even when I should have given up long ago.

As he spoke, my fingers curled on a piece of bone.  It’d broken in two, leaving behind a jagged end.  I slipped this into my belt as I got up, letting the noise of my struggles to stand mask the sound of me concealing it.

Yes.  I was still willing to fight.

I struggled onward, guided by the man with no shadow’s directions.  I needed light in order to kill him, after all, and for that I needed to escape.  That was the mantra that kept me going.  I needed light to kill him.  I called myself prey in a prior post, but prey can still fight back, even to its last breath.  Weakened by pain and injury, I drove myself forwards, fighting that urge to sink back to the ground because I knew that if I rested even for a moment I might not get back up again.  The bone stake I carried with me was what kept me going.  It and the promise it represented.  One last chance to fight back.

The passageway sloped upwards.  A long, gradual climb, but one that left me drained nonetheless.  I stumbled the last few steps through the widening mouth and into an open space that echoed with my ragged breathing.  The head of the thing in the dark, the man with no shadow whispered to me.  Just as he’d promised.

“Now,” he murmured and made no effort to disguise his malice, “it’s your turn.  Beg it to let us go.”

“That’s your plan?” I gasped, shaking with exhaustion.

“It’s all I have.  You’re the campground manager.  It might actually listen to you.”

I didn’t ask what we’d do if this failed.  I knew the answer.  We’d wander the corridors, desperately seeking a way out, until our will broke and we sought the heart and the death that waited for us within.  I wondered what was waiting for the man with no shadow.  What kind of death he feared.

“Hello?” I called into that vast emptiness.  “It’s Kate.  I’m here.  You swallowed me up.”

I held my breath and waited.  Silence.

“I’ve tried to do what you told me,” I continued, my voice trembling in desperation.  “I’ve tried to get others to do the same.  But we make mistakes and all I can offer is a plea for you to release me, so that I can keep trying.”

The ground beneath us lurched.  I stumbled and fell and then a body landed across my legs; the man with no shadow, cursing under his breath.

The thing in the dark was waking up.

Its voice came from all around us.

“You gave me a home,” it rumbled.  “You gave the land near me to people who are kind.  They leave me offerings in the summer, of food and drink, of which I cannot partake but it is an offering nonetheless.”

The senior camp.  They had an excellent cook who also brewed her own beer.  Of course.

“I forgive this transgression,” it continued.  “Just this once.”

The blackness in front of me split open and light poured in - sunlight, and after the hours of darkness it brought tears of pain and relief to my eyes.  An opening yawned in front of me like the mouth of a cave, jagged with branches and roots like teeth.  I saw the blurry outlines of trees beyond, shining in the light.  We were inside the thing in the dark’s mouth, I realized.  I stumbled forwards and a hand seized my arm.  The man with no shadow was by my side, his fingers digging into my flesh, and his face tight with fear.  He stayed close to my side and I realized this was why he wanted me alive, so that he could slip out unnoticed with me.  But the thing in the dark was not naive and it had its own designs.

“You I do not forgive,” the thing rumbled and I felt liquid trickle out of my right ear as I lost all hearing in it.

Behind us, the branches and leaves whispered and converged, rolling into a ridge and then they engulfed the man with no shadow’s feet.  He jerked, like a fish on a line, and toppled as the thing in the dark began to drag him back into its maw.  He screamed in incandescent rage and threw out his hands and even though I tried to step away, I was weak and slow, and his grip closed on my leg.  I began to slide, being pulled back into the darkness, and the opening before us began to close.  The thing in the dark was not a patient creature and it would only afford me one chance to claim my freedom.

The weak perish.  There is no mercy here in the forest.

I twisted.  I seized the bone from where it rested in my belt.  And the man with no shadow’s eyes widened with horror as he realized my intention, but it was too late, he was already holding on with both hands while the carpet of branches and leaves continued to engulf him, already covering his body up to his knees.

I drove the sharp end of the bone through where the shadow of his wrists would land.

He screamed and I jerked hard on my leg and was free.  Then I was half-running, half-crawling towards the narrowing gap, and I grabbed hold of the broken half of a tree and pulled myself through, squeezing between its teeth, and then I rolled down the mound and came to a rest on the damp soil of the forest.

Beside me sat the mound that housed the thing in the dark.  It was silent and still but for a moment, I thought I could hear the man with no shadow.  Screaming.  

I think it was only my imagination.

I believe I fainted after that.

I next remember being carried.  There were arms under my shoulders and under my knees and when I looked down at them, there were plain metal rings around the fingers.  I slipped away again and next awoke in my own bed.  The old sheriff was there.  He said he’d been keeping watch over the house in case I came back, while Bryan searched the forest with the dogs.  He told me it was almost sundown.  I’d been missing for most of the day.

I told him the man with no shadow was gone.  Then I had him bring me my laptop and I began to type all this up, before the details began to fade.

Today I saw the doctor.  I have a few scrapes from my falls, but otherwise my only serious injury is my shadow and they can’t do anything about that.  If I stand in front of a wall I can see clearly how much the man with no shadow tore away.  An entire lung would be gone, had he attacked my corporal body.  I don’t like looking at it.  I’m weak and I’m winded easily, but I’ll recover in time.  I still can’t hear out my right ear, either.  My eardrum ruptured from the thing in the dark’s voice, but it will heal.  It’s actually ruptured before from infection, when I was a child, so the scar tissue was what split open again.

Otherwise, I’ve been spending my time today resting and recovering.  I made some calls to the people in town who were in that grove.  They remember what happened.  They heard the man with no shadow call them and tell them to come to the campground, so they did.  Some were told to come with a gun, and they did.  I told them the man with no shadow was gone, to assure them they were safe, and they said that they knew.  Somehow, they knew.  Not dead.  Just… gone.  Like a weight was off their shoulders.

I keep thinking about how the thing in the dark refused to let him go.  It’s been bothering me as to why.  I’ve never had any indication that the thing in the dark was anything other than indifferent towards the other creatures it shared the campground with.  Then, after I got done calling the people in town… I realized why it had been angry.  

I’d recognized one of the campers that was in that grove with a gun held to their head.  I don’t know a lot of campers.  They all tend to blur together over time.  But this one, I know this one because they’re one of the special ones that I see more than others and have a reason to stand out in my mind.  They’re part of the senior camp, the one that I put next to the thing in the dark because I know they’ll be careful not to disturb it.

They're one of the people that leave offerings.  And the man with no shadow would have killed them.  He knew what he’d done.  That’s why he needed me alive.

On one hand, I am intensely grateful there was one of the senior camp among those the man with no shadow was going to kill.  I’m not sure if the thing in the dark would have dragged him back into the darkness otherwise.  On the other hand… out of everyone that camps here, they should *really* have known better than to talk to him.

We all make mistakes, I guess.

I called a family meeting today to update everyone on the situation.  My brother was there.  He rarely attends.  I apologized for keeping everyone ignorant as to the full scope of the situation, but explained that we were dealing with something that could manipulate minds and it was hard to tell who to trust.  My brother looked put-out at that, but I suppose that’s understandable.  I think him being at the meeting at all was his way of saying I was forgiven.  

Then one of my cousins spoke up with something that would have been really nice to know *years* ago.  (okay they’re actually a second cousin but I have a lot of those and a lot of cousins and you’re not here to listen to genealogy so I’m just going to call them all cousins and leave it at that) 

She did 23andMe a while back and found a relative we didn’t know about.  Yes.  The buyer.  She thought it would be wonderful to connect with this side of the family and arranged for him to come out to the campsite.  My cousin admitted that she was remiss in not telling him the rules before he came.  She thought it would be safe if he was only here for a few hours, but she didn’t think about how my entire family, no matter how distantly related, are targets.  But he never showed.  And he never answered any of her messages and she assumed he’d chickened out and was now ghosting her.

I think we can fill in the blanks from there.  He reached the campsite and the man with no shadow greeted him.  They had a conversation.

I wonder if my cousin was *also* under the man with no shadow’s influence or if this was just a happy coincidence for him.  Regardless, there’s a new rule for the family.  No more 23andMe.  No more ancestry ANYTHING.  We don’t need to be bringing more surprise relatives here that don’t know what they’re getting into.

I’m a campground manager.  I’ve still got a lot of work to do.  I’m not convinced that getting rid of the man with no shadow is going to keep this from being a bad year.  I’m going to be wary.  I’m going to keep watching and doing whatever I can to keep my town and my campers safe.  I’m going to keep telling you about my land and my rules and why they exist.  It’s spring, after all, and it’s time to open my campground.

You should come visit.

And this year, when I send out my “how to survive camping” pamphlets with the list of rules, they will be shorter by two.  The not-brother is dead.  And the man with no shadow will never escape.

fsl117,girl_from_the_crypt,Working at an amusement park: I hitched a ride on the Stagecoach today,1224,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsl117,126,"I work at an amusement park where only half of the actors are actual actors. I think I've mentioned a couple times [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/frywfc/working_at_an_amusement_park_firewater/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that I am a huge fan of wild west movies. This is probably why I'm so fascinated by the Stagecoach. 

My daydreams about this gorgeous carriage usually involve steering it, sitting inside of it and being driven around or even riding on top of its roof like the Laughing Cowboy. I really am a bit envious of him about that. Ever since I first saw the Stagecoach, I just wanted to ride it so badly, be it only once. 

Well, it seems this dream of mine has finally become sweet, sweet reality today. And I paid the price for it alright.

My chest and stomach hurt like hell... but it was worth it.

Let me explain.

Before getting on my way to work today, I went down to the small convenience store on my street to purchase a few things I would need that same day. The store is tiny and run by a grumpy, chubby older dude with a gray beard who always wears a Panama hat. It has this musty, stale feel to it, but I sort of like it. Plus, the clerk and I like to joke around sometimes. I think he was even rather happy to see me today since I can hardly imagine he's been getting a lot of customers lately.

I was the only one in the store, except for the owner of course. I collected a few candy bars from the shelves and carried them over to the cash register. I then proceeded to inspect the array of cigarrets and other tobacco products lined up in front of the clerk before picking out a colorful metal box of chewing tobacco and adding it to my pile of junk food. 

The clerk looked me up and down with mild surprise. ""Usually the only thing you buy here are protein bars and soda,"" he remarked. 

""They say the only constant is change,"" I replied.

The bearded man grunted amusedly before beginning to ring up my purchases. When he reached the box of chewing tobacco, he held it up to study it. ""Gettin' a little something for your man, huh?"" he presumed.

""Way off, I want it for myself. I can't get enough of it,"" I said jokingly and the clerk chuckled and shook his head. When he had bagged all of my items, I went back to my apartment to get my whip and remaining necessities before stopping by at my neighbor's place to ask for some more laurel. I have decided to keep experimenting with it. 

I set out for the park with one clear goal in mind: to talk to Nathan.
I felt a bit like a stalker, the way I snuck up to the entrance sign of Twin Vale Point after tending to the sock puppet at six in the morning. I could hear the sounds of the oncoming carriage in the distance. I waited by the town entrance for the horses to come into sight. As soon as they did, I began waving at Nathan, who was sitting in his coach seat as always. I swear I could see him roll his eyes even from half a mile away. 

The coachman sure wasn't happy to see me. That didn't stop me though. I ran up to him and came to a halt right in front of the horses, forcing him to stop so as to not run me over. I smiled at him and made my way over to where he was sitting.

""Hi,"" I said.

""Hello,"" he replied dryly.

""Are you a little more willing to talk to me now by any chance?"" I asked. 

Nathan leaned over to me, the smell of his blanket instantly penetrating my nostrils. ""Look at my face and tell me yourself,"" he growled. 

""You look like you wish you hadn't stopped the Stagecoach just now,"" I remarked.

Nathan grimaced. ""Wow. Here I was thinking you had no self-awareness. I didn't know you were simply ignoring it.""

""You sound a bit like Dale,"" I commented. 

Nathan's reaction to my manager's name was instantaneous. His expression darkened and for a second, I thought his face would scrunch up like that of a baby and he would start to cry. Instead, he just swallowed audibly before cracking the reins and shouting at his horses to start moving again.

I sighed and sat down by the entrance sign. He drives around in circles, so I knew he'd have to come by again eventually. I found myself wishing for company. Maybe Darius or Mitchell would come by soon. Or better yet, one of the other girls. It had been a while since the last time I had privately talked to Anne or Maxine.

I sat and waited for about fifteen minutes before the sound of horseshoes clacking guided me out of my thoughts. I stood up and casually walked up to the approaching Stagecoach. Nathan looked even more annoyed to see me this time. 

""Would some chocolate change your mind? I brought some junk food from home,"" I called out to him, shrugging the backpack I was wearing off my shoulders. ""You've got to be hungry, right?""

Nathan groaned. ""Damn, you're persistent.""

I nodded. Nathan puffed. ""Leave me alone. I mean it. No clue what you want to know, but I probably won't be able to tell you.""

""Let's try it then! Come on, please,"" I begged, but Nathan just shook his head and set the carriage into motion again.

Another round of waiting until once again, the carriage came rolling up to me. I rose to my feet. This time, Nathan stopped the Stagecoach right next to where I was standing. He stared at me calculatingly for a moment before nodding at the empty space beside him on the coachseat. ""Hop on,"" he ordered curtly.

""You mean it?""

Nathan rolled his eyes and nodded. ""Quick, before I change my mind.""

He didn't have to tell me twice. I climbed onto the Stagecoach and sat down next to him. 

""I'd hold onto my seat if I were you,"" Nathan told me before cracking the reins and shouting, ""Giddy up!""

The horses neighed and began trotting off. The carriage bucketed jerkily over the sandy, bumpy ground. I could hardly believe it, I was actually *on* the Stagecoach. And it felt *awesome*.

""So, what about the sudden change of heart?"" I inquired, trying hard to keep my cool.

""You would've just kept waiting anyways. Best to just get it over with,"" Nathan explained. ""Also, this is what you always wanted, isn't it? Don't pretend. I see you watch the carriage all day, you know.""

I let out a flustered chuckle. ""True. I guess I'm a bit of a fan.""

For a split second, I thought I could see a smile appear and quickly vanish again on the coachman's face. ""It's not that great when you're the one driving it,"" he muttered with downcast eyes before looking up at me again. ""So. What do you know?""

Swallowing down my apprehension, I began. ""I know for sure that this park is family-run. I also know that something really messed up is happening to you and I want to help. Then there's some stuff I believe I know but am not fully certain about.""

""What would that be?"" Nathan sounded calm, but stern. 

""I had a conversation with Dale yesterday. He was... very much intoxicated. He didn't make a lot of sense so I had to piece together what little snippets he gave me."" I took a deep breath. ""I think you and Dale used to be quite fond of one another, but then for some reason, he gave you the task of driving the Stagecoach. I believe you're turning into a not-actor... or rather becoming one with this one here.""

Nathan leaned back in his seat and pulled the smelly blanket closer around his shoulders. ""That last part... it's true. All of it. But I don't know any more either.""

""You don't?"" I was a bit taken aback. He sounded like he was telling the truth, but I had somehow expected him to have way more insight. ""Will you still tell me what you know?""

""Not sure if it'll be of much help."" Nathan regarded me with a sad smile. 

""I insist,"" I said sternly. ""It *will* help, I'm sure of it.""

The coachman's grip on the horses' reins tightened and he let out a soft sigh. ""You said you had candy?""

I nodded and opened my backpack, pulling out a chocolate bar at random. I unwrapped it before handing it to him. The young man took a large bite out of it and began chewing. His expression softened. ""Thanks. I didn't have anything sweet since... I don't know, to be honest. It's been that long since I last got off of the Stagecoach. I don't really need to eat at all anymore. Still nice having something that tastes good though.""

I felt myself becoming excited in light of what I was about to hear, but decided not to interrupt him. Better let him take his time.

""Dale and I first met in high school, but we were just friends then. Later, years after both of us had graduated, we reconnected and decided to get some coffee together. We hit it off right away and that's kind of how we became a thing.

He was fascinating to me. He was always so emotional and contemplative. He was a bit of a mystery too. So sweet though. Really, really caring and sweet. I had never felt safer with anyone else before. Dale truly cared about me. He never made a big deal about it either, it was just natural for him to be there for me whenever I needed him.

He had just taken over his dad's job as park manager and I was unemployed, so he got me a job as a waiter here at the park. It might seem weird to you that my boss was my boyfriend as well, but it was all pretty great. We were happy during that time, like, really happy. Until one day, he waited for me outside the restaurant I worked at after closing hours. He had tears in his eyes. He tried to hide it, but he looked incredibly sad. I asked him what was wrong, but he told me it was nothing and that he needed to tell me I was going to do another job at the park from now on. He said I was going to be an actor.

I asked him why and he told me he had gotten instructions to have me change jobs and that he had to follow them. See, I didn't know why he was so sad. I mean, it was strange, sure, but I didn't get why he was crying. He asked me to drop the subject and we went home. Back then, I used to live with him, you know. Even at home he was acting all strange and depressed and I didn't know what had gotten into him, I was worried sick. Anyways, I had promised to drop it so I didn't dare to ask any further questions.

Instead, I did my best to take care of him. Dale's always been so sensitive. I remember telling him that whatever he was feeling so down about, we would work it out together and that he could count on me. His response... I remember it like it was yesterday. He told me he knew and that that was why he was so sorry. He kept begging me for forgiveness. It was beyond confusing. 

The next day he led me to the Stagecoach. I had seen it around before. It used to have another coachman, but he was gone all of a sudden. Never saw him around again by the way. Dale told me he had quit, but I have my doubts. He said that I would be the new coachman and when I told him I had never driven a carriage before, he simply said I'd learn it by myself in no time. He was right about that by the way.

Then he just suddenly pulled out a bottle of coke and handed it to me. He told me he had gotten it for me as a refreshment so naturally, I thanked him and started drinking it. The moment I took the first swig from it though, Dale started to weep. Like, really horrible, heart-breaking crying. I instantly attempted to comfort him. He was completely inconsolable though. 

We sat down on the coachseat together and I hugged him while he cried. I finished up the soda few minutes later. I remember thinking it tasted weird. When Dale noticed I had emptied it, he took the bottle and stared at it for a while. *""I'm so terribly sorry,""* he'd whispered. I was still taken aback, but I told him I loved him and then he kissed me. That was... that was the last time we ever talked.

It didn't occur to me he had poisoned me until later. I trusted him, I would have trusted him with my life. So when I started convulsing and everything began to spin around me, I was still like, *it can't be, it can't be, he'd never hurt me.* I had to face it though when I found myself unable to leave the seat of the carriage. I would instantly start to feel sick again whenever I did.

At first, I was still able to leave for the bathroom and to eat from time to time, but I felt it getting harder and harder day by day. As if it was slowly progressing. From the very first day, I found myself unable to leave the park. After two years, I wasn't able to leave Twin Vale Point. And then, three years ago, shortly before you started working here, I noticed that I wasn't getting thirsty or hungry anymore.

From then on, everytime I got off the Stagecoach for any other reason then to mind the horses or the carriage in any way, it started to hurt. It hurt so, so much that I just... *stopped.*"" Nathan looked up at me with tear-filled eyes. ""I don't know why Dale did this to me. I'm sure he didn't want to. Someone forced him to do it, but I don't know who or how or why or..."" his voice trailed off. ""That's all I know. I've tried making sense of all of this more times than I can count, but it doesn't matter anymore.""

""It does matter! I'll get you out of here,"" I promised. ""I've been working on figuring out a bunch of stuff! Once I've gotten it all together, I'll know a way to help you! Just hang in there, okay?""

Nathan smiled softly and shook his head. ""No. I appreciate it, but it's too late for me."" His voice had grown very quiet all of a sudden as he said, ""I'm never leaving here.""

I opened my mouth to protest but he shushed me. ""I mean it,"" he whispered. The horses came to an easy halt and the coachman lowered the reins, pinning them between his knees as his hands reached up to slowly remove the smelly blanket draped around his shoulders. 

The shirt he was wearing underneath was old, stained and wrinkly. He moved his hands up to unbutton it, revealing his chest. At first, I thought his skin looked like it had suffered a severe sunburn, but the closer I inspected it, the more I realized that amongst the innumerable large blisters, parts of it were overlapping as if they had molten into each other. It looked grotesque and strange, but above all else, extremely painful.

""When did this happen?"" I muttered.

""It spreads everytime I get off the Stagecoach,"" he explained as he buttoned up his shirt and once again wrapped the blanket around himself. I imagined the secretions from the blisters popping trickling into its fabric and couldn't help but gag slightly. 

""There has to be some way of stopping it,"" I professed, feeling a hint of desperation in my own voice.

""I don't think there is,"" Nathan replied as picked up the reins again. ""You know,"" he confessed as the carriage set into motion again, ""I didn't think I would, but I enjoyed talking to you. It's been a while. I've just lost track of everything over time. As I said, I don't even feel things like thirst or hunger anymore. In fact, I kind of feel... numb. I think that it's part of whatever transformation I'm undergoing here, to stop caring. I've come to terms with it.""

I didn't know what else to say, so I kept quiet for a little while before asking, ""Were Dale's parents against the relationship? It could have been them who forced him to... you know.""

Nathan pondered for a few seconds before shaking his head. ""I don't think so. If they did, they were never open about it. I only met them on very few occasions though, so I'm not sure.""

""Where'd you get the blanket though?""

""I don't know. It was just lying next to me one morning when I woke up. Maybe Dale gave it to me.""

""Any idea what could have been in that soda maybe?""

""No clue. I told you I didn't know much at all about the park. I only know what's happening to me, but that's already it."" After a short pause, he added, ""Would you like to keep me company some more?""

Of course I said yes. After we talked some more about unrelated things, Nathan decided to entertain us by having the horses speed up a little, then a little more and then a lot until we were basically flying over the streets of Twin Vale Point. We were both losing our shit and I was laughing like crazy. It was insanely fun. You'd never believe how fast this carriage could actually go. I felt the cool wind hit my face and tousle my hair. 

As I was saying, I was enjoying myself until I found myself unable to hold on to my seat anymore. At first, Nathan offered me his arm as a means of support, but I had to let go of it soon since it was hindering him in steering the carriage. I felt myself steadily slipping off to the side and I called out to Nathan to slow down, but by the time the horses had taken on a safe pace again, I had already fallen off. 

My contact with the dirty ground was more than painful. I landed flat on my stomach and continued to slide across the street a couple inches, just enough for road pebbles to pierce my shirt and scrape my skin. The impact left a nasty graze on my chin and I later found that there were large bruises along my collarbone as well as around my hips and belly. 

""ARE YOU OKAY?"" I heard Nathan shout, but his voice lost itself in the distance as the horses continued to carry him off.

""I'M FINE!"" I yelled back, hoping he would hear me. I didn't want him to turn back and get off the Stagecoach, knowing what I knew now.

It took me some effort to push myself up from the ground. Groaning and aching, I managed to rise to a sitting position, only to stop and pull up my shirt a little to inspect the burning scratches on my skin. Suddenly, a hand appeared in front of my face. I looked up to find the Laughing Cowboy towering over me. I quickly straightened out my shirt and grabbed his hand so he could pull me to my feet. 

""Hey, just who I was looking for,"" I uttered, my voice still a bit agonized from the fall. ""Say, how come you're always around whenever I need assistance?""

The question was rethorical of course. The cowboy didn't respond, he just smiled and lifted his hat to me before turning around and beginning to walk off. 

""Wait a second!"" 

He halted, allowing me to catch up to him with faltering steps. I took off my backpack and began to rummage around inside until I produced the slim metal box of tobacco. ""I don't know if you like this kind of thing, but I didn't really know what else to get you. I just wanted to give you a little something as thanks for being so nice to me. You helped my clumsy ass out so many times that I've stopped counting already.""

I held the box out to him and he carefully took it from my hands, a pensive look on his face. He eyed it in what looked to be disbelief for a few seconds before tucking it away in one of his pockets. I smiled. We continued to stare at one another and I found myself unsure of what to say. I watched the black saliva trickle from the corner of his mouth. It was almost hypnotic. 

I finally remembered something. Reaching into my backpack, I took out the new laurel twig and held it out for him to see. ""Do you know what this is?"" I asked. 

His eyes widened and without a warning, he raised his hand and smacked the twig out of my grasp. I watched it sail through the air and hit the ground. The cowboy turned back to me, flashed me his typical wide smile before lifting his hat once again and walking off. 

I'm starting to think the pretenders really dislike laurel for some reason. Maybe I should have showed the twig to Nathan too, but after my tumble, I only wanted to get back home. 

I already mentioned that my whole upper body still hurts quite a lot, which is also the reason why I won't go to the park tomorrow. I have tasked Darius with feeding the sock puppet so I can take the day off to recover. I'll still take the time to at least recount one or two of my older job experiences while my investigations are on hold for a bit. 

I'm not entirely sure what to make of my exchange with Nathan. I feel so deeply sorry for him. He may have given up already, but maybe there still is a way to help him after all.

Now I hope you'll excuse me, for I need to go get a fresh cold pack for my chin and shoulder. As I said, it hurts like hell, but the ride on the Stagecoach was *totally worth it*.

frywfc,girl_from_the_crypt,Working at an amusement park: Firewater,2932,nosleep,https://redd.it/frywfc,247,"I work at an amusement park where only half of the actors are actual actors. Some of the suggestions on [yesterday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/frcx7v/working_at_an_amusement_park_mr_scratch/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) really piqued my interest. This is why I decided to take your advice to heart and try out a couple things.

I live in a small apartment located in a larger residence right by a very busy street. The lady who I live door to door with is a friendly older woman with an avid passion for gardening. She keeps a ton of potted plants on her balcony and all throughout her home. I've been over at her place a few times to chat and have lunch together, so I knew she would gladly help me out. 

She sure was surprised to have me knock on her door in the early morning hours and ask if she had any laurel plants. Still, she scurried off into her living room and returned with a greenery sprouting twig which she handed to me with a friendly smile. I thanked her and told her I would explain my strange request someday when I would find the time. 

Before I got on my way to the park, I took out my cell phone and dialed my manager's number. He had given it out to us for emergencies only, but I guess under the given circumstances, I could allow myself a tiny bit of misconduct. Dale picked up almost instantly.

""What happened?"" he asked straight away, his tone surly and annoyed.

""Nothing, listen... Dale, we need to talk.""

""We do, do we?"" he muttered after a long sigh. ""About what?"" he then asked.

""I have some questions... about the pretenders. There are just some things I need to know, I have to..."" my voice trailed off. ""*Please*,"" I added sternly.

""Don't tell me you've been running around behind my back playing detective or some crap,"" he responded in a low, slightly menacing tone.

""No. Of course not,"" I stammered, trying to sound confident. ""Who do you think I think I am?""

""...what?"" Dale sounded a bit confused, but caught himself rather quickly. ""Leah, how many times do I have to tell you not to interfere with other people's business?"" he hissed, but I could sense a hint of desperation in his disgruntled voice. ""Why can't you just do your job and let me do mine?""

""I don't want to interfere with your job in any way. It's just that I've been feeling sort of creeped out lately. It all came crashing down on me one day recently that I don't actually know where the pretenders come from. And what they are. Like, reality check, you know? I only want to know a few things so that I can feel safe working here again,"" I explained, hoping I had sounded emotional enough for him to believe my excuses.

A long pause followed, so long in fact that I already started wondering if he had hung up on me, before he finally answered: ""Okay, fine. I'll meet you at my office today, four pm, do *not* be late. That doesn't mean I'll tell you what you want to know, but we *are* going to have a talk. That's all I can and will do for you. Will you leave me alone from then on?""

""Sure,"" I lied, fiddling excitedly with the laurel twig.

""Why do I have a feeling you won't?"" Dale pondered before giving one final sigh and adding, ""four in the afternoon, my office. See you there."" With that, he ended the call.

When I arrived at the park, Darius was waiting for me by the employee entrance. 

""Hi there,"" he greeted me sleepily before letting out a yawn and, nodding at the twig in my hand, adding, ""What's that about?"" 

""It's laurel,"" I said curtly. 

""Oh! Like, because of the Diva?""

I nodded and the two of us stepped inside, heading for Mr Scratch's repurposed cage. The Nurse was standing inside as if she had not moved at all during our absence. She was staring blankly into the distance as we approached. I placed the laurel twig on the ground before pulling the key to the cage out of my pocket, only to halt mid-motion.

""Hey, let's show her the key, see if she reacts in any way.""

""Okay, sure,"" Darius replied, fumbling for the small object before producing it from within his jacket and holding it out for the Nurse to see. The not-actor continued to voidly gaze past us, not paying any attention to the key.

Darius cleared his throat. ""Hey, uh... remember how you shoved this down my throat?"" he asked more jokingly than serious and I rolled my eyes. Finally, he put away the key and turned back to me. ""You gonna let her out now?""

I nodded affirmatively and stepped forward to unlock the door. The pretender didn't budge. Her eyes were as glazed and empty as always. Darius swallowed audibly as he inched closer to her, reached out and carefully placed his hands on her shoulders. The moment his palms made contact with her body, a low, guttural groan erupted from her throat. He slowly, ever so slowly pulled her out of the shelter.

""Huh,"" he uttered. ""She seems to be all normal again.""

Still on high alert, I picked up my laurel twig once again. Darius and I exchanged concerned glances as he stepped back from the pretender. Once we had both calmed down a bit, I went to get the sock puppet. My colleague watched me feed and pet him and when he had settled back down in his shelter, Darius and I took a seat on the bench nearby to talk and watch over the Nurse who was still standing right beside the funhouse where her handler had walked her over to.

I admit we wasted a lot of time chatting and pretending all was well. It was nice not having to worry about the mystery of the park for once, but come three pm, I remembered my appointment with Dale. *Time to get serious.*

I told Darius about my exchange with Joshua the previous day and what I had found out. I also informed him of my impending meeting with the manager and then asked him to lend me the Nurse's key which he willingly handed to me. 

""I can't believe he'll actually talk to you about the park. Does he know we've been snooping around?"" he inquired.

""Of course not. Well, I do think he has a feeling I might have caught on to some of the odd stuff around here. I believe he only sees me as a curious employee though. And I'm certain he doesn't know anything about the key."" I gave Darius a reassuring smile. ""I'm taking it because it might fit into something inside of his office. I mean, I doubt I'll get the chance to try it, but who knows.""

My colleague nodded sternly. ""Best of luck then, I guess,"" he muttered with a frown. ""Don't... you know. Don't tell on us. Watch what you say."" While this might have sounded like a threat coming from anybody else, Darius' tone was genuinely concerned.

""Don't worry. I will,"" I assured him before setting out for the Hollywood section. There was one more thing I had to do before meeting with Dale. 

I found the Aged Diva sitting on a bench on the main plaza. She was staring up at the sky absentmindedly and almost seemed startled when I sat down beside her. Without saying a word, I pulled out the laurel twig and handed it to her. She took it with her slender, wrinkly fingers and regarded it silently. 

""Is this what you wanted to tell us?"" I asked softly. She didn't respond. Her sudden quiet attitude reminded me a lot of the Nurse. She looked up at me with a blank expression before her lips began to curl into a wide smile.

""Why hello there, dearie! I didn't see you coming,"" she said. 

""Is this place cursed?"" I whispered. ""You wrote down the word *laurel* for us when Oliver and I talked to you yesterday. At first I thought it was your name, but then I found out that laurel, as in bay leaves, can be used to cleanse a place of negativity or to break a curse. Is that what you wanted to tell us? Does the park need cleansing?""

The elderly woman stared at me for a few seconds before suddenly tightening her grip on the delicate, helpless laurel twig and snapping it in half. My jaw dropped as she took both pieces and began breaking them down into smaller and smaller ones, crushing the bright green leaves in the process. She was mumbling something under her breath, her voice steadily growing louder and louder until it rose to a scream.

""That ugly, misshapen brat... that ugly, misshapen brat... that ugly, misshapen brat, THAT UGLY, MISSHAPEN BRAT!"" 

With that, she hurled the tiny pieces of the laurel twig in her hand away from her with all her might. I watched as they flew through the air and hit the ground a small distance ahead of us. The Diva then let out a low gurgle as the corners of her eyes began to droop and her skin started to melt. I didn't stick around to wait for the explosion.

When I arrived at Dale's office, I found the door to be open just a crack. I decided to knock anyways.

""Dale? It's Leah,"" I called out. ""You said we could talk.""

""Come on in,"" my managers voice came from inside. 

I nudged open the door and entered the small room. Dale was sitting at his table, or rather slouching. While I had never thought of him as much of a lively person, he somehow managed to look even more under the weather than usual.

Dale is a shorter, slightly overweight guy with greasy, sand blond hair. I have never seen him clean-shaven and there are always dark bags under his brown eyes. He usually wears long-sleeved shirts and cargo pants, both of which normally way too baggy to be flattering in any way.

""Hello..."" he slurred. ""Have... have a seat."" He pointed at the chair across from him.

I frowned. ""Um... are you drunk?"" I inquired. I didn't really need an answer though seeing as when I approached him and sat down, I spotted the two bottles of whiskey on his desk, one of which had already been emptied halfway.

""A little bit,"" he admitted, covering his mouth to suppress a hiccup. 

""Should I come back another time? When you're more... uh... sober, maybe?"" I offered.

""No, no, you stay right here. You wanted to... to ask me a couple things, right?"" he inquired, seemingly straining himself to appear focused.

""Yes, if you don't mind."" Still a bit uncertain, I straightened up in my chair and cleared my throat. ""But first off, I'd like to know why you're drunk at four in the afternoon.""

Dale looked up at me with bleak eyes. ""Is that really so surprising to you? This is... this is what you truly see me as, isn't it? I'm the asshole boss who sits in his ivory tower sipping champagne... while you and your friends work your asses off.""

""That's whiskey you're having there though,"" I remarked. 

""What? That was a figure of speech. Well, it doesn't matter what it is. What matters is that you don't know shit about me, missy! You think..."" his voice trailed off and he frowned, as if he had forgotten what he had been about to say. ""You think *I*'m the bad guy, but you don't know *shit*,"" he finally added.

It was hard to take him serious. ""Look, Dale, I don't think you're the bad guy. But you have never given me any reason to trust you. All I want is to know whether this place...""

""Fuck this place!"" Dale interrupted me. ""To hell with it! I know you've been going behind my back trying to find out where the pretenders come from! Don't play dumb on me!"" he called out. ""I'm not some... some..."" his voice trailed off and he fumbled for words. ""I just don't fall for it! Doesn't work on me.""

He leaned over to me across the table, close enough for me to smell the stench of alcohol in his breath. ""You know why I don't care though? Because you'll never, *ever* find out the whole truth.""

""So you admit that you're keeping information from your employees,"" I inferred.

Dale let out a high-pitched laugh. ""Oh... oh, you *are* cute... information..."" He lost himself in a fit of giggles. ""Seriously though. You think you know something about what's going on here? You don't. You're barely scraping the tip of the iceberg, this *thing*... this whole thing is way too big for you. No matter how hard you try, you're not gonna get the whole story because I'm the only one who could theoretically tell you and even if I wanted to, I couldn't.""

""Care to explain that to me?""

Dale shook his head. ""No way. Couldn't care less."" His face softened and he once again leaned over to me. ""But there's... one thing I'll give you. Just one small truth and that is that I'm not the bad guy here.""

I swallowed. ""So you're not a threat to me and my co-workers?""

""I am. I definitely am. But I'm your blessing as well."" He sunk back into his chair. His gaze had grown bleak again. ""God, my life sucks..."" he slurred.

I suddenly remembered the key in my pocket. I quickly glanced over at the file cabinet leaning against Dale's office wall. While I feel guilty about what I did next, I cannot honestly claim that I regret it. I figured if I could get him to drink some more, just a *little* more, I might get the one singular chance to try and get into it. 

Fortune seemed to be on my side this time. My manager turned to me again and asked, ""You want some?"" He pointed at his whiskey. ""I heard they call it firewater. Don't know why, but I think it's because it feels like your mouth's on fire when you drink it.""

I shrugged. ""Sure.""

Dale bent down and rummaged about in his desk drawers for a few seconds before producing an old-looking, slightly dirty glass which he placed next to his own. He filled up both and handed me the new one. 

""To..."" he began, raising his glass, but apparently realizing that he wasn't sure what to drink to.

""Hell?"" I offered.

Dale smirked. ""Damn right. To hell with it. I feel like I'm already there anyways."" With that, he downed his whiskey in one go before immediately refilling his glass. Not wanting to raise suspicion, I did the same.

Now, there's one thing you should know about me. I'm not much of a drinker. I like beer, but that's already it. And I really don't hold my liquor well at all. Already after my first glass of whiskey, I felt my stomach grow uncomfortably warm. After my second glass, I began to feel a bit too amused. My sudden giggles seemed to have a contagious effect on my manager as he began to laugh himself. 

""You know how much I've lost?"" he asked in-between chuckles and I shook my head. ""I lost a whole lot. Wanna know something really sad?"" I nodded. ""A person I love... or at least someone I used to love... he's dying. He's dying and I'm the one who's killing him. I don't want to, you know. But I got to. They *make* me do it."" He let out a wheezing laugh, quickly followed by a train of hysterical sobs.

He refilled our glasses for the third time. ""Who's them?"" I inquired, noticing with concern that I was slurring myself. ""Your family?"" 

Dale looked at me in confusion. ""How'd you...? Whatever. Yes. But it ain't just them. I won't tell you... I won't..."" his voice slowly trailed off. He filled up glasses number four with shaky hands.
He swallowed the contents of his glass after I had done the same before looking up at me one last time. Then, his head sank down onto his desk. 

I had trouble getting up from my chair. I felt really sick all of a sudden. Still, I managed to make my way over to the file cabinet. I had to make use of my chance while Dale was out. It took me a while to insert the key into the lock of the cabinet, but to my suprise and delight, it fit perfectly. Upon turning it and sliding open the drawer, my tired eyes were confronted with folders over folders, neatly lined up behind one another in what little space they had. 

I remember spotting one titled ""Expenses 2020"", another one titled ""Earnings 2020"" and so on. I decided to try if the other drawer would yield more interesting results, so I bent down and unlocked it. To my surprise, it was completely empty, except for two things: an ancient looking wood handle revolver and a black and white photograph. 

I took the latter out of the drawer to inspect it, straining my eyes as I struggled to focus. The picture showed two people in very old-fashioned clothing, a man and a younger woman, or maybe still a girl. They were standing next to each other in front of a grey background I found hard to determine. I thought I could make out some trees, but I could have been wrong. 

What instantly struck me as truly odd however was that the faces of the man and the girl could not be seen. They were blank. There were no eyes, no mouths, no noses... just a blank space were all of that should be. 

Suddenly, I felt my stomach starting to turn. I knew I was going to be sick. I dropped the photograph back into the drawer and hurried to lock both it and the upper drawer up again. I quickly tucked away the key in my pocket before dashing out the door of Dale's office. I had barely made it over to the trashcan next to the bench on the Hollywood plaza when I couldn't confine the contents of my stomach any longer. 

I threw up into the trashcan once, maybe twice before I sank down onto the bench beside me. My surroundings grew darker and darker as my eyes slowly fluttered shut. I barely noticed the low clacking of boots on the pavement approaching. When I felt someone placing their arms under my own and lifting me up, I didn't resist. When they heaved me over their shoulder like a wet sack of sand, I felt the leather of their vest brush uncomfortably against my skin.

They carried me away from the bench. I opened my eyes a few times on our way to see the gray street move underneath me. It was dizzying. The color of the pavement soon grew darker, then light and sandy. Finally, I don't know for how long the person had been carrying me, they came to a halt and carefully lifted me off their shoulders. 

I blinked a few times, groaning as I struggled to stay awake. I was so incredibly tired. I found myself sitting on a wooden porch. It looked familiar and I soon recognized it to belong to the saloon in Twin Vale Point where my co-workers and I had met up two days ago. The man kneeling in front of me, holding my limp body up by the shoulders was familiar too, although it took me a while to place his features. 

He looked genuinely concerned. I remember thinking it was a first, seeing as I usually only knew him with a wide grin on his face. I think I said something, but I can't remember what. It was probably just inaudible stammering anyways. 

The cowboy smiled sympathetically, also something I had never seen him do before. He then raised his hand to brush a strand of hair out of my sweaty forehead. His cold, dry-skinned fingers traced down the side of my face and rested on my cheek for a little while. I am unsure of why I remember this particular action so well, but I do. I stared at him with hooded eyes, trying not to drift off to sleep. It felt like he was trying to comfort me. 

Suddenly, the silence was broken by the loud voice of a man. I recognized it to be that of Mitchell. ""HEY! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?"" 

The cowboy jumped to his feet and I immediately flopped down onto the rough wood below me. I could hear Mitchell run towards us and felt myself being pulled to my feet. 

""Leah? Holy shit... are you alright?"" I heard my colleague ask me. I tried to respond, but no words left my mouth. 

Mitchell proceeded to walk me over to his car, and after about five minutes of me trying to tell him my address, he finally understood where I lived and drove me home.

After a refreshing nap in Mitchell's car's backseat and later on my own couch, I had finally recovered from the whiskey's influence. All that is left of it now is a nasty, nagging headache. 

I told Mitchell about my conversation with Dale and what I had found in the file cabinet, and while we couldn't quite make anything of it, we agreed that things were apparently just continuing to get stranger and stranger. I also told him about the laurel twig, to which he remarked that since the Diva had reacted to it in such a weird way, it must be of importance somehow. 

""Still, we can't just go around performing any weird rituals or whatever,"" he warned me in a low voice to go easy on my headache. ""Who knows why she destroyed the twig after all. We need to figure this out first, then we decide what to do about it.""

""Dale was certain we wouldn't find out anything though,"" I muttered, massaging my temples. ""At least he said as much.""

Mitchell grunted. ""What does he know? He was rolling drunk, obviously he didn't make any sense. Also, did he really say he was into guys?""

I shot him an angry glare. ""That's what you care about, of all the things I just told you?""

""What? I'm just curious,"" Mitchell retorted.

I sighed. ""He said something about how a man he loves is dying and that he's the one who's killing him because he's being forced to.""

Mitchell leaned back against the cushion of my couch, staring at the ceiling in thought. He stayed a bit longer to keep me company. Later that night when my colleague had left, I got a call from Dale himself. He sounded terrible, embarassed and tired at the same time.

""Um, hi... I wanted to apologize. I just woke up, like, half an hour ago and while most of our exchange escapes me, it was probably really unprofessional. If I did anything, well, gross, I want you to know I'm sorry.""

""No worries,"" I told him. ""We just had some whiskey together and you whined about your life, but that's all.""

""Oh."" He paused. ""I was meaning to tell you to stop asking me stuff. Did I do that?""

""Yeah, you did, actually. I won't stop though.""

""Figured as much. Well, you're not gonna get too far anyways, so I'm not too worried. Do as you please, just stay out of my hair."" And there he was, Dale's good old douchy normal self. 

After advising him politely to see a therapist, I hung up. I was relieved he apparently hadn't noticed that I'd messed with his file cabinet. I spent the rest of the night watching TV, but in the back of my head, I kept thinking about what my manager had told me in his drunken stupor. 

Then, exactly twelve minutes after midnight, I had an idea. It's completely absurd, but if it's true, it might be the most brilliant thought I've ever had.

All I know for now though is that I *need* to talk to Nathan again. More than ever.

fsbo0o,samhaysom,My grandma used to tell me scary stories when I was little. The one she told me on my 5th birthday still makes me feel sick.,4060,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsbo0o,193,"Why would you tell a five-year-old kid such a fucked up tale?

Ever since the memory of my fifth birthday came back to me, this is the question I've kept asking myself. But I don't have the answer.

I suppose I shouldn't be that surprised. Given the other stories my grandma told me when I was little – the one about [Mr Long Fingers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ez979d/my_grandma_used_to_tell_me_scary_stories_when_i/), for instance, and the secret of [the special knock](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fdw8v8/my_grandma_used_to_tell_me_scary_stories_when_i/) – I really shouldn't be surprised at all.

What follows is a memory from the day I turned five. I must have been repressing that day for years, because it's taken weeks of therapy for me to unlock it...

\*

""Grandma, will you tell me a story before bed?""

She was halfway to the bedroom door when my words stopped her. I didn't want her to go. Grandma had just tucked me in and turned off my bedside lamp, and I suddenly felt afraid.

Partly it was the darkness of my bedroom – the shadows were so thick I could barely make out my stuffed toys, sitting in a row on top of my dresser – but mainly it was my new birthday present. The present grandma had got me. It wasn't my *main* present – that was the pack of Monsters in My Pocket toys I'd ripped open downstairs. No. This was an extra present. A *secret* present.

I hated it.

Even in the dark, I could see its shadowy outline on my bedside table. The thing gave me the creeps.

""A story? Well, what kind of story would you like to hear?""

It was a silly question, because grandma only ever told me one kind of story. The *scary* kind. But because I was already a bit freaked out, I said something I wouldn't normally have done.

""Nothing *too* scary, grandma.""

Grandma raised her eyebrows at me. ""Not *too* scary?""

I shook my head. She leaned over and switched my bedside light back on, then perched at the foot of my bed. Smiled down at me. Out of the corner of my eye I could still see grandma's present. It was watching me from my bedside table. I did my best to ignore it.

""Okay,"" said grandma, making herself comfortable. ""I think I'll tell you a story about a witch.""

\*

*Once upon a time*, grandma began, *there was a young woman who lived in a cottage by the sea. She didn't have a care in the world. She went to school, and she painted, and she read adventure books by the fire in the evening. This girl lived with her mother and her grandmother, and they were all very close. She loved her family very much.*

*One day in the early summer, the girl was coming home from school when she met a boy on the path. She'd never spoken to him before, but she recognised him well enough – he wore the same uniform she did, after all, and she guessed he must be in the year above her at school.*

*""Where are you off to?"" said the boy. His shirt was untucked, and he was smoking a cigarette.*

*The girl hesitated. Her mother had told her cigarettes were bad. She'd also told her never to speak to strangers on her way home from school. But then again, thought the girl, was this boy actually a stranger? The headmaster at their school said they were all one big family. If this boy wore the same uniform as her, they couldn't* really *be strangers, could they?*

*""I'm going home,"" answered the girl. ""My house is along this path.""*

*The boy finished his cigarette, then flicked it into the grass. He smiled at the girl. ""Before you go home, don't you want to see something cool?"" he asked.*

*The girl was curious, but she also knew she couldn't be late. Her mother would worry terribly if she was late. So she thanked the boy, and told him she had to be on her way.*

*But just as she'd walked past him, he called out to her again. ""It's a puppy!"" said the boy. ""Our dog had a litter of puppies last week, and dad said I could keep one. It's in this old barn near my house. Don't you want to see the puppy?""*

*Now, the girl loved puppies. She'd wanted a dog for as long as she could remember, but her mother always said they couldn't afford one. Right then she'd have given anything in the world to pet a cute little puppy. When she closed her eyes, she could just picture it: a happy little dog with a big, pink tongue and a wagging tail. Eager to meet her. The girl paused, and looked down the path that led back to her house. She thought about her mother. Then she looked back at the boy, who was smiling at her.*

*Was there really any harm, thought the girl, in taking a quick look?*

*So the girl followed the boy, and he led her over a stile and across a big, big field, and they kept going and going until the girl saw a large barn towering in the distance. And she was so excited that she walked as fast as she could, and the boy laughed and walked right along with her.*

*The girl only started to feel nervous when they were right outside the barn.*

*It had taken longer to get there than she'd thought it would, and the sun was a lot lower in the sky now. She was going to be late getting home. Her mother would be worried. She wanted to see the puppy quickly so she could hurry back, but the barn was dark and full of shadows and she couldn't see any sign of it inside.*

*""It's just over here at the back,"" whispered the boy, as he took her hand and led her into the shadows. ""He's going to be so excited to see you.""*

*So the girl took his hand and followed him, and even though his palm was sweaty she held onto it tight, because she was suddenly starting to feel afraid.*

*It was only when she heard footsteps and laughter behind her, and turned to see two bigger boys emerging from the barn's shadows, that the fear inside her turned to terror.*

*\**

*When the girl finally got back home, the sun was setting over the ocean and the sea was the colour of blood.*

*The girl made it through the door of the little cottage before she collapsed in a heap in the hallway, crying her eyes out.*

*It was her grandmother who found her like that.*

*Now, the girl's grandmother was very old, and very wise. Mother used to tell her that grandma had lived so long, and seen so much, that she knew all the world's secrets. When she was little, the girl had been frightened of her grandmother.*

*But now the old lady took the young woman in her arms, and she comforted her. Told the girl her mother was working late, and she wouldn't be home for a while. Told the girl she could tell her anything she wanted.*

*And in the hallway of their little cottage, the girl did.*

*She told her grandmother about the boy, and the barn, and all the horrible things those bigger boys had done to her in the shadows.*

*And her grandmother listened, and she grew very silent, and very still.*

*""Come with me,"" she said.*

*\**

*The girl had hardly ever been in her grandmother's room before. When she was little, it always gave her the creeps. Her grandmother had lots of old, scary paintings on the walls, and strange little statues and carvings on her shelves.*

*But right then, as her grandmother led her to an old wooden chair and sat her down, the girl hardly even noticed them. Her grandmother was speaking to her in a soothing voice, and all she could do was listen.*

*She listened as her grandmother told her that there was a special trick she knew. A trick to protect against evil. A trick to protect her against those horrible boys, so that they'd never be able to hurt her again. So that* she'd *have control of* them\*.\*

*As grandmother spoke, she fetched an old wooden box from the bottom of her wardrobe and unlocked it. Inside the box were countless knitted dolls. All of the dolls were the same blank, creme colour, with no facial features at all save for the eyes. Every single doll had a pair of eyes that seemed to follow the girl.*

*As grandmother pulled three dolls out of the box, she closed her own eyes. Began to whisper. The sound made the girl's skin itch, but it didn't last long. Soon her grandmother had lined the dolls up on the carpet, and her eyes were open again. The last thing she pulled from the box were a pair of black knitting needles and some yarn.*

*""Those boys that hurt you, sweetheart,"" she whispered. ""I want you to describe them to me.""*

*And although she was still terrified and although it made her feel sick, the girl did. She described the boys as well as she could remember. She described them as her grandmother went to work with her needles.*

*And finally, with the blood red sun disappearing below the sea outside the cottage window, the dolls were finished.*

*The girl's grandmother took the girl by the hands, and looked into her eyes.* 

*""I want you to keep hold of these dolls, sweetheart,"" she whispered. ""As long as you have possession of them, those boys will never be able to hurt you again.""*

*And do you know what? Those boys never did.*

*\**

*The girl was sitting in an armchair overlooking the sea when her grandmother burst through the door of the cottage.*

*It was two days after they'd made the dolls, and for the first time since she'd met the boy on the pathway, the girl was feeling calm again.*

*She was feeling calm, but her grandmother clearly wasn't.*

*As the girl turned from the window and smiled in greeting, the old woman held a newspaper out to the girl with shaking hands. THREE BROTHERS TORTURED AND KILLED IN BRUTAL MASS SLAYING, read the headline.*

*""Agatha,"" whispered her grandmother. ""Oh, Agatha! What did you do?""*

*But the girl just kept smiling. She kept smiling as she took her grandmother by the hand, and led her upstairs to her bedroom.*

*She kept smiling as she opened her little cupboard, and pulled out a cardboard box.*

*And when the old lady cried out in shock and horror as she saw the three dolls inside, the girl kept smiling still.*

*""What did you* do\*, Agatha?"" whispered her grandmother again.\*

*But it was pretty obvious what the girl had done.*

*Each of the dolls had been impaled with at least a dozen sewing pins, all of which had been pushed through their knitted heads. The area below each of their waists had been burned black with a flame.*

*The girl smiled down at her work, and took her grandmother's shaking hands in her own.*

*""They won't be hurting* anyone *now, will they?"" she whispered.*

\*

""You see, sweetheart?"" said grandma, as she stood up from my bed and switched off the light. ""I gave you one with a happy ending.""

I lay in the dark, feeling sick. I don't think I'd understood everything grandma had told me – not right then, at least – but I'd understood enough. I'd understood enough to know I felt worse now than I had before the story started.

""Grandma, wait!"" I said, my voice stopping her mid-turn. ""Isn't *your* name Agatha?""

Grandma looked back at me and smiled. She walked over and leaned down, kissing me on my forehead.

""Time to get some sleep, Christopher,"" she whispered. ""And remember – that present I got for you is always there, if you ever need it.""

She stood up and left my bedroom. I stared after her.

But a few moments later, my eyes were pulled back to the gift on my bedside table. 

The knitted doll.

It gazed right back at me, its face featureless save for [two blank, staring eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/samhaysom/).",1585656003.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsbo0o/my_grandma_used_to_tell_me_scary_stories_when_i/
fshx3c,rotsoil,There's an empty ice cream truck at the end of the street but it won't leave until someone buys something,74,nosleep,https://redd.it/fshx3c,4,"I never trusted ice cream trucks. Never liked ‘em either, mostly because an ice cream truck playing music meant there was a hoard of screeching kids close by. I used to loathe when the ice cream truck went by, the tinny sound of Greensleeves filling the air, the sounds of kids giggling and running down the street after it. Then the song would be stuck in my head for hours after that.

I loved when it finally got too cold for the ice cream man to come around. I never understood the appeal of it - buying overpriced ice cream from a stranger in a truck. Maybe parents just went along with it to shut their kids up, I don’t know. 

So you can imagine how I felt when I noticed an ice cream truck sitting at the end of my street. I was immediately filled with annoyance and confusion. I thought it was still too cold for ice cream. Didn’t they start coming around closer to summer? 

I ground my teeth and braced myself, waiting for the music to start playing. It was like nails on a chalkboard for me. 

But it never came.

I went to the front window and peeked through the blinds. It was just sitting there, parked. As far as I could tell, the truck wasn’t running. I felt like one of those stereotypical old people, peeping out the window, glaring at the kids playing outside. But none of the kids were playing outside, I wasn’t old, and there was no one to glare at.

It was a weird truck. The side read “[Mr. Scoopy’s Ice Cream](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsht8z/theres_something_wrong_with_mr_scoopys_ice_cream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)” in big red letters. I’d never heard of Mr. Scoopy’s before, but maybe it was a new company. There was a disturbing mascot under the letters too. It looked like a larger ice cream cone, eating a smaller, terrified one. Was this supposed to entice kids to spend their money here? I thought it was creepy. 

I watched as the kid who lived across the street, Noah, came out of the garage and sheepishly walked down the street towards the truck. I could see his dad laying on his back under a car. Isaac had recently started restoring classic cars. He was in the process of fixing up a red Camaro this time. Probably gave the kid some money so he’d get some peace. I’d seen him and his wife fighting through their windows. Heard them arguing in the garage too, late at night. Pretty sure the whole neighborhood had heard them. 

I didn’t care what their problems were or what they did in their free time. I was a no-nonsense, no drama kind of guy. This was a quiet neighborhood when I moved here. Now everyone was having kids and those kids were screaming and playing all the time and giving me headaches. And now the damn ice cream man was early for the season.

I frowned as I watched Noah come back up the street, head hung slightly. He retreated back in the garage. Not caring what the problem was, I humphed and went back to the couch to watch TV. I heard what the problem had been later that night though.

I’d opened my windows to let the crisp breeze in as I got ready for bed. I liked having fresh air, and I liked the room cold when I slept, but the open windows clued me in on Isaac and his wife having a screaming match in their garage. 

She was yelling about him being a bad parent, a nearly absent father, and asked why he thought it was a great idea to let Noah have ice cream right before dinner. His reply was that it didn’t matter, the truck had been empty anyway. Quite the comeback.

But the truck was still in the same spot in the morning. It caught my eye when I went out for my morning paper. *Maybe someone down the street got a job as an ice cream man,* I thought and went about my day.

A few hours later, I had just gotten settled on my couch and was ready to play the new Doom game when my dog, Bailey interrupted. I’d rescued her when I first moved here, thought it might be nice to have someone to share the house with. But here she was, interrupting my Saturday afternoon plans. She sat right in front of the TV with her leash in her mouth. She looked at me with those big puppy dog eyes that I just can’t say no to. 

And that’s how I found myself walking down the street towards the ice cream truck when that damn music started wailing. I stopped, immediately irritated and turned back towards the house when the leash in my hand pulled back.

Bailey was standing there, refusing to budge. She barked and looked at me expectantly. 

“Alright, fine,” I muttered. My voice was immediately drowned out by the music. I swear Bailey had an extra pep in her step as we continued our walk. I happened to glance through one of the windows of the truck as we walked by. The window in the back was open, but no one was in there as far as I could tell. No one was in the driver’s seat either. 

We did one lap around the block and when I found myself back at my front door, I realized the truck was still playing music but hadn’t moved from its spot at the curb. I was convinced the music was louder than it had been before. 

Swearing internally, I put Bailey inside and marched down to the house the truck was parked in front of. I banged on their door, the ice cream tune piercing my ears. A middle-aged couple opened the door and immediately clasped their hands over their ears. I started shouting to be heard over the noise, but it was pointless. 

They opened their door wider and I stepped inside. As soon as the door shut, the music was muffled, but it could still clearly be heard. If I lived in this house, I would be livid, and my anger gave way to sympathy.

“Can’t you do anything about that truck?” I pleaded. They both looked at me sympathetically. 

“We tried,” the husband said. “We thought it belonged to someone else here, but when it was still here this morning we checked with all the neighbors. It doesn’t belong to anyone here, and no one knows where it came from. We called to have it towed and we called the police, but because it isn’t an emergency, it’s not a priority. We called hours ago and they still haven’t sent someone.”

“So this isn’t your truck?” I asked. They both shook their heads.

“We haven’t seen anyone inside it, or we would have asked them to move it.” 

I thanked them and apologized for bothering them. As soon as they opened their door, we were all assaulted with the tinny music. I made my way back to my house, looking like an idiot with my hands over my ears. 

Once I was safely inside, I started unclipping the leash from Bailey, who had waited patiently for me to come home. I was interrupted by a knock at my door, and Bailly immediately started barking. I opened it to find Isaac and let him in so we could talk better.

“Did you find out what the deal is with that truck?” he asked, looking uncomfortable.

“No, why? Do you know anything?” 

“Something ain’t right about that truck. Noah went to get ice cream yesterday but he said no one was there. When I saw it was still there last night before bed, I went to look at it, but still, no one was there. I already asked Randy, he said it’s not his and he doesn’t know who parked it in front of his house.”

“They called the police to have it removed, so there’s not much we can do but sit and wait,” I said, hoping Isaac would get the hint and leave. I didn’t want any part of whatever nonsense this was. I just wanted to spend my Saturday with my dog, playing video games.

“Anne’s kid is missing,” Isaac whispered, even though we were the only ones here. There was a serious look in his eyes.

“What?” I asked. I’d never heard of a kid going missing here. 

“She said her daughter went to get some ice cream. Must have been sometime this morning, but she never came back. They were combing the neighborhood when the music started playing.”

Something wasn’t adding up here, but I didn’t know what it was. 

“The truck is moving…” I said as something caught my eye outside the window. Big letters spelling out ""Mr. Scoopy’s Ice Cream"" slowly passed by. We both ran to see it. 

The music was now playing at a much more acceptable volume, but the truck was stopped in the very middle of the road. The window was open and I could see someone inside it now. 

“Anyone want anything?” a funny-looking man asked, leaning out the window. He was missing teeth, balding, and his ears were way too big. He looked small and frail like he’d never seen the inside of a gym once in his life. 

Isaac’s wife stood in their garage, watching the truck, a protective arm holding Noah in place. Other parents were starting to come out of their houses as well, but no children ran forward.

“No? Nothing?” he chuckled, eyeing Noah. “No ice cream for you, little boy?” Isaac’s wife tightened her hold on Noah, but Noah’s eyes were wide with fear. 

The weird little man in the truck just shut the window and cut off the music. And the truck just sat there, parked in the middle of the street, until the music sounded again the next day. There was no sign or word from the cops.

When the music started playing, I was on my way back home after another walk with Bailey. As soon as the window opened and the little man stuck his head out to address all of us, Bailey started growling at him. Bailey never growled. She would bark when people came to the door, but otherwise, she was usually very quiet and sweet. 

“Shut that dog up!” the man shouted, glaring at us. 

“Shhh,” I hushed her and put a hand on her back to quiet her. I could feel every muscle in her body was tight and tense.

“Now then, what will it be today?” the man asked as everyone else on the street exited their houses. No one said a word, but I could tell everyone was uneasy.

“Hmm? Nothing again?” the man called out again. “Well, that’s alright, but I won’t be leaving until someone buys something.” As the man leaned back into his ice cream truck and started to shut the window, a voice called out to him.

“Where’s Wyatt? Where is my son?” a tired-looking woman carefully stepped closer to the truck. 

“Hmm? What’s that?” the ice cream man asked, leaning back out.

“M-my son. He asked if he could get some ice cream but he never came back. You would have been the last person he saw. Where is he?” the woman called back, her voice shaking.

“My daughter’s been missing since yesterday!” another woman called, presumably Anne. A couple of other cries joined theirs. 

“I’m not here to talk about missing kids, I’m here to sell ice cream!” the man laughed. Something about his laugh sent goosebumps crawling all over my skin.

“A-alright! I’ll buy some!” a voice called out. Was that my voice? I felt myself moving robotically towards the truck. Bailey whined beside me.

“Oh? What’s that?” The creepy little man leered at me from inside his truck. As I approached, I could see he was wearing an apron, which wasn’t that uncommon. What was uncommon though, was that the apron was one of the heavy rubber ones, not fabric, and the awful stench radiating from his truck, as well as the dark red pattern on his apron. I felt my blood turn to ice.

“I-I’ll buy something,” I gulped. “If I buy something, you’ll leave, right?” It was like I wasn’t in control anymore, and my body was just doing what it wanted. I never got in the middle of anything. I kept to myself and that was how I liked it. So why did I feel the need to be a hero now?

“What will it be?” the man asked, an eager look in his eyes.

“A vanilla cup please.” The ice giant ice cream cone painted on the side of the truck somehow looked even more menacing. I reached into my pocket for my wallet and Bailey whined again next to me. She had a pleading look in her eye and pulled the leash back toward the house. 

“Here you are, sir. One vanilla cup with a cherry on top.” I looked up to see he was holding a cup out to me. I took it with a shaking hand. It was filled with vanilla ice cream but there was something red and pulpy on top. As soon as I realized what it was, I dropped the cup and vomited all over the street and my shoes. Bailey finally tugged free and bolted back to the front yard to wait for me. 

The man slid the window shut, cackling. In seconds, the truck was rolling down the street, playing that wretched music. My vision spun, focused on the spilled cup of ice cream in the street. A small, bloody eye lay in the middle of the mess staring back at me. 

The police showed up shortly after that. They took information about the missing children, and everyone on the street had similar reports about the ice cream truck and the man driving it, but no one remembered seeing a license plate. The police said they'd never heard of an ice cream company called Mr. Scoopy’s Ice Cream. 

Now when I hear the twinkling sound of Greensleeves being played as an ice cream truck drives by, it brings about entirely different feelings; feelings of [terror and dread.](https://reddit.com/r/rotsoil)",1585678129.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fshx3c/theres_an_empty_ice_cream_truck_at_the_end_of_the/

    “Every kid has to try it; go into their search bar and put in the url, ‘youtube.com/sixsixseven.’ Likely, nothing will pop up, just an error this website can not be reached page. Sometimes, fake versions of the account will appear; none of which are the real thing. Many believe the channel exists while others think it’s just a modern age urban legend created to scare the youth of today.  However, regardless of their opinions, everyone knows the story of youtube.com/sixsixseven.” 

Lizbeth leaned back to observe the frighted faces of her peers only to be met with an unimpressed response from a short haired girl sitting directly across from her, “never heard of it.”  Lizbeth remained unresponsive for a moment before splerting out, “seriously Marge!? Everyone’s heard of it! Back me up here, Evlyn.” A pale girl with shoulder length, perfectly curled ginger hair glanced up from the book (which fascinated her more than Lizebeth’s story) and shook her head, “sorry, Liz, neither have I. Where did you even-” Before she was able to finish, she was cut off by Lizbeth, who was overcome with disappointment, “I don’t get how y’all never heard of it. Folks talked about it a whole lot back in my old town.” Even though she had moved to Upstate New York three years prior, her southern drawl and tendencies occasionally emerged. Marge sighed, “why don’t you tell us what the deal is with that channel?” Lizbeth’s face lit up looking at her two friends, “Really?” The girls nodded and Lizbeth continued her story. 

“So people believe that  Youtube sixsixseven was created by a man named Marth Anderson. The original channel name was “Marth’s Forest Adventures.” He created the channel to document his explorations into the woods behind his house. As time went on, viewers could hear distant screaming and cries for help in the background of his videos. Marth wrote it off as coyotes or some other animal. Soon after, a little girl would begin appearing in some of his videos. She would be seen walking next to him, only her head and shoulders would be visible. Marth always kept the rest of her body off frame. Whenever the girl was in his video, screams wouldn’t be present. Over the next few months, the girl began to appear less and less, the few she was in he appeared tired and out of it. The comments section on Marth’s channel began to become flooded with concerned viewers asking if the young girl was ok. Still, Marth would never address the girl or the comments that he had been receiving in any of his videos. 

One day, Marth slipped up and for just a few frames, the girl’s body was in frame. If a viewer paused the video at the right time, they would see a horrific sight. Her body was unnaturally skinny, with almost no muscle on her bones. She was covered in severe burns and many deep scars, some of which appeared to still be bleeding. Her bones were visibly broken and dislocated. Some people pointed out a large bruise encircling her ankle, implying that she was recently shackled to something. After this video was uploaded, it supposedly went viral, with people talking about it on several other websites like Reddit and 4Chan. People flooded the video, leaving concerned and angry comments, claiming that they had reported his channel and video to both the authorities and YouTube itself. 

Due to the overwhelming amount of comments and reports, YouTube took down his channel, but not before Marth changed his channel name and uploaded his final video.     The video was exactly six minutes long and was shot in a dark dingy looking room. The camera quality was significantly worse than his previous videos. In the background you could just barely make out a figure collapsed on the ground, slowly making its way to the camera. As the figure gets closer, it becomes apparent that it is the little girl. She attempts to stand up once she reaches the camera but ultimately collapses again. This time she doesn’t get back up. For the remainder of the video, all that could be seen was the girl’s lifeless corpse. Even though no one could access his channel, people continued to speculate what happened to Marth and the mysterious girl. Eventually, people lost interest and Marth’s channel was forgotten…

That is, until a few years ago, a teenage girl named Serra Winchester came across the story and decided to look up the channel. Like she expected, an error page came up. She quickly moved on and forgot about the channel. Later that night, however, while she was scrolling through her recommended videos, a video uploaded by a channel with one subscriber popped up. The thumbnail was a black screen and the title below it read as, “Here’s Your Answer.” Curious about why it was recommended, she clicked on the video. Before the video had time to load, Serra clicked the channel link to find its name, and to her horror it read, “sixsixseven.” The channel had only one subscriber. She went back to the video and watched as a figure slowly made its way across a dark room. Captivated by the eerie video, she was unable to look away. As the figure reached for the camera, a bloodcurdling scream could be heard by Serra’s neighbors. When they went to investigate, they found nothing but an empty chair and a channel with two subscribers.” 

Lizbeth leaned back, this time she was met with the response she had hoped for, Evylin spoke up, “holy- ok that was actually pretty creepy.” Marge nodded and added, “yeah it was kinda creepy I guess. But it’s definitely not believable.” Lizbeth smirked, “but that’s where you’re wrong. That Serra girl did actually exist and she actually went missing. Even the channel part was in her missing persons case file.” Marge shook her head, “even if the girl exists, that doesn’t mean the channel exists or that it has some sort of magical power or whatever to kill people. I bet if we looked up the channel, 1: nothing would come up and 2: we wouldn’t die.” Lizbeth remained silent, looking at Marge in disbelief. Evlyn eventually spoke up, “I agree with Marge… I think. So why don’t we try it?” Lizbeth reluctantly agreed, “fine… we’ll look it up on our phones after school.” 


*    *    *

Later that day, before heading home, the girls each took out their phones and began to type into the Youtube search bar. Lizbeth quickly exited the app and quickly said, “I’m sorry I can’t do this. Please don’t do this. I know it’s likely fake. But what if..?” Marge ignored her friend’s pleas and searched the term. As she expected, she was met with an error page. She showed the screen to Evlyn and Lizbeth, “see, nothing happened. Now let's go, chickens. I have to be at the field for practice in ten minutes.” With that, the girls went their separate ways. 

That night, after finishing homework, Marge logged into YouTube to watch a Pewdiepie video. When she found the video she wanted to watch, she clicked on it. But, when the video loaded, it didn't play Pewdiepie. On the screen was a dark room with a figure making its way closer to the camera. 


*    *    *

The next morning at school, Evlyn approached Lizbeth with concern on her face, “have you seen Marge?” As she spoke, she showed Lizbeth the channel which now had three subscribers. ",1585707169.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsqle4/youtubecomsixsixseven/
fsik1u,Dark-n-creepy,Testimony of a hidden Cannibal,28,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsik1u,3,"I love food. Every type of food and I’m not joking when I say this. If something can be digested and not kill me. I love it. Some would call me a monster, others would call me insane, but they all would call me a cannibal. I am what I am. I ate wild animals when I was a kid such as rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks, prairie dogs, even a cat and a dog that wandered too far from their owner’s home. I loved the assorted textures between the different kinds of meat. It was an extraordinary experience.


I'm very fond of my childhood even if I did not have that many friends and spent many nights alone with just my thoughts and I. Those nights alone are when I figured out that all you need to survive in life is food and water. Those are the essentials and nothing else. I never planned to ever have a job but I was going to live in the wild where I can kill and hunt animals on my own. But I figured out a way to get free meat for the rest of my life that I could not find in the wild. The best kind of meat.


Since then I can’t stop myself from doing it. It’s as natural to me as a baby is to crying. I’m also not as rare as you might think. There are others like me all across the world, they just don’t admit it or have not been introduced to how delicious the flesh of man is. You may ask how I acquire something so controversial as human flesh. If we live in the same place in the world, you just might find out for yourself but of course, you would not be alive to see it.


I’m not saying that I kill people. That’s far too risky and is not worth going to jail over because then I would never be able to eat flesh again. Let me just say that I chose my career as such that I am around dead bodies enough to know that it's wrong to waste. You don’t feed a pig until it's big and then kill it and bury it into the ground. No, people would call that wasting, but hypocrites are they who say the opposite thing with human beings who have died.


The worst part of my work is watching perfectly good meat being burned into a tiny little pile of ash that is then put inside an Urn. A complete waste of meat not just for me but for all the insects and bacteria that would have thrived off of consuming that body are left to search elsewhere for food. That person lived their whole lives consuming plants and the flesh of animals and when it’s their turn to be eaten they choose to be burned by fire instead. Selfish, completely inconsiderate of the other organisms that live on this earth.
When I cremate people I always treat their body with utter disrespect because that’s all their body is worth now. It’s worth nothing more than the dirt we walk on because that’s what it becomes.


You may be wondering how I get my Supply of human meat. It's a very delicate process but has worked very effectively. Well while I prepare the body to go inside the casket, I make incisions in the side of the legs and take out as much meat as I possibly can without it looking like anyone touched it. Then simply replace it with some sort of filler and sow the person back up. It's a very delicate process but I have mastered it over the years. It's so amazing how unobservant mourning people are. They never notice a difference through their tears.


I don't think what I'm doing is illegal. I'm not hurting anyone and no one knows about it except you but you don't know my identity. So I won't stop, I simply just wanted to inform others who crave human meat like me out there. That there is a way to be a cannibal without killing or hurting anyone.",1585680112.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsik1u/testimony_of_a_hidden_cannibal/
fsbyr5,ByfelsDisciple,"I was curious about how serial killers think, but now I wish I was dead",175,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsbyr5,12,"I had to weep silently so that the little boy would not hear me from inside his closet. The tears absolutely *ruined* my clown makeup, but I was not going to come out until dark, so he probably wouldn’t notice. 

And even if he did, that would just make it creepier.

It was hard to breathe in such a cramped space. I’m very claustrophobic, but there could be no deviation from the instructions.

[Not if I wanted my wife to eat again this week](https://redd.it/frphhm). 

“Daddy, the clown is back in my closet!” the boy complained from across the room.

A man groaned. “Damn it, Timmy, there’s *no* clown in your stupid closet. I’ve checked every night this week, and it’s getting old fast.”

A silence lingered that could only indicate the challenging and electric bond that defined an unspoken gaze between father and son. 

He sighed. “This is the last time I’m checking, Timmy. I swear, you’re six years old, you shouldn’t be afraid of the closet anymore.”

I held my breath and buried my head in his dirty clothes. My hand wrapped around the can of gasoline beneath my knees. Word cannot describe how much I feared to use it, but my instructions were clear. 

If I ever discovered by an adult, the entire house gets burned to the ground. No one escapes. No survivors. 

Not even me.

The door opened. 

“See? Nothing but the dirty laundry that your mother told you *three times* to take downstairs.”

The door closed.

More unspoken silence. 

Then, softer, “Good night champ. Big day at school tomorrow.”

The lights flicked off. 

---------------

*In the dark, the past came back to me. “Do you love me?” Annie had asked, and I told her yes. The morning light was catching her stray, wispy hair in a way that stood somewhere between careless and disheveled. “How do I know you love me?” she teased, and I didn’t know what to say. The reality is that the first time I ever saw her, I was disappointed. My friend had promised to set me up with someone hot, but this tiny, mousy girl was average at best. In time, though, each physical feature had bound itself to an indelible memory: her snub nose kept rubbing against my shoulder after the first time we made love; she could stick three flowers behind her wide, protruding ears; and her cerulean fingernails would slide deliciously through my hair when she reached both arms back while I was on top and her face was buried in the pillow, begging me to go faster, and her fingers would pull on my locks when I was almost there.*

*I couldn’t tell her that I loved her for being the most beautiful person on earth, because I knew she wouldn’t believe the truth.*

--------------

I played counting games. After 19 minutes and 13 seconds, I couldn’t put it off any longer. I stood up and pulled the jar from behind me. 

I could feel it vibrating with energy, even if it was too dark to see inside. I hated myself for doing this, but rules had to be followed. 

So I unscrewed the top and flipped the jar into his dirty clothes.

With a soft *thud,* the mass landed and scattered. In the silence, I could almost hear it: 

A thousand freed cockroaches were now roaming this boy’s closet. It would be weeks before they found every one.

I struggled to put the clown nose on. It was difficult; I had slit the flesh of my nostril open, leaving spare flaps that would always crust over with scabs and boogers. 

The physical pain dulled but never left. I didn’t have any regrets, though.

He’d given my wife *two* pints of oatmeal that week.

I sat softly on the edge of his bed, making sure to pick a spot in the patch of moonlight streaming through the window. Though he was in the dark, I could tell by the glistening reflection of moonlight on his eyes that he was looking at me.

“Are you here to scare me again tonight, Clown?”

I nodded fervently enough to bounce the bed.

“And my parents will never believe me if I tell them about you?”

I shook my head slowly.

The soft crumpling of sheets told me that he was crawling toward the farthest corner of his racecar bed. “Wh-” he hitched a sob. “What are you going to make me do?” he asked in the quietest whisper.

With a trembling hand I reached into my oversized clown pocket and produced a piece of Tupperware. I grabbed my own wrist to steady myself.

“Are you going to hurt my mom and dad if I don’t do everything you say?” he asked in a voice filled with more terror than any child should ever experience.

I nodded, dragging it on long enough to make sure there was no ambiguity. 

Then I peeled the plastic lid back.

My wife’s beautiful finger lay inside, looking grotesquely out of place without her hand attached. Her cerulean nail polish, usually so exotic and mysterious, seemed so cold and dead. 

Pulling the meat from her bone had been one of the hardest things I ever had to do. I was very glad I’d completed that task ahead of time.

I picked a chunk of shredded flesh out of the Tupperware, staining my clean, white clown gloves a rusty red. 

“Eat up,” I growled. 

*

I leaned against the wall for another sleepless night of standing in the closet. The oversized tassels on my ridiculous outfit seemed to mock me as they bobbed up and down with my silent, heaving sobs.

I’d have killed myself long ago if it weren’t for the threats of what he’d do to her.

At least tonight was a success, though.

*He* had been watching the whole time. He makes me keep a tiny camera in my clown hat.

I’d been a good boy, so my wife would get to eat [*three* times this week](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

fsmka1,haaleyburke,There's a hole in the ceiling of my local McDonald's.,27,nosleep,https://redd.it/fsmka1,6,"For about a year now, there's been a tile missing in the ceiling of my local McDonald's bathroom. The bathroom, much like the restaurant itself, is small - it has three stalls, one of which is a handicapped stall, and is usually out of order. The hole is in the ceiling between both of the other two stalls, so you're bound to see it. 

However, due to the placement of the lights, you can't see directly into said hole. You can only see darkness and a hint of a few pipes.

My friends and I hang out in town pretty often, and when we're not exploring the trails in the woods we go to the mall and McDonald's, especially when it's cold. So when I go in there, cold and exhausted, the last thing I want is to feel paranoid about something watching me from the ceiling.

The story I'm about to tell takes place throughout several different days, and technically starts about two months ago, when I was hanging out with my friends one night.

•

It was late. We'd just come from our usual spot in the woods and were sitting in a booth waiting to be picked up. My friends, Sierra and Ben, ended up getting picked up before me, and I'd just received a text from my mom saying she'd be another 20-30 minutes.

Frustrated, tired, and having to pee, I got up and started toward the bathroom. I pushed the oddly heavy door open and stopped in my tracks.

No. There's no way. How would that even be possible? I forced my fear down and went into the stall, blaming it on me just being tired. But I knew. It was only for a split second, but I knew.

I'd seen feet dangling from the hole in the ceiling.

•

A week or so later, I was in practically the same situation. My friends had left already and I was waiting at McDonalds - this time I was hesitant to go in the bathroom, but I desperately had to pee and knew I couldn't hold it until I got home. Reluctantly, I entered the bathroom and decided to go in the first stall.

I kept my eyes on the hole the entire time. And though it was still hard to see, I could swear I saw eyes staring back down at me.

•

After these two occasions, we didn't hang out for a while due to exams, and I nearly forgot all about it. 

The next time, however, was something I'll never forget.

This time, I was waiting for my friends to meet up with me, and I'd already bought food. I had the unfortunate timing of having to pee, so I had to bring my food in with me - gross, but I'd rather that than it getting taken or thrown out. 

I set it down on the floor in front of me (it was still in the bag, obviously) and did my business. As I stood up, however, something caught my eye.

I looked up, and to my horror, saw a hand reaching out of the ceiling.

It stopped at about the forearm and stayed still. I was terrified. I froze, not knowing what to do, and suddenly heard a low growl coming from what I assumed was also the source of the hand.

I looked down at my bag of food. Slowly, I picked it up and reached into it, bringing out a couple of fries. This is ridiculous, I thought as I reached up, offering the fries to the hand.

It snapped out quickly and grabbed them, startling me. After a few seconds it reached out again, so I gave it a few more. I heard growling again and decided, fuck it, I can spend a few dollars on a hungry creature in the ceiling, right? I gave it my entire box of fries.

•

My friends and I still hang out regularly, and we still go to McDonald's. I haven't told them, and I don't plan to, but I still feed my friend in the ceiling every time I go in the bathroom.",1585692716.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsmka1/theres_a_hole_in_the_ceiling_of_my_local_mcdonalds/

Wondering and worrying about what the boy was doing out in the middle of the night alone, Jeff accepted and began following the boy, his friends however refused and left them alone.

  As they approached the edge of the forest some unforeseen entity grabbed the boy by the leg and dragged him into the forest where he disappeared. Jeff quickly began chasing after the boy with no hesitation. After running around for several minutes a nauseating scent reached his nose that cause him to immediately vomit on the forest floor. After regaining his composure Jeff, unconsciously, went towards the source of the smell, however a voice in the back of his head was telling him to run away as fast as he could and get the police.

  The stench was getting more rancid the closer Jeff got to the source, until he reached to source. The sight of the source of the smell made Jeff vomit again, in-front of Jeff on the floor, dead was the boy from earlier, but he was torn to shreds, missing an arm, leg, and part of his face. Jeff assumed the body was there for a while due to the sheer amount of maggots crawling on the body, Jeff then ran out of the forest and called the police. Thirty minutes later the police arrive and Jeff leads them to the body. After they discover the body Jeff is brought in for questioning by the police. After several minutes of questioning they realize that Jeff had nothing to do with the death of the boy. Several years later it is still unknown how or when the boy died.

  Jeff on the other hand, knew exactly what killed the boy, and he will never forget it. He saw the grotesque creature, lurking behind the tree that the boys corpse was in front of. What he also knew is that if he told anyone what he saw the thing would come for him next. Who could he tell anyway? After all who would believe he saw a seven-foot tall monster with blood-red eyes, pitched black skin resembling obsidian, long brown hair, four tentacle like arms that were constantly morphing into different shapes, and bird-like feet with six-inch talons. 

  At this moment Jeff thought ""screw it,"" and called one of his friend, Hank, who was one of the friends who left him that  horrific night and proceeded to tell them everything. Obviously his friend thought he was crazy, that is until he heard what was happening on the other side of the phone. There was a loud crash of shattering glass, and Jeff screaming ""Oh god, it's here!"" For a moment there was silence, then the sound of Jeff screaming in pain, followed by high pitched demonic laughing, then... There was silence once again.

  After snapping out of his initial moment of shock, Hank ran to Jeffs house. Upon entering he ran to the door of Jeffs bedroom, terrified of what he may find on the other side of it Hank hesitated for a few seconds. He then noticed the pool of blood seeping out from underneath the door, snapping him out of hesitation causing him to immediately kick open the door, and see the mangled body of his friend lying in the corner, dead. As Hank collapsed in shock and depression, he noticed something strange. The blood splattered on the wall spelled something. When he examined it more closely his heart sank, and he knew he had to get out of the house. written on the wall in Jeffs blood was ""You're Next, Hank.""",1585703859.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsppww/the_boy_disappeared_into_the_forest/

*!**THIS FILE HAS BEEN LOOKED OVER BY THE GALACTIC COUNCIL. SOME INFORMATION IS CLASSIFIED AS PER INDIVIDUAL SECURITY CLEARANCE**!*

My name is >!Dr. Teerach-Undi!<, I have been tasked with the laying chronology and distinct reasoning behind the disappearance of the Human race. Embedded in this collection of audio logs, is the standard YeveyTech translation plug-ins, originally scripted in the commonly spoken language of the Humans, English; this was done out of sentimental respect for the species.

Case-file: >!Catastrophic Extinction Event (CEE)!<: 1651

Death toll: >!24 Billion!<

Time-frame: >!Instantaneous!<

Despite the relatively large number of CCEs we have experienced within the last 10,000 cycles, we have never fathomed of one being so large and abrupt as this. Reports from the Galactic Councils have given eye witness reports of instantaneous vanishings of large numbers of Humans.  I have taken a vested interest in discovering what has happened and have been assigned, by the council, to do just that.

\>Orbit 1:

Today is my first day on the investigation, where to begin is the hardest part. I have been scanning over some of the eye-witness reports given to me by the council, reading these has been a very emotional process, but my work must start somewhere.

CCE-EW-232:

The following is a testimonial from the head maternity Doctor at >!Veet-Nihara General Hospital!< on the planet of >!Thumerah-6!<, following a routine child-birth as the CCE hits.

*It was a regular day, to be honest, practitioners doing their rounds around the hospital, the ER wasn’t any busier than usual. At around mid-day we had a Human Female going into labour, her husband was accompanying her during the birth, she decided to forgo the option of painkillers, she wanted the birth to be as natural as possible. The procedure was normal, until near the end. The Mother sat back as if all pain had left her or she just ignored it completely, which I have never personally seen, and as soon as the child was born it happened. They simply vanished, no idea what caused it but, as true as I am sitting here telling you this? They were just...gone.*

Note: All I can say is at least they went as a family? Considering the doctor stated that she had no idea how this happened, >!If it was something physical, maybe it cant be directly observed by biological senses?!< Whatever it was if they are safe on the other side of this, I am glad the child was not left behind, imagine what could possibly come of this child if this all happened mid-birth...I shudder to think.

CCE-EW-441: 

Source: >!Eros-1 Planetary Police Division 1!<

Location: >!Geynar City University!<

Subject Questioned: Species: Levenn, Male, 22 Cycles old, Student.

*Reporting officer: “Was there anything unusual about today?”*

*Witness: “Not at all, if anything its been one of the better days of the week, that is until-”*

*Officer: “I understand, today is tragic, any information you can give us, might just allow an insight into this whole thing”*

*Witness: “What can I say? He vanished, blink and you’ll miss it. Professor Fredricks was a real chill dude, he never held anything against us if we fell a bit behind in his class and he always seemed to really enjoy his job you know? I just wished I could be like him once I graduated.”*

*Officer: “Did Professor Fredricks seem…off...at all? Did he look sick? Weak?”*

*Witness: “No, no he didn’t. >!But he did seem...happier?!<”*

*Officer: “>!Happier?<! How so?”*

*Witness: “I don’t really know >!like he was more ‘at peace’ than usual!<, I figured he had just gotten himself laid or something.”*

Note: Just like many people, not just the young, this kid seemed to idolise Humans, the fact they stuck around this long? Still teaching, after all, they have taught us? Who wouldn’t respect that? They gave us everything from space travel to mobile communication, when they got here we barely knew what fire was, we probably thought they were making it out of thin air when they arrived. You would think they would be bored with teaching by now? After all, they have been helping grow countless planets to this level for over 18,000 cycles.

One thing to note however is this young Leveen’s report, he mentions his professor being more “at peace” than usual, this is interesting, something I will further look into.

(Note: There are more than shown here I have read and listened to, sources will be provided for your own interest)

Orbit 7: Alright, a few cycles have passed now and there is a theme that the majority of these reports seem to include, this idea of the Humans not showing any signs of pain or panic, although I do imagine this to be the case if you were suddenly blinked out of existence, what I mean is that it seems like the >!humans may have been somewhat aware of what was happening!<, maybe? Which tells me, if this indeed is the case, they had no intention of trying to fight it, >!almost as if this was a species agreed-upon reaction!<, very odd indeed.

Orbit 22: I have taken it upon myself to read through some of the Human’s old history. For a very long time, they had many different beliefs,>!(Christianity and  Buddhism to name a couple)!< and seemed almost obsessed with some relatively big questions, at least, big to them at the time. >!Why are we here? What will happen when we die? Is there an afterlife?!< After quite a large number of cycles, these questions eventually were replaced more with setting up colonies on planets and moons, expanding the reaches of their species. This all seemed to come after their major issues with pollution and environmental degradation came to an end some time in their mid-to-late 5000 cycles. The religious texts were no longer studied as they used to be and their minds focused on expansion. These were the days we see their plans come to be about teaching any life that would need or want it, their new ways of sustainable living and immense growth.

However, I would like to get back to those ideas of afterlife and destiny that they so wished to learn about. The beliefs they had as a species, they all differed in some way, however, it seemed they all were ideas of how to live and conduct yourself through life. One way Christianity puts it is this, speaking of their deity and the afterlife:

\>! *“He will render to each one according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.”!<*

To me, personally? This is some pretty heavy stuff. My species never had these ideals, I found myself wondering what we have missed out on >!until I learned that quite a few of their major conflicts were derived from disputing visions and belief systems, honestly, so much blood was spilt that I am pretty sure those in charge back then had cemented their place in what was known as “Hell”.!<

There are other forms of this duality of good and bad in their history. >!Some believed that there were many deities and there were many different possible afterlives, Valhalla, Paradise and Enlightenment. Now, enlightenment is an interesting one.!<

It is currently almost morning, I have been reading these for days on end and I need rest, I shall continue in a few days and update accordingly. >!But maybe a trip to Earth might be an option? I shall ask the Council if I feel the need for it.!<

To all those who are listening to this, I have learned that The council has been scrubbing my research, I don’t have much time, but they have obviously changed their tune about me figuring this whole thing out.

After my findings, I felt something wasn’t quite right, The Council refused my request for transport to Earth with nothing, no reasoning as to why it was a bad idea, so I took it upon myself, I found safe passage and gave a lot of my savings to do so, this wasn’t after being stopped by the council at almost every attempt to do so legitimately, I never thought my life would boil down to being a fugitive. Some people believed in my cause, however, well...either that or they resent the council for some other nefarious things they are most likely up to, I can’t believe we trusted these deceitful bastards. How could such a thing happen in a society built by Humans? Maybe they knew too, had to give a heads-up before handing off the responsibility to what turned out to be a bunch of lesser damn species who have no hope in continuing what the Humans had helped build for us.

The Humans were parents, lovers, friends, teachers, scientists, they were the gentle but sturdy fabric of our entire way of life, and they want to brush this shit under the rug like their covering up a crooked cop? Billions of beings on thousands of planets looked up to these people as saviours, half of us would still be breaking rocks on bigger rocks right now, but with their help, we were risen to be more, be one with the cosmos and everything around us like our life was a gift and we didn’t throw it away like spoiled milk.

Sorry, I got caught up in the bullshit, in case you’re wondering, I have managed to befriend a hacker of sorts, hopefully, this is being plastered all over social channels and news outlets across the planets under The Councils umbrella.

The Humans, they were onto something long before they left their planet. if it isn’t scrubbed already, the log should be accessible to all in whatever form our loving overseers have left it in. I dug into this idea of Enlightenment, I’m not saying that The Buddhists were right, but they seemed to be pretty spot on. The Humans, they aren’t dead, well...not truly, not in the form we believe. While on Earth, I came across what they called their Unified Government, almost lour Council, but in the form, it should have been. Everything was there, although it was very hard to get in. All the steps in their plan to expand a teach, the original blueprints for the Kuiper Colonies, the plans for instant renewable energy sources, everything, It was a freaking gold mine!

One day, near the start of their 6000th cycle, they all seemed to have this species-wide epiphany about their place in this world, all weapons that were still around after their disarmament agreements were scrapped, their nations worked together to reach a new ‘plane of existence’, as they put it. They realised that they had a chance to make things right. Years before we knew of them, they were a plague upon their star system and finally realised that they could not allow that corruption to spread through the stars. So they set out to make it right and teach new life not to make their mistakes and hell….they seemed to do a crack-up job of it, until now. Now that the Humans have left us, the true nature will repeat the failings that the Humans fought to never let happen again, I plead of you, whoever you are, whatever your species, do not let them. We must learn one more lesson from those who came before, do not let the fight Humans made be for nothing, look at what they gave us, I feel I can trust the heart and mind of the general population to not let the shit of The Council slide, and we can, one day, follow in the right footsteps.

fs2uus,Deanothedino,LPT: With spring upon us do not immediately kill a snake you find in your yard. Nearly all snakes we come into contact with are non-venomous and most are actually great to have around the house (especially if you have a garden) as they keep pests and rodent populations under control.,4811,LifeProTips,https://redd.it/fs2uus,367,"There are a few things to consider when you see a snake in your yard.

1. If you are unsure of what type of snake it is, it is best to leave it alone and try to identify what kind it is later after you have moved away from it.
2. Keep kids and pets away from the snake until it identified. If it is harmless, it is still a good idea to not let the kids or pets play around that area for a little while.
3. In most areas, you can call your local humane society or make a non-emergency call to your local law officials. Some areas have an actual snake removal professional you could call.
4. Attempt to identify the snake, this website is a great resource to use if you live in North America: [http://www.whatsnakeisthat.com/](http://www.whatsnakeisthat.com/) (this is not a solicitation nor do I have any affiliation with this site, I have used this site for years as I live near a river this has been the best, quick resource I have found). There are also great tips on here for snake bites, discouraging habitat for snakes, etc...
5. Never try to kill or move a venomous snake, this is dangerous. Let a professional handle it. Also, remember the snake means you no harm and is actually more scared of you, then you are of it (believe it or not).

I hope this helps and remember every creature has a purpose!

&#x200B;

Edit 1: To all of our friends down under - your venomous snake encounters are potentially higher (as pointed out in the comments), in my OP I was speaking from a North American perspective, my fault. Regardless stay safe and share the earth :)

Edit 2: To all of Australia, I am sorry and I was thinking only from a North American perspective. Some of what I have listed still applies so that does not totally change how you should think about snakes (like calling a professional and do not handle or try to kill venomous snakes), however, great information in the comments and glad we got this conversation started!

One of our big things is getting rid of clutter. 

Nobody enjoys having clutter around. It just sort of happens if you aren't careful. I read another tip on reddit a few months ago: ""The job isn't done until the tools are put away."" This has led me to realize that a lot of the stuff we have, doesn't have a place to be put away to. 

When stuff doesn't have a place, it ends up on your kitchen table, taking up space in the living room corner, or on the bedroom floor. It becomes clutter. 

So help yourself out, give everything a place. It's place can be in a laundry basket instead of the scattered around your bedroom. It can be in the trashcan if you have no use for it. 

Put it away, sell it, give it away, or throw it away. 

TLDR:

Stuff that doesn't have a place to be put away becomes clutter. Clutter makes you feel bad. Give everything a place, even if it means getting rid of the item. ",1585660149.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fscmb4/lpt_everything_you_own_should_have_a_place_even/

And if you need a really secure seam, staple a double or even a triple row of staples, staggering the staples like bricks in a brick wall, so that there will be a double density of points where the staple wires clinch the fabrics together. Alternatively, you can staple at an angle and lay down a dense trail of staples along your seam.

For high density stapling, the narrow school supply stationary staples work best, since they let you use the densest pattern.

fsqlu5,brokeback_cul_de_sac,LPT: Remove foil around a baked potato before refrigeration,4,LifeProTips,https://redd.it/fsqlu5,5,"Although rare, cooking and storing a baked potato wrapped in foil can lead to botulism.[*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/30114131)[‡](https://www.statefoodsafety.com/Resources/Resources/is-my-baked-potato-safe-to-eat) Botulism, if left untreated, can lead to respiratory and muscular paralysis—and ultimately, death.[†](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism)

&nbsp;  
The neurotoxin that leads to botulism is found in soil. Potatoes come from the soil.[†](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism) The issue is twofold:   

* **Cooking**: A foil-wrapped potato holds in moisture—sometimes preventing the surface temperature to reach high enough temperatures to kill the toxic spores which lead to botulism. Paradoxically, the heat kills off competing bacteria, making it easier for the toxin to grow.[‡](https://www.statefoodsafety.com/Resources/Resources/is-my-baked-potato-safe-to-eat)
* **Storage**: At room temperature, foil-wrapped potatoes provide the oxygen-free environment needed for toxins to form.[*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/30114131) Furthermore, inside a refrigerator, the aluminum foil may also create favorable conditions for the toxin to grow.[‡](https://www.statefoodsafety.com/Resources/Resources/is-my-baked-potato-safe-to-eat)

&nbsp;  
How to handle baked potatoes safely, according to [StateFoodSafety.com](https://www.statefoodsafety.com/Resources/Resources/is-my-baked-potato-safe-to-eat):
>* **DON’T** let your potato sit out in the open at room temperature for over four hours regardless of whether or not it is wrapped in aluminum foil. Although botulinum bacteria cannot grow without the presence of aluminum foil, (or something that prevents the potato from being exposed to air) other bacteria can still grow on the potato if it is left out at room temperature.  
* **DO** serve potatoes immediately after baking them or store them in the refrigerator to keep your potato at a safe temperature. If you use aluminum foil, remove the foil directly after baking to prevent botulinum bacteria from growing.  
* **DON’T** place a baked potato in the refrigerator with the aluminum foil still on it. Your potato will have to pass through the temperature danger zone as it cools down, and if the aluminum foil is still on it, botulinum bacteria may have the potential to grow.  
* **DO** remove the aluminum foil from your potato before storing it in the fridge.[‡](https://www.statefoodsafety.com/Resources/Resources/is-my-baked-potato-safe-to-eat)

Note: Aluminum foil and airtight Tupperware containers are interchangeable for this LPT; both storage methods can create the conditions for the botulinum toxin to thrive.

We need to emerge from the wreckage with clear, achievable goals that will finally give us the world we deserve. There will be no gate-keeping or purity tests; it is for people of all political persuasions, races, genders, and classes. All are welcome.

We need a Universal Basic Movement.

—Universal Basic Income: Every 18+ year old citizen will have the right of receiving $1,000 a month with no bureaucracy, no strings attached.

—Universal Basic Health Care: Every citizen will have the right of high-quality healthcare.

—Universal Basic Education: Every citizen will have the right of a high-quality Preschool–12th grade education.

—Universal Basic Freedom: Every citizen will have the right of freedom of their own body and mind. Prison will be for violent criminals and not non-violent drug offenses. You will have the right to privacy, to delete your internet footprint and own your own data.

The infrastructure currently exists for all of this. It is reasonable and achievable. Politicians are supposed to act in our interest and carry out our collective will. We must demand this with no quarter.

If anyone says we can’t afford it, they are lying.

fsoqje,Kingparti2,TIFU by sharing a secret pregnancy,30,tifu,https://redd.it/fsoqje,6,"This happened 45 minutes ago...still laughing / cringing about it

I have been seeing a girl for about 6 months. Nothing super serious but we are having fun and some of that fun has been a bit irresponsible. As a result - we found out last weekend that she was 6 weeks pregnant. 

Fortunately we are both in exactly the same place re: what we want to do re: pregnancy given the stage of relationship and where we are at in life. However we have both agreed to keep it on the DL and *only* share with each other. (People have very strong views on these sort of things and TBH we didn't want any unnecessary judgement/advice from friends / family)

Anyway - this morning I got my GF with the BEST April Fool (pretending via text I'd lost my job and my visa was expiring so i have to leave the country.) I allowed her the obligatory 10 seconds of panic before saying ""April fools"" and chucking to myself watching the ""F you"" and ""You're a d*ck"" messages roll in.

I was literally still chuckling when my housemate (who had been over to my GF's last night) said COMPLETELY out of the blue, 

Housemate: ""So - [GF Name] told me last night that she is pregnant"". 
Me: ""Errrrrmmm really?""
Housemate: ""Yes - how do you feel about it?""
Me: ""Well...."" - Proceeds to explain in great detail how I feel about this secret pregnancy, the pros and the cons, my deepest feelings, how I'm so glad I can talk about it with someone etc etc

About about a minute of me pouring my heart out - my housemate looks at me and says ""Dude wtf are you on about? We were just joking it's April Fools. Is [GF] actually pregnant??!"" FUCK - At this point no amount of denial could disguise the transparency of my face. And so, beetroot red with embarrassment at being caught so easily, I told housemates all about it, half in hysterics at how swiftly karma was redistributed after my mean April Fools on her.

Tl:dr - Immediate Karma retribution after shitty April Fools by unwittingly informing our friendship group of secret unwanted pregnancy",1585700233.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fsoqje/tifu_by_sharing_a_secret_pregnancy/
fsn8wg,OwnsABear,TIFU by ignoring my naked fiancée in the doorway. Twice,14,tifu,https://redd.it/fsn8wg,7,"TL:DR at the end

This happened 20 minutes ago.

So. Tonight is magic the gathering night and tomorrow is dnd night. Tuesday, Wednesday are not my fiancée's favourite days. Usually I go out or the guys come to mine to do this but obviously with Corona it's all online. 

She says fine, she is going to have a long bath and I can play my games. So I am on the computer in the study, I have a really nice set of active noice cancelling headphones and 3 screens. On the middle screen I have MTG on cockatrice online, right screen youtube listening to enter Shikari and talking to my friends on discord with the window on the left screen. Door is next to the right screen.

I have been playing for about 2h30min when my fiancée gets out of the bath and poses naked in the door to the study and says my name a few times. Gets absolutely nothing from me. She waits there for a few minutes and leaves. She comes back does the same again and still nothing. She is convinced I can see her as I am almost facing her and I am ignoring her on purpose. 

What is actually happening is that I can hear absolutely nothing because her voice is being actively cancelled by the headphones and the music which is playing. Plus MTG takes up literally all of the concentration I have to give. She is also not quite in my peripheral vision if I am looking at the middle screen. This line of reasoning is currently not the accepted sequence of events.

Now it's bed time and I am reluctant to bring up which room I am actually sleeping in tonight. (I'm sure I can talk my way out of it... right?)

TL:DR - I was so engrossed in online MTG with noise cancelling headphones on that I accidentally ignored my naked fiancée posing in the doorway twice and now I am in big trouble.

fsqpus,TheFlyingBandNerd,TIFU by making pasta,2,tifu,https://redd.it/fsqpus,2,"So I'm home from college on spring break, and because of social distancing I have a lot of extra time on my hands. So I thought hey, my family has a pasta roller attachment for our stand mixer, why don't I break that out for the second time ever and make some pasta.

Everything was going well, dough was made, rested, and ready to roll. I broke out the pasta rollers, and while wiping one down with a towel, attach it to the stand mixer on the counter. Time for fuck up #1. Running the roller I noticed that there is still pasta gunk (now wet). That's no problem, I'm holding a towel, and everyone knows that all you have to do in order to clean a spinning thing, all you have to do is run a towel over it. It will clean itself. 

KRRR! SNAP! Fuck.

The towel is now impossibly stuck inside the pasta roller. I pull, jab with a butter knife, and take the roller apart to no avail, until finally my dad comes and steps on the towel, ripping it apart. It is then, while I'm putting the roller back together that I realize that the bit that makes the roller spin is now broken. No problem, I'll just swap that with the same part from a different attachment. 

So now I'm set up again, and ready to move on with this God forsaken activity. I run the roller again, and realize that it's still dirty. Having now read the owners manual I know that I need to clean it with a brush. I find a brush, and start jamming it into the roller. Now if only this would turn and bring the gunk to me. So I turn the roller on.

KRRR! SNAP! Fuck.

It was stupid the first time. The second time it was down right moronic. Now I'm a jack ass with two broken pasta rollers and a lump of unrolled pasta dough. I would say that the pasta maker won, but in reality I beat my own ass through my idiocy. Safe to say, broken rollers aside, I will not be making pasta again.

fsmokp,hugedumbass000,TIFU not realizing my chairs height is adjustable and destroying my back for 4 years!,26,tifu,https://redd.it/fsmokp,2,"Posting this on an alt account since its too embarrassing of a story for my main account

Also apology for my English it is my 2nd language :)

 Somewhere around 2016 my neighbors had an office chair they were giving away for free and so of course I took the opportunity and got the chair

For the first 3 days I used it, it was very comfortable and I much preferred this office chair to the hard plastic chairs I previously had to sit on. One of my work friends came over to my house so that we could finish up a project. As he used the chair, he adjusted the height to make it taller since he is taller than I am.

A few days later my dumbass gets on to do some work and I notice something was wrong, but I disregarded it. It was quite painful to bend over and it caused my back a lot of pain to even work for 1 continuous hour.

My dumbass did this exact routine for 4 years. Not once in those 4 years did I think to purchase another chair, or perhaps inquire how to fix the one I had. I instead accepted it, and my back has paid the price.

Approximately 2 weeks ago my girlfriend also uses the chair and finds it too high for her too. I excitedly tell her that I have had the same problem for 4 years now and she looks at me like im joking but she realized that I am actually stupid as fuck. She quickly adjusts the chair back to it's original height and I fucking left the room and stared out of the window for something like 30 minutes questioning my intelligence

TL;DR; Bought new office chair, work friend adjusts it so it's higher, I accepted with it for 4 years despite sitting like that hurts my back. Girlfriend shows me that you can change the height of the chair.",1585693096.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fsmokp/tifu_not_realizing_my_chairs_height_is_adjustable/
fsj2uf,ExtendoClout,"TIFU by playing with my food, making my bosses think I was doing drugs",9603,tifu,https://redd.it/fsj2uf,369,"I was on my way to work and decided to stop at Tim Horton’s for some Timbits (donut holes for you Americans, it’s our Duncan Donuts up here). I got a mix of my favourites, plain no glaze and raspberry filled with icing sugar. I stuff the box into my lunch box and go to work. 

Time comes for my short break, so I decide to eat some of my Timbits. My coworker and I usually eat in the second cafeteria now to distance from other people, so we sit a few tables away from each other and try throwing the Timbits to catch in our mouths. 

I *missed* catching a raspberry timbit and it hit my upper lip, leaving the white icing sugar all around my nose area too. I wipe off what I thought was all of it, but clearly missed some spots under my nose my and my friend didn’t tell me. 

We go back to work, and this notorious snitch kept looking at me weirdly and I didn’t know why. Couple minutes later I get called to the boss’ office with no clue why. So I walk down to the office, and two of my supervisors are sitting with the big boss man. They all look PISSED. 

I sit down, and they start questioning me about why I’ve been at work so much more than normal working long hours (I’m a student and my classes are all online now, and I went from working 10-15hrs per week to 8-10 per day plus weekends). I tell them about my school being online and I have more time, but they don’t look like they’re buying it. Then they get right into it and ask me why I’m doing drugs at work, if I bought it here, and all the legal implications they’re going to have to take. 

I’m freaking out, as I don’t use any drugs in or out of work. I ask where this came from as I tell them I don’t use anything and would never at work, and one of them hands me a pocket mirror and tells me to look under my nose. I start laughing and explaining the timbit situation in the lunch room. They’re not buying it, so they tell me to wait in the room and they all leave. 

They go to watch the security footage, and Lo and behold they see us pelting each other with timbits, and me getting hit in the face. They come back in the room laughing, explaining how they’re sorry and that I should clean my nose better, and tell me I can head back to work. 

Up side to this? Got an extra 30 minute break from working.

Down side? Almost had a heart attack at 22.

TL:DR - Got timbits on my way to work, decided to try to throw and catch them in my mouth during break, leaving what looked like cocaine residue on my upper lip and under my nose. Got called to my boss’ office and almost got fired because they thought I was doing drugs until they reviewed the security footage.",1585681702.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fsj2uf/tifu_by_playing_with_my_food_making_my_bosses/

I was absolutely livid with my sister - she was lucky she was in the bathroom so I had time to calm down. I quickly filled the kitchen sink up with warm water, dunked my cat in, safe to say she was not happy getting drenched. She ended up scratching my mum (somehow I managed to get away unscathed). My other cat saw what was going on and started attacking me whilst I was holding my other cat in water while she was howling. 

My mum and sister are now laughing about it - I’m failing to see the funny side as of yet. My cat is fine now, I’m hoping I got all the bleach off. She’s currently sitting on a towel in front of the heater drying off.

froyrl,justcallmedudedude,TIFU by ignoring an odd feeling in my testicles,18265,tifu,https://redd.it/froyrl,808,"About a month ago, I started having this weird sensation in my testicles. Almost like a slight achy feeling. I figured it was blue balls and decided to wack off to alleviate it. Nope. Didn't work. Actually it made it hurt worse. I went online and looked up my symptoms and found things such as testicular torsion, epididymitis, testicular cancer (oh fuck), and many others. About a week later, I headed over to an urgent care clinic and spoke with a doctor about my symptoms. After a bunch of testing, the doctor told me it was nothing serious and that he would prescribe some ibuprofen for the pain. Doctor tells me if I feel any abdominal pain, to go to the nearest hospital. Ok, cool. So as many of you know, there has been a pandemic here in the States and many other parts of the world. Because of this, my primary care provider has been completely booked for quite some time and I can't get a hold of them no matter what. So here I am a month later, the pain is still there. It's starting to annoy me more than concern me at this point. But today, ohhhh today, in the worst way possible, I found out the problem. I started having this achy feeling on the left part of my abdomen. It had a slight burning feeling to it. But mostly achy. At the same time this is happening, my testicles are aching as well. Oh shit. So I head over to the hospital, anxious as hell, and talk to the receptionist about my issue. An hour later, I see the doctor. I tell him everything that's been going on. He does some tests and comes to me with the diagnosis: An inguinal hernia. Basically my intestine popped out and was poking at my testicles for the past month. So what do I have to do? I gotta have surgery soon. Obviously, not today.

TL;DR I ignored my testicle pain for a month and later found out that I had an inguinal hernia. Going to have surgery as soon as possible.

fsdkit,muddywaterz,TIFU by lying about whose gum that was,31,tifu,https://redd.it/fsdkit,8,"This happened a couple nights ago.

I had my girlfriend of a couple weeks come over for the first time and she got to see my room, cuz we were going to get down to the Netflix N Chillin.

Kinda snooped and it got awkward, but she is a bit more extrovert than me so it didn't make it weird. Keep in mind, before this was my room, it was my older sisters room. 

A couple days before she came over I had rearranged my room in preparation of this, and I didn't notice till this night that my sister had been spitting her gum out and attaching it above her bed frame. I didn't notice this because my TV was actually covering it, it's likely been there for years as my room has never even rearranged until she moved out

She saw this and kinda joked that I'm gross for doing that. I didn't bother to tell her that was actually, MY SISTER, because I didn't want to look nasty for still having her gum on my wall, so I said, ""yeah I need to stop doing that.""

Fuck where this came from, she plants her face into the gum and pulls it off the wall with her teeth. You can only imagine my face of disgust, WTFH. I was in shock as a string of gum was pulled from my wall to her mouth. I couldn't keep a straight face, I looked disgusted.

She giggled it off, and I said something among the lines of, ""uhh, you know I think that's been there for years you should spit it out."" To which she began chewing on the fucking thing.

Get this shit next, after trying to look cute she leaned in for a hug and tried to kiss me, to which I broke out in a ridiculous whooping cough, which gave me enough time to walk out of the room and go into my bathroom.

Didn't know how to tell her when I came back, so I didn't. And I probably never will.

fsmyfl,hull534,TIFU by making my dad think I ordered a huge dildo,85,tifu,https://redd.it/fsmyfl,15,"So my dad’s birthday is coming up and I (25F) thought  I’d be a lovely daughter and order him a bottle of his favourite Whiskey from Amazon. It arrived yesterday in the usual rectangular cardboard box Amazon ship bottles in and my dad signed for it and called me downstairs.

We’ve been in quarantine in our house (Northern England) for 3 weeks now and my dad is very strict about it... you can see where this is going. He basically orders me to open the box there and then in front of it saying “Corona lives on cardboard for a while so open it here and dispose of the box!” I didn’t want to open it obviously because it would ruin the surprise so I told him “No I don’t want to.” He told me again to open it and stressed why I needed to, I then said “No I don’t want to!” And he was like “why the hell not?!” So I said “because it’s private.”

Now I suck at lying and hiding things so I was flustered at this point. He suddenly also became flustered and was like “oh.. oh okay.. uhh just take it to your room and open it then dispose of the box and wash your hands... uhh okay..” I’d never seen him stutter or act flustered so I was confused... until it dawned on me that due to the box shape and my words, he thought I’d ordered some kind of huge dildo.

I am absolutely mortified. He’s gonna spend the next week thinking I own a giant dildo. Considering writing “NOT a dildo” on the gift tag.

I ordered my stuff and it arrives about an hour later. For those of you familiar with weed, I got Rolex OG which is a indica. Indica is usually used around night time to help with relaxation and muscle relaxation. Though, when I stared smoking it was 3PM. 

Around 3:45 PM yesterday I was so insanely baked and I put on some Alan Watts meditation to help focus on my life and some of my problems. 20 minutes later I was passed out. 

During my dreams I was at an ex girlfriends house and we were hanging out in her room. Yes, just hanging out you pervs of reddit. When we broke up irl, it wasnt clean and her family blames me and to this day hates my guts. If details are needed, let me know then see edit. 

Alright now to the fuck up. This morning (about an hour and 5 mins ago now) I woke up from said dream. It's dark as hell outside and I swear to you I was still baked. I had no idea where I was or what time it was. Eventually I found my phone and saw it was 4AM. ""Fuck man been sleeping for like, 10 hours"", I thought to myself. 

Me, being the genius I am, and still thinking about why I dreamt what I did, decided hey now is a perfect time to go for a walk. Before leaving the house though, I decided to pack up another bowl and smoke some. Genius. 

So now Im walking around my neighborhood stoned and just enjoying the night air. The street lights illuminating the parked cars underneath, the sound of nothingness as nature takes over during the nighttime. I was amazed at everything and got lost in my train of thoughts, wondering why we are who we are, and how to achieve ikigai. 

Next thing you know I'm back at my house and walk up to the front door to head inside. Doors locked. ""Hmm kinda weird"", my baked mind told me. I figured my grandma must have locked it behind me. So I start to knock. 

Turns out it wasn't my house. Nope not at all. You probably can guess where this is going by now. My stoned mind decided to walk to an ex girlfriends house at 4AM and knock on her door. 

Well guess who answered. Her dad. 

""What the hell are you doing here?? Do you know what time it is?!?"" 

""Sorry sir, I honestly dont know how I ended up here""

""Yoda_Only_One, I told you to stay the fuck away from my daughter""

""I wasn't trying to se-""

""Go the hell home!!"" And with that the door slams in my face. 

Well now that I'm back at reality, and wondering why in the world I walked there instinctively, I found my way to my actual home. You probably thought that would be the end of it huh? 

Cue once I get into bed and all warmed up. My phone buzzes and lights up my dark room. 

""Ex Girlfriend: Hey, ik we havent talked for a while, about time you tried to reach me""


TL;DR: Got stoned, passed out, walked to my ex girlfriends house at 4AM and had her dad slam the door in my face. Now she thinks I want her back

fsinu7,missjeri,TIFU by learning what screen mirroring on Apple TV is and flashing half my family.,33,tifu,https://redd.it/fsinu7,3,"So because of COVID-19, my brothers, my bf and I have been doing lots of movie nights in. As we were all gathered around the main TV deciding on what movie to watch and browsing Netflix, we got to talking about cancelled travel plans and how we all had the travel jitters now. BF and I mentioned our trip to Europe last year and my brothers ended up wanting to see some pics or videos of it. BF said he would just use screen mirroring on Apple TV and connect his phone to the big TV. We're all young adults and pretty close, so my brother made a small joke about being careful showing us things on the TV, incase bf had anything NSFW on his phone. We all laughed it off. 

Except me. My dumbass asked, ""what's screen mirroring?"" (because apparently I'm the only millennial who didn't know), prompting everyone to show me the dropdown button on my phone. I, of course, immediately pressed it. It automatically connected my phone to our main TV and my entire photo gallery showed up on screen. 

To make matters worse, I happened to be in my video gallery at the time, so amongst all the adorable videos of my cat, there was a very obvious video frame of my bf's dick in me raw👍. My brothers are pretty chill so they pretended they didn't see it and chatted along while my bf did an uncomfortable laugh and told me how to shut it off. 

We ended up watching Silence of the Lambs since I had never seen it. 9/10 movie. 0/10 dumbass fumble by me.

fsn6lt,Dovahbears,TIFU by almost going blind from fingering my girlfriend,37,tifu,https://redd.it/fsn6lt,12,"Obligatory this wasn't today, but has been ongoing for the past week or so. 

I have a long-distance girlfriend so it should go without saying that when we do get together, there's quite a bit of... heavy pettin'. The only issue is that my gf has type 2 herpes, and it just so happened that during the short time we had together she had a flair up (the stress from a global pandemic certainly didn't help). As such we avoid any mouth or *penile* contact, but as a self-described feminist, I feel it's my duty to make sure she still has a good time. So we did a lil disco in the dark, I leave for home and everything seems fine. That was up until about 6 days ago. I wake up one morning and quite literally can't look at any source of light without intense pain, nausea, and watering in my left eye. After calling my primary care doctor they tell me to see an ophthalmologist immediately. Next thing you know I'm in their office (my mom drove me while I wore two pairs of sunglasses) and having a metric shit ton of numbing eye drops poured into my eyes so that the Dr can shine a light into my eye. Lo' and behold, the doctor tells me I have a plethora of cold sores.... in my eye. Up until this point, I had no idea that ocular herpes existed. This is only worsened by the fact that my gf had incessantly coached me not to touch my face with the current rona crisis. So what did i do? Rubbed vaginal fluids all over my cornea. Thankfully today for the first time I can actually look at a computer screen, which has allowed me to type this.

fs93q7,TcpAckFrequency,TIFU By not muting myself in an online class,28617,tifu,https://redd.it/fs93q7,869,"So, I have a parrot and online classes. We are not required to have video in the online class, so we just connect our microphones. Today, my bed, was extremely comfortable. As I got up at 10 am to join the online meeting in Zoom, my bed started calling me. I fucking felt it. I joined, and didn't mute myself. Normally I'd mute myself because I have a parrot. My parrot is an Indian Ringneck, and those bastards are loud as fuck. I decided to fall asleep through the whole class as my bed felt so good.  Only after I woke up an hour after the class I realised I was still in the meeting with an unmuted microphone. I texted one of my classmates and they told me they couldn't have a normal class, and the teacher didn't know how to kick me out. They also said they tried talking with the parrot, they told me he said ""Hello"" and ""What you doing"" and then proceeded to repeat ""ok"" for the duration of the class. 

TLDR: I joined my online class, forgot to mute myself, slept, and my parrot was screaming all throughout it.

EDIT: Talked with my teacher to explain her what the hell was going on and she told me she hadn't muted me because she wanted to have fun with the parrot. I guess teachers can get lonely in such depressing times.

When I set the timer on our oven, I frequently, spontaneously 'remember' to check on whatever's cooking and get to the oven just before the alarm.  Of course I loudly pronounce how I could be a Michelin star chef with such impeccable timing and instinct for when things are cooked etc. etc. I also made this pronouncement in front of friends, and family, quite frequently.

 I realised, today, that the alarm beeps once 60 seconds before the main alarm goes off; I've probably just been hearing that and not realising.  

I don't know if my wife knew this fact. and A. thought I was making a dad-joke, or B. thought I was an idiot but humoured me, and it's far too late to ask.

fsqkt4,S43V10,TIFU by sleeping through all my meetings,5,tifu,https://redd.it/fsqkt4,4,"So title pretty much sums it up, but my sleep schedule has been really messed up due to quarantine. I’ve been sleeping later and later every day and napping at odd times throughout the day. Over the weekend I slept at 6 and 7am respectively. I wanted to fix my sleeping pattern so last night I took an over the counter sleeping pill that I’ve taken before. It’s supposed to be 2 pills but I only took one because last time I took the full dosage I was groggy and drowsy all day. So I took it and set my alarms and I went to sleep. 

I woke up feeling nice thinking it was a little before 10ish and it was like 2:30pm. I missed 5 meetings, a ton of messages from my manager and project managers, people calling me concerned thinking I was sick or maybe went outside during the stay at home order and got in trouble with the police or something. Nope. Slept through all of it.  

My manager is cool so I didn’t lie or make up an excuse or anything but he was definitely annoyed. I told him what happened and he didn’t respond. I also said I’d work until about 9pm and still put a whole days effort in. He messaged me at around 8:30 saying “please be at XXXX meeting tomorrow morning. I’ll speak to you tomorrow”. So that’s great. I don’t think it’ll be too bad because he’s a nice and understandable guy, I’m just annoyed at myself I guess.

fsqouq,saturatedhydrocarbon,TIFU by doing a fireball enema,3,tifu,https://redd.it/fsqouq,0,"So I'm pretty intolerant to drinking alcohol. It always makes me feel really ill and I've only gotten drunk without throwing up once. I came across boofing on the internet, had to type the term into urban dictionary, and did a quick google to figure out if it was even possible with alcohol. Apparently you have to be really careful so you don't get alcohol poisoning and die. I was like, sounds good to me! The only alcohol I had last night was some fireball, so I went out looking for an enema bottle. CVS was closed, and I went to two grocery stores that didn't have any. I decided to improvise and grab a sriracha bottle with a screw off top with an inch long tip on it. I took it home, washed it out with soap and water, and filled it about 1/6 full with fireball, lubed it up, got on my hands and knees, put it in my butt, and squeezed. Some of it came out and dripped down and tingled a little, but the fireball that actually made it into my butt was another story. It felt cold and hot at the same time, and I actually accidentally yelled out from the burn. It's what I imagine putting gasoline up your ass would feel like. It took a little while to get it all in, and I stayed in that position for 5 minutes so it wouldn't immediately come out. I didn't squeeze it out, I just waited for about 10 more minutes. I thought it was supposed to be immediate, and I barely felt anything, so I decided to do it again. I put a little more fireball into the bottle and repeated the whole process. I was starting to feel like I was on the verge of having explosive diarrhea. My colon was stuffed like it had never been before. I get ready for a while (I was supposed to have a date over) until I started to feel thirsty. I got up and walked to the kitchen and I was feeling a little tipsy. By the time I finished my glass of water and a snack I was drunk beyond belief. I stumbled back to my room with no thought of my former plans. I couldn't even use my phone because I literally couldn't read anything on the screen, so I pretty much just rolled around for about an hour in moderate discomfort until I fell asleep. I woke up hours later, and my butt felt like it was about to explode. I hobbled to the bathroom and out came about a gallon of liquid which thankfully didn't burn on the way out, but it came with a ton of cramping. I went back to bed but had to get up every 30 minutes or so. I felt like I had taken a bunch of laxatives and my intestines were also tied into knots. I felt like I was shitting tiny little rabbit shits, and each one came with a major cramp that felt like they radiated up my intestines. It's 24 hours later and I still feel like I took a monster cock up the ass. But I didn't throw up!

I read forums. 

I watched minutes of YouTube videos. 

I adjusted my trackpad settings. 

I adjusted my mouse settings. 

I uninstalled and reinstalled drivers. 

I checked my BIOS to make sure my trackpad wasn't disabled. 

I even thought about returning my computer and getting a new one, but alas, I had not opted to go with the optional warranty through Amazon and the one that came with the computer had expired. 

I called an electronics repair store and got a quote, way too expensive.

I finally broke down and just bought a Bluetooth mouse. This was a great solution until the Bluetooth mouse stopped working as well at which point I looked down at my computer and realized that if I pushed FN+F7 I could re-enable my trackpad which I had inadvertently turned off by fat-fingered button pressing two years ago.

fsgib5,13th_Duke,TIFU by cutting my penis in front of my daughter,21,tifu,https://redd.it/fsgib5,5,"Early Saturday morning a few years back, the wife was out of the house and I had the kids. I’d promised them to go out for brunch and they were very excited. As the morning progressed I had to take a shower before leaving and quickly jumped into the shower. 

The kids were busy playing but I left the bathroom door open to ensure I could hear them in case something would happen. While showering I shaved and had the idea to do some lower body grooming as well wanting to look my best for what might be in store later on. 

As I was shaving away the shower curtain was suddenly pulled aside and my daughter goes “whatcha doing!?”, completely startling me. A few seconds I can see on her face that something is wrong and she asks “why is there red coming from your penis?”. At this point I hadn’t noticed that I’d run the razor horizontally across my member when she frightened me. Moments later I feel a stinging pain, there was noticeable gash and there’s indeed blood mixed with water flowing down my legs. My daughter looked absolutely horrified and on the brink of crying. 

I stumble out of the shower to grab a towel with blood dripping on the floor. I managed to find a “Dora the Explorer” bandaid and do my best to patch “it” up. I had a lot of questions to answer throughout the day.

For weeks I was mortified of the thought of the kids bringing this up in conversation with daycare workers, neighbors etc.

Then she goes on a rant saying we should be more like North Korea?? That people shouldn’t be allowed to live if they’re so careless??
So I try to level with her saying she should probably dial it back, this anger is no better than fear, etc etc. I offer that other countries are on the upswing and the U.S. will get it’s shit together somehow... yada yada.

She’s still on one though, and so my inner leftist gets frustrated and I start to break her down a bit by calling out for the last few weeks she’s acted difficult, critical, hard to talk to. 
We shift gears, then in a classic mom moment she asks me if I at least put in my grocery deliver order (in Philly everything’s booked days out so I had to wait til midnight to order for next week !)
But it was the Way she asked it... something I really didn’t need in the middle of so much frustration ya’ll.

So I slipped and said fuck you to my mom. She won’t text back guys I feel terrible :(

Once I logged into Zoom I got the screen notification saying ""Your Prof will let you into the lecture shortly"", which was kind of weird because I was late. But I assumed that he too, was running late.

After waiting to be let into the meeting for 20 minutes I texted a friend to see if she also had the ""please wait to be let in"" notification. She said no, the class had started, and she sent me a screenshot of her desktop. And there was my prof teaching his virtual class.

At first I thought my prof was being a prick and not letting me in because I requested to join 15 minutes late. I was dead wrong.

Turns out, when I tried to join the meeting, my display name came up as Dixie Normus, or Dicks Enormous (I changed my name last week for a different Zoom meeting and totally forgot to change it back) and my prof decided not to let good old Dixie join the zoom meeting.

I was way too embarrassed to change my display name back and rejoin the call because my prof would know it was me being a colossal jackass. So I just had a good laugh and started doing other work instead.

fsfp8w,JonOfNoTrades,"TIFU by giving the name of a transgender pornstar (instead of a musician) to an Elementary teacher (vaguely NSFW, but not really)",54,tifu,https://redd.it/fsfp8w,2,"  

Sorry if the formatting is weird. This is my first time posting something this long on reddit.

I know, quite a title. I myself don’t watch trans porn, but let’s not be assholes in the comments. To each their own. The world doesn’t need more judgmental assholes, it needs more understanding people.   

TLDR at the bottom

Obligatory “this didn’t happen today” statement. It actually happen back in 2014, but a picture on facebook made me remember the event. So here it goes..

Back in 2014 I was going through college to become an English teacher. During this time, quite a few of my friends were either also becoming teachers or were teachers already. One of them was the victim of this particular misunderstanding. We’ll call her TF for Teacher Friend. TF is a music teacher at a local elementary school. The way it works at this elementary school (or maybe all of them, I’m not sure), is that they don’t go to different classes for different subjects. They have one classroom, with one teacher, who teaches them for every subject. Every subject except for music. For one class-period, the teaching assistants will take the students to the music room and leave the teacher behind for time to clean and prepare for the next lesson. When they’re done, they take the children back to their classroom. At this point, the music teacher has about 10 minutes before the next class arrives for the next period. This is when our fuckup occurred.

At this time, the TF’s school was trying a new approach towards music class. They were trying to encourage the children to listen to more music at home and to play music at home. Each child was given a ukulele that was part of their music class. They were taught some basic chords and would practice singing and playing at the same time. TF wanted to introduce them to the idea of “covering” songs. For non-musicians out there, covering a song is basically playing someone else’s song as a performance. If I play “Let It Be” by the Beatles in my bedroom, I’m just playing it. If I play it at an open mic night, I’m covering it. TF had an idea to show them different YouTubers whose channels were just for cover songs. If she could get them interested in the musicians, maybe they would try harder/enjoy covering songs more. 

Here is the fuckup. When she told us this, I got really excited. I’m an English teacher, but I’m also an avid musician. I follow quite a few different music channels on YouTube and at the time she told us this I had just found a new, cool musician: Madilyn Bailey. Not Morgan Bailey.

In the excitement to tell her about this new musician I found that would be perfect for her idea, I had a complete brain-fart and switched her name from Madilyn to Morgan. 

The next day, I was outside my 9 am class waiting for the teacher to arrive when I got a text from TF. She was asking what the name was again for that musician I told her the last night. As soon as she asked that I realized that I had given her the wrong name, so I just replied “Madilyn Bailey, why?” She replied with “ooooh, I misremembered. Thanks!”

I know, I lied. I still kind of feel bad about that one.

Apparently, TF’s first class had just left and in the 10-ish minutes before the next class arrived, she decided to check out some musicians and begin making a playlist. She googled “Morgan Bailey”. Nothing popped up. She then googled “Morgan Bailey videos” and nothing popped up.

Later that day, before her last class-period started, she got a call from the principle asking her to visit the office after the last class ended. Apparently the safe-search function had prevented anything from popping up but it had alerted the I.T. admin. She explained to her principle who she was actually trying to google and the 2 of them ended up just laughing it off. No harm, no foul. Unfortunately, she did not have a great relationship with the other admin that worked there, so she ended up getting a mark on her record that she “viewed pornography while at work”. Which is obviously bullshit.

She did manage to get that mark repealed by going over the admin’s head to some higher-ups. But obviously that didn’t help her relationship with her school admin. Thankfully however, she has since switched schools to the school her principle switched to and doesn’t have to deal with them anymore.

TLDR: I gave a teacher friend the name Morgan Bailey instead of Madilyn Bailey. She got a mark on her record for googling a transgender pornstar while at work.",1585671081.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fsfp8w/tifu_by_giving_the_name_of_a_transgender_pornstar/

Buuuuut it turns out I accidentally texted my husband instead of my sister about himself farting. He opens the text and shows it to me. I am utterly confused for a moment about how he has this text. Then it registers that I texted him making fun of him and I start cracking up even harder. My pregnant self not slightly, but COMPLETELY loses bladder control. 

Now, every time I make fun of my husband, he says “are you gonna text me about it?” Or, alternatively, “are you gonna pee about it?”

Yes, I know, I’m a complete fucking idiot. Let’s just get that out of the way from the start. My only defense was that I was a teenager in the 90's at the time, and my dick was doing most of the thinking for me. On the whole, I’m a reasonably intelligent guy. My dick however, is much like one of those morons you meet who is all balls, no brains. Despite the fact that thinking with my dick got me through highschool at the top of my class, it has proven itself repeatedly to have no memory, no conscience, and what I will simply classify as “questionable moral fiber”.

An obscure, late 20th century English philosopher known for his ballistic dentition once said  “Dicks have drive and clarity of vision. They’re not clever.” and he was correct. But like most people who are all balls and no brains, that kind of decision making invariably leads to collecting good stories, and occasionally being scarred for life.

This is one of those good stories, and it’s about a scar.

I was sixteen, vacuously stupid, and the world as I knew it revolved entirely around my radiant affections for one hell of an awesome girl. She was short, beautiful, built like a soccer player, and had curves in all the right places. Miraculously, she was also my steady girlfriend. We had a magnificent system that involved a standing weekly date. This almost always consisted of exactly three things: dinner, a movie, and the furious, passionate, awkward sex that only inexperienced young lovers can have in the contorsionistic confines of an automobile.

Good times.

On the right day of the week you could catch a 2nd run movie at the Alpine Twin for just a couple bucks. Urban sprawl hadn’t reached far enough yet to consume all the best spots for privacy, and we knew every one of them. It was a great time to be young and in love.

God is not without a sense of humor, however, and one particular week fate would throw me a curve. A movie had just come out that her father wanted to see. In a tormentative moment of parental schadenfreude, they decided it would be a great idea to join us on our weekly movie night for a wholesome double date. 

I was trapped. I couldn’t say no, her dad was a towering giant of brooding scowls who instilled the fear of God in me. He was an incredibly kind and funny man, but he commanded my respect and there was absolutely no doubt he held the fate of my love life at his whim. I was a nerdy, country kid from the wrong side of the tracks and he made it very clear that I was dating his daughter only so long as both her and him deemed that acceptable. She adored me, he tolerated me, and it was my lowly position to be grateful for the opportunity.

I was fine with that. I was spending every Saturday night with her sowing my wild oats, and going to church every Sunday with him praying for crop failure.

So we all met at her house, the whole family piled into their car, and off we went. We didn’t go to our comfortable, low-budget, second-run theatre out on the north end of town with the thin crowds that encouraged sitting towards the back well away from anyone who could see wandering hands and notice the whispers of young lovers. We went out to the fancy first-run theatre, the gigantic cineplex and shining star of the lower west side, Studio 28, where we would be packed side by side with strangers and held to much higher standards of socially acceptable behaviour.

Studio 28 was massive. Thousands of people filled its acres of parking lots and watched the latest movies on twenty different massive screens with reclining seats in air conditioned comfort. One movie cost more than what we would spend for a month's worth of dates at Alpine - including food. But her dad was funding the entire expedition and I was happy to just be with her.

My lovely girlfriend however, was a hormone-driven, devious genius, and happened upon a simple idea that changed my life forever. She noticed that they list not only the start times of the movies, but the duration as well.

It had never for a moment crossed my mind that we didn’t all have to go to the same movie. Studio 28 was so massive that not only did they have a ton of different movies playing, many of them shared the same start times. She found a completely different show to catch, sorted out the details with her dad, and off we went on our own. She had stared into the bleakness and brilliantly wrought forth for us the greatest commodity of young lovers who live with their parents: privacy.

For such a monumental day in my life, I don’t even remember what the movie was. But I do remember spending an hour and a half in the dark getting each other as worked up as we dared. The lines of socially acceptable behaviour were a lot tighter back then, but we were enjoying them to the best of our youthful ability.

Our movie got out, and we made the long walk to the back-forty of the parking lot hand in hand and hopped in the car. We had no concrete idea when her parents' movie would get out, so we were just hanging out, waiting, and of course sharing only the most chaste and pure of good Christian thoughts.

Just her, me, and our collective sexual tension that burned with the power of a supernova. It really was only a matter of time before it all reached criticality.

Because sitting in a glass bubble in the middle of a thousand cars is totally the best possible place to be doing such things. I was a little on edge, but that didn’t stop her. It certainly did, however, limit our options.

The good news was that I at least had a clear line of sight all the way up our row, and would easily see anyone approaching from the theatre. I kept a watchful lookout, and she decided to take action.

In a matter of a few seconds, she was sucking my dick like it was filled with her father’s acceptance. Not a moment later, I saw the crowd of people start pouring out of the theatre doors. It didn’t take me long to spot her parents, hand in hand. Her dad’s bright blue shirt stuck out in the crowd, even though they were still a quarter-mile away.

And then, at that exact moment, is when I fucked up. 

That’s when I did one of the dumbest things in my entire life; I made a split-second trivial decision that would leave me scarred forever.

Now, what I could have done is simply reach down, gently pull her head out of my lap, and have a mildly disappointing end to some fun, gone on with my day, and been just fine. Hell, given how far away they were, the hair-trigger of a teenage boy, and her skillful abilities we could have likely finished without pushing our luck.

The problem with wisdom is that you don’t get it until five seconds after you need it.

What I did, in a moment of youthful stupidity, was say “Your dad’s coming!” and sit up straight in my seat.

And that, my dear reader, is the exact moment that shit got real.

Please understand that what I’m about to describe is much like a car crash. It will take me far longer to describe it than it took to actually happen. All of this transpired in just a moment, but that moment is burned into my brain forever. I apologise now, that it shall be burned into yours. When you share this story with your friends, you’ll know they got to this part when you see them adjust themselves in their seat. No man is immune to this effect.

In one smooth powerful movement driven by pure reflex and fear, without a moment’s conscious thought, she snapped her head up, bolted upright in her seat, and while making that transition from laying on me to sitting next to me she stuffed my dick back into my jeans and ran that fuckin zipper all the way home with the power of an angry linebacker.

The problem is I had never unbuttoned my pants, and it was a lot smaller when it came out ten minutes ago than it was when she decided to cram it back in through, what was now, much too short of a hole. She fought it in there in half a second, it just wasn’t situated as well as it needed to be.

Then, with the delicate touch of a bricklayer she had yanked that zipper though several inches of my most delicate sensitivities and made me one with my Levi’s. 

It happened in the blink of an eye.

I was absolutely convinced I was going to die.

The pain was far worse than what you imagine right now. It was radiant and consuming. She had caught roughly…very roughly...the entire front of the most sensitive skin I own and interlaced it down nearly the full length of the zipper. I could glimpse a thin line poking out the front, and there was nothing I could do about it but sit there with tears running down my face and her parents approaching.

She immediately knew what had happened, subtlety is not a skill I possess even on my best days. I think it may be when I levitated, shooting to the ceiling, howling in pain that she got her first hint that something was wrong. She was mortified, I was in agony, and the shitshow had just begun. I untucked my shirt to cover the obvious injury, and wiped my tears.

It was hard travel across the great prairies of the parking lot. I heard they lost five good men, and at one point had to start eating the horses to survive. But eventually, months later, her parents finally made it to the car.

The first battle was the parking lot. Several hundred people had all gotten out when we did and had to find their way to the exit. It took half an hour of stop and start agony while we all shuffled into place and trickled out onto 28th street - a bustling busy main thoroughfare of the lower-west side.

And the fun was just beginning.

Florida makes oranges, Idaho makes Potatoes, and Hollywood makes movies. But Michigan, we make potholes. Northbound 131 is a washboard of suspension testing craters that can knock your teeth loose. Because of the complicated interaction of freeze-thaw cycles, capillary action of water retention in asphalt, and the fact that we run snow plows for a third of the year there is a regular pattern of patched sections on the highway spaced at predictable intervals for miles on end.

And I felt every one of those sonsabitches as we launched and bounded from pock to pock, all along  my dick.
 
It took about thirty minutes to get from Studio28 to their house. That was the longest half hour of my life. I felt every bump in the road in between my own heartbeats as I throbbed in agony sitting awkwardly in the back seat. The only saving grace was that her and her mom were making small talk about the movies they had each seen and my opinion didn’t matter. I sat there sniffling and rubbing my swollen, red eyes. When her mom asked me if I was okay I uttered the only word I could manage on the entire ride home.

“Allergies”.

We made it to her parent’s house, said our goodbyes, and she walked me across the street to my car. It took more work to get into my mom’s old boxy beige Pontiac Grand Prix than it did to get out of her parent’s SUV, but I made it, tenderly.

Mission two accomplished, her parents had no idea. So that crisis was averted.

Now, I had to choose. I was on the edge of The City. If I went East, I could fight my way through traffic to the giant gleaming state-of-the-art hospital located right downtown and wait in line in the emergency room. If I went West, I was heading towards home and in my own small country town was a little Med Center staffed with only a handful of people whose main job was helping people with minor bumps and bruises, and keeping the critical patients alive long enough for the ambulance to get there and haul them off to one of the much larger neighboring cities.

I headed towards home. It was farther, but faster. I hopped on I-96 and blasted into the night more scared of hitting a deer than being pulled over for speeding. I figured if any cop pulled me over, all I had to do was show him my situation and there wasn’t a man in the world who would fault me for being in a hurry. I had a much higher chance of getting a police escort to the Med Center than getting a ticket, so off I went as fast as Mom’s old Pontiac would carry me.

I arrived without incident and walked gingerly through the front door. I’d never been to the Med Center before. My parents were on the rescue squad of the local volunteer fire department so anything short of a sucking chest wound in my house was dealt with by someone running for the jump-bag in Dad’s truck. Any sort of injury was handled on only the best of equipment: the kitchen table.

Life’s different in a small town.

That’s why I wasn’t even slightly surprised when I walked in the front door and the triage nurse at the front counter stopped typing, looked me straight in the eye with genuine concern on her face and said “Chris, are you ok?”.

It was my mom’s friend. Not only did this woman know me, she’d known me since I had training wheels on my bike. I knew she was a Nurse. Half the women in my world were Nurses, my mom was a Nurse. She worked at a nursing home filled with other Nurses. How the hell was I supposed to remember that one of her best friends just so happened to work at the Med Center.

I should have gone East.

“No Ma’am” I said, and quickly added, wincing, “please don’t tell my Mom”

“What happened, show me what you did”

Now, I grew up around trauma and emergency medicine. Back then they were dispatched with one-way pagers the size of a brick that looked like walkie-talkies. There was only one channel for the whole county, and every department had its own unique series of musical tones that told us who the message was for. It squawked and whistled all day and night and you never even noticed it.

But when the BEEDEEBEEDEEBEEDEEBEEDEE-DOOOOOOOOO-----DEEEEEEEEEEEE sound that designated our unit came over that radio, it would take you out of a dead sleep before they got to the “COOPERSVILLE UNIT TWO-OH-FIVE” part of the message and Mom, Dad, or sometimes both, were headed out the door on a dead run before it stopped talking. 

If this happens while you’re out somewhere with Dad in the truck, you’re along for the ride. It was somewhere around age twelve when “stay in the truck” just didn’t work for me anymore. I’d learned where babies came from by watching a screaming Asian woman have one on the tailgate of a Subaru in the McDonald’s parking lot. I’d seen bodies mangled and I knew first hand why they called the people who ride crotch-rocket motorcycles “Organ Donors”. I’d learned the smartest and most heroic humans alive fly in AeroMed, and I knew that rescue crews have no problem working up to their elbows in your blood and then going out for pizza half an hour later. It’s just meat.

I was also well aware that the strongest, hardest, most stoic, most unimaginably un-fucking-fazed woman you’ll ever meet, is a Triage Nurse.

So I lifted up my shirt.

And, for just a moment, I saw her humanity crack through her professional stoicism.

I pray that you go your entire life and never once hear a Triage Nurse say “Oh Dear” when she looks at whatever injury you have. It’s up there with getting a prostate exam and hearing the Doctor behind you say “Aw, fuck!”. You don’t want any part of this situation.

There was no paperwork, and my ass never touched one of the beige plastic chairs in the tiny waiting room. She stood up and walked me through the door behind the counter and ten seconds later I was sitting on the crinkly butcher paper of an examination table with my legs dangling over the edge.

A Nurse who was only ten minutes older than I was came in just a moment behind me. Thankfully, I didn’t know her at least, but I’d have liked to under different circumstances. She held a BP cuff in one hand and a clipboard in the other and asked me how I was feeling and if I had any allergies. We chatted for perhaps a whole minute before she asked me what was wrong.

I lifted my shirt.

She took it well, just a tiny gasp before she got her shields back in place. But her blush betrayed her. She held tight to her professionalism and assured me that the Doctor would be right in as she stumbled gracefully backwards out of the room. However, I did notice that she never did get my BP, temp, or anything else.

The Doctor was indeed, right in. I had been sitting there less than five minutes when he strolled into the room and said “So, I hear you’ve had an interesting evening.”

He pulled up a little rolling stool, put on a pair of gloves, and scooted up for a front row seat between my knees as I sat sideways off the edge of the table. We discussed how I had gotten myself into this situation, and he surveyed the damage. I found it ironic that the one person who had shared this experience with me and who could truly appreciate what I was going through was the one person who was completely at ease with the situation. Of course…..it wasn’t his dick.

It was also the first time I’d gotten a real look at things myself, and it was worse than I’d imagined. The skin on the bottom of my shaft was peeking out through the golden teeth of the zipper all the way from about a half inch above the bottom of the zipper to the top. There was way more blood than I had noticed at first and it had stained my pants several inches in every direction. The total zipped length was nearly five inches, and it was under tension on the inside because the standard response to pain is for your dick to shrink up like a stack of dimes.

The added effect, because my brain is an asshole, was that the pain just intensified once I got a look at it.

He pulled out a pair of trauma shears and we discussed what he was going to do about half a second before he did it with a running commentary. He planned on cutting my pants off around the zipper. I was fine with this, off is good, let’s get this off - free me from my golden restraints good Doctor!

Deftly, gently, and with surprising ease the shears sliced right through the seams and folds of my jeans. He cut the bottom through several layers of denim and seams straight up to the base of the zipper, and sheared off either side about four inches away, leaving me with two flaps joined only by the teeth of the zipper and the button on top. He spun on his wheels, reached in the third drawer behind him, pulled out a pair of cutters like I would have in my toolbox, and snipped off the bottom half-inch of zipper entirely. It fell to the floor and landed with a wet plop.

He gently unbuttoned what was now a much smaller piece of my pants, and examined it closely for a couple minutes with a flap held in either hand.

Then he said something you never, ever, want to hear any manner of medical professional say to you.

“We’re gonna go on three...”

We’re…..WHAT!? Where? Whatthefuckare...

“One”

There was no motherfucking Two. Three was an outright lie.

The way out was as blindingly fast and traumatic as the way in. The entire process was loud, a wild blur of motion, and terrifying. In what I have absolutely no doubt was a process he had experienced before, he tore apart the two halves of my zipper with the haymaker strength of a farm boy and kicked himself away from the side of my examination table with both feet to send himself rocketing backwards across the tiny room well clear of the wild reflexive punch I swung through the space his head had occupied a split second before. He landed in a heap, half fallen off his rolling stool, with a piece of my jeans in either hand and an accomplished smile from ear to ear.

That all happened in less than a second. It took exactly the amount of time it took me to say “MOTHERFUCK-....eh?”

The good side is, it didn’t actually hurt all that much when he did that. The bad side was, the blood was now rushing to my dick and it was throbbing with every heartbeat. It hurt like all hell.

We both took a moment to compose ourselves and both spoke at the same moment, saying the exact same thing.

“Are you alright?”

I looked at the sad strip of hamburger laying in my lap, surrounded by a terrifying amount of dried blood in matted black hair. It looked like Edward Scissorhands had given me an old fashioned.

“No?”

I had visions of sutures, staples, and all forms of Spanish Inquisition cock torture that I was about to endure and was blissfully thankful that all he needed to do was clean everything off and tape a strip of gause to it. After the most unpleasant experience I’ve ever had involving my dick being cleaned, complete with being hosed down with Betadine, now it I just looked like I’d fucked an Oompa Loompa. 

I asked what would happen if I got a hardon, would I bleed to death or something? He assured me that the last thing I was going to get in the immediate future was an erection. After a few days it would be fine all on its own.

I thanked him for saving my manhood, secured my pants with my belt, hid the giant square hole in front under my shirt, and headed home. I tossed my shredded jeans in the trash, took a shower that involved the creative application of a baggie and a rubber band that moments before had been holding the wing on my model airplane. 

He was right, I didn’t have any danger of getting a hardon for over a week. The throbbing pain became a dull ache that would hover just on the edge of being actively conscious of it. Sleeping was complicated, but I managed. After a few days it didn’t hurt at all, and a couple weeks later I was back to normal. In the third week a full operational test proved that all repairs had been completed and that all systems were operating within nominal specifications.

But it’ll be a cold day in hell before I let a woman zip me up again. I’ll take care of that on my own, thank you.

The scar is considerable, tapering to half an inch wide at the base and running front and center along the bottom of my shaft up to the tip. It’s been the topic of more conversations and won more stupid bets than I want to think about. But it’s part of me, a part of my life, and I’m just thankful that despite the relentless abuse and poor decisions my dick has endured, that all in all, things are working just as they should thanks to the compassionate care of a young country Doctor and a small team of Nurses.

Thank you to everyone in the medical profession, of any rank and stripe, for enduring all that you do to help us fumbling idiots live to see another sunrise. You are awesome.

With my kindest regards,
cb
