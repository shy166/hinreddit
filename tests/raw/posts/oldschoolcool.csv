 The famed Beatles icon Sir Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band had to postpone their spring 2020 North American tour to 2021 due to concerns over coronavirus.

Originally,[ **the spring tour was slated to begin**](https://www.ticketnews.com/2019/11/ringo-starr-and-his-all-star-band-plot-2020-tour/) on May 29 in Rama, Ontario, followed by gigs in cities like New York City, Bangor, Boston, Philadelphia, and Atlanta before wrapping-up in Clearwater, Florida late June. However, due to the coronavirus global pandemic, the trek has been moved to 2021; dates will now kick-off with a to-be-announced pair of gigs in Rama, followed by shows across the East Coast before wrapping-up on June 27, 2021 in Clearwater.

My goal is to eventually release the episode up-scaled to 720p and color corrected.  I am going to also try to clean up any individual frames I can (dirt, grain, noise, scratch, line, compression artifacts, etc.).

I am using the German DVD source and have all frames dumped and about half of the frames up-scaled to 720.  The frames are separated into 'scenes' to aid in proper color correction, white balancing, and noise reduction as well.  I have only edited a hand full of the frames to manually remove damage however.

The first half of the episode is available but is not the full quality I am aiming for.  I am asking for suggestions to make this project better.  Just remember that the quality of the available sources are not the best and that I am just a hobbyist and a fan doing this with mostly free and open source software.",0,1584835881,https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/fmq5hi/misfits_of_science_1985_w_dean_paul_martin/,OldSchoolCool,1

fmidnw,Pazltron,Spanish Flu 1918-1920," From January 1918 to December 1920, a deadly influenza outbreak infected 500 million people across the world. Estimates suggest between 50 and 100 million people died from the virus, in other words, up to 5% of the planet’s population. It killed more people than any other illness in recorded history, more even than the total number of deaths in World War of 1914.

 **Why “Spanish”?** To maintain morale, wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Papers were free to report the epidemic’s effects in neutral Spain (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII). This created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit, thereby giving rise to the pandemic’s nickname, “Spanish flu”.

[This is my darling friend, Esther Loeb \(the thinner lady\) and her sister after being held in a Siberian forced labor camp during the Holocaust.  Shortly after 1939 her family escaped to Russia from German-occupied Poland, only to be caught by the Russian army and sent to Siberia. It was so cold they had to cover their mouths lest their lungs, mouth, and throat freeze. They lost their father to pneumonia and a newborn baby brother to starvation in the camp. Her story is amazing \(Google her!\) and too much to put here.  Esther would become an activist and fiery speaker in her later years. It was rare she slept without nightmares, especially after a speaking engagement when she awoke screaming. But she had a sly wit and could make me laugh! I miss her every day. Shalom, my darling Esther. \(Photo is in the Esther Loeb collection, U.S. Holocaust Museum\). ](https://preview.redd.it/9jdt589bqon41.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b70c73389aaf56a762fce99b965ddeba8e0d935)",2,1584648682,https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/flgukx/my_friend_esther_loeb_her_sister_landsberg/,OldSchoolCool,3

I hope this is the right place to post this, at the least hopefully it can begin some nostalgia and share some classic photos

My name is George &amp; I’m an Editorial Design Student from London. I have been working on a Hip Hop publication as part of my final brief. It focuses on the ‘Golden Years’ mainly in Compton &amp; Brooklyn with a few exceptions. So far I have features on Big L, Nas, 2pac, TLC and Ice Cube, this is the first chapter.

The Second and third chapters are where I need your help.

2 - ‘Photographic Narrative’ Any photos you have of that era/location. Anything that shows of the culture/fashion/mood of the time is great, social situations are perfect, where did everyone hang out?

3 Is an interview segment. I have prepared questions prepared to be answered in whatever detail you see fit. I want to know about the city, the political setting, the crime, the music, anything you feel relevant. 

With all this free time we have at the moment I think its nice to share something, if anyone is interested message me of reply to this with your photos/whatever you like really. 

Anyone that gets featured will be credited and at the very least will be sent a full PDF of the magazine, if it picks up I will think about posting physical copies.
