fsfdvj,__Augustus_,I'm 17 and I build and refurbish my own telescopes. AMA!,"Hi everyone! My name is Zane Landers and as you have probably seen on this sub and at the top of /r/all these past couple days, I make my own telescopes. By popular demand, I'm doing an AMA! I really didn't think I'd be here or doing this and would like to thank all of you from /r/space, /r/telescopes, /r/all, and other subreddits and websites where my post has been shared. I never could've dreamed of any of this!

[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/OT6Y219.jpg)

I've built a lot of telescopes, from my first - a [6"" f/4.3](https://i.imgur.com/MhLih97.jpg) with a mirror I made that's been in *Sky &amp; Telescope* and [TIME](https://time.com/longform/amateur-astronomers-stargazing-photos/), to janky [16](https://i.imgur.com/aKvwSi8.jpg) and [20.5](https://i.imgur.com/0hRLnCu.jpg)-inchers, [a pair of 6-inchers](https://i.imgur.com/zS3QvhH.jpg) for a STEM class I co-taught, my [10"" f/3.2 wide-field scope](https://i.imgur.com/bTZHcuM.jpg), prototype [10"" f/5.6](https://i.imgur.com/EcQah4N.jpg) and [12"" f/5](https://i.imgur.com/xBxEvo9.jpg) scopes, and now my [14.7"" f/2.89](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/frdd1d/im_17_years_old_and_just_finished_building_this/). I also wrote the stickies for /r/telescopes and /r/binoculars and most of the reviews and guides for [TelescopicWatch.com](https://telescopicwatch.com/). I've also owned and refurbished quite a few commercially-manufactured scopes, my favorite being my 1972 Celestron C8 [\(before](https://i.imgur.com/7a4r7kB.jpg)/[after](https://i.imgur.com/4fNoDe4.jpg)) which I got repainted with the help of a professional auto body shop and had to do a complete mechanical restoration of.

You can see more of my content and work on [cloudynights.com](https://www.cloudynights.com/), [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zdlanders/), and my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFMGSpnAnLlPoWeZ9Rf90BA/videos?view_as=subscriber), and support me by following me on the latter two and checking out my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/zdlanders?fan_landing=true). In the next few days, I'm going to be starting a telescope making tutorial based on the [Stellafane design](https://stellafane.org/tm/dob/index.html) for an easy 6"" f/8 that will meet or beat the abilities of a commercial 6-incher that can be made for just a few hundred dollars with the most basic skills and equipment, as well as continuing to post other tips and info on choosing, using, and building your own telescope(s).

EDIT: AMA is live, I am waiting for more questions! Will be keeping this up at least through 5PM-6PM EST.",85,1585670075,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fsfdvj/im_17_and_i_build_and_refurbish_my_own_telescopes/,space,34

&amp;#x200B;

I went outdoors for a smoke. Chilled and looked at sky.

&amp;#x200B;

Saw something very very very strange.....

&amp;#x200B;

At first i saw 3 flying objects (looks exactly like stars, shiny thingy) flying in weird formation.

First round went something like this : .  (two in a straight line and one off the line) after they traveled some distance the light of these objects goes blank, cant see them.

Second round a few seconds later - 1 star thingy stoped (arround the same place those 3 thingies stoped and went blank) and now just stands there.

&amp;#x200B;

Third round - one after another after another and after another, same distance between them and kinda fast speed. goes blank arround the same spot where those other thingies went blank.

&amp;#x200B;

frjj3y,Alkandros_,"Hypothetical: Great! We found a planet with signs of intelligent life a million light years away, now how do we communicate with them?","How would we ever communicate with a planet we think probably has intelligent life if said planet is even hundreds of light years away?

If my understanding of distance in space is correct (and please correct me if it’s not, I am certainly not an expert, I’m just curious) a lightyear is the distance in which it takes light one year to reach an object in space; so the light from a planet 100 light years away is essentially 100 years old. So if we transmitted a message which could travel the speed of light to a planet 100 light years away it would take 100 years to reach said planet.

On the cosmic scale 100 years isn’t even a drop in the ocean, but for living things (assuming extraterrestrial life is “life as we know it”) 100 years could be the difference between populated cities and radioactive wasteland. How would we ever even know if there was any intelligent life left to receive our message? Or even if the planet was still there at the time of sending?",22,1585539417,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/frjj3y/hypothetical_great_we_found_a_planet_with_signs/,space,1

Even as a kid i always wondered ""wHt if we shot a rocket from the north pole, like not at anything just into empty space? Does space have an 'up/north'?""

This is obviously rudimentary thinking. But the points i need help understanding are:

-Is space flat, and if so os this a fact (as close to it as scientifically possible) or one of many theories?

-if it is flat, is there a reason why? Not like, an omnipotent force 'why' but more of a "" if the big bang exploded all matter out from one point wouldn't it go in 360 degrees, why?""

-im familiar with the idea that if space were flat that things like black holes are giant dimples in space, pushing down on it? I guess? If thats true, is there anything actual or theorized that can...push...up on space?

The US Government is planning a $6 Trillion stimulus to reshore the economy. In such testing time, the first thing many politicians would be calling for in a cut in NASA's budget, which is understandable in the present circumstances

Which projects do you think will get cancelled? (Lunar Gateway, Europa Clipper, WFIRST, etc)

And among the project that do survive, how further will the timeline get pushed due to budget constraints? I worry that Artemis will be the biggest thing to get affected.

In my opinion, private industry would not be as badly affected as NASA. All the big players like SpaceX, Boeing, Northropp Grumman, etc will survive the recession.


But I guess even private industry projects like Starship will get pushed back by a year atleast.

fqo56u,andres_1,Are Acoustic Waves the Answer to Artificial Gravity?,"In various forms of science fiction, most space-faring ships are portrayed as possessing artificial gravity. Whether it be through gravity plating, rotation, or several other methods, very few hold any real merit. However, artificial gravity plating is an intriuging concept. Not as a genuine manipulation of gravity, but instead as a form of ceiling tile that applies a form of pressure to things below it.

This brought on the concept of utilizing directed acoustic bombardment as a viable method of artificially applying 1G of pressure. But how would such a system function? The idea revolves primarily around a plate speaker that resembles the United States Military's Directed Stick Radiator (DSR). An acoustic weapon that can deliver a focused, painful, and audible sound up to 100 meters away.

Utilizing this technology, can an array of speaker tiles be constructed to emit a powerful and low-frequency acoustic pressure wave—the result of which forces an individual towards a designated ground. To prevent the technology from intervening with human tasks and daily life, the speaker should use infrasonic sound with a high cycle per second rate. Infrasonic sound will remove a space-faring humans' ability to audibly detect the sound while a high cycle rate will hamper their ability to detect the sound kinetically.

Outside the typical benefits that will be gained from such a technology, it can also be turned on, off, or even adjusted depending on the requirements of a vessel. This will allow for storage rooms to have little to no artificial gravity, while human living spaces could have an entire G.

There are two possible methods to test to see if something like this is feasible. An experiment could try to increase the localized gravity in a room or decrease it. If a lab could increase a room's gravity to 2G's or reduce it to zero, it would be proof of its viability.

So what do you all think? Is it something we should pursue and experiment with?",5,1585415524,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fqo56u/are_acoustic_waves_the_answer_to_artificial/,space,1

fqg6w1,__KJG__,The shape of space itself (plus philosophy),"I was thinking about the shape of the universe and essentially concluded that it's unbounded hyperbolic space where the galaxies farther away, which are traveling away from the observer the fastest, will appear thinner as they disappear off the negative curve.  So, I think it's expanding into nothing. But with that model and shape in mind, eventually it's going to wrap around in on itself - causing galaxies to collide and form blackholes until one massive blackhole of pure infinite energy is formed which causes another big bang and the cycle repeats indefinitely.

Which is a very unusual model of how space could exist - because how does the space for nothing exist infinitely outside the negative curve even possible?. What is space stretching into? The model doesn't predict how large this could get - but either the space it expands into is infinite - or the the space is constrained enough to allow the eventual collapse and reemergence through a big bang. So those curves are going to continue to expand to where eventually they meet - but it won't meet and make a circle (the spherical model of spacetime). It leaves space empty. So it will be one big mess eventually and begin to cascade inwards.

Time is the dimension holding space together or at least giving it structure.  The plane moves as time moves. The negative curvature keeps expanding until it eventually wraps back around almost after eon and eon's - eventually collapsing in on itself and starting again. I now believe it's a closed universe (the construct), that isn't infinite in size - only possibility. But it follows a structure of events held together by the forces of nature.

So basically -  a flat Euclidean plane is a surface of constant zero curvature, and a hyperbolic plane is a surface of constant negative curvature. For this to work -  Anti-de Sitter space allows any number of space dimensions, it's infinite. In higher dimensions, it is best known for its role in the AdS/CFT, which suggests that it is possible to describe a force in quantum mechanics in a certain number of dimensions with a string theory where the strings exist in an anti-de Sitter space, with one additional dimension.  So, you can make a universe that essentially exists on multiple intersecting planes - that creates a multiverse. But the universe where in now is still just as real as the next - it continues on its trajectory towards implosion and shrinking - whilst other dimensional planes continue to exist in different dimensions. The math makes sense as well, string theory has come a huge way with the 10th dimensional model in explaining the possible transcendence of matter to higher planes of dimensional existence after wave collapse, with amazing clarity.

This explains why there seems to be extra sets of quantum material that have no purpose we know of - other than possibly branching off to higher dimensions to recreate the universe with different ensuring events. I think this is currently the leading theory.

Here a more scientific explanation for anyone wondering:

The constant time slices of this coordinate patch are hyperbolic spaces in the Poincaré half-space metric. The limit of the half-space metric is conformally equivalent to the Minkowski metric. Thus, the anti-de Sitter space contains a conformal Minkowski space at  infinity with infinity having y-coordinate zero in this area.

Inside AdS, space time is periodic, and the universal cover or plane has non-periodic time. Because the conformal infinity of AdS is time dimensional, specifying the initial data on a spacelike hypersurface would not determine the future evolution uniquely (*or* deterministically) unless there are boundry conditions that contain properties with the conformal infinity. 

So my general realization is that you can accept the multiverse whilst also accepting the  hyperbolic plane shape of the universe and space itself. They don't cancel each other out.

What's more interesting, is finding out if it truly is infinite or confined by the matter held within. I don't think it's infinite in mass, but the space (nothing) its expanding into is infinite is its expansion ability - but bounded by the finite mass and energy with the existing universe itself. So I think it's a closed loop constrained by the initial conditions of the big bang. The complexity is infinite but the space and size it can expand to is limited by the direction and shape it is expanding and forming. It will eventually stop expanding and collapse. The math seems to prove this will occur as well.",4,1585383816,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fqg6w1/the_shape_of_space_itself_plus_philosophy/,space,1

What resources are there that could help me, this is the perfect time now that I'm at home all the time. 

Any tips?

If you were coming closer and closer to our moon, for example, and you went under the surface, how deep would you have to go before sound could be transmitted through the solid material? 

Hypothetically, if there was a planet with no atmosphere and a liquid ocean, how deep would you have to put your head under the water to hear sounds, assuming the vacuum of space lies outside?

I cant find anything besides slime recipes or painting them on models. Just trivial projects that look cool and are fun. I'd really like for him to learn something new while also having fun. Any websites or ideas would be greatly appreciated!

If it helps, he is well above his learning level at school. Hes in kindergarten and can already read and do simple math. So, I'd guess that hes more at 2nd or 3rd grade level of comprehension.

fpvj1a,FairyTail0,Earth turning upside down,"Hi guys,

I have a question and the title already says in which direction it will go. So, I’ve been wondering if it’s possible for the earth to turn upside down? So basically the North Pole ends up where the South Pole is and vice versa. Obviously I don’t mean that it happens within a few seconds or days but instead if it’s just possible in general within a huge time span (for example by a 180 degree tilt of the magnetic field). 

Now on to the next question which follows the first one: let’s assume that it’s possible to turn the earth upside down and keep up its rotational direction and speed. Would it have any effect on us or would life carry on exactly as it is right now? I could imagine that maybe the poles would get affected but I’m not entirely sure and would have no explanation. 

I know the questions are a bit odd but it would be really interesting to know. Thanks!",19,1585309504,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fpvj1a/earth_turning_upside_down/,space,1

Could quantum computing (after many breakthroughs and maybe with the help of AI) in the next ten years help us in a way it makes possible for us to understand many concepts of physics that we do not right now? Like dark matter, wormholes, warp drivers, etc.? If we do have simulations thousands of times faster and more reliable, that would make everything faster (for example the starship production if it was available right now).

fpeuhr,atomic_houseboat,Do you think humans will walk on Mars in my lifetime?,"I'm in my late thirties, so assuming I live to my late seventies the question is: do you think humans will walk on Mars before 2060?

For as long as I can remember it seems like potential manned missions to Mars have always been roughly 20 years away, being either cancelled or pushed back at a rate greater than one year per year. Even any missions beyond LEO, which would be easier, seem to suffer the same fate (aside from Apollo almost 50 years ago). I know SpaceX claims they'll go to Mars in the mid 2020's, but that seems laughably optimistic, and I don't think anyone believes they will land anywhere close to that date. Not to mention that SpaceX's dates seem to get pushed back almost as often as NASA's.

I really, really want to experience the first humans going beyond Earth and walking on another world, but I get the feeling I shouldn't get my hopes up. I wonder if this is like fusion power: ""a manned mission to Mars is 20 years away, and always will be.""

fozuit,DontYellAtMe6969,Any others getting saddened the more we learn about space/the universe?,"I kinda wasn't busy with the cosmos at all for the last decade, I just knew uncle Elon is busy with Space X etc, then last week I followed a podcast with Jonnie Kim, the guy who was a navy seal, doctor &amp; now astronaut, I got interested in space, watched Interstellar a week ago, then I became obsessed with learning about the universe, very exciting, but then the sad started to come, nothing too major, cause i'm rather stable &amp; already worked through existential dread before, but:

I learned about the planet Kepler-452b being the world most similar to earth, I saw that it was 1402 light years away, I searched for speed of light, being  299 792 458 m / s , then I did the quick maths that even if we'd hypothetically could travel at the speed of light, no human would ever be able to reach it, according to Einstein's relativity theory that nothing can travel faster than light.

So this means, even if we colonize other planets, none will be like earth at all, on top of that, in 4 billion years earth will become inhabitable due to the sun becoming the big red one, but also in 7.8 million years, apparently there might be a 95% chance that humans will go instinct if we don't colonize other planets.

This knowledge, made me appreciate my life more, but also got me searching for hope for the future generations, i was wondering about the perspectives of you space people on a few topics:

How do you think humans could survive after the sun dies?

What are some things about the cosmos that could bring awe, without bitterness, besides knowing they fixed mars lander by telling it to hit itself with a shovel?

With the knowledge about our time here probably being small, how do you value building legacy in life?

How do atheistic cosmetologists keep their sanity?

### Why do this?

We do not often feel like we are in space.  
This will not be normal in the future. The awareness of the void will be strong in our daily lives. Large ships coming from the seas of the cosmic void, humanity living on many rocks, not just one. There will be posters advertising for trips to the moon, and mars. Space tourism adverts will enable our daily lives to be intruded with the awareness of the dark void in which envelopes us. This will be a great thing, altruism will flow and the idea of borders will diminish over time.

foty97,setiinstitute,We are scientists and engineers working on the Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) at SETI Institute. AUA!,"Answering questions today: 

Wael Farah: I am a holder of a bachelor's degree in physics and a master's degree in astrophysics, and I am currently finalizing my PhD thesis in astrophysics. I recently started a postdoctoral scholar position at the SETI Institute, to work on refurbishing the Allen Telescope Array. My main research focus is Fast Radio Bursts, extra-galactic bright milli-second wide flashes in the radio spectrum of unknown origin. Ask me anything!

Jack Hickish: I studied physics as an undergraduate at the University of Oxford, graduating in 2009. Initially, I stayed in Oxford to work on signal processing systems for multi-antenna radio telescopes as part of a PhD in astrophysics, before building a new digital backend for the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) telescopes as a post-doc at the University of Cambridge. I then spent 4 years in UC Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Lab, designing the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) digital processor, causing trouble in SETI meetings, and evangelizing about open-source signal processing hardware, software, and programming tools as part of the Collaboration of Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER). In 2020, I returned to my home country, and I now work as a freelancer in London, where I am responsible for making the Very Large Array talk Ethernet as part of the SETI Institute's ""COSMIC SETI"" project. Ask me anything!

Dr. Janusz S. Kulpa: I was born and raised in Poland. I finished my PhD in telecommunication at Warsaw University of Technology in Jan 2018. I spent 1.5 years at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (FL) as a postdoc and moved to CA to work for SETI Institute. My research interests include digital signal processing, MIMO systems, and programming. (Private interests include Argentinian tango, gaming, and books.) Ask me anything!

Alexander Pollak: I received my D.Phil in Astrophysics from the University of Oxford in 2018 after which I spent another year at Oxford commissioning the Goonhilly-3 radio telescope receiver system. In 2019, I joined the SETI Institute as Science and Engineering Operations Manager at the Allen Telescope Array to work on the feed refurbishment program. My research interests include analogue and digital signal processing, cryogenically cooled receiver systems, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Ask me anything!

Andrew Siemion: I hold the Bernard M. Oliver Chair for SETI at the SETI Institute and am also Director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center and Principal Investigator for the Breakthrough Listen Initiative. I and my team oversee a global research program seeking to determine the prevalence of technologically capable life in the universe, leveraging world-class telescopes operating across the electromagnetic spectrum, data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep partnerships with industry, private philanthropy and national funding agencies.

Because of WHO and CDC recommendations on social distancing, and now the lock-down for Tarrant County and Dallas County in Texas, the Fort Worth Astronomical Society has canceled our public star parties for at least the next few months.

Instead, we are going to start doing virtual star parties. Rather than have 100-250 people crowded together looking through telescopes, we will broadcast live a viewing through telescopes using dedicated astronomical cameras.

Ask questions, get answers, see stuff you might not have been able to see before. This is something new we are trying, so I expect to have teething problems, but we'll do the best we can.

Could this be what all this fuss and pandemonium is about? Are they planning to shoot it out of the sky alongside us, with possible nuclear or debris fallback?

fnt7jj,Ahlex_xx,How much would a cosmic telescope cost in these three scenarios?,"I've just watched the second episode of Cosmos: Possible Worlds and it talks about a cosmic telescope that would change completely how far and the level of detail that we can see our galaxy. I know there are a lot of issues that make it impossible today or at least prohibitively hard or expensive but you guys know better than I do so I'd like to propose 3 different scenarios and ask you guys how much it would cost.  


The only thing to bear in mind is: let's say it will be done by private companies, like spacex and not by government, which means they won't change budgets or the focus every time a new president comes in. And they will have only this in mind and not the many things NASA has for example. I know it's not gonna happen because it doesn't have the potential monetary benefits for private companies to do that but let's say they do (for any reason that doesn't matter here). And, of course, private companies can do the same job with a lot less money than governamental most of  the time)  


1- The first scenario is today. With our current technology. Do we have the technology to send big payloads (expendable Falcon Heavy for example) and assemble the pieces of a cosmic telescope (like we did with ISS for example)? let's say we have ""infinite money"". Would it be possible? How much would it cost? (billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions, trillions, etc.?)  


2- Let's imagine 5/6 years from now and everything went well with every company. Starship is working like Elon wants, we're building our moon base, Blue origin and all the other companies are working too. Maybe a couple of companies found a way to make it into the asteroid mining business (but still a long way to go), etc. Also, technology keeps improving as expected, quantum computing, AI, 3D printing, etc. Now we have bigger/better rockets with bigger payloads (and orbital refueling), 3D printers working in space, a moon base, etc. How much would it cost in this scenario? How doable?  


3- In this case, I wanna hear from you. What is the ""perfect scenario"" to make it possible? What technologies we'd have to develop to make it feasible, maybe costing less than 20 Billion for example? How far are we from having a cosmic telescope in your opinion?",3,1585001757,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fnt7jj/how_much_would_a_cosmic_telescope_cost_in_these/,space,1

fns4lw,SheCell,community for researchers dealing with shutdowns,"Hi all,

We started r/ScienceWorkers, a sub for science professionals, particularly focusing on changes to our life and careers during and after COVID-19 pandemic. It's a space to vent, share tips for lab shutdown, remote research-useful activities, and plans for post-pandemic life. 

Research professionals at all stages of career are welcomed: students, postdocs, PIs, administration, and independent researchers. Perspective from any place where you can do sciencing is appreciated, including academia, industry, non-profits, medical and all others. 

We are all affected by the COVID, with shut down of labs, shortages of reagents, cancellation of travel and other disturbances. It's likely the world recession will drastically change our funding environment, people might reconsider travel and teaching. 

It would be good to share tips for lab hibernation and recovery, tricks for keeping groups productive, and discuss plans for our training and research programs after the emergency is over.

""Below what atmospheric pressure does a human faint but can survive for a fairly long time?""

I've checked that it's harder to breathe at the top of Mount Everest 8848meters a.s.l. because pressure there is only about 0.30atm or around 303hPa, but people manage to survive there.
Also found out that we cannot survive below 0,06atm ~61,8hPa
Where is the border between surviving and fainting.
If you feel that this question is stupid, feel free to tell me about it. :)

Side note, don't read, waste of time:
Martian atmosphere is around 0,01atm, in the ""deepest place"" the pressure is ~ 11,55 hPa, so, even if martian atmosphere consisted of Oxygen, Nitrogen, and the rest of the elements in earth-like proportions(20,94%Oxy,78,08%Nitr,~1%rest) or the amount of Oxygen would be higher but all of that 100 times lesser than on earth, we wouldn't be able to survive there without a pressure suit.",0,1584980167,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fnmmoj/below_what_atmospheric_pressure_does_a_human/,space,1

[https://youtu.be/rQuZsmmHhGM](https://youtu.be/rQuZsmmHhGM)  
\* \* \*

It has been theorized by some that humans are the only intelligent lifeforms to exist in the universe. It's understandable how some would think that seeing as how we have yet to discover any intelligent lifeforms but personally I disagree with this theory simply due to how vast and infinite the universe is. We know so little about our universe and so i wouldn't seem too out of the question for intelligent life to exist out there somewhere in the cosmos. Surely we can't be alone in the universe. To me, it just seems unlikely that life could only exist here in the vast and infinite ocean of space. Throughout history science has proven itself wrong time and time again. It was once theorized that the **EARTH** was the center of our solar system until roughly over 420 years ago in the 16th century.",1,1584867649,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fmwywe/exploring_alien_civilizations_starting_to_wonder/,space,1

fmubg5,ruizk_311,Future Astronaut?,"What’s up guys and gals, to anyone who takes time out of their day to read this it’s much appreciated and any comments or questions are totally cool, I’d really love to hear it. I just needed to get this out there and maybe there are some of you that can relate or can help out.

I’m currently a senior in high school (M 18) and I plan on majoring in biomedical engineering in college. As a kid, I’ve always wanted to go to space (who doesn’t?) but over the last few years  it’s really become a serious thought. As an athlete, I have also developed a love for the human body in relation to how it functions and really the ability to do things that the body shouldn’t really be able to do which never ceases to amaze me. I used to think that maybe the dream of being an astronaut will always just be a dream so I thought I’d pursue a career as a physical therapist instead and that would be my life which doesn’t sound too bad.
 
However, I also imagined myself 20 years down the road, looking back and saying to myself, why didn’t I just go for it? What was there to lose?

After talking to my physics teacher who knows a relatively great amount about this stuff, he put me onto biomedical engineering. Best of both worlds where I could potentially end up as some type of mission specialist or design space suits or something of those works.

This ambition and these ideas are exciting but I know the reality is tough. It’s gonna take a lot of work and dedication and there’s the chance that I might fail. But every night I go outside and I can literally just sit there until my neck is sore because I’m so entranced by the stars and the mystery and the fact that if God made this vast universe why shouldn’t we go explore it and so what if we fail but best of all I feel like a little kid again and I forget all my worries because all this shit is so damn insignificant when you look at the big picture. So yeah I’m going to go for it because why the hell not?

I know that was long and there’s not really a specific question but if you’ve gotten this far I appreciate it. As I’ve said I’d love for any of your thoughts and personal experiences that you guys can share that could help me or enlighten even its just a little. I’ve got a long and uncertain journey ahead and I’m excited though nervous but fuck it I’m all for it.",7,1584852906,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fmubg5/future_astronaut/,space,1

fmnqe0,bot_bot_bot,"Saw six ""satellites"" moving west to east across the sky last night just before 21:00 (CET Europe)","I was out BBQing some burgers last night admiring the first crystal clear sky in a long long time. It was really pleasant.  
I was admiring Orion (as usual) and I noticed a satellite moving from West(ish) to east, fairly rapidly, a bit quicker than most. I remember a number of years ago being lucky enough to witness a soyuz (I think) capsule docking with ISS, this was moving about the same speed. I noticed shortly after another point of light the same brightness moving in the exact same vector, with the exact same brightness behind it, separated by a distance about the same as the two stars on the left side of Cassieopa in this [image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/CassiopeiaCC.jpg) in the night sky.     
I thought to myself, wow, that's pretty cool, but I knew it wasn't ISS. Then, to my complete amazement, after these two had passed Orion, another two appeared, on the same trajectory, but parallel to each other, instead of one after the other.  I couldn't believe it! I called my wife out to take a look. Again, after they had passed Orion, TWO MORE APPEARED!!! Again, moving along the same trajectory, but these two were separated diagonally.    
All six moved across the sky at exactly the same speed, in the same direction.   
Anybody got any idea what they might be??  I was thinking space junk, but they looked like exceptionally well organised space junk in that case. Maybe some of those SpaceX starlink satellites being launched or something ?? 
I've no idea. I'm located in Sweden.",1,1584827864,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fmnqe0/saw_six_satellites_moving_west_to_east_across_the/,space,1

Entrepreneur of the year from Ukraine builds NewSpace empire. Max Polyakov's Firefly Aerospace launches to the forefront of the market, thanks to business savvy and noosphere philosophy.

Firefly Aerospace shines as a launch date for Alpha rocket approaches. Space industry analysts say company' engineers set to carve out niche in new industry.

Investors want a piece of Firefly Aerospace as hedge for market rout. Flight from financial markets boosts prospects for privately-held company with offices in Ukraine and USA.

Signal that came out a few hours ago that I watched,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fjEEiXB4Bg) and it made me have some questions about what I've seen this sub post about the wow signal before.

I sort of forgot about the wow signal discussion until now, and I always thought that the general consensus (particularly on this sub) was that the signal was a result of comets that were in the area at the time, which was discovered by Antonio Paris in 2017, and that the whole alien thing was basically debunked. 

Though, this video mentioned something interesting that I hadn't heard about before. Apparently the Big Ear was the only telescope that could detect the signal. 

Has Antonio Paris rebutted this? I feel like this would totally denounce his idea, but it seems to be deemed as the official explanation, or am I just out of touch?

fm4l3e,raisbecka,NASA and SLS vs. Space X and Falcon Heavy and/or Star Ship,"Why doesn't NASA use vehicles manufactured by SpaceX - as opposed to developing their own SLS?  


I get that SpaceX hasn't yet put people in space (although they've already demonstrated their capsule to be superior to Boeing's), but from a business perspective I would imagine contracting out to a company with existing reusable rocket technology would come in FAR under the cost of building your own, SINGLE USE rocket. Also, on the safety side, it's not like the safety record of past space programs were incredible to begin with (relative to other industries).  


I work for a government, and I'm guessing a large factor for this is because this rocket was stuck in analysis paralysis and legal/approval hell for many, many years (or possible political/budget issues). We deal with similar problems, and it regularly leads to our new technology being way out of date by the time we can acquire it. It's actually a difficult problem to solve - there's just too much procedure and policy to be effective.  


Does anyone else feel that things could be handled better if NASA stuck to operations, planning, and research, and left assembly of the vehicles and tools to private industry (not just SpaceX)? Just because they've done it before, doesn't mean they need to (or should) keep doing it. I'm honestly curious what people think... I'd like to hear both sides of the argument. 

To be clear, I think NASA is incredible... I'm in no way shitting on them. I just think this way of operating and thinking could benefit from being reconsidered...",6,1584745025,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fm4l3e/nasa_and_sls_vs_space_x_and_falcon_heavy_andor/,space,1

fm1s3f,Dionysis_insapien,Could you fire a gun in space?,"I'm thinking here a modification to either your gun or possibly your bullets in order to provide oxygen for the ignition of the gun powder.

Could you either:

Create a type of bullet that contained a small pocket of oxygen inside it that would be pierced as the firing pin contacts the bullet giving it the neccessary oxygen to ignite? presumably only a small amount would do the trick that could be encased in a bullet.

Or have a gas canister feeding into the barrel with a mehanism that would flood the barrel with oxygen at the point of fire?

I feel like this should be feasible; given a fairly high pressure inside your gas cannister temporarily filling the barrel beating the escape to space for long enough to fire the bullet.

A canister flushing the barrel with oxygen would probably be more robust than relying on each individual bullet maintain it's own supply producing fewer failures from the gas escaping. The makeup of the bullet to contain oxygen aswell as being able to reliably fire may be too complex to be realistic.

Maybe a chemist would know whether it would even be possible for a solid compound with oxgyen content as such that it could be utilised at the point of fire removing the need for compressed gas at all.",32,1584734930,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fm1s3f/could_you_fire_a_gun_in_space/,space,1

But say you were the size of a pen, you would perceive the football field to be much larger.

So what if we are somehow getting infinitely smaller at a certain rate which is making it look like the universe is expanding but we are just getting smaller.

A moon wide ocean on its own is pretty amazing, when im not wondering about wether the ice on top swivels about on top of it I'm wondering about life.

The thing that worries me is the actual energy density available once you get that far from the sun. I think this hit home for me when reading something about solar panels, that the earth recieves thousands of times more energy every day than we would ever need. 

Thinking about life, particularly in the stages that it's just getting going it seems to me that having plenty of excess energy would be a massive plus. More kinetic energy in general, more chemical interactions to build up complex chemistry. Then more energy around to be converted for life to sustain itself on once arising in a precarious state would be very helpful.

Almost all of the life here traces its energy back to photsynthesis or something it ate photsynthesising, kilometres of ice pretty much kibosh that so thats a negative. Life surviving, and theories it originated by ocean vents is a plus. 

I feel somewhat though that after (so far) such dissapointment at mars, our prior best bet, that we may be holding out hope for life further and further out where the energy density may just be too low.",14,1584670175,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/flmquy/id_love_for_there_to_be_life_on_staurns_moons_but/,space,1

A couple of nights ago I set up a camera to do some shots for star trails in my back yard and after I stacked all the images together I saw this streak of light which I thought might be a shooting star so i had a look through my photos but didnt find it, what I did find was this light moving very slowly accross the sky before disappearing. Since I did 30second exposures and it was visible for 70ish images I calculated that it was visible for 35 minutes before disapeering. So Im wondering what this could be? Maybe an Asteroid? or a Comet? Definatly not a satellite since it didnt move that much in the 35 minutes it was visible. My Latitude is -35.277990 and My longitude is -35.277990, These images were taken from around 10am to 11am UTC on the 17th of March, Looking around North-West.

One day, while they were all hanging out, one of my great uncle's buddies jokingly said that Aldrin should drop acid while in space. Everyone laughed, but my great uncle said Buzz didn't, and just had this weird smile on his face. With all of this new information about Buzz Aldrin coming in, as well as one of his nicknames being Dr. Rendezvous, this just has to be the case. I would imagine it would have been quite simple, just putting it in his sock, and just not telling anyone. I agree, to the unstudied eye, this idea might be fair-fetched.

I know from what I've heard that it would be lesser than 30 years and that I could possibly find out the answer fairly easily if I knew how to ask the question properly but I cant seem to find an answer. I have a feeling that if someone was to travel for a year in their time at the speed of light that those who didn't would experience 10 years but idk if I'm pulling that out of my arse or not, so thank you to anyone that can answer me this question and possibly explain the maths so I can figure this stuff out for myself in future.",10,1584503172,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fkj5ql/space_travel_question/,space,1

•The ship is traveling at a velocity we could theoretically intercept with our current technology, should we want to

•The ship is traveling at a straight course or in a partially heliocentric orbit throughout our solar system with no apparent intent to hang around and investigate our planet, aside from passing in very close proximity to us. At its closest point of its passing, it would be within the distance between ourselves and our moon

•The ship is traveling at a velocity slow enough to allow us to detect and debate our course of action for a few weeks before it makes its pass

•The ship does not respond to our attempts to contact it remotely from earth via the more innocuous signals such as radio waves and gamma ray bursts

•The ship is approximately airplane-carrier sized

•The ship has no “apparent” armaments that we can detect from afar

fjnuod,X-37bNASA,Daily Space News: The Milky Way is in the shape of a chip/crisp,"The Milky Way is bent. It's shape curves at the edges. The galaxy is significantly warped.

“I’d say that it is shaped like a Pringle,” said Radek Poleski

For tens of years, and decades people though the galaxy was like a  flat pancake, but in reality, it is warped, more than astronomers thought.

The Milky Way is estimated to have a diameter of just over 100,000 light-years, and our solar system is about 25,000 light-years from the galaxy’s center. So it’s hard to see the bend from our point of view and vast clouds of interstellar gas and dust within the galaxy make it even harder to tell.

fiwupj,swp12225,Thoughts?,So i guess this could be semi religiously viewed. But what does everyone think of the idea that you join a universal energy when you die? So we know that energy comes in any form - if you die your body is broken down into energy to feed plants or whatever. But do you believe that your soul and thoughts have energy? My believe is that when we die those thoughts enter the universal energy (your ‘soul’’s broken down energy has to go somewhere right?) and later it turns into life once more? Im curious for thoughts here. If im factually incorrect about anything ive said then please let me know,7,1584251930,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fiwupj/thoughts/,space,1

fiwiu1,JacobDCRoss,What creates an extra-large lunar halo?,"Here's the setup. Sometime last week, well after dark, I saw the most unusual lunar halo. We live just outside Portland, OR, on the Washington side of the river. I posted in r/Portland, and other people saw it, too. My wife photographed it, but it did not show up on the pictures.

Here's how it looked: The effect was circular, with a total diameter of about 30 times the width of the moon. The ring itself had a thickness of twice the moon's width. The ring on the outer edge was a beautiful blue, while the space between the moon and the ring looked slightly lighter than the rest of the sky.

I have not been able to find any documentation about this phenomenon. Any images of lunar halos that I find are MUCH smaller than this was.

fiemt0,behuman4,Save our planet together.,"  

Recently I came across a wonderful speech by Сarl Sagan and something in my head turned upside down. I would like to share this video with you.

We live in the 21st century, but wars and disasters still occur on earth. A lot of strange and terrible things are happening in the world today and I would like people to not forget who we are and where we live. I would like people to become kinder and more patient with each other and not to show aggression, so that people can put themselves in the place of another person, and throw away all frames and prejudices. I hope that one day we will all live in peace.

People are distracted from real and pressing problems. Therefore, I want to give this maximum resonance, because today even an egg can collect millions of likes. Let's distribute this video everywhere so that as many people as possible realize that we are all human beings and we must all love each other. I hope for your help and your support. Thanks to all!

fie7sg,daddyyucky,CSA Intelligent Drone Light Shows,"The Caribbean Space Agency pursuit of an intelligent drone light imitating a Jumbotron broadcasting in the sky for advertising and hospitality industry purposes at large may be the best way to penetrate Indian tribes that have never made civilized human context anymore.  The obsolete Jumbotron st the now demolished Tampa stadium was 40 meters wide and 25 meters tall with a screen resolution of 240x192.  Along with extending the viewership of Sunday NFL football game replays, this broadcasting method presents some Orwellian ethical problems like simulating the vision of God of Moses on Mt. Sinai, a totalitarian takeover of the earth rescuing modern technology could obstruct the prospect of ever implementing a space or astronomy program by altering the sky view with drone lights to keep philosophers like Pythagoras and Plato from developing formal geometric logic.  The CSA is developing ways to communicate or advertise in the sky using organized drone lights to advance our hospitality industry through space age technology.  Commercial messaging and basic communication can be achieved thus far using this technique.  We are interested in intelligent light shows that can respond to input visually through an A.I. chatbot interface, effectively respond in real-time and intelligently.

I am soon to start high school and I am hoping to get advice in a career regarding space colonisation.

I’m wondering if anyone here could suggest a suitable job, or advise me about what I want to do. Currently I want to become a Aerospace Engineer that designs space stations and planetary settlements, is there a specific name for this type of job? Also I am wondering would I benefit from taking up a Aeronautical Engineering course in college, or is it not the same thing as Aerospace Engineering?

fi31yk,Whitefox_YT,"""By show of hands"", are you interested in Space Telescopes?","Hey guys, so I'm a really really small YouTuber (lawyer by trade), with an insatiable passion for space and science. Why am I a lawyer? Because I am clearly an unstoppable moron. That being said, it has opened up some very interesting avenues (Space Law), so not all bad.  


My last upload was towards Q4 last year, and I'm getting back into the swing of things this year with a mini-documentary on Next Gen Space Telescopes. I researched the science of Light itself, Telescope technology, and am planning on doing a video consisting of the following headlines:  
1. How telescopes work  
2. Hubble's Heritage  
3. Hubble's Tech (to set a baseline for what's possible given certain specs)  
4. WFIRST  
5. TESS

6. JWST

7. LUVOIR  


The idea is to give a proper, detailed spec rundown of each of the upcoming, truly next gen space telescopes and to draw some conclusions from that. Hubble was launched 30 years ago, and it has truly revolutionized the way astronomers do their work, and our understanding of the universe itself.   


I think that with the launch of these new telescopes, space will become our scientific playground in ways we can't yet begin to imagine. Advanced spectrometry enables us to peer into atmospheres of exoplanets like never before, next-gen deep infrared observatories will allow us to witness celestial bodies in a primordial state of time, back almost to the very beginning of time itself.   


So, what I wanted to ask the lovely community of r/space is: are telescopes boring? Or would you be interested at all in watching something like this?",41,1584119522,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fi31yk/by_show_of_hands_are_you_interested_in_space/,space,1

It is designed to give you the most bang for your buck and also make sure you won't get bored after the first 6 months or year. The truth is there are endless amounts of options regarding what you could purchase as your first telescope. Hopefully, this will for someone who just wants to get started point them in the correct direction.

I am uniquely interested in GIS/GPS marketing for civilian consumer activity, tourism, and quasi-military survival missions.  Marketing in space is now going to be possible and available to civilian surveillance use.  MMO game programming has tounched the surface of the earth, role-playing in proximity as a form of civilian reconnaissance.  The CSA (Caribbean Space Agency) has now opened its tourist and hospitality market to marketing on satellites, now inexpensively available through the international space market.  We have transportation routes, lodging, hospitality for tourists, and private apps through the tourism API featuring planes, trains, car rentals, public transportation, and ride sharing now that port of call logistics from orbit are cheaply extendable to civilian uses.

Hello, I'm Ben Feist (u/elconcho), creator of Apollo in Real time ([apolloinrealtime.org](http://apolloinrealtime.org/)), a website that plays back Apollo missions in their entirety, as they happened, using historical media and other mission material. You can view a short video about the response to my Apollo 11 project this past summer, here:[ https://apolloinrealtime.org/makingof](https://apolloinrealtime.org/makingof)

**This morning, myself and a small team of volunteers have just release the Apollo 13 mission at**[ **https://apolloinrealtime.org/13**](https://apolloinrealtime.org/13)

Included real-time elements:

* All mission control film footage
* All on-board television and film footage
* All Mission Control audio (7,200 hours)
* 144 hours of space-to-ground audio
* All onboard recorder audio
* Press conferences as they happened
* 600+ photographs
* Searchable transcript
* Post-mission commentary

The material we have brought together into this multimedia project includes mission control audio that was digitized for the first time specifically for us. They include 50 channels of flight controller activity for the entire mission. The last five of these tapes were only recently found in the National Archives and were just digitized at JSC this past February. They contain the period of the mission surrounding the on-board explosion that disabled the mission and haven’t been heard since the accident investigation in 1970.

Gitsinler.Oysa ben senin gözlerinsiz edemem bilirsinOysa Allah bilir bugün iyi uyanmıştıkSevgiyeydi ilk açılışı gözlerimizin sırf onaydıBir kuş konmuş parmaklarıma uzun uzun ötmüştüBir sevişmek gelmiş bir daha gitmemiştiYoktu dünlerde evvelsi günlerdeki yoksulluğumuzSanki hiç olmamıştı

## Oysa kalbim işte şuracıkta çarpıyorduŞurda senin gözlerindeki bakımsız mavi, güzel laflı İstanbullarŞurda da etin çoğalıyordu dokundukça lafların dünyalarınÖyle düzeltici öyle yerine getiriciydi sevmekKi Karakoy köprüsüne yağmur yağarkenBıraksalar gökyüzü kendini ikiye bölecektiÇünkü iki kişiydik

## Oysa bir bardak su yetiyordu saçlarını ıslatmayaBir dilim ekmeğin bir iki zeytinin başınaydı doymamızSeni bir kere öpsem ikinin hatırı kalıyorduİki kere öpeyim desem üçün boynu bükükYüzünün bitip vücudunun başladığı yerdeMemelerin vardı memelerin kahramandı sonraSonrası iyilik güzellik.

fh655x,dirnthelord,Is it possible to find habitable planets using its' radio signature?,"I read somewhere that some scientists were able to capture a radio signal from a aurora of a distant planet. Now that this certainly possible, here's something to think about. 

Every natural system on earth contributes in some way to the radio signals generated by earth. Before we embark on this journey, we need to figure out the radio signature of earth. Shouldn't be that hard given thousands of satellites hovering around us. Once we figure out how each system contributes to the signature we can start looking for similar ones in the deep space. 

Within our own solar system, we have a several other planets that aren't habitable with auroras and we already know what sort of planets they are and what systems are going in there. Grab the signatures of them too. 

Build a database of features and corresponding signatures. This is a classic pattern matching problem and a decent NN could give us the correlation between features and the signature (hash?)

Point the antennas to deep space and start capturing, and run them through a classifier. If we have done this correctly, the computer should be able to output with enough confidence weather it's a planet or not, weather it's habitable or not, what sort of natural systems are running in that planet and may be even there are life out there or not. 

A group of open minded computer scientists and astrophysicists should be able to figure out this solution easily.

fgyiss,_Dark,Are there any books that make learning about antimatter and/or dark matter approachable to a layman?,"Out of my interest in writing a sci-fi story, I've been reading articles about antimatter. What little I've learned about the matter asymmetry problem is fascinating - I'm intrigued by the idea that the existence of just one extra matter particle per every billion antimatter particles created during the Big Bang may be the only reason  *everything*  in the universe wasn't annihilated. 

I'd love to read more about really any of the  *mysteries*  of the lesser-understood things in our universe, whether that's antimatter, dark matter, dark energy, strange matter, or something else. I simply fear that I wouldn't be able to find a text that I'd stick with as opposed to finding too confusing or too much a slog to enjoy.

fgdey5,gorillaguts,Why don't we send legged robots to mars?,"I understand that rovers are basically mobile science labs, collecting samples and analyzing them using on-board instruments. Wouldn't it be more efficient to send hundreds of much lighter, more mobile (as in they have legs and can walk) sample-retrieving robots, and have them bring back their samples to a sort of base camp laboratory which has more, larger instruments than any rover can carry? If you don't have to move thousands of pounds everywhere you go, your robot can go a lot quicker, and thus collect more and diverse samples. If you have dozen Boston dynamics style robots running around and drilling out samples, and returning them to a base station with a laboratory and solar panels for recharging, then you could analyze a lot of samples. And, you could launch additional science equipment to the laboratory site piecemeal, instead of having to make a whole new rover if you want to do new types of analyses.

Why don't we do this? Is it just budget, or would this not work for some other reason? This would also add a layer of redundancy to every mission, since if one robot fails, or a piece of equipment fails, a new one could be sent to replace it while the mission continues. Plus, you could get economies of scale going by producing literally hundreds of these robots and base stations and peppering the entire surface with them, rather than designing a new rover every time you want to do a mission. You would get amazing, Google-maps style footage of the entire surface of mars, which will give you an even better idea of what landing sites are suitable for colonies and future missions to probe the Martian underground.

There's really no reason not to run these robotic exploration missions as modular, fire-and-forget type affairs where you just plaster the surface with hundreds of similarly built robots with robust autopilot programs and just let the science happen. Why do sample return when you could just launch a full lab suite to mars and give it tons of samples there?

I've heard the idea that robots with legs would have a hard time navigating on mars, but I've seen videos from Boston Dynamics and I'm pretty sure those things would do just fine.

fgbnzq,stevecrox0914,Why not terraform Venus?,"Venus is closer to our gravity and has a thick atmosphere it also sounds alot like our planet billions of years ago.

We have hyperthermophile's living around sulphuric vents and in deep cave systems which are designed to slive at 80+ degrees Celsius and there is the FerroPlasma family of bacteria designed to operate in sulphuric acid that eats iron.

Wikipedia lists Venus average temperature as 425 degrees Celsius, but I assume that is surface temperature and given the density of the atmosphere it's likely a single cell organism could float much higher up.

So it would seem terraforming of Venus would start by growing archaea in a lab (which can break down H2SO4, ideally consuming the sulphur) and gradually increasing the conditions in a lab to look like to upper atmosphere.

Then dumping cultures into the upper atmosphere. As the sulphuric acid levels drop the temperature should decrease and ideally if your releasing large quantities of hydrogen and oxygen we'd start seeing water.

I'm just curious why the focus is on terraforming Mars, when Venus seems like it would be a better long term option.

ffm0k6,tacotaker46,My Ideas for combating space debris,"Ok, space debris, big problem. We all know there is a lot of it in space orbiting around Earth, that over time could lead to the Kessler Syndrome. This is when space debris hits more space debris, which leads to more space debris until there is so much that we cant leave Earth's sphere of influence without being shredded. So I had two similar Ideas that I feel like might be some sort of solution towards this approaching problem. It would be nice to hear some of your guys' feedback or some of your own Ideas regarding space debris.

Essentially, both of these ideas include slowing down or dampening the speed of small debris by launching a device or object capable of doing so. An idea for one of them is some sort of giant lightweight sheet of some sort of material. When launching, this sheet is folded up as tight as possible to be able to fit in a rocket's fairing, then unfolded in space when in orbit. What this does is that when a piece of space debris smaller than 1-5 cm hits it, the object punctures through the sheet and absorbs enough of the energy to slow down its velocity. It hopefully absorbs enough velocity for the object to, overtime, graze the atmosphere enough to take it out of orbit. Now over time, this would cause the sheet to slow down enough for IT to fall out of orbit, so I'm thinking there is some sort of thrusters to speed it back up when necessary. Then when the sheet is too damaged to absorb anything else, or when it's low on fuel, or whatever reason for it no longer working, you can easily de-orbit it. Causing it to burn up in the atmosphere, leaving no debris itself. 

Now my other Ideas are similar to the first one, but instead of a sheet, it is some sort of large ""sponge."" This sponge absorbs and encapsulates the debris instead of slowing it down. There could be thrusters on it if you want to keep it in orbit, but I was thinking that you could save on fuel and weight if you just let it absorb until it slows down enough to de-orbit.

Both of these objects are meant to orbit in the opposite direction of the earth's rotation. I'm not sure if this makes the whole thing way too hard or expensive for these ideas to be launched, but that's what I was planning on.",18,1583713385,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ffm0k6/my_ideas_for_combating_space_debris/,space,1

fezpnb,Longlivethefighters,Observed a group of fast moving objects like satellites in yesterdays night sky. Could someone help me identify what I saw?,"Hello,
Just get right into here. I took a pee stop in the mountains in spain between Gijon and Leon. I was looking up and a clear night sky parked high up on a mountain highway.  I noticed what I would traditionally recognize as a satellite tracking into view. Here's the kicker: it was followed on the exact same trajectory by another equal object,  then another, then another,  then another... until there were 7 "" satellite "" object crossing my horizon from west to east. I found a reference point and calculated them to follow each other at about ten seconds gap from my view and they had spread the night sky totally I  under a minute ( though this wasn't without mountains taking up some of the sky).

Then... after about 20 seconds after the last one they were followed  by 2 more. Now, I grew up camping in Canada and really figured I knew a satellite  when I saw one  but this anomaly was completely  new to me. 

Did I witness some sort of new space company testing or technology... is this Musk?

fekknd,catnapspirit,Can someone help me understand what I saw last night?,"Last night, about 10 till 8pm Mountain time (I'm in Colorado), I glanced up at Venus, as it's been kind of high vis lately and thought it was moving.  Thinking, oh whoops, that must be a plane, not Venus, I looked harder and realized that it wasn't Venus that was moving, it was other lights nearby that were in motion, giving it the appearance it was moving in the opposite direction.  So maybe those were the planes.  Now that I had the frame of reference corrected, I saw it was actually four lights in a row moving, one trailing the other.  And these weren't planes, they were satellites, visible as the sun lit them from underneath (from my perspective), because eventually they each passed into the Earth's shadow and faded from view.

What the hell did I see?

These were probably in a 90 minute orbit, but flying west-to-east, not a molniya orientation.  And they were all lined up flying the same path, back-to-back, perfectly spaced out, one after the other.  I've seen solo satellites like that before, and I've worked weather satellites before so I have some idea about the field.  But what satellite constellation flies satellites in a line like that in LEO?

Nothing will mean anything because I will disappear. 

I have so many questions and almost none of them can truly be answered in my lifetime. So much I’ll never, ever, ever know. No matter how much I search. That scares me. That scares me a lot. I’ve never been so scared in my life. This isn’t something I can look at and understand why I should be scared. It’s the opposite.

If nothing exists, how did something come from nothing? The concept of nothing exists does not make sense.

But if something exists, where did the something come from? 

With question like this, we can keep tracing back to the root, but there wouldn't be a root. There will be a root of a root and so on. The fact that this world exist is amazing in the first place. 

Science wouldn't be able to explain all of this, nor will religion. People say science are facts and religion is faith, but is this really true? What are the facts based on? They are based on what we CAN observe with our current perception. But we are limited by the ways we observe this world. We see what HUMAN see, but how do we know if human sees EVERY element of this world. We can tell if something is tall or short, blue or green.

I am an EU citizen and so will be limited to companies and roles not following ITAR.

I am looking for advice on potential entry level routes into the space industry as most positions I have seen advertised online require 2-3 years of experience. It also seems most internship opportunities are limited to those currently studying a university degree, which I will not be after summer.

fdrofq,Albertchristopher,Time Dilation : How Time Behaves?,"Time dilation, as a mathematical concept, is tough to grasp. But thankfully, it can be explained in simple theoretical terms. Dilation, as you might know, is the process of becoming larger and/or wider. Thus, time dilation is basically the concept of widening the length of time itself! Oh yes, time can be stretched or compressed on a whim, and time travel is actually possible!

In fact, the Relativity theory shows that time slows down for a person in motion with respect to another person who is stationary. Thus, the husband from our previous example will experience fractionally reduced time the faster he travels in his car, showing he alters time more and more the faster he drives. However, I think I’m getting ahead of myself here! Let us try to understand the basic concept of time dilation first.

fdjcql,Just_surfing_along,4th dimensional travel," 

I'm trying to rationalize space travel via 4th dimension. If space is curved, you could conceivably move very quickly from one part of space to another along the 4th dimension where the curves come near each other. Think of having two points on a curved piece of paper where the 2D travel is along the surface, but 3D travel allows you to pop through to the other side where they touch.

This led to a couple of thought problems. First, let's imagine the 2D plane is occupied by capitalized letters, O, B, and R. When O passes through the 3rd dimension in negative Z and arrives on the other side, it is still an O. When B passes through, it is reflected, but it can simply rotate and still be identical. R cannot. When it passes through, it is now reflected and no amount of 2D rotation will correct it.

I'd like to know if there is similar symmetry in 3D such that some objects can pass through 4D fine (a sphere, for instance), but others might be reversed, or turned inside out.

Secondly, since the 2D character has no concept of the Z axis, how does it know how far to go before it hits the other side of the page and returns to its original plane? Aren't there an infinite number of other 2D planes between one side and the other? Wouldn't this same issue plague 4D travel for us?",15,1583354437,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fdjcql/4th_dimensional_travel/,space,1

What could the universe look like at if we could hypothetically zoom out further than the current observable universe? What if just how the universe began as a soup of subatomic particles, all the galaxies and stars are just a higher level of particles that together form something huge that isn't just the universe but something else. What if because of our inability to see all different forms of radiation at all different parts of the observable universe, we're missing something, something that would answer many of our questions. What *is* the universe as a whole? 

I get that this is getting at very theoretical topics that we don't know much of anything about, but I find it interesting to hear how these types of questions make one think and the ideas they come up with.

Feel free to ask any questions here, and if you’re interested and it makes sense, I’ll DM you.  I’m happy to pay a consulting fee, and thank you in the books liner notes.  I just want to get this right for the potential future space people of the world before I self publish it.

In relation to all of these discoveries; How do we know (or is there any way of knowing) that we are not observing the past relative to those planets/stars?  What I mean is that, given the vast distances invovled and the amount of time it takes for the information to reach us either in the form of observable light, infrared, X-rays or whatever other methods are used, is there any way for us to know that these stars/planets still exist?  

Let's say that something is 1000 light years away and we observe it today (today for us).  My understanding is that we are observing what happened in the past in terms of the time it takes for the information to travel 1000 light years and reach us.  Is that correct?

I've seen this idea referenced in a couple of computer games and tv series, Mass Effect: Andromeda and the new version of Lost In Space come to mind, where humans observe a planet(s) in the so called Goldilocks Zone and, for whatever reason (Earth is dying, asteroid going to destroy us, whatever) we set out to colonize this planet and thus ensure the survival of the human race however, when the people reach these distant planets, things have changed drastically and the planets are extremely hostile and almost uninhabitable.",20,1583344453,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fdgsvr/are_we_observing_dead_starsplanets/,space,1

fd7m42,reddragon12347,Is the speed of light slowing down over time?,"“The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you” Neil deGrasse Tyson

I always liked this quote. It helped me reconcile that I could not understand the mathematical gymnastics involved with dark matter, dark energy, string theory or the sudden unexplained expansion at the beginning of the universe.

However, I recently stumbled across the ""GM=tc\^3"" theory by Louise Riofrio that seems way to simple to be true. Does this simple equation really reconcile these anomalies and remove the need for a huge amount of dark “stuff” just to make the math work out.?

As dark matter and dark energy have yet to be found despite years of searching, it may be possible we made a fundamental error in assuming the speed of light has always been the same.

Phobos I sadly was shut down due to an incorrect command sent by ground control. Phobos II went down not soon after releasing some extremely... interesting images/data.

If anyone hasn't seen it yet [This image](https://imgur.com/a/nhOzXQM) was shown off by extremely decorated USSR cosmonaut Marina Popovich, who claimed that said image was being held secret by the Russian Government. It was later revealed that many world governments,such as the UK and US knew about these images but also kept quiet.

[n the image there seems to be a massive 20-kilometer long object in between Phobos 'II' and Phobos](http://imgur.com/a/fXeTHe6) seemingly approaching the probe. If this image wasn't shocking enough, or you feel like attributing this to a malfunction of the cameras then these other images might change your mind.

Both [this](http://imgur.com/a/xZGT97V) image and [this](http://imgur.com/a/KG7eXLf) image were also released by the probes. The first being a shot of the mini-moon's surface, and what seems to be a massive shadow looming over it. That's not from Phobos II, this is confirmed. The second image is a thermal picture showing some very rectangular formations underneath the surface. There's also the [Phobos Monolith](http://imgur.com/a/lQNpYnG), which unlike the Mars monolith is actually shrouded in mystery as to what it actually is.

I wanted to write a paper for my school project and needed some news articles to site referencing these events, and I couldn't find a single one.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/alihczgjhfk41.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=407303101f3e0fbdecd26b3a585307de5c1dfff4)

Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin, the first human to explore space took beef and liver paste from a tube, followed by chocolate sauce as dessert in 1961.

Use of food in space expeditions has been a question among all. The generation, that aspires to be astronauts at the beginning of Space Age, would have considered it a daydream after knowing what astronauts actually used to eat during their stay in space. However, astronaut’s foods have improved over recent years whereas a monotonous menu still appears to be a challenge for long-term spaceflight.

After returning to earth, Christina Coch, a female astronaut from NASA, who has spent the longest time in space, got desperate for salsa and chips as she told The Associated Press. According to her, you cannot have crunchy foods on space-suites as those may be hazardous to equipment. 

In 1961, Gagarin’s food was crumb-free and had two-portioned pureed meat preserved carefully in tube-like containers while John Glenn used to have applesauce and sugar tablets, dissolvable in water during his space visit in the following year. Glenn’s meal also featured pureed vegetables and beef in tube which has now been preserved in the National Air and Space Museum. 

During the first era of space expedition, space foods looked more like toothpaste. Throughout the Mercury program, NASA astronauts were allowed to take sucking foods put in tubes whereas freeze-dried bite-sized cubes and powders were available as another option. NASA’s Gemini program allowed astronauts to have solid-ish food and instead of toothpaste-like food, freeze-dried cubes covered in gelatin were served to stop crumbs. Then NASA took an advanced step by putting freeze-dried foods in plastic containers for the convenience of astronauts to carry something palatable such as veggies, chicken or shrimp cocktail.

By NASA’s Apollo mission, things were improved to another level after engineers had brought new developments like “spoon bowl” and hot water. Hot water was convenient for easily reconstituting freeze-dried food whereas spoon bowls made out of plastic bag required to be unzipped for eating food with a spoon. This attempt aimed to create an earthly experience. Freeze-dried foods were commonly used as reducing enough water from food would prevent bacteria from growing and this has also been a popular way of offering food to astronauts during their space expeditions. International Space Station has come up with 200 different items on its menu for astronauts and most of them have been made rehydrated. NASA has also taken an initiative to serve astronauts with warm sandwiches at launch for eating them in orbit. As astronauts spend many months in space at a time, a variety of food is tried to be offered to them to keep away the monotony of taking the same food week after week. As shaking pepper and salt for having them with food is prone to create an airborne hazardous situation, foods are served in liquid form. 

Space stations keep on experimenting to cater to the taste buds of astronauts during their stay in space so that they do not feel it monotonous to have liquidized food for a long time.

What comes to mind immediately is, what kind of downsides of this are there? For example, repair sounds like it would be a daunting task. But more unknown to me, will there be problems involving charged particles in our magnetic field out there? Or perhaps more radiation and debris hitting the telescope if it's well outside of our magnetic field?

fciyu7,nadirprice,"Astrophobia, I wonder why we fear outer space?","Did you know many people are terrified by the enormity of outer space? I guess for some it’s daunting to think we are floating on a spec of dust called Earth. I think this infinite vastness nullifies the self important ideas we may have of viewing ourselves as being at the center of the universe. I think it hurts our egos to consider the possibility that we may not be the only ones out here. These heavenly systems could care less about our microcosmic ideas, after all we are babies taking our first steps in cosmic time. Our time here is in the hundred thousands, while the vastness of the universe has been expanding for over 13 billion years (from our human estimates at least). Then I am left asking what the heck does one billion years look like, what about the time before time? Does time cease to exist then? 

I find it extremely fascinating that we belong to this universe, but more fascinating is that we came out of it. 

This galaxy, the sun, this planet and its entire biosphere. Knowing this makes me hopeful of all the possibilities, because I have a deep feeling outer space is our destiny. At the same time, I feel bad to see how we treat each other and the planet. 

However, it’s confusing to think of the state of affairs of the human race. We’ve been treating each other and the planet this way, from way way back, before Roman times. I don’t know, perhaps it’s our nature (I’m no behavioral scientist lol). As bad as it sounds, perhaps all the pillage and suffering has brought us to this place in time right know.

What if time is linked with the universe expanding?           I mean if you think about it if the whole universe didnt have any size. Lets say it was 0 cm tall and 0cm wide then would time even be a thing?
And if time was a thing would it work the same way? 

The question thats been bothering me is:
Is time something that happens because the universe exists or is it something that ALWAYS happens even when nothing exists. 
Basicly: Does time need *space* to exist?

fbw4kl,jaymauch,Relative light speed,"My mind is not one of those which has been programmed to fall in and march to the drum cadence beaten by those who profess to know everything because they march to that standardized beat instilled into them. So please excuse my non standard thought process.
 
All my life I have been reading the theories about stars, the speed of light, gravitation, etc. About how light from a distant star bends when it passes a large object with a gravitational field, and the fact that gravitation does this due to the quanta of light.
 
Where I have been getting confused lately is this. When Ole Römer used IO to figure out the speed of light, and was corrected by the updated diameter of Earth, his speed of light was determined by light from our star. When I read about black holes, they say the gravity of a black hole is so strong that light cannot escape it. From this, I surmise that this is gravity pulling on the quanta part of light. If this is correct, then it should follow that denser stars should have stronger gravitation than less dense stars, which leads me to believe that light, like a projectile, must have an escape velocity capable of overcoming it’s source’s gravity. If light has a pure speed in a vacuum, and all light’s pure speed is the same number, then all light should begin it’s journey at this pure speed number. It follows then that the pure speed number minus the gravitation strength number pulling it back, (as long as the remaining inertia of the quanta is enough to escape the gravity), would be the effective speed of that ray of light, continually decreasing until it completely escapes the gravitational field of it’s source. If this holds true, then the light from a dense star would travel through space slower than the light from a less dense star, or in the case of a black hole, where the net speed of light would be negative. If Einstein meant that everything in the universe is relative to everything else, then the speed of light must be relative to the gravitational force of it’s source.
 
When I think out loud in close proximity to the think police, they always spew the same standardized laws at me, that say “You cannot exceed the speed of light!”. My thought at that point is “And you cannot think for yourself”.
 
Yes, I believe that if you approach the speed of light, you will become one with the light. Unless there is no gravity which you, and your source of light need to achieve escape velocity from. Absent any major source of gravity, as in inter galactic space, what would keep you from approaching the speed of light? That is, the speed of light relative to gravity other than that of your space ship’s own gravity field, which would be traveling at that same speed.

Common hazards could be addressed through a genetic screening process like soldiers to tolerate pain, energy scarcity, and the physiology of humanity.  Accomplishments in technology have made the paradigm of organic computing a reality.  The field has already developed a biological mechanism to detect sugar fluctuations in the cardiovascular system through bacterial computers.  Enhancements and long-term goals in organic computing could include cognitive implants intended to introduce a logical circuit in the frontal cortex of the brain that could “install” literacy instead of the tedious piecemeal process of higher education, capable of bestowing photographic memory and eidetic memory to developmentally disabled individuals.  Also, the Corona virus scare suggests biological proxy viruses could be collectively selective and sentient, ordains their hosts like parasites and directing their behavior.

 (Re-upload. Editing previous version went wrong somehow)  
Back in 2001 I had a cheap, simple 130/900 mm Newton telescope and a simple digital camera. Living in the middle of the city, only lightstrong objects were really good. Had the telescope for a few years and then sold it.But the moon was (of course) always favorite. I had a camera mount and with the camera I did zoom in, using a 9mm ocular, on all separate parts of the moon. All those parts I stitched together and then I had nice pics.And then I learned that the moon actually has colors! Cool! Of course had to play with that :)

The result was this 4000 pixel shot. It is a mosaic of 56 separate images stitched together.It was featured here in the Netherlands at some astro sites back in 2011, especially because I did all of this with simple, cheap equipment. No tracking or whatever. Even my PC was low spec at the time.

So, I thought I share it here as a reminder that even with low spec equipment, nice things can be done. And a reminder to myself that it is time to get a telescope again ;)

 Hi guys, I've just finished Matthew Brzezinski's book, Red Moon Rising, about the start of the space race. It covered Korelev and Von Braun's ambition to use military missiles to launch satellites and the Russian and American politics behind the projects. I really enjoyed the style of writing and I'd like to learn more about what happens next. I think it's a shame Brzezinski never wrote a follow up.

I'm looking for a book or books about what happen after Sputnik I and II and ABMA's Explorer satellite are launched into orbit.

I'd love to know about Belka and Strelka, the first manned satellites, the formation of NASA, and the race to the moon.

Thanks guys!",2,1582933536,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/fb3sv8/can_you_recommend_me_a_book/,space,1

fasz2i,generalheed,Do we currently have any actual planetary defenses?,"It's a common scifi cliché in a lot of movies and shows for Earth to launch a bunch of ICBM's and other nuclear weapons as our main line of defense against incoming asteroids or alien motherships. But I heard that in reality ICBM's actually can't even reach geosynchronous orbit nor were they even designed to be used for attacking targets in orbit or beyond. Despite their theoretical max range, ICBM's were really mainly designed and optimized for striking other targets on Earth, not in orbit or beyond. 

So aside from hastily modifying our ICBMs for an LEO strike, do we currently have any other kind of planetary defense? If tomorrow a fast approaching asteroid was detected to hit Earth in a matter of days, is there anything we can do about it?

fac638,MGCMorph,"Where are all the Alien ""probes"" or Robot armies? Discussion.","I know it is in a huge part hypothetical but based on the Drake equation, there should be a lot of other life out there that is able to communicate. 

It's another assumption that they would use robotics, but is not without good reasoning. 

So with that in mind, why are we not being visited by robotic probes, or fleets of AI machines?

I've always wondered why this is, and the only 2 logical answers I can think of are a) the classic ""space is just too vast"" or b) we're the first to reach this stage. 

Well imho, b) is flat out hubris imho. a) has potential, but when I consider that the Voyager space probe is where it is, it would only take a civilisation like ours to be 1000years ahead of us, an absolute nothing in the grand cosmic clock, and they should have sent a massive amount of probes out into space possibly with FTL technology. Not actual FTL obviously but things like artifical wormholes, space folding/warping etc. Our own technology is creeping towards fusion power and when we have it, we will have the energy needs for all sorts of bizarre propulsion systems. 

So forget the actual biological aliens...  where are their probes?

f971hh,devi83,Gravitational-lensing lets us view the same celestial bodies during different phases of their lifespans in multiple places in our skies.,"Here is an example of what I mean: [Gravitational-lensing visualized](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/apm08279/apm08279_grav_lens_300dpi.jpg)

Now what that image doesn't tell you very well is that the distance traveled between Quasar Image A and Quasar Image B are different lengths which also means a different amount of time, so therefor in the example Quasar Image A and Quasar Image B will appear to be different ages to the observer on the other side of the galaxy. This must happen with normal stars too from behind sufficiently large enough gravity wells such as black holes or super-massive stars. I would say most stars in our skies have at least two or more images in the sky that appear at different places in the sky, which are just the same star during different periods of it's lifespan. As I look at the stars in the skies, I notice the pattern of what I have describe, and it seems to be frequent.

A great example of this is in the collision of two galaxies: [Antennae Galaxies](https://www.vol.at/2015/04/45a167f1ba424fe4bc2b08a3cd6941c2-45a167f1ba424fe4bc2b08a3cd6941c2-0.jpg)

How many of the same two galaxies can you spot in the image? It appears to me that the smaller galaxy pairs in the fringes of the image are the same large galaxies in the middle colliding (before they have collided).",7,1582618159,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f971hh/gravitationallensing_lets_us_view_the_same/,space,1

As a racial and gender minority in STEM myself, her story - her struggles and her triumphs - really resonated with me. Having role models like her is sometimes the only thing that gets me through a difficult day.

And yet, I can't say that I feel sad that she's passed. We're all only here for a short time, and the best we can do is make the most of it. And what a life she had - contributing to space exploration and human knowledge; she was a person who really lived her life. I hope, at the end of it all, to be so lucky.

f95f2t,ry4444,What if Dark Energy is/are multi-dimensional universes of their own?," 

Theory time:

According to modern science, the universe will continue to expand more and more rapidly until every thing that consists of matter dies off (even black holes). The source of this expansion is believed to be dark energy. Stay with me here.

68% of all energy in existence is believed to be dark energy. Towards the end of the universes' existence all energy will be dark energy. It is believed to be the ""cosmological constant"". It is also believed to expand over time. What if.

Each of these ""dark energy"" existences are actually different universes expanding. On different scales, and these scales actually represent dimensional existences. Much like our eyes can't see past certain distances, the life forms existing within these dark energies can't see beyond their dark energy ""border"". Also to note, the older something is the farther from the center of the universe it is. Which means that the life on the furthest reaches is more than likely dead.

tldr: What if dark energies were multi-dimensional universes that held within inhabitants of their own. (Life forms).

idk just a thought.

Also to note, I don't really know much about space. I just watched a documentary and it had me thinking about this. What do you guys think?",5,1582608886,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f95f2t/what_if_dark_energy_isare_multidimensional/,space,1

f8xg4r,MacGrubR,Marsquakes could be caused by global cooling and contraction (BBC article),"So I just read this article:   [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51616830](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51616830) 

&amp;#x200B;

From there I found it fascinating they found marsquakes.  I was under the impression you needed a molten core for that, and Mars' core cooled a long time ago.  What really stood out to me was this line:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Instead, much of the quake behaviour on the Red Planet is likely the result of cooling and contraction. As Mars loses heat, it shrinks and its brittle outer skin then fractures in response. 

&amp;#x200B;

This made me think of the expanding earth theory I learned about a while ago.   Most notably that it was debunked and widely contradicted.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanding\_Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanding_Earth) 

&amp;#x200B;

But that lead me to geophysical global cooling, which also appears to be debunked as well.  Though that seems to be what the BBC is hinting at in that article.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical\_global\_cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical_global_cooling) 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible the marsquakes are caused by cooling?  If so, why is that listed as debunked in regards to the Earth?  I suppose it makes sense from a very basic point of view (things expand when they're hot, and they contract when they're cold).  But looking at the model on wikipedia's expanding earth model it's clear it wouldn't expand THAT much unless you were pumping tons of heat into the core.  

Conversely, I'd expect some shrinkage up to the point where the core is completely solid and no longer cooling.  But global cooling is considered disproven and obsolete unless you're talking about the moon or Venus (global cooling wiki).

And had we found something substantial, how would we have gone about mining it? How would we go about sending it back in an economically viable way? Would that even been possible?

Im sure we would have figured something out, but what about Russia? Would they have put all of their resources into a lunar program and immediately started gearing up to go to the moon as well?

f8sinz,azarrazor,"Saw a weird ""star?"" today, and I need help identifying it","Hey guys, so I stay in India and attend a boarding school, and after dinner I noticed a very bright shining object in the sky, looks roughly the same size as a normal star in the evening but slightly bigger. It was around 8 o'clock, and this star is perplexing to me. I'm not the biggest science buff but have been very interested in astronomy and such sciences for the longest time.

Anyway, this star would blink, which is natural, but it would also continuously dim to the point where you can no longer see it around every 2 minutes, where there is an interval of 1 minute-ish where you can't see it, and then it's visible again. At first I assumed it was light pollution and clouds interfering with the starlight, where the clouds would gradually cover the star until it fades and you can see the star again. But this isn't the case, because I could clearly see the star slowly dim and not get covered, and my eyesight is very good for the record.

If it means anything, my house parent has been observing this same ""star"" for the past two months. It also kinda looks like a cross or an arrow, but that's probably just me overthinking it. It's hue is also a bright yellow.

Please help me figure out what's going on here!!!

f8jw48,mauionabreakaway,"Question about the fuel cell power generation on Apollo spacecraft, specifically how it's regulated.","I was reading about the fuel cells on the Apollo spacecraft a few weeks ago, specifically the emergency fuel cell shutdown done on Apollo 13 to try and save the leaking oxygen. I had read that the valves require careful calibration on the ground, and when closed in flight were not able to re-opened for that reason. This leads me to wonder, what regulates the fuel cell power flow / fuel consumption? Presumably the CSM stack didn't draw a fixed amount of power, so there must have been some way to control that.

I have a few theories:

1) There was some mechanism I'm unaware of for throttling the power production / fuel consumption of the cells, but I'm suspicious of this because it seems like it would be affected by the same careful calibration need.

2) The batteries could catch overflow and there was some procedure for burning off excess generated power. Given that this seems the least efficient and could contribute to already tricky thermal situation, I doubt this.

3) The chemistry the of the fuel cells provided a natural slowing of the reaction if reduced power flow caused a build up of voltage across the output. This seems most reasonable, but I don't have a good enough grasp on the chemistry at hand to confirm it

f7wnjb,The-Yeet-God-Yeetus,"I am making a speech for a contest for school, I already won the school contest and now I'm going to the district in the 28th. the speech can be anything to do with the future and I need to polish this speech for the contest and I need help because I'm not sure if it's good or not.","This is the speech, please don't be mean i'm only in 6th grade.

I want you to close your eyes and envision the future. What do you see? Do you see yourself going into the great unknown we call outer space even though you’re not an astronaut? Because I do, and for that we’d need commercialized space travel. Just think about it, moms in space, kids in space, the creepy neighbor from next door in space... I mean shows such as star trek and the original lost in space have shown us many examples of commercialized space travel there for spilling the gasoline and throwing in the match and starting a fire inside of me that really really wants commercialized space travel.  

In 1961, Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin was sent into space during both the cold war and the space race. Soon after, Neal Armstrong set foot on the moon in 1969. Take into consideration that the space race started in around 1955. It took the Soviet Union 4 years to figure out how to send a man into space, it took the U.S 14 years to figure out how to send a man to the moon, it’s kind of scary how fast they are figuring out this stuff. 

Now, with technology evolving at such speeds, our dreams of boldly going where no one has gone before might just become a reality. Of course, we still have long ways to go, we would need to develop a type of fast propulsion system to make the ride short and smooth. Something a warp drive or a form of hyperspace travel like the one that you’ve seen in Star Wars. Then we would need to make a starship big enough and strong enough to accommodate families and still be able to break through the earth’s atmosphere with ease and without burning up upon re-entry for maximum comfort. 

Although commercializing space travel may be years away from becoming a reality corporations such as NASA are already working on a way to open space travel to the public. NASA plans to open the International Space Station (ISS for short) to tourists, of course, it will not be cheap, but it is a step closer to open space travel to the public. According to BBC.com “Nasa is to allow tourists to visit the International Space Station from 2020, priced at $35,000 (£27,500) per night. The US space agency said it would open the orbiting station to tourism and other business ventures” 

I think it is safe to say that I am looking forward to the future, Imagine the possibilities. Assuming there is life beyond our earth, with space travel we could explore that new life. Space travel could introduce us to new cultures. If we choose to mine minerals from other planets, commercialized space travel would make it easier to bring to and from the mining grounds. 

Case in point space travel that is open to the public is one of the many things that people are looking forward to having in the future and as Neil Armstrong once said “One small step for man. One giant leap for mankind”",10,1582396647,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f7wnjb/i_am_making_a_speech_for_a_contest_for_school_i/,space,1

f7sf9l,GGKGR,"I have found the answers to space, matter, energy, gravity, charge, big bang, black holes, time dilation, speed of light and much much more","Hi, I am the writer of the book ""What if?"". In this book I have tried to answer a lot of questions related to God, soul, heaven, hell and the Universe. Here are some answers related to space and the Universe. 

Question 30 : What is Space?
I think Space is a superfluid medium that permeates throughout the entire universe and is responsible for the creation of every matter that we now see and also the waves being formed in this medium are called energy. There is also an existing theory that claims that space is a superfluid medium. And I think it’s absolutely right, but it’s still not complete and so I am going to present my own version of this. I think that there are two possibilities related to this universal space medium. Either it is made up of fundamental particles that are round and similar to each other in every way and have a force of attraction amongst each other. Or this medium is made up of two different fundamental particles – one big in size and the other small, that are both round in shape and have a force of attraction or repulsion between them. And the big particles are suspended in the sea of the small particles. Personally I think that it is made up of similar fundamental particles that have a force of attraction between each other, but there is some scientific evidence that points towards the existence of two different fundamental space particles that can have a force of attraction or repulsion amongst each other. Scientists believe that there are two types of energy fields that permeates throughout the entire universe. Electromagnetic field is responsible for electromagnetic energy and Higgs Field is responsible for giving particles their mass. Maybe these fields are just made up of these two particles, that form the space medium. And I also believe that these particles have lots of gap between them and so due to this attraction or repulsion and also gap between these particles, it is possible to stretch and compress this medium much more than any other medium like for example water. Also when waves are formed in this medium they can travel a lot farther and faster, as this is a very superfluid medium and therefore has very little resistance of its own, as I think these particles have a very weak force of attraction or repulsion and there is gap between them. But since these fundamental particles have mass and also force of attraction or repulsion between them, therefore there is a limit to how much this medium can be stretched or compressed. And I believe that these properties of these particles and this medium are responsible for everything that we see or observe in our universe.

Question 31 : What is light or energy or electromagnetic energy or electromagnetic radiation?
As you can see for yourself light, heat, radiation, electromagnetic energy etc. are the same thing. Crazy isn’t it. The light coming from the sun is the same electromagnetic energy or radiation that is coming from a bulb or fire or even a radio signal that is coming from a radio tower. I think this is because all these different forms of the same energy are just waves in the superfluid medium that permeates throughout the entire universe. And these waves are formed due to the movement or collisions of particles in the space medium. So if anything moves or collides with another in this medium, waves are formed, which are known as energy. These waves behaves just like the waves of water or air. So just like strong waves of water or air, the strong waves of space medium can also cause a lot of destruction, just like energy coming out of a nuclear bomb. So in a way these waves or energy are weaker or stronger based on the sources that are creating them. So energy from a light bulb is not harmful but energy coming out of a nuclear bomb is. I think this is because space medium can be compressed and when the waves are being formed from such a highly compressed space medium like the core of a star or planet, these waves become shorter and more powerful. We will talk about this more in later questions.

Question 32 : What is matter and how is it made?
As we have discussed earlier that I think that energy is just waves travelling in the superfluid space medium. But when two or more of these powerful waves collide with each other, they create standing waves in this medium. This is called matter. And due to the collision between the waves, these newly formed particles start spinning, in the direction of the most powerful wave, creating a vortex in the superfluid space medium. Due to this vortex a lot of particles of the medium are sucked closer to this particle, making it dense. This is called mass of the particles. These particles are called quarks, electrons, positrons etc. And before someone says that you can’t create matter from energy. Here is an article where scientists have found a way to create matter from light, which is just waves of the space medium. Scientists discovered how to create matter from light. So I believe that every matter you see in our universe was formed when very powerful waves were formed in the space medium by the Big bang explosion that happened in a supermassive black hole and these waves interacted with the vortex force that was still attracting the space medium towards this black hole and matter was created. So in a way the energy of these powerful waves got trapped in these matter particles known as quarks and electrons. And so this is why it is very difficult to separate the quarks and also so much energy is released when we try to convert matter into energy. And also maybe this is the reason why quarks come in pairs as they are formed by different waves of space medium and also scientists now believe that maybe even electron is not a fundamental particle and is made up of small particles, just like the pairs of quarks. Here is an article about it. Electron breaks into smaller particles. Also due to the spinning and the resulting vortex in the space medium, everything that is close to this spinning particles starts to flow towards this vortex and a powerful attraction force is created which is called strong nuclear force. This is the reason why quarks and protons and neutrons are so strongly linked to each other.  

Question 33 : What is charge?
I think due to the standing wave type nature of particles they creates waves in the superfluid medium by their movement. And depending on the corresponding movement of the space medium particles in time, two particles can make waves that have crests and troughs meeting each other at the same time or not. So particles that have the same charge are those that are making waves which are meeting Crest to Crest and trough to trough resulting in the waves becoming strong and then pushing each other away. So similar charges repel each other. And the opposite thing happens for the opposite charges. The waves they make due to their standing wave movements meet each other and cancel out each other. So force of attraction kicks now as they are spinning and creating vortex which is sucking everything. So opposite charges attract. And this is the reason why electric and magnetic fields are formed when a charge moves, as these are just waves in the space medium that are formed by the movement and standing wave type movement of a charge itself in the space medium. You can compare this to the waves formed in air behind a large moving vehicle or a fast vehicle throwing away water to the side on a water filled road. Also I believe that in magnetic objects the electrons that are not paired move around the object in a way to create a suction force that attracts the space medium inside through one end and expels it outside through another. This is just like if we dip one end of a pipe in water and suck air through the other end. When air starts moving through the pipe it creates a suction force and the water also moves in through one end of a pipe and comes out of another. And this is the reason why we can create electromagnets if we move charge or current through a metal. I believe that the same thing happens inside that metal and electrons start to move in a direction creating a suction force that pulls in space medium from one side and pulls out it from another. And due to this phenomenon magnetic poles are formed and also because of this magnetic objects are attracted towards and repelled from each other. The magnetic pole through which the space medium is going in attracts the pole through which the space medium is coming out and vice versa. So same poles repel while opposite poles attract each other.

Question 41 : What is the proof that shows that space is a superfluid medium?
Scientists currently don’t believe that space is a superfluid medium but their own observations and experiments show otherwise. Here are some experiments, observations and facts that show that maybe space is indeed a superfluid medium. 
Wave particle duality of all matter and energy -
All scientists believe that every form of matter and energy show wave particle duality, meaning that they behave as a wave as well as a particle. I believe this is a clear indication that maybe they show this duality because they are a part of the space medium. Since this medium is made up of fundamental particles, the matter which is standing wave of this medium and the energy which is traveling wave of this medium, show wave particle duality. Think of it like air and water. Air and water are both mediums that are made up of particles but waves are also being formed in them. So space is also just like these two mediums.
Conversion of matter into energy and vice versa -
We know that matter can be converted into energy and we also know that energy can also be converted into matter. So is it wrong to assume that maybe it is possible because they are part of something which we have not discovered yet. That is the space medium. Matter which is a standing wave of this superfluid medium can be converted into energy because it is a travelling wave of this medium and vice versa. 
The double slit experiment -
The double slit experiment also proves the existence of a medium as even a single matter particle causes wave interference pattern when travelling through a double slit. I think that this happens because whenever anything moves in the superfluid space medium, waves are formed. Due to this, the waves made by the matter particle, moving through the double slit interferes with each other to make the pattern. Also when this particle is observed this pattern is destroyed because by observation we introduce more waves in the experiment that destroy the neat interference between the waves of a single particle. 
Dark matter and dark energy -
Scientists believe that alongside visible matter, there is also a lot of matter that we don’t see and observe. They call it Dark matter. Also alongside electromagnetic energy, there is a type of energy called dark energy which is responsible for the expansion of the universe, that we currently can’t observe or interact with. I believe these two unknowns are proof of the existence of the superfluid space medium. Dark matter is the medium itself, currently undetected. And dark energy are the waves being formed in this medium, some of which were formed in this medium during the big bang that are still pushing everything away from each other. Also since space medium is currently undetected, all the waves being formed in this medium that are also undetected currently, are considered as dark energy. 
Electromagnetic field and Higgs field-
Scientist currently believe that there are two fields that permeates throughout the whole universe. These are called electromagnetic field and Higgs field. Higgs field gives mass to the particles and the electromagnetic field is responsible for energy. I believe that if you replace Higgs field with big space medium particle and electromagnetic field with small space medium particle and just accept that these two make the space medium that permeates throughout the entire universe then it solves all the problems and issues with our current model of Physics.
Solar sail-
   Just like wind sails that are using wind to move a boat, scientists believe that we can make a solar sail that can use sunlight to move a small spaceship. So just like waves of air and water that can push things, we have a very clear example of sunlight, which I believe is a wave of the space medium, pushing objects. Here is an article about it.

Nothing can’t create something- 
The existence of the universe itself is the biggest proof that such a medium exists as nothing can’t create something. As scientists have clearly found that even empty space is full of energy. This energy is not coming from nothing but are just waves being formed and travelling in the superfluid space medium. 
        I think all these facts, observations and experiments prove that space is indeed a medium.

f77yku,Delta0211,Research on Materials in Space,"Hey guys,

I am a BTech Mech 3rd yr student. I have to do my 4th-year project next year for which I have to decide what I am going to do in the coming month and submit a report.

If you go through my posts, I am very interested in Hybrid Rocket Engines and up until now, I had decided to make an experimental setup and do some basic research on it as my 4th-year project. I have good understanding and some experience and I feel I will be able to do this given a year and some pressure of marks.

But I want to explore and see what other projects I can do which are related to propulsion in some form or the other since that is what I am passionate about. I came across this [website](https://materialsinspace.nasa.gov/MISSE_Materials) from NASA which has data on Various Materials in Space, I would like to explore this more. 

My **QUESTION** being, Can you guys suggest what kind of research or project I can do, (using software or making physical prototypes, or test units) with the data provided by NASA ( i don't know exactly what do they provide, since I haven't gotten an approval yet, still in the process).

If you guys have any other ideas or would like to collaborate please let me know in the comments.",4,1582271913,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f77yku/research_on_materials_in_space/,space,1

I’ve been thinking about the Big Bang and just been coming up with more and more questions about the universe. So if you guys want to talk about it just comment ideas and theories and stuff, my questions are.. 
What if there were multiple big bangs in the universe(s) and our Solar system/galaxy and possibly (our)  universe is one of the most recent ones that was created? There’s really no way to answer that question because we’ll never know. Another question, if there are other life forms out their in space, Whos to say what part of time they’re in. Do you guys think there’s solar systems out there that are just “starting” their “big bang” and developing life as we speak , what about solar systems and galaxies that experienced their “Big Bang” 100s of billions or even trillions of years before ours and have life that are billions or trillions of years ahead of us? I have more questions with no possible answers, but I’ll just stop because I too have an infinite amount of questions and thoughts and theories on space.

f6p5q4,OLSAU,"A novel solution to the Fermi-Paradox, and more ...","Intelligent aliens with advanced tech, ""free"" energy and UFO-type travel, will **never** form major civilizations, and hence not be detectable by us.

**Think about it like this**: The only prerequisite for *all* advanced civilizations to disintegrate at post-scarcity point, is that high intelligence *only* evolves in creatures who naturally live in small tight-knit groups, like we observe here on Earth; Humans, Apes, Dolphins, Parrots, Wolves etc.

In other words: All species will evolve with some variant of ""Dunbar's Number"". And every species will revert to their natural social order, when nothing forces them to clump together in large civilizations.

**Just ask yourself**: If you had your every need met for free, and could travel anywhere in the universe ... Would you remain in your apartment, and work in a stressful competitive environment? ... Or ... Would you travel the Galaxy, with family and friends?

Yea, that's right baby ... Space-Tribes ! ... Hard to detect with current human technology, and thus an evolution-based, universal solution to the Fermi-Paradox.

Thinking about that, space-tribes could also explain the many diverse and odd UFO-encounters humans report. The lack of cohesion suggests, that aliens might come visiting in small individual groups, each with their own culture and agenda.

Furthermore, if every advanced civilization \*must\* disintegrate at post-scarcity point, and our government/elite somehow knows this, it could explain all the secrecy, disinformation and holding back of advanced technology many suspect. Our elite would almost certainly seek to keep human civilization, and their own familiar position in it, going for as long as possible, by actively crippling humanity's ability to reach post-scarcity.

Our elite might even collaborate with some of the visitors, and deliberately fight others. Possibly hoping to gain some alien tech, but ultimately working to keep aliens from ""spilling the beans"" to a broader human audience. Logic being, that small, benign tribes won't pose a huge military threat, while more aggressive tribes, you seek collaboration with.

That dynamic however, portrays humanity as repelling friendly contact, while cultivating clandestine collaboration with the worst possible alien specimens ... Not a good look for humanity, I would argue.

Anyway, this space-tribe-idea not only offer a plausible universal solution the long-standing Fermi-Paradox, but also predicts almost everything the UFO-field have postulated for decades.

f6js23,Marisa_Nya,Opinion: The universe being large and young in itself combined with a possibly small probability of organic life to emerge probably accounts for why we haven’t seen intelligent life?,"I saw this sentiment while reading something today regarding “The Great Filter(s)”, which was how if there were intelligent life, would they have not found us by now?

I want to refute this hard. Let me go through my thought process:

-Many would say that although Earth-like planets forming are numerous in our own galaxy, even if early formation volcanism combined with other natural phenomenon and the availability of water created lipid bilayers that form bubbles, complex organics that can be read as RNA, a way for primitive cells to either make energy (photosynthesis) or take it from its environment (geologically active vents spewing organic material) formed, some way of catalyzing molecules was available (it’s really hard to believe proto-cells even had something as complex as glycolysis, which needs multiple enzymes and reduces an organic molecule to store the energy rather than using the energy as soon as the bonds of carbs break), and any sort of motility was formed (who KNOWS how that emerged), all of that would have to come together and THEN replicate in order to spread and not die before passing on life itself. I’m sorry, that sentence is way longer than I wanted it to be, but my point is that the extra bit of the process of cell-division and DNA replication involves such complex proteins, it’s simply a miracle. Though I wouldn’t be surprised if the first cells replicated RNA sequences with other RNA and the again to create the original sequences, almost like a virus. Nor would I be surprised if viruses came before cells, in the primitive form of RNA, with no protein shells, and happened to function as a self-replicant by pairing and breaking with random nucleic acids. Really, the amount of luck involved with the emergence of life is ASTRONOMICAL.

So you might ask why I’m insisting that there’s extraterrestrial intelligent life even at this moment. Simple:

-Such odds would still be possible to replicate many times between all the star systems in all the galaxies of the universe. It’s far too extensive for this not to be the case.

However, it’s still because of that extensiveness that perhaps no life at all exists in the Milky Way. If so, any intelligent life, even those who have begun to colonize other star systems in their own galaxy, may never be able to make out our existence, and even if they had away, were so far in light years that we wouldn’t be detectable as a technological civilization. Which of course leads into the fact that

-We’ve only been putting things into space for as long as my Grandpa has been alive. Maybe we’re too much in our infancy to be detected at all?

Lastly, and personally my favourite thought/point about this

-The universe has (likely) only been around for 13.77 Billion years. While a long time, on astronomic scales it’s still so little. We expect the universe to keep producing stars at a reasonable rate for trillions of years; if I remember correctly, we might be in one of only 2% of the first star systems our universe will experience. I imagine that a civilization born when the universe is 50% through (long enough for plenty of intelligent life, without being so far into universal expansion that space-faring becomes impossible) might actually encounter alien life or evidence of past intelligent life more readily.

f682dm,Marisa_Nya,What is the future of ion propulsion? Have any probes been suggested that would use ion propulsion to reach much further into the solar system in palpable time periods?,"This just came to mind randomly because I was reading about New Horizons' encounter with Ultima Thule. I've seen it pretty well documented considering the Dawn mission itself uses it. Of course, Dawn was a mission that focused on asteroid belt objects, and was able to get orbits around Ceres and Vesta BECAUSE of the ion system. It's known to be many times more efficient and cost-effective than normal chemical propulsion, which is why a few conventional satellites also use it.

However, despite it being talked about here and there, I don't think NASA has announced the use of the engine for outer space travel, at least I believe? Dawn accumulated speed from ion propulsion, plus initial thrust, and plus a speed boost from a Mars flyby to reach about 24,000 mph. There are theoretical limits of speed for a probe the mass of Dawn all the way towards 200,000 mph, but they also require massive amounts of xenon gas and have other practical complications.

&amp;#x200B;

Point is, I've read about ion propulsion on and off, but haven't seen it talked about in context of deeper space travel. Quite frankly, it's the best we have with our current technology, why not push it towards the theoretical max so that it's within the realm of possibility that the Kuiper Belt could be explored. Our technology with energy itself is also getting better, so perhaps in a decade one would also be built to be powered that long and not die.",11,1582102134,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f682dm/what_is_the_future_of_ion_propulsion_have_any/,space,1

Large-scale “plans” were announced to create a space research center, build a spaceport facility in the international airport in Curacao, replete with an experimental center there to entertain space tourists. 

In June 2012, the SXC announced the sale of 175 tickets at a price of $95,000 for the flights of  XCOR Aerospace, the developer of rocket engines and rocket plans. 

In June 2014, XCOR took over the SXC, resulting in the creation of the XCOR Space Expeditions Division, which continued to sell space tickets. After the takeover, Michiel remained to lead the division.

Plans remained unchanged until June 2017, when the company announced financial difficulties. In November of the same year, the company went bankrupt. In total, at the time of bankruptcy, 282 tickets had sold for almost $26.8 million. The company did not reimburse the money to deceived customers.

Having lost hope of getting back their investments, ticket holders decided to go to court. A class action lawsuit is being prepared against the company and Michiel Jan Mol. In addition, prosecutors from several states turned their attention to the scam.

The C.I.A. is known to recycle common criminals as hot men and mercenaries for this purpose, authorized to commit crime as a clandestine quasi-military authority ranging from petty nuisance fraud to homicidal assassination under a foreign guise of a protectorate and no fear of civilian criminal prosecution.  The designation of outer space has no bearing on this matter as a circumstantial jurisdiction.  This is not the first crime in a extra-jurisdictional capacity in outer space because it corresponds to a quasi-military international jurisdiction.

Inspection is a common, redundant tasks relegated to underrepresented minorities or women incapacitated by cultural stressors mitigating their economic means.  It is smoke thing of an apologist entreaty regarded as an alternative to a church tax shelter for demographics still considered in a developmental stage.

The private market swells and deflated on a dime, enough for chump change for a phonebooth call to phone home and is more volatile than the currency, prime rate, or inflation and can be escaped through bankruptcy, a common protection for debtors and creditors from the government court system.

The way it was explained to me is this: The Government suddenly decided that deep space missions were too risky, so they cancelled the Saturn program and instead focused on the idea of a 'safe, cheap' spaceplane; for low earth orbits. But then the committees got involved again, and the Shuttle became hugely overdesigned; for the same reason someone's trying to give Artemis to Boeing.

As a result, the cost of actually operating the shuttle was twenty times what it should have been; and the shuttles stayed in operation for 30 years, instead of the 15 it was meant for.

I was also taught that because of this 'overbuilding', the shuttle had to run at 110% of specs; so they had to dismantle the engines for inspection every time they launched/landed; thus defeating the whole purpose.

My question is, how accurate am I on that; and more importantly, how likely is that it will happen again? (Part asking about the future, part asking for a story I'm writing).",22,1581976860,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f5gk52/is_artemis_the_new_space_shuttle/,space,1

- There are some rare materials on some bodies, and, even if that is true, that would still only mean that there's a point to sending a bunch of robots there to mine out the place, with maybe a skeleton crew that carries some sort of kill switch to slag the place in case the robots get up to some naughty shit.

- People are just going to do it cause they can, and, while yes, some people with the money are going to do it just because, I really don't see that resulting in any sort of large-scale colonization of any other places in the solar system.

- People have a natural urge to explore, which is true and has resulted in us advancing to where we are now, but that still doesn't eliminate the problem of financing your little adventure, especially if the places you can mine or make stuff on are already set up to be automatized because of the numerous advantages that has.

f4tbie,Killjoys13,I spotted a very bright dot on the night sky which is much brighter than the stars.,"At around 7:30 pm, I looked at the sky and there was this small but very [bright dot](https://imgur.com/a/eflMZGw) which stood out in the sky full of light pollution. I had seen this  yesterday too but I ignored it for being a star, but today when I looked  at [other stars](https://imgur.com/a/s900nhE), they were very faint while this 'dot' was exceptionally bright.

It seemed to be static but I checked it after 2 hours and it had moved near the horizon and looked [reddish](https://imgur.com/a/rHrNs3s) in colour. It looked like Mars, but again, brighter.

As it had moved so quickly, it can't be a star. Also, if you think this the 'Pole star' then you're wrong cause this is on the south west direction. I don't how fast satellites move but I think they are a lot  faster than this are not visible in a highly light polluted sky.

f4l59e,stereomatch,"Scientists now able to analyze a Moon dust grain sample atom by atom, using Atom Probe Tomography, where the material is evaporated off a sharp tip atom-by-atom - thus gaining info on the 3D composition/placement of elements within the sample - allowing analysis of surface vs interior of a sample","News coverage:

- [Scientists Have Found a Way to Extract Information From a Single Grain of Moon Dust](https://www.sciencealert.com/ingenious-new-method-extracts-precious-details-from-a-single-grain-of-moon-dust-3)

&gt;APT, the ingenious technique that gives us this access, is so sensitive, it can image a tiny sample of material atom-by-atom, giving researchers a powerful 3D analysis of the source.
&gt;
&gt;To analyse a grain of Moon dust with APT, geophysicist Jennika Greer at the University of Chicago prepared a needle-shaped sample just a few hundred atoms wide - she carved this teeny tiny pillar out of the grain with a focused beam of charged atoms.
&gt;
&gt;Then came the atom probe part - using a laser, the researchers knocked atoms off their needle-shaped sample one by one, watching each atom fly off and strike a detector plate.
&gt;
&gt;Certain elements will fly off the sample at different rates, and this allowed researchers to analyse the sample's true composition and texture. For instance, it takes iron longer to reach the detector plate compared to hydrogen, because it's a heavier element.
&gt;
&gt;The authors say this is the first time we have been able to see both the types of atoms and their exact locations in a tiny grain of lunar soil. Even better, because they took so little material off the grain, the original sample is still largely intact and available for future research.
&gt;
&gt;""This technique has such high sensitivity and resolution, you find things you wouldn't find otherwise and only use up a small bit of the sample,"" says Heck.
&gt;
&gt;The results have already convinced NASA to fund three years of study on lunar dust, using APT to quantify the water content and level of space weathering.
&gt;
&gt;The Moon's soil has been so deeply altered by this weathering, what lies inside the satellite likely doesn't match its exterior. By understanding how the surface has changed, the authors of the new study hope we can somehow reverse the clock and try and figure out what lunar soil once used to be.
&gt;
&gt;In the nanoscale 3D map Greer and colleagues created of their Moon dust sample, the team notes several products of space weathering, including microphase iron, hydrogen and even a vesicle that may have once been filled with ions from solar wind.

&gt;Atom Probe Tomography (APT) is a microscopy technique that provides 3D atom-by-atom imaging of materials with a uniquely powerful combination of spatial and chemical resolution. A wide range of materials can be analyzed including metals, alloys, intermetallics, semi-conductors, thin films and oxide scales. Features that are typically studied are for example phase compositions, phase separation, concentration gradients, clustering and segregation to grain boundaries, phase boundaries and dislocations. The sensitivity is the same for all element (except for hydrogen), including the light elements like C, O and N. The technique is based on field evaporation of ions from a very sharp needle-shaped sample. Electropolishing or FIB/SEM is applied to fabricate suitable samples.",1,1581825373,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f4l59e/scientists_now_able_to_analyze_a_moon_dust_grain/,space,1

f4kjzl,Derpolicious,Question about the big bang,"So the big bang as I understand it says that everything in the observable universe can be traced back to a single point. Further observations show that the universe is expanding and not only that, but the rate of expansion is accelerating. What if the big bang is an endless recurring phenomena of expansion followed by contraction? (I remember hearing about this somewhere) With the rate of expansion increasing, it would seem contraction is out of the question. What if it's not though? What if the rate of expansion just hasn't yet peaked? If there is an eventual peak, maybe gravity is able to start pulling everything back to that single point leading to another big bang? The 2nd law of thermal dynamics would disagree here, but if all the matter there ever was truly collapsed to the originating point like this wouldn't the exact same conditions be met for an identical big bang?

f4fxq2,amaurea,"The star S62 orbits the Milky Way's central black hole. Its orbit was recently measured, and found to reach 7% of the speed of light (76 million km/h), making it by far the fastest known star.","See the [sortable table on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*#Orbiting_stars). The second-to-last column gives the speed as a percentage of the speed of light.

For comparison the extreme hypervelocity star [S5-HSV1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S5-HVS1), which is the fastest known star not orbiting a supermassive black hole, which was also recently discovered, moves at 6 million km/h. S5-HSV used to also orbit the same black hole, but was ejected by a close encounter between two stars 4.8 million years ago.

Another comparison is the Earth's orbital speed around the sun, which is just 0.1 million km/h.

A hypothetical planet orbiting this star (though it would be hard for a star to keep its planets in this environment) would experience a relativistic doppler effect of 7%, enough to shift red light into yellow when looking in the direction of the orbit. It would also experience a modest time dilation of less than 0.1%.

The area around the black hole is extremely crowded with stars, so we can only see the brighter ones that stand out from the crowd. Future, higher resolution telescopes should improve this. It is likely that this will let us discover stars on even closer orbits than this.",5,1581801627,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f4fxq2/the_star_s62_orbits_the_milky_ways_central_black/,space,1

f3pgql,AnakinWayneII,The first manned Mars mission should (defensive) weapons/an armed escort?,"Hear me out.

This is a ""just in case"" plan.

Now, we're not saying that there is anything to worry about which would require an armed response/defensive actions - and there's no evidence that any entity or nation has any ill intent/capabilities to carry out threatening acts or even evidence to point the existence of extraterrestrials, let alone hostile extraterrestrials with military capabilities.

*However* (and it's a very big however), perhaps an armed escort or defensive capabilities should be considered for any first manned Mars (whether private or otherwise). It is up to whichever entities organising the very first manned Mars mission how they wish to incorporate this (this could, for example, be in the form of conventional small arms taken along etc - it's anyone's guess how you could incorporate any weapons on the actual craft(s)/vessel(s)).

f3f8eq,JoaoRaiden,College student desperate for a ride to Kennedy Space Center to watch the Starlink launch on saturday (15th)," Hey guys! I'm a college student from Brazil working at Disney and managed to buy myself a ticket to watch the Starlink 4 launch Saturday (15th) from the LC-39 Gandry (they sell out in like, minutes).. The problem is, I have no car nor the means to rent one all by myself (and the shuttle options to KSC arrive too late to catch the launch).

Does anyone know anybody that is going to be at Kennedy Space Center on saturday(15th) before 10AM and could potentially give me a ride there from somewhere in/near Orlando? I can pay for the gas and everything else. My only other viable option is taking an uber and that would cost me $200 alone :/, it's way more than I can afford.

I'm a HUGE space enthusiast and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me, I don't think I'll have another chance to come here within the next decade so any help would mean the world to me.

f30rkf,MiniCrab,The concept of time and light through space,"I have a serious inquiry about how time works.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say for instance there is a life-filled planet 10 light years away from Earth. We are aware of them and they are aware of us. We have a treaty and promise to help each other out in the event that either planet hits an apocalyptic state.

Lets say that time is synced between the two planets and their date is the same as ours.

Now lets imagine that their planet hits the apocalypse and the inhabitants send an unmanned space craft to Earth that can travel at the speed of light.

Now lets imagine that the instant the space craft leaves their atmosphere their planet explodes in a fiery ball visible for hundred of light years around.

The craft is moving towards Earth at 1 light year per year equaling to 10 years to reach Earth.

Now after 10 years the space craft hits Earth and inside we find a note with the date they sent the craft and the situation they are in. The date is exactly 10 years ago.

Right away scientists on Earth look into space via telescope or whatever towards their planet. We see it explode exactly 10 years later right?

So now to us the planet just blew up, but really it happened 10 years ago via the proof in the space craft.

My question now is, did the planet blow up when we got the letter or did it explode 10 years ago and we only see the perceivable light 10 years later?",2,1581552004,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f30rkf/the_concept_of_time_and_light_through_space/,space,1

f300nz,jessemercury,What are the implications of Elon Musk starting a new society on Mars?,"As many of you have probably heard, Elon Musk has announced plans to send 1 million people to Mars by 2050 in his fleet of Starship rockets currently under construction. He wants to offer loans to anyone who wants to go, with plentiful job opportunities on the red planet. I've been thinking about the implications of one rich man being in charge of who gets to start a new society on another planet, and it's a huge can of worms. What will the demographics be of the people that go? Will the diversity of Earth be represented fairly, or will institutionalized racism influence the selection process? Is there a government on Mars? Is Elon Musk the emperor of a million person strong human civilization?!? I'm super interested to hear your thoughts.

2. What is the glow around the shadow. 

3. Why are there sun bursts either side. 

4. Why are the shadows not pointing in the same direction? For this I offered that maybe it's because the pics were taken at different times so the shadows moved.

f2zb3h,camdeneagles,Repeating Fast Radio Burst Paper,"Hi guys,

Below is a snippet from a paper about the FRB repeating every 16.35 days. Link to the paper and a news article about it below.

I’m not 100% sure I completely understand the paper, please let me know if it means that it’s 16.35 days exactly every time, or if that’s averages out.
———————————-

From September 2018 to November 2019, CHIME/FRB has detected a total of 28 bursts from FRB 180916.J0158+65, which remains the most active source from this recent CHIME/FRB repeater sample. The barycentric arrival times for the 28 bursts (includ- ing those has been published before) from FRB 180916.J0158+65, corrected for delays from pulse dispersion, are listed in Extended Data Table 1.
To search for periodicity, the burst arrival times (spanning a 400-day time range) were folded with different periods from 1.57 to 62.8 days (see Methods), with a Pearson’s χ2
11 2
test applied to each resulting profile with 8 phase bins . A reduced χ ≫ 1 with respect
to a uniform distribution indicates a periodicity unlikely to arise by chance. Furthermore, to account for the possible non-Poissonian statistics of the bursts12, we have applied the search with different weighting schemes that consider clustered bursts of different time range to be correlated events (see Methods).
Searches with different weightings return periodograms of similar shape and have the same primary peak with significance varying between 3.5 − 8σ. As an example, the reduced χ2 versus period using a weighting that counts only active days instead of indi- vidual events is shown in Figure 1a. A distinct peak is detected at 16.35 ± 0.18 days, with a probability of chance occurence ∼ 10−7 (equivalent to 5σ), accounting for the number of independent periods searched. The other χ2 peaks correspond to harmonics and sub- harmonics of the period, with the one at 32.7 days being the next most prominent. As a check, the same procedure was run on two types of control samples (1) a mock data set, consisting of burst arrival times randomly sampled according to the daily exposure of FRB 180916.J0158+65 with the full width half maxumum (FWHM) of the telescopes synthesize beams at 600 MHz (Figure 1b) and (2) randomly selected pulses from Galac- tic radio pulsars of similar declination detected by CHIME/FRB (Figure 1c) which have the same limited daily exposure and long-term sensitivity changes as the data for FRB 180916.J0158+65. The 16.35-day periodicity is absent in the control samples, and with 106 sets of control samples of each type, no other periods have reached the level of sig- nificance of the 16.35-day period for FRB 180916.J0158+65 by chance coincidence.
Alternative search methods, such as folding the events and evaluating the resulting profiles using the H-test13, and discrete Fourier transform searches with incoherent har- monic summing14, also return the 16.35-day period, with nominal significances between 4 and 11σ under various assumptions (see Methods).

f2xy86,Synaptic_Impulse,Astronomical Gossip!,"As many of you know... The Everyday Astronaut (Tim Dodd) took a shot at the bow of this subreddit yesterday, worried that some of the changes and increasing number of rules here (Thou Shalt Not!) might be reaching a point of becoming too stifling for further creative growth. 

And fair enough... 

No subreddit is perfect. 

And ALL subreddits need to take time now and then to seriously step back and contemplate their future direction. 

--------------------------------

As such... for the fun of it, trying to do my part in response to Tim, I made a quick fake satirical subreddit /r/cosmicnoise, with a hint of seriousness in exploring how to improve and maybe ""ease up"" a bit on the rules for our beloved r/space subreddit, just enough to keep the spark of fun, intrigue, and passion for space flowing. 

As well, in doing so... I experimented with making an article there called: 

""Astronomical Gossip!"" 

To see what I mean, you can click [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmicnoise/comments/f2vom2/astronomical_gossip_feb_12_2020/) to see it. 

--------------------------------

But ya, as you can see there, anyone well versed in space exploration will totally get a lot of the jokes and fun-loving ""gossip"" about the scientists and astronomers and educators listed in that article. (Hopefully they will find it funny!?)

At the same time, newbies might also be highly intrigued by this fresher style, and want to click on, and learn more about space-exploration science, from many of the best sources, perhaps? 

So yes, as we scramble as a community to swallow our pride and respond to Tim... 

Maybe some creative experimenting and brain storming like this might show us some new fun directions, that will spark passion in space-exploration for the new generation, all the while also maintaining a level of respectability, and sophistication of posts.",0,1581541001,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f2xy86/astronomical_gossip/,space,1

At the very least: it was a challenging blast and shot to the bow for change to this subreddit! 

The question now: how do we, as a community, with so many of us who still love and feel passionately about this subreddit, respond? 

All in all, my personal response: I both strongly agreed with him, and strongly disagreed with him on various aspects. And if that sounds highly confusingly contradictory to you... then... well... it is! 

As such, in my defense, in the spirit of the poet of Walt Whitman: 

“Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself; I am large -- I contain multitudes.”

Just like space itself. 

Which is the very exact subject this subreddit should be trying to capture. 

(No small task, that's for sure!) 

--------------------------------

Anyways, fancy-rhetorical-poetics aside...  

I just wanted to propose to first break the ice in response, and offer to contribute a periodic post that I want to call: 

""Astronomical Gossip!"" 

--------------------------------

So ya... to see what I mean by this suggestion, I created a quick side-model of a subreddit, called: 

r/cosmicnoise

There if you click on the top pinned article-post, you'll see how I want to creatively satirize the ""hollywood-gossip-style"" of reporting, with actual interesting, useful, educational space news and links. 

Also there, on the side-bar (right side), I listed a kind of tongue-and-cheek and yet semi-serious possible sample for a slight easing of the rules we might want to pursue in the future here at r/space? 

Although I suspect my sample rules on that side bar are a bit too far and lenient and out to left field for conservative moderators... 

So obviously we may not want to go quite that far...

But still... there's some directions we may want to consider as a community?

--------------------------------

Anyways... 

Take a look if you have a chance... and maybe we can all begin thinking about some changes and new directions, to keep this subreddit alive, and vibrant!",4,1581534352,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f2w7m3/in_response_to_the_everyday_astronauts_challenge/,space,1

f2tmhe,Azar002,Some perspective on relative distances.,"Hopefully this helps you ""feel"" how far some astronomical distances stretch.

Milky Way is 100,000 light years across. Hard to picture as an actual distance.

Our neighboring stars are a little over 4 light years away. Long ways. Or is it? 

To put it in perspective, plop the Milky Way galaxy over the United States, so it stretches from New York to Los Angeles, about 3000 miles. Now how far is tjat 4.22 light years?

300 yards. 3 football fields and you have walked to the next nearest star. Now walk to Los Angeles to walk to the edge of the galaxy.

This figure (0.0042%) can be applied to time as well.

If the 3000 miles is represented by 68 million years (when the dinosaurs met their astronomic end) than the 300 yards is 2800 years. So go back to 800 B.C. and you have travelled to the next star, but go back 68 million years and you have spanned the Milky Way.

Nearest store is 1.4 miles away? That is the Milky Way end to end. Distance to the nearest star? One hair's width.

Earth is 4 billion years old. That is the Milky Way. Nearest star? 200,000 years. Oldest homo sapien skeleton is 200,000 years old. We have only been on this earth for 300 yards out of 3000 miles.

I have kind of a random question for everyone.  A few years ago I stumbled upon a news article about some detection of something in outer space and i am trying to find it again.  The problem is my memory of the article is poor at this point but I do have some recollection of some of its key points.  I am hoping that somebody will recognize it after I mention those key points.  I remember it mentioned something about a pattern for which a probability of authenticity was calculated.  The article said that either the signal was legitimate or someone faked it by setting some events in motion approximately 400 years ago, which was extremely unlikely but I think a probability was calculated.  I am trying to figure why it was narrowed to those two possibilities instead of just one but I need to see the article again.  Does an article like this seem familiar to anyone?  It would have been written a few years ago",2,1581483288,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f2lu04/looking_for_an_old_article_about_signal_detection/,space,1

f2bn7f,RavingLuhn,How do you navigate through space?,"This is a question that I've had for quite a while. 

On earth, navigation makes sense and is fairly easy to grasp the concept of. I can use GPS, landmarks, and maps to determine where I am, and if I track my velocity and heading I can calculate where I've traveled. I can use a watch combined with the sun, the stars, a magnetic compass, and a host of other indicators to tell me whether or not I've moved, and how fast. (this is probably an oversimplification, but you get what I'm trying to say) Cars have speedometers and odometers, planes use altimeters and airspeed indicators, etc. 

But how does this work in space? 

Let's pretend that I'm in a spacecraft that's currently in an equatorial orbit 20 miles above earth. How do I know how far above the planet I am? How would I measure my velocty and trajectory? 

Is this all dependent upon computers and having a starting reference point?",9,1581442131,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f2bn7f/how_do_you_navigate_through_space/,space,1

f2ajjj,everydayastronaut,A rant about /r/space from a professional space educator,"Back in the day, /r/space wasn’t a default subreddit and in those days, every single day I’d read some awesome article, see an inspiring image, or see up-to-date space news. 

This subreddit is what helped me fall in love with spaceflight and space. I learned so much and was so inspired that I couldn’t get enough and eventually became a professional YouTube educator under the name [“Everyday Astronaut”](http://youtube.com/everydayastronaut).

These days I feel like this sub is a graveyard. Stripped down to press releases, occasional NASA tweets and the occasional rocket photograph. Why?! Why is nothing allowed in this sub?

Why can’t people post crazy stories from the Apollo era, why can’t rocket photographers and cinematographers post awesome footage of rocket launches, why can’t breaking news or tweets from non official accounts be shared? 

This place could be the hub it used to be, where I learned, was inspired and stayed on top of current space science and spaceflight events. Now that’s reserved for /r/SpaceX and a few other active subs. 

My point is, without this place, I don’t think I would have been inspired to pursue my career. And I just don’t see that happening anymore. What’s the worst that happens? Too much space and rockets on the front page? Oh no!!! Heaven forbid we get more people excited to learn more about the exciting things going on!

Can we tweak the rules to actually see some proper community and activity around here again? Please!!

It would be great.

This structure supported by the astrological symbol for the sun indicates the nature of space travel through transplanar geometry consisting of plotting a linear slope on a decentralized graph.  Time does not exist in outer space and is relative rather than linear because of the effect of gravity and can only be understood beyond angelic language in human symbolism by an atomic clock indicating a linear start and stop segment on an uniplanar axis.  Lore about the structure of the lost city of Atlantis also correspond to a set of concentric circles.

But while I was in Tunisia (city of El Borma) I used my telescope at night and the app on my phone was showing me constellations that I am not familiar with (as I live in UK so I only see the Northern Constellations) . I used my telescope for a few days while there and every time it was showing me star constellations in the southern hemisphere.  I actually had to go on internet afterwards and type the names in because I was that confused lol and yes they were all southern stars and constellations. 

I don't know if there was some bug with the app or it was broken, but now I am back in UK its exactly same as before and showing me North Constellations,  so I really can't understand why I was seeing the Southern Sky.

 Observations reveal a “bulk flow” in the local Universe which is faster  and extends to much larger scales than are expected around a typical  observer in the standard ΛCDM cosmology. This is expected to result in a  scale-dependent dipolar modulation of the acceleration of the expansion  rate inferred from observations of objects within the bulk flow. From a  maximum-likelihood analysis of the Joint Light-curve Analysis catalogue  of Type Ia supernovae, we find that the deceleration parameter, in  addition to a small monopole, indeed has a much bigger dipole component  aligned with the cosmic microwave background dipole, which falls  exponentially with redshift *z*: *q*0 = *q*m + ***q***d.*n̂* exp(-*z*/*S*). The best fit to data yields *q*d = −8.03 and *S* = 0.0262 (⇒*d* ∼ 100 Mpc), rejecting isotropy (*q*d = 0) with 3.9*σ* statistical significance, while *q*m = −0.157 and consistent with no acceleration (*q*m = 0) at 1.4*σ*.  Thus the cosmic acceleration deduced from supernovae may be an artefact  of our being non-Copernican observers, rather than evidence for a  dominant component of “dark energy” in the Universe.

Are we (Earth) a lucky planet in terms of not getting hit by objects from space? I mean 'lucky' in the sense that we have 2 asteroid fields and 3 gas giants between us and ""space."" Each asteroid field blocks incoming debris from space. Even if an asteroid makes it through the first, it would then have to interact with our three gas giants and how much gravitational pull they exert. Then if SOMETHING still gets by, it needs to go through a 2nd asteroid field. 

This just seems like a lot compared to other systems that I hear about that have ~2-4 planets; as i would believe that asteroid impacts would be far more frequent. 

Maybe this helped life develop on Earth? Maybe it's what allowed larger planets to stay? I don't know and I hope one of you can help.",3,1581300535,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f1jb2m/are_we_earth_a_lucky_planet/,space,1

f1a4dk,Mad-A-Moe,"""Boeing criticizing Boeing"" - Boeing response to a recent OIG report...","Boeing's response to the recent OIG report included this statement in the ""Boeing vs. the competition"" section (see 2nd link below): ""Starliner development and flight prices incorporate the rigorous design, test and verification approach we proposed – leaving no stone unturned to ensure we deliver a quality vehicle and service to our customer. ""

In light of the recent software quality issues, it seems NASA did not get what it paid for.   Sure Boeing will be forced to reexamine and correct their software quality assurance process, but they did not meet the requested schedule.  Schedule  adherence is a key argument for the additional funding. Funding that the OIG felt was unwarranted.    

Additional NASA oversight cost the government (and therefore the taxpayer) more money in the form of additional NASA work.  Yeah, we were going to pay the salaried people anyway but It's highly likely there will  be additional contractor costs...not to mention opportunity costs all around. 

What can be done to fix this mess in  a way that makes things right with the taxpayer?  Is Boeing committed to correcting at their cost?  I have not heard this.  I'm afraid a payment will be made months after everything is settled to reimburse Boeing.

f0vrq5,Ikole,Nuclear-powered reusable LEO booster,"A large elongated cylinder that refuels propellant by taking in air on a very low orbit while using atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion.

Its power source is a nuclear reactor. It cools itself radiatively through its exterior walls.

When ""fueled"", it boosts a payload to a higher orbit (or even to an escape trajectory), using a relatively high-thrust almost-conventional rocket engine, except for the heat, which is provided by the nuclear reactor.

When done, it goes back to LEO for refueling.

Of course, the big weakness of this design is that it needs a nuclear reactor.

Otherwise, it fills an interesting niche. It's more than reusable, as it gathers its propellant. It provides faster access to higher orbits than electric propulsion. It doesn't rely on any speculative technology, and doesn't have particularly tight design constraints.

P.S.: I'm sure this has been thought of before; is there a name for such a system, or a similar project that got studied?",12,1581187596,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/f0vrq5/nuclearpowered_reusable_leo_booster/,space,1

The part of the video that I thought people might like to see is of our actual graduation where Alan Shepard stopped by and spoke to all of us.  Pretty neat.  I didn't see this posted anywhere else and figured it was time to get this video online.  Crazy to think that this video is already over 25 years old and Alan Shepard passed away just a few years later.

ezwr4j,BRADYLA_YouTube,My Theory On Intelligent Alien Life,"1. In Late 2019 The Pentagon Declassified US Navy Footage https://youtu.be/HZeAYsz7rvw
2. They said the craft(s) rose out of the water when they spotted it
3. They said it was a tic tac shape with L shaped antennas/landing gear on its belly
4. No propulsion trails were detected like it was burning chemicals to move
5. It was flying faster than sound and making zero noise and stopping on a dime.

To me this strongly makes me believe that they have places under the ocean where they land for periods of time because L /shapes on the bottom sound a lot like landing to gear as well as tic tac is the shape of submarines to deal with extreme pressure for lengths of time. If you want to extract resources from earth you can get plenty from the ocean aswell as rare minerals. Now this last part is much more of a long shot but I believe they use engines that have magnets much like a type of rail gun that changes its direction in and instant and could fly faster and faster the closer they are put together. And if you want to collect said magnets to build engines the earth’s core is filled with them. But the one thing I have zero clue is that they broke the sound barrier without making sound like a jet would which breaks physics and it’s very confusing.

Tell me what you think of the theory, maybe what’s wrong with it if anything, more info, do you think I’m right?",9,1581014494,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ezwr4j/my_theory_on_intelligent_alien_life/,space,1

It is known though, of course, that there is a culture on Twitter of NDT tweet-haters...and these are usually in response to his tweets that seem annoyingly self-justified and brainy. 

I used to deny other people’s accusations of him as being a smartass, until I started questioning if his charisma originates solely for his enthusiasm from space, of it it was instead his enthusiasm to show off. 

I couldn’t deny it would feel empowering to know so much about your field in science, but I feel like his fame has given Neil a god-like complex.

And now, whenever I hear him talk on any kind of show, I wonder if he’s more excited to talk about the universe or if he just gets some kind of narcissistic-pleasure to hear himself lecture. 

Probably a little bit of both. My guess would be 80/20% showing off versus teaching.",7,1580980701,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ezputt/am_i_the_only_one_who_feels_like_neil_degrasse/,space,1

ezos6r,AnakinWayneII,"Is a timeframe for humanity becoming a Type III Civilization within 500,000 Earth years too ambitious?","Ubiquitous interstellar travel may actually take some time.

The way humans operate and how societies on Earth are structured may be slowing things down drastically.

Becoming a Type I civilization may take between 200 and 500+ years (remember, this is the whole planet, not just developer regions in North America and Europe - South America, Africa, Asia etc).

Becoming a Type II civilization may take between 300 and 1000+ years.

Type III? It gets a bit difficult here. Ubiquitous interstellar travel is challenging. Successful terraforming takes time and is not super-easy and required multistaged processes. ""Habitable"" planets - in the conventional sense - could be few and far between.

This is why the timeframe, although eye-popping with the amount of zeroes (500,000 years), may actually seem a little ambitious...

Scenario: 

* Earth-sized planet orbits a black hole.
* Radiant heating is provided by cosmic microwave background radiation that has been gravitational focused and blueshifted to give 589 - 2600 W/m² but peaking in the UV (80-175 nm).
* The black hole needs to be supermassive (163 million solar masses or 37 times the mass of Sagittarius A\*) to ensure the planet doesn't get tidally torn apart.
* The planet would orbit extremely close (102.2 thousand km) to the event horizon (its radius is 1.613 AU or 246 million km), with a time dilation factor of 2500-5450.
* To allow such a close-in stable orbit, the black hole also needs to be rotating extremely fast (164 millionth of a percent short of the speed of light).",28,1580931337,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ezezzl/new_paper_describes_a_toy_scenario_in_which_a/,space,1

My question is whether there is a simple equation to calculate the flexibility/resistance My question is whether there is a simple equation to calculate the flexibility/resistance/density of let's say a mattress on the surface of Mars(Gravity is 38% that of Earth's), to make it feel the same as it does on Earth.

eza00o,fermenton,Paper on cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of science/space projects,"Everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently had an interesting discussion with my former thesis advisor, which is PhD on economics, about the real impact of scientific development/space exploration.

He argued that never saw an academic paper about CBA on the subject  (eg. Manhattan Project, Apollo/Gemini program). Also observed that people only account for benefits and not direct costs, opportunity costs, yields of taxpayers funds and so on.

He has a classic liberal-libertarian view of society, which for me, is pure ideology. So, his view is always concerned on taxpayers funds efficiency usage and hoping less possible government intervention (nowadays is happening).

For me, it is clear that benefits outweights costs. Specially in terms of technological advances, that means qualitative leap in several processes and therefore increases in productivity and life quality. However, I couldn't find any paper on the subject.

More than having the discussion done, I'd like to have reference on authors and articles that analyses science development in the context of economic analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance community,

趕緊設計室內的裝潢，或是請設計公司幫你的新屋進行設計，

但我們往往都會忘記了某些小細節，而造成入住時發現整體感覺跟期望中的有差，

就以[窗簾](https://trade.1111.com.tw/web/0422472216/)的挑選就是一個很容易忽略的地方，

常常有人認為窗簾，只不過是來遮陽的加劇而已，

其實並不盡然，窗簾的搭配有助於您屋內整體的感覺

假如一個淺眠且有一點光就不能入睡的人你在他的房間中搭配的是淺色的窗簾，當稍微的光線就會讓他整晚無法入眠。

這時候應該幫它搭配的是灰色系的窗簾，且有幫助入眠的效果。

這簡單的例子，就能告訴我們其實[窗簾](https://trade.1111.com.tw/web/0422472216/)的重要性，窗簾是有影響到我們生活的可能性。
