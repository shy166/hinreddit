fsn9hj,Rankith,"Looking for a comprehensive overview of Sanders vs Biden ""electability""","Hey guys, I'm trying to find a nice detailed article or even reddit post that goes over why Biden is NOT more likely to beat Trump then Sanders.  Something that shows the common ""he gets important republican crossover votes"" narrative is completely baseless and does a more in depth look at all the other issues as well:

* Going over polling data that shows them as pretty close to even
* Looking at past elections and how poorly they go for centerist democrats
* Comparing votes based on issues (such as trade) and how Biden matches up poorly vs Trump
* Looking at the enthusiasm polling data and how low it is
* Talking about Trump being scared of Sanders as VP in 2016
* Sander's response and actions during this current crisis vs Biden's complete lack
* Biden's creeping on women and the new(ish) sexual assault allegation
* Biden's spouting of complete nonsense and loss of coherence at times
* Biden's terrible voting record and lack of resonance with Democratic voters in general

The above is just a list of things that said article might go over.  I have found individual articles/posts about those things, but I'm looking for a nice comprehensive one that essentially takes this whole concept down from every angle.

I'd maybe put one together myself but I am not great at that kind of thing and I am nearly positive there has to be something like this out there already and I have just not found it.

Thanks for any references you can point me to!",15,1585694982,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fsn9hj/looking_for_a_comprehensive_overview_of_sanders/,OurPresident,4
fsn5ye,CelloPietro,Joe's Cognitive Decline vs Bernie's Response,"Now this might sound a little like angry venting but hear me out. Let me start by saying that I love Bernie Sanders and everything he stands for with all my heart. He's one of the very few people that give me hope that this world is still worth living in.

But, every time I see a post/video showcasing how senile and incoherent Joe Biden currently is, my stomach literally turns thinking back to their last debate. Yeah I know that the entire thing was completely stacked against Bernie, and we had a few gotcha moments, but I FAIL to understand how we could not manage to highlight how mentally unfit Joe is for literally anything, let alone presidency.

Regardless of other aspects of the debate, that one aspect didn't come through nearly enough and it was the ONLY aspect that needed to. That's what had to be shown to the world. I get Bernie wanting to yet again reiterate his agenda, specially with the virus stuff going around. But that's exactly it. We already know his agenda. We here love it, other people hate it. Repeating it one more time at the debate is not gonna change that!

And as stalwart as Bernie has been in all these years I've known him, I can't help but attribute him fault at that one moment for not focusing on what imo should've been the top priority and possibly one of the very few things that could've turned this election around.

Cause in the end of the day, all these videos we post simply go unseen/ignored by the people who should be seeing them. But you can bet a good amount of those people were tuned in to see Joe at the debate.",9,1585694658,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fsn5ye/joes_cognitive_decline_vs_bernies_response/,OurPresident,2

fsk39m,InattentiveCup,"Real talk, this sub is getting to T_D levels of bad.","So I feel I have to tell everyone I've been a Bernie supporter since 2016 because otherwise people will come at me for saying this. This sub has gotten bad. Real bad. To the point that I had to stop coming here because it reminds me too much of T_D. It seems that Biden is the apperant Democratic nominee and I'm not going to focus on how this sub has been attacking the man but rather how you guys have reacted to him. When Biden won Super Tuesday you had posts here more or less saying that African Americans were voting for Biden because they were less educated/ intelligent. WTF?!? While Bernie bros really aren't a thing this sub can be, has been, and continues to be pretty rabid to anyone who even hints that they will vote biden in the Primary. You have comments saying that they HOPE Trump wins again so this country, in their mind, falls apart? Do you people realize that the general populous aren't as politically involved or fanatic as you? Maybe they want Biden BECAUSE he's running on an agenda of a return to normalcy. How can you not see how that would appeal to most people? Sure, you aren't getting these sweeping changes that we all hope for but at least you have the Democratic platform moving into the right direction albeit slowly. Rant over.

fsjyi8,Sambiswas95,"Please Spread the Word, and Stop The Candidate Who is No better than Trump.","There is the recent news of the sexual accusation of Joe Biden from his former female member, Tara Reade. Almost none of the media ever made a single coverage of her report. So I urge you guys to spread the word. And especially on Bernie Sanders, because I'm worried if Biden wins the nomination and more American people began to know of his past actions. I worried this year might be a repeat of the 2016 elections.

fsjn50,JarethKingofGoblins,I think we need to approach this phase of the campaign with more empathy. We need to separate two things: 1) the corrupt DNC and 2) the unwell former VP,"I know this community is passionate about Bernie Sanders. He's the only candidate I can bring myself to vote for at this stage, and I imagine a lot of you feel the same way. The corruption around the DNC, the primaries, and the debates is undeniable. It's worth us fighting against. Hard.

I also believe that the opponent Bernie faces is unwell. We're making a lot of posts pointing to potential dementia, and after hearing Biden talk, it's hard not to draw that conclusion. I think we can call attention to this issue in a way that is also empathetic. We're not the Trumpets. We should aspire to be better than that.

Imagine that your grandparent was in the early phases of dementia. However surrounded by corruption, however corrupt he is himself, he's still a person. The way the DNC is propping him up is criminal, but I think we should be careful to separate our righteous railing against corrupt media and DNC establishments from how we treat this sick person.",2,1585683459,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fsjn50/i_think_we_need_to_approach_this_phase_of_the/,OurPresident,5

fscwj1,saminfujisawa,Only Biden can beat Trump...,"...is the only message corporate media is pushing to their 60+ audience.

Biden has all of the corporate media outlets pushing him and bashing Bernie. There should be no confusion as to why Bernie is doing poorly with the primary corporate media demographic. 

Their viewers fear Trump, the corporate media is telling them 24/7 that **only** Biden can beat Trump. It is that simple.

This isn't new, but we have a serious issue with the way our public discourse is controlled by these corporate gatekeepers. How do we break that? How do we convince people that corporate media is just as big a problem regardless if it is FOX or CNN or MSNBC (owned by Comcast, Comcast CEO is one of Biden's biggest fundraisers).

Corporate media are not friendly, unbiased, neutral actors. They are mega corporations that don't want to pay taxes. 90% of US media (news, tv, cartoons, movies, music, radio, newspaper, magazines, etc.) is owned by four corporations. They want to keep Trump's tax cuts just as much as the DNC donors do.

Why do we act like this is Bernie vs Biden? It is Bernie vs the DNC and corporate media. Everyday people turn to ""the trusted names for news"" to get informed. But they are all being misled. Are we to expect these corporate media outlets to inform their viewers of their own conflicts of interest?",5,1585661296,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fscwj1/only_biden_can_beat_trump/,OurPresident,1

fscl1x,kareem_burner,"Debunking the Symone Sanders ""Tweet Delete Scandal""","So you've probably heard claims that Biden's press secretary, Symone Sanders, recently deleted her tweets that mention Kavanaugh or Christine Blasey Ford. I believe there are reasons to be skeptical about this.

First, it turns out that Sanders actually [deleted all of her tweets from before January 2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=(from%3ASymoneDSanders)%20until%3A2019-01-01&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live), not just the ones about Kavanaugh or Ford, so claiming that she's only deleting specific tweets is false.

Second, those tweets were almost certainly deleted sometime in July or August of 2019, since her account went from having over [11,000 tweets on July 17](https://web.archive.org/web/20190717214938/twitter.com/SymoneDSanders) to less than [1,500 by August 4](https://web.archive.org/web/20190804142202/https://twitter.com/SymoneDSanders).

Before now nobody really had a reason to pore over Sander's Twitter history, so it makes sense that the deleted tweets were only noticed now.  

I've seen comments calling Symone Sanders ""morally bankrupt"", a ""piece of shit human being"", and a ""rape apologist"". Considering that she herself is a survivor of sexual assault, I think this is extremely unfair to her.

fs5irm,atticus713,I supported Andrew Yang for president. Now I support Bernie Sanders,"I was a supporter of Andrew Yang ever since I read his book last December. But I've finally come to the realization that Bernie Sanders is the best person running to lead the world forward. I still believe that universal basic income is the difinitive solution to abolishing poverty. However, Yang's flip flop on m4a, weak foreign policy, and a general distrust in him to stay anti-war has flipped me to the Bern side. How should I go about making this transition? How do I support Bernie and his movement? Where should I start? Keep in mind, I've been a socialist since I was a young boy reading Kurt Vonnegut books. You don't need to convince me that leftist policy works.

I'll go backstage before a show, and everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else. ...You know, no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant.

frp168,nicolakirwan,Don't Let the Reade Story Blow Over," 

\[**Puts JD cap on**\] Regarding Tara Reade--an innocent person accused of sexual assault would probably file a lawsuit in civil court for defamation of character, including both libel and slander.  Both require malicious intent, which a false allegation of this nature would inherently have, especially if the assumption is that the accusation was fabricated in order to damage Biden's presidential campaign.  

Since Reade has identified individuals who corroborate her story and are willing to talk, you would then subpoena Reade's brother and fellow staffer to testify in court under penalty of perjury that she did in fact (or did not) tell them this story in 1993 and that they did in fact (or did not) discourage her from reporting it to the police.  Unlikely they would perjure themselves for her...unless they too are deep-planted Russian agents!  If they deny the story under oath, you're clear.  

A civil suit against Reade would be a straightforward way to put this accusation to rest--*but only if you were innocent*.

If you weren't innocent, then you wouldn't risk perjuring yourself in court or having Reade's brother and fellow staffer testify that she did in fact, tell them this happened in 1993 and that they were the reason she didn't go to the police.  You wouldn't risk that at all.  Instead you, the accused, would avoid saying anything about it, so as to neither incriminate yourself nor to be shown to be lying.  You'd also not want to leave yourself vulnerable to a defamation suit filed by your accuser, should you tell the public (falsely) that she is lying.  Your campaign (not you) would issue a blanket denial.  You'd wait for it to blow over.  You might also prepare in advance for this eventuality and hire someone you knew had experience dealing with such issues.  

Given that Reade began speaking about this incident last April, the Biden camp knew this was coming.  That's very possibly why Harvey Weinstein's PR consultant, Anita Dunn, is running the campaign.  Makes you wonder if there are more skeletons hiding in the closet.  

*I actually haven't been a big MeToo supporter; however, I don't think people should let this blow over.  It's obviously a calculated strategy to deflect and bury a credible claim of assault by a former employee.  Sexual harassment is one thing, but there is no way you allow a sexual assault allegation to make its way into Newsweek, HuffPo and The Guardian without coming out clearly and vehemently, in your own voice, to assure the public of your innocence.  The campaign's ""look into it yourself"" statement doesn't make sense given the seriousness of the charge and the fact that only Biden and Reade know for a fact what happened.  The campaign counted on people discrediting Reade personally and calculated that people would be so preoccupied with various elements of Reade's background that they wouldn't notice Biden's silence.*

frjuog,Horsyfuzzy,Guerilla campaign by US: internet flashmob?,"Hey everyone! I already posted about this on the general Bernie sub but I wanted to hear from this community too.

What if we all tweeted a Bernie ad with a specific hashtag at the exact same time? Force it to go viral.

What if we did something similar on other platforms such as intagram? What about something less conventional...what if we all uploaded the same video to pornhub (lol)?

Or maybe instead of the Bernie Ad, something less conventional? Like an attack on biden... an easy to watch 20 second video of Biden saying something scandalous (we all know he's  had his racist/creepy/controversial moments)

It would sort of create a viral scandal, right?

If just half this sub commited to it and all tweeted at once, it could be huge, right?

Tell me your thoughts and thanks for listening!

fr32xq,JerTheUnbidden,All of the doctors and nurses and hospital employees who are in debt today are saving the country and killing themselves to do so. They deserve to not be in debt for becoming such heroes.,"It's insane that they're the people who care for our physical health and most of these workers are in debt to their schools for insane amounts of money. If the case for canceling student debt was shaky before (it wasn't), then it certainly is a hell of a case now considering without them we'd all be fucked. 

I work in a manufacturing plant in Illinois near Chicago (still going to work, for some reason), and I don't have health insurance. But in the case that I got sick, it's one of these people who would be there taking care of me at potentially huge personal risk.

Keep fighting, everyone. Biden is being shook loose and he doesn't deserve the nomination. We aren't done yet.

fqypj3,lefoss,"If the sexual assault claims against Biden are going to be taken seriously, this isn’t the place to promote awareness.","This is a pro-Sanders subreddit. Not a sexual assault subreddit or even general politics or American life or culture. This story has nothing to do with Bernie. We may feel like we are helping Tara Reade by promoting her story, but we are hurting both her credibility and Bernie’s reputation by rallying to her claim in this forum.

Continually promoting the story here in post after post makes it feel a lot like we only care that she was assaulted because it makes Sanders the nominee if Biden drops out. Winning by default is not something to be proud of and it does nothing to convince the American people of the progressive agenda that Bernie wants for all of us. We haven’t lost the primaries yet. A slim chance is still a chance, and the global crisis is making it more clear than ever that we need Medicare for All and other social safety nets. We don’t need Biden to drop out to win, and Biden dripping out is not the right reason to care about sexual assault.

Most importantly, we need to give Tara the appropriate respect she deserves as a victim and support her in forums that are not tied to our political views. Justice for Tara Reade has absolutely zero to do with Bernie and our campaign, and I am ashamed of my fellow progressives trying to make political gain from a woman’s trauma.

I fully expect a ton of downvotes and no change, but if you disagree with what I’m saying then I don’t really want to be your friend so it’s ok. If you really care about this woman’s wellbeing then please help to get her story out, but for the love of all that is good in the world stop trying to make it about scheming to get our candidate into the White House.",19,1585451396,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fqypj3/if_the_sexual_assault_claims_against_biden_are/,OurPresident,1

The post was deleted by mods within 1 second. AKA they auto ban your posts on that sub for even mentioning certain words. Something, something freedom of speech?"," 

I'm not going to argue whether he did or didn't.

I'm a Bernie supporter from Canada but I would still support Biden if he were to win. I like both men as candidates and they both have progressive campaigns which is what USA needs. The only real difference is Biden's plan is less progressive but more likely to actually happen. Win-Win in my view and both look great against Trump.

Obviously the #1 priority for America and the rest of the world is to get Trump out of the White House so honestly whoever can get the job done, I support. My experience on this sub and the Bernie sub is support for the candidate to the point that it's pathetic. Bernie and Biden supporters both often ignore any flaw. Bernie repeats the same points without explaining them differently. Biden has an unacceptable amount of gaffes when he speaks. Regardless both seem to be good candidates.

So I'm curious, if Biden was guilty, would you still pick him over Bernie? Also would you still pick him over Trump?

Personally I'd lockdown with Bernie but if it was Biden vs Trump, I'd still sadly pick Biden and hope he had learned from his past. Thoughts?",14,1585447229,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fqxn9a/i_asked_if_biden_supporters_would_still_support/,OurPresident,1

fqtxjs,Capcombric,Democrats should push Joe Biden out of the presidential race the same way they pushed Al Franken out of office.,"I'm not really a Bernie supporter (I'm not even a Democrat), but I've tried to post this on multiple other subs and it's been removed, so I'm posting here since I think it needs to be discussed. There are multiple reasons why I think this is the right move.

(1) It would show they mean what they say about supporting women -- we all know they don't want Bernie, but if they don't want him so bad they'll let a sexual predator be the nominee instead, all their rhetoric about supporting victims was just that -- rhetoric.

(2) It's just the right thing to do. Tara Reade came forward because she doesn't want powerful people to get away with these sort of acts and not he held to account. She tried to come forward earlier, when it would have had a bigger impact on his presidential bid, but the Time's Up legal defense fund (which is run by a Biden staffer) blockaded her. The way to give her Justice is to force Joe Biden out of the race.

(3) If Biden wins the nomination under these circumstances, he will lose to Trump. There is little doubt of this. We can't run a sexual predator against Trump and expect to win. And we can't let him win a second term.

(4) The party leadership coalescing and urging Biden to drop out is the only way he's realistically likely to do so.",4,1585433922,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fqtxjs/democrats_should_push_joe_biden_out_of_the/,OurPresident,20

fqg6ec,NystromVatten,"Genuine doubts about Bernie and the coronavirus stimulus, from someone who really likes Bernie.","Like I said, longtime fan. But as important as supporting people you admire is, it’s equally valid to have doubts and to talk about those.

For me, it’s the coronavirus stimulus bill. Bernie hit it big on reddit the last few days with the speech he gave for it, and everyone talking about how much better he made it for Americans. I don’t doubt that he improved it, and that he fought for those improvements.

The huge problem with this bill though, is that it completely leaves out any 19-24 year olds who were claimed as dependents in the last tax season. If you were claimed, you get no check. Nothing, and your parents don’t get the $500 either.

This age group is possibly that which needs it most, being swamped in expenses and having some of the lowest income. Sure, some of the people being skipped are genuinely being supported at home. But a lot of us? A lot of us are paying most are bills, just using our parents’ home for a bed. A lot of us are being claimed as dependents because it makes loans and financial aid easier. A lot of us just have parents who do it without asking. And in spite of all of this, and how much of a kick to the gut this “stimulus” is to us in this time of crisis, I watched as the bill was praises to the rooftops.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m absolutely happy for everyone this bill helps. I am. You guys get that money, enjoy it, and keep on social distancing. But as for me? I’m stuck home, my hours reduced to zero, trying to pinch pennies and figure out how I’m going to pay bills if this crisis continues for another month. 

Maybe Bernie really did drastically improve the bill, If so, please let me know how. I’d love to hear about it. But for now it seems like we saw our guy give a passionate speech, saw something else happen, and then tied his speech to it without giving it much thought.  

Unrelated, but just wanted to get it off my chest.

Corporate bailouts were ridiculous. If you want to be treated like a person legally, how are you gonna turn around and collect more than your fair $1200 smh.

fqaere,Monoby,"To those who think Bernie has been treated fairly throughout this primary,","The media has been downplaying every Sanders win since he started the primary.   Joe Biden won SC which was expected and the media used that to prop him up as a comeback underdog. It worked. People eat that shit up. Biden won in states he barely spent money on and was given so damn much media coverage after his SC win.

Funny how the gay progressive candidate Pete endorses the complete opposite of a progressive along with Amy K RIGHT BEFORE SUPER TUESDAY.

Media isn’t talking about Biden’s fuck-ups, or his encounter with the union worker, or his other encounter with the veteran who rightfully yelled at him for being pro-Iraq war. DNC. The media is the establishment. It truly was always going to be difficult, but man, I didn’t expect this. Remember “Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids!”. Never aired again. 

There was already a study recently about the media and their reporting on the candidates. Bernie was reported 3x more negatively. Anyone who watches MSNBC, Fox, CNN, will see the blatant bias in the questions and reporting being done. Bernie was not given as much coverage and when he was it was fucking nothing but negative.

Bernie interviews are flat out blood-boiling. Biden is hidin’ from the media or given soft-ball questions, which he still fucks up, as he just said the other day he would veto a M4A bill. Something the majority of voters have already demonstrated as something they wanted in NUMEROUS POLLS! They never spoke about it again.

They don’t know Biden says this shit, or has had a history of cutting social security, has a history of pro-segregation, his son was discharged from the Navy for cocaine, numerous child touching videos, slept with his dead brothers wife, and has dementia level fuck ups every five minutes, because the media doesn’t fucking cover it. Not at all or not barely enough. You know who will cover it though? Trump. The right is going to have a field day with this shit, and Biden is going to be eaten alive in November. The Nazi flag at one of Sanders’ rally was BARELY spoken about!  So there. Calling it a tin-foil conspiracy is plain fucking wrong, and just shows how well all of this shit worked. Don’t be a goddamn sheep.

If you think Big Pharma, the media, the fossil fuel industry, the 1%, Bloomberg, and the right didn’t do everything in their power to hurt Bernies chances of winning, you’re a complete fool. The headline during the last debate was “Political Revolution vs Fixing the system” Are you fucking kidding me?

The Sanders campaign pleaded to postpone the election last time for coronavirus but the DNC declined and actually threatened to take delegates away as a penalty for states that did postpone. The DNC did that, and Rachel Maddow goes on CNN saying Bernie is getting people sick, putting people at risk, is being immoral by not dropping out and forcing people to vote. Holy fuck.

I’m trying to understand what Trump specifically did wrong with respect to his response to Coronavirus. I get that there were a lot of mistakes on many levels but what did he specifically do wrong? what measures could he have taken that he didnt take? 

The whole Covid testing kit debacle have nothing to do with anything he could have done as president. he took precautions way before europe. i've read nothing about people being kept from developing their own tests. Down playing the virus is what everyone in the world did for about 2 months. Every article I’ve read is mostly dealing in people's opinions that aren't based on any concrete things that he did that were misteps.

fps7h5,EuropeRoTMG,I'm with you /u/TJames6210. Max allowable donation for Bernie!,"https://imgur.com/a/pRidaS0

I grew up in section 8 housing, a poor minority living off government handouts. I never saw my parents because they were always working to afford rent. I worked hard, studied in college, and eventually was blessed with a well paying job. People love to say that's *pulling yourself up by the bootstraps* but luck had everything to do with it. There are many families being raised by a single parent, who don't have a father/mother figure. There are many parents right now who are jobless due to this terrible virus. There are people who are drowining in medical debt with no fault other than their own genetics. Poor and struggling people should never be vilified. Bernie Sanders is the only genuine politician who's kept the same progressive ideas his entire life. He is not afraid of the greedy establishment, his opinions do not come from polls, and he has never been a hypocrite. Regardless of the outcome, my money did not go to waste. My donation has given Bernie more freedom to broadcast his message of *Not me. Us* to the mainstream dialog.

I hope that one day my taxes goes to lift up people less fortunate than me, on ALL sides of the political spectrum, rather than paying for bombs to blow up the middle east.

fpisyc,PM_ME_INSANE_FACTS,Former Sanders supporter with honest question,"I was pro-Sanders in 2016, voted for Hillary in the general. This time, I started off as a Yang supporter before kind of becoming homeless in terms of candidates. I will vote for Biden in the general, given my belief that Trump is awful and after having discussions with my friends who have families that are directly affected by Trump's policies.

I see a lot of people here saying that they'll either vote third party or vote for Trump under the impression that 2024 will be Bernie's/the progressives' year. However, given that Bernie has now effectively lost two presidential nomination contests (I know he could \*technically\* win this one, but it's an extremely uphill battle), what makes you believe that 2024 will be his/their year? Yes, a majority support his positions, but they either didn't vote or didn't vote in large enough numbers to win (or voted for a different candidate).

I understand that some will come at this post with accusations of vote rigging, media censorship, cognitive decline, and, likely, the recent rape allegations. I personally haven't seen any convincing arguments regarding rigging and censorship. The mental decline things is also something that no medical professionals (to my knowledge) have supported. I am following the Reade story to see how it develops and will alter my views accordingly, but that doesn't have a lot to do with my question (I guess you could say that a proven rape would encourage progressives to vote against the establishment in 2024, but that's not a guarantee as people may still vote for a moderate).

So, if we could avoid those points and stick to why 2024 will be his/their year based on turnout and the issues, I would greatly appreciate it. Otherwise, I think it's difficult to make the argument to either vote third party or vote for Trump.",26,1585253888,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fpisyc/former_sanders_supporter_with_honest_question/,OurPresident,1

Not just because of his stance on Israel and climate change, I believe intelligent, hard-working, uncompromising and kind-hearted people like him should be the leader of every country. Through online political discussions, I eventually became more interested in U.S. politics than politics in my own country. 

People in my life are constantly asking me why I don't give the same amount of attention to Israeli politics. That kind of talk only motivates me more, but aside from Twitter stuff and phonebanking (which is hard to do considering calling hours are very late at night in Israeli time) I can't do much. I'm wondering if I can do more, organize something in Israel that can help Bernie win. I have no knowledge on how to do stuff like that, but I can research and try.

*Text Intro:  Tara Reade has been trying to tell her story since it happened in 1993, when she was working as a staff assistant for Joe Biden. She told part of her story-- about how Biden would put his hands on her shoulders and run his fingers up and down her neck-- in the spring of 2019 after Lucy Flores accused Biden of kissing the top of her head and smelling her hair inappropriately. But Reade didn't tell her full story. As Ryan Grim reveals at The Intercept, Reade asked for help from Time's Up, but the organization said it could not support her because a case taking on Biden would jeopardize their non-profit status. Tara is finally telling the story she's been trying to tell for decades. While there were no witnesses to Biden's alleged sexual assault of Tara Reade, her brother and close friend, both of whom I've spoken to, recall Reade telling them about it at the time. The rest of the interview will be released shortly.* 

Katie Halper: Hello and welcome to the Katie Halper show I'm about to play an excerpt from an interview that I did with Tara Reade. The full episode will be up shortly. As a warning, Tara discusses sexual assault during this interview. 

Tara was one of eight women to accuse Joe Biden of some form of inappropriate touching last spring after Nevada politician Lucy Flores alleged that the vice president inappropriately touched her during her run for congress. Tara told journalists that in 1993 when she was a staff assistant to then senator Biden, he put his hands on her shoulders and rubbed his fingers up and down her neck. But Tara says there's more to her story and she considered telling it last spring, but after coming forward and being smeared as a Russian agent and being doxed, she did not. We now know from Ryan Grim at 324 article on The Intercept, Tara did try to come forward once again in January of 2020.

Tara turned to Times Up, the non-profit dedicated to helping women in the post me-too world tell their story. But Times Up, Ryan Grim reports, was concerned such a political story involving a potential presidential candidate could affect their non-profit status. So here Tara finally tells the rest of the story that she hasn't been able to tell in the past. Not surprisingly, there are no witnesses to Tara's story of alleged assault, but Tara's brother and Tara's close friend, both of whom I spoke to recalled Tara telling them about the incident at the time.

Here is an excerpt. I'll be releasing the full interview shortly. And this opens with Tara describing a superior calling her into her office to ask her to do an errand. So she says that she...

Tara Reade:  Called me in and said, ""I want you to take this to Joe. He wants it. He wants you to bring it. Hurry. And I said, ""Okay."" And it was a gym bag. She said, you know, take the gym bag. She called it an 'athletic bag'. And you know she said he was down towards the Capitol and he'll meet you. And so I went down, and I was heading down towards there and he was at first talking to someone. I could see him at a distance and they went away and then um we were in like the side. It was like the side area. And um he just said ""Hey, come here Tara and then I handed him the thing and he greeted me. He remembered my name. And then we were alone, and it was the strangest thing. There was no like exchange really. He just had me up against the wall. And um I was wearing a skirt. You know a business skirt, but I wasn't wearing stockings. It was kind of a hot day that day, and I was wearing heels. And I remember my legs had been hurting from the marble, you know of the Capitol. And so I remember that kind of stuff. I remember like I was wearing a blouse and he just had me up against the wall, and the wall was cold. And I remember he- it happened all at once. The gym bag - I don't know where it went. I handed it to him and it was gone. And then his hands were on me and underneath my clothes. And um yeah and then he went um.. he went down my skirt and up inside it and he uh penetrated me with his fingers. And um I- uh he was kissing me at the same time, and he was saying something to me. He was saying several things, and I can't remember everything he said. I remember a couple of things. I remember him saying first like as he was doing it, ""Do you wanna go somewhere else? And then him saying to me when I pulled away he um got finished doing what he was doing and I kind of was pulled back and he said, ""Come on, man. I heard you liked me."" And that phrase stayed with me because I kept thinking what I might've said, and I can't remember exactly if he said ""I thought"" or if ""I heard"" but it's like he like that I had done this. Like I don't know, and for me it was like everything shattered in that moment, because I knew like we were alone and it was over, right? He wasn't trying to do anything more, but I looked up to him. He was like my father's age. He was this champion of women's rights in my eyes, and I couldn't believe it was happening. It seemed surreal. And I knew I just felt sick because when I pulled back, he looked annoyed and he said um something else to me that I don't want to say. And then he said- I must have looked shocked. And then he grabbed by the shoulders. I don't know how I looked, but I must have looked something, because he grabbed me by the shoulders and he said ""You're okay you're fine. You're okay you're fine."" And then he walked away and he went on with his day and what I remember next was being in the Russell building like where the big windows are in the stairs by myself, and my body - I was shaking everywhere because it was cold all of the sudden. I don't know - I just felt like I was shaking- just everywhere, and I was trying to grasp what just happened and what I should do or what I should say. But I knew it was bad because he was so angry. Like when he left, I could feel, you know how when you know someone's angry they don't necessarily have to say anything. Like he smiles when he's angry and you can just feel it emanating from him. 

Katie Halper: Do you want to share that thing, like you said ""I don't wanna say what he said. That thing he said to you."" 

Tara Reade: Um. Yeah I guess I could. 

Katie Halper: I mean you don't have to 

Tara Reade: It's okay. It's just um. It's almost like giving a weapon to them. 

Katie Halper: How so?

Tara Reade: Well, it's like, I don't want them to know how much it hurt. I don't know. I don't what him to know...

Katie Halper: That like - that you remembered it?

Tara Reade: Yeah just I don't know- But yeah I can say it. Um. Yeah there's something he said that I didn't want to say, and I didn't want to say it because it's the thing that stays in my head over and over like. And um it's the thing that kind of stayed with me over the years. But he said, um. When he had me against the wall after he had done- after I pulled away and he said, ""Hey"" you know ""Come on, I heard you liked me."" And I um knew he was angry right after he took his finger. He just like pointed at me and he said ""You're nothing to me."" And he just looked at me and goes, ""You're nothing. Nothing."" And then I must've reacted. And I think he only said it twice. But I just heard the word 'nothing'. And I must've reacted because that's when he took me by the shoulders and he said, you know, ""You're okay. You're fine. You're okay."" But then afterwards like it kept replaying in my head and like last April when all that stuff came out, I got really really sad about it. And the thing that I remember most- almost more than the assault itself, was that I was nothing. And he was right. That's how people treated me. That's how the whole office treated me. And I have no platform. I am no one. And to him I'm nothing. So yeah. Um. So people want to know why women don't come forward, that's a good example why.

Legislative Senate votes since Impeachment (02/10/2020):

(I did not include any nomination votes)

02/13/2020 - S J Res 68 - Sen Sanders Voted YES (Passed 55-45)

02/25/2020 - S 3275 - Cloture Vote (60 needed) - Did Not Vote (Failed 53-44)

02/25/2020 - S 311 - Cloture Vote (60 needed) - Did Not Vote (Failed 56-41)

03/05/2020 - HR 6074 - Sen Sanders not present - (Passed 96-1)

03/11/2020 - H J Res 76 - Sen Sanders not present - (Passed 53-42)

03/18/2020 - HR 6201 - Sen Sanders Voted Yes (Passed 90-8)

03/22/2020 - HR 748 - Cloture Vote (60 needed) - Did Not Vote (Failed 47-47)

03/23/2020 - HR 748 - Cloture Vote (60 needed) - Was Present - Voted No (Failed 49-46)

If you want to check my work:

https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/vote_menu_116_2.htm

Cloture Votes don’t pass unless there are 60 votes. Schumer would tell Sen Sanders if he needed him for cloture defense but I can’t see any situation where his vote would be needed.

The questionable ""Not Present” vote is HJ Res 76 until I read the bill:

H.J.Res.76 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to ""Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability”

Unless I’m misinformed, it appears that was a non-binding “disapproval” vote.

I don’t think I’d have any issue with this voting record no matter who the senator is.

fo40vu,orangge-it,An interesting thought train,"So my dad said he wants to keep the money he earns(fair enough)

We also agree higher learning should be affordable 

Now for the thought train

If college is more affordable more people can go

If more people go more people can graduate with college degrees 

If college degrees help get better paying jobs fewer people will need social security 

If fewer people need social security then less money is needed then tax rates might go down

If tax rates go down then you keep more of your money

Another chain of effect with affordable college 

More people go to go college 

More people can become doctors 

More doctors can treat people 

More people getting treated 

Shorter wait times for operations 

Meaning the argument of national healthcare leads to longer wait times becomes flawed

fnzc51,Kittyvvarbastet,I fear Joe Biden is a victim of elder abuse being forced to run.,"I never liked Biden's policies although I am concerned for his well being. He obviously had a severe stroke likely because Joe Biden just hasn't aged as well as Bernie Sanders health wise, I am not saying this to be mean.

Biden is obviously deep in his twilight years, and like every individual who succumbs to age related dementia, he should live the rest of his years with as much peace, happiness and with as low stress as possible. Pushing Joe Biden to be president is frankly elderly abuse. I firmly believe he is being abused and taken advantage of, and that we should investigate the individuals responsible pushing him so hard to become president.

As much as I despise his policies, I do believe Joe Biden is a suffering senile old man who needs our help and compassion. I am not saying he is too old to be president I am however saying age related mental problems have made him unfit.

I almost suspect Biden actually deep down inside may be feeling doubt. But he is being pressured so hard now.

We need Bernie Sanders to fix the world... And Biden in his current state I fear would not be able to handle being president. It's not just that I disagree with him, I genuinely fear he is being abused by his ""supporters"". I genuinely fear it is very cruel to socially pressure Joe Biden to continue to run for president.

Joe Biden doesn't need political supporters right now, he needs compassion and understanding, he should be allowed to step down without being shamed for it. He didn't choose to suffer dementia from a brain injury, doesn't mean he is weak or bad, but it does mean it's extremely cruel to pressure him to run for POTUS.",11,1585026099,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fnzc51/i_fear_joe_biden_is_a_victim_of_elder_abuse_being/,OurPresident,1

fn74w4,rolyataylor2,"Is it time to unionize? Can we, the average worker, change the dynamic in the job market?","Right now the rich are weak and the people are strong.

I have no experience creating a union but I would say that right now is a time to form a huge union of retail workers and demand higher wages, benefits and more respect.

Here is a quote from the [NLRB.gov](https://NLRB.gov) page:

&gt;If a majority of workers wants to form a union, they can select a union in one of two ways: If at least 30% of workers sign cards or a petition saying they want a union, the NLRB will conduct an election. If a majority of those who vote choose the union, the NLRB will certify the union as your representative for collective bargaining. An election is not the only way a union can become your representative. Your employer may voluntarily recognize a union based on evidence - typically signed union-authorization cards - that a majority of employees want it to represent them. Once a union has been certified or recognized, the employer is required to bargain over your terms and conditions of employment with your union representative. Special rules apply in the construction industry.

We just need to form the union and get people who are willing to sign up. Then we just need to learn how to be ruthless and cutthroat and demand lower pay for CEO's and Profit sharing. Right now companies will have to choose between going bankrupt or caving to demands.",3,1584910856,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fn74w4/is_it_time_to_unionize_can_we_the_average_worker/,OurPresident,1

We use his base, the now unemployed low-risk millions of young people, to fill personnel needs.

He coordinates a campaign that combines the power of all his celebrities and musicians. Has them all release the same video at the same time, instant access to hundreds of millions for delivery of the message.

He then continues to use that media machine (which will be developed into a potential news organization) to provide morale and guidance to the American people, as a President would do.

As we defeat the virus with the forces that HE created, America begins to associate him with hope, strength, and victory.

He is guaranteed the Presidency because millions see him now as savior, and those who would still be in favor of the other candidates have either been hurt by their actions, or dead.

fkf9xt,gelbbear,"“Bernie won’t win anyways, so it's no use to vote.”","My response to this aggravating attitude:

This election is a rare opportunity for our government to experience fundamental changes that are long overdue. Each candidate’s campaign in the previous election cycles has been immensely funded by large donations from private companies, ultimately buying out each candidate. They have operated their presidencies by finding the perfect middle ground between appeasing their donors and their voters. 

Each of their campaigns and presidencies has been nothing but a show to entertain the American people with the illusion that our voices are being heard and that our demands are being acted on. In reality, our federal government has been completely commandeered by large corporations and our government is working to serve them. Red or blue, this is true. So each president has managed to do the bare minimum to please their voter base while still protecting and advocating for their donors’ interests. This explains that while corporations keep prospering, the American people struggle more each year. If you are in doubt of this claim, I encourage you to research the donors of, and laws enacted by each president. 

The systems of higher education and healthcare are two prime examples of industries that are blatantly exploiting Americans using this tactic. The fact that we allow and even justify the predatory and abusive healthcare system is an embarrassment to our nation. Americans spend more per capita on health care than any other developed country, yet the only thing we have to show for this is the flourishing insurance and healthcare corporations being funded by our sick and dying Americans. 

Joe Biden’s campaign has already received millions in donations from companies in the healthcare industry in addition to his other private interest donations. His presidency will be nothing more but another entertaining charade in which he does the bare minimum to please his voters while fundamentally being a puppet to serve corporate interests. 

Bernie is our only opportunity to fight with this and make actual changes, and he doesn’t have any corporations on his side to advocate for him. That’s why *your* vote matters more than ever. **There is no neutral ground- if you are not an active voter for Bernie, then you are a passive supporter of Biden.**",28,1584487126,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fkf9xt/bernie_wont_win_anyways_so_its_no_use_to_vote/,OurPresident,2

fkdpe3,Baloney-Os,r/SandersForPresident just makes me sad sometimes,"Posted this on r/SandersForPresident and it got removed. I feel pretty confused that the biggest Bernie sub just likes to cover their ears and say ""la-la-la can't hear you"", and it's certainly not what Bernie would do. This post doesn't apply much to this sub but I still wanted to share it because it's apparently censorship worthy on r/SandersForPresident.

&gt;*Title:* I'm in with Bernie till the end, but...  
&gt;  
&gt;Can we be even just a little less biased? When Bernie loses states we just get some cheer squad headlines like ""WE GONNA WIN THIS"" instead of being  updated with topics that share hard facts about losing a state. Why go so far to hide them? Can we really not handle news of losing states? Why sink to the level where you have to go to different places to look up unfavorable outcomes? Why sweep unfavorable outcomes under the rug while  at the same time embellish the victories?  
&gt;  
&gt;That  just hurts the movement and tbh looks like a strange form of denial. Meanwhile, people who are on the fence will catch these and leave with a bad taste in their mouth. It doesn't seem to be what Bernie himself represents at all, since he's constantly on the dot about presenting information factually and objectively.  
&gt;  
&gt;I believe that Bernie has a good chance of winning the election seeing how he's already won over the movement. Being more honest with ourselves will go a long way in not shooting ourselves in the foot, and IMO greatly increases the chances of gaining swing voters.",5,1584481330,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fkdpe3/rsandersforpresident_just_makes_me_sad_sometimes/,OurPresident,0

fkaua9,infps,"It is probably obvious and I am just slow, but reading AOC's twitter, I finally realized the DNC is two separate parties.","Basically, the DNC in 2020 is a conservative Christian dad whose having an affair on the downlow and a Mom that's pretty much done with it.  

They've tried to ""make it work for the kids"" for a few years now.

However, they're not happy, the kids ain't happy.  Nobody's happy.

It's definitely not ""the moderate end of the party,"" and ""the more radical end of the party.""  Make no mistake about it, Biden is running to appeal to Republicans who wish to heavens they could vote for a Paul Ryan or a Bob Dole instead of Trump.  He's basically a conservative moderate Republican.  The difference is, at least those guys have enough honesty to let you know what they are (and I would vote for either against Trump).

As Chomsky pointed out for decades, the traditional Democrat party are right-wing extremists by any sensible meaning of the political spectrum.

Meanwhile there's the actual liberal party: Bernie (not a Democrat, actually), AOC, Stacey Abrams, etc....

If the DNC succeeds in ramming through Joe Status Quo Lyin Biden, it is time for us to basically take our pieces and go somewhere else.   He will most likely elected if he gets the nomination, but he will never win through any action of mine.

I would have said ""I will vote for the lesser evil"" *if the republican party within the DNC had actually submitted a lesser evil to the contest.*

""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

fkafxk,_sablecat_,"If we always choose to vote for the ""Lesser Evil,"" then they've got no reason to stop giving us only evil choices.","Democratic party officials have outright stated that the reason they don't take us seriously, don't listen to our demands, is because they can expect us to vote for them anyways because at least they're not as bad as Republicans.

Every Republican candidate is some new, unique threat to all our institutions and way of life. Democrats told us how horrible _Bush_ was, he was the worst president ever, and how getting him out of office should supersede all other priorities, too. They promised to prosecute him for his crimes, too. Nowadays, they treat him like an old friend. And Trump hasn't even killed a million people like Bush did - you're delusional if you think they won't let him off the same way.

Trump isn't some unique threat to our democracy, he's just a slightly more vulgar and uncouth version of the average Republican president. Do not listen to centrists' entreaties that progressive policies will have to wait until the current crisis is over, because they've been saying that for 30 fucking years! You will always be waiting, you will never stop waiting, because according to these same people the crisis will never be over! Every election is it's own, brand new crisis, and we need to put aside our principals to solve it! No more!

Do not promise to ""Vote blue no matter who."" When you do that, you're promising them ""You can safely ignore me and my preferences because you'll get my vote no matter what."" Tell people you will only vote for Biden if he adopts a progressive policy platform and promises to appoint progressives to his cabinet. Show them _you_ can be a swing voter too.

I made the mistake of reluctantly supporting Hillary against Trump in 2016. Most of us did. What thanks did they give us? They blamed us for her loss. You will always be the scapegoat.

There will be riots, there will be bloodshed, because one way or another, monetary capitalism will be disintegrated. We can do it the easy way by having Sanders and taking things slowly down the path of democratic socialism, or we can jump right in with guillotines blazing.

fk1jim,TheCoolPersian,"Folks, I'm Going to Be Honest Here.","After seeing that debate Sunday night, and seeing all the bones Bernie was throwing Biden, and Biden just flat out didn't catch on, or willfully ignored them. I cannot stress enough how important it is for us to vote. I'm not as amazing as all the volunteers that go out there every day trying your best, to rally people together. But, if Bernie sticks in it for the New York Primary, I'd know my whole family and neighbors would go out to vote for him. The problem is getting there. Bernie put a lot of faith in us younger votes to turn out to vote for him, and some of us didn't go the extra mile to wait in line and vote. It is easier said than done, but if you didn't vote or don't vote, because you believe it doesn't matter. You're wrong, and you know this too, deep down.

I haven't caught up with which primaries will be still going on today, but I would expect some to be closed, or very few people will show up because of the virus. But for the lack of a better word, destiny has shown America how flawed our current healthcare system is. Biden is not even close to Bernie on many of these issues, and even if he beats Trump (which I doubt) we still won't get many key issues addressed. Our future depends on who is President, and if either Biden or Trump are President, I don't see much of a future for us. 

It is imperative that you go out and vote today. Make sure you are equipped to protect yourself against the spread of the virus. Take those necessary precautions and go out and vote. Have some friends or family that are registered to vote? Make sure they'll be safe too, and take them with you. If we can win today. We can win the Presidency.

fjwm69,YoloForJesusChrist,How do we feel about our president avoiding questions?,"I was uncomfortable watching the debate when Bernie was asked a direct question, and he just danced around it without giving an answer, similar to Hillary Clinton. 

For example, when he was asked about his lack of support from black voters, he mentioned young people, hispanic people, Donald Trump, but never mentioned the topic of the question: black voters. 

&gt;Ilia Calderón: (11:20)
Senator Sanders, let me just follow up with you about an issue that you’re having for the second consecutive presidential election. You’re struggling to gain wide support from African-Americans. Why is your message not resonating with African-American voters?

&gt;Bernie Sanders: (11:37)
Here is what I believe is happening and this is an important point and why I decided to run for president. I think it’s imperative that we defeat Trump. I think our campaign of a biracial, bigenerational, multigenerational grassroots movement is the way to do it. Now we have won some states, Joe has won more States than I have, but here’s what we are winning. We are winning the ideological struggle. Even in States like Mississippi where Joe won a major victory. It turns out that a pretty good majority of the folks there believe in Medicare for … and that’s true in almost every state in this country.

&gt;Bernie Sanders: (12:15)
And the other issue that we don’t talk enough about is we are winning the generational struggle. Depending on the state, we’re winning people 50 years of age or younger, big time people, 30 years of age and younger. I frankly have my doubts.

&gt;Bernie Sanders: (12:29)
Look, if I lose this thing, Joe wins, Joe, I will be there for you. But I have my doubts about how you win a general election against Trump will be a very, very tough opponent unless you have energy, excitement, the largest voter turnout in history. And to do that you are going to have to bring young people who are not great voters. They don’t vote in the kinds of numbers they should into the political process. You’re going to have to bring Latinos who are great people, have the agenda that we need, but also don’t vote in the numbers that we need. I have my doubts that vice president Biden’s campaign can generate that energy and excitement and that voter turnout.",9,1584408657,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fjwm69/how_do_we_feel_about_our_president_avoiding/,OurPresident,1

I’ll be blunt. If you’re a person who is particularly vulnerable to the corona virus, or are in constant contact with someone who is vulnerable, STAY HOME! Vote from home if you can. And, as much as we like to rag on boomers for not voting in anyone’s best interest, all of us have relatives in that age range. Parents and grandparents. They’re the ones most vulnerable and we should be doing everything we can to keep them away from crowded areas. That includes polling places. Thankfully some states have postponed their primaries. The states voting tomorrow, unfortunately, haven’t. This isn’t an easy choice. My grandparents are voting for Bernie, and I’ve asked them to stay home. If you’re in Florida, then the situation there might be particularly risky. Please do whatever you can to stay safe and keep your loved ones safe.

I get that people are critical of Biden, but that’s not the point of this subreddit as described in the sidebar. Today, the overwhelming majority of content on the front page of this subreddit are anti-Biden posts rather than Pro-Bernie posts. This subreddit is meant to be about making the strongest case for Bernie possible, but in the scenario he doesn’t win the primary it shouldn’t devolve into dragging down the candidate who more closely aligns with Bernie. Yet that is what it appears to be doing right now. Maybe it’s too early for this, but after Tuesday of Bernie no longer has a chance to win the primary I really hope we can reconcile our differences and focus on our similarities for the betterment of our country.

Anyway, that’s my 2 cents. Not looking to get heated here or fight over ideology. Just wanted to ask a question in good faith.",20,1584396869,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fjtkgm/has_this_subreddit_become_an_antibiden_subreddit/,OurPresident,3

I've noticed on the front page, I haven't ever seen a video on how to vote. Also, I think there's too little pride among young people voting.

fjibeg,WorriedOrchid,"If Bernie doesn’t win the primary election, you need to understand the consequences of not voting for Biden","*****DISCLAIMER BEFORE I CONTINUE**** I am saying IF Bernie doesn’t win, and this is **not** a pro-Biden post. 

But back to what I want to say:

If Bernie does not win the primary election, and you are part of the #BernieOrBust group so you abstain from voting completely in the general election, or if you write-in Bernie’s name, or if you vote for Trump, you are going *completely* against everything Bernie Sanders — and you — have been fighting for. 

By not voting for the democratic candidate, you are giving the republican incumbent a much higher chance at winning — especially if you choose to vote for him as well. 

This whole primary has been about the people, about a revolution, about fixing America and saving America. If we cannot do that this time around, the least we can do is some harm reduction. 

Harm reduction is a term that people in recovery from either addiction and/or eating disorders use when they’re not able to completely stop the harmful behaviors, so they find ways to reduce the harm and find safe ways. 

So in this case, Biden would be America’s harm reduction. 

If you abstain from voting, if you write-in Bernie’s name, is you vote for Trump, how can you say you truly believe in what Bernie and we all are fighting for? You are knowingly throwing away our chance at getting rid of one of, if the _the_ , most toxic and horrendous presidents in history. 

So please, please vote for the democratic candidate — whether it’s Bernie Sanders  or Joe Biden. 

If Trump’s response to this pandemic has shown us anything, it’s shown he will never care about _any_ American other than himself.",27,1584351347,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fjibeg/if_bernie_doesnt_win_the_primary_election_you/,OurPresident,1

fjh353,Suicyclone,If Bernie comes out behind this Tuesday...,"Tbh, I don't think the debate was enough to turn things around for this primary with how far Biden has pulled out ahead. Biden is projected to win all these states on Tuesday by a lot. The polls in Florida especially have been looking brutal. 

&amp;#x200B;

If Bernie Sanders loses this Tuesday I think he might drop out. If this happens where do we go from there? I'm not sure who the next progressive candidate will be that will run for president. Most of the people who we originally thought were progressive (Yang and Warren) turned out to not be as progressive as we thought so it's hard to tell who is progressive and who isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Also it seems that the deck is so far stacked against us that I'm not sure if it's possible for a progressive candidate to win. The primary was clearly rigged in 2016, and now were seeing some of it polling places closing down in poor areas and areas with a lot of minorities, suspicious activity going on in Iowa with Pete Buttigeig having ties to the app that failed, complete bias in the media, votes being lost in Texas, there being a huge discrepancy in exit polls and reported results, and all the moderates dropping out and endorsing Biden etc. etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If another progressive candidate does show up I'm not if it's even possible for them to get voted in with how rigged it has been.  Given all this if Bernie loses this what do we do next? Try to win the congress? Maybe try to look at a third party? Fall in line with the moderate democrats since they're the closes to us.

To start off I voted for Bernie in the primaries in Texas and have donated around 25 times via ActBlue. I really want Medicare For All and I also really want us to do all we can against global warming and to top it all off I don't like Biden in the slightest. The debate showed me today that he was just answering what he thought was right, lying left and right. He's just adding minor things to his so called platform to make it seem more progressive so that if he wins the nomination it'll be more inticing to the Warren/Bernie crowd.  I also understand and see all the shit the media/DNC are pulling to manipulate the votters and that both parties need to be either demolished or fundamentally changed. Now that being said, if Bernie doesn't win the nomination, why is not voting the correct thing to do? Is four more years of Trump better than four years of Biden? Please note that I'm not trolling, I was watching some debate threads and kept seeing people who were supposedly Bernie supporters saying BernieOrBust and I just want to understand why that's the way some people are going.

fjeozb,jinmori23,I'm Angry At Our Country's Government,"You know, I dont understand the hate, and lack of love that many Americans can exhibit. We see people struggling and suffering, yet the people in power do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to help the little men and women. The people who are quite literally the pillar which upholds this country. So many are struggling right now, but the banks get help instead?

Throughout this coronavirus pandemic, I have come across people online, and in real life, who are sick, and who show symptoms. Yet, these people are afraid to go to the doctor because they can't afford the care, or because they can't afford to stay away from work for 14 or so days. It saddens me that people can't go out and get help when they so desperately need it, because they are afraid of not being able to PAY for help. Let that sink in, PAY FOR HELP. Help to live and help to be healthy, something which should be considered a basic human right! This shouldn't be a choice. A choice to stay sick, spread the disease and, potentially, die, or stay and work because you cant afford care or time off. Healthcare should be available to any and all who needs it, free, or atleast, at a reasonable price.

It's sickening, appalling, and, downright, disgusting that there are people who oppose M4A. It makes no sense whatsoever to me. Why must we lock health behind a fortress and demand all who seeks healing, and help, to pay a toll? Pay a toll that literally cannot be paid in most cases.

P.S. This isnt just about the virus btw, this is about the whole system. It needs fixing, it needs change, we need someone with a heart and love for people.

He would also specifically prohibit cable providers from providing content, which is exactly why AT&amp;T is doing through CNN.

fjd96o,CelloPietro,Unpopular opinion: I don't think Bernie did enough on the debate to secure undecided voters.," I am a Bernie supporter through and through. I love the man and I love his policies. But that's precisely the problem - we need the people who don't love him to vote for him. And I don't think that those people were made informed enough or convinced enough by what Bernie laid out on the table tonight.

'I' know that Biden was lying through his fucking teeth like it didn't matter, ""Oh I was the first to do this, the first to do that. I invented electricity"" or whatever other bulshit he was spouting. But a lot of undecided people probably didn't know. 'I' know that saying ""Bernie you got 9 super PACs yourself!"" is the most ludicrous statement ever to come out of someone's mouth, but again lots of people don't have that knowledge. 'I' know that Bernie has laid out perfectly sensible and realistic ways to achieve his amazing goals. But you can't underestimate how uninformed and gullible people are these days.

You have to keep that in mind. Gotta look at it through the eyes of someone who hasn't been interested in Bernie until this point and hasn't cared to learn shit about his policies. And I feel like Bernie didn't REBUKE or CONTEST or CALL OUT Joe nearly enough on any of those times. He needed to state explicitly and categorically how incorrect Joe was and repeat as many times as needed with emphasis. I would've demanded he list the 9 super PACs he mentioned AT LEAST 50 more times.

Joe might've been as incoherent and rambly as usual to the informed viewer but that's the minority! He otherwise spoke with a strong tone and directly at the camera at lot more than Bernie.

I'm not trying to bring anybody down, just venting some frustration. Feel free to correct me, actually it'd probably make me feel better. Still hoping we come out on top of this.

fjczq9,TruthTold89,"Sadly, Bernie did not take on Joe Biden or the DNC for thier blatant corruption. And I fear, ensured that Joe will be the Nominee, and that Trump will win reelection hands down.... THIS IS WHAT WE CAN DO FROM HERE, FIGHT BACK!","Look, at the end of the day the truth is simple. **JOE BIDEN WILL LOSE TO TRUMP.** Now the only thing we can do is either sit back and do nothing, or start the necessary conversation about the inherent and abhorrent corruption that lives with the DNC. Because regardless of what we do Joe Biden will lose, and if we don't attack the MSM and the DNC now, come November 2020 they will have wall to wall coverage of how, ""Bernie Sanders and his supporters got Trump elected president AGAIN!""

No, fuck this! Not this time, I will not fall in line and not a damn rally or stupid speech will get me to do otherwise **Because people need to know why Jor Biden will lose and why he will have lost. And that is simply because of one reason, AMERICANS ARE SICK OF VOTING FOR CORRUPT POLITICIANS! Joe Biden is corrupt!** And I am going to make it abundantly clear to everyone I meet and see that Joe Biden and the DNC are a bunch of corrupt bastards who don't care about the American public but only about their power. And I will do this for one reason.

When Joe Biden loses and Nancy Pelosi get destroyed in the house and loses the speakership, I want the first thing on people minds to be, wow I guess people really do hate corruption in the DNC. Sadly Bernie refused to take this fight to these people, so as far as I'm concerned it is now my job. 

Because as long as this corrupt institution that is the DNC is allowed to continue to DESTROY every progressive movement in this country for the sake of maintaining control for the rich, corrupt, and greedy, this country will never change.

So I'm saying it, you not only didn't win my vote but you showed me this ""Democracy"" is a scam and should be unmasked as such!**


So I'm asking all of my fellow Bernie Sanders supporters to come out against corruption, by starting the first Anti-Corruption Platform(and than later party). We need to get the message out that the American people are fucking sick and tried of this corrupt bullshit, and that we need to give them a chance to be able, **to vote for it!

fjcx9u,TruthTold89,"Bernie has refused to take on Joe Biden and ensued Trump's reelection. And I have to say this clearly because the Democratic establishment is too corrupt, I will not vote for Biden!","Look, at the end of the day the truth is simple. **JOE BIDEN WILL LOSE TO TRUMP.** Now the only thing we can do is either sit back and do nothing, or start the necessary conversation about the inherent and abhorrent corruption that lives with the DNC. Because regardless of what we do Joe Biden will lose, and if we don't attack the MSM and the DNC now, come November 2020 they will have wall to wall coverage of how, ""Bernie Sanders and his supporters got Trump elected president AGAIN!""

No, fuck this! Not this time, I will not fall in line and not a damn rally or stupid speech will get me to do otherwise **Because people need to know why Jor Biden will lose and why he will have lost. And that is simply because of one reason, AMERICANS ARE SICK OF VOTING FOR CORRUPT POLITICIANS! Joe Biden is corrupt!** And I am going to make it abundantly clear to everyone I meet and see that Joe Biden and the DNC are a bunch of corrupt bastards who don't care about the American public but only about their power. And I will do this for one reason.

When Joe Biden loses and Nancy Pelosi get destroyed in the house and loses the speakership, I want the first thing on people minds to be, wow I guess people really do hate corruption in the DNC. Sadly Bernie refused to take this fight to these people, so as far as I'm concerned it is now my job. 

Because as long as this corrupt institution that is the DNC is allowed to continue to DESTROY every progressive movement in this country for the sake of maintaining control for the rich, corrupt, and greedy, this country will never change. 

**Enough is enough, they would rather lose to Trump and keep their tax cuts than win with Bernie and give people the belief that THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR OWN LIFE, for the better.

Bernie needs us now more than ever.","I really hope that I’m wrong, but I honestly don’t think tonight’s debate will be a fair contest between the candidates. This is the same corporate media outlet (CNN) that has continually blasted Sanders and his supporters while propping up Biden and the moderate coalition. Other outlets have even shown that CNNs coverage of Bernie has been 3x more negative than other candidates. This is also the same CNN that has already shown a propensity to ask false and misleading questions (i.e., “a woman can’t be president”).

And as if that’s not enough of an obstacle, Bernie also faces an uphill battle against the same DNC that provided debate questions ahead of time to opposing candidates in 2016, and united candidates and big money donors this year to try and crush this movement yet again. I also think that not having an audience present during the debate only helps Biden more considering that Bernie is one of the most electrifying candidates to run. So that takes any audience backing and participation out of the equation.

I really hope that I’m wrong about it, but I just have a hard time believing Bernie is going to get a fair chance tonight. Even after all of the recent events around the world that show his platform is what the working class really needs.

That’s pretty much all he’s got going for him. So, if like me, you sincerely think Biden can’t win. 

Announce as loudly as you can that you won’t vote for him in the general even if he’s the nominee. Unless he adds M4A to his platform. Otherwise you’ll vote for an independent. 

If enough people announce this plan, especially to their Biden supporting friends. It will end the narrative that he’s the only candidate that can win.

I have only seen negative attacks on Biden  in this subreddit over the course of the past two weeks.  With the fact that Bernie has pledged to not run any negative advertisements I believe that we need to change the tone of what is being posted here.  I believe we should follow in the most fit candidates footsteps and focus on why Bernie is the only candidate that will bring real change in our country rather than why other candidates are unfit.  I want to see the change bernie represents happen as much as the rest of you but if we don't live up to his standards then do we really deserve it?  Save attacking other candidates for r/politics or elsewhere.  Follow the example of the only candidate that shows morals matter.

Joe Biden is not the first and certainly not the last politician or public figure to be found abusing children; however, he is currently a candidate for the American presidency. This makes his actions, taken while knowingly on camera, important to discuss.

If this is what is happening on national television, what is going on behind closed doors? And why does no one want to talk about it?

This stuff isn’t made up. This video was not edited to be more damning than it is and it’s not a trick of the light or an isolated incident. This footage is from a senatorial swearing-in—there is other footage out there from other events (although it may be currently hard to find due to YouTube’s algorithms).

1. **Bernie Sanders is conflict-averse.**
2. **Bernie Sanders really respects Joe Biden (not just saying it), because he was one of the few senators that treated him with respect.**

**And that has to change if he (or we rather) want to win.**

**“Bernie is always better on the counterpunch, on the rope-a-dope,” says Mark Longabaugh, who was chief strategist for Bernie’s 2016 campaign. “When he lands, it’s usually a counterpunch, like ‘I wrote the damn bill.’ It’s hard for him to go on the attack.”**

**“I always said, if he learned anything from 2016, it’s that in order to win the nomination, to beat the political establishment, you have to take it from their cold, dead hands. You have to go to war with these people,” the longtime former aide says. “But Bernie is acting like he’s running for State Senator in Burlington.”**

As a result, even as a staggered Democratic Party political establishment scrambled all year to undercut him, [**openly signaling a willingness**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/us/politics/democratic-superdelegates.html) to overturn voter will at this summer’s convention in Milwaukee, Sanders seemed content to keep giving the same speech he’s been giving for thirty years, what some current and former aides affectionately call the “Berniefesto.”

**“I think Bernie likes Joe Biden,” says Longabaugh.**

**“I think Bernie has a really hard time going negative,” says Stoller.**

**“So much of what informs his relationship with people like Biden,” says the longtime former staffer, “is that experience of being the lone independent and outsider. Back then, if any one of those people treated him with respect, as a colleague, that was enough to ingratiate them with Bernie.”**

The former aide sighs. “He doesn’t like Rahm Emmanuel, he doesn’t like Hillary Clinton,” he says. “But he’s okay with Biden, because Biden is nice to him.”

**What’s troubling about this is that Biden has long been a central figure in building the modern, corporate-dominated model of the Democratic Party Sanders spends so much time deconstructing.**

Biden led cheers for the Iraq War and repeatedly lied about that record (“[**Yes, I did oppose the war before it began**](https://www.salon.com/2020/01/16/joe-biden-not-telling-the-truth-about-his-iraq-record--and-hes-been-doing-that-for-years/),” he said just last year). On many occasions he’s expressed [**willingness**](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21012138/ns/politics/t/biden-unveils-plan-protect-retirement-savings/#.XhQqaS2ZPOQ) to cut Social Security and voted for the insidious [**bankruptcy bill**](https://prospect.org/politics/bidens-votes-on-the-bankruptcy-bill-middle-class-joe/). He [**championed NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-14/biden-s-nafta-vote-is-a-liability-in-the-rust-belt), helped write the [**atrocious 1994 crime bill**](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration), and even bragged that George Bush’s infamous Attorney General John Ashcroft [**got the idea for the PATRIOT Act**](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/andrewkaczynski/surveillance-joe) from him.

Bernie has gone after some of this, but even on issues like the Iraq invasion, where Biden has an extensive record of damning statements, he’s let his rival off the hook, propping up Biden’s weak excuse of being deceived by Republicans.

“Joe and I listened to what George Bush, Dick Cheney and Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. [**Joe saw things differently**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2ph_OA4_rg),” was the strongest statement Sanders could muster, in a recent debate.

Bernie is now using more confrontational language like “[**Which side are you on**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/04/super-tuesday-sets-up-bernie-sanders-vs-joe-biden-2020-primary-fight.html)?” with regard to Social Security, but it may be too late. (Why did he wait until *after* Super Tuesday to feature an ad about Biden’s Social Security record?) For most of the campaign, on key issues like this, **Bernie seemed anxious to pick “a line of attack that will bring the least amount of blowback” from within the Democratic Party, as Stoller puts it.**

**Reluctance to cut the cord with Democrats who are “trying to put a bazooka to his head” is part of what finally disillusioned the unnamed longtime aide, who notes that Bernie’s unwillingness to engage people like Biden is “self-sabotaging, but also selfish. It’s not comfortable for him to call out people he likes, but it’s not about him anymore… He has millions of people who’ve put their hopes in him.”**

**The reluctance to engage strongly with Biden speaks to the larger issue of Bernie’s attitude toward the Democratic Party. Sanders clearly sees the Party’s flaws and rails against its susceptibility to corporate influence, but has trouble understanding that the current leadership will never truly accept him and his message, unless forced.** He’s been reluctant to use his mass appeal as a cudgel, preferring to focus on making a case to the public — a strategy that has served him extremely well, but still.

“You gotta weaponize this shit,” says the longtime aide. “You’ve got to go to these people in the party and say, ‘You can either accept it, or be killed by it.’” The aide notes there’s an obvious example of how to use a populist pulpit. “Trump is crazy, but there are things you can learn from him.”",6,1584215392,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fiobiz/heres_why_bernie_sanders_is_very_reluctant_to/,OurPresident,1

fio155,Sui-generis--,Here's why Bernie Sanders is very reluctant attack Joe Biden (and Democratic candidates in general): conflict-averse and Joe Biden used to be nice to Bernie Sanders. And that has to change!," It basically boils down to 2 reasons:

1. **Bernie Sanders is conflict-averse.**
2. **Bernie Sanders really respects Joe Biden (not just saying it), because he was one of the few senators that treated him with respect.**

**And that has to change if he (or we rather) want to win.**

When you cast your vote, you are not only voting for a POTUS, you are voting for who gets picked to be on the Supreme Court. RBG is getting on in her years. There are some justices who are at the age where they could retire. Just imagine this:

Roe V. Wade was overturned today 7-2, by SCOTUS: abortions are now illegal in the US.....

The Supreme Court settled a groundbreaking resolution that since healthcare is a service, it is not a human right, but a choice....

SCOTUS has ruled that voter suppression is a question for the states, and not the courts, leaving millions purges from the voter rolls....


This is the future you can expect after a second Trump term. This is how the progressive movement finds itself gridlocked. I would go so far as to say that we may find ourselves shut completely out of politics—-or even arraigned as criminal obstructionists.

fifyo5,warp_mode,"If Biden gets nominated, will Trump beat him because of his cognitive decline? Please explain, we don't know about it in Germany","I live in Germany and the reporting on the US election is a little skewed here, leaving out many important details. I would love it if Sanders became president but Biden seems to be the clear favorite of the media, even though he seems to have cognitive problems. And this is what scares me - most people in Germany know next to nothing about these problems and can't take them into account. All these past and recent verbal gaffes, the whole ""hairy legs"" thing, ""O'biden Bama democrat"" and half of the population killed by guns since 2007 - I think that if Biden ends up in a 1v1 debate with Trump, he is going to be bitterly demolished and will most likely make a fool of himself. But whenever I point it out to other Germans on the web, most just pretend it's ""rightist propaganda"". So I want to ask you, the Americans least inclined to believe such propaganda: does Biden have a chance against Trump? Are these cognitive issues real or exaggerated?

Thank you for your responses and the best of luck with your campaign!

fidokg,Bbodziak,"BERNIE, BIDEN and TRUMP?","I most definitely will be voting for Bernie in my state's primary because I stand for his policies, his integrity, his history and I could go on and on.  Secondarily, I also believe he has the best chance over Trump due to Bernie's massive following of energized, die-hard supporters who WILL turn out to vote for him like many of us will (provided the DNC doesn't sc#@w him if he has the numbers).  An additional reason is several 2016 exit polls showed many Republicans and Independents stating that they would have voted for Bernie had he been the 2016 nominee--you can easily do a search for plenty of data supporting this.  I believe that these same 2016 Republicans and Independents will strongly consider voting for Bernie in 2020 just as they would have in 2016 -- possibly more Republicans given what they've seen over the past 3 years. 

However, if Biden does actually receive the nomination, what do you feel is the best course of action regarding the election to ensure Trump does not get a second term?

We’ve had a very meaningful and insightful conversation regarding voters for the democratic front runner. It is clear that the elderly voters are oblivious to Biden’s state of mind and has no clue about the upcoming denate with Sanders. In his mind, Joe Biden has a better chance of beating Trump. Even though, he is aware about Sanders’ agendas, he does not think that they are realistic. Thinking the country is too conservative and does not think Sanders can beat Trump. However, little does he know about Biden’s rapid cognitive decline and his absolute perfect alignment with Trump’s agenda. I reminded him again about the debate before we parted ways. I really hope the debate grabs attentions of Biden supporters. Looking forward to seeing offensives from Sanders!

I am reminding every single person I meet about the debate. I urge all of you to do the same. Second half of the total delegates are still up for grabs, so Bernie Sanders could use the debate in his favor.

Bernie is going to destroy biden in this upcoming debate.  But we cant just cheer from the sidelines.  If any message in this country deserves to be delivered with religious zeal, its Bernies message.

Do your part, vote for starters.  But being these great messages outside of the Bernie subs, downvotes be damned.  When you see Bernie policy as the answer to someones concerns, be it about coronavirus or something else - SPREAD THAT GOSPEL.  

When people cross that blighted hellscape on the way to the polls, they should be seeing problems that can be fixed by a Bernie administration.  They shouldnt see ""well Biden said this wouldnt fundamentally change and I guess thats fine.""

So I say, fuck it, if they put up Biden let's start a movement to take out the Democratic party and act to do so by starting an Anti-Corruption Campaign/Party and use the Democratic establishment as the prime reason for it.

We don't have the money currently to start a party from scratch, so instead let's run against the corruption of Washington and the MSM and get support for our platform and then use that to choose candidates. **And the way we make sure we get our message out is to clearly state that WE WILL NOT VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN, because the corruption of the Democratic Party.** And when he loses, we can clearly point out and state all the reasons, **AND completely FREE ourselves from the rule of the Democratic party. They will no longer be able to do as they please and expect our votes and support. THEY WILL LOSE CONTROL COMPLETELY, and then we can create a REAL left movement with out the corruption of Wall Street Democrats in power for it.**

Just a warning, you're going to be getting the ""Bernie is senile!"" argument from Republicans too.  They'll take any mistake he makes and twist it to fit their narrative, so don't expect that either Russia or the Republicans will sit it out.  
  
If you're going to claim that Biden is senile, you're going to be hearing that Sanders is senile too:  
  

 * [Go to 1:04:30. Bernie literally says ""In 1941, we were at war with China and Hitler"". Doesn't correct himself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng)

 * [Proclaimed that ""we will pass gay marriage in all 50 states"" nearly 11 months after the SCOTUS ruling. Makes no sense under any context](https://twitter.com/EsotericCD/status/717543128794861568)

 * [In live interview, Bernie Sanders called Wolf Blitzer ""Jake"" 3 times before Wolf corrected him. Then he still called him ""Jake"" 2 more times](https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-calling-wolf-blitzer-jake-politics-election-campaign-2016-7)

Answers ISIS multiple times until asked a 4th time by Chuck Todd] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/02/05/daily-202-bernie-sanders-trips-up-on-foreign-policy-during-democratic-debate/56b3e57a981b92a22df3af09/)

 * [Even Jeff Weaver said Bernie ""misspoke and conflated a few facts regarding Russia"" in a couple of interviews] (http://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=9fd0fa7c-79e5-4f2d-a08b-a1dcb2b1a2fb)

So the question is: Is Bernie senile?  I mean I don't think so.  Sure he's made some gaffes in his time, but nothing suggesting dementia.  Same is true with Biden.  You can pull up a dozen examples of gaffes, string them all together and make it look like he's going mad, but that doesn't mean he *is* going mad.",4,1584103569,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fhz3ar/from_what_ive_seen_most_of_reddit_seems_to_be/,OurPresident,1

This means people who have been struggling with medical debt or *postponing* seeing a doctor (because they might not be able to afford it) like we’re seeing right now, every day on the west coast, will be able to get the care they need sooner, create a better handle on small and large scale emergencies and incite our society. Small businesses are more capable of lifting off the ground without having to pay for their employee’s health care. More people are able to join that work force. More people are able to comfortably leave their job they might have stayed at for too long because they needed insurance. We would be enabling them to find a job that makes them happy and contribute a more vibrant life into our world too. The reason these ideas are “progressive” is because we’re progressing as a society and making *progress*.",4,1584077698,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fhurp3/in_light_of_covid19/,OurPresident,1

Sanders should just run as an independent. But again you get shame. How dare you split the left vote.  We need to beat Trump together.  OK so then listen to the voters.

fhippm,DumpingTrump,I wrote a debate speech for Bernie. Would like your input!,"Hi all,

I keep trying to think about how Bernie should do the debate and I could never summarize it well enough into an outline, so I just wrote a speech.  I've never written a speech before and never excelled in that subject, but I had to get it off my chest.  If it's terrible, just tell me and I won't be offended!

My thinking was that Bernie should ignore the debate format completely since we know they're simply going to frame the questions in such a way he has to go on the defense.  He needs to take over the narrative on go on the attack.  I don't think his stump speeches are reaching the normal American because maybe they feel he is talking AT them and not TO them.

I have some other ideas about how he can more specifically frame the healthcare crisis to his audience, but here is the speech.

\------------------------

Here we are, just a couple days away from another very important vote for this country. There is no audience here, there is no NBA this season, other major events around the country are being cancelled and our markets are crashing. This virus is spreading with over X number of cases as I speak. Americans are looking forward to hope and inspiration but are finding none of it in this President and the Republicans.

For more than 2 months this President has the called the virus a hoax, a Democratic scam, nothing more than the flu, and to not worry, go to work, and ignore all the medical advice from our top medical advisors.

Also, during this time, he and the Republicans have shown their inability to care about anyone other than businesses and their rich friends during a crisis. The Democratic party is trying to introduce an emergency sick leave bill and another bill to ease to American families. This bill includes

· Free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured;

· Paid emergency leave with both 14 days of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave;

· Enhanced Unemployment Insurance, a first step that will extend protections to furloughed workers;Strengthened food security initiatives, including SNAP, student meals, seniors nutrition and food banks; 

· Clear protections for frontline workers, including health care workers and other workers who are in contact with those who have been exposed or are responsible for cleaning at-risk places; 

· Increased federal funds for Medicaid, as states face increased costs.

However, still, the Republicans are opposing it. What is their alternative? A bailout for large oil companies and business, a defense for healthcare companies to profit during this crisis, and a cut to payroll tax which DOES NOT benefit you, rather it’s another attack to defund social security and other safety programs.

Let’s me say it how it is, the Republican party does not care about you. They may say they do in speeches and in front of crowds, but when it comes down to it and behind those doors, they reject EVERY bill that helps the American people. Why? Because it doesn’t benefit their rich friends.

President Trump said in his “speech” last night that all testing and related medical care would be covered from the major insurance industries. Well, he misspoke, only the testing is covered because those insurance industries were so quick to come out the next morning and denounce any related care costs. They can’t NOT make money off this disease can they?!

Let’s look again at the bill that Pelosi has introduced.

· Free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured;

My plan, Medicare for all, this would already be included. Not just testing, but ALL medical care is covered under Medicare for all.  Imagine, being able to just go into ANY hospital, see ANY doctor, get treated and leave.  No copay on arrival, no follow-up paperwork, no dealing with insurance companies and arguing about what is or is not covered.  You get treated, that's it!

· Paid emergency leave with both 14 days of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave;

My plan for guaranteed family paid medical leave also would cover this.

· Enhanced Unemployment Insurance, a first step that will extend protections to furloughed workers;Strengthened food security initiatives, including SNAP, student meals, seniors nutrition and food banks; 

My plan to strengthen unemployment, a federal jobs guarantee, increases to SNAP and meal programs, again, all this would be covered.

· Clear protections for frontline workers, including health care workers and other workers who are in contact with those who have been exposed or are responsible for cleaning at-risk places; 

Medicare for all would also already cover all this

· Increased federal funds for Medicaid, as states face increased costs.

Medicare for all. Are you seeing a pattern here?!

All my life I am being attacked as a radical, as crazy Bernie, as someone who can’t work with others and some crazy socialist. How is it that during this crisis my ideas are no longer so radical? My party is now trying to get plans passed that I have been fighting for 40 years!  The Republican party and now my friend Joe here want you to think that all of this will ""go away"" if we somehow simply get rid of Trump.

Joe states that he wants to get rid of Trump and return to normalcy, as if I for some reason did not want to get rid of Trump. However, it’s the normalcy part which bothers me the most. Say we get rid of Donald Trump, what is the normalcy that we are returning to? Millions of Americans will still not have healthcare.  What happens when only your or family gets sick and it's not a global pandemic, now you have to go back to paying to stay alive.  Americans will still be burdened with huge amounts of student debt. Housing costs are rising along with other costs of living. Nothing will be done about the climate crisis which will continue to cost us trillions of dollars going into the future if we do nothing about it.

I get it, everyone is scared about not beating Trump, so repeatedly I am being attacked as not being “electable,” but what does that mean? It means that  --NO it’s too hard to do anything that helps the public, or your ideas are too radical (even though I have proved they are not), we just need to get back to “normal”-- so large corporations can get back to making money and profiting off the American people. Joe doesn’t want to do anything to help you on trade or keep us out of war. His healthcare plan will help some people sure, but he still wants to make sure that insurance companies still profit off you being sick. He has no plan for climate change because that would hurt his beloved oil and gas industry friends.

So I ask you Joe, why did you get into this race? I got into this race to continue to fight for the American people and to improve their lives, not just ""return to normal.""  You said you wanted to return honor and integrity back to the office, but then what? What are you actually going to do for the working Americans once we are back to normal?

fhg61p,MrDanteAlighieri,"Unpopular opinion from a French friend: you should not freely give your vote to Biden in the general election, even if you hate Trump.","**TL;DR**: If you give your vote to the Democratic establishment candidate without getting him to promise to implement progressive policies, your voice will be silenced for many years to come. My rationale is supported by what happened in France in the 2017 presidential election. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I – The birth of social security after WWII : a new hope** 

During WWII, France was occupied by the Nazis. As the vast majority of the French people just tried and live their lives under oppression, some actually chose sides. 

On the one hand, the establishment (capitalists, government officials) actively helped the Nazis, producing for them, sending workers to German factories, autonomously organizing Jewish deportation. **The establishment has always chosen fascism over the left**.

On the other hand, the Resistance was formed. It was very diverse, but to put it simple: 

* From London, with the help of Winston Churchill, General Charles De Gaulle led the Resistance from abroad, mostly with conservative patriots.
* Within France, Resistance movements directly fought the Nazis, taking tremendous risk. Those movements were mostly made of Communists loyal to the Soviet Union.

When the war ended, De Gaulle’s forces took power, in an alliance with the Communists, and made sweeping reforms that have shaped our nation since then. Companies that were run by traitors were nationalized, women were given the right to vote, and the social security was created.

**It took a world war, the almost-destruction of our nation, the complete disgrace of the establishment, and an improbable alliance of conservative patriots and communists, so that social security could be born**. Since then, the French have loved their social security, which genuinely is a part of our Frenchness (we pay almost nothing in medical expenses). 

&amp;#x200B;

**II – The 2017 presidential election: the establishment strikes back**

In 2017, the French presidential election was a mess:

* The long-time frontrunner, Republican Party candidate **François Fillon**, had a **neoliberal** economic policy: he wanted to dismantle our social security, lower wages, and so on. His social platform was very **conservative**. He fell in disgrace during the campaign, after a corruption scandal was revealed. He got **20,01%** in the first round.
* **Emmanuel Macron** was a government expert, turned investment banker (Rothschild) before becoming Minister for the Economy. He had never held elected office. He wasn’t member of any party, except the one he created for the sole purpose of running for president. He was supported by the whole establishment, especially **billionaires**, which is useful knowing all French **mainstream media** are owned by 9 (nine!) billionaires. A huge propaganda machine was put in place to support him, making everyone believe he was a “progressive”. He promoted a **neoliberal** economic policy (much like Fillon). He got **24,01%** in the first round.
* **Benoît Hamon** had got the nomination from the former president’s party. He stood for **universal basic income**, which was considered too radical and dismissed as unfeasible. The historic Socialist Party had indeed drifted from left-wing pro-working-class to neoliberal centrism over the years. The establishment (corporate, mainstream media, politicians) abandoned him when he got the nomination and flocked to Macron, basically killing the party and replacing it with Macron’s. Hamon got **6,36%** in the first round.
* **Jean-Luc Mélenchon** was the left-wing candidate. He had an **anti-establishment** **populist** rhetoric. He stood for defending social security, a green new deal and overall **progressive** policies. He was supported by y**oung voters**. The media constantly introduced him as a pro-Cuba, pro-Venezuela, pro-Russia authoritarian. He got **19,58%** in the first round.
* **Marine Le Pen** was a far-right candidate. She had an anti-establishment populist rhetoric. Her economic policy has changed constantly, but she has always run on a **racist**, anti-immigration platform. She (and her father before her) is considered the bogey man of French politics. She appealed to **low-income white voters**. She got **21,30%** in the first round.

As you see, the first round was very close and the votes were dispersed among different ideologies. 77% of the people voted, meaning **Macron was the first choice of only 77%\*24%=18,48%** of the French. He was against Le Pen in the second round. That’s when everyone started to scream “anyone but Le Pen”. Macron was then immediately endorsed by all other candidates except Mélenchon who only said not to vote for Le Pen. Since then, **Mélenchon has been equated to the far-right for refusing to endorse a candidate who represented everything he fought against**, meaning corporate establishment.

**Macron was elected with 66% in the second round** v. Le Pen’s 34%.

What I can derive from this in terms of party politics:

* **An anti-establishment candidate will always be framed as an authoritarian by the corporate media**. This is what happened to Mélenchon. This is what is happening to Bernie.
* **Far-right/racist candidates are used by the establishment so the so-called “moderate” (but really “pro-establishment”) candidates can win by default** (“electability” argument). This is what happened with Le Pen v. Macron. This is what is happening with Trump v. Biden.
* **The establishment would rather see the low-income whites vote for far-right/racist candidates than left-wing/progressive candidates.** They didn’t want Mélenchon to bring back the poor in the political process and on the progressive side rather than leaving them to Le Pen. They don’t want Bernie to bring back the poor in the political process and on the progressive side rather than leaving them to Trump.
* **An anti-establishment candidate will either have to endorse a pro-establishment candidate or be considered a friend of the bogeyman**, even if the anti-establishment candidate has fought his entire career for human rights. This is what happened to Mélenchon. This is what will happen to Bernie. 
* **If the candidate who gets the nomination from the party does not suit the establishment, the establishment would rather destroy the party than support this candidate**. After Hamon got the nomination from the Socialist Party, the Socialist Party establishment went to support Macron and the Socialist Party isn’t worth anything anymore. If Bernie gets the popular vote, the Democratic establishment will try to pick someone else at the Convention, and if Bernie gets the nomination from the Democratic Party, the establishment could support an independent candidate in the general election. 
* **If the candidate of the establishment is compromised, the establishment will find a suitable replacement.** As he got caught in a corruption scandal which compromised his election, Fillon was arguably replaced by Macron as the establishment candidate. If Biden’s health issues were to compromise his election, the establishment would find another candidate to replace him (Buttigieg for example). The establishment would never support Bernie, even as a second choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

**III – The Yellow vests: the return of the people**

So Macron got elected being the first choice of only 18,48% of French people. All other politicians endorsed him without compromise. When he took office, he claimed to be backed by 66% of the electorate (despite everyone knowing **it was a vote against Le Pen and not for Macron**), and started his **pro-establishment, anti-working-class rampage**: 

* abolished the wealth tax on the ultra-rich
* cut taxes on capital gain 
* privatized profitable state-owned companies, including airports
* cut benefits for the unemployed
* substantially cut workers’ rights
* restricted the right to demonstrate
* dismantled the public pensions system

This generated social unrest. Our public infrastructure (esp. railways, hospitals) is crumbling. The very rich get richer, and Macron’s trickle-down economics are a lie justifying his giving more to those who got him elected. When he tried to increase taxes on the middle-class, they revolted. Since November 2018, there have been protests every Saturday against Macron’s policies (the “Yellow vests movement”). The repression has been so violent the UN ordered an investigation into exactions perpetrated by the police. The police is still supporting Macron only because he increased their wages and left them out of the pensions reform. **Despite labeling themselves as “moderates”, the establishment is as much a threat to civil liberties when you stand against their agenda**. 

Yet, he continues his pro-establishment reforms, dismantling our social security and all the rights acquired through history by brave men and women. And any time someone tells him the people do not support his policies, he answers: **“I got a majority in the election, I have the legitimacy to do what I want”.** 

This is the price to pay when you freely give your vote to a pro-establishment candidate, pretexting “unity against the far-right”. Recently, a pro-Macron congressman told an opposition congressman “we are the Republic, you are nothing”, before proceeding to dismantle our pensions despite the longest strike in our history. 

**If you give your vote to someone who stands against everything you believe in, they will use it to silence you**. **Give it to Biden and if he's elected you’ll have no say in what happens next until 2028.** **Vote for Biden only if you can get a deal out of him**. Get him to back Medicare for all, or at least something substantial you could support. Hell, ask for the VP slot! They can’t win without you. You don’t owe the establishment anything. If Biden gets elected, he will be the incumbent in 2024, and you’ll have to wait until 2028 before perhaps having a progressive candidate. At least get something out of it, make your voice count. **Weigh in the election**. Because the establishment always will. **If Trump gets elected, they will blame it on Bernie and his supporters anyway**, like in 2016. Do not accept this sort of **blackmail**. And if he does get elected, **fight**. Keep being political, help each other, demonstrate, be vocal on the internet, support progressive candidates. 

**And** **at the end, you will win**.

However, I’m not able to find any examples because it seems that private industry always comes in after the basic discovery, matures the technology, makes it viable, and brings it to market. So it’s hard prove that the market isn’t necessary.

Take Insulin for example. It was discovered in the University of Toronto under public funding and the inventor sold the patent for 1$. So far, this seems to prove our point. However, Insulin wasn’t really viable for mass producing and use [until the private company Eli Lilly picked it up, purified it, and streamlined production.](https://imgur.com/a/4jEZYJG) These were key steps that needed to happen. therefore capitalists claim “the market gets the credit “

It is defined as *""an era of destruction, often involving war or revolution, in which institutional life is destroyed and rebuilt in response to a perceived threat to the nation's survival""*.

 Seems pretty relevant, considering Trump's oresidency, COVID, the increased public interest in democratic socialism, contempt for the socioeconomic ""1%"", the #MeToo movement. I'm sure that the theory can be criticised, however, it seems to be more meaningful than not.

fhae1i,BottleCapBlues,Why are a wealth tax and financial transactions tax good ideas? I don’t understand the appeal of either. Can you change my mind?,"I was originally Yang Gang, but now support Sanders for President. However, I think two of his financial reform proposals are terrible, terrible ideas.

Wealth taxes have never been successfully implemented, even in the Nordics Bernie likes to point to for support for universal healthcare (which I think is a 1000% great idea). This is for two reasons. First, it doesn’t recognize the mobility of capital. Unlike your labor, it’s very, very easy to move your wealth, especially if you’re wealthy. Tax avoidance for a wealth tax would be quite high due to the mobility of capital, and any attempts to stymie this would run the risk of decreasing liquidity. Second, marking wealth to market on an annual basis would be pretty difficult for many assets (e.g., real estate, trust assets, private business interests). I think it would be moderately easier for liquid, Level I investments (e.g., publicly listed securities), but marking illiquid assets to market would be very difficult. Once more, if most of my wealth is in illiquid assets, how do I come up with the cash to pay a wealth tax? 

I think a better way to address wealth inequality is drastically raising estate taxes. It accomplishes the goals of a wealth tax in one taxable (and definite) event, and is in line with the intentions of our Founding Fathers, who favored an inheritance tax to prevent aristocracy.

I also think a financial transactions tax is a bad idea that would ultimately punish everyday Americans. A real marvel of financial innovation over the past 50 years has been eliminating trading commissions, creating fractional share trading, and moving towards fee-based advisory models. Some of this is due to market disruption (RobinHood), others due to threatened regulation (the DOL rule, which should be reinstated). I think imposing a tax on something that the market worked so hard to create would be a terrible idea, because the ultimate goal of finance is to identify and allocate value, and do so in a way with minimum transaction costs. Implementing a tax would cost real Americans in their pension plans, 401(k)s, IRAs, HSAs, and brokerage accounts.

But I think maybe I’m missing something. Why am I wrong? Happy to discuss :)",18,1583985399,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fhae1i/why_are_a_wealth_tax_and_financial_transactions/,OurPresident,1

However I think had Bernie called her and tried to mend the wound and promise her a position that could've easily been squashed and made a huge difference in Super Tuesday.

Then you have celebrity endorsements like Sarah Silverman as one small example who just *today* finally endorsed Bernie even though she endorsed him early in '16.

Jesse Jackson is another late endorsement that could've significantly helped in the South Carolina primary.

There are also a lack of congresspeople (besides the squad) showing support that the campaign probably could've reached out to. I know Bernie isn't your typical politician and doesn't believe in making backroom deals but this isn't the time to play it safe. Was not reaching out for endorsements and having more press releases with figures standing next to Bernie been a huge oversight in an otherwise brilliantly run campaign? Everytime he goes up to that podium alone it just gives the misconception he's alone with no allies in the political field despite that not being true. 

F the establishment but you have to give it to them, they fell in line behind Biden in a rush those last couple days before Super Tuesday and that's had a lasting effect. Had Bernie done the same thing, had Warren/Beto/Yang/theSquad/some moderates/etc.etc. all standing behind him on a stage in a show of support, these last two weeks could've played out very differently. 

Then again if he had all those on the stage next to him that may have further alienated independent and undecided voters?",2,1583977760,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fh8nk3/did_the_campaign_not_reach_out_for_endorsements/,OurPresident,1

fh7t5h,heraldtaliaw,"The email that my sister and I wrote to my parents. We live in PA. (Don’t know why, but I thought I would share)","Hey, Mom and Dad.

We just wanted to send you this e-mail because it's something that's very important to us.  [MY NAME] strongly feels she would rather say something, even if you choose to take no action, then say nothing at all.  

Last time we spoke, neither of you seemed to have a favorite candidate for the primary.  Maybe you did, but didn't want to talk about it, which I understand.  But if you truly different, can I just please make a short case for why you should vote for Bernie.

I know, for all of us, the key issue is beating Trump.  According to Real Clear Politics, in a general election, the average from multiple polling sites is Sanders at 49.6% and Trump at 44.9%. Please see: https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-6250.html For Biden on the same site https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html, Biden averages 50.0% and Trump 44.5%.  So basically only half a percentage point between the two contests.

So again, we all know that the most important thing is beating Trump. I can't fathom another 4 years of him.  However, I also can't fathom another 40 years of corporate Democracy, with it's continued expanding of the gap between rich and poor, destruction of the environment, and the influence of money in politics.  

Those things also kill, and have led to thousands of deaths in the last 40 years.  I just have to give a quick breakdown of Biden and Bernie's actual records.  Wendy has sources for each of these items.  If you want to see them, please just reply to the e-mail and let us know which you want a source for.

Bernie supports Medicare for All.  Biden doesn't.

Bernie supports a Green New Deal.  Biden doesn't.

Bernie plans to expand Social Security. Biden has a record of trying to cut it.

Bernie wants to cancel all medical debt. Biden won't. Medical debt continues to be one of the largest causes of personal bankruptcy in the USA.

Bernie will legalize marijuana. Biden won't.

Bernie will abolish private prisons. Biden won't.

Bernie voted against the Iraq war. Biden voted for it.

Bernie supports a wealth tax. Biden doesn't.

Bernie proposed legislation to stop drug companies from price gouging. Biden voted against that.

Biden supported the ""Defense of Marriage"" act, preventing gays from getting married

Biden supported bank deregulation by Glass-Steagall, which  led to the housing crises with the sub prime mortgage boom

Biden supported the Patriot Act as proposed by the Bush Administration

Biden opposes net neutrality, which allows companies like Comcast to provide faster and better internet to people who can afford to pay more, while making it slower and crappier for the poor

Biden voted to ban immigrants with HIV from entering the country, which led to Haitian refugees being locked up in Guantanamo Bay

Biden voted to expand deportation and indefinite detention for illegal immigrants. He may not be putting them in cages, but he's treating them like garbage just the same.

Biden worked to undermine the Affordable Care Act's coverage of birth control

Biden continues to oppose federal funding for abortions

Biden said that the CIA torture report is not a ""black stain on this country"" but a ""badge of honor"" 

Again, if you really have already made up your mind, we of course understand.  And if you are Team Biden, of course you should vote your conscience.  

But, if you truly are undecided, and the only thing that makes you want to vote for BIden is a fear of Trump, we are hoping this note will make you reconsider.  Bernie has nearly as much of a chance to defeat Trump as Biden does, and of course in the general election, we will vote against Trump no matter who ends up nominated.


Thanks for taking the time to read this.  Honestly, [MY NAME] and I can't talk about this in person right now.  [MY NAME] is so upset about this, she even called me into the bathroom the other day to take the razors out of the shower because she felt the pull to cut for the first time in years, so we can't discuss this in person.  We hope you understand.  We're not trying to be unfair by dumping this on you and saying ""oh but we can't talk about it""...although I guess it comes across that way.  If you have anything you really need to say, please just say it in e-mail.

Looking forward to dinner tomorrow.

I’ve seen a lot of people talking about fighting *for* Bernie and that has bothered me a bit. Not only that, I do not want anyone to become complacent no matter the out come.

See, Bernie is fighting *with* us because it’s the only way the movement will continue. We all know that Bernie has been fighting a lonely fight with his views for a long time. No matter the nonsense he has stuck to his guns and fought for those being pushed down. 

Now, his voice has resonated with millions finally giving a voice to those of us that have been screaming from the top of our lungs for help. That hope will not die within me now because I know I’m not alone anymore.

We are fighting *with* Bernie because presidency or not, the road ahead will be tough. Bernie is not the revolution, alone. We are all the revolution. 

We fight *for* the friends, loved ones, neighbors and strangers who have died because they don’t have healthcare. (Especially mental health) We fight *for* the millions dead from a drug epidemic with no voice left to fight for change.

I am part of the i-gen, and grew up in a republican family. My parents allowed us very limited internet access, up until our late teens (which I’m kind of grateful for now), and didn’t like it when they couldn’t control information. 

I have lost faith not only in my party, but in my country. I’m a one of the richest towns in my county, and still I see cases of depression, self harm, drug abuse, illegal activity, and suicide around me. I stopped standing for the pledge a while ago, hoping to drag attention to these problems. 

If I could vote, I would do so for Sanders, in the hopes that he’ll help this country get its rights back that we’re stolen from it by third party organizations seeking to take advantage of humanity. 

I understand that not registering for either party won’t let you vote in the primaries, but I don’t care. We’re already a tweedist society, the richest 0.02% of our nation chooses who we get to vote for through funding.

Let me clarify. I’m not angry, I’m just tired. I’ve given up on the possibility that America can be the greatest nation in my lifetime, and probably far beyond that. We’ve given the third party so much power, it can literally spy on us wherever we go, however they like. I know the government does this too, I guess I’m just trying to vent.

fh3yxk,heuve,How many Republicans/Trump supporters are voting for Biden?,"So with record high turnouts in many places, I'm starting to get a little suspicious of Biden's ""broad coalition"". I guess it's entirely possible that many people are passionate about beating Trump and have come to a different conclusion than I have about who's more likely to beat him.

I live in a pretty deep red area, and granted I didn't see many voters at the polls yesterday during off hours. But I got to thinking: if I were a passionate Trump supporter, what's the best thing I can do with my vote.

1. Biden is much less progressive than Bernie; even if Trump loses, according to a Trump supporter's ideals, Biden is by far the lesser evil.
2. Trump has a better shot at beating Biden; Trump keeps saying so himself, but they could also reason themselves into that for myriad reasons.
3. The policies Bernie is supporting are overwhelmingly popular on their own. People can have their opinion on the man himself, but on policy alone Bernie should be the one motivating people to the polls.

It seems like a no-brainer to me. Most of the people in my area probably voted for Biden, but I know for a fact many of them will enthusiastically vote Trump in the general. Despite my hardest googling, I can't find any exit polls that show who Republicans/Trump supporters voted for yesterday. Does anyone have data that could either support or disprove my hypothesis that they're turning out in pretty good numbers for Biden?",11,1583959285,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fh3yxk/how_many_republicanstrump_supporters_are_voting/,OurPresident,1

Really simple, could've literally been a tweet. The problem with Bernie, his platform, and the community is the lack of an open mind. You're not open to any ideas that differ from what you believe, you think Bernie is a saint and anyone who thinks differently is wrong. I wanted to like Bernie because aside from Yang I didn't agree with anyone on a lot of things, but his attitude, the fact he never took Yang seriously and called him a ""libertarian trojan horse"" made it impossible for me to want to support him. Ultimately Bernie's arrogance will cost him the nomination. Have fun losing to Biden, oh and remember:

* Medicare for all will never happen if you ban private insurance

 I like everyone else am excited at the prospect of Bernie being the Democratic candidate and potentially president but given recent primary results I am curious to hear if people here are willing to vote for/throw support behind Joe Biden if he does end up as the candidate.

I voted for Bernie in the primary and I don't really like Joe Biden all that much but ultimately I think I would still vote for him in the general election if it was Biden v Trump. If Biden does become the candidate and loses, im probably going to give up on the Democratic party but for the time being when the opponent is Trump I feel like I would have to vote for Biden with the stakes being so high.

He began his campaign as a longshot outsider. He knew he had no chance of winning, and yet he still asked for his supporters' money and volunteering time. With the help of his supporters, he was able to propel himself into the national spotlight, and get name recognition.

The votes reflected otherwise, and he dropped out, but immediately he gets a job with CNN.

He knew he had no shot of winning. He used this campaign to get his name into the national spotlight.

He essentially has financed his job interview for CNN on the backs of his supporters, and now he's on CNN everyday auditioning for a cabinet position. All of the Yang Gang's money is going to be funneled over to Biden now.

fh2hwf,_Stefanski_Androos_,PSA: To all of Bernie's supporters,"I know it's tough right now. I know watching these election days go by, seeing Biden's name all over, and knowing Bernie deserves more of a chance than he is getting can be disheartening and downright hopeless at times. Don't worry, we all feel it, but it's just a reminder that it's gonna take more hard work than we had ever thought. 

I know after all the work we've put in ti this point and still feel like we're barely scraping by, like every time we take a step forward the media tries to push us 10 more back, it can be tough not to give up. But now is when we have to push *even harder*. We had it easy for a few weeks there, we thought we were gonna float across the finish line, and we thought it was tough *then*. 

The fight has gotten harder, and it's up to us to live up to the moment. The moment that will change history, the moment future generations will learn about in school and we can look back at it, thankful we didn't give up the when we thought it got too tough. That fight is *in* us, and it's our job to bring it out. 

We *can* win this. I'm not saying we will. I'm saying we *can*. But *only if we all stick with it.* Every last one of us. None of us can waiver, not even a little bit. Because it's *all we've got.* We don't have the media on our side, we don't have major donors to finance this campaign. All we have is Bernie. And all Bernie has is us. 

Make calls, knock on doors, talk to everyone you can, educate yourself, make any donation you can whenever you can, even $1 or $2 here and there, and ***VOTE***.

It's gonna be tough but we need to keep up the fight for Bernie *every single day.* And when we win this thing and Bernie is the nominee a couple months from now, we can all look back at all the hard work we put in together, and be that much more proud of ourselves for not giving up, for standing up to the occasion, for sticking with it even through the most hopeless of times and refusing to give up.

It's going to be tough, and it's going to feel so good.

Then we can look forward to taking down Trump, and truly making history.",13,1583953853,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fh2hwf/psa_to_all_of_bernies_supporters/,OurPresident,1

fh2dum,Redpoots,Don't give up. You all are amazing.,"I wanted to say that while yesterday's results were very demotivating, we cannot give up. I've donated hundreds to Bernie's campaign, called my friends and family to convince them to vote for Bernie (in California and Washington), and now I'm determined we need to keep fighting. I need to step up, continue donating so the campaign knows we still support them, and most importantly start phone banking and text banking.

A side rant about myself: Over the past two and a half years, I've been struggling with depression. Over that time, I've emotionally matured a lot and have come to realize that I've been fighting it for much longer than that. My work isn't enjoyable, though it pays well, because it is monotonous, fuels consumerism, and I'm not really helping anyone or changing their lives. Each day, I struggle to get out of bed and I struggle to have motivation anything after getting done with work. My anxiety makes phone calls absolutely terrifying for reasons I can't really explain but every ounce of strength I can put towards this campaign is worth it, starting with text banking to build confidence and on to making calls.

Pushing myself and others to support political reform is the best way we can help others. There are 44 million Americans without health insurance (13% of the population) and even *insured* Americans struggle with medical debt from high premiums, deductibles, co-pays. Medicare for All is the single most important policy which people are overlooking in favor of the electability narrative being pushed by the media. Remember that CNN is owned by AT&amp;T, MSNBC is owned by Comcast. These are two almost indescribably large conglomerates which have a LOT to gain/retain from even more tax cuts for large businesses and from electing a candidate who promises ""nothing will fundamentally change"".

There are many Americans in legalized-cannabis states enjoying their privilege while there are thousands upon thousands whose lives have been thrown off course due to the unjust persecution and sentencing of people of color for possession and other related non-violent crimes. Our planet is in a crisis right now and leadership wants to keep it that way because it keeps them at the helm.

I really could keep going but I worry that I'm not a good enough writer to illustrate just how many different facets Bernie will help us make progress in.

**\[TLDR\]:**

I'm going to do everything I possibly can to keep this movement going. If you have any questions at all don't hesitate to message me, comment on this thread, or whatever you need and we will help you.

I encourage you all, stay positive. Positivity, just like negativity, is infectious. We **still** have time to get Bernie the support he needs to win the nomination and to win the election. The primary is NOT decided yet and the states who have yet to vote matter. They matter a lot. In fact, they matter the most right now because they will be the deciders. Now is the time to get fired up, now is the time to call your friends and families who haven't voted yet.

We will not give up on you, we are not going to give up on our movement.  
The message has not yet reached everyone; there are millions of people so distracted by consumerism, besieged by debt and toil, ensconced in a husk of one-way content consumption, so deep in the morass of a reality generated for them by corporate interests, they cannot see the strength they have, are afraid to seize their lives back from hate mongers, the manufacturers of distraction and mediocrity.  
We all are beginning to see though, our blinders are leaking in the periphery, sunlight catches the eye and teases a new reality, an honest vision, a clean and powerful sight unsullied by manufactured myths or alternative facts.  
We see the problem now, we are ready to face the challenge.  One by one, we will work to bring everyone to the balance of fairness, equality, and justice.  Together we will remove the barriers between us, build walkways and bridges, apply the tools you have reminded us are in our possession; integrity, dedication, love, compassion, honesty, and empathy.

We have learned we are not special simply by merit of being alive; we are not little snowflakes to be pretty and then melt.  
What makes us special are our actions.  
The morals we uphold, the beauty we nurture, the forgiveness, our willingness to teach, to sustain, to heal, to create; all these define //us//, all of these strengthen and define our gossamer thread we weave into the cable of humanity.  Each thread we add, each constructive contribution grows our power against the forces that would erode our unity, mote by mote, or simply rend us apart, fragment us in order to recreate their illusion of segmentation and difference.  

We understand we are the same when it all comes to the end, and we are made individuals by what we do while we are here, by our willingness to grow the strength of all of us, come to terms with our humanity, and love everyone simply because we have realized we are, literally, all one entity.

fh2a54,throwaway342586,Unpopular opinion. Hear me out,"In my opinion Bernie made some fatal errors this election cycle.

1) he didn't attempt to form any kind of coalition with the other candidates or ask for their endorsement 

2) he didn't really give other candidates the time of day or even take their ideas seriously, the most notable is Andrew Yang. Bernie had the opportunity to have a discussion with yang about UBI but chose not to

3) didn't endorse UBI. This would have guaranteed him Yang's endorsement which would have significantly boosted him but he left the opportunity slip through his fingers. Not all hope is lost though, if he manages to pull ahead of biden and endorses UBI then Yang is likely to switch from biden to bernie because yang is endorsing whoever endorsed UBI or is currently winning the primary

4) spent more time making enemies than friends. He spent more time trying to distance himself from other candidates rather than getting close to them and trying to work together

fgoiza,TonicBang,Voter Suppression and what can be done about it,"  
Hi all, I was thinking about the continued cases of voter suppression that are seen and what can be done about it. Obviously it's an immediate issue and needs to be addressed right there on the spot. The tweet I saw today about the polls in ND had me thinking, is there something that can be done about it? 

I'm from the UK originally and was very present during the student protests against tuition in 2010 and the huge kettling issue. [""Kettle,""  is a police tactic designed to either hold protesters until they calm down (in theory) or to direct their movement through a single exit point.](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/kettling-controversial-police-tactic?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1) In the US it's referred to as cordoning or corralling.   
There were a couple of guys who created an app called [Sukey](https://sukey.org/) which was an [online interactive map](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2011/02/04/students_invent_system_to_thwart_police_kettling.html) and used social media and crowdsourcing to identify where [""kettles"" were occurring so protestors could avoid it and stay safe.](https://www.economist.com/babbage/2011/01/28/sukey-take-it-off-again) It was most recently used in NY for the May Day protests in 2017.

Now the app is mostly defunct, sadly it hasn't been updated for a while. But one of the creators did share the code on [Github](https://github.com/gausie/croud)  which made me think, could it be utilised into a live map of polling places, and where suppression tactics are occuring. Then advocates such as [Fair Fight](https://fairfight.com/), [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/issues/voting-rights/fighting-voter-suppression), [LWV](https://www.lwv.org/voting-rights/fighting-voter-suppression)  and any local lawyers/advocates who are able to be on call on the day such as advocating for voters who are turned away for not having ID, or having to cast provisional ballots, but also services such as [Pizza to the Polls](https://polls.pizza/)

Tbh, I've done a bit of research and I'm a bit confused still and have no idea if what I'm talking about is correct (legally),  I'm now able to vote this year in the US and I'm pretty excited about it, but also really appalled that this stuff is happening at the polls in plain sight. I'm sadly not a programmer so can't make a go on this code, but I wanted to put it out there to see if there was even a seed of an idea.   


**TL:DR Use open source mapping code to collate live info on polling stations and voter suppression tactics to connect to advocates who can get involved to negate some of the effects, and let people VOTE.**",5,1583887744,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fgoiza/voter_suppression_and_what_can_be_done_about_it/,OurPresident,1

There is this one gay republican (ironic if you ask me) in my group of friends, and he has just been coming at me since he saw on my bio that I identify as a democratic-socialist. Today he started posting articles about how socialism was being rejected by the United States. This came shortly after he found out I was planning on running for local office and that I'm a Bernie supporter. He's basically just another Republican spreading fear by saying democratic-socialism is just socialism. That Bernie wants the U.S to adopt Communism. How would you best describe the difference between socialism and democratic-socialism? How do you explain that democratic-socialism doesn't lead to communism? Would it be easier to just use the label democrat instead?

Anyways, that’s beyond the point. My mother was democratic but she’s now into the TurningPoint USA, Trump Train, conservative stuff. I’ve asked her why she wouldn’t vote for Bernie and she said “I’m not democratic” I asked her if she would consider and here are some of her arguments that I would like some help with.

•My mom is a hardcore Christian, no abortions or anything unless someone is raped. She says that republicans will uphold her Christian values more and that all democrats believe in abortion.

•She opposes the legalization of marijuana, she says it’s bad and kills brain cells. She also claims it brings violence and gangs. I’ve told her that legalization will stop most of that stuff because making it legal prevents people from having to go through things like that to get it.

•She doesn’t believe in military cuts. I told her that instead of military violence and bombing third world countries we should be getting things too. She says a strong military is what we need.

•she’s loves cops, she’ll thank one for their service when she sees them and thinks Sanders doesn’t like cops

•She says all democrats are racist because her college professor said something against whites and that prisons are slave labor for the whites or something like that.

Our world is failing in every sense except the mass awakening of the people across the globe. I have full confidence and trust in every supporter that we can win this, even if I cant contribute in any way except for motivating you guys.

fgdwo1,mexicanlizards,[Meta] This sub needs to evaluate its priorities,"This sub has become toxic and is no longer a place I like to be, and I say that as someone who will absolutely vote/donate/canvass for Bernie over Biden in the primary. The amount of anti-Biden sentiment on here honestly makes me think it's just another Russian disinformation campaign in full swing. I'm not subbed for anti-Biden memes, I'm subbed because I like Bernie's policies and his record and I want to see him do well in the election.

I've been subscribed here since the 2016 election, and I agree that Bernie would likely have won against Trump. That said, I find myself more and more alienated by the things this sub posts on the regular. You want to see a sub that stays on message without resorting to these unwarranted personal attacks? Check out /r/LateStageCapitalism because they do a great job of it.

If you're looking to be effective, you're having the opposite impact. Every time people see some Trump-esque edited clip of Biden trying to make him look drunk/senile/out of touch it just pushes them further away from this community. I'm sure everyone here enjoys it, but if the goal is to actually build a lasting coalition and an online movement, you're failing.

Talk about Bernie's policies, talk about what he'll do RIGHT not what Biden will do WRONG. Because let's be perfectly clear, we all should have learned a lesson from 2016. By starting these narratives earlier we only give conservatives more leverage if Biden does win the nomination, and helping conservatives is the last thing it seems like this sub wants. We're not trying to sabotage progressive causes, we want to push for them no matter what, which includes even if Bernie loses again. His policies aren't going anywhere, and focusing on things like ""Joe Biden talk funny"" is worse than useless, it has a negative impact. By staying issue-focused we can make sure that these policies are heard and considered regardless of who the nominee is.

You want to effect change? Stop talking about superficial reasons we dislike Biden and **focus more on what we can do** because that is so missing from this sub.

Given the audience I expect this will be poorly received, and I really do understand, but I had to at least try.",20,1583847360,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fgdwo1/meta_this_sub_needs_to_evaluate_its_priorities/,OurPresident,1
fgdu6a,goddamelectrik,Need some optimism from my fellow Bernie supporters,"Ever since super Tuesday, I've been down and out. Seeing Biden win all those fucking delegates really hit me hard. I couldn't believe so many people are that ignorant/scared/toe the party line. How do some of you still see a chance of winning after almost 100 super delegates have already made a decision in the case of a brokered convention? I hate that I feel this way. I'll always be a Bernie supporter no matter what but I just don't see how he can win the nomination now after losing his lead. Even if he were to gain a lead before the convention, he still has to somehow get a majority of super delegates. Even my very conservative boss can see how Bernie is being cheated by the DNC. 

Can someone help lift my spirits? Is there something that I'm not seeing?

To help Bernie win, we need to convert the undecided and even Biden's voters.

I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I should like to help everyone if possible.
Jew - Gentile - Black Man, White.
We all want to help one another, human beings are like that.
We want to live by each other's happiness.
Not by each other's misery.
We don't want to hate and despise one another.
And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.
Greed has posioned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.
Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynincal.
Our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much, and feel too little.
More than machinery, we need humanity.
More that cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost.
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all.
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair.
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people.
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...

Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
You are not machines!
You are not cattle!
You are men!
You have the love of humanity in your hearts!
You don't hate!
Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural!
Soldiers!
Don't fight for slavery!
Fight for liberty!
In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ""the Kingdom of God is within man"" - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men!
In you!
You, the people have the power - the power to create machines.
The power to create happiness!
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.
Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite.
Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security.
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power.
But they lie!
They do not fulfil that promise.
They never will!
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people!
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!
Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

fg90q3,A_Clockwork_Black,The Destruction of The Progressive Movement By Elizabeth Warren,"I held off on posting this until I was certain that there was absolutely no chance that Senator Elizabeth Warren would Endorse Senator Bernie Sanders prior to the beginning of the March 10 vote. 

There was an interesting discussion on the Twitter yesterday. If you’re not familiar with Anand Giridharadas (@anandwrites on Twitter) he is the editor at large at Time Magazine, a contributor on MSNBC and often has the most fair-minded illuminating takes seen today on that network, particularly with regard to the class struggle in America, the wealthy class, plutocracy, oligarchy and so on. 

He created a long thread which read in part: 

“What is going to be important in the coming weeks is for those who actually want progressive change to drown out the voices of those who would rather turn people away from the movement than lure them in.

“The brightest leaders of the movement, and leaders of electoral campaigns, tend to know this.

“But there are private citizens out there who aren’t doing the cause any favors. One has to wonder their true agenda, because it seems the opposite of that of the leaders of their cause.

“What is going to be important in the coming weeks is for those who actually want progressive change to drown out the voices of those who would rather turn people away from the movement than lure them in.”

The point of the thread was basically that Bernie Sanders supporters have a responsibility to be above the negativity, to persuade and to create new allies (particularly out of Warren supporters presumably) and that the current political moment is so pivotal that we would do immeasurable damage to the prospects for progress should we neglect that responsibility. 

I agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly. However, we do have to acknowledge the fact that some of the feelings hurt during 2020 primaries will not heal any time soon and while it’s easy to say that people need to grow up and look at the bigger picture, some of us grownup, voting-age people lack this sort of adult perspective. That’s simply how it is. Living proof of this are the Hillary supporters still obsessed with her loss almost four years ago and still lamenting the day that Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein &amp; James Comey were born.

Knowing how political woulds can become permanent scars to those possessed with ideological passion, how could Warren have been convinced (by herself or others) to lean in to the story about the private conversation with Bernie in which he supposedly told her that a woman could not win in 2020? How could she have been so blind to the utter imprudence of employing such a banal political gimmick?

I don’t want to re-litigate that episode but in consideration of the importance of this political moment in the life of the progressive movement it may be illuminating to ask ourselves a few questions: Did this episode help her; did it help Bernie? Did it help the movement? Can we agree that no one will ever know the truth of what exactly was said in that conversation but the two individuals who participated in it? Would we not all be better off if the story were shut down as soon as it surfaced?

In hindsight it seems this was a way of cultivating the tough girl persona which became an ever increasing part of her campaign and furthermore It seems Warren has yet to accept the sheer folly of this manufactured feud and the damage it’s done to the movement of which she purports to be a part. 

Last week after having dropped out of the race she went on Rachel Maddow’s show and continued to perpetuate the myth that Sanders supporters are somehow uniquely hostile and aggressive and tripled down on the absurd claim that Bernie is somehow responsible for the behavior or his millions of supporters. It’s hard to imagine her endorsing him at this point, and with her further driving a wedge between her and Bernie’s respective bases it’s even harder to imagine that she gives a single fuck about the progressive movement. 

The odds are now against a Sanders victory in the Democratic primaries but I am hopeful that he can prevail. But if my and many of your hopes are not realized it is not unwise to consider the possible fallout and the role Senator Warren has played in this potential debacle. 

It is important that we reconcile with Warren and her supporters but that is only possible inasmuch as we can overcome the damage she has done and continues to do even now.",5,1583818535,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fg90q3/the_destruction_of_the_progressive_movement_by/,OurPresident,1
fg8zib,knightfluttershy,I don’t understand the “But how you gonna pay for it?” Argument against Medicare for All,"Let’s say the total amount of money it costs to provide healthcare to the US population via private corporations is X.  Now let’s say the amount of money it costs to do everything else (such as fund ads for said private companies and other overhead costs) is Y. Therefore, the amount healthcare costs the US population is X + Y.

Under Medicare for all, we take away all the money for ads and stuff that isn’t needed. So we’re just left with X, to be paid for via taxes rather than via private purchases. Now, if we take away the private companies and fund X via taxes, it costs the entire US much less. 

So what exactly is the argument against this?

fg6si7,EveningStarNM,"""It's the votes, stupid.""","Whatever else you say about Bill Clinton, he was right about presidential elections: ""It's the economy, stupid."" But if you don't get out the votes, it doesn't matter what you talk about. Hillary proved that.

In October, 2016, Hillary Clinton's campaign managers in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania virtually begged her to campaign in their states and to help get out the vote. Trump was there, but she was campaigning in places that she was already certain to win. California, for instance. We all know what happened next.

On Super Tuesday 2020, only 14% of eligible voters under 29 turned out to vote. That's down about 10%.

We aren't getting them to the polls. Even worse, a number that low shows that they have no enthusiasm at all. In 2016, turnout was driven from college campuses, and we heard news every day of activists working to nominate Bernie. I think we could have, if the Democratic Party had been actually democratic.

This year, there's much less coverage of those activities. I'm personally convinced that the corporate media is deliberately suppressing positive news about Bernie. But we new they would do that. We expected it.

We aren't getting the voters out, and we aren't getting the facts out.

Instead, the public is being told that Bernie's supporters are all assholes, so you shouldn't vote for him. There is no difference in negative posts among the different candidate groups (I saw one report of 2%-3% inflammatory posts from supporters of each candidate), but we aren't getting the news out that it's propaganda. Instead, Bernie's approval ratings are in the toilet.

When a majority of people think you're an asshole, it doesn't matter if they're wrong. It's still your problem to solve. I haven't seen much self-examination being done by us, as Sanders supporters, to try to learn what we have done to dig this hole.

What did we do that reduced young voter turn out? What was our rule in the public's change of heart about us? What can we change about ourselves and what can we do to earn the People's trust back?

One must just stop and listen, it may just a quiet whisper, but it grows ever more certain, as numerous voices comes to join it's chorus.

What will you do when it's quiet melody ignites to millions of thundurus voices singing in unison, to loud to be ignored?

For it is the song of the angry downtrodden and it grows ever louder.

So I implore you, stop even just for a moment, listen to it's emotional melodies.

I just ended phone banking for the first time, and let me tell you, it was a trip.  Talking to supporters, talking to undecideds, etc. was great.  The issue is talking to those who are current day republicans (and I say this while having some older republican values).

I got:

* Bernie is a little bitch (no evidence, just ""Bernie is a little bitch"" when I wasn't sure I heard what she said - the woman mumbled a bit)
* Fuck you and fuck Bernie
* Guess what?  I'm a republican.  Go eat shit.
* I'm undecided and unless you come here and face me, I'm going to stay that way (to be fair I'm not sure if he's threatening violence or asking for a serious discussion - I'm going to assume the latter)
* An actually hilarious joke caller who kept me on the line for like 30 seconds with one of those prank answering machines

My point is it's super important to be respectful and not stoop to the low level here.  I'm aware of the ""They go low, we go high"" thing, but that's not quite as applicable here.  I've never treated anyone that way and I hope nobody here does either.  It's super tempting to spit vitriol back but if you really want to get back at them, REALLY want them to question if what they did was right, just ignore it or ""Oh sorry, what?"" and ask them to repeat it.  Then just brush it off because THEY DON'T MATTER.  I wish they did, I wish they mattered, but they made it very clear they don't want to be involved with me or have a simple discussion.

As a post-note, I used to work as a tele-fundraiser so they didn't even get close to the worst I've ever heard!

Biden simply represents so much of what is wrong with the current political status quo, while Bernie offers the so urgently needed change - just to make my position clear.

That said, I can't help but feel there is tad difference between ""Bernie is the better/best choice because &lt;lots of good reasons here&gt;"" and ""Hahaha, Biden is a really old man who can't talk and has dementia etc."". Because the latter is feels more on the negative/smearing/toxic side of things - something I'd expect to see (well - to be honest - in a far far worse fashion) on a certain quarantined subreddit, but not here.

I almost fear that I will be downvoted to oblivion and/or banned for criticizing/disagreeing with the mainstream here. If that will be case, so be it - I still feel need to give a heads-up that the direction this is going is seems (at least to me) a bit murky.

So I am not very strong on talking with people on the phone, and I have extreme social anxiety.
But the fact of how important tomorrow is had me needing to do something. So I decided to go on my Facebook and message all of my friends who were living in states that vote tomorrow. It’s not much but it’s what I can do with confidence. I had about 15 fb friends who were in those states, and I simply wrote a message telling them why their vote is important, why Bernie is the right choice in this important election, and why change is needed and not just the DNC “safe option”.  Out of the 15 people who have responded (so far) all 8 have committed to voting for Bernie. 
I also asked them to reach out to friends and family in the states tomorrow and spread the word of why Bernie needs their vote. 
I see this as a small pebble in a large lake, but it’s something I suggest those who have anxiety about calling strangers could do. Because if you reach out to your friends, who then reach out to their friends, and so on and so fourth, we have a grassroots effort in this grassroots campaign.

The venue that I work at answered calls for three major cancellations today. It's a venue on a university campus, and there's some talk of a university closure altogether. That means no pay. The other job I work supports performing arts venues up and down the east coast. That one is at least a remote job, but if events are cancelled then there's no work to be done, which again means no pay. As a non-salaried worker at both, I'm pretty frightened. 
I realize that I'm not a particularly vulnerable demographic to coronavirus. But that doesn't change the fact that the response to this pandemic has given me no hope for the way tpotentially much more dangerous outbreaks would be handled in the future without someone who actually gives a shit about people in the white house. 
Things got very real for me today as the calls for cancellations came in, and i need to do everything I can to get Bernie Sanders elected president and change this absolutely miserable system. 
Hopping on the Bernie caller tonight and I'm hoping it'll make me feel some hope, but frankly, if anyone has some words of encouragement to share, I'd love to hear them.",3,1583792015,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fg2ylv/im_about_to_call_for_bernie_and_hopefully_reach/,OurPresident,1

fg1rdu,TimeRockOrchestra,"As a Canadian, I whole-heartedly support your movement and hope that Americans will make the right choice this time.","I remember when I was a kid, America was the country that we Canadians looked up to. It was a country of dreams and prosperity, where opportunity was abundant and people from all over the world could fulfill themselves and contribute to the betterment of humankind. Back then we were jealous of our neighbors. Not anymore.

I've watched your country's slow degradation in the past two decades. I've seen your government's inability to follow the progress of other developed nations when it comes to offering opportunity and social mobility to everyone. I've watched as you engaged in more and more wars, spending half of your government's revenue killing people in the middle east. I've seen the rise of homelessness and the destruction of the middle class first hand, as I traveled across the west coast and the mid-west, and I know those are not even the worst parts. I saw the stress and anxiety caused by your archaic healthcare system. I've witnessed tax cut after tax cut for the rich, who are already avoiding taxes and hoarding billions of dollars in offshore accounts while normal wages can't keep up with inflation.

You have to break this cycle. Your country will never be great again if you don't. Bernie Sanders is a once-in-a-lifetime candidate. He has always been on the right side of history, and always fought for you guys. You might never have the chance to elect a politician like him again, which is why I URGE you to vote. If Bernie loses the nomination, you might look back at this moment in history as the time where America crumbled and never quite recovered.

It's time for corporate interests to take a backseat and let the workers and families of your country take the wheel for a while. You can do this. Most Americans that I met are intelligent and caring people and I trust that you will make the right decision.",3,1583787577,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fg1rdu/as_a_canadian_i_wholeheartedly_support_your/,OurPresident,1

ffx0xq,SerThoros,Help! Trying to flip an independent voter,"Before I start just let me say forgive me if you see this post on other Bernie subs. I'm not looking for karma, I'm just hoping to reach a wide audience and get as many answers as possible 

My friend is an independent. He voted for Clinton in the 90s because that was his first election, voted for Obama in 2008, and only voted for Hillary in 2016 because he knew a Trump presidency would be disastrous. He likes Tulsi and might vote for her when our primary rolls around, but I'm trying to convince him to vote for Bernie and I need some help. He has some concerns that I can't 100% answer for because I'm bad at these conversations

He has some concerns about what might happen to large businesses in the US if the tax on extreme wealth were implemented. He hates Bezos but says he ""took a risk"" when he started Amazon, and if Bernie were to tax the hell out of him, what's to stop him from packing up and moving to Sweden or Switzerland or something? 

If the federal minimum wage is raised to $15/hour, what's to stop corporations like McDonald's from raising prices on their goods to make up the lost profit? 

Finally, we're in a labor union. Bernie has, by far, the best infrastructure plan for the US. But he's concerned about who's going to get that work. We're ironworkers, so we're a private union. He's concerned that all that work will be federal contracts handed out to public unions. I told him Bernie wants to increase union membership in general, but he wants more specifics. ""Which unions, public or private?"" 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm sure he'll come around if I can give him satisfactory answers to these questions

If you live in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Washington go to a field office.

#[Make Calls](https://www.berniepb.com/)

The most important thing you can do from home is to make calls to get out the vote. 

It's easy. You'll be calling Bernie supporters to make sure they have a plan to get to the polls. Many have already voted which means you take them off the list so you and the other phonebankers can keep calling to reach those who haven't voted yet. 

[BerniePB makes it fun. Do it!](https://www.berniepb.com/)

******


#[Text for Bernie](https://berniesanders.com/text/)

Another important thing you can do from home is to text people to get out the vote. 

It's super easy.  You get a list of Bernie supporters and you text reminders to get to the polls. Many have already voted which means you take them off the list so you and the other texters can keep reaching out to those who haven't voted for Bernie yet. 

[Textbank for Bernie](https://berniesanders.com/text/)

#Spread the Bern

This is about a show of force. People like to vote for someone who can win. Projecting strength and support makes us even stronger. 

Everyone should wear Bernie gear, everywhere. Put up a banner. Make your car a Bernie Mobile. Decorate your dog. Pass out literature on your own. Set up a Bernie table on your front lawn, at your university, anywhere.


******

#Provide rides to the polls and other support for voters

There may be long lines, broken machines, changed polling sites.  If you hear about problems like this go to the place - pass out water and snacks, entertain people in the lines. Advise people who show up at the closed sites where the new sites are. Be nimble and smart and find ways to make the best of the situation for the voters. 

*****

#Offer to Help another Berner do any of the above

If for some reason you really can't canvass, go to a field office, make calls, text or otherwise get the word out about Bernie then you can still help by assisting someone who can.  Volunteers can stay longer and be more effective if they aren't concerned about missing work or caring for family and other responsibilities. 

Offer your help to Berners who need help with rides, childcare, errands, or any other responsibilities that might keep them from volunteering for Bernie and being able to stay longer and work harder.

*****
*****

#Vote Early

If possible you should vote early. It's convenient. You don't have to wait in lines. Vote early, and bring a friend. If you vote early you can help get out the vote, poll watch, help people in lines on election day, offer to babysit or take on an extra shift so someone else can vote on election day.

Remind your friends and family in these states that they can vote NOW!

ffskcu,Thoughtful-people,Assault Weapons,"**""Assault weapon is a term used in the United States to define some types of firearms. The definition varies among regulating jurisdictions but usually includes semi-automatic firearms chambered for centerfire ammunition with a detachable magazine, a pistol grip and sometimes other features such as a vertical forward grip, flash suppressor or barrel shroud. Some firearms are specified by name. At the time that the now-defunct Federal Assault Weapons Ban passed in 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice said, ""In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use."" The origin of the term has been attributed to legislators, gun control groups, the media and the firearms industry.

Now I have a dilemma, do I vote with how my candidate of choice would have me vote, do I go with something different, or do I just not vote at all.

Personally, I don’t have any issue with Biden. I think that he is an alright candidate, and that people are willing to vote blue just to usurp Trump, but the support behind Sanders seems to be very concentrated, and I want to know why.

So why, why should I vote for Sanders? What is the case to be made for him, and how will that effect my life? 

I don’t care about what marches he was in, or how many post offices he has renamed, I want to know why voting Sanders is in my best interest.

Once again, I don’t have anything against Biden, don’t try to convince me that Biden is bad, and Bernie is our only hope, sell me on Sanders, and show why I should vote for him.",85,1583732230,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/ffpzbx/sell_me_on_sanders/,OurPresident,1

If we can show how Bernie is better CURRENTLY, it will be much more effective than looking at what Biden used to do. But still use it as a secondary source by all means.

ffnw1k,momsforbernie,"I think my mom would get on board if she heard more about Bernie the human, rather than Bernie the politician","Currently, my mom is leaning Biden. I'm trying to convince her to vote Bernie in the primary (she'd 110% vote for him as the nominee). I think a lot of it has to do with constantly hearing about him being radical and the ""revolution"" talk in general, which makes her think he's unelectable.

The thing is, I know she would change her mind if she got more exposure to Bernie the *human*, as opposed to Bernie the *politician*. If she could hear him talk about, say, compassion being the driving force of his campaign. Or, about his work furthering equity and social justice and just generally being an advocate for the most vulnerable of society. Really, anything that conveys what we all know, but doesn't get talked about enough: that Bernie is a genuinely honest, caring, good **person**, and a politician second (and has been consistently so his entire life—something that seems almost entirely unique in the political world these days).

If anyone could help point me towards interviews/speeches/endorsements/etc that highlight this, it would be much appreciated.

ffedpw,smewthies,So many of these issues are interconnected,"I’m tired of the rhetoric from greedy selfish people saying we took on the student loan debt, we know what we signed up for, it’s our job to pay it off. What about Wall Street bailouts? What about trillions in tax cuts for the rich? This is all coming from my parents’ generation, the boomers.  

My parents pretty much forced me to go to college. I wanted to pick a degree with good job outlooks, good pay and something I’d enjoy. They steered me to pharmacy. After 6 years of school the market turned upside down and I had to move across the country just to get a full time job. My school LIED to me about scholarships. I was about to go to Ohio Northern and had a decent scholarship. But it’s in the middle of a corn field and I would have been miserable. I decided, through guidance of one of my teachers, to pick Butler University in Indianapolis instead. They are similarly expensive, and BU said they give scholarships to “everyone” to make it cost more like a normal school. Well time comes for orientation and what do you know, they lied! For the pharm students they only give scholarships to the top 10% of students (cue Bernie with top 10% numbers 😂). So I had to take student loans out the wazoo. I have about $250k debt. I’m slowly paying it off over 14-20 years making extra payments if I can, but the minimum monthly payment is $1885. The plan was to live with my parents for a few years and pay off my debt but you can’t do that when the market is saturated and you can’t find a job where they live. Meanwhile more unaccredited degree mills are popping up and saturating it even worse.   

One thing that struck me is that my mom (when I was in high school and didn’t know any better) said student loan debt is the “good kind of debt.” Says my mom, the Trump supporter. Married to my physically, emotionally, mentally abusive, Trump supporting dad who she enabled for years. Did nothing as I had to endure a traumatic childhood. I loved her so much but now I wonder why she enabled him. Now I have PTSD and of COURSE my insurance doesn’t cover a therapist. So I have to pay $170/hour. So instead of every week I go every other week or monthly.  

All these issues are interconnected. We need single payer medicare for all. I know healthcare workers would take a pay cut, but it’s worth it not seeing people unable to afford inhalers, insulin, epipens and more every single day. I saw a graphic with the top occupations supporting/donating for Bernie and among teachers, construction workers, and other middle class workers were pharmacists. We’re tired of the greed from the insurance and pharmaceutical industries.  But I feel like single-payer M4A has to be tied to cancelling student loan debt or I’ll be screwed once again. Boomers say we “knew what we signed up for” but we really didn’t. I wish I could work part time at Arby’s like my mom did to pay her way through school. How nice would that be? But I guess I’m just another entitled lazy millennial 🙄


And I’m one of the lucky ones. At least I’m able to make a decent living, but I’m not an asshole, I know there are so many who are worse off than me. My parents complained when they had to pay taxes in April and blamed the shit out of Obama when they owed maybe $1000. This year they owe $6000 and are silent about Trump. I told my mom how Bernie isn’t going to raise their taxes except for healthcare, that he wants to tax rich people not the middle class. But she doesn’t even use her brain and just completely ignores me. I make more than her and told her, I’d love to pay more taxes to get everyone healthcare. I told her she goes to church more than me but isnt that what Jesus teaches? *crickets*",16,1583682846,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/ffedpw/so_many_of_these_issues_are_interconnected/,OurPresident,1

ffbs7n,garbonzo607,URGENT - Please help us urge Bernie Sanders to BOLDLY draw the NATIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCY link between his policies and the Coronavirus outbreak IMMEDIATELY,"&gt;“Millions of Americans are worried right now of a pandemic and this administration is *not* doing all it can to stop its spread. They are not only scared of catching it, they are scared of the medical bills they will get and they are scared that if they take time off from work, they will not have a job when they return to work.

&gt;“I urge President Trump **and** Senator Biden to join me and our campaign in fighting for *guaranteed paid sick leave* and *Medicare-For-All,* as every other major country does for its citizens.”

Can you imagine Bernie saying this and how that will go across at the upcoming ~~debate~~ town hall?

There are many who simply don’t know *Biden does not yet support guaranteed paid sick leave*.

Saying this will put enormous pressure on Biden to cave, and even then Bernie will look strong for pressuring Biden.

I’m an internet marketer and Coronavirus-related products have surged well over **1000%** so far. 

*Americans are in fear, and Bernie’s policies would* **directly** *help stop the spread of viruses.*

I personally have a friend who is scared to call in sick because we have no paid sick leave where we work.

America is the richest country on Earth, this is a horrible situation to be in, and we can help stop it!

There are fantastic articles on this from *Democracy Now!* and *Vox*.

It’s Medicare Or Coronavirus For All:

https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/03/06/its-medicare-or-coronavirus-all

America’s Bad Sick Leave Policy Could Make The Coronavirus Outbreak Worse:

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/27/21155901/coronavirus-in-us-spread-paid-sick-leave

I see the Bernie campaign lightly touching on this, **but it’s not enough.**

In my marketing department it’s literally all hands on deck for this campaign because **it is working so incredibly well.**

**Please**, I beg of you, *our goal should be to get the Bernie campaign to test it and they will see it works*. I can personally guarantee this.

If anyone can help get the word out on this, we would all be deeply appreciative.

**You can also help by posting how Bernie’s policies can help stop the spread of outbreaks on social media, friends and family, etc.**

Because this is a text-post that takes some time to read, it will be at a disadvantage vs. the link and image posts on this subreddit and I expect it won’t get many upvotes, but I had to try.

ff8mas,AldrichUyliong,Bernie Bros are REAL and they're ruining our movement.,"Bernie needs to bring out a nationwide ad discussing Bernie Bros PRONTO. Seriously. Yes, the Bernie Bros are OURS.

I've been to Facebook and Twitter recently and I've seen the voters of other candidates spell out in black and white this is their main issue with us - especially Warren voters now jumping ship to Biden. They AGREE with us on the issues, we're just a bunch of assholes to them about it. Which is turning them off. For some, this is their only hurdle from joining us despite our ideological compatibility. We are throwing away their votes. We are sabotaging ourselves!

Bernie has a million vote deficit vs Biden. We desperately need as much of them as possible to join our ranks and catch up. It is foolish to mock and dismiss them as fragile and not LISTEN to what they're saying.

There's a way I think Bernie could use this problem to his advantage. The ad could allow Bernie to cast himself as both a paternal figure, a uniter, a consoler of all the people Bernie Bros have been assholes to, someone to trust to bring the fight to greedy industry execs and DC corruption, a champion for people the party leadership has pandered to and then ignored and, as a finisher, the best possible candidate to bring down Trump. 

Bernie could also use the ad to open up a little more about himself and humanize his movement and gain the trust of some suburban voters. But, above all, it will activate and give permission to all these gettable but hesitant voters to join us.

I cannot stress enough how important this is.

ff60lp,A_Banana25,Important realization that needs to be discussed.,"Let me preface this by saying I am getting my friends to vote for the first time ever in a couple days.

I dislike Trump and his supporters very much, but we need to realize they’re smarter than us (whether it be accidentally or not). Them saying “the left can’t meme” is true to an extent. Our memes are good but they aren’t effective. They don’t reach out to any new groups.

Remember in 2016 [some](https://imgur.com/yxfVhV6) of [these](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRqXfnL6bocFaEx8W5Gaho-7VpbyfyctxPmEGfTE2_kwRYVuh6G) “memes”. They aren’t really funny or ironic at all, but these played a huuuge part in getting Trump elected whether you admit it or not. His followers spammed this stuff all over Facebook reaching millions of people.

I hate to break it to you, but posting the same 3 pro-Bernie posts every week on Reddit isn’t getting anymore people to join us. We all know we can’t rely on young voters anymore. We need to start marketing our memes to the older generations on Facebook.. Biden wanted to cut Social Security, voted for the Iraq war, and is going senile. we need to get these points across to centrists and moderates before we get four more years of Trump. If we don’t, guess who is going to.

ff4q6d,justuhhhregularguy,Soup or Tuesday was a blessing in the skies,"Believe it or not super Tuesday was a blessing in disguise. We came out winner's all things considered, even if we didn't win the majority. I'm not sure if I've seen it mentioned by anyone, I know for a fact it wasn't covered by the media. Super Tuesday proved that Bernie Sanders is a winner and that Joe biden doesn't have the strength to beat Trump, and here's why.


1. Biden was getting postive media coverage from the beginning of the election un until then, Bernie would purposely be given little to no recognition from the media including leftwing outlets and so forth. We are all aware of Bernie blindness.


2. Biden lost 3 consecutive states in a row. The only reason he won SC by a large margin is because this is where he had poured the majority of his campaign in up until then.


3. This is the most important part. It took 3 candidates dropping out and 2 endorsements from from 2 of them, in order for Biden to be a viable candidate on super Tuesday. His vote count would not have been nearly as high had they all stayed in.


In other words despite the media propping him up, despite the other 3 candidates dropping out and 2 endorsing him, despite the media ignoring ""other"" and then vilifying Bernie when finally getting coverage, despite the DNC making it clear that Biden is their choice. Biden did NOT blow Bernie or our movement out of the water. We are being purposely led to believe that we lost and our endeavours are fruitless, but the fact that it took all that effort and we still came in neck and neck proves that we are more powerful and that we have a viable movement. All of this through individual donors and grassroots campaigning.


What super Tuesday has done; while is a harsh reality check, has reminded us what we are up against. With that said if we had won super Tuesday we might have become complacent, assumed we had it in the bag and potentially have lost. Right now we have the opportunity to take back the election and win. We have been reminded that despite Bernie's large online support we NEED to get out there and actually VOTE. Not just share memes and but phonebank text bank canvas and get friends a relatives to do the same. Also remind as many people as you can to vote early to avoid polling stations closing and them becoming potentially overwhelmed by the large lines.",9,1583628811,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/ff4q6d/soup_or_tuesday_was_a_blessing_in_the_skies/,OurPresident,1

Donate, tell friends/family who live in these districts to vote, or volunteer time (you can volunteer even if you don't live in that district!).

few5cs,_Stefanski_Androos_,"This is the first campaign I've ever donated to, and why it should be yours too","I've always followed and somewhat involved myself in politics, but never had I donated to a campaign. For one, I never really had (and still don't) the extra money to just toss at a candidate.

But this year is different. I feel like I *am* a part of this campaign. I feel like I'm fighting alongside Bernie for the values we both strongly believe in. I feel like I actually owe it to Bernie to chip in what little I can when I can for this battle he's been fighting for us his entire life, and continues to fight now harder than ever.

It's not much, but I chip in my part, and it *feels good*. Instead of buying coffee at a gas station or Starbucks, I make myself a cup at home and give Bernie $2. When I go grocery shopping, I look at my cart before checking out and find one thing I don't need, put it back, and give Bernie another few bucks.

I don't see this as just giving away my money and never seeing it again. It's an investment. Bernie wants to help all of us. I pay several thousand dollars in healthcare costs each year. Bernie's plan would bring that down to just over a thousand. His plans to raise the minimum wage will actually boost the economy, the Green New Deal will finally Advance toward a sustainable future, and my tax dollars will be going towards things *and helping the people* I care about and not toward large corporate subsidies. If a few bucks here and there can help get this done, that's worth this small sacrifice.

When I can, I chip in $2 or $3. It doesn't seem like much, but if *all of us* that think it's not enough to make a difference chip in just $2 or $3, we'll be the factor that makes a true difference in Bernie's campaign and the future of this country.

Create the Iowa irregularities re; poll suppression and Shadow as a red herring to make Pete look like the villian. As Joe Biden falters in IA and NH, people start feeing more and more sympathy for him.

Enter Mike Bloomberg. Pete has done his role, so now Bloomberg comes in as the villian. Literally an Evil Billionaire and the fodder for all the attacks. Joe, who everyone feels sorry for and think will self-implode, avoids scrutiny

 Then they build the comeback kid narrative in NV and the #JoeMentum narrative in SC. And then suddenly, Mayor Pete and Amy Klobuchar drop out giving Bernie no time to focus on Biden. And Bloomberg is still there to split focus. Meanwhile, Warren, the opportunist who pretended to be a Native American and endorsed Clinton over Sanders in 2016 so she could be VP, continued to go about attacking the mythical ""Bernie bro"" who is rightfully angry about increasing corporate exploitation. And go about splitting the vote, costing Bernie ME and MA

If possible you should vote early. It's convenient. You don't have to wait in lines. Vote early, and bring a friend. If you vote early you can help get out the vote, poll watch, help people in lines on election day, offer to babysit or take on an extra shift so someone else can vote on election day.

Remind your friends and family in these states that they can vote NOW!

**Here are some other things you can do.  And we need you to do them, NOW.  This race is close. Now is the time to volunteer. Let's leave everything on the field.** 

Get the BERN app to help you reach out. https://app.berniesanders.com/

#[Go to a Bernie Office](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1FF0kkCtQNEO2ptLtTLDFLONxrTY2mtir&amp;ll=36.32113532542969%2C-95.89031577343229&amp;z=4)

If you live in a Super Tuesday state go to a field office. If you live in a neighboring state go to a Super Tuesday state. Plan to be there for the whole day today and tomorrow.  Call out from work. Ask a co-worker to cover your shift. Find a babysitter. Find a dog sitter. Put off everything else and rush to a Bernie office. There's a lot to do and everyone who can needs to set aside everything to help.  If you can only do 2 hours push yourself and make it 3 hours.

#[Make Calls](https://www.berniepb.com/)

The most important thing you can do from home is to make calls to get out the vote. 

It's easy. You'll be calling Bernie supporters to make sure they have a plan to get to the polls. Many have already voted which means you take them off the list so you and the other phonebankers can keep calling to reach those who haven't voted yet. 

[BerniePB makes it fun. Do it!](https://www.berniepb.com/)

******


#[Text for Bernie](https://berniesanders.com/text/)

Another important thing you can do from home is to text people to get out the vote. 

It's super easy.  You get a list of Bernie supporters and you text reminders to get to the polls. Many have already voted which means you take them off the list so you and the other texters can keep reaching out to those who haven't voted for Bernie yet.

#Spread the Bern

This is about a show of force. People like to vote for someone who can win. Projecting strength and support makes us even stronger. 

Everyone should wear Bernie gear, everywhere. Put up a banner. Make your car a Bernie Mobile. Decorate your dog. Pass out literature on your own. Set up a Bernie table on your front lawn, at your university, anywhere.


******

#Provide rides to the polls and other support for voters

There may be long lines, broken machines, changed polling sites.  If you hear about problems like this go to the place - pass out water and snacks, entertain people in the lines. Advise people who show up at the closed sites where the new sites are. Be nimble and smart and find ways to make the best of the situation for the voters. 

*****

#Offer to Help another Berner do any of the above

If for some reason you really can't canvass, go to a field office, make calls, text or otherwise get the word out about Bernie then you can still help by assisting someone who can.  Volunteers can stay longer and be more effective if they aren't concerned about missing work or caring for family and other responsibilities. 

Offer your help to Berners who need help with rides, childcare, errands, or any other responsibilities that might keep them from volunteering for Bernie and being able to stay longer and work harder.",2,1583587473,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fev2u1/early_voting_right_now_in_arizona_florida_georgia/,OurPresident,1

I remember back when he was the Onion character of 2009 to 2016.

Bernie Sanders endorsed Rev. Jesse Jackson for president in 1988, and helped him win the state of Vermont. He's with Jesse Jackson and not Obama, not because of racism, but because Jesse Jackson is progressive like Bernie whereas Obama is more moderate. It has nothing to do with racism but everything to do with policies.

fejfim,wherethewavebroke,A message for the Bernie supporters who are angry and lashing out,"Let me first say this: you have every right to be angry. Establishment democrats are using every tactic they know to keep Bernie from getting the nomination, and Warren's reluctance to endorse him is frustrating.

When you see voters parroting these talking points and using strawmen or falsehoods to decry Bernie, it's extremely tempting to tell them just how wrong they are.

However, one thing we all need to remember is that *feelings do matter*. Humans are illogical beings that make decisions based on feelings and narratives. Telling someone how stupid and wrong they are for supporting x candidate or having concerns about Bernie will push them away and actively hurt our movement. When your goal is to gain allies, being right doesn't give you an excuse to be an asshole.

The term that's commonly used by leftists to describe this idea is called ""deactivation."" When someone is scorned or publically embarassed, they shut down and are no longer willing to change their views. Proving that you're right from an objective standpoint isn't worth deactivating potential allies.

I'm an anarchist, and I could scream about how capitalism and hierarchy are what's really killing us until I'm out of breath, but it wouldn't convince anyone, and would probably make me seem unhinged. That's what current angry Bernie supporters seem like to other democratic voters.

When you feel like you want to scream at someone, just try to remember the stakes at play. Under Trump, the working class will remain at its most vulnerable, working 60hr weeks and dying from preventable illnesses. Immigrant children will stay in cages and the US nationalist/fascist movement will continue to grow. This even goes beyond Bernie; the followers he gains now will have woken up to how flawed the system is, and will continue to criticize it from a progressive perspective, regardless of if Bernie wins or not. This is the best chance we have to awaken class consciousness since the Civil Rights movement of the 60s.

I'll leave you all with a quote from the man who got me into leftism, Pat the Bunny:

He is calling for an end to cash bail, an end to private prisons, an end to the drug war, and legalization of marijuana.

feij7b,trivialgroup,"This myth that ""Warren split the progressive vote"" has got to die. It's wrong and it only hurts Bernie.","I'm a Warren supporter. Bernie has always been my second choice, by a long shot, and now he has my support. But I have to say, it's been grating to see so many Bernie supporters complain that Warren was somehow splitting the progressive vote, causing Bernie to lose votes relative to the moderates. That argument was used the prematurely call for Warren to drop out, and it's still being used to berate her. It's just wrong, and it needs to stop.

Let's look at the numbers. People making this argument have pointed to [this poll](https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/), which had Bernie as the second choice of Warren supporters by a wide margin. Sure, but here are the actual numbers:

* Sanders 40%, Biden 16%, Buttigieg 16%, Klobuchar 12%

So Bernie gets 40% of Warren supporters, but Biden, together with Buttigieg and Klobuchar, who have endorsed him, get a combined 44%. So just as much of the Warren vote goes to the moderates as goes to Sanders.

Yeah, that seems strange, given that Warren is much closer to Bernie on policy than any other candidate. But voters don't choose based on a list of policies. If they did, Bernie Sanders would be President right now and cruising toward re-election. So what gives? Well, I knocked on hundreds of doors for Warren over the last 6 months. Sure there were a lot of voters, who like me, had Warren and Bernie as their top two choices. But there were also a lot of Warren supporters who said they'd support anyone *but* Bernie. Several of these were women who were strongly behind Hillary in 2016 and believe (unfairly, in my view) that Bernie didn't support her enough then and caused her to lose to Trump. But every voter is different. Heck, last weekend I even talked to a voter who was undecided between Warren and *Bloomberg*.

So no, Warren didn't split the progressive vote by staying in the race, and didn't hurt Bernie's chances vs. Biden. Continuing to push this myth and blame Warren only alienates her supporters. It's up to *you* to win them over. For my part, my state already voted, but my caucus is tomorrow, which starts the process of electing DNC delegates. It looks like Warren earned a few from my district, and I'm going to do what I can to ensure that they support Bernie in Milwaukee.

Update: [This poll](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-03/topline_reuters_2020_election_tracker_03_05_2020.pdf) confirms it. Second choices for Warren supporters are 47% Sanders, 46% Biden.",3,1583522214,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/feij7b/this_myth_that_warren_split_the_progressive_vote/,OurPresident,1

So no, Sarah Silverman, “Bernie or Bust” people on the convention floor weren’t “ridiculous”. They were asking the corrupt DNC and its Superdelegates to use their power to give Bernie the nomination, which they should have done.

feeum7,Rigjitsu,We need to highlight how disproportionately Biden and former candidates are being mentioned in broadcasts over Bernie.,"I drive 1 hour each way to work 5 days a week. Mostly I listen to NPR.  

As of today I’m starting to keep track of how many time a Democrat  presidential candidate’s name is mentioned on air. NPR mentioned Biden the most number of times with Warren getting a 2 minute piece speculating on why she  dropped out. Both were more positive sounding in delivery. One mention of Sanders campaigning in Michigan that focused more on Biden and a story that focused on Russia pumping favorable stories about Bernie to help him get the nomination. We need to change  the narrative in the media and fast. 

Keep a log of your time listening to the radio or watching news and tally each time a candidates name is spoken and then post it on all your social media. 

If we don't call them out, if we don't highlight the establishment bias then they'll keep suppressing voices.

[Many young voters sat out Super Tuesday, contributing to Bernie Sanders' losses ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/04/super-tuesday-bernie-sanders-youth-votes-fell-short-compared-2016/4947795002/)
Their conclusion doesn’t follow their math. In Virginia 2020, 13% of 1.3 million is 169,000 compared to 16% of 800,000 four years ago which was 128,00. Bernie won 69% of that 128,00 four years ago which is 88,000 and in 2020, 55% of that 169,000  which is about 93,000. So 5 thousand more young people in Virginia turned out for him this time than 4 years ago.
The amount of young people who showed out for him actually increased, certainly not by enough but the article is misleading.
The real story here is how older people disproportionately showed up to stop him, that is what is deflating millenials’ increased numbers.",2,1583505980,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/feefy0/the_lower_youth_turnout_narrative_is_misleading/,OurPresident,1

Biden is not a “lesser evil” than Trump, he’s just Trump 2.0 in disguise . The problem is, however, that nobody seems to understand that. If Biden were against the corporate elite, he would not be accepting money from 60+ billionaires. But Biden voters think he’s not like that. The only thing that will happen if Biden wins is that the corporate elite will simply win a lot of time, but his victory would be wrongly perceived as a victory for the working people. But if Trump wins, this will radicalize Biden’s voters, which will help unite the left and contribute to the arising of class consciousness, because if Biden gets nominated, it would be very improbable for trump to win, and this will inevitably radicalize the population, because everyone hates Trump. 

Bottom line : if Biden voters knew who he is , they would vote for Bernie, because Biden is just Trump 2.0 . But if Bernie supporters helped Trump win, this will turn almost the entire population against corporate America.",11,1583494325,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fec7ch/if_bernie_doesnt_get_nominated_vote_trump_read/,OurPresident,1

For example according to npr.com, California is missing 114 delegates and Colorado 26 Will they finish soon? Is there something relevant I dont know? Should I use better sources?

 I tought winning california would have put Bernie ahead of Biden and I hope it will do so, but I cant tell without all those delegates.

fe3ueg,Zennsworld,"Sanders can easily win this nomination, but we absolutely need to have the younger generation vote as much as the other generations are","Biden only has roughly 60 more delegates than Sanders, and a vast majority of the states haven't voted yet. We can crush this nomination, but we *have* to get the younger generation to vote. It's easy to get stuck in the Reddit echo chamber and figure Sanders will sweep every state regardless, but this is far from the truth. In Super Tuesday Biden won a lot more states than Sanders did, and he was a close second in the states Sanders won (splitting the delegates more in his favor).

I know the feeling of thinking your vote doesn't matter after constantly seeing disheartening news on the front page. This is a mentality that many members of the younger generation have, including myself until recently when I voted in Colorado. This is our chance to show that our vote does matter, a lot in fact. We've already seen that it matters: Colorado and California had some of the highest young voter turn out (albeit still low) out of all the Super Tuesday states, and Sanders won both.

Now is our chance to turn around the political system and fix a lot of the issues that discourage the younger generation to vote in the first place, but in order for us to accomplish this we all have to cast our vote instead of assuming Sanders is going to do well regardless. We can do this. We can show the country what the younger generation can really do, we just can't get stuck in the Reddit echo chamber.",4,1583449268,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fe3ueg/sanders_can_easily_win_this_nomination_but_we/,OurPresident,1

fe3ole,Ltrfsn,TIL why the USA is so messed up,"Post anywhere that you like Bernie Sanders and you get instant replies from MAGA folks who call him a socialist and then describe some historical consequences from failed stalinist communist regimes. I always wondered why people in the USA misunderstood the concept of socialism. 

Go anywhere BEYOND theUSA and make the realisation you can throw your English dictionary away. Here:

English (incorrect) definition of socialism:
""a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.""
Notice how this is literally the same definition as communism. How does that work if communism is a subsection of socialism?

Dutch definition of socialism translated to English:
""Socialism is a political form of society based on equality, social justice and solidarity, or the collective name for a variety of political and ideological movements that strive for such a society""

Bulgarian definition of socialism translated to English:
""The term socialism refers to a large group of theories about the organization of the economy and society, based on the active interference of the state in the economy and social relations, the protection of the interests of workers, or the important role of public property and the management of the means of production and distribution of goods. The term also refers to a society characterized by free and equal access to resources for the individual, with egalitarian methods of compensation.""

German definition translated to English:
""Collective term for a number of models of society and teachings to their achievement that have arisen since the end of the 18th century., With the aim of a social order in which equality, solidarity and justice between all human beings is assured, the criticized individualistic liberal rather than a market economy to erect. The type and scope of the intended transformation as well as the way to implement it differ considerably depending on the socialist school."" 
They give a second definition as ""Name for social systems that (referring to the Marxist philosophy of history) are, according to the understanding of the ruling parties, on the stage of development between capitalism and communism.""

I can go on and on. Communism does not equal the overarching main subject of socialism. Communism is a subchapter of socialism. European socialist parties are not communist.

I now understand why the USA is so messed up. Imagine thinking helping your unfortunate fellow human beings through social systems is the same thing as Stalins mass murders! No wonder. This is why Bernie is being attacked so harshly about being a socialist.",13,1583448604,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fe3ole/til_why_the_usa_is_so_messed_up/,OurPresident,1

fe2fx9,Baloney-Os,If Biden wins the nomination the working class will be (even more) OBLITERATED,"This is probably obvious to many people on this sub but imagine if Dementia Joe gets the nomination.

If  somehow Biden beats Trump, dem voters will be known to vote for someone  exhibiting neurodegenerative brain issues in broad daylight. We'd be  stooping to the level of republicans voting in a dictator wannabe in  terms of harming US politics. All this isn't even getting into the  presidency itself.

If Trump gets  another 4 years we'll continue to be fucked by anti-progressive policies  and we'll be lucky to still have real voting by 2024. This year may be  our last chance to stand up to the conservative group of the US who just  want poor people to die to the point where they'd engage in mass voter  suppression.

I've  seen pointers on how the DNC is abusing Biden's disabled elder status  and after seeing his dementia in action I must agree. At times I suspect  that the older demographic is voting for him in part because they  personally relate to his ""gaffes"".

Young  people largely outnumber the old. If we don't go out and vote like our  lives depended on it, it's going to be catastrophic future.

TL;DR: Biden is *objectively*  unfit for office. If he wins the nomination the working class will  suffer a historically impactful loss by being cornered into a lose-lose  situation.",4,1583443669,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fe2fx9/if_biden_wins_the_nomination_the_working_class/,OurPresident,1

fe27j4,kOan__,Sanders should capitalize on the awful handling of COVID19 by the current administration.,"I do not typically follow American politics, and although I have not gone through the exercise of introspection / understanding where in the left-to-right spectrum I fit in when it comes to fiscal or social policy, I can say that when I've heard Sanders speak he is often coherent and many things he says resonate with me.

Because of that I come to your subreddit to suggest an area where the Trump administration's flaws have been (and will continue to be) laid bare, and I'm not seeing any other candidates be firm/coherent with this serious issue:

- It is not acceptable for the leader of the free world to politicize a pandemic. It should be his/her focus to deal with the consequences.

- It is irresponsible to call the WHO's reported mortality rate (3.4%) false, and to report a 'hunch' (of &lt;1%) to be more reliable instead.

- It is false to report that the seasonal flu is a more severe disease. As per the WHO and CDC's estimates, COVID19 is estimated to be 30x worse.

- It is irresponsible to suggest the virus will die down in the summer. Experts are not so sure.

- It is irresponsible to suggest people should continue to attend work, and that a side effect of that may be recovery from COVID19.

I would urge him to speak at length about the issue (or if he already has, if you could direct me to the reading material that would be great).",2,1583442800,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fe27j4/sanders_should_capitalize_on_the_awful_handling/,OurPresident,1

fe1ae2,ksmaer,A call to make calls!,"As someone who made calls for Bernie in 2016 but hasn’t been involved in 2020, I am calling for other Bernie supporters like me to wake up and take action. This is a call to arms! Or, perhaps more precisely, a call to make calls!

For me, I now realize the lack of drive to get involved this cycle has been largely due to the presence of other good candidates in the race (or, at least one other good one). I was not Bernie or Bust. I felt Liz would’ve made a great candidate. I assume many of you have felt this way, too.

But now, it is just Biden. Bernie vs. Biden. And knowing that, I’m more confident than ever that Bernie is the best candidate for the Democratic Nomination. He is the most likely to beat Trump and would make the best president. But I think you all know this already. It is crystal clear to all of us. And now we must turn that clarity into action.

It is time to put our money (or time and energy) where our mouth is. You think Biden will suck in the general election? Great, so do I. That is why I am calling for every one of us who aren’t already involved in helping Bernie, to get involved by hitting the phone lines. This is our last chance. Let’s not fool ourselves, this primary could be essentially decided on Tuesday if Bernie underperforms. And that, my friends, is why we must act now.

Let’s pick up the phones and remind the voters of Michigan and beyond who their best choice is. Who their only choice is. Who America’s only hope is. Let’s get back to what we did so well back in 2016. Let’s make Bernie Sanders the next president of the United States of America.

fe0m5h,Gypsylee333,"Don't despair my friends! The last few days have totally changed the race, but I have some reasons why they might actually be good for Bernie! Hear me out...","1) Some are acting like it's over for bernie, when the delegate count is pretty close. One middle sized state difference, with lots of upcoming states, so it's still anyone's game.

 2) It's down to just 2 people now, which makes a contested convention with superdelegates much less likely. With only 2 people, it's easier for someone to get 50% of the delegates. We can relax a bit on that front which is huge, as it looked like the DNC was going to override Bernie if he was the leader but under 50%.

3) Bloomberg and all his money have proven that money only takes you so far. His billions and establishment support were a huge threat. I was really scared at even the chance he could be president, he would be worse than Trump. He's now out of the race.

4) Buttigieg was the one who could have put up a competent defense and attacks of Bernie, was handsome and young and had establishment support. He's now out.

5) Warren was splitting the progressive vote and talking trash on Bernie a lot. I suspect 60% of her supporters will back Bernie now that she's out too.

6) Biden is falling apart mentally, who knows how long he can keep it together with all eyes on him. I don't think very long. Still betting on Joe to have some really bad public gaffs that make everyone question if he's gone senile already or could handle an election and 8 years of presidency. No one has drawn a lot of attention to it because they feel bad for him and hoped they wouldn't have to, but the time has come, that point needs to be made somehow. It will be easy point to make to voters concerned about electability over policy, so make that argument in a nice way guys.

7) All the Bernie Bros can focus on Joe now, we've had to switch from joe to Warren to Pete to Bloomberg and divide our attention. 

8) We were beating joe before so it can be done again.

9) Trump has said now that Mike is out he has his sights set on bringing down Joe next. Maybe the republicans will give us an assist and make the nasty attacks for us. He hasn't really gone after bernie yet, so if that keeps up, we can just focus on Joe and not have to defend against Trump at the same time. (I have a theory about this if you guys want to hear a kooky theory)

The biggest hurdle is these next few states because they're up before Biden and bernie debate head to head, and we don't have much time to change our strategy and focus attacks. If Biden has a strong win that day the momentum will be harder to beat. 

So we had a day to lick our wounds, now it's time to fight with all you've got, the next few days are crucial. Although even if we're down after the this next group of states, then they will have a one on one debate that could tank Joe the way Warren tanked Bloomberg. Then things could turn around strongly for the rest of the states. We've had a lot of ups and downs and changes already, we can easily come back from this.

Stay strong and keep fighting 💪 this was never going to be an easy fight, we're up against the whole machine and we will have to keep fighting even if Bernie wins the presidency.",17,1583436790,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fe0m5h/dont_despair_my_friends_the_last_few_days_have/,OurPresident,1

Still, Super Tuesday has me feeling like we can’t sit back and gotta go WIN this. Here’s my questions:

1. Does anyone know any good phone bank locations in Oakland or Berkeley?

2. Anything I should know? I did some phone banks before, but idk if there’s something I should know (we focused more on in person voter outreach)

3. What states are we calling? Certain places more/less than others? 

4. Are we calling Guam and PR at all, or not because they don’t vote in the general (which is bs)? I know for one that my friends back in PR are almost ALL Bernie supporters, and I think Bernie actually cares about the islands so I think they could be receptive to his ideas.

fdzuzv,FentoBox,"Reminder: Keep volunteering, keep advocating, and keep positive","I just wanted to say that you all are doing an amazing job at making an active community in full support of Bernie Sanders. It’s becoming even more important that we keep our best foot forward in this stretch before the nomination.

1.	Don’t use language that targets the supporter. 
2.	Remain positive. Positivity encourages discussion, understanding, and acceptance. 
3.	Keep up your amazing efforts like vocalizing your support, volunteering, and donating!

It’s absolutely normal to get frustrated, but positivity and negativity are *both* infectious which is why it’s so important to have either positive discussion or neutral discussion. 

It hurts to see shaming of someone’s choice of a candidate. A LOT of media is biased and people’s communities are biased, it shouldn’t reflect poorly on the supporter if they don’t know everything on every policy or dimension of the candidates persona. There is likely just a few issues that matter most to the candidate and that’s where the most healthy discussion comes from.
Electability? Okay, let’s talk about that. 
Equal rights stances and consistency? Okay, let’s talk about that.
Healthcare? Hell yeah, let’s talk about that.
Tax rates? Let’s talk about that!

I was speaking with a conservative friend in depth about why I feel the up-front and long-term value of Bernie’s policies is more important than the cost, and it did a lot to help me understand the rhetoric behind his stance. In addition, that discussion made me better equipped to communicate to others with similar views and which studies I could use to support those claims. People won’t always be that receptive but we won’t know until we talk. 

Welcome to all the new and old Bernie supporters and welcome to all other candidate supporters! I really hope together we can build a community that exemplifies positive enthusiasm in support of who we feel is the best choice for President of the United States.",4,1583433882,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdzuzv/reminder_keep_volunteering_keep_advocating_and/,OurPresident,1

fdx4wy,vrael2,We need a reality check: Bernie and Biden are ultimately on the same side,"Sanders supporters, myself included, have been saying ""vote blue no matter who"" for a while now. It's been easy to do in the early days of the race when Bernie has stood out among the competition. But nothing up to this point is as important as the primaries, and on the biggest day for these elections we failed to show up.

After a forgettable performance for so long, we forgot what's been true from the beginning: Biden is more likely than anyone else to win the nomination. Not just because he was VP to a very popular president, but because his voters actually showed up on Super Tuesday. Older citizens are more likely to vote than younger ones: It's just a fact, and Biden has the older crowd while Bernie has the younger.

Young Democrats need to get our shit together. If we want Bernie we have to prove it. If we want to kick Trump out we have to prove it. But with our performance so far, we might not get both. We need to recognize that reality and act. 



NECESSARY STEPS FOR ALL BERNIE SUPPORTERS:

1) If you haven't yet, register to vote. Do it today. It's fast and easy.

2) If you are a college student living away from home, get an absentee ballot ASAP. Fill it out and mail it in. No, you are not too busy. 

3) For everyone else, when your state's primary rolls around, vote. There's no excuses here. If you don't vote in the primaries you are not supporting Bernie. 

4) Accept the possibility of Biden winning the nomination. This means no more comparing him to Trump, no more calling him a fascist. Both claims are completely unfounded and unacceptable. When we talk about why we choose Bernie, we need to better than that. If we want those outside the core supporters to vote Bernie, we need to be better than that. 

5) This november, put your money where your mouth is and vote blue no matter who. If we support Bernie now, during the primaries, we get him. If we don't, we get Biden. But either way, remember that the real opposition is Donald Trump.



Our Super Tuesday turnout has proven we can't afford to disregard Biden. If he wins the nomination, and we place Biden on the same level as Trump, Trump is going to be president another four years. 

Don't forget Russia is actively spreading disinformation and discord among Americans to help Trump. When you hear someone asking if Biden is any better than Trump, understand that this mindset will suppress the democratic youth vote in the event of a Biden nomination.

Vote for Bernie now, as soon as you can. But remember the bigger picture. Bernie and Biden are united in wanting to remove the worst president in the history of the United States. This November, VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO.",17,1583423340,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdx4wy/we_need_a_reality_check_bernie_and_biden_are/,OurPresident,1

fdvuue,endthiskakistocracy,Persuasion Playbook Part 1: The Need For Stronger Messaging,"**Key Points**

* The mainstream media is a private industry made up of corporations whose owners care more about profits than about us.
* Bernie wants to reverse tax cuts for the rich.
* Predictably, the mainstream media manufactures false narratives (""unelectable"", ""can't get things done"", ""toxic Bernie Bros"", ""too radical"", etc), spins pro-Bernie news to be negative, and does everything to censor/disparage Bernie to turn voters away from him, so they can protect their profits.
* When media personalities say ""the economy will be ruined by these government programs"", it's really just their bosses not wanting to pay their fair share of taxes. These talking heads would not be employed in these positions if their beliefs did not conform with the elites' views.
* We can continuously bomb middle eastern countries with billion-dollar weapons, give subsidies to fossil fuel companies, bail out Wall Street when their gambles fail, yet somehow we can't invest in the future of everyday Americans?
* Bernie's ideas are not radical at all. Take universal healthcare for example. Most Americans want it. Canada has it. The UK has it. Singapore has it. Japan has it. And yet somehow, we can't have it because it's ""socialist""?
* That's what they want us to think because that way of thinking benefits them, not us. 
* With the mainstream media mostly against Bernie, our campaign faces a massive disadvantage in terms of reach. The unprecedented grassroots organization and volunteer army behind him makes up for this disadvantage. We're growing everyday, but our strength has yet to match the absolute power of the media, in cahoots with big money groups and the political establishment (who collectively stand to make a bit less profit under a Sanders presidency).
* Therefore, we need to grow even faster than we're doing now. To do this, we need much stronger messaging that really gets through to people who are not already on-board.
* We can start by exposing the anti-Bernie bias of the media, and explaining *why* they have that bias. See the above points for the explanation.
* It's not enough to point out that ""the media, the establishment, the corporate elites don't want us to win."" **The** ***why*** **is more important.**
* While anecdotal, this line of argumentation is extremely effective from my experience online. Post creative content on all major websites: Reddit, Twitter, Youtube, Facebook, etc. pointing this out. Bernie supporters and canvassers should tell this to the people they're trying to convince. Inform your friends, family, neighbors, classmates, coworkers. Bernie himself has to spell this out at some point. We need to spread it far and wide.
* Do not hesitate to bring this up to every person you can get. Especially to people who are ""avoiding politics"". We need to plant the seeds of doubt in the minds of *everyone*.
* This will make people question their assumptions about Bernie, and they can turn towards less biased sources of information. The more they find out about him, the more they will like him. His record of integrity, courage, and compassion spanning decades speaks for itself.
* The mainstream media won't explicitly contrast Biden's record with Bernie's fantastic record over the decades. They will not show Biden's record on busing, Glass-Steagall, the Iraq War, DOMA, the bankruptcy bill, and the Patriot Act. They will not show his frequent gaffes and untoward behavior with girls. **We have to do it ourselves.**
* Perhaps more importantly, this will make people question their over-reliance on a few news sources. Diversifying our sources keeps us more informed. An informed populace is essential to a functioning democracy.
* Debunking the individual narratives manufactured by the corporate media is very important in further exposing their bias, and we will do that. I will write about them in later parts of this series (this is Part 1).
* The play would go as follows: Debunk media myth -&gt; Expose media bias and disinformation campaigns -&gt; Explain why this happens -&gt; Sway them to our cause
* We're onto them. We know their game. They're trying to trick us into voting against our own interests. But it won't work if we awaken everyone to this reality.
* This is how we win.

# Introduction

I am not American, but I feel like I am part of this movement. Bernie is the most inspiring candidate in my lifetime and he has given me hope amidst my descent into cynicism. The past few years have been a quagmire of post-truth politics and  authoritarianism and laughable incompetence and bigotry and cynicism and  shameless disregard for the planet's future in favor of short-term  profits.

I want to save the planet from further environmental exploitation, and I want to live in a kinder, more accepting, more compassionate world. With Bernie at the helm of the most powerful country, perhaps we can make that a reality. I've  never looked forward to any election as much as this one, and I can' t  even vote in it! (Again, not American) Don't mess this up please. The  rest of the world is watching.

The above Key Points section was initially supposed to be a TL;DR of what I wanted to say, but it can stand well enough on its own. For each part of this series that I intend to (hopefully) write, you can read the Key Points section and skip the rest. I don't want impenetrable walls of text and long paragraphs. We need solid talking points that get to the heart of issues -- ones that can successfully convince people.

The rest of these write-ups will expand on the key points and provide supplemental links and sources. I will adopt a language as though I were American so you can just copy-paste to reply to someone. Please do not hesitate to do so, and don't bother crediting me. Convincing people is the top priority right now, and as more primary contests loom in the horizon, we need to start as soon as we can. Participate in discussions and debates, online and offline. That is the only way we will beat the anti-Bernie airwaves.

# The Role Of Mainstream Media - Manufacturing Consent

[Six corporations own 90% of the media.](https://i.insider.com/4fd9ee1e6bb3f7af5700000a?width=1000&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp) This means that very few people control the information flow to and from the vast majority of Americans' minds. This allows them to control the broad public consensus on many important issues. Unsurprisingly, the consensus they try to push will always align with the interests of the rich who own them.

**So many things make  sense when we realize that corporate media serves not as an instrument  of finding truth, but as a propaganda outlet subservient to the  needs and interests of the elite.**

In the 1988 book ""[Manufacturing Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent)"" by Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky, the authors lay out a propaganda model that exposes the mechanism by which the media selectively favors and suppresses certain narratives. According to this model, there are five different ""filters"" that effectively constrain the narratives and stories the media is allowed to publish. The filters are as follows:

* **Ownership:** News stories that go against the interests and profits of the owners of news corporations are heavily suppressed.
* **Advertising:** The high expenses associated with running a mass media firm means that they need to please advertisers to be commercially viable.
* **Sourcing or Media Elite:** Media journalists must be careful to preserve their privileged access to the people in prominent institutions -- like government agencies and corporations -- who are generally regarded as ""authorities"" or ""experts"".
* **Flak:** Broadcasting that goes against the narrative favored by the elites will be subjected to ""flak"" in the form of letters, complaints, lawsuits, or legislative actions.
* **Anti-Communism or more generally, the Common Enemy:** Media will try to force a consensus by invoking fear and contempt for a ""common enemy"", and any positive portrayal of these entities will be avoided.

It's a phenomenally eye-opening book. I strongly recommend it if you have the time. If you don't, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34LGPIXvU5M) gives the gist of the propaganda model.

A notable example:

Remember the Iraq War of 2003? [The media played a significant role in shaping public opinion to support the invasion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_coverage_of_the_Iraq_War) 71% of the coverage in American media was pro-war, and only 3% was against. The rest (26%) was neutral. They put forward false narratives about [Weapons of Mass Destruction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/22/iraq-war-wmds-an-intelligence-failure-or-white-house-spin/) and [Iraqi soldiers killing babies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony). They stoked the fires of patriotism and ""bringing freedom"". The consent of the American people was manufactured.

And who benefited from the war? Not the brave working class Americans who lost their limbs, their friends, and their lives. Certainly not the hundreds of thousands (some estimates reach millions) of innocent Iraqi civilians who got killed and millions more who were displaced. It's never the billionaires' children who die in wars. No, all they got was some good money from the [weapons sales](https://www.ft.com/content/7f435f04-8c05-11e2-b001-00144feabdc0), the [oil they appropriated](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/20/iraq-war-oil-resources-energy-peak-scarcity-economy), and significant boosts to tv ratings.

Meanwhile, [this guy led the opposition to that war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_om-x323Em0), bravely standing against all the corporate bloodlust. And guess what? Everyone is now retroactively in agreement with the position he championed. On the right side of history yet again.

# Media Coverage Of Bernie 2020

**Recent examples of anti-Bernie bias:**

[Bernie Gets Less MSNBC Coverage Than Klobuchar Despite Polling 7x Higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9tnDuqJu2o&amp;feature=emb_title)

[""Accidentally"" flipping the polling numbers so Bernie's not in the lead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bernieblindness/comments/dqjsmg/cnn_flipping_bernie_and_warrens_polling_numbers/)

[Who is this ""Other"", who seems to be in the lead?](https://www.reddit.com/r/bernieblindness/comments/erjfom/poll_list_bernie_as_other/)

**Commentary on this phenomenon:**

[7 Ways The Media Sure Is Freaking Out About Bernie Sanders - SOME MORE NEWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmBHwjoIFNM)

[Bernie Sanders’ Rise Prompts Media Meltdown, Establishment Panic: A Closer Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjj7VJpqy1w)

&amp;#x200B;

The subreddit r/BernieBlindness is a goldmine for Bernie censorship and hostile coverage by the media. When you see that many examples, it is impossible to conclude that they are mere ""accidents"". When these ""innocent mistakes"" always work against Bernie, it is only rational to think that there is a systemic institutional bias against him. The propaganda model perfectly explains that behavior.

**The Five filters in action:**

* **Ownership:** Bernie will tax the rich so corporate media will make sure they turn voters against him. Journalists working for these corporations either have views tolerable to the owners or are avoiding offending their bosses.
* **Advertising:** Similar to ownership. Greedy corporations would be opposed to Bernie for the exact same reason as above: reversing tax breaks. So they will avoid media firms that portray Bernie positively.
* **Sourcing or Media Elite:** Media journalists will make sure to mostly invite pundits and ""experts"" that have negative views of Bernie. They will invite just enough pro-Bernie guests to maintain the appearance of ""neutrality"", but they will nonetheless be heavily prejudiced against these guests' views. Prominent establishment members will say things like ""nobody likes Bernie"" even though he has the [highest favorability ratings](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-sanders-gallup-favorability-democrats-2020-1450344) of all the candidates.
* **Flak:** Big Money groups like Big Pharma, the health insurance industry, the fossil fuel industry, the NRA, Facebook, the prison-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, and multinational corporations, etc (goddamn our opposition is powerful) will fund SuperPACs to launch negative ads on tv and even full-blown disinformation campaigns on social media.
* **Anti-Communism or more generally, the Common Enemy:** This one's easy. ""Bernie is a communist"", ""he's too radical"", ""he honeymooned in the Soviet Union"", ""he praised Fidel Castro"", ""he will turn us into Venezuela"".

&amp;#x200B;

That is what we're up against. Our opposition seems overwhelming. All the powers that be are heavily invested in the status quo where millions are suffering while they're getting richer and richer.

We did not anticipate the degree to which they're willing to throw everything against us by having two decently strong candidates drop out just before Super Tuesday, then having the billionaire drop out as well to support the new centrist frontrunner. Meanwhile, the progressive vote continues to be split.

But consider what happened: they've shot their shot and yet it's still neck and neck. They threw everything they had, and that was not enough to stop us. We're not new to this. We were never gonna be a normal campaign. We are a movement. We organize and spread the word ourselves because the media won't do us any favors. And now, we can adopt more powerful rhetoric to spread the word by inoculating people against media bias. Let's do it!

Frontrunner status comes and goes as the race heats up. Over the past year, Bernie has beaten seemingly insurmountable odds as he gradually chipped away at the other candidates' leads and came out on top. He can do it again. The field has narrowed, the establishment has played its hand, while our movement is stronger than ever.",1,1583417808,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdvuue/persuasion_playbook_part_1_the_need_for_stronger/,OurPresident,1

I was torn, and wrapped up in that sentiment....is Biden our only chance at defeating Trump? Well, I woke up today and saw a news piece where a conservative Republican pundit made a show of voting for Biden for the first time in a Democratic primary, in Virginia. I thought, crap maybe they are right....THEN THE GUY OPENLY ADMITTED THAT WOULD ONLY BE VOTING IN THE PRIMARY. He had no intention of voting in the general election. People voted in this primary to avoid a Sanders presidency, not to avoid another Trump term in office. Sanders supporters are sensible, not irrational. We are doing the right thing by sticking with the only candidate in this race who says “Not me, us!” The consequences of a Sanders candidacy cannot be weighed in their current state, they must be weighed only if and when we have one.

fdt8hr,RespectableCafe,"How to win the democratic primary: Stop the attacks, Start listening.","**I understand why some of us get aggressive when defending the movement. It's a matter of life or death.** Healthcare. The Climate Crisis. Endless Wars. Working three jobs to pay off your student debt.

Then someone comes along and defends the status quo. How dare they? They must be evil? or stupid? a republican in disguise? **Imagine for a moment what they might be feeling.** They're scared. They're terrified of what 4 more years of Trump will look like. Too busy working three jobs to pay attention to politics. They spent their whole life struggling to get the status quo to work for them. They have children, dependents, and they can't afford to take a risk.

**Maybe they don't want to join a movement that thinks they're evil and stupid?** They put their heart and soul into their candidate. They're not going to join a group of people who now say their  candidate is: a traitor, a creep, a fake progressive, a spoiler candidate, a stupid choice, not gay enough, not straight enough, not likeable, not presidential.

**Nobody ever convinced anyone of anything by attacking them.** Think back to the last time you were on the wrong side of an argument. Did you suddenly change your mind? Did you, in the heat of the moment, admit that you were wrong and they were right? Of course not. Nobody does that. If you want to convince someone to change their stance, here's how:

**Find shared values and experiences. Listen. Then listen some more. Talk about the things you agree on. Talk about why you're scared. Listen some more. Talk about why you support a policy that would benefit you both. Talk about why you're voting for Bernie.**

**Tell them, no matter what the result, you're going to keep on fighting for them.**

**---**

The mockery of others is seriously damaging the movement. So many people do not want to join.

fdsr7r,ClixxGuardian,Question: want to know how to approach a troubled friend regarding the Hilary/Sanders healthcare '94 issue,"Hey all,

Big senator Sanders supporter. My vote is coming up here in Washington soon and I've already secured my vote, but today I was presented with a very upset friend. See, they read this article that claims that in '94 that when Hillary was pushing for wider healthcare, that senator Sanders (while present), was there to vote for universal single payer, not expanded employer like Hillary was pushing for. My friend claims that she feels betrayed because she could have been insured sooner if senator Sanders supported Hillary's plan instead of stonewalling for his. After reading the information (and the source because I'm always checking), I'm not sure how to respond.

How would you inform or approach my upset friend to help them still support senator Sanders?

However, I’d like an articulate breakdown of the pros and cons of both so I can sit down with him and hash out the differences between the two candidates. Can anyone suggest a video or text that might suffice? 

I was hoping Kyle Kulinski, David Pakman or Jimmy Dore might have a video dedicated to why they like Bernie over Biden but it’s not always that black and white and I can only find clips here and there.

fdrl6t,attosama,"How do we properly communicate our issues with Biden, without being called bullies?","This is infuriating, how do we as Bernie supporters point out the fatal flaws of the other candidates without being called bullies?

It's maddening to watch moderates critise Trump over his behavior towards women, but entirely ignore ample footage of Biden smelling girls in broad daylight and grabbing their faces or waists. Say what you will about Trump, there is zero footage of him touching women inappropriately, even despite his statement in the trailer with a Bush...


It also seems like there's this absurd idea that if we don't talk about a candidates flaws, Trump won't use them in the General...? That's not the purpose of vetting, the point is to get all this shit out in the open before it hits the fan, so we can AVOID a fatally flawed candidate being cannibalized in the General. Trump already knows Biden's issues, all he does is watch Fox and read Twitter 🤦‍♂️

But Bernie is right, we need to better communicate our concerns, and tone back the insults. So I ask again, how do I communicate that I think nominating someone with an obscene political record, with ample footage of him smelling little girls... is a **really really bad idea**, without being excused of being bully?

fdr5ja,DFSQuestions,We're right there.,"I just thought I would leave some thoughts here just because I've been seeing a lot of ""well if Joe gets the nominee then the world is over"" posts. I'm not here to say anything about Joe Biden's policy or his efficacy as a candidate against Trump. 

I'm here to talk about us. 

We are only 3.27% behind Biden in the race to 1991 delegates (or just 65 shy). To put it in attainable goals we need 1490 delegates to get the nomination outright, and Biden needs 1425. (This is not including the 284 delegates yet to be awarded. 145 of which are coming from CA.) 

&amp;#x200B;

There are 2480 left in the upcoming primaries and caucuses. Of which there are 365 next week (including 125 in the incredibly important MI swing state); followed by 577 the week after (including 355 from swing states FL: 219, and OH: 136.)

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously we know this will be difficult. But it won't just be difficult for us. It will also be difficult for them. We are hitting battleground states where if either Bernie or Biden don't come out ahead either's chance in the general would be slim. 

It is (obviously) monumentally important that we connect with voters of all types of backgrounds in these next two bids and help these constituents feel heard. A lot of these states have an electorate that are hurting, let's do our best to inform those that don't know on Bernie's issues and at this point above all us, represent him in the best possible light. People vote with their hearts. Let's get on those phones and/or go out in those neighborhoods and show them that we care about them too; and when it's our time: Vote.",3,1583389559,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdr5ja/were_right_there/,OurPresident,1

fdqmr8,pkelliher98,Bernie Sanders would be more than just a President,"When people told me they hated Bernie Sanders or (far worse) that they were ""not fans,"" I wish I had said in no uncertain terms: ""I love Bernie. I am in awe of him. I am set free by him. He will be the finest world leader our country has ever seen.""

I wish, in those exchanges, I had not asked gentle, tolerant questions about a hater's ridiculous allergy to him, or Bernie’s fictional misdeeds and imagined character flaws. More deeply still, I wish I had not reasoned with anyone, patiently countered their ludicrous emotionalism and psychologically disturbed theories. I wish I had said, flatly, ""I love him."" As if I had been asked about my mother or daughter. No defensiveness or polemics; not dignifying the crazy allegations with so much as a Snopes link.

Maybe ""I love him"" seemed too manly, too sentimental, too un-pragmatic. Not coalition-building, kind of culty. But people say with impunity they love Obama, the state of Israel, their churches, Kurt Cobain. In the end, I wish I'd said it because it's true.

And I'm not alone in my commitment. Millions of Bernie’s supporters — we were thanked by Bernie as the ""secret, private Facebook sites"" — expressed it among themselves, all the time, in raptures or happy tears with each new display of our hero's ferocious intelligence, depth, and courage. We were frankly bewildered by the idea that anyone would hedge their commitment to him (""You don't have to be his friend""; ""Yes, he's made mistakes""; ""lesser of two evils""). We didn't remember anyone turning to this stock ambivalence when discussing Obama, Babe Ruth, FDR. If only one reporter — they knew about us — could have published a headline like “Sanders Inspires Historic Levels of Adoration From His Supporters"" about the people who have had their lives transformed by the power of his brilliant campaign, unrivaled effectiveness, and extraordinary career. Just one headline like that, like the ones Bill Clinton got.

Usually a legend is made by men and media — the legend of Kennedy, say, or Kobe Bryant — and then, much later, a biopic, pretending to evenhandedness, reveals the legend's shortcomings, his ""human"" side. The shortcomings are almost always something exactly no one actually believes compromises his heroism. His problem drinking. His mistreatment of women. Well, takedowns of Bernie were always already written. He has somehow made the time to hear out each dead-end line of reasoning about his fake mortal sins, and often he has also thanked everyone for sparing him further moral lashings, as if that were a kindness. Under cover of ""humanizing"" the intimidating valedictorian, reports and investigations and media clichés vilified him. But the almighty hero never got to be a legend first. And yet he is one, easily surpassing Ben Franklin, Henry Ford, Steve Jobs.

I want to reverse the usual schedule of things, then. We don't have to wait until he dies to act. Bernie Sanders name belongs on ships, and airports, and tattoos. He deserves straight-up hagiographies and a sold-out Broadway show called DEL. Yes, this cultural canonization is going to come after the chronic, constant, nonstop ""On the other hand"" hedging around his legacy. But such is the courage of Bernie Sanders and his supporters; we reverse patriarchal orders. Maybe he is more than a president. Maybe he is an idea, a world-historical hero, light itself. The presidency is too small for him. He belongs to a much more elite class of Americans, the more-than-presidents. Neil Armstrong, Martin Luther King Jr., Alexander Fucking Hamilton.

Bernie has done everything right in this campaign, and he won more votes than his opponents did in the first 3 states. He won. He cannot be faulted, criticized, or analyzed for even one more second. Instead, he will be decorated as an epochal hero far too extraordinary to be contained by the mere White House. Let that revolting president-elect be Millard Fillmore or Herbert Hoover or whatever.

&gt; Bernie Supporter here, I donated and will be voting for him on the 17th..

&gt; I feel your pain and disdain for the establishment and the current President, his administration and the GOP as a whole, not to mention their horrendous policies. He &amp; they must be removed any way possible and it appears the only way is via the ballot box. If we had a Senate Democrat majority the Impeachment Trial would have had a whole different outcome.

&gt; I'm not asking or telling potential non-voters to vote for someone other than Bernie. But take a second and consider, should Bernie for whatever reason, not be the Democrat Presidential candidate for President, a non-vote will in fact be a net positive vote for The current President and all of his policies that follow.

&gt; Just think about that for a while and consider the ramifications of not voting. Also, if they are 'cooking the books' so to speak, make them steal it and hope for justice for those actions down the road.

&gt; Also, to add, there is a lot more at stake than just a Presidential vote. We have a House of Rep's to keep and a Senate to flip and your local elections are just as important as the big one.

&gt; So please, I beg of anyone to please re-consider your thoughts about not voting. Because the more we do not participate in our democracy and casting our ballot, the more likely that may not be our right or option in the future the way the establishment appears to be headed. They despise the fact you still have a right to vote and will stop at nothing to prevent or remove that option. (e.g. Gerrymandering, voter suppression, faulty equipment etc etc etc)

&gt; Please reconsider your stance on not voting and the repercussions that it would contribute to. Like you, I sure hope and pray we're not forced to yet again, vote for the better of the two worst candidates like we had to in 2016.

People have sacrificed their lives to guarantee our freedoms including and most importantly, our right to vote. It is not only our responsibility, but it's the least sacrifice we can make in shaping our future governance. I'm not asking/telling anyone who to vote for, just simply vote before you won't have the privilege or right to in the future.",19,1583385697,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdqgko/whats_with_all_the_im_not_voting_if_posts/,OurPresident,1

To put my point simply, Bernie's healthcare plan requires funfunding from billionaires, but if the wealth tax truly ends up eliminating billionaires as Bernie says it will, it creates a slippery slope where you tax your source of funding out of existence.

The future is uncertain. People are more  comfortable with building on the positive accomplishments  of the past than they are with starting a revolution. That's why Biden talks about being an ""Obama-Biden Democrat"" in his speeches now. It's an attempt to link his campaign to the past. 

That's what we gotta do with our story about Bernie. There's plenty of raw material to work with. Bernie is an FDR Democrat. Bernie is a Martin Luther King Democrat. Bernie is a Cesar Chavez Democrat. He represents a tradition of activism to improve the lives of ordinary people that is nothing if not a deep and meaningful part of America's past.

fdpfw6,jackandjill22,I didn't vote for Hillary. I'm not going to vote for Biden.,"- This is a fact that I've been ashamed of for some years. Similiar to a Tusli Gabbard ""present"" vote at Trump's impeachment but considering the circumstances I think it's time to share this.

I registered just to vote for Sanders, &amp; after watching everything unfold I'm beginning to realise my disgust towards voting wasn't a a ""one off thing"" it's a reoccurring issue.

It seems the DNC has opted for the exact catastrophe as 2016.[The strategy they're employing is the same losing centrist swing-votes strategy as 2016 without discernable difference](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/clinton-election-polls-white-workers-firewall/). The Plutocratic establishment calls shots so by extension of the DNC's ties to cause it to be inflexible &amp; rigid. It seems this is symptomatic; a feature, not a bug. The disconnect between the parties interests have been laid bare as they continuously shoot themselves in the foot attempting to shield their interests from the rising populism growing from discontent in the United States reflecting by serious global issues. Rendering it inert to actually solve  these problems. __BREXIT__ is a fantastic example of centralized governmental bodies having no release-valves to address a disgruntled population &amp; it seems our ""Left party's"" pandering to American Oligarchs makes them unable to see the holistic picture &amp; unwilling to use novel tools like populism that would make a more effective strategy.

Democrats have a fundamental problem. Their base is balkanized &amp; fractured &amp; I think this is becoming an irreconcilable difference.Trump's consolidating power &amp; his constituents are laughing in hilarity as the Democratic parties having an identity crisis &amp; failing to get it's shit together.

I find myself more disappointed in moderates who're scared of their shadows, &amp; their comfort. Rather than taking a courageous stance &amp; leaning forward into a better future for us all. &amp; Then call us *""heretical""* for our dissolutionment with the direction of the party &amp; calling for unity when required for their votes when we honestly have almost *zero* in common. They have been uncompromising in their values in a way, that almost makes me admire /r/The_Donalds blue-collar base that blew up the establishment in 2016 without asking anyone's permission.

- I'm not advising anyone of anything. Not attempting to persuade or convince. It's closer to /r/Offmychest giving everyone an opportunity to search their own soul/consciences.

But obviously I wouldn't be here if I wasn't in support; this is mainly a call out/story for teens like me!

Talk with your parents about voting, if your state still has to vote, also if you can and know your parents will listen and consider what you have to say. 

Quick story time: My mom is deeply Republican and I consider myself an independent, but I've convinced her to vote next Tuesday! I asked to talk with her and we sat down and discussed politics, I asked her to vote for Bernie in the Democratic Primaries and she was like, why?? I explained to her that I can't vote and I know she'll be voting for Trump in the general main election. However I assured her that's fine, I guess, her choice but if she could vote for the primaries if she wasn't going to cast a vote then she should!

We discussed it a bit more and she eventually said she'll think about it, which we both know means a yes. But basically, don't be afraid to talk with your parents and explain to them why you like this certain candidate, hey, it may even change their mind. Just make sure to have refreshers of how he'll pay for his policies/what they are, be knowledge and try and get them out there to vote. Also, if they're hesitant due to them saying, well I'm voting for Trump in the general, then assure them that they still can! They have that choice, they are just helping push the candidate you want. Hopefully this helps a bit

Hope this is allowed but just my experience and thought if there are teens that previously thought like me, that we just had to sit around and hope for the best, we CAN make a difference. It just starts slowly, and I promise you it'll be worth having that conversation regardless. It'll be beneficial and help you cast your own vote. I just can't wait to vote in 2022! 

I hope this helped at least one person like me to talk and get another vote for Sanders, thanks for reading and if this isn't allowed I'll take it down! :))",3,1583374340,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdo42o/for_younger_supporters_encourage_parents_to_vote/,OurPresident,1

fdnv0g,SamuraiJakkass86,The DNC conspired against Bernie in 2016 because they thought they could get Hillary elected. They allowed a billionaire to buy his way into an election this time around so they could hurt his chances again. They are succeeding. GET OUT AND VOTE OR WE'RE LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY DOOMED.,"The youth voter turnout was embarrassing, beyond ridiculously low. **This is a momentum driven movement** - if you did not vote, then you are the reason it feels like we stopped moving at all.  The excuse of ""they just became adults they don't know what they're doing!"" is ridiculous.  We aren't our parents and grandparents generations - nothing has been handed to us aside from debt and toiling.  We've been political since before we graduated high school, and its only been getting more intense as the years go on.

There is literally no excuse.  If Bernie doesn't get the nomination, the reality is that we're going to end up stuck with either trump again (end of the world, civil war situation), or biden (slow acting terminal cancer, will result in more support for republicans in 2024).  I know it sounds sensationalist and *radical* (in the bad way), but we cannot afford to be complacent right now.  

For every Bernie meme you see hit the front page, remember that there are 1000 lukewarm aged corpses in walmart scooters making their ways to the voting booth so they can vote for a bigoted pedophile or that other guy they just recognize from the story-box.

fdnlro,dragonkingeight,The case for unity,"First, let me say that I’ll be posting this in both the Sanders and Warren subreddits as well as a few other places, and I do expect a fair amount of pushback from all sides. It’s one of the reasons I haven’t talked politics online much since 2016. The whole thing is stressful as fuck. Considering the circumstances we find ourselves in, I thought I’d share my two cents. Let me make it clear though, I’m not here to try to shame Warren into dropping out, nor am I here to encourage Bernie supporters to do that. If Warren decides to stay in the race, then that is her choice and it must be respected. If her supporters decide to continue to have her back. Then good, more power to them. If Bernie were in this position, I’m sure that most his supporters would be doing the same. The argument that I’m about to make isn’t about shame or principles, it’s about pure strategy and the big picture.

I’ve followed both Warren and Sanders for years, and you know what I’ve noticed? They’re actually a pretty amazing team when they’re working together. It’s true that there has been a fair amount of animosity between the campaigns lately. Honestly, considering the nature of presidential campaigns, I’m surprised it didn’t happen sooner. Now you can argue about who is in the right and who attacked who first. It could be that one party is in the right and the other was completely in the wrong. Or it could be that the democratic establishment has been playing each side against the other. Whatever the case, and whatever resentments that each side has against the other, justified or otherwise, the fact remains that the importance of these issues is miniscule compared to the big picture. That being that we have a very real shot of placing the US presidency and control of the democratic party firmly in the grip of the progressive movement, of which both Sanders and Warren are the two leading figures. When this race first started, I was excited by the prospect of seeing Warren and Sanders debate policy and bringing more Americans into the progressive fold, while seeing the corporate wing of the party eat itself. Now it appears that they’ve turned the tables. By having all the other centrist candidates drop out at literally the last minute they managed to give Biden a huge and unexpected boost right before super Tuesday. They’re united. And we’re divided. This is exactly what they have wanted the whole time and it puts us at a severe disadvantage. But there is one thing that they clearly don’t want. For us to pull off what they just did.

What I am proposing is a unified campaign. Not a mere dropout and endorsement. Sanders and Warren must come to an agreement and pool their resources. If we do that, we win, no question about it. Now,  realistically, that would mean having Sanders at the head of the ticket with Warren as VP. It is clear from the first eighteen races that Sanders has the clearer path to the nomination. That isn’t slam against Warren, it’s just the math. She deserves to be higher than where she is right now, but that’s the unfortunate reality. Again, if the tables were turned and it was Warren in the lead, I would be making the case for having her at the head of the ticket, as would many Warren supporters.

Doing this could also raise the odds of there being a Warren presidency down the line. It isn’t likely that Sanders will run for reelection in 2024, and it would only be natural for him to pass the torch to Warren. It would pretty much guarantee her candidacy and prevent the corporate wing of the party from running their own candidate. And that is the whole point. Getting the big money out of politics so that we can focus on important issues like healthcare, climate change, and economic reform unimpeded. Wall Street’s worst nightmare would be for Sanders and Warren to announce a unified campaign before next Tuesday. And need I remind everyone, that we have climate change breathing down our necks. We have less than a decade to act before the affects become irreversible. We need a progressive US government now. Not four years from now. RIGHT NOW! That’s the big picture. That’s the case for unity. The question is, what are you going to do about it?",7,1583372037,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdnlro/the_case_for_unity/,OurPresident,1

* If they can't get 100% of what they want, they'd rather watch the whole system burn, even though this means further harming actually vulnerable people.

fdku8i,Chichachachi,Last night I was angry and sad; today I donated.,"I donated to Bernie's campaign today.

Today feels like a good one to give him more energy and reevaluate what our goals are. Sometimes the best thing you can do is to pick up the goalpost and move it. The perspective is different. The grass glistens from a new angle. The vision of Bernie sweeping past the rest, becoming the one who would face Trump--that vision has lost some of its saturation. But when we look at the situation with the goalpost moved, there's a lot to celebrate. For example, his messages have penetrated much deeper than before. He has inspired many and given us hope. A movement can never be just about one individual. Not me, us.

There has been a massive increase in interest in leftist ideas in this country because of his movement. We see now how Trump is also a ""socialist,"" only for the rich. When anyone suggests to help the poor, that is demonized as the match that will set the country on fire. Who says this? The rich and those indoctrinated by them, these who do not want to pay a cent back to the society that enabled them the stability to amass their riches in the first place. They hide their riches in offshore accounts, behind money managers, by writing disproportional tax laws, and they want more.

We have seen the nervousness of the establishment and that nervousness reveals their true nature. It's been laid bare. The phenomenon of their distortion has gotten clearer to millions of people. The rich create the poor. More people are examining the logic of the free market, a market that has allowed for mega-powerful corporations and people to exert undemocratic pressure on the structures of government. When a billionaire can exert an undue amount of pressure on our institutions, that is power enough. Our tax codes should make it harder to become a billionaire, not easier. We have just seen how easily a racist, sexist, republican billionaire can bleed money into the media systems and disrupt an election by pretending to be a democrat.

There is so much good that has happened with this campaign. It is changing the ideology of the nation and gives us hope for the future.

We have clarified our understanding

We have found strong voices in ourselves and voices to listen to

We have found each other - Bernie is our ""coming out party""

I'm proud of all my communities throughout this. You have been spreading such amazing stories. You have come to this with energy. Every time Bernie takes the stage he spreads his messages deeper, and we take his messages even further by debating in the trenches. Bernie will be face to face with Biden soon. It may be one-on-one if Warren drops. In this time, America is focused on the arguments. We can continue to argue for Bernie. We can continue to argue against the myth that we can't have the services the rest of the world takes for granted; a healthy population would make the country more profitable. But we already have an extremely efficient society, a thousand times more productive than a hundred years ago. But most of that has gone up, to those at the top, and the notion that it might trickle down is a joke. The disparity between those with money and without becomes greater year by year. These things bear repeating. We can support these ideas and support people who share these ideas and see through the manipulations of the powerful. We can take care of all of us. It's possible.

Let's not be sad that our favorite candidate took what essentially is a tie. The longer the democrats fight it out and develop their arguments against one another, the longer Trump sits quietly on the sidelines. He thinks we tear each other apart and he can pick off the weakened winner. But the conversation that comes out of the spectacle of politics is education.

Not many like to agree, but this has solidified the fact that it is a class war and not a war between parties. What change do these people think Biden will bring? ZERO! Exactly, zero. They want nothing to change. They are well-off enough that they are not concerned about health insurance because their employment takes care of it. Sure, not everyone spends $20.000 per year on health care because they are relatively healthier. I don’t think they’d even blink if Biden loses to Trump because it will have little to no effect on their lives. Senior elderly black folks, how could they vote for someone who voted FOR segregation? The stench of selfishness and pride is strong. Voted for Biden because Obama told you to?

Let’s be real here... Some people would rather keep their money and let their offsprings suffocate on this burning planet. You voted for Pete because he’s gay? Sanders has been fighting for gay rights for decades! You voted for Warren because of her gender? Sanders has been fighting for equal rights for decades!

Let's not sugar coat it, last night was rough. The worst case scenario happened and Biden over-performed. 

**HOWEVER, there's still a good mathematical chance that Bernie wins a majority of the pledged delegates.** 

How, you ask? I presented the current state of the race in a table above based on the current allocation of delegates. I also highlighted some key numbers to pay attention to. Here are some observations that might cheer some of you up.

1.  Biden currently holds a 65 delegate lead. However, 284 delegates from last night have yet to be allocated. Of these 284, 189 are from CA+CO+UT. Based on current results, it's quite possible that Bloomberg and Warren end up non-viable in CA because they are both under 15% currently, with no indication it will get better for them as the votes are counted. 

2. That means, of the 3979 total pledged delegates, 2764 of them have yet to be allocated. So, of the allocated delegates, Biden is leading Bernie by 46.58%-41.23% in currently allocated pledged delegates. In terms of all delegates, Biden is currently leading Bernie 14.22%-12.59% of pledged delegates. That margin doesn't seem like much, does it? Because it's not.

3. What does this mean? This means there's A LOT of race left. The race has effectively narrowed to a 2-person race between Biden and Bernie. Bloomberg dropped out, and Warren is ""reassessing her campaign"" (which is what Bloomberg said before dropping out). If Warren does drop out soon, there's a very clear path towards nominating Bernie with a majority of pledged delegates on the first ballot. If she stays indefinitely, it's certainly harder but not impossible. 

4. Of the remaining 2764 delegates left to be allocated for the Democratic primary (including 284 yet to be allocated from last night), Bernie has to simply win 53.91% of them. That's not too bad, right? Granted, Biden only needs 51.56% but it's not that implausible. 

5. The worst part is behind us. With it being a two-person race, Bernie can allocate 100% of his energy in going after Biden. Before SC and Super Tuesday, Bernie's attention had been primarily on Bloomberg because he was perceived to be the biggest threat. Since Bloomberg flopped massively and dropped out, it's clear what the objective is. 

6. Most of the south has voted. Biden's biggest strength (his ""firewall"") was the South. Yes, there are still some southern states to vote but the remainder of the map is a lot closer than people realize. If you look at exit polling, Bernie was very competitive among white voters and winning among Latino voters massively. There are plenty of those states left. There are also quite a few ""liberal"" states left to help out with this. 

7. Fivethirtyeight is currently updating its model on the democratic primary, but let's quickly talk about what their model looked like before last night.

There are very few, almost no democracies left in the world.

Democracy is dead, the corruption rates are too high.

People with power will do everything they can to rig the system against him, especially since Bernie's political changes will make long lasting good effects, but the short term instant effects are very easy to manipulate and portray as bad.  
Simply because they benefit the people and not the %1.

It's like a fat person going for their first jog, it will feel like shit and staying at home eating pizza seems way better, but eventually jogging will feel amazing and give you more energy everyday.  

The system is way too rigged, voting machines are not allowed to be fully audited and people literally do not have access to vote.  
Some states have 2x or 3x voting rates per person, which is the complete opposite of democracy.

If he wins, he will be assassinated.  
Mark my words.  
Bernie will get brutally murdered by some corrupt politician or billionaire.

fdjn2t,wernette,Make plans with the older people in your life now,"The next debate will be held on March 15th 2020 hosted by [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN), [Univision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univision), and the [Congressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Hispanic_Caucus). 

While this debate is after the March 10th contests, this debate will be important for one reason. 

**It is very likely that it will just be Bernie and Biden**

We know that Warren is ""assessing"" her campaign today, maybe she will drop out before the 10th, but if she performs poorly on the 10th it is very likely she will drop her campaign before the debate. 

As we have seen so far, the truth is that youth turnout hasn't been great. While it would be nice to bet on that changing, it's a risk. We are much better off turning the older voters onto Bernie's side. 

We know that Bernie always performs well at debates, but Biden tends to waver and has many losing moments that are at best leveled out by his winning ones. But in a 1v1 scenario, Bernie will really shine. He won't have to deal with multiple attack angles, he knows what he needs to defend and how to go on the offense. Biden's record has so many holes in it, it is nearly impossible for Biden to make himself look better on stage if it's just him and Bernie. 

**This is the chance to show the older voters that Bernie is a leader, and worth voting for!**

Please take time to schedule a dinner with your parents or grandparents, it's a nice gesture and a way to segue into asking them to watch the debate with you. Many people agree with Bernie's ideas but don't know it because they haven't actually seen them come out of his mouth, just a distorted version from the MSM. 

We can't bet our chances on the younger ones now, we need to convert the boomers. It's not impossible. So please try.",2,1583355533,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdjn2t/make_plans_with_the_older_people_in_your_life_now/,OurPresident,1

This morning I woke up with regrets for not going to his rally in Boston on Saturday. I have regrests for not canvassing around town because I hated my old door to door Fios sales job. I regret not making cold calls around the country because I hate doing that in my current job as a recruiter.

Hell I regret not even bothering to confirm that my roommates (house of 10 people all under 30) were going out to vote.

I got complacent. I thought we had this. I thought there were millions of people as riled up as I was, so I didn't donate any of my limited free time.

I think this is the story of what happened yesterday. I think we all got complacent in our bubbles and forgot that Revolutions are generally unpopular, and they require vigilance.

We lost a battle yesterday, but not the war. Take some time to process what happened. Then turn that anger into action.

If you're reading this, what did you do to help Bernie yesterday? How many doors did you knock on? How many calls did you make? How much money did you donate? Can you walk into your bathroom right now, look in that mirror and tell yourself ""I did everything I could"". Are you going to be able to sleep peacefully tonight?

fdh3v9,belleandherbeast,"I grew up in Mississippi and, after last night, I'm feeling pretty devastated.","I'm trying really hard not to be disheartened by yesterday's results. Bernie is still really close to Biden's delegates. This election is really important to me; even more important than 2016 was.

Last night was really hard to witness. This is coming from someone who never cared about politics. I grew up in Mississippi and everyone I knew were Republicans. I never found myself tied to either party and had the attitude of ""we get who we get"". 

In 2016, Bernie Sanders started to become more known in the public eye. The first time I heard him speak, I cried. It was surprising to me, someone who had generally been apathetic about the state of our country, to find myself getting so involved. I attended every rally of his that I could. I watched every Democratic debate. I felt empowered, motivated, and hopeful for the future. 

I love my family and it hurts to be attacked purely based off of the idea that I'm a ""liberal"", ""Democrat"", ""millennial"", and whatever other regurgitated slander they've picked up from the media. 

I don't support Bernie because I'm liberal. I don't support Bernie because I'm a Democrat. I support Bernie because of this; I grew up in Mississippi. I grew up not knowing what a PCP was. If you got sick, then you just let it run its course. When it didn't get better, you went to a quick care clinic and got antibiotics. Going to the doctor wasn't for preventative care; it was a last-ditch effort in the event of a worst case scenario. 

In recent years, I've seen my aunt forego her anti-nausea pills after chemotherapy because they were too expensive. I've had to watch my uncle, who had just been airlifted to the hospital, walk out of the ER because he was worried about the hospital bill. I've watched my mother go without her blood pressure medication for weeks because she can't afford it. I've seen her sacrifice things so she could pay for my autistic nephew's medication. 

I live in Boston and have so for the past six years. I have access to pretty decent, affordable healthcare. I've already gotten my education so free college doesn't benefit me. I live somewhere that, even though the minimum wage isn't technically $15 an hour, most minimum wage jobs offer $15 an hour. 

I don't support Bernie for the ""free"" stuff he can give me. I support Bernie because I don't want to see my loved ones die at an early age to something that was entirely preventable. Mississippi has the lowest life expectancy rate! Everyone deserves to have the option to go to the doctor, to attend college, to make a living minimum wage.",3,1583345628,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdh3v9/i_grew_up_in_mississippi_and_after_last_night_im/,OurPresident,1

fdh352,PurposelyLost,Super Tuesday does not reflect Bernie's Electability,"Joe won:  
Alabama (red), Tennessee (red), Arkansas (red), Oklahoma (red), Texas (red), North Carolina (toss up), Virginia (blue), Minnesota (blue), Massachusetts (blue), Maine (blue)  
Of the 10 states Joe won on Super Tuesday, 5 of them almost always go Red in the presidential race. Support in these areas, although nice to have, theoretically does not mean anything in the big picture.   
2 of 5 “blue/tossup” states, he won simply because Bernie and Warren split the progressive vote (Massachusetts and Maine).  
Henceforth, Joe performed well (without obvious outside influence) in 3 states: Virginia (13), Minnesota (10), and North Carolina (15). 38 Total Delegates in the Presidential Election.

Bernie Won:  
Utah (red), Vermont (blue), Colorado (blue), California (blue)  
1 of these 4 goes Red in the presidential elections.  
This means that Bernie performed well in 3 states: Vermont (3), Colorado (9), and California (55). 62 Total delegates in the Presidential Election. 

My point here is that Joe “won” Super Tuesday by having the progressive vote split and receiving support from States that aren’t even “blue” states. His victory does have an impact on the outcome of the nomination, however, DO NOT BELIEVE that this reflects on Bernie’s electability.

&amp;#x200B;

The energy behind this movement has been incredibly encouraging to me.  Through these last several years in this timeline, I have been battered by the climate.  My faith in the American experiment has collapsed.  It is this movement that keeps me having some type of hope.  You are the Latina shouting for justice reform, the African American woman building her coalition for electoral reform, the hard working middle-class kid who has broken out of his his privilege bubble.

&amp;#x200B;

When I am at the marches and the protests, you are the ones that have the energy - the rest of us are just grumpy and tired.

&amp;#x200B;

Just remember the rest of us.  We are the later-day hippies, the exhausted first wave feminists, the aged anarchists, the retired Black Panther, the parents of the LGBTQ+ kids and we love going to Pride.     
 Remember the factory hand who is out-of-work but has to walk the cultural line just to get a job.  Remember the Latino Rancher who just wants to do his work and have a decent life.  We all just want everything to be OK.  We have pride in our America, and we have worked to keep it worthy of our pride, but we mostly now just want things to be OK.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe y'all don't need to hear from this middle-age, middle-class, center-left white male.  But I need to say it anyhow.  Please keep going.  It is helping, I know it is.  We are listening, it is working.

This election is far from over. Joe can be defeated. The nomination is still up for grabs, and there are many states ahead that are winnable for Bernie.

But if it comes down to it - and I sure as hell hope it doesn't - I'm going to be willing to compromise. 

Because democracy isn't perfect.

I'm a millenial. I have massive student loan debts. I think weed should be legal. I'm deeply in love with Sanders platform and stance on social justice issues. I want Wall Street to be held accountable. I want the Green New Deal. And I want my country to feel sane again.

But more than anything, I want Donald Trump defeated. We're talking about a tyrant who doesn't want anything I've listed above and is basically doing anything he can to regress the United States. Human rights don't mean shit to Donald Trump. Neither does the rule of law.

Because I don't want Trump winning - I'll do what's right this time around and compromise. 

We can hate on the Pete's, Amy's Mike's, and Beto's supporting Biden. And the DNC for siding so clearly with Joe. 

But what's more challenging to do is empathize with it. Yeah - Joe is about as far from perfect as it gets from my platform. But he's also not a bad person. 

And although my values are more progressive than his, Joe still represents a return to the status quo of Obama's America. And no, that America wasn't perfect. 

But Obama's America respected the rule of law and democratic institutions. And that's the battle we're currently fighting against Donald Trump.

fdgcqs,dengop,Let's think of better strategy to mobilize young voters,"Please don't use policy issues to attract young voters to go out and vote. The success rate is incredibly low as this Super Tuesday results have shown. Behavior modification is incredibly hard,  and time and time, it has shown facts do not change or drive people's behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

Students fully know they should do homework, but they don't.

We all know we should exercise consistently for better health but most people don't.

There are other myriads of examples like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

So no matter how much you dangle ""M4A,"" ""tuition free college,"" people aren't going to come out to vote for it. The rewards are too abstract and far away compared to the immediate inconvenience of going to vote. Don't discount the psychological inertia. People who have never voted will have to overcome the inertia to go out and vote. That's hard.

&amp;#x200B;

So the strategy has to shift so that young people are more rewarded for voting. Now this is the hard part. What would tick the young voters to go out and vote? We need to brainstorm, and I'll throw some of my ideas in.

&amp;#x200B;

1) First we need to make voting cool. As a society, we need to start a culture where people are proud for voting and encouraging other to vote. Do we live in such a society? No. Everyone is somewhat apathetic about it. If a person votes and posts it on instagram and that person should get tons of likes.  If a person sees on TikTok that 3 of their friends went to vote, maybe that might encourage them to go out and vote. Maybe there has to be one of those trash pick up movement that started 1-2 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Find out who these young voters listen to? Is it a twitch streamer? Youtube/tiktok celebrity? Find the people and channel that have great influence on these young voters. The important thing is not that these people endorse Sanders or not. The important thing is these people should encourage voting to their listeners and viewers. It doesn't matter if these influencers think a certain candidate is good, if they don't encourage any action on it. Their viewers and listeners will think the candidate is good, but they wont' go out to vote. So instead, keep prodding them to go out and vote. I think Sanders' interview with Joe Rogan was a smart idea, but such interview alone won't drive young voters to go out and vote. Joe Rogan probably has to keep instilling the idea of why voting is important regardless of the candidates . So this is the tricky part. How do we encourage these influencers to keep encouraging people to vote? For hollywood celebrities, maybe, Sanders could ask them to keep encouraging to go out and vote rather than a simple endorsement.  Endorsement means nothing if people don't go out and vote.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to realize that facts and policies won't drive people, especially young voters, to go out and vote. We need to find other channels and methods to motivate them to go out and vote. I know my post is half-baked at best as I'm writing quickly before I go to work, but I hope this could be a good starting point where we can discuss some strategies.",2,1583342711,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdgcqs/lets_think_of_better_strategy_to_mobilize_young/,OurPresident,1

fdg8pc,Sherlock-ACD,DON'T GIVE UP! This is FAR from over!,"Let's talk about where we are today:

1. The media narrative is both heavily unfavorable to Bernie and also a bit premature. We all knew it would be used as a weapon against a political revolution, so no surprise there.
2. Young people need to vote and we need to do what we can to educate them on the voting process even more than the issues. The knowledge and ability to vote is just as important as an understanding of the issues and the candidates.
3. The delegates have yet to be completely allocated and tallied. There are also votes still being counted and processed and these initial numbers will change. 
4. The states that Biden did the best in are the states with the highest amount of voter suppression. The democratic establishment has made a fuss about this for years, but Biden is their guy so you won't hear a peep.
5. Bernie did the best in states that WILL GO BLUE in the general election. Biden keeps winning states that have gone Republican since the 1980's. Is Trump really going to lose Alabama or South Carolina to Joe Biden? Really? Many battle ground states like Colorado and Nevada went to Bernie - the rest of these states can be very similar if we keep the momentum.

My last point:

If we get to the convention and there is still no delegate majority, we need to have a serious discussion about an organized 3rd party for the 2022 midterms and 2024 election. 

Not a protest candidate for 2020 --- NO! 

But... millions of actual voters (not possible voters) are losing their say in our democratic process and there needs to be political consequences for both the Republican and Democratic party.

We need to have a serious discussion about a viable, organized party where the working class are able to channel their ideas and needs into action. A party that accepts all races, religions, generations and genders into candidates who are removed from big donors and political gamesmanship.

I'm going to keep fighting and I hope you will too.",5,1583342266,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdg8pc/dont_give_up_this_is_far_from_over/,OurPresident,1

Judging from reading posts in other subreddits, we apparently have a reputation of “Bernie or nothing.” I would argue that we need to collectively try to fight against that reputation, by being vocal that we would support whoever wins the democratic nomination in order to stop Trump.

1. We have a moral responsibility to stop Trump.
2. We have a social responsibility to support our party and the democratic process.
3. If we show the Democrats that we are willing to help the party now, it will facilitate good will in the long term. If we don’t support Biden (assuming Sanders doesn’t win the nomination), it hurts further democratic socialist causes because nobody will support us in kind.

“But u/TheStressDoctor, I’m tired of having to be the bigger person. We never get supported. I want change now!” 

I totally get it. I want change now too. We need change. But the reality isn’t always what you want it to be, and democratic socialism will always be an uphill battle in the U.S. because of our culture.

2. Elizabeth Warren needs to drop out and endorse Bernie. Biden is getting all the endorsements and Warren took a lot of votes from Bernie on Super Tuesday.

fdfevu,RAshomon999,"Not Attacking Biden Hurt Sanders Super Tuesday Results, Biden is Particularly Weak to Attack","TLDWTR; Pivoting to Bloomberg and not killing Biden's campaign with attacks allowed the establishment Democrats to regroup around Biden and support his comeback. Biden is a lot weaker than the media presents. He is vulnerable in key states and demographic groups, such as retirees and African Americans, which he is relying on. He will be attacked in the general election on his strengths with those groups. Bernie can make those states and groups competitive now if he goes on the offensive.

Many posts have focused on young people not showing up to vote, but few have focused on the shift in attention from Biden's dying but not finished campaign to Bloomberg by the Sanders campaign. They were not the only ones; all candidates directed most attacks at Bloomberg. Giving Biden breathing room for the establishment to solidify around him allowed his comeback on Tuesday.

Since South Carolina, the focus has been on Bloomberg and the Sanders campaign has let up on Biden (not pointing out his gaffes, letting up on past Social Security actions), not attacking the former VP and allowing their campaign breathing room to resurge.

Sanders has not done many negative ads but the Social Security ads against Biden were effective. This is an indication of where the election will be if Biden is nominated. 

Since Karl Rove began in the 1980s, the go to strategy for the Republicans is to discredit any strength that their opponent can claim and turn it into a liability; ie. Swiftboating Kerry, attacking the economy/healthcare, expertise for Gore (yes, ads on how Bush would fight for better health care and lowering gas costs compared to Gore, who was a part of an administration that saw a huge expansion of the economy and fought for health care reform and reducing government waste were sent out), and twisting government experience/ competence for Hillary ala crooked Hillary.

Biden's strengths are his connection to Obama, trustworthiness/friendliness/sense that he is the safe choice, and he isn't Hillary. Each of those will be subverted in the general election and it's better to pull that Band-Aid off now. For Obama, they will use Biden's previous remarks on segregation, race, social security and the safety net against him. If the republicans are going to spend millions on ads about how Clinton criminal justice policies harmed black communities to persuade a few % points from not showing up, the will pay for a lot of airtime for the unsavory quotes that Biden has had through the years. You saw a taste of what can happen when they ran ads talking about Biden's record on Social Security were aired and those will be considered mild in comparison. Biden will provide plenty of material against trusted/friendly/safe because of his gaffes, even last night he mistook his wife for his sister. ""Not Hillary"" subversion has already been starting to ramp up with the Hunter Biden attacks, they will paint him as just as ""corrupt as Hillary.""

Bernie does not need to go as negative and it seems against the campaign's nature to do so but they need to go a little negative especially in Biden's safe states and groups.

Different states have different opportunities for Bernie and liabilities for Biden. Hitting hard on Safety and Social Security in high retiree states like Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania will shift their dynamics (Right now, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi see to be viewed as Biden's to lose and one of Biden's key demographics is older Americans). In rust belt states like Illinois, Biden is weak on Social Security and trade deals that have harmed the area. Primaries like Mississippi, Georgia, DC, Louisiana, where the African American vote is a high percentage, Bernie can't go as negative as the general election but if he pushes more of his civil rights activism verse Biden's absence and pick up a few good endorsements, those votes are more competitive and Biden has to use resources to keep them.

fdet4o,ViviCetus,Vote Bernie no matter who. Organize.,"Even if the establishment is against us, their media machine is more expansive, and their money is insurmountable, it doesn't change the facts. We're still right. The platform is still right, because human rights are still human rights, the planet is still dying, and the solution is still the Green New Deal.

Bloomberg, Biden, and Warren are functionally Republicans; fine. The leadership of the DNC are transparently trading our collective future for a shot at sinecures; we already knew that. Super Tuesday wasn't the stake through the heart we were hoping for. But we can still behead the beast. Come November 3, Election Day 2020, the Democratic establishment will unite behind Bernie, or fall as we split the vote.

We must use the strength of our movement: our ability to organize outside of the polls, which are closed down or otherwise denied to us in the first place. Progressives, socialists, anarchists, communists, and Bernie voters of all stripes must put aside our differences and create physical communities together, in order to support one another and the movement in this decisive time. We are no use to anyone when we are separated, and our collective power is wasted alone. If we can collectivize, we can meet our needs together, and prove our point despite the power and wealth aligned against us. At this point, we must come together to defend ourselves, and by necessity to exercise all the rights we still possess in this life-or-death election.

Literally quit your job and uproot the life that dwindles before your eyes. This movement is what's important right now. Whoever wins the nomination, we cannot bow to the will of the Corporate Democratic-Republican machine, but must unite as Populists, in person.

I suggest that, in order to meet our needs as a movement and those of any strikes we may choose to support, we should create a new sub and other presences to plan, spread the word, vote, and arrange transportation to those sites we choose, which should be numerous and spread around the whole country, as Sanders supporters are, at places most in need of services. We should provide benefits the same as a unionized national firm for all members via this organization, within the community if possible. It would be appropriate to start an organization of worker cooperatives in order to each meet a particular need of those communities, while remaining flexible as a group, and allowing members to work as they are able and as they choose. If we can accomplish basic functionality as a group, we will have already beaten the system at its own game.",4,1583336631,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdet4o/vote_bernie_no_matter_who_organize/,OurPresident,1

fdeimy,tiredofmarchingband,Convince me,"Hey, y’all. 

I recently turned 18 and I’ll be voting in my first presidential election very soon. 

After a long while of being a die-hard President Trump supporter, I’m possibly looking to jump ship with a democratic nominee. 

I’m looking for a genuine discussion/chat as to why Bernie is the better choice! 

Please don’t use any of the typical “orange man bad” reasoning...

I don’t know if it has any standing, but here are some of my beliefs:

1.) I do share a few beliefs with Bernie around taxes

2.) Not that I hate trans individuals, but I will probably
not advocate for pro-trans topics. It’s just the way I see things and I personally don’t see a change to that anytime soon.

3.) I don’t really like individuals like AOC just based off of her behavior. I haven’t looked into her ideals

The entire reason I’m possibly changing my vote is because I had asked my mother what Obama did wrong and I couldn’t get a straight answer out of her...not that really has anything to do with it

Please use this as a serious moment as you could persuade my friends and myself to vote differently if I truly start to believe in Bernie...if this is just downvote brigaded it’s likely I won’t really try to reach out  to any community again in an attempt to learn something...


I’m leaving this post up overnight and I’ll read when I wake up. If the post goes tits up then I’ll just remove it I guess",8,1583335414,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fdeimy/convince_me/,OurPresident,1

Maybe it's because Super Tuesday isn't a national holiday. Maybe it's because the lines in some places were long and you didn't want to wait.

Or maybe it's because you don't think your vote matters, you're apathetic to the whole political system, and just figure ""common sense"" will put the right candidate back in office and the universe will somehow magically balance itself out.

fdegp0,dbclass,This fight isn't over yet,"I've spent most of my adolescent life ignoring politics and the impacts it has on our everyday life. I was too blind to recognize that the unfair systems that are in place are a creation of our own, something that we can mold and make better. I thought things were just the way they are, so why be loud and mount a huge fight against what's inevitable. That's until I heard the message of a 70+-year-old white guy in a state far away from my southern one. We all know what he's saying is true, but he personally gave me the belief that we can fight back, and in many ways we have. Now we're at a crossroads. We knew this fight wouldn't be easy, so why should we let this discourage us. We are a few states away from beating Biden. Now it's time for us to take a final stand.  I want to fight to change the system. It's been against us our whole lives and we spent a considerable time ignoring it, but now we have to fight like this is our final chance. A puny Biden victory last night does not change what we have to do. It should just motivate us even more. We need to get out and knock on every door, talk to every voter, inform fellow African Americans about Joe's racist past, inform Latino voters about Obama's huge deportation record, and flood the airwaves with messages of progressive values and why they stand up better than Biden's. This isn't just a race for our next president. This is a race that decides whether our world lives or dies. We are going against the most powerful people on the planet so don't bow out after one battle. This isn't supposed to be easy, yet we're doing it. Bernie has won California, Utah, Colorado, Vermont, and the first three primaries. We're still in this and we're going to fight until the last vote is counted. What are we waiting for?

fd5tui,sunchipsareokay,Independent who normally leans right considering Sanders (never thought I'd ever say that) - Question,"As the title says I'm an independent who has wavered around a bit. I've voted R one time, and D twice - at least for the office of the president. Locally it's a different story and a lot more nuanced.

I was a big fan/supporter of the idea of Obamacare. Note that I said the idea, not what the final product was. While of course I like the idea of everyone getting access to healthcare as Bernie &amp; co. talk about, I feel that it's just sadly not realistic in the US. I don't think it's realistic for a handful of reasons but mostly the top to bottom fucked up corruption in this country allowing insurance companies to essentially write the laws which govern themselves. That's beyond bizarre.

That being said, I'm not liking any of my other options. At all. Admittedly I was open to giving trump a shot after he was elected. I've been disappointed by his actions in two main avenues, one being his admins pathetic response to covid19.

So what I'm trying to say in a long winded way is, I like bernie's healthcare ideas but I just don't see how they would be able to be enacted. I hope I'm just missing something here and that if someone could clear it up for me I'd feel a lot better about considering him.

fd21v0,Bragisson,I made a site sourced write up of Bernie’s appraisal of Cuban social programs.,"Cuba enacted universal healthcare, education reform, and a powerful social security program. 

The [literacy rate ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Literacy_Campaign) of Cuba rose from 77% to nearly 100% in a couple years. This was an incentive to build more schools, and train teachers, focused in extremely poor areas. More than 700,000 adults were taught how to read and write through the program. I don’t see why this is a bad thing.

In 1979, Cuba enacted their [Universal Healthcare Reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Cuba) , stating “Everybody has the right to Heath protection and care.” They funded programs for universal vaccination, which included free vaccines for polio, and tetanus. The Cuban government, along with their literacy campaign, pushed the training of doctors, and the building of hospitals and care centers in impoverished areas. I still don’t see why this is a bad thing!

Cuba set into effect their [Social Security Reform](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/ssptw/2016-2017/americas/cuba.html) to make sure anyone who was retiring, or disabled, would have a pension in their late life. It was more aggressive in taxation than the United States Social Security program, and had many permanent placements that could not be cut. I don’t see why this is a bad thing. 

Taking Bernie’s praises for the social programs of Cuba, and saying he was admiring an authoritarian dictatorships horrid rein is really reaching.",4,1583271695,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fd21v0/i_made_a_site_sourced_write_up_of_bernies/,OurPresident,1

fd1s7s,Rowboat315,Does Bernie have a plan for Farmers? (Regarding his plan to tax the wealthiest 1.8%),"Hey y'all,

I'm very much planning to vote for Bernie. However, an area I have trouble talking about is how his policies will specifically affect farmers. 

It is not uncommon for farms, especially family farms that have lasted a long time, to record incomes greater than $250,000. According to Bernie's [How to pay](https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/) page, that is the cutoff. The thing is most of that income goes directly back into the farm's day-to-day. Equipment and repairs are very expensive things. 

In the interest of full disclosure, my family have grown peaches and pecans for generations, they're the ""big"" operation. My brother and father operate a pecan farm with 4-5 employees. We are so very fortunate, and live comfortably. We are likely wealthier than I realize, which is uncomfortable. But we're definitely not the ultra rich 

so what scares my family is the thought that Bernie's policies will negatively affect farmers, not those who are gigantic corporate entities, but the families who have managed to hold on for so long. 

Please help me better understand how farmers could be impacted by all this. I'm certain someone here can pick up on my situation and better explain it to others.",6,1583270609,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fd1s7s/does_bernie_have_a_plan_for_farmers_regarding_his/,OurPresident,1

fcyusl,SovietWinnebago,Bernie Sanders and the path to victory,"So, here we are. Bernie has more support than ever and seems to have to momentum and staying power to win this. I’m ready to see him in the White House and to change this country for the better. I'm ready for President Sanders to change this country for the better

There’s just one problem. Everyone wants him to succeed except for politicians. As I see it, there’s 3 major hurdles that need to clear themselves or that Bernie needs to seriously address before he wins this.

1. Warren. I really don’t get her plan here. She isn’t polling nearly as strong as her contemporaries and while her violent mauling of  Bloomberg was needed and enjoyable, she’s going to hurt her party now over helping it. She has the same power as Bernie where most of her supporters are going to stick with her for better or for worse as long as she stays in the election. Now for Bernie, this is great as it may be the thing that pushes him to victory but in Warren’s case, her base is small enough to where she can't win, but large enough she’ll most likely pull away votes that would have otherwise gone to Bernie. I’m not saying that if she drops out, all the people are going to change their vote, but I’d take a few from Warren's group helping Bernie over them working against him. She either needs to drop out soon or tell her supporters to keep an open mind or it might irreversibly work against Bernie and cost him and, by extension, her party this election.
2. The curious case of Bloomberg. This one baffles me. He dumps nearly half a billion dollars into his campaign to be destroyed by every other democratic candidate, to then dump nearly half a billion more to... what? Win? Anyone could see that he won't even get close. The three most interesting theories I've heard are that either he is using this campaign as a tax scheme and will ultimately walk away in a better financial situation having done this, that he is a sore ass loser and wants to pollute the pool the best he can so that since he can't win, no one can, or that he legitimately believes he can buy the presidency with enough money put behind him. I've also seen people say that he's a Trump shill and this is a huge ploy to hurt the democrats and put Trump back in office so Bloomberg can take advantage of the things Trump is doing to help the uber-rich like Bloomberg. That one seems a little too smart for him and slightly far fetched. Maybe not. Who am I to know? Regardless, Bloomberg is in the same position as Warren in that he serves only to hurt Bernie the longer he stays in. At this point, I'm surprised he still is and I would be astonished if there was no ulterior motive.
3. The Democratic Establishment. What the hell? Like they get hard just thinking of Bernie not winning. He polls fantastically and wins state after state, he has the support of millions across the country, and is coherent and concise and knows what he's talking about and they fucking ignore him. They pull a ""ThIs Is StIlL aNyOnE's RaCe"" and pretend that Bernie isn't the clear frontrunner. Then they see Biden do well in one state, and all of a sudden ""BIDEN BIDEN BIDEN"". Almost every high level democrat comes out in support of Biden. Just about every serious democratic presidential candidate that drops out endorses Biden. Biden was considered to be another low polling ticket pick not unlike Klobuchar or Steyer. Just another inoffensive and weak polling moderate. But South Carolina comes and the democrats all see Biden do slightly well and then he jumps to the most important candidate ever that they promote as the candidate that will lead the Democratic Party to the White House. They were so desperate to find someone other than Bernie to support, they pick the next person to do marginally better in 1 state over Bernie. I'm personally lukewarm on Biden but would pick Bernie over him in a second and regardless of politics, it's scummy to do what they're doing to Bernie, even on a moral level. They showed their hand and it was to get Bernie out as fast as they could and jump on the back of the first person that wasn't him. At this point, I maybe would have prefered that they stay silent and wait until after Super Tuesday at least, but they clearly are trying to force someone else over Bernie and possibly (probably) hurt his chances.

I want Bernie to win. I live in California and have already put in my vote for Bernie. I truly believe his plan for America is a good one and is sorely needed. If you're able to vote in this election, please do. Now more than ever we need to show this country what the American people really want. But I am getting increasingly worried as the days go on that a combination of those issues, the smaller issues (by smaller I really mean the effects aren't as disastrous yet) like Trump's support base and Russian interference, and the electoral college possibly taking away what should be a landslide victory, will not deliver the president we deserve. I'm too afraid of what will happen otherwise.

TL;DR Bernie has big obstacles to face. Warren will pull possible voters away and hurt her party, Bloomberg is a joke that stopped being funny after he didn't give up and his money could do more harm than good at this point, and the democrats are actively working to hurt Bernie's chances of winning by forcing Biden as far up the ticket as they get him when he didn't seem to have the power to do it himself.

I live in Florida...I know it’s a “red” state but I can’t believe anyone would be so rude. What do I do?

I want to go to a hardware store and make another sign but I’m worried since, when my husband realizes, he’ll want me to take it down. He supports Bernie too but he was afraid someone might try and do something to our house. 

I’m so sad and hurt right now. Any advice or even personal stories would be very welcome.

Quite a biography!  How accurate it is?  there's a lot more at Snopes....which DOES confirm some of what's here.

In all her years in congress Elizabeth Warren introduced 110 bills.  2 passed.   Cory Booker  introduced 120 bills.  0 passed.

Kamala Harris introduced 54 bills. 0 passed. 

Bernie Sanders is truly special. He never held a job until he was finally elected mayor at age 53.  He lived off of welfare and four different women one of whom had a child out-of-wedlock and the three marriages did not work out.

In all his years in the Senate, he introduced 364 bills. 3 passed. Two of those were to name post offices.

If you want to know what kind of leader Bernie is,  go to Wikipedia, it’s a long report.

The following is condensed version :

Bernie Sanders’ father was a high school drop-out, who tormented his family with rants about their financial problems.   He blamed society and economic inequality for his plight, though as a white male in a middle class neighborhood, he was hardly among the downtrodden. This was Bernie’s inspiration to take up the cause of economic justice, though he would spend half of his life as an able-bodied college graduate living off of unemployment checks, and the women in his life, between odd jobs.

By his own admission, Bernie was not a great student, starting at Brooklyn College and transferring to Univ. of Chicago, but this enrollment kept him protected from the draft.  He joined socialist organizations and dabbled in far-left communist politics, gaining national notoriety by petitioning the school to let students have sex in the dormitories.

This was before birth control and abortion were legal, when there were still very serious repercussions for women if the condom broke, but that didn’t stop him from crusading against those silly rules that were an obstacle to his own satisfaction.   He participated in the 1963 March on Washington, a few demonstrations, and was arrested once, but his activism for civil rights ended when he became obsessed with socialism.  NOT “democratic socialism”, but oppressive far-left Marxism.

Bernie married his college sweetheart, Deborah Shilling, and spent his small inheritance on a summer home in Vermont on 85 acres.  The shack had a dirt floor and no electricity, maintaining his proletariat credibility, but not impressing his new bride.   He refused to get a steady job, so his wife didn’t stick around long, divorced after 18 months.

The Viet Nam war was escalating, and when the next draft was announced, Bernie applied for a conscientious objector deferment.  His deferment was denied, so he dodged the draft by having a kid out of wedlock in 1969 with his new girlfriend, Susan Mott,  even though he STILL wasn’t working, and had no way to support the child.  By the time his draft number came up, he was too old to be drafted anyway.

He continued to subsist on odd carpentry jobs and unemployment checks, and occasionally selling $15 articles, including the one about how women fantasize about gang rape. He still refused to get a steady job to support his child.  His girlfriend left him. In 1988 he married Jane Driscoll, and took a cold-war era honeymoon in communist USSR.  His new wife supported Bernie financially through his many attempts to win a public office, and shared his radical leftist political views.  They visited the pro-Soviet Sandinista Government in Nicaragua known for their human rights violations, support for anti-American terrorists, and the imprisonment and exile of opponents.  Bernie blindly overlooked the carnage to stand with fellow socialists.

They traveled to Cuba in hopes of meeting Bernie’s hero Fidel Castro, but access to him was denied.  Bernie Sanders managed not to hold a full-time job his entire life or vote in a single election, until he finally ran for Mayor of Burlington at the age of 40.   After several failed elections, he finally won the office of Mayor of Burlington, VT, and eventually a Senate seat, which he has managed to keep off and on. For all of his years representing Vermont, Bernie Sanders passed a total of three bills, and two of them were for naming post offices. He’s a draft-dodging deadbeat dad, a globe-trotting communist dilettante, and a petulant detractor of hard-working honorable Democrats.

His one skill is yelling about how unfair the world is, and how everything SHOULD be.

But he has no plans for how to make it happen, and no idea what goes on in the rest of the world or how to deal with problems overseas.   His excuse for not having a foreign policy or national security plank on his platform: “I’ve only been campaigning for three months.”

His socialist friends are bitter about what they see as a betrayal of their values by Bernie’s pursuit of the Democratic nomination.   His former wife and girlfriend run when they see reporters and will not speak to the press.

Bernie’s past, including a brief stint living in a kibbutz in Israel is cloaked in secrecy. (It worked for B Hussein.)

Former employees and coworkers describe him as hostile and belligerent.  All of the Democrats in Vermont’s government endorsed Hillary Clinton.",6,1583238598,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fctv74/i_was_emailed_this_by_my_grandparents_im_putting/,OurPresident,1

fctp8e,WalrusNjnja,I am fairly sure Sander’s health care plan would legitimately kill me.,"Let me preface by saying that I am a young guy with brain cancer. I’ve had it for 10 years, since college. Luckily,  my employment has a very good health care system. Luckily, I fall into the upper-middle class. However, after having the conversation with my doctor, I am now aware the danger that mr. Sander’s plan could put me in. 

My doctor has told me that I would most likely lose him as a doctor in the event of Bernie’s health care plan, as I would lose my insurance and would have no way to pay extra for a good doctor. To add insult to injury, the period of instability in the medical system would prove detrimental for my health. I use a clinical trial, and Mr. Sander’s system would create a huge amount of instability in that. 

So, does anyone here have an immediately life threatening illness that could shed some light on the issue? I only had like a 4% chance of survival a couple years ago, and it is fairly higher now. However, I fear that the new system may lower that number. My aunt has a similarly permanent, lethal cancer and she is adamantly anti-Bernie, primarily because of it. 

I should also say I’m not rich, seeing as how every other time I’ve tried to make this post on a throwaway everyone in this sub screams about how it is billions of times worse to have this happen when your poor.

fcqt07,Simple-Coffee,We need to talk about Elizabeth Warren...,"Lately I've been hearing so much from my fellow Bernie supporters about the need for Warren to drop out. It's getting so much traction on social media and in progressive circles and at first glance, it seems like the smart play; it's not. Warren dropping out would be a huge blow to the Sanders campaign, here's why:

People have a vastly distorted view of Warrens voter base. Most people are using assumptions that might have been accurate 6 months ago, but are no longer close to being accurate today. The vast majority of progressives have consolidated under Sanders at this point, so much so that Warrens voter base is comprised of mostly moderate-leaning voters. I know... you don't believe me, I understand your skepticism, but it's true, I'll explain.

The first example of this came from Iowa. In precincts where Warren was nonviable, the 2nd choice of her supporters was a 3-way statistical tie between Bernie, Biden, and Buttigieg. Now you're going to say ""but OP, Iowa is super white! Surely it's not representative of the nation as a whole?"", and you'd be right. What we can take from Iowa though is that in mostly-white states, Warren voters will pick a moderate over Sanders at a 2:1 ratio.

Now, lets take a look at nationally. I've had people quoting a recent Morning Consult poll to me all evening showing that 40% of Warren supporters have Bernie as their second choice. While I'm skeptical of this poll, I'm going to take it as gospel for the sake of the argument. This means that 60% of Warren supporters would rather choose someone more moderate than someone more progressive. 60%. That means nationally, Warrens base leans moderate by a 20-point margin. That is HUGE.

So, we've established that in mostly-white states, Warren voters pick a moderate at a 2:1 ratio, and nationally they pick a moderate at a 3:2 ratio. Either way you slice it, the remainder of Warrens base is not favorable to Bernie.

Another thing to be extremely concerned about is the ""refugee"" voters from Buttigieg and Klobuchar. That vast majority of those voters will not vote for Sanders in a primary, but could still possibly vote Warren. Warren is in a unique middle-of-the-road position between moderates and progressives which means she still has the ability to siphon off some of those ""refugee"" voters that would have otherwise gone to Biden. Warren staying in tempers Biden's surge from the moderate consolidation that's happened today. If she were to drop out, Biden picks up a lot of those voters.

In conclusion, the longer Elizabeth Warren stays in the race, the better chance Bernie has at winning the nomination. I understand many of you want to wrap this up before the convention, but it's not going to happen. Bernie's best chance at the nomination is to go into the convention with the most votes and the most delegates, and play chicken with the DNC and see who blinks first. The DNC is smart, they know if Bernie is leading going in and they choose someone else, they've basically handed Trump the election. We're in for the long haul now, and we need to prove to the DNC that we're not bluffing.

Based off of all the data we have so far, I just don't see how Warren dropping out would be beneficial to Bernie, and I can see way too many reasons that it would be detrimental. I understand the logic people have used to come to the conclusion that Warren should drop out, but when you really stop and look at the numbers, look at all the factors and focus on more than just a singular poll, you start to see the big picture.

The recent movement to get Warren to drop out is extremely shortsighted, albeit well-intentioned. I understand what people are trying to accomplish, but they're hurting their own cause. So to anyone  reading this, please consider all the factors at play and when your fellow Sanders supporters beg for Warren to drop out, tell them why it's a bad idea. It's extremely hard to stop this ""drop out"" mentality now that it's already started, but we have to try. EVERYTHING is at stake.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Warren dropping out would be bad for the Sanders campaign. I understand my fellow Sanders supporters are well-meaning, but advocating for Warren to drop out is hurting our own cause. The numbers just don't justify the argument that she should drop out.

NOTE: This is the conclusion I have come to and I believe that the numbers back up my argument, however, I am willing to change my mind based on new evidence, so please, if you disagree with me, tell me why. I want the campaign to succeed and so I believe it's my responsibility to let people know why I think they're making a mistake, but I encourage you to make a strong argument if you disagree. Whatever the outcome of this thread/discussion, it will only help the Sanders campaign.",6,1583218474,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fcqt07/we_need_to_talk_about_elizabeth_warren/,OurPresident,1

fcpfy7,Secret-Lecture,Who should be Bernie's Secretary of State? I'm leaning towards Mayor Pete! Please. Quick! Sell me on someone else instead.," 

Hear me out...

1. The  majority's of Pete's supporters have Bernie as their second choice.  Pete agrees with Bernie on every single issue except for Medicare for  All, which is a purely domestic policy difference. He published a  glowing essay praising Bernie 20 years ago, when he was just a teenager,  at an age and time when most people wouldn't have ever heard of Bernie.  Pete's father is a prominent European Socialist, just like Bernie.
2. Pete  speaks 7 languages and can learn a language in a few weeks, imagine him  speaking in fluent cantonese, russian, hindi or arabic (he is already  fluent) when traveling internationally. It would tremendously improve  the US's reach in directly relaying our new friendlier foreign policy to  billions of people worldwide who do not speak english.
3. I  want to see the look on MBS's and Putin's face when they have a welcome  a gay married man to their capitol and get pictures taken with a gay  man, in countries where being homosexual is illegal and would get a  person jailed or stoned to death.
4. He  is a rhodes scholar with experience in military intelligence and saw  combat first hand. He knows the sacrifice asked of soldiers sent  overseas and would know to avoid war at all costs.
5. Lincoln  picked his political opponents from the aisle to his cabinet. It was  instrumental in Lincoln being seen as a unifying figure.

fcp40q,jake63vw,PSA for California No Party Preference (NPP) Voters - Please Read,"**Please Read - California NPP Voters**

Hi All, if you are a California No Party Preference (NPP) voter, there are two ways that you can vote in tomorrow's Democratic Primary election.

There are 3.7M million California NPP voters that were sent a ballot without a presidential candidate, and will need to do one of the following in order to vote tomorrow. For both options, the following steps must be taken:

- Unfilled Ballot **AND** the envelope must be brought with you and turned in.
- One of the following two options must be performed.

**1) Ask for a Democratic Crossover Ballet**
The wording here is specific, poll-workers will only provide you a Democratic ballet if you specifically ask for a **Democratic Crossover Ballet** - if they do not hear the keyword **Crossover Ballet**, they have been instructed to not provide this ballet to you. This surprised me, as you'd figure asking for a Democratic ballet would suffice, but you must ask for a **Democratic Crossover Ballet** in order to vote. The state of California has asked that poll-workers not provide this ballot unless those very specific words are stated.


**2) Register for the Democratic Party**
This is another option, and can help if you're unsuccessful in getting a ballet tomorrow. You may register for the Democratic party at the polling location, and they will provide you a Democratic ballet. It's not a widely advertised option, but is an option they do support. I have heard you can register for the party for one day, just to cast your ballot, but haven't confirmed this.

Good luck everyone, and happy Super Tuesday.",2,1583209250,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fcp40q/psa_for_california_no_party_preference_npp_voters/,OurPresident,1

fclvib,EnterraCreator,"Hello, my name is Dustin. I am in $30,000 medical debt from being t-boned by a semi tractor trailer.","My day started as a normal day. I was headed to have my car repair because it had a small leak. On May 23, 2019, my life changed. 

My car lost control and I wound up wrapped around the front end of a semi. I should have died, by right. I had to be cut out surprisingly and taken to a trauma ER. 

My initial ER costs were $20,000. Between X-rays, different doctors, and mobility devices, the price tag increased substantially. I had many follow up doctor visits from infections from open wound, bone doctor for broken hip, and neurologist. Those prices have added up to another $10,000.

 The worst part of all this is I had to be out of work for over 3 months. My insurance dropped me because I couldn't pay my monthly contribution due to being out of work.

 I have long term debilitating migraines from my head going through my driver side window that isn't getting better. I am on daily medication that I can no longer afford. My bills didn't stop coming.

 As if now, I still haven't caught up my utility bills. I haven't been able to pay a cent towards my medical bills. I had to cash out my entire 401k just so I wouldn't lose my house or starve to death.

 I say all this because I wish none of this on any of you. Medicare for all is a human right. Something we need to survive. Something of no fault to me almost put me on the street homeless. 

We need this movement. We need Bernie Sanders as our next president to move into the future. Not only for us, but our children and grand children.

fckebw,hill_kitler,"Let's be clear: we do NOT believe ""they are staging a coup against Bernie"". We unequivocally REJECT that notion and if Joe Biden has more delegates going into the convention, we will accept that outcome.","Trump only wants to divide us. He wants us accusing each other of wild conspiracies. He wants the media to pick up on this rhetoric. He wants Bernie supporters to be viewed along the same lines as Trump supporters. He wants it to look like we're angry, pointing fingers, throwing accusations, name-calling, etc.

In other words he wants Bernie supporters to be viewed the same as Trump supporters (in the eyes of moderate democrats) BECAUSE HE FEARS BERNIE IN THE GENERAL.

Because Trump tweeted this, Bernie will now have to answer AGAIN for it at a debate, town hall or interview. Just like he had to answer for the supposed ""support"" from Putin and the BS ""Operation Chaos"". Trump knows exactly how to set a narrative and play the media. He's essentially saying ""Hey, media, Bernie and his supporters think there's a coup against him and they're mad! Bernie is the Trump of the left and his supporters are the maga of the left! Here's a talking point for you!""

I'd rather we go into the convention just behind Biden and lose the nomination that way than go into the convention as the front-runner but with no majority and have candidates' delegates pool together in round 2 to beat Bernie. The latter would look really bad and thankfully Pete, Amy &amp; Tom have dropped out before Super Tuesday which means that scenario won't play out.

fciv3d,HoEnder1,In appreciation of Elizabeth Warren as an ally of the Sanders movement,"TL;DR
Warren has been a boon to the progressive movement generally and the Sanders campaign specifically. Despite points of disagreement the vast majority of her actions demonstrate she is an ally of the movement Sanders is building and it would benefit us all to recognize her as such.
* Her ideological misteps/shortcomings are tiny compared to her seriousness and intensity in advocating progressive causes
* Her specificity in how to motivate change undercut implications that she's a closet establishment democrat
* Her plans have pushed the field overall to the left and increased the intellectual rigor overall
 * Fuck yes wealth tax.
* She runs interference for Sanders
* Her prescense balances the public discussion and normalizes Sanders
* She helps delegate math *in the case of brokered convention*
* Many of her supporters could go to non-Sanders campaigns, but while they're united under her they contribute their influence to strong progressive advocate.

Wall of text:

I periodically see hostility towards Warren on this sub which I think is frankly unreasonable. Most of this revolves around the idea that Bernie is the only progressive with a path forward and Warren is sabotaging his candidacy. The other major criticism is that she has somehow revealed herself to be a secret establishment plant, who doesn't believe in the principles she's advocated for. I not only believe these perspectives are warped and subjective, but I also believe the Warren has and continues to provide tangible benefits to the Sanders candidcay and, more importantly, the progressive movement overall.

To get the negatives out of the way: Candidates with conviction are not under any obligation to relinquish a race for president in the interest of ""grand strategy"". Politics and campaigns are incredibly unpredictable and any obvious strategy  critics might think compels another candidate to drop out is at best a weighted crap shoot. I believe Sanders would be the first one to advocate for the right of a political candidate to stand by their own version of policy and change, especially in the primary. If you agree with Sander's targets more than Warren's that's totally fair, but its not reasonable to criticize her right to run.

As for the argument that she is secretly an establishment-sympathizer: I'd agree there have been isolated incidents of ideological shortcoming during her campaign. However these are minutia when put against the scholarship and advocacy Warren did before politics, the extraordinary work she did to establish a framework to control financial predation, and the ideological resolve she showed holding the Obama administrations feet to the fire on consequential but low-key regulatory appointments.

More importantly for me, are what Warren has done; both for Bernie and the movement at large:

She came out the gates with the plans: Warren's plans are exceptional in their breadth and specificity. The first reason this matters is because it plants a stake in the ground. When progressive majorities gain control we will not have to scramble about to build policy from scratch, there is a strong foundation for almost any progressive goal that political will aligns for. The second reason is that I believe it drove many other campaigns, including Sanders, to do more legwork than they would have otherwise. Whoever wins, I believe they will have a far more robust framework to implement than they would have without her campaign. Moreover, these proposals have committed all the candidates to more leftward positions than would have been possible even 5 years ago (this shift is also one of Sander's most enduring legacies).  Warren was the first candidate to seriously advocate for a wealth tax, which in my opinion is the most significant policy proposal of this campaign session and which Sanders happily adopted. I could be wrong but I think she also led on free college as a serious priority.

She ran, and continues to run, interference for Sanders: We all saw the Bloomberg debate.  We probably all cheered and grew a little closer at the great public shaming of Michael Bloomberg. Sanders was the front runner, and despite being the obvious target was able to proactively advocate for his ideals, rather than sinking into the mud and inviting additional attacks. This was thanks to Warren taking the offensive role, one she performs with incisive mastery of detail. I honestly believe this benefitted not just specific campaigns, but the progressive movement as a whole by (modestly) shocking advocates of blatant corruption. Going forward Warren has shown she is laser focused on attacking in order: financial influence, milquetoast agendas, and vague promises. Only this last has occasionally bled into criticism of Sanders, but it is her least enthusiastic point and has never felt permanently damaging. 

She balances the scales against Biden and Bloomberg: At this point Biden is the dominant moderate.  Bloomberg is unique in that he cannot be compelled to give up his campaign. While there could be benefit to consolidating the progressive vote around Sanders, a 3-way race between these men would leave Sanders as the ""extreme"".  It allows the other two to paint Sanders as someone who is out of their mind and, while I believe Sanders has the political skill to handle such a position, I don't think it's advantageous. Warren's prescense creates more of a community and consensus around progressive policies. While Sanders defends himself, Warren can undercut the heartlessness and hypocrisy of the moderate position. I think this point in particular has gone underappreciated. It is not just a simple vote count, it is about creating a popular feeling that formerly ""radical"" ideas are actually what we collectively aspire to.

Warren could even help the delegate math: This is more speculative, but in the case of a brokered convention I would certainly rather have Warren with more delegates than Biden. It goes without saying that winning an outright majority is the grand prize, but it is reasonable to consider alternate scenarios. Democratic primary states award delegates based on percentage of votes *of candidates with &gt;15%*.  This means that if a state goes 40% Sanders and 20% Biden: Sanders gets 66% of delegates to Biden's 33%.  But if a state goes 35% Sanders, 15% Biden, 15% Warren then Sanders gets 53% of delegates, while the other two grab 23%.  Notice that Biden's share has dropped notably. While it may grate that your preferred candidate loses some of their lead, there is value in having allies grab a significant fraction of the pie.  

This brings me to my last point:  Warren supporters would *not* strictly go to the Sanders campaign. Consider the most recent developments of Buttigieg dropping out. I've been reading since the start of the race how much his supporters overlap with Warren. If she were not around, how many of these people go over Biden and how much worse would that be for Sanders' campaign?  Warren is capturing a lot of voters who have different priorities than some of the core Sanders constituencies.  Nevertheless, their support is giving additional volume to a candidate who loudly advocates for redistribution of power and a massive overhaul to American society.  This is great for both the Sanders campaign and for us as Americans

In conclusion, don't be mean friends. It's easy to pick apart someone based on specific details you don't like and think those flaws somehow reveal the true nature of a person. But I think the bulk of what a person fights for and says reveals the true nature of a person. Warren is an ally of the progressive movement and should be treated as such. And even if you don't want plan to vote for her it would benefit all of us to appreciate what she's contributed.",21,1583182709,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fciv3d/in_appreciation_of_elizabeth_warren_as_an_ally_of/,OurPresident,1

I was behind Mayor Pete this Dem nom season, but now as his campaign has announced its end, I’m left struggling to choose a candidate to vote for. My state is a Super Tuesday state and so I don’t have much time to prepare, but I’m going to do my best. 

This is what concerns me: Bernie has some very progressive platforms, and several of them wouldn’t even get all Dem votes, much less enough to get bipartisan support in order to implement the changes he wants without diluting them. I have tremendous respect for Bernie, and he’s been the same guy from the beginning of his career. What worries me is that he will be unapologetically firm on his platforms and not garner the support of those in the legislative branch in order to pass his ideas into law. 

Does anyone know what the Sanders campaign plan is relating to working with both sides in order to pass meaningful and supported legislation?

fchlic,creme_savers,Questions from a Pete supporter (long text post),"It was suggested that I post this as a separate question because it initially got deleted in the comment thread I asked it in, so here goes. I hope to get some genuine answers, as I say what I'm about to say in good faith.

I donated and voted to Sanders in the 2016 Dem primary because I saw him as genuine and committed to helping struggling Americans thrive, and had few doubts about his authenticity or motives. My ideas about policy have changed somewhat since then (part of why I liked Buttigieg), but I still appreciate the drive Sanders has to shift the political conversation leftward. Furthermore, I still appreciate his policy more than just about everything Trump and the GOP are putting forward, which is why I will vote for Sanders in November without doubt or hesitation if he is the nominee.

My question has more to do with the movement that supports Sanders, or the ""political revolution"" if you will. Ever since Hillary clinched the nomination, I have felt myself steadily growing apart from Bernie's movement. It began with the ""DNC rigged the primaries"" narrative, which I never really bought into, and quickly spiraled outward from there. I won't dig into details because I don't think re-litigating 2016+2020 thus far makes much sense, but suffice to say that over the past 4 years, I no longer feel at home in a political movement that (to me) seems readily defined by conspiracy theories, baseless/vicious attacks against people who *should* be allies, purity testing, and frankly an almost Trumpian cult of personality at times.

I want to be entirely clear about something, while we're at it - this behavior is certainly more visible online, and that online behavior should absolutely be taken with a grain of salt considering what we know about Russian interference, alt-right trolling, and whatever else. All of that said, I'm a young guy with plenty of young Sanders-supporting friends who I know IRL, and I've seen them behave in the manner I describe routinely and frequently. **I am confident that what I often see on Reddit and Twitter is not completely fabricated by disingenuous actors - I know some of these very vocal Sanders supporters IRL. They're not particularly unique, rare, or hard to find.**

That brings us to 2020. I am currently on the ""Vote blue no matter who"" train wholeheartedly, and that includes Sanders. The reason for this is that my primary political objective is removing Trump from the whitehouse, as I see him as a figure that fundamentally threatens American democracy. Thus, I am concerned that the political movement that Sanders has formed around him, having spent a lot of time and energy attacking Buttigieg and his supporters in a variety of ways, is not the best equipped to claim the WH in November. **While I am perfectly capable of putting my frustration with the most vocal Sanders supporters aside before entering the ballot box, I'm concerned that others won't be.**

Perhaps more importantly though, I'm torn on whether or not it's responsible to lend my support to a political movement that I see as very negative in tone. While I will disagree vehemently with anyone who tries to equate Sanders to Trump (and you can see me doing so in my comment history), or tries to equate their bases of support to one another (again, comment history), the fact remains that I do understand the comparison - Sanders-style populism might be fundamentally different from Trump-style populism... but I still see them both as populists, and I don't appreciate that fact about Sanders, nor do I appreciate the type of behavior it engenders among his base (i.e., I don't think billionaires are the root of literally every problem in America today, and scapegoating them for everything really doesn't sit well with me). **While I see Sanders as far and away a better influence on America than Donald Trump, I worry that supporting him in the primary lends credence to a movement that can, at it's absolute worst, rival the toxicity of Trump's.**

I guess I'm rambling a bit at this point, so I'll try to narrow it down to a specific question: In order to throw my weight behind Sanders, I'd want reassurance that I'm not adding my voice to a political movement that is prone to conspiracy theories and vicious ad-hominem against any challengers (especially those who . I'd want reassurance that people like Buttigieg (who I still like as a politician) are also welcome in the movement, and will not be cast to the side because they're ""bought by billionaires"" or ""CIA plants"". I want to know whether or not I'm allowed to disagree strongly with Sanders without being thought of as a ""paid shill"", ""moderate republican"", or ""fascist sympathizer"". I want to know whether or not I'll get banned, as I did in /r/sandersforpresident, for expressing my genuine belief that people like Bloomberg/Steyer are not just as bad as Donald Trump. **In short, what can y'all say to reassure me that this movement wants to unite the Democratic party in opposition to the GOP, rather than tear it apart? Am I welcome in this movement, even if my views differ in some ways from those of many Sanders supporters?**",8,1583177935,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fchlic/questions_from_a_pete_supporter_long_text_post/,OurPresident,1

Is there a difference between saying Pete has some troubling connections with corporate America, and calling Pete a corporate shill? Certainly there is for the last one, and probably the first as well. I think we may have been a bit zealous and a bit reductive, or at least I have.

In all practical terms it is down to Bernie and Biden, and my vote is cast for Bernie. If he does win the nomination, we are going to need the support of the other candidates and those who supported them. My concern is that we, not Bernie but his supporters, have been too harsh. I have seen a lot of criticism of other candidates and their positions become more focused on the candidates themselves. Whether or not there is practical difference between saying someone lied and calling them a lier, I think we do too much of the second. Now we need these people to support us, and I am worried we may have burned some bridges in the process, myself included.

At the very least, I will be considering my words more carefully in the future. I am going to try to focus more on the issues and less on the people.

fcdmzh,snack88,"Text of my Pete_Buttigieg outreach post, now deleted. Figured I'd post here in case people want something to modify, post elsewhere","I am from the UK. I have seen some of the rhetoric coming from both sides of this debate, and I'm firmly on the side of Bernie Sanders, in fact if anybody can really be described as a ""Bernie Bro"" I am it. I’ve been observing your primaries pretty much obsessively since they began. As many of you have done, I have mourned the dissipation of civility in politics. But I have also mourned, in my own system and in yours, the collapse of an assembled electoral left, and the rise of a myopic, brutal right.

As Pete Buttigieg supporters, you did what you had to do to win. When Pete made victory speeches many hours ahead of the results being counted, you supported him. When the powers-that-be smeared Sanders supporters as Russian bots, you supported that as well. Some of you will have had misgivings about having done so, maybe felt some unease. But it’s okay, because you did what you had to, to win. It’s not honourable, but sometimes, when you really believe in something, or someone, you have to fight dirty. The world is not divided neatly into Gryffindors and Slytherins and so on, as you know; Sanders supporters do not have a monopoly on that human tendency, any more than any of you do.

I’m not coming to you to apologise on behalf of the more militant Bernie Sanders supporters, who would be just as livid at the very idea of having me speak for them as many of you probably are at the idea of a foreigner sticking their nose in to your affairs. Those people – a broad coalition of white, hispanic and black; female, male, non-binary; gay, straight, and everything in-between – have witnessed the effectiveness of the Trump campaign, of its trolls, of its ‘bullying’, and have hardened themselves to match him. Many of you have been at the sharp end of that, I have seen that, and it is ugly; many of you, now, complain that you’ve seen worse treatment than any Trump supporter. If that is true – and I’m not entirely convinced that it is – then you have to take into account where we are in the campaign. The supporters of Trump will get theirs, I can tell you. It will be an absolute bloodbath, but a necessary one. And the trolls will engage the trolls, and the wonks will engage the wonks; the never-Trumpers will engage with the Democratic centre, and you’ll be grateful that there is a force of furious Bernie-Bros ready to keep the MAGA people at bay while you and you colleagues in the centre-right discuss policy.

Pete slammed the revolutionary politics of the 1960s, but during the 1960s the revolutionaries of Stonewall laid the foundations for what would become his campaign. This is the kind of sincerity and action that is needed to overthrow budding fascism in the US, and in my country as well. Sometimes, the lack of nuance can make us cringe, as I’m sure my sincere and undisguised attempt at outreach is doing for some of you now. But there is no such thing as a homophobic universal healthcare system; there is no such thing as a racist, sexist, transphobic, anti-semitic, or islamophobic universal healthcare system. I know, because I live in one. I can answer any of your questions on that score.

The abolition of ICE, the ending of the barbaric practice of separating children from their parents and forcing them to represent themselves in court, is an anti-, not pro-racist, and a pro-, not anti-civility initiative. These people have rights just as you and I, and they have just as much of a contribution to make as we do.

Free college will help to educate and enlighten the Trumpian masses we all detest right now, history having shown us that the best response to racism, sexism, and homophobia is a good tertiary education. The fact is that Trump was elected because he is the idiot’s idea of a rich person; gauche, gold-encrusted, and given to making preposterous zero-sum “deals” that no diplomat worth half a fuck would ever sign off on. This, as well as his personal incivility and that of his supporters, is not a coincidence.

We must be prepared to fight fire with fire, or, we will lose again, and there will be four more years of Trump – more, if he has any say in it. This is the only point on which I feel entitled to speak for others: his influence is empowering fascism in my country, as well as many others throughout Europe and the west. You have already seen the feedback loops begin; between Trump and Modi, Orbán, Zelensky; these budding international coalitions of fascists will ensure that you will have many more Trumps to come, introducing more inhumane policies which will, over time, come to be regarded as the norm, as indeed many of Trump’s policies have done today. This will finish off the cherished liberal consensus much faster than any ‘Russian bots’, and I say that as a democratic socialist.

I daresay that I won’t convince you to vote for Bernie Sanders in the primary, but please do have a sense of perspective about the challenges that we face, and please see that it is us, myself and you, that face them. The civility horse has bolted, it bolted in 2016; being sniffy about that now will pit a civil, upright, and no doubt quite decent candidate, with all kinds of well-costed plans and unimpeachable political acumen, against an angry far-right toddler who will annihilate them. And then we – and I include my countrymen in this as well -- will all have to deal with the consequences.

I am not here to kill you with kindness, I am not here to butter you up, win you over, radicalise you or turn you into a Bernie Bro, but I am here to humbly and sincerely plead with you to have a sense of perspective when you cast your votes -- tomorrow, but also in November. This is not a game, this is not a dinner party, this is not Reddit and Twitter, this is not ‘bots’ or ‘trolls’, it is people whose lives – I can say with zero hyperbole – hang on the results of this election.

fc7ox9,TextClick,The LA Sanders rally was amazing.,"I live within the LA metro, and after hearing about a Sanders rally on Thursday night, I got really excited, so I RSVPed after making sure that both me and my parents were available to drive me there.

I went there completely alone, and I got lost at first. However, after I found where the rally was being held, it was incredible. It was also my very first political rally ever. Standing in a hall packed to the brim with other energetic and passionate supporters really created an amazing atmosphere. I even lost my voice with all the constant cheering.

I loved what every speaker had to say. Chuy Garcia’s passionate speech about fighting for the betterment of Latin Americans. The nurses union leader calling Sanders an “honorary nurse”. Sarah Silverman delivering a heartfelt, passionate, and funny speech and saying that Bernie is “the right kind of Jew” and emphasizing the difference between Communism and Democratic Socialism. Dick Van Dyke wholesomely expressing his support for Bernie, even adorably losing his train of thought at one point and reflecting on his vote for Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 50s. A cofounder of Black Lives Matter saying that we need to fight against systemic racism and racial violence in the criminal justice system. Bernie commanding the room with a clear and booming voice when discussing his usual issues. An incredibly bombastic performance by Public Enemy Radio.

I loved it, though I’m still disappointed that I didn’t actually get to see Bernie with that huge crowd.",1,1583129040,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fc7ox9/the_la_sanders_rally_was_amazing/,OurPresident,1

He fucked up the delegates in the end. Its gonna be really imbalanced from now on... This almost feels like sabotage in a way from Pete. He'd rather divide the party than keep it together. No consideration for others running or voters.

So, if you live in one of the states where early voting already happened,  BE SURE TO VOTE and make your loved ones,  kids old enough go vote, your grandpa with dementia,  Whatever it takes, GO VOTE for Bernie if they haven't already.

fc675e,SovietWinnebago,A few questions about Bernie's chances,"So I have a few questions. I’ve been following the democratic race since around mid November and it’s been exciting to see Bernie come out as strong as he has been and seeing the wild support for him. As we get closer to the election and with Super Tuesday coming up, I honestly can’t make heads or tails of the whole situation. I trying to see if someone who more closely follows the race or who understands data/trends better than I do can shed some light on this.

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are the chances of the DNC backing up Bernie over someone else?
2. What are the chances of a DNC backed Bernie becoming president?
3. What are the chances of a non DNC backed Bernie becoming president?
4. Is it possible that too many democratic candidates could pollute the voting pool and possibly take votes away from Bernie costing him the election? Or is his base strong enough that it wouldn’t matter?
5. Lastly, with the amount of support we’ve seen for Bernie and how well he’s done in the polls, is it possibly at this point for another candidate (cough cough Biden) to come out from under him and completely overtake him not unlike what Hillary Clinton did in 2016?

&amp;#x200B;

Margaret didn't even seem surprised, just smiled and started talking to the other person.

fc5w63,utopian238,We Must Strive To Be A Welcoming Movement,"Hey guys, with Pete dropping out of the race I was reminded of something we've been told time and time again by Bernie. We can and should hold ourselves accountable for how we treat other voters online and in person. We all bristle at the BernieBro narrative and there are a fair number of Trumpsters out there larping as Berners but it's up to us to hold ourselves accountable where we can. Please remember that every single person you talk to online is a fellow human being.

When talking to a Buttigieg supporter I received the following message.

""Hi. I'm sure you understand that although many of us Pete supporters would love to continue to advocate for the values of Pete's campaign that we quite frankly do not feel welcomed just anywhere. Just like you can't solve the problem of Sanders supporters constantly attacking us, you also aren't going to be able to single-handedly create a welcoming space for us. I'm personally rather alligned with Sanders policy-wise, but still find myself feeling excluded and that's a major issue that I think the Sanders campaign needs to have an intercommunity discussion about.""

He's absolutely right. We need to remember that another person is on the opposite side of every message we type. We can have policy disagreements and we can vehemently disagree with people but there is no place in our movement for hate or vitriol.

You remember how angry and hurt you felt after everyone told you to fall in line and vote Hillary in 2016? Ask yourself if your actions are going to cause them to feel that same pain. There is no reason for it, we are fighting to become the future of the Democratic Party and in order to achieve that we must be creating a place where all voters from the coalition feel safe and accepted. We're not here to make anyone feel the same way we felt. We're here to break the wheel and reforge the coalition.

I'm not saying you have to accept Biden or Klobuchar or agree to a single one of their policies. All i'm saying is remember that every single one of their voters has a place in our movement. And at the end of the day if they don't join us we are still fighting for healthcare for every single one of them. We are fighting for healthcare for every single Trump voter. We are here to make sure that everyone sees that Labor Dems can be leaders again. We need them as much as they need us, there is no majority without both Neolibs and Labor votes. It's time to begin to mend the fractured Democratic Coalition and it's up to us to take the first steps.

So please everyone let's talk about how we as a community can do better. How we individually can do better. As the race tightens up it's more important now than ever that this is a welcoming space. Do your best to be an example not just a vote.",6,1583119731,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fc5w63/we_must_strive_to_be_a_welcoming_movement/,OurPresident,1

fc3lg1,Holts70,(X-post) To everyone brigading other candidate's subs: STOP,"I almost never make my own threads, let alone x-post, but I think this is very important.

I just got back from taking a peek at the Buttigieg sub, and a lot of them are completely turned off by Sanders not because of his policies, but because some of you guys thought it would be clever to talk shit over there. Half the posts are about how people aren't going to vote for Bernie because of brigading. It's not a good look.

We have a responsibility to be gracious in both victory and defeat. Sanders himself disavowed that kind of negative behavior, and there's no reason we should lose even one converted voter over someone trolling another candidates sub, especially after they drop out.

To any Buttigieg, Steyer, or any other candidate's supporters out there, please don't let the actions of a few kids sway you away from Bernie. If you don't like his policy, great! Vote for whomever you want. But I think it's a real shame on a couple of levels if negative memes and brigading cost us even single vote, and I hope everyone on all sides understands that.
Again, we're not all like that. There's a big difference between being critical of other candidates in our own sub, and going to someone else's sub and being an actual detriment to Bernie's campaign. If you actually respect what Bernie is trying to do, you wouldn't do this, and if you are doing it or have done it in the past, please stop.

fc3jbj,DicksB4Chicks,Make no mistake - Buttigieg dropping out hurts our chances even if a plurality of his supporters go to Bernie. We must work harder,"TLDR: Bernie will get a higher percentage of the votes now, but likely less delegates because more candidates will reach 15% viability, especially in California

The betting markets certainly reflect this. Bernie lost 5% for the nomination overall and suffered much bigger losses in Massachusetts and Minnesota.

Even though the latest morning consult poll shows that Bernie is the most popular second choice by a slim margin among Pete supporters, this is likely to reduce the number of delegates Bernie will win on Super Tuesday. Let me explain.

Bernie was going to make viability in every state. With so many in the race, a lot of candidates would not reach 15%. Now that Pete has dropped out, even if a plurality of his supporters go to Bernie, a lot more candidates will make 15% across ST states. So even though Bernie will surely get higher percentages now, it's very likely he will get less delegates because he will have to split them amongst additional candidates reaching that threshold.

California is a perfect example. Before Pete dropped out, there was a real chance that Bernie could be the only one to reach 15% statewide and in most congressional districts and take home the lion's share of delegates. Now it's likely that two or more candidates will reach that threshold and Bernie could end up with less than half of those delegates.

So the ideal scenario would probably be a one-on-one between Bernie and one of the centrist, second best scenario would be a sufficiently crowded field where Bernie reaches viability in all states while many other candidates do not, and the worst case is a sweet spot in the middle where a lot of candidates reach viability and it's still crowded enough to make it difficult to rack up a ton of delegates. Unfortunately it appears we are now in this sweet spot.

There have even been reports that Klobuchar was asked to stay in to block Bernie in Minnesota and Warren was asked to stay to block Bernie and Massachusetts and because she siphons the most votes from him.

The good news is that Bernie probably still has the best chance of winning the most delegates. The bad news is that he is now even less likely to reach a majority. All of the other candidates and the vast majority of superdelegates have made it clear that they would risk intra-party damage to deny Bernie the nomination if he has the most delegates but not a majority.

fc2r2k,stretchmarx20,Question about wall street tax,"I read an article questioning the accuracy of Bernie’s revenue estimate generated from the wall street tax. The article clearly had a conservative/neoliberal bias, but I don’t know enough about economics to debunk it. The main point is that when you tax transactions, you lower stock prices and thus shrink the economy. Less economy to tax ends up resulting in less total tax revenue than before. 

The other point is that Bernies estimate of what we can pull in per year is mathematically impossible. Total profits for the entire financial sector (which includes all finance: auto insurance like Geico and the rest, it’s not just Wall Street) are a shade under $400 billion. We’re going to raise in tax revenue near all of the profits from the entire financial sector just by taxing Wall Street? That’s mathematically impossible. Is the author doing something sneaky here or what?


&gt;We know that taxing transactions lowers the price of stocks. This is the same as saying it raises the price of capital to corporations. A higher cost of capital leads to less investment and that in turn leads to a smaller economy. Given that Uncle Sam gets around 35% of the economy each year if the economy is smaller by, say, 1% at some future date then Uncle Sam will be getting 0.35% of GDP less in tax. If the economy is that 1% smaller as a result of the FTT then tax revenues are about 0.35% of GDP smaller than they would have been in the absence of the tax.


&gt;The European Union’s estimates were that the economy would be 1.75 to 2% smaller after the FTT than it would have been without it. So, using that tax revenues for the US would be roughly 0.7% of GDP less after the FTT. But, of course, we need to add the actual revenues from the FTT itself. But that $340 billion (that number we already know is vastly too high) is some 0.2% of GDP. So, we gain 0.2% of GDP from the FTT and lose 0.7% from the effects of the FTT.

We must all be prepared for the inevitable. The media from now on is gonna be harder than ever on Bernie, wanting to consolidate an overall victory for Biden. We must push against this agenda and make sure to counter-attack with positive messages and good propaganda for Bernie Sanders.

I’m not, and I can’t stress this any stronger, suggesting to use the misogynistic tactics of the so-called ”Bernie Bros.""  We need to be smart about this, and not create more hostile propaganda on our movement than what it’s already out there.

We should try to coordinate to make a strong and united message to advance the causes and policies that are ingrained within Bernie’s (and our) core message and campaign.

Let me know your thoughts... we could even create common ads and messages to publish in our social media to make a united front.",5,1583072411,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fbunhi/be_prepared_for_the_ugliness_thats_coming_our_way/,OurPresident,1
fbulu9,_Stefanski_Androos_,When people on social media say Bernie can't pay for M4A - you can use this,"I am constantly seeing posts on social media saying ""Bernie has no plan to pay for it!"" ""Bernie's explanations are just incoherent ramblings!"" Or flat out lies like ""Bernie's plan will cost $10 trillion dollars and his plan to tax the rich which will only get $800 billion, where's the rest coming from? The poor and the middle class, that's where!""

&amp;#x200B;

So I started responding and got to this response that I now just copy &amp; paste. It's long, but pretty thorough and has actually helped turn a few people around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here it is if any of you want to use it: 

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

The cost of our current health care system is approximately $5.2 trillion a year. M4A would reduce this by roughly $500 billion bringing the annual cost to $4.7 trillion a year. Not only is M4A half a trillion dollars cheaper each year but it will also cover the 37 million Americans with no coverage and the 41 million more with inadequate coverage. 

&amp;#x200B;

People understand paying for this would not literally be ""free"". Yes, taxes will go up to pay for a portion of it. Under Bernie's plan I will be paying an additional $1,112 in taxes to cover M4A. Compare this to my current plan which costs me $3,000 a year in premiums with a $2,500 deductible.. $1,112 for full coverage beats $3,000 for insurance that kicks in only after I lay down another $2,500 and even then will only cover hospitals and doctors within my network. Not to mention the fact that my $1,112 in taxes won't cover just me, but help to make sure all my family and friends who currently can't afford any or adequate insurance right now are covered as well. That's a damn good deal if you ask me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Beside the 4% income based tax I just laid out, he has several more plans to cover the rest - a tax increase on the insanely rich, 7.5 percent income-based premium paid by employers (saving them an average of $10,000 per employee compared to the premiums they pay now), and more that you can find on his website. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pair his plan to pay for it with the money saved by getting rid of private health insurance (slashing $400 billion in administrative costs, $100 billion in profits) and we can account for all the funds needed to cover M4A with a surplus of $50 billion each year.. He's got it more than covered. 

&amp;#x200B;

The government will save money, the average working class families and individuals will save money, the insanely rich will pay a little more, but they'll still be insanely rich, and everybody will be covered. Some people stand up for the rich, but I sympathize with the sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, grandparents, and friends that can't afford care when they need it most.

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

This sub has been an amazing source of motivation and inspiration to keep fighting for Bernie, so thanks for that!

I’m broke so I can’t exactly fight back monetarily, and volunteering has been great but still leaves me wanting to do more. 

I also make Bernie themed music and I came up with a simple way to make some extra money for Bernie. All it costs us is a few seconds before bed...

It’s really simple, just:

1. Stream my song “BERNIE SANDERS” (https://sptfy.com/4QdA) on Spotify on repeat every night while you sleep from now til the end of March (I’ve found it easier to remember by setting an alarm around bedtime).

Spotify pays per stream (about 250 streams = $1) and all earnings will be donated to Bernie 2020! One person streaming every night for the full month would generate around $35-40.

2. Follow my Spotify profile, then save and add the song to a playlist. This will trigger the algorithm to push the song even more (and generate more donations)

3. Tell a couple friends and get them onboard!

I also made a little site with more info: Stream4bernie.com 

I’ll be posting weekly progress updates and proof of the donation once it’s made on my Instagram: @tracetheprophet

Thank you! And let’s go win this thing :)",1,1583033625,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fbo90n/want_to_generate_money_for_bernie_while_you_sleep/,OurPresident,1

fblsc3,_Stefanski_Androos_,Trump is calling on Republicans to vote for Bernie to give the superdelegates a reason to pick another candidate,"I've been seeing articles all over the internet about how Trump has been calling on his supporters to vote for Bernie because he is the ""weakest candidate."" Moral and ethical issues aside, I'm not buying this reasoning. Polls have consistently shown that Bernie has the best chance of beating Trump when compared to the other Democratic nominees. The polls also show a higher chance of a contested convention over Bernie actually getting a majority and clinching the nomination outright. 

The superdelegates have expressed that they are definitely considering taking the nomination from Bernie if it comes to a contested convention, even if he has a plurality of pledged delegates. Obviously there has been a lot of backlash and media coverage about how this would break up the Democratic Party, handing Trump the election.. So the pressure is on and only getting stronger for them to pick Bernie if he has a plurality but not the majority.

 I think that Trump IS afraid of Bernie because he DOES have the highest chance of beating him in a general election, and he is getting worried that the superdelegates are going to give him the nomination. Because of this he is calling on his supporters to vote for Bernie, knowing full well it's not going to make a huge impact on the results. It may help Bernie a little but it's not going to cause landslide victories unless they were already going to happen. The results will likely be the same - Bernie wins a plurality but not a majority.

The difference?

Now the superdelegates have a totally justified reason to pick another candidate when it inevitably comes to a contested convention. They can say, ""Sure, Bernie may have had the most votes, but the Republicans rigged the election. The popular vote has been corrupted, and thus the pledged delegates. We aren't taking away the will of the People by voting against them, we're balancing the chaos the Republicans caused and picking who we think is the rightful candidate for the Democratic Party.""

They now have a reason to pick another candidate that isn't just ""We think we know better than you"" and the nomination is given to another candidate with a lower likelihood of beating Trump, and much, much lower after they take the nomination away from Bernie.",4,1583022058,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fblsc3/trump_is_calling_on_republicans_to_vote_for/,OurPresident,1

fbith0,Spank-Those-Hams,Are there any sources to help defend Bernie's platform? Explanation in post.,"My dad is a Republican, but a good guy nonetheless. Earlier he and my brother were having a friendly discussion about Medicare for all, which my brother finds to be a compelling point of his platform, and I wholeheartedly agree. 

My dad argues that it would have to come out of our taxes. I'm also seeing online that corporate welfare comes from our taxes, which seems to be a strong counterpoint. I'm still researching it, but I've heard this discussed, and quite frankly it seems hypocritical that this is supported, but people just wanting basic healthcare are moochers in the eyes of some people. 

I'm working on defending that point, but I guess I'm just asking how I can get started on political research. 

I'm new to politics, but quite frankly, I'm tired of seeing a good guy like Bernie Sanders be dragged through the mud as a crazy idealist. It seems to me that he's the only trustworthy guy in the race. The rest of them are basically oligarchs with extra steps. 

I hate seeing my friends and peers failing to afford healthcare. I'm tired of seeing ""uplifting"" posts about sick kids being soooooo lucky because their lifesaving GoFundMes are succeeding. I'm tired of seeing my fucking MOTHER struggling to pay for expensive ass medicine, while her abusive asshole boss doesn't even give her, a member of management, dental or optical. 

I'm tired of seeing this shit and more. People with money being able to kick the little guy. This fuckhead president embarrassing our country. 

I want to be educated, to know what I'm talking about, and I'm sorry for rambling, but I just wonder if theres a good place to get started becoming informed.",3,1583009227,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fbith0/are_there_any_sources_to_help_defend_bernies/,OurPresident,1

Bernie is holding a rally in San Jose **on Sunday at** 1:30. The doors open at 11:30. I've never been to one of his rallies or any rally for that matter. Usually these seem to be held inside, but this one seems to be outside.

Anyway, I know Bernie's rallies tend to draw *huge* crowds. Any advice on how early I'd realistically need to be there? I also need time to find parking (preferably free) and walk / take transportation to the venue.

Also, will I be allowed to bring any food / anything?

And will I get to talk to Bernie and ask to take a selfie with him?

And will the rally hand out any stickers or shirts? I'd love to sport some Bernie gear!",9,1582952103,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fb7l7o/how_early_do_i_need_to_be_to_actually_get_into/,OurPresident,1

fb63p8,vomitisnatureslube,I'm a little dissapointed in you all,"In 2016 we went into vrtually every damn state with the polls telling us we would lose.  What did we do? We fought, we kept the hope and we gave it everything we had. Sometimes, well, sometimes we still lost. But damn, did we eat into those leads. Others, we won, despite everyone and their mothers telling us it couldnt happen. Michigan was an especially suprising night. 20 point behind in the polls, you say? Well, this is the Sanders campaign. We dont take polls, we break 'em!

Roll in 2020. For damn near a year, weve been the underdog. Biden had nice chunky leads just about everywhere you looked. Everyone told us that Bernie was Old News. It was all about Big Joe Biden and that charming young Mayor. We were yesterdays people. And what did we do? We fought, tooth and nail, for every vote, in our home state, in the state next door- hell, thousands of you travelled thousands of miles to hit the streets for Bernie in Iowa, in NH, in NV. And what did it get us? Three states, three wins, and as of the start of this week we were in touching distance of Moldy Joe down in SC. I've never felt prouder of this movement.


So, heres my question, gang- *what in the hell happened to the lot of you?*

In the space of a week weve gone from dreamers, fighters, *the ones that move*, the ones who bring the impossible into reality, into a bunch of shrewd, cynical cowards willing to admit defeat before a damn vote is cast! Suddenly, Dead Joe Walking is the invincible titan once more, set to pound us to mush in SC and we may as well all just go home. To read the posts and comments around here these last few days has felt like stepping into a parallel reality where all the Berners have been switched out for hand wringing centrist lickspittles! Suddenly, were all naive idiots for thinking there was ever a hope of victory in SC, Bidens just too good at this
 (*HAH!*). Gone were the legions of travelling doorknockers. Gone was the sense of urgency, the endless phonebanking pushes, the feel-good posts from the boots on the ground.


Really, Berners? Who are we? Is this us? A mere week as the frontrunners and we go full Biden? The army of inaction? We have an opportunity tomorrow to END THE WHOLE DAMN THING! We go 4/4, take Bidens prize jewel right out of his crown, and ride an unstoppable wave to 51% of delegates. Thats whats at stake, folks! Five days ago, that didnt seem so impossible. Now it does. 

Well, this is team Sanders, damnit! Impossible victory is our signature move! Its not too late to change the tide- canvas, if youre close, pick up that phone if youre not- and even if we give this everything and still lose, well, we can be proud that we fought for every last vote! We can be proud that we had the chance of an early victory in our sight and didnt back away from it! Sure, there will be other chances to end this thing between now and convention, but if we are content to wait for the safer chance, to ""fall back"" to our s
trongholds like Biden did, then Bidens fate awaits us too. This is the fight of our lives! You see an opening, you take the swing! If you dont, the next punch is coming straight for your teeth!

If you are in another party you must re-register as a Democrat at a polling station!  Then you request a regular Democratic party ballot.  The best thing for everyone to do according to Jane Sanders is to register as a Democrat as a polling station and vote a regular Democratic party ballot.  You can change back the next day.  Try not to vote by mail since that is a window for vote-stealing.  WATCH you ballot go into the box with your own eyes at a polling place.  Take a picture of your full ballot.

faz58g,Yugi-Mon,Bernie's brand management.,"Let me start off by saying that I fully support Bernie and his policies, and I plan on voting for him in my state's primaries as well as the general election. However, I feel that he has incorrectly branded himself as a Democratic Socialist when in fact he is a Social Democrat. 


Socialism is defined as ""a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole."" i.e. an economy run by everyone, as opposed to private enterprises. Social democracy, on the other hand, ""is an ideology that has similar values to socialism, but within a Capitalist framework."" Bernie does not want to put an outright end to Capitalism; He's merely seeking to establish more just social programs and fair laws that distribute the success and profits of our economy more evenly to all of us involved. I support this ideology 100%, but branding it as Socialism has scared the older generation who have seen firsthand the negative effects of Communism throughout the world, as well as moderates from the States which will ultimately swing this election one way or the other. (The electorate needs to be expaned, but that's a discussion for another time)


Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is that like any truly inspirstional person in history, Bernie should focus on uniting us as a whole, even those of us who might not necessarily see eye-to-eye with one another. Appealing to moderates is key to winning the election, and if he labelled himself as a Social Democrat as opposed to a Democratic Socialist, then people from the other side would be that much more willing to support future President Sanders and send the orange man running back inside his ebony tower.

fayww8,butternutjob,Mobilizing poll watchers in CA primaries for data collection,"Let's say I'm powerful and I want to influence the primary election in California away from an anti-establishment candidate.

Say I have access to some knobs to influence the tally of votes - (e.g. the developers of the ballot counting software can stick in a few lines of code to nudge some votes this or that way for some $)  Say I have access to the database of registered voters, and can introduce ""glitches"" so that some people receive more provisional ballots (which will be counted \*after\* the regular ballots)

Consider this:

Higher income areas more likely vote the ""correct"" way, that is, for an establishment candidate.  They are more likely to live in the corporate news bubble, and like their life the way it is.  I really don't want to mess too much with their ballots.

Folks in lower income areas are more likely to see through the noise of corporate media, resonate with this anti-establishment candidate, and would have much more to gain from this candidate from winning.  I'd sure prefer those folks didn't vote so much, but if they do, it'd be better for my knob-turning if they got provisional ballots.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, call me crazy, but it seems to me that I WOULDN'T want folks going out to the polls on election day, collecting data about the number of provisional ballots given out, and then searching for an inverse correlation between median income for the zip code and percentage of provisionals given out.

What do folks think?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

Perhaps I should have put out this inquiry \*before\* going to the trouble of creating a video and subreddit... but putting the cart before the horse is not uncommon for me...

I also think there’s a massive disinformation campaign currently underway to keep that from happening.","I recently tried to post a warning about disinformation in all the Democratic subreddits. R/sandersforpresident took it down, claiming it was unrelated to his campaign.  Since then, it's been confirmed that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election and that Bernie’s campaign is being targeted.  So, I’m trying again on here.  In my post I theorized that their objective would be to turn Democrats against each other.  [Apparently I’m not the only one who thought so.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/f8w3sf/do_the_russians_want_bernie_to_win_not_really/)

Can we all please not fall for that?  Say what you will about the DNC and the media, but I don’t know of a single Democratic *voter* who doesn’t want quality healthcare and education for everyone, major reductions in wealth inequality, and massive, sustained efforts to fight climate change.  **The disagreements are over how to actually get there.**  Please don’t lose sight of that.  Moderates aren’t evil corporate shills for worrying that a progressive proposal might be too unrealistic, and progressives aren’t violent extremists for worrying that a moderate proposal might be too ineffective.          

Because if we *do* lose sight of that then the *actual* evil corporate shills and violent extremists will take this country away from us.  While Democrats were busy arguing over who actually won the Iowa Cacus, the GOP was busy acquitting Trump of his crimes in the Senate and [forbidding the Justice Department from conducting any “politically sensitive” investigations without William Barr’s personal approval.](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/06/803506238/attorney-general-barr-issues-new-rules-for-politically-sensitive-investigations)    

This election is our **last** chance to stop them.  Whatever else happens, the Democrats MUST win control of congress, and as many state legislatures as they can.  This is a  census year which means *the voter districts get redrawn this year.*  Whoever controls the state legislatures and congress in 2020 will control that process.  If the Democrats win, they can undo the [GOP gerrymandering from 2010.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-power-that-gerrymandering-has-brought-to-republicans/2016/06/17/045264ae-2903-11e6-ae4a-3cdd5fe74204_story.html)  But if the GOP wins, they’ll double and triple it, until the Democrats are shut out of power completely.  

Winning that battle is going to take every last voter we can find.  For what it’s worth, I think a progressive/moderate coalition with Bernie leading it is the best way to find them.

faos4a,emmett22,The Marginal Cost of The Sanders Plan.,"One thing I do not get with all the criticism of the Sanders plan (Not only healthcare but all of it) Numbers like 50-60 Trillion over 10 years have been thrown around. Surely the marginal cost is not going to be 60 Trillion. People are already paying for healthcare, education, student loans, daycare etc. so why repeat some high number that does not reflect the actual increase (if any)

I get his plan it to expand all of these services so more people then already pay for them, can have access to these services. So my question is, obviously we are going to have to spend more than we are, but how much more, after you deduct what we already are paying and the inherent savings of economies of scale? Not to mention the economic impact of basically transferring wealth from the few to the many, who have a bigger propensity to spend, a healthier, more educated population and fewer stay-at-home parents? Is this an impossible equation to answer?

Sanders plan-What we spend today on these services=X?
Then X-External economic impact of wealth distribution, better educated and healthier population that can afford to have kids=XX?
It think it would be more interesting to know X and XX, and maybe the cost per patient instead of some un-relatable number in the trillions.",1,1582862515,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/faos4a/the_marginal_cost_of_the_sanders_plan/,OurPresident,1

Barrack Obama.

Buttigieg would be lost, because he keeps arguing with OnStar and his GPS, neither of which can understand what he's saying.  ""Water is wet because hot is fire does not compute... Rerouting...""  but at least he's driving a nice red sedan loaned to him by Uncles Billionaires.

Klobuchar would be comfortably resting in the driver's seat of a nice red soccer mom minivan, being towed along by a big red towtruck with a 4 cylinder engine.

Biden would be day drunk-driver driving into opposing traffic, in a red SUV, trying to wreck every affordable car that he can come across, screaming slurring words out the window, ""I have NO empathy!""  Bumper sticker reading: Obama is my Co-Pilot!

Bloomber, last and least would be, driving a red giant SUV/Tank. Last only because that the crew building his new highway bypass to the presidency can't build the road in front of him fast enough.  But he's fixing that by hiring more bypass workers.  In the rear window, where people display families as icons, are black, brown, red, and yellow stick figures covering it all, with red X's Crossing through each one of them, keeping score...

While far beyond them all, rides Bernie. Top down in the equivalent of a blue electric version of a Shelby. Wind in his face, listening to Jim Croce's ""Big Bad Leroy Brown"".  He can't see out the back window, because his family covers it all in those silly stick figures they paste there. Every color and Creed, every gender and every race.  Every sexuality. This is his family. And while happily married, these are the children of his Lady. And he's a jealous man for his Lady.  And her kids.

falupw,Lumelore_,How would you convince an older person to vote for Bernie Sanders?,"Earlier today I heard my grandma trying to convince my older sister not to vote for Bernie. I have no idea if she was successful though. The reason she doesn't like Bernie is because she thinks it's impossible to fund medicare for all, tuition free college, and etc. She also thinks young people shouldn't have access to free or reduced priced medical care because they ""haven't worked enough yet"". She thinks it will cause the united states to have no money and she won't listen to statistics or anything. I can't think of a reason off the top of my head that would convince someone of her age and stubbornness. I will be 17 by the time the election happens so unfortunately I can't vote. But I am closeted trans and I know I will be going into a lot of debt when I become an adult due to surgeries and paying for college and other medications and with the ridiculous healthcare costs in the united states I am worried about how hard it will be to have a place of my own since my parents won't like me being trans. I really want to stay in the united states because I love the climate and geography here. I have plenty of reasons why I want Bernie for president and I know my life will be even harder if he doesn't win. However, I can't think of a reason why my grandma would want Bernie though, especially since she won't believe any statistics or anything, for example she thinks there are no countries currently in the world with universal healthcare. I have tried to explain that there are many countries with it, but she thinks I'm lying.",2,1582849368,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/falupw/how_would_you_convince_an_older_person_to_vote/,OurPresident,1

fak0bx,professor_fatass,Dear DNC leadership and superdelegates:,"I am just one person with just one vote.  In the grand scheme of things I am pretty unimportant.   I am also not someone who you probably care about, given that I registered as a Republican at 18 years of age and voted that way for most of my life.  

In 2016 I watched the primaries play out in both parties.   I was at that point still a Republican.  I was not enthusiastic about Trump but that is who ended up on top.  I had become increasingly disillusioned with the GOP over the years.  I felt like they were not standing for what I thought they should.  I was interested in what was happening in ""libtard"" land.  I had watched the DNC sabotage Bernie with all the talk about how Hillary had too much support and it was impossible for anyone else to win.  I didn't know much about Bernie but I knew I wasn't voting for Hillary.  

So, I held my nose and voted for Trump.  Hindsight being what it is I now deeply regret that decision.  I figured that the RNC hated Trump so at worst he would be a 4 year placeholder without much getting done because nobody would agree with anyone about anything.  

Since then I came to my senses.  I quit the Republican party and without major changes there I will possibly never vote (R) again.  I joined the Democrat party less than a year ago specifically to vote for Bernie this time around.  I did not join the DNC.  I joined Bernie.  

If Bernie ends up getting a strong plurality of votes in the primaries and is passed over for the nomination I will quit the Democrats too.  I will write in Bernie.  Trump did not single handedly destroy the party of Lincoln, but he is the one that nuked the wreckage to ensure the old Republican party will not return.  I honestly hope the DNC does not do to their own party what Trump did to the one he currently pays lip service to.  But if they tell voters that our votes do not matter, they should not be surprised when we don't vote for whatever puppet they throw up.

If Bernie is the one with the most votes he must be the nominee.  Same for Warren or Biden or whoever.  I am a Bernie supporter but I will likely vote for whoever wins the nomination as long as they win fairly.  If someone with less votes is selected, then Democrats will have lost any ability to say anything about the electoral college because ""do as I say not as I do"" isn't going to fly.

I don't know if that made any sense.  I was rambling I'm sure.  It's just my two cents.",5,1582841648,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fak0bx/dear_dnc_leadership_and_superdelegates/,OurPresident,1

fahf9b,a_vennan,Questions for Bernie supporters,"Bernie recently released a plan on how he's going to pay for all his plans. Can you guys, as Bernie supporters, answer these for me?

1. Bernie wants to tax Wall Street speculation to pay for free college. If you tax Wall Street speculation, trades will stop being profitable. Foreign and domestic investors will stop investing in the American stock market, and stock market itself will crash. Investment in business will plummet, and businesses will suffer. This will lead to them laying off workers, which will hugely raise unemployment. This is NOT a far fetched theory - it is a chain of events that is basically fact. **Banks and the stock market keep businesses of all sizes running.** No investor will invest when his profits are cut down by a significant percentage. How is this not a problem? Not to mention that once the stock market crashes, the speculation tax will not bring in the promised 2.4 trillion, How will Bernie pay for free college then?
2. To quote Bernie's campaign site on how to pay for housing for all:

&gt;The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for singles.  
Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class.

The wealthy simply will not stay in America and watch their money trickle away. It's extremely easy, when you're that rich, to get investor visas in other countries like Switzerland. They will relocate, and take their business and investments and capital with them. How will Bernie pay for housing for all then?

3)

&gt;Bernie has introduced [a proposal](https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/eliminating-medical-debt/) to eliminate all of the $81 billion in past due medical debt held by 79 million Americans. It is fully paid for by establishing an income inequality tax on large corporations that pay CEOs at least 50 times more than average workers.

Do you really think it is unfair to pay a CEO with years of experience more than an average worker? Is this something companies should be penalized for?

4) Why do you guys always cite the bank bailouts as evidence of something being screwed up in America? If America had not bailed out the banks, the country would have been thrown into another Great Depression. The common man would have suffered. All of America's economy relies on banks. Besides, they paid back all the money WITH interest in just four months. It actually made the American taxpayer a lot of money.

Also, even assuming all these taxes work, his sum total revenue still does not add up to the 60 trillion that all of his ideas will cost. How do you think he will pay for them?

Lastly: How do you think Bernie will pass all these plans? Congress needs to approve it, and Bernie has had history as a Senator of not getting his proposal passed. He has been ranked one of the least effective Senators in the whole Senate. Most Senators do not support his ideas.",3,1582831780,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fahf9b/questions_for_bernie_supporters/,OurPresident,1

fadpgf,obvioslymispeledfake,What if Bernie Sanders is on the ballot as the Green Party candidate?,"There's been lots of talk of the DNC trying to steal the nomination from the candidate with the most votes in favor of the special interest that they are beholden to.

Now, if Bernie is guaranteed to be on the presidential ballot as a 3rd party candidate, say the Green Party, which I read is lead by a fan of Bernie, the establishment won't be able to put anyone else under the Democratic party because that will inevitably lead to their demise.

If the ballot contains Trump, Bloomberg AND Sanders the Democratic party will likely come in 3rd, and most certainly will NOT win the nomination (I'd think Trump wins this kind of an election) and that will undoubtedly be the END of the Democratic party as we know it. And they aren't THAT suicidal. I hope. So just having this threat to them looming will force them to nominate Bernie Sanders. 

Is that a possibility at all?

Can we get him on a 3rd party platform that will be on the ballot in all 50 states regardless of what the elites on the DNC decide?",10,1582817277,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fadpgf/what_if_bernie_sanders_is_on_the_ballot_as_the/,OurPresident,1

So my fear is this in analogous to Jeremy Corbyn in the UK - fantastically  popular with his base, way further left than the previous Labour leaders, yet when it came to win a general election over a dreadful Conservative party that had made a real mess of the country, he failed dismally. His popularity with his base did not outweigh the swaths of people who could not tolerate such left leaning policies.    In Bernies case, that would be US voters who would go for subsidized education, maybe not free, would go for Universal Health Care, but maybe not more extensive UHC than other developed countries have etc etc

fa48cp,akparker777,Media Suppresion,Bernie is currently talking in a black church in rural NC that is known for flexing their voter suppression. I was watching a live stream on ABC11 out of Raleigh for over 40 minutes and when a question about voter suppression came out and he started to answer. The media team walked out and started complaining about facts not being right and “how long is he going to talk for?” not knowing the camera was still on.  This is the problem with the media and what we must fight against.  We will not let the media win.  We have a voice that will not be repressed and a fight we are tired of losing.

fa3gaw,xenomorph343,A text from mom,"I wanted to share with you the long text I got from my extremely Republican, Mormon mother, about how Bernie is going to “destroy our country”. Enjoy. 

“I really hope you’ve truly looked into what Bernie believes and stands for. 
He’s pretty scary in his views. 
He’s very communistic and is very much into the government controlling everything about your life. 
He’s going to raise taxes big time on everyone that makes over $29,000. 
He makes things sound good by saying he’s giving everything for free but it’s actually going to cost everyone ten times more to pull off what he wants. 
He says Cuba is amazing because everyone has to stand in line for soup. He likes that because everyone is poor and on the same level, except the leaders and government, they live highly off the people. 
The more I find out about him the more he TERRIFIES me and I really hope you’re looking into everything he believes and aren’t blindly trusting and believing what he says. He is the scariest candidate we’ve ever had and he will literally destroy our country. It blows my mind so many people fall for what he’s promising but I will respect your views. Just wondering if you’ve really looked into him or if you like his promises. Just cuz he’s promising things doesn’t mean it’s going to happen and be utopia. He’s more communist plus a radical socialist and they’re both scary and everything our country has been against since it’s history. 
Just wanted to give you something to think about, I’m definitely not trying to start a debate or upset you in any way. I know you’re super smart and will do what you think is best. Love you so much.”",8,1582763633,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fa3gaw/a_text_from_mom/,OurPresident,1

fa3e7c,CubaGang,"Bernie should apologize to the people of Cuba when he takes office and end the sanctions on Cuba, China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, DPRK, and any other country we sanction as these sanctions do nothing but harm the global poor","Cuba is not an authoritarian regime and is actually a thriving democracy that should be a model for other countries. 
Policy in Cuba is decided by deputies of the people that can be recalled at any time through a popular vote, in contrast policy in the U.S. is decided by politicians in the pockets of corporations while only a small number such as Bernard actually fight for the people. 
These deputies of the people have succeeded in implementing progressive policy including:

* Free universal healthcare that is equal in quality to the U.S. but costing the government much less and costing the people nothing
* Free college including programs for doctors that are the best in the world
* Promotion of housing for everybody to the point that anyone homeless is homeless by choice like in Switzerland and 90% home ownership 
* Promotion of gender equality which has allowed the legislative body of Cuba to be nearly 50% female
* Advocacy of literacy allowing Cuba to have a 99.8% literacy rate and a campaign that taught over 10 million from other Latin American countries to read



Sincerely, a Cuban-American Bernie supporter who has been to Cuba and has family in Cuba

f9wwu7,PurposelyLost,M4A vs Current Health Care System,"I just wanted to do some quick research on M4A by comparing current prices to prices under Bernie’s plan. Here is my findings (Research based on California “Bronze” Program for Age 21 from Covered California. This is the cheapest option in the state.)

Lets give the scenario of a healthy 21 year old:  
2 Primary Care Visits = $130  
1 Lab test = $40  
Monthly Premium = $331 x 12 Months = $3,972  
Total = $4142 (No prescriptions, no dental, no vision, no copays, etc.)

Bernie’s Plan:  
An individual, regardless of age, making $98,550 a year would be paying $3,942 a year for comprehensive health care (It would cover hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, and as well as vision and dental benefits.)  

However, under this plan, you would still pay for prescriptions, but after you spend $200, you will not be charged. Lets say an individual meets this cap. Their yearly total would be $4142. The same as California’s basic coverage for a 21 year old who has 2 Primary Care visits and 1 Lab Test with no other fees.

Approximately 70% of Americans fall in the category of making less than $100,000 a year. This means that a minimum of 70% of Americans would be paying far less than what they are paying now to receive all-inclusive care.

TL;DR – If you are a 21 year old in great health, Bernie’s plan would cost you the same as the current cheapest plan in California, but you would receive all inclusive healthcare under M4A, whereas under the current structure you best be walking around in a hazmat suit and a helmet.

f9wp7y,username_584,Last night I watched the dem debate,"Preface: bernie is the man! 

I'm a 24M from the UK and watched, for the first time last night, a US political debate. The Dem Debate.

Oh my god what a shambles. It is literally like a television drama. If I didn't already have a brief background on the candidates and debates I could have easily mistaken it for a typical US political drama. Every candidate apart from Bernie should be embarrassed by that performance. It's a complete blame game and smear fest, real issues were not tackled, only glossed over so they blow more smoke up their own asses without providing any sort of real solutions or plans of how they  achieve what they say they will. Other than Bernie they all talked a complete load of shite. How is it that in this day and age, and considering the opposition, Bernie was the only Democratic candidate on that stage that talks any sense and feels like a real leader of the people. The rest are soulless.

Anyway, thanks to the dems for an entertaining evening, I always like Bernie but now I'm sure he's the one. Good luck!",8,1582737930,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/f9wp7y/last_night_i_watched_the_dem_debate/,OurPresident,1

If no, this is even bigger money given to corporations than Trump's tax cuts. I don't think anyone here expects corporations to voluntarily increase our salary. 

If yes, this is the biggest selling point of his plan that I never heard him mention it raise. I am a union employee and if the employee contribution get added to my salary I will get a 10% raise, that would even out the tax increase. and for people with less salary, since the health care cost is the same, they are going to get a bigger rasie and fewer taxes to pay.

Here are the titles of just a few articles attacking him:

The Washington Post: We must stop Bernie Sanders, and I see no path forward but for my opponents to drop out

The Atlantic: The Price of a Sanders Nomination

National Review: Bernie Sanders, the Most Useful Idiot

National Review: The Moral Failing of Bernie Sanders

CNN: Sanders defends his past praise of Cuban social programs

New York Post: Democratic debate: Bernie Sanders won’t back down on support of Castro, Cuba

Politico: Florida Dems in uproar after Sanders’ Cuba comments

CNN: Can Bernie Sanders beat Donald Trump? Here's the reality (article claims the reality is that ""nominating a democratic socialist in a center-right country is a real risk -- and could deliver Donald Trump a second term.""

Vanity Fair: Journalists Face the Wrath of Bernie Sanders Supporters

The New York Times: Bernie Sanders Outlines Funding for His Plans, but It May Not All Add Up

The Washington Post: Bernie Sanders’s big-spending promises aren’t a sign of courage



All these articles are incresibly misleading and down right dishonest. Some of them are some of the most malicious articles I've ever seen written about Bernie Sanders. I'm honestly worried about all these attacks. We've never seen him get attacked quite like this before. I am particularly worried about the attacks claiming he praised Fidel Castro. A lot of Americans are pretty dumb when it comes to this subjec matter and I'm worried that the Castro attack might be an attack that actually does some damage.

I have a couple more! This will be the same format, so I'd love sourcing if you can provide some!

1. What exactly does ""cosmetic"" mean when we talk about what would NOT be covered? Rather, more specifically, have we be given more examples than just ""cosmetic surgery"" by Bernie or his campaign?
2. Who decides what is medically necessary? Will that be predefined by whoever is running M4A or will that be up to doctors to determine?

The exact question I got was:

""thanks for that info....1 question that I had though (and this is even a current issue) who decides if something is medically necessary or cosmetic?  Is the decided by the dr and the patient (who it should be decided by) or is it by the insurance or government who know nothing about the situation?""

f9lsfk,BigDickHit,"Senator Sanders, please own your vote","I couldn't believe when I heard you say that you thought that was a bad vote to ""protect gun manufacturers."" You know they will continue to hit you with that. Please, own the vote. Ask the people who say it's a bad thing if they think somebody who was hit by somebody in a speeding car if they believe they should be able to sue the car manufacturers. 

Please, point out that it protects American industry. Otherwise, anybody with enough money can bury small companies in enough litigation to crush the businesses because of misuses of their products. Any small business will be at the whims of anybody with enough money to pay their lawyers to continue litigation against them. 

I say this as a staunch advocate of the 2nd amendment. I say this as somebody who owns multiple firearms that could be considered ""assault rifles"" yet have never been involved in any sort of violent crime.

Support universal background checks for all firearm purchases, but allow local Sheriff's departments to conduct those FFL transfers with stipulations that the only way they can deny that FFL transfer is if the recipient is a prohibited person. Otherwise it ends up like California, where even if you are perfectly legally allowed to attain a concealed carry permit, yet certain counties will deny every application because they want to. Because police want the monopoly on force. People who want to be able to protect themselves are being told ""Sorry, all of my people carry firearms, but I do not want you to be able execute your Constitutionally guaranteed right to self defense. You had just better hope and pray we answer your 911 call in time.""

Also, if you deregulate hearing protection (i.e. gun mufflers, i.e. suppressors, or ""silencers""), which are almost never used in crimes, many, many gun owners will vote for you, both in the Democratic primary and in the presidential race.",14,1582683103,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/f9lsfk/senator_sanders_please_own_your_vote/,OurPresident,1

What she said really resonated with me. 

She said that in 2016 she felt like Bernie was just telling us to eat the rich, but in 2020 he is telling us how to cook the rich.

As the title suggests, I was wondering how Bernie proposes to pay for all the policy's he wants to put in place. Like Medicare for all and free college. I love these ideas and I want to implement them, and they sound good on paper, but when I hear the estimated 42 trillion dollar cost over 10 years that everything is proposed to cost, I get discouraged.
For example the 55% tax on 10 million dollars is estimated to be bring 1-2 trillion dollars in tax revenue, I wonder how everything else is going to be paid for.
Is be planning on cutting military funding or something else?
I'm looking for some numbers to justify this so I can get the holes filled in my mind. Please correct me if I am wrong on any of the numbers

f9fy58,holygarbanzobeans8,What do you think about the ways Bernie is represented on Late Night shows?,"Hey, first time poster here.  


I am a Turkish citizen (and a Bernie Bro!) but for almost a decade now I have been closely following United States politics and, especially, presidential elections - partially due to my profession but mostly because, you know, it is a big deal globally too. I am also a huge fan of late night shows, starting with Jon Stewart, and they are a good and quick way for me to stay up to date with current state of affairs in United States. And since the dialogues are posted on YouTube by mornings here, they are also a very entertaining way to start the day.  


Having said that, lately I realized that I was getting irritated and even take offense by some jokes made at Bernie's expense. Now I am aware that there is a clear stigmatization going on about the way some Bernie supporters behave online, and this may also mean to have a thinner skin when it comes to jokes made at the expanse of Bernie too. So I decided to chuckle some off, like the way I do with jokes about Trump. But the more I watch, the more I started to feel like there is a pattern of mainstream bias against Bernie, especially when it comes to the amount of time dedicated to Bernie jokes in a dialogue and with the content of said jokes.  


Let me add that, I am in no way generalizing here. For instance, I love Seth Meyers and his ""A Closer Look"" segment, which is by far has the best political commentary on issues right now. I was thrilled when he handled the frustration of establishment Democrat pundits on his show yesterday and that was a brilliant segment. The same could be said more or less with Trevor Noah too, because it definitely looks as if he really loves Bernie and sympathize with him. But I don't think these apply to Colbert's show, which I lately started to stop more and more often instead of watching the whole dialogue like I used to. I know Colbert is perhaps ""the"" sweetheart of liberals in United States and some might say say that he is fair to every candidate but it definitely does not seem that way to me. For instance, I am already halfway through last night's dialogue and it has so far been about cracking jokes about Bernie (with an exception of one Biden joke) in a way that distorts Bernie's overall political message. I feel like there is a clear, corporate bias informing these types of jokes and can't help but think Stephen is just another Chris Matthews or other centrist pundits, but with humor.   


I just wanted to get your opinions as Bernie fans and US citizens who have more context than I do when it comes to these subjects. Am I right to be frustrated or am I getting worked up against things that do not exist?",4,1582660138,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/f9fy58/what_do_you_think_about_the_ways_bernie_is/,OurPresident,1

f9f9iu,Fred42096,I have a question about how Bernie vs. Trump would go down in the event they compete for the presidency.,"I have a friend who, while claiming to support Bernie, thinks he has no chance to beat trump. His reasoning is as follows:

I. Trump is pulling in a far larger number of votes in the RNC

II. Most working class people, especially in energy, are enjoying good wages and job availability and (however incorrectly) associate it with trump’s administration. They are afraid of what Bernie implies for their job security. While I am sure Bernie would not disenfranchise and entire population of working people, the uneducated voters see him as a threat.


I wanted to know what this sub thinks about Bernie’s odds of winning the election are if he is nominated. I always assumed that he stood a strong chance, but now I’m afraid that Trump’s plutocracy might still win over the people despite offering nothing to them. I have a lot of emotional attachment to Bernie as a future for America and want to quantify what our force is, and what it opposes.

f9f3ki,gwchatt,Educate yourself now! A deluge of lies and misinformation is coming...,"For those who haven't seen it, Bernie released his detailed plan to pay for all his programs at CNN's Monday Town Hall in SC. That plan is detailed here:

[https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/](https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/)

For Bernie supporters, this is absolutely essential reading. As the primary advances to and through Super Tuesday, major media outlets will parrot both establishment Democrat and Trumpublican talking points as legitimate critiques of Sanders' program. Our friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, and all our other communities will hear these things, and that will be their ""public education"" on these issues. Moreover, they will bring these partisan critiques up in conversations online and in person; they will test these arguments publically, almost reflexively. Most will adopt one or more of these arguments as their own rationalized perspective on the issues. That is how mass media works.

Since media will not be ""on our side"" in the weeks to come, Sanders' supporters themselves--who are many--will need to shoulder the educational burden. We will need to learn to use our collective media power, as a truly diverse social movement, to calmly, clearly and factually refute bogus and misleading claims. \[NO fighting, please.\] And then, we will need to educate our fellow working class Americans on the real solutions Bernie can offer to improve the conditions of their lives.

Despite the need for study, this shared project should be easier than you expect. What the corporate media and political elite do not understand is that their messages are no longer coherent to a suffering working class. Their message on health care is incoherent to most Americans who use our present health care system. Our message speaks clearly to these issues. Their message on higher education is incoherent to most Americans who carry significant student loan debt. Our message speaks clearly to these issues. Their message on taxation is incoherent to middle-class Americans who pay less in taxes, but more on everything else. Our message speaks clearly to these issues.

Bernie's staff have done an excellent job on this website putting together the information and arguments we need to win the information wars in the coming media blitz. It's time for us to study up and get out there. /end rant/",3,1582656917,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/f9f3ki/educate_yourself_now_a_deluge_of_lies_and/,OurPresident,1

f9edmr,CaptMackenzieCalhoun,"The Problem of Democratic Socialism or how Bernie can bring temporary help, but fail long term.","Democratic Socialism has become a popular Socialist movement in the 21st century. While it may help us gain a fight against the propaganda war and gain to recruits to anti-capitalism ideologies, but it has some major flaws. 

The biggest flaw of Democratic Socialism is it's reliance  of liberal democracy as the tool to achieve socialism. Democratic Socialists believe that they can achieve socialism through the liberal democratic system. They believe violent revolution against the bourgeoisie is wasteful and unnecessary. The people can simply rise up via the ballot block and simply reform capitalism into Socialism without violence. It may sound nice to newcomers, but they must understand that bourgeoisie elements will resist. The capitalist class in the government will fight hard. They can revolt by putting tons of money into liberal politians to remove or kill Dem Soc reforms. They can influence the military and establish a coup.  Don't forget how easy for foreign liberal governments can send aid to the liberals in the Democratic Socialist states to crush the socialists. 

Lets take a look at states with leaders who pushed for Democratic Socialism: 

Salvador Allende (Chile) - Ended in a military coup

Hugo Chávez (Venezuela) - Coup, but restored to power.

Nicolás Maduro (Venezuela) - Survived coup

Evo Morales (Bolivia) - Ended in military coup. 

Have you noticed a pattern here? 

The flaws of Democratic Socialism: 

**Military:** 

The biggest key of Democratic Socialism's downfall was the military. They lost their power because the military wasn't there to defend the workers, but the liberals. Remember what Mao said: 

&gt;Every Communist must grasp the truth, ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."" Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party. Yet, having guns, we can create Party organizations, as witness the powerful Party organizations which the Eighth Route Army has created in northern China. We can also create cadres, create schools, create culture, create mass movements. Everything in Yenan has been created by having guns. All things grow out of the barrel of a gun. According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power. Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army. Some people ridicule us as advocates of the ""omnipotence of war"". Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist. The guns of the Russian Communist Party created socialism. We shall create a democratic republic. Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed. We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war, and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun.  PROBLEMS OF WAR AND STRATEGY https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_12.htm

If the party doesn't have control of the military or the military is part of the party. The possibility of counter revolution skyrockets. A socialist society must have defenders who protect the workers. In China, the PLA is under the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the CPC. In the USSR, the Soviet Military is run under the Minister of Defense under the  Politburo. In Cuba, the military is run by the First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party.  In Venezuela was able to survive because the military is run by members who are part of the party and remained loyal. Eventhough the military is seprate of the party in Venezuela. 

For Socialism to achieve we must have the military under the wing of the vanguard party. 

**Liberal Democracy**

Democratic Socialism requirement to use liberal democracy as the main tool is an issue because the liberals are not liquidated from power. Democratic Socialists must ally with liberals to gain modest reforms. In order to pass laws. It may have to make concessions to pay simple laws if they don't have a majority vote to override the liberals. SYRIZA is a great example of why using liberal democracy doesn't work. SYRIZA pushed to end austerity from Greece. They got into power with the mandate. When the fight came. They collapse because they didn't have the power to fight the liberal elements in Greece and the EU. Which fractured the party.  

Also Liberal Democracy is a Democracy only for liberals only. They will resist any change by Democratic Socialist elements in the liberal democracy. They can outspend and out maneuver Democratic Socialists. Like for example in Seattle: The head tax that Sawant pushed showed the limits of the use of bourgeoisie democracy. After she won the fight and passed the law. Amazon threatened to hurt Seattle hard financially. The council repealed Sawant's law. Then Amazon unleashed its fury this year to remove Sawant from office. With luck Sawant was able to survive Amazon's challenger. Don't think Amazon will not stop.  If the liberals remain. They will ALWAYS be there fighting us. China, USSR, and others has shown the only way to prevent liberals from returning is to liquidate them from power, by any means necessary. 

Also Democratic Socialism eventuality become reformist Social Democrats or become a wing of liberal parties. We are already seeing this with the DSA and their propaganda outlet the Jacobin. Democratic Socialists are now asking for Socialists to support liberal parties or even JOIN liberal parties like the Democratic Party in the US. Because they believe they can change and influence from the inside out.  This is a wrong method because this kills Socialism from moving forward. 

Socialism of the 21st Century has done a lot of good. Bolivia and Venezuela has helped the workers a lot. Yet it doesn't go far enough to help and defend the workers completely. 

Marxism-Leninism has shown the Democratic Socialism is not the way. Marxist Leninist theory has shown us that it is more survivable when surrounded by liberal states who threaten their livelihood. By keeping the military to defend the workers as part of the party and making sure there is a dictatorship of the proletariat runs the state completely.",4,1582654142,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/f9edmr/the_problem_of_democratic_socialism_or_how_bernie/,OurPresident,1

According to this plan (and assuming my math is correct), Bernie Sanders plans to raise nearly $20 trillion from taxes on corporations and the ultra-wealthy. From what I can tell, he does not make it clear how he plans to prevent these taxes from being handed down to consumers through the market (raising prices, etc.), which is what I would like to know.

Let's do some more math, again assuming my initial sum is correct. Suppose 100% of the new wealth and corporate taxes get passed to consumers. $20 trillion, distributed across 330 million people (the current population of the US), is about $61,000 per person over 10 years - $6,100 per year. That is a significant amount of money, so how does Bernie plan to keep the tax burden where it belongs?",12,1582654066,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/f9ecwn/how_does_bernie_sanders_plan_to_stop_the/,OurPresident,1

f9d7sd,BaldKnobber123,Bernie vs The Moderate Conglomerate: A Myth,"**The Myth**:

Bernie's base is a minority in the party, but incredibly loyal. This gives him a lead when the moderate votes are split, but the real will of the party is for a moderate, as they collectively poll higher than him. 

In the case of a brokered convention, if Bernie leads pledged delegates, the party should pay attention to the majority that don't want Bernie. Assuming Bernie leads with 40%, and the moderates (Biden, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Klobuchar) combine for 50%, it should be the duty of the party to realize the progressive/moderate divide, and act in favor of the majority, even if that means the leader does not become the nominee. After all, our goal is to stop Trump, and casting aside the moderates would leave us vulnerable - we should be focusing on electability. (Argument taken direct from the comment section of the NY Times)

 __

**The Truth**:

__

*The Progressive/Moderate Divide is Hazier than Presented*

The myth requires that if the moderates form behind a *single candidate*, then that candidate will beat Sanders, since *all* moderate voters will favor the moderate candidate.

To start, entrance/exit poll data from both [Iowa](https://imgur.com/zQW2MyW)/[New Hampshire](https://imgur.com/i78lF97) shows that moderates tend to do best with voters whose top priority is beating Trump, which suggests electability, rather than sheer preference, may have driven stronger progressive/moderate divides in those states. This could change as details of Sanders’ electability become more widespread.

Still, the strong progressive/moderate divide doesn't hold up to the ranked polls. [According to Morning Consult (*pre-Nevada debate and caucus*)](https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/), Sanders is:

* The top 2nd choice candidate for both Biden (9% above 3rd choice) and Warren (16% above 3rd choice) voters

* The 3rd choice for Bloomberg voters (8% behind Biden, tied with Buttigieg)

* The 4th choice for Buttigieg voters, however only 2% behind Bloomberg/Klobuchar, who are tied for second

A candidate chosen from the moderates to combat Sanders would be against all of Sanders' current support, which [538 calculates to be 11% above the next highest candidate (Bloomberg)](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/national/), in addition to all support he would pick up from the candidates that dropped.

Per Morning Consult, Sanders has the most favorability of *any* Democratic candidate. In terms of overall favorability, Sanders has 74% favorability, while Joe Biden has the second highest favorability with 66%. However, some of the moderates are less known, so they register less favorability, but more ""haven't heard of/no opinion"", leaving room for favorability growth. Taking this into account to some degree, Sanders also has the highest favorable to unfavorable ratio *of any candidate*.

Last from Morning Consult, we see Sanders maintains a large lead (16% ahead of 2nd place Bloomberg) amongst liberal voters, while being competitive with moderate and conservative voters. Sanders is only 2% behind both Biden and Bloomberg amongst moderate voters, and 10% ahead of Buttigieg. For conservative voters, Sanders is 3% behind Bloomberg and 2% behind Biden, while 13% ahead of Buttigieg.

The most recent national polls from [Emerson show Sanders in the lead](http://emersonpolling.com/category/polls/). However, they are not as strong as Morning Consult for moderate/conservative support, but they still show Bernie with major support from very/somewhat liberal voters and competitive with moderate/conservative voters.

&gt;	Sanders has a commanding lead with “very liberal” voters at 58% support, followed by Warren at 20%, and no other candidate is in double digits with those voters. Sanders holds a smaller lead among “somewhat liberal” voters with 29% support, followed by Biden at 18%, Warren at 16%, and Bloomberg at 14%. And among “moderate” or “conservative” voters, Biden leads with 30%, followed by Sanders and Bloomberg at 17%, and Buttigieg at 9%.

[In the newest CBS/YouGov poll (conducted after the Nevada debate)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2020-poll-most-voters-expect-trump-will-be-reelected-cbs-news/), when participants were told to select who they would be likely to vote for as Democratic nominee, *and were allowed to select more than one*, Sanders led all candidates with 48% likely to vote for him. Warren followed with 44%, Biden with 38%, and Buttigieg with 29%. Demonstrating more broad support for progressives over moderates when looking at all candidates a person is likely to support. According to the same poll, 76% of people believed the Democratic primary was taking the party in the right direction (which is more progressive than previous years), or in *too moderate* a direction. 54% of respondents believe Democrats should take a more progressive agenda than Obama in 2020.

Ideologically, results from a recent USA TODAY/Ipsos poll show that Sanders is seen to best share the values of those polled:

&gt;	However, the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll found 39% of adults said Sanders “shares my values,” compared to 30% each for Buttigieg and Biden, 31% for Warren, 28% for Bloomberg and 31% for Trump.

&gt;	Among those who identified as Democrats, 64% said Sanders shared their values compared to 55% for Warren, 53% for Biden, 50% for Buttigieg and 46% for Bloomberg.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/02/15/bernie-sanders-tops-other-democrats-trump-likability-ipsos-poll/4754500002/

In Nevada, the most recent and diverse state, Sanders led with almost [every demographic (Washington Post)](https://i.redd.it/q84zrp5rmji41.png). This includes making major gains amongst the moderates, [beating all but Joe Biden with moderate voters](https://imgur.com/Ddlb9Nc). 

In Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders won or kept competitive in almost all demographics, however he did lag with moderates. In Iowa, Sander was behind the three main moderate candidates, [*however* he actually won amongst non-white moderate/conservatives (albeit a small demographic in Iowa)](https://imgur.com/8ngU1Gd). In New Hampshire, Sanders [lead amongst liberals/somewhat liberals, but trailed Buttigieg/Klobuchar amongst moderates while remaining competitive with conservatives](https://imgur.com/ID4tgZx).

__

*Electability* 

To begin, the concept itself is loose, with [real concerns that we can never truly know who is electable (as if the writing off of Trump didn’t showcase this)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/youll-never-know-which-candidate-is-electable/). However, the term has dominated the electoral lexicon, and should be discussed.

In regards to beating Trump: **according to Real Clear Politics aggregate polling data, [Sanders polls best against Trump](https://imgur.com/4vElDSZ)**. All candidates beat Trump according to RCP, however, if you take [the average spread amongst the moderates it equals 2.76% above Trump, while Sanders polls 4.4% (including Warren as progressive brings average to 3.1%)](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_buttigieg-6872.html).

In Nevada, [Sanders demonstrated his unique ability to create a large multiracial, multigenerational base](https://imgur.com/dRYvSmX). Thus far, the demographics of Nevada are the best surrogate for the diversity of the United States as a whole. Sanders’ massive lead amongst Hispanics (51% relative to 2nd place Biden’s 17%) rings more important than ever in 2020, as [Hispanics are projected to be the largest minority voting group in the US this year](https://imgur.com/8z30UO8).

According to [a new poll from the UW–Madison](https://news.wisc.edu/battleground-state-poll-1/), in the notorious 2016 swing states - Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin - [Sanders leads all candidates against Trump](https://imgur.com/NHeA9sg).

Pennsylvania has been a state of particular debate, largely due to Sanders’ opposition of Fracking. This is not as clear cut as presented. Pennsylvania [actually supports a ban on fracking, with 48% for and 39% opposed](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/01/31/in-pennsylvania-poll-finds-registered-voters-split-on-whether-to-ban-fracking/), however Penn. does maintain majority support of fossil fuels. In contrast to this, polls indicate [Penn., by a fair majority, believes the state should be doing more to combat climate change and that it is currently causing problems](https://whyy.org/articles/poll-shows-pennsylvanians-concerns-about-climate-change-are-increasing/). Bernie could gain some ground here by focusing on the [aspects of the Green New Deal most persuasive to Independents and Republicans, mainly economic growth, electricity costs, new jobs, and national security](https://imgur.com/dFkfqRZ).

Beyond fracking, Pennsylvania is comprised of demographics Sanders tends to succeed with in the primary, e.g. incomes &lt;$100,000/yr and majority being without college degrees.

Perhaps the biggest change since 2016 is the youth vote:

&gt;	Pennsylvanians between the ages of 18 and 35 turned out to vote at a rate of 40 percent in 2018, nearly double that of 2014.

&gt;	**Before the midterms, people ages 34 and younger were registered to vote in greater numbers than those ages 65 and older —a first in Pennsylvania history.**

&gt;	“we found out they cared about college affordability, affordable health care, climate change, racial equity and justice”

https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2019/04/10/youth-vote-nextgen-america-pennsylvania-democrat-republican/stories/201904090167

The increased share of the electorate being youth voters is not a Pennsylvania specific trend, [but instead a trend across the entire country](https://imgur.com/N88xzNu).

This is significant given that Sanders dominates the under 38 demographic. Extending to the national level: college voters presented a choice of every Democratic candidate *and Trump* [favored Sanders with 42.3%, Trump coming second with 19.9%, and Buttigieg 3rd with 11.9%](https://www.axios.com/bernie-sanders-college-students-polling-d3423758-563a-4bd3-844d-1299296c0c84.html).

Given Sanders’ large lead amongst young voters, it is not unreasonable to believe that if anyone can drive increases in youth turn out, it is him.

*Overall*

We see clear evidence for both the electability of Sanders, and for the ambiguity around the exaggerated progressive/moderate divide.

her instant reply. “ oh he has 3 houses!” in a negative tone. this convo did not end well either, because she thinks shes going to be taxed all of her income. single parent making 60k. Now, i went back to my room and she starts texting me links. and i dont know how to reply.

f9af37,PWNath,"Have you felt attacked recently by MSNBC? Have you become tired of listening to the alleged ""liberal"" news network spouting conspiracy theories and right-wing talking points?","Well you've come to the right place! I too have become completely disenfranchised by the establishment media. As of late MSNBC has proven they are not a news network but are rather the propaganda-wing of the DNC. It's legitimately sickening to see how much effort is going into their attempts to subvert the will of minorities and the working class. 

So I got to thinking, how do we affect their viewpoints? Tweeting at them might not be so affective as they will continue to claim the only Jewish presidential candidate in the race and his supporters are Nazis (with nobody in the media calling out the blatent prejudice that goes into that statement). So do what you should be doing with our congress-people or senators... Write them! Email them! Keep it formal, air your greivences in a constructive way and make it known that their coverage of this election and their outright lies have turned you away from their platform, they have lost you as a viewer. Give examples but make it so this is in no way can be construed as some kind of an attack. Don't give them more fuel to the Bernie Bro fire but put pressure on them.

Conservatives and the wildly uninformed will not believe that we have the money to accomplish basic human rights, and they'll call themselves patriots in the same breath. Never back down on your opposition to this point, tell them to how much we're going to dump on healthcare anyway because the pharmaceutical companies are FUCKING us, and then to at how much less we could spend on the military and still be the best, bar none, because the military industrial complex is FUCKING us too, and then to how much money Americans don't have to spend on the economy because student debt is FUCKING them too, and then look at how much less the elite and their corporations pay (sometimes literally $0) than they should, and realize that pretty much everyone is FUCKING you.

Perhaps a flow chart of how *in general* the current system works, and how universal health care simplifies it?

I'm sure that there will be deep dives into my post history for the people that do that kind of thing but I just have a quick question here. Mike Bloomberg brought up Bernie Sanders' wealth in the last debate and I think he was very caught off guard.  I think for people like me who are skeptical of Bernie Sanders, we wonder why this isn't brought up more often. The guy is worth millions of dollars and owns several homes. Under a socialist economy, he would call that unfair. Yet this is the life that he chooses to live.

-Donald Trump's Twitter

A) I think he actually respects Bernie, and knows he's genuinely the populist that Trump claimed to be in '16, and Bernie's pretty squeeky clean- no obvious attacks.

B) I think that in the case, if Bernie has the most delegates but the DNC gives the nomination to someone else, we would all be furious and many of us wouldn't vote for that person, especially if it were Bloomberg or Pete. I think Trump sees that as a possibility and doesn't want to upset any Bernie Bros at this point because we could hypothetically choose to vote for Trump instead of the Dem the establishment chooses to override the people's vote. That's why he's going to keep saying the DNC is trying to rig it against Bernie, to make himself seem like an ally against the DNC. 

However if Bernie DOES secure the nomination I'm sure he would hit harder at Bernie then, because he has to, but I don't think he will be good at attacking him, even then.

I also understand taxes for individuals may increase (though this is offset somewhat by no longer having to pay healthcare premiums/etc). 

Also, whenI was in the military, my command sometimes paid 1000s of dollars for flimsy little circuit cards that cost maybe 5 cents to make and were from the 1960s.

$84,325 Head of Household

If you make less than those, you will save money. If you make more your net pay may go down, depending on your health costs.  You would also have a far easier time getting care and no insurance hassles.

That assumes your entire healthcare cost is $2639
AND also assumes that will not go up due to age/illness/pregnancy/etc.

For me, not only are my costs $15,000 a year, but I also have to spend 50-100 hours submitting reimbursements, appealing denials, dealing with multiple hospitals and billing entities.

Well, after making over 100 calls yesterday I think it's safe to say even an introvert can make them and do just fine at it. At first it was awkward and I was super nervous with the first few calls. I was fortunate to only deal with a couple of angry people, but most were either polite or extremely engaging. My favorite calls were the undecided people. I was able to convince a few to commit to voting for Bernie and the ones I couldn't thanked me for listening to them and would be considering Bernie thanks to my call.

Fellow introverts, now is the time to not be afraid. If I can do it, you can do it!

Source: https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/primaries-and-caucuses

Iowa Results:
Pete - 43,316 votes (25.04%) - 563 state delegates (26.2%) - 14 pledged delegates
Bernie - 45,896 votes (26.54%) - 563 state delegates (26.2%) - 12 pledged delegates


New Hampshire Results:
Pete - 72,474 votes (24.3%) - 9 pledged delegates
Bernie - 76,394 votes (25.6%) - 9 pledged delegates

Please help me understand how in one state, Bernie loses by two pledged delegates when they are tied in state delegates (the deciding factor) and he wins the pop vote. Meanwhile, in the next state, Bernie wins the total votes but receives the same number of pledged delegates as Pete. 


Nevada Results:
Pete - Received 13.9% of votes and 2 pledged delegates 

To my understanding, Nevada caucus rules are that a candidate must meet a 15% threshold of votes in county and statewide in order to receive pledged delegates. So I am confused.

f8u8go,Takenforganite,One thing that drives me nuts about how Bernie supporters are viewed.,"I’ve seen us compared to Trump supporters, Rabid, willing to defend Bernie against anything. That argument falls apart so quickly when you actually talk to any one of us.

We have so much history on Bernie and it’s consistent. Warren supporters defend someone who former GOP, flopping on super pacs, playing theatrics to prove her heritage, and made up a lie about Bernie and continued to draw attention to it after the debate. Pete is playing pocket pool with corporations. Biden lost his oatmeal even though we can see it oozing from his pockets. Yet their fans rabidly defend their questionable behavior, deflect the argument, or simply wont talk about it. Every other candidate is a status quo corporatist and they should start being called out as such.

If Bernie did a 180 on any of his stances and started playing dirty politics I know I would drop him. If he turns out not to be who he has shown to be for the past 40 years when he’s president, I’d stop supporting him. If there ever was a time he used his platform to attack any minority or person who does not have the power to defend themselves, he would a distant memory.

f8txqt,multigrin,Fighting Greed and Fear,"I feel fundamentally this campaign is taking on more than meets the eye. Greed, no matter what economic structure is in place, will always create division. I feel like this is us putting those driven by greed in check. 

Fear also is our enemy. So many people are afraid that they are going to loose the quality of life they think they have. Also, some people are afraid that their liberties will be taken from them.

I just don't think things are going to be as extreme as they fear. Ultimately, under Bernie Sanders, the U.S. might actually have the best government run health-care in the world. No doubt if we wanted to we could have all these programs and I bet there will still be some very wealthy people/families around and probably there's going to be more. 

Just imagine waking up, still a billionaire, and knowing deep down inside you feel pretty good about knowing that people aren't dying over the price of insulin in your country anymore because you did your share to fix that by paying taxes.

Imagine, still secure for generations to come, and knowing that those generations will have a cleaner more inhabitable planet to live on because you helped fix that by just paying taxes. You're still going to have them stocks working for you. You're still going to run that business. You won't be paying for your employees health care benefit anymore though.

I am not certain what our country is going to be like in the future with Bernie. However, I know that the United States of America can have the best social programs in the world and still be a very strong economic force. 

When Bernie gets marijuana off the schedule, we are probably well poised to supply the world with the best medical marijuana. That's gonna be something worth while.

So let's get this done! Get the word out to your uber wealthy friends that they're going to be fine with Bernie. As creative and strong as we are in the U.S. they might be even better.

The same is said for my political and religious views: like many, my yard and card are barren of any signs and stickers. Don't get me wrong, I have little issue proclaiming my support one-on-one, on social media, and at parties. 

However, I believe now is the time that I make the change and publicly advertise what I believe in. The problem is, I do not know who to get in touch with - either nationally or locally - to get this proverbial ball rolling. 

I am in the Charlotte-metro area of North Carolina (Indian Trail, specifically) and if somebody has a phone number or email I can use to talk to a local staffer, I'd greatly appreciate it.

f8q35y,freewillcreative,I was at the rally in San Antonio a few days ago... and here are my 2 cents...,"
I think we are doing a disservice by calling things free. They are not free. We are paying for a system to the tune of 3.46 trillion dollars last year. It’s insanity that USA has so many underserved. I know this because I’ve seen what church ladies can do with $300. 

I also really dislike this call to fight. You want to fight? Stop buying shit. Billionaires are rich because we buy the shit they are selling. I am complicit with making Jeff Bezos a billionaire. Take that $86, you are about to spend on your latest desire down to your local food pantry or soup kitchen and experience providing 100 people with the simplest of desires, a warm meal and companionship. Do something really revolutionary like grow a garden where that god awful St. Augustine grass used to be and deliver it with a great big, “fuck you, insufficient nutrition, not today” smile to whatever understaffed pure will dispensary of hope in a bowl that will take it. 

I want to live in a world where skills, resources and time are traded fairly with no ill effect on another. I want to live in a world where if our trade does impact people in a detrimental way that we support these people in their healing back to wholeness. I want people to be supported in pursuing their heart’s loudest call so we can give ourselves the best we have to offer as a standard. 

I was in awe of the diversity at the rally united in one room for each other. I’ve seen to much for hope but I felt the possibility of my ideals to actuate into powerful physical reality. I’m impressed with Bernie’s energy, his consistency and the time is now.
I’m not a democrat or a republican. I am a free will creative and I will stand with you.",5,1582544845,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/f8q35y/i_was_at_the_rally_in_san_antonio_a_few_days_ago/,OurPresident,1

It's not apparent I've changed his mind on anything at all, but at the end I told him I would ""be voting in (his) interest whether he likes it or not"", and I think that made him see me less as someone actively trying to ruin the country and everything it stands for, and more as someone with the best of intentions even if my options are different than his.

I'm not sure this is post worthy to be honest, but if there are others like me with family that are voting Trump and think Bernie Sanders is evil, maybe this approach would have some luck with you as well. And while I know how easy it is to just tune out and try and insulate yourself from the toxicity I'd like to encourage everyone to keep engaging the people in your life, which is quite possibly as important as any volunteering to the Sanders campaign directly.",0,1582519089,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/f8lxe1/i_just_had_the_most_productive_talk_with_my/,OurPresident,1

f8lpt8,IAmTheJudasTree,"Simple post: I live in Virginia, can I pick up a yard sign in person somewhere?","Post-Nevada I've decided to switch from supporting Warren to Sanders. I love Warren and think she'd make an amazing president, but I don't think she has any shot of winning at this point and if it can't be Warren then I'm all in for Sanders.

So.

Basic question, I want to put up a Sanders yard sign. I went to order one from the Sanders store, but shipping alone is about $10, and I'm in a tight financial situation at the moment. I live in Virginia - are there Sanders campaign offices around that I could go to in-person and pick up a yard sign? I'd be happy to pay the $3 in person that's listed as the price on the website, but I'm having a more difficult time justifying spend almost $15 on a sign+shipping at the moment.

f8l8u5,btjones2010,Medicare for all vs. Denmark’s healthcare,"Saw this on Twitter. See text below. Genuinely  Curious to see what you all think about it. 

“People who cite places like Denmark to defend Bernie’s M4A proposal are conceding they don’t know much about his healthcare plan or much about the systems in the places they are comparing with. 

To compare:

Denmark has one of the highest tax rates in the world. Average Dane pays over 45%. That’s how they afford their system. Even a similar system would mean a huge tax hike for nearly every American.

Denmark’s system is very localized. It’s managed at a regional and local level, not federal. M4A would be exact opposite. 

Denmark allows supplementary private insurance. Bernie’s M4A plan notably bans it. 

Denmark requires about 1 general practitioner per person and a certain number of hospital bed etc per person. For us to match, US would have to more than quadruple the current number of doctors while also cutting their pay significantly under M4A.

Denmark also has huge immigration restrictions and severe restrictions on access to healthcare for foreigners and illegal immigrants to limit costs. Bernie wants to do the opposite and open up government-funded healthcare for anyone who is here.

Extent of benefits offered by Medicare for all far exceeds what is offered among packages in Denmark. 

Denmark also doesn’t have record of medical innovation we have, which would be largely stagnated by price controls pushed by Bernie”",9,1582515768,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/f8l8u5/medicare_for_all_vs_denmarks_healthcare/,OurPresident,1

f8j96h,GethsemaneAgain,How Will Coronavirus Affect the Race for the Nomination?,"One thing I have seen no-one talking about, let alone anyone in the Bernie sphere, is what effect Sars-CoV-2 ""Coronavirus"" will have on the US presidential race. The country for the most part seems utterly oblivious to a global pandemic unfolding right under their noses.

[It took three days](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f8bzaq/shit_went_down_fast_coronavirus_diary_1/) for an epidemic to spread to over 100+ people infected and caused the quarantine of over 50,000 people to their towns in northern Italy. [Schools have shut down](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f8ewal/update_from_milan_italy/) and supermarkets are [emptying out](https://imgur.com/gallery/KthGJJj). Austria has [stopped all trains](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8fqic/austria_stops_all_incoming_trains_from_italy/) from Italy after 2 suspected cases of infection. Only draconian measures are stopping the spread of this virus and some countries are taking notice. Countries like South Korea are testing thousands, but the CDC has so far only tested 450. Everyone in the US is acting like nothing is happening because the media is downplaying the risk to Americans. (This is IMO but I think the long-awaited economic crash is coming soon because of Coronavirus having shut-down Chinese factories which is causing huge disruption in global supply chains. The Trump administration and the MSM do not want to start a panic for as long as possible.)

The real question here is, how will this affect the race for the nomination? Is this going to depress voter turnout to the point that other candidates could win? Will the elderly not come out to vote because they are the most at risk? How will the DNC respond? Surely primary dates are not going to be changed...right?

No one is talking about this and it's getting on my nerves. I know I'm not the only Bernie supporter who knows about this.

I think we need to get on top of this and think about first: distributing masks at Bernie Sanders rallies to protect our supporters, and also about spreading the word to stockpile at least a month's worth of canned food and water if at all possible.
