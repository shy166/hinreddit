fsnyd3,the_evil_pineapple,"Men of reddit, what would be your reason for not bringing up the fact you have a girlfriend?","This has been bugging me for almost a year now. Last summer I relocated for work about 6 hours away from my hometown. The company provided housing for me (20F) and a guy I worked with, so we lived together for four months and would also drive the 6 hours home for our days off. We also worked 10 hour days together for most of the time so needless to say we had a lot of time to get to know each other. A few of the 6 hour drives we talked the whole way, about random things and more personal things. He‚Äôs only a year older than me and we had a similar type of social circle (although not many mutual friends) so we were pretty compatible for conversation.

Now I had followed him on Instagram before we actually met, and in his tagged photos I realized he had a girlfriend. 

Over the summer I developed some fairly strong feelings for him, the strongest I‚Äôve ever felt for someone actually. I never attempted to act on them because he had a girlfriend, but it absolutely boggled me that *he never mentioned her, not even once in four months.* There were several times where it should have come up naturally because of the conversation but he didn‚Äôt say anything. 

I admit I think about it more than I should but it‚Äôs absolutely perplexing to me that he never said anything. 

So my question is:

Is there a reason you wouldn‚Äôt want someone to know you have a girlfriend or is it easy to just not bring it up?",41,1585697394,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fsnyd3/men_of_reddit_what_would_be_your_reason_for_not/,AskMen,2

fsiu26,Cuntcept,Do men somehow lose interest in female friends who are in relationships (even if the friendship was always platonic)? Why?,"I've had a few friendships with guys develop in the last few months and I can't help but notice that these friendships faded some time after I mentioned having a boyfriend. 

Now, these friendships were always platonic from the start (at least to me). And I never noticed anything sexual/romantic hints from these men either. Yet, somehow, it feels like they lost interest in this friendship when they realised I'm not single. I do have a few other close male friends and everything seems fine with them, so I'm assuming I'm not driving them away. And this was not something I experienced back when I was single. In general, it just feels like men are uncomfortable around me once they find out that I have a boyfriend. 

Do men somehow feel like they're crossing someone else's territory, or worried about your female friend's jealous boyfriend? I just can't seem to wrap my head around it and it's made it difficult for me to maintain friendships with men.",1253,1585680972,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fsiu26/do_men_somehow_lose_interest_in_female_friends/,AskMen,10

fsiglp,Yucares,How often do you have a crush on a movie character and how strong is it?,"I don't know if this is normal but I'm 21 and recently, I can't watch anything without falling for some fictional character or the actor who plays them. I know men often talk about how sexy someone is in a show/movie but I don't know what they actually feel so I want to ask. I'm gay but I want to know both perspectives.

 Do you ever feel like you don't even wanna watch it because you're afraid something will happen to that character?

E.g. I started watching Stranger Things yesterday (already binge-watched Season 1) and literally after the first few minutes, I already had a crush on Hopper. SPOILER(season 4)-&gt;&gt;!Even though I saw the trailer before I even started watching it and I knew he made it to season 4!&lt;, I was still nervous watching season 1 because I didn't want anything to happen to him. Now I really want to watch season 2 but I just don't want to go through this stress again because every time he appears on the screen, I feel distressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal? Do you ever feel anything like that towards a fictional character? Do you know how to stop this? I really don't want to feel this way, last time I had a crush on Mousesack, it took like 3 months to get over it. I don't think 3 months is normal considering I binge-watched The Witcher as soon as it came out. I just want to enjoy movies like everyone does but, to be honest, I've had this problem since I was born, it just wasn't so strong when I was little because I didn't watch stuff where people died and I didn't really love them, I just had favourite characters.

I have a question about folding your dick.

Background : When I get hard and am wearing underwear, I usually sort of tuck the old boy down so that there's a right-angle bend halfway down, with the head pointing down. So basically my girlfriend saw this and thought it looked super funny, presumably because of the right ange bend, and I am now wondering if this is something my fellow gentlemen do when they're pitching the tent, or if there is some other comfortable position that could be recommended. Personally I have never had anything to complain about with this folding arrangement, but I am always open to new ideas for comfortable ways to deal with such issues.",21,1585676501,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fsheg9/how_do_you_fold_it_up/,AskMen,0

fscrep,thooht_,What to do / deal with rejection (i suppose),"First of, maybe should've posted this in the women section now thinking about it. 

TL;DR: Good friend, female one, basicly used my friendship and my feelings. Lied to me, broke bunch of promises. Got a boyfriend, lied to me about it, even though she knew I loved her. Now our friendship is over. Am I wrong to be mad at her? Yet I am mad at myself. (Hopefully this tl;dr is fitting lol)

Gonna try to keep this as short as possible. 

So i've been friends with this girl for 8 months, been talking daily. Talking on phone several times a week and so on. And slowly growing feelings for her. I finally told her back in november that I got feelings for her, and I told her in january for the first time that I love her. Out of accident, but still felt right. 
During these 8 months she's been chasing other guys, everyime she'd basicly dissapeared from me and come back once she got rejected or similar. She even got forced by a other guy to choose between us once and chose him. Yet I still was there for her when she came back. She been hurting my feelings, asking for forgiveness so many times I've lost count. 

She's been frequently doing same misstakes over and over. She said she loved me (as a friend, and I was ok with that.), that I mean almost everything to her and one of her best and closest friends. I've been the only one who's been there for her during so much these 8 months. 
Between just being there to talk to or helping her with her economy. (I helped pay a new computer for her cause she was silly enough and buy one she cant afford. But she paid back.) All her other friends have left her, all other guys she had in her life has left. But I've always been the one to stand by her side.

And all I ever asked back was to be able to have my friend, to her respect me and my feelings, to actually be able to exist for her and not be some kind of backup. And to always tell the truth no matter how much it would hurt me (I prefer being hurt by the truth then by the lies). But last month, or weeks, I've had this feeling she had hiding something from me. And a couple of days I got the truth. She now has a boyfriend and been lying to me for a time now about that and other things. 
She's been saying the usual stuff ""You're to good for me, I don't deserve you. "" And so on. 

The result of all this is that we had a fight (which was silly really. Should just been a good friend about it). And now all contact and friendship is over. 

**Conclusion**: But my questions is, how should I move on? And is it ok for me to feel like an asshole after all? I both feel like that, but also feel like. I've spent so much time, effort and such on us, her, everything. And in return I basicly got nothing. I got my heart broken, I got lied to. I am both sad and angry, angry that I was stupid enough to let it go so far and believe her. But also angry on myself for reacting like this.

Sorry boys for massive text. Was hoping to keep it short.

fsb7zg,Silly-Employment,I have no friends and no idea how to make my life more interesting.,"Some info first to get the gist of it:

 \- I'm a 27 european dude. 

\- Childhood has been fairly uneventful, while I never had friends or girlfriends I had no ennemies or bullies either.

\- I have a licence in sales/business but I hate that sector and don't want to get back into it, I got suicidal while I worked it.

\- I started but didn't finish a medical school due to depression, basically I have now a licence in what I don't like and nothing else.

\- I will go through the selection process to join the police at the end of the year. I almost got a temp job to fill the months but coronavirus rendered that point moot. 

\- I've been in therapy for depression and still am. 

\- My hobbies are mostly solitary, writing/reading/videogames.

\- I'm fit, it's a lone village with more cows than inhabitants so I can run outside without meeting anyone. 

Thing is, I'm awfully bored most of the time. I struggle to focus on my writing and my days feel hollow even when I do what I have planned. 

It feels like I never lived and have no clue how it is to live, I feel like a ghost. 

I tried to socialize and make friends and more, but my attempts failed and I don't want to get back into it, I'm a loner and I'm not good with handling people. If your advice are about being social or something similar, I'm so far behind others my age socially that I don't have the will to try to better it.

So yeah, I'm frustrated and lost and would greatly appreciate advice, I will answer any questions you have for me.

Im a sophomore in college at this point in my life all I want to do is get girls and just have a good time with my friends. I really just think it‚Äôs awesome to feel and be youthful, and get to experience all this shit. I like how I get a pass and it‚Äôs kind of accepted, and it seems like once you turn a certain age then it starts becoming sad. For example, just drinking and smoking, and just doing dumb shit is something that you can ‚Äúget away with‚Äù when you‚Äôre young. And like there‚Äôs probably not going to be a time when everybody‚Äôs old and hitting on girls and that type of stuff is going to not exist. I want to be able to look back at my life and say I lived it to the fullest and it‚Äôs hard for me to even think 3-5 years down the road when maybe other things will be important. 

There‚Äôs so many things I want to do and sometimes I put school and other things on the back burner when I shouldn‚Äôt. I just think I‚Äôm in the ‚Äúprime‚Äù of my life and I better start creating experiences and memories bc we‚Äôre all gonna die soon.

A problem I am facing because of that is that I don't want to masturbate because emotionally it feels like I would be forcing myself to do that but I have been having more and more wet dreams which annoy me a lot and I feel like that's happening because I don't get a release by masturbating as I used to do.

I get raising taxes on those who make money to help those who are poor bla bla bla, but Im so jaded on Govt mismanaging money and really all I care about it bring more money home to my family so we can be more comfortable.

Im also far less willing to join the latest and greatest social movements too. My generation was all about Gay rights but I just cant put myself behind trannies in the same way I did.

This has never happened to me with any other girl. I normally last a pretty long time, sometimes I don't even c\*m at all. Although I do think I've experienced love for the first time with my current girlfriend, maybe that could be why. But... I also just switched medications (lexapro to Mirtazapine) and I'm fairly certain that I'm experiencing withdrawals from lexapro.. so maybe that's also why.

fs8wm7,azt5,Do you notice that all girl‚Äôs skin taste different?,"
For context: I‚Äôll start by saying that I‚Äôve kissed at least 50 girls in my life. Not trying to show off, but instead sharing the sample size.

Throughout my life, I‚Äôve been obsessed with kissing. There‚Äôs something about it that‚Äôs so hot to me and it‚Äôs even hotter when it‚Äôs an intense make-out session. The times I‚Äôve found it most enjoyable is when I really like the smell/taste of the other person‚Äôs skin. Everyone‚Äôs skin has a different taste to them, some good and some ehh. I‚Äôve noticed that the girls who‚Äôs ‚Äútaste‚Äù I don‚Äôt like, I usually don‚Äôt like the taste when going down on them either. Not sure if this is just in my own head, or if there‚Äôs a correlation there. That‚Äôs a topic for another post, I guess. 

I‚Äôm not sure if something is wrong with me for thinking this way, but I‚Äôm extremely unattracted to some girls because of how their skin taste when kissing them and extremely attracted to others for liking their taste. I have a feeling the word ‚Äúpheromones‚Äù is about to get tossed around. 

I‚Äôd like to know if anyone else is like this, and if it‚Äôs harsh to not be interested in a girl anymore because of how her skin/lips taste. I‚Äôm also curious if anyone has stayed with a person who‚Äôs taste they didn‚Äôt enjoy at first, and ended up liking it later on?",1,1585641485,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fs8wm7/do_you_notice_that_all_girls_skin_taste_different/,AskMen,1

# 

üì∑

Ever since I was young and realized my dick had other functions apart from peeing, I always went for girls that had a devil-may-care attitude, nose piercings, hi-top Vans and an affinity with 2000's pop punk. A lot of them also tend to be fairly emasculated and smart-assed in terms of their behavior and mannerisms, not what you'd generally expect form a more girly type (think Maeve Wiley from ""Sex Education"" or Ellie from ""About A Boy""). Why is it that I tend to gravitate towards them as opposed to ""normal"" girls? Is it to do with my music tastes? Is it to do with who I am as a person?

I consider myself pretty smart and I take all preap/ap classes at school so my mom has high expectations for me. She wants me to go to college and get a nice job with a big company but honestly I don‚Äôt want to spend 4+ years to get a degree just so I can slave away my life in a cushy office desk working for the big corporate guys. I‚Äôm researching some trades and I think I would enjoy working for myself and eventually owning my own business.

-I‚Äôve heard that most trades don‚Äôt pay well. I don‚Äôt need a 6 figure salary or anything but I do want to live pretty comfortably middle class.

-I feel like I might be underutilizing my potential, do people typically go into trades because they have no other option or can‚Äôt get an education?

I wrote several paragraphs in my original writeup but I figured I'd keep this one simple.  

It's been a while since my last relationship, I watched a lot of porn, and now I'm struggling to get fully erect when my new partner and I fool around (we haven't had sex yet). When I watch porn everything's normal but when we're playing around together at best I can pull a semi. 

I'm trying not to stress about this but obviously anxiety is starting to kick in. 

Before we do the deed I'm looking for advice on steps I can take to recover. Or perhaps this is something I need to talk to my doctor about?

fs6dbl,Alphaboy666,What do you guys think of my list if boundaries for maintaining a friendship with an ex?,"Basically I've turned my own awful situation into abit of an experiment. I've recently found out I may still have feelings for a close female friend who I used to date. Usually in this situation I'd cut contact completely. However instead I wrote myself out a list of personal boundaries that I designed to help avoid developing of feeding any romantic feelings I may have/had for her, while still maintaining a fulfilling platonic friendship. 

The list goes.

No physical contact unless it's a hug to offer comfort.

No mention of mine or her love lives. If she brings it up change the subject ASAP. 

Being conscious of how much I go out my way for her. Only do what you would do for any other friend.

Avoid her on social media unless it's to quickly reply or send messages.

Be aware of how often I initiate conversation. If I find myself initiating too much. Cut contact.

Most importantly. And I can't stress this enough. If I  start to feel anything for her that's not platonic. I Take a step back immediately. 

I know it may be abit if a dramatic step. But for me at least it I think its a good thing to do. It also makes me feel like I've taken back some power that I felt I lost when she decided we were better off as friends. 

What do you guys think.? I'm open to more suggestions. All answers are appreciated.",0,1585628886,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fs6dbl/what_do_you_guys_think_of_my_list_if_boundaries/,AskMen,1

fs5o1l,ocolatechay_ussypay,How do you feel about knee or thigh high socks on a lady during sex to hide ugly feet?,"I (25F) have size 10 wide feet with very little arch (flat footed). I can never buy shoes online because they never fit right, but that's another discussion. They also sweat alot (my hands/palms too unfortunately)...always moist/clammy. I make sure to wash my feet well so they don't smell too bad, and I have to wear socks with all types of closed toe shoes (including flats and wedged heels) otherwise my shoes and feet smell rank when I take them off. My big toe is so wide/big. Carbon copy of my dad's feet. I lucked out lol. I'm super self conscious about them, and I always wear socks around people I don't know that well.

I keep my socks on when intimate with a new guy. I make sure to shower beforehand and pick out some cute knee high or thigh high socks to hide my feet. In this case, the guy has kept his socks on too. I don't know if I am being weird or not by doing this.

Am I over reacting? How do you feel about knee or thigh high socks during sex? Has the size of her feet, shape/length of her toes, or smell of them ever turned you off when intimate?

On my way home she texted me ""wow you really like me"" and I said ""yeah you're really cool"" and now we're here. She's fine but I literally only want to have sex with her. She's a couple years older than me and that's fine with me but I think she wants me to be her actual boyfriend and be like a step dad to her kid but I literally only want to fuck.

fs3u3v,thunderfart_99,What experiences have you had dating women from tight knit families?,"The wonderful girl I'm currently dating comes from a very tight knit family. Apart from one of her cousins on her dad's side moving to France and one of her aunts and uncles living on her mum's side living in the north-west of England, all of her family lives in the same town (north of England), so they meet up with each other pretty regularly. 

I've met her extended family on both her mum and dad's side, which is much bigger than my extended family. Don't get me wrong they're absolutely wonderful, and the time I did meet them all I made a massive effort to speak to them all. As a result, they treat me like I'm one of the family, not just the boyfriend of their daughter/sister/cousin/niece. My girlfriend's mother told me that they really like me, and I get on very well with her two older brothers. 

My family in comparison are very loving too, but they're more reserved I think generally. I have moved back in to my parents' home temporarily whilst I save enough money to move out, and I only see my grandparents 1-2 times every 2 months, both sets don't live in the same town as me and my parents. I only see my aunt, uncle and teenage cousins once a year, and that's always at Christmas at my granny's house - which is probably the only 'big' family gathering. We used to meet up more when I was a kid, but now I think we mostly do our own thing. Plus my aunt &amp; uncle are very religious (my family aren't), so its quite hard to relate to them. I think generally my family act individually rather than collectively.

My girlfriend also thought it was pretty unusual for me to go and see my mum and dad only once a month when I was away at university, when I lived 30 minutes away from my hometown. I think my natural programming is to stand on your own two feet, but if you need help family will be there for you.

Again, I have no problem with my girlfriend's tight knit family at all, and I genuinely enjoy being around them. It still feels a bit weird for me though adjusting to a tight knit family dynamic. Likewise I think my girlfriend finds it a bit odd that I'm just not that close with my family, and she doesn't see my family as much as I see hers, which I have no objections to. I was just wondering if any of you guys had any similar experiences, of dating anybody from a close knit family?",4,1585618522,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fs3u3v/what_experiences_have_you_had_dating_women_from/,AskMen,1

fs3o6m,Asdkahd04,"Introverted Men who needs time to recharge from socializing, what do you want your gf to do/act?","Sorry not sure if I worded the title very well. I have an introverted bf who lives in a different country than me. We generally talk a lot but lately he hasn't been online as much and replying later. 

After like a day and a half, he messaged me the other day saying that he's sorry for not replying and was just not feeling up to socializing.  He apologized for being silent and he really just went online to let me know he's okay and not ghosting me. I completely understand though! And just gave him his space and all. It's been around two days since and I think he's still recharging.

I don't really have a problem with it, but I was thinking of leaving him a message like just to check up on him or let him know that he can take as much time needed. Though, I'm not sure if he would like it cus he DID say he needed an alone time and idk if leaving messages (even if I dont expect him to reply) would count as not respecting his space.

So I wanted to know what other guys would think? Would you appreciate it when your gf/partner messagse you even when you asked to be alone or would it just annoy you? Thanks :D",2,1585617894,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fs3o6m/introverted_men_who_needs_time_to_recharge_from/,AskMen,1

How can I improve my chances at getting a boyfriend?,"For some reason the guys I've been getting to know whether in person, or  through online dating mainly just want to fuck me and nothing else.  I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm shooting too high and the guy thinks I'm below him league-wise and just wants to use me for sex or maybe it's my personality?

 I'm asking for advice on how to figure what the issue is. If you're curious what I look like, look at my post history and maybe that'll give an indication on what I need to work on. However, I am told that I'm intelligent, kind and compassionate but the guys I see just want to pump and dump me. How can I become more self-aware as a woman on how I'm coming across to guys and prevent getting played all the time? I just want a loving relationship. The guys I usually go for are somewhat attractive or just a attractive enough that I could see myself sexually with him. Although it's mainly a guy's intelligence that draws me in and makes me want to get to know them more because that's how I emotionally connect to a romantic partner.

I know this is probably a frequent question and I know everyone is bored but maybe we can have a brainstorm sesh.

As stated, my boyfriend is currently out of work and stuck at home. His company went under before this quarantine and he was already feeling down about being out of work, now all applications have really dried up. We‚Äôre in Canada so monetarily we‚Äôll be fine, I just see it making him more bored and feelin not so hot about himself.

We‚Äôve started a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù system when you have to earn 5 points to start drinking (his great idea!). So he usually takes the dog on a walk, does dishes, cleans up, works out, etc., but he‚Äôs done with that by 4 pm. I work online early mornings and usually nap after until early afternoon.

I have tons of sewing and craft projects so I‚Äôm feeling pretty content, but I wish there were more things we could do together to keep him occupied.

Sex is an obvious answer and we‚Äôve been having fun but he‚Äôs sitting watching YouTube looking so depressed and I‚Äôm out of ideas for shit to do.

He‚Äôs a gamer and I‚Äôve been playing hearthstone with him, but I can‚Äôt keep up with COD or any console games.

So those of you living with a partner, anything they‚Äôve done to make your days at home better? Or anything you wish they‚Äôd do?

frviik,throwws31,How can I deal with my friend being annoying?,"A frequent occurrence with a close friend of mine is that he says something and if you respond he retaliates by saying ""why are you getting defensive"" or ""chill out"" ""why are you mad over it"" and honestly it's became annoying as fuck.

You literally can not respond to whatever he says when he does this without him returning a comment like the ones above and it's just infuriating. I can never respond without being told I'm acting defensively or getting annoyed, no matter what I say.

An example that happened to make me post this was he randomly said (in discord with me and a friend) ""60% off is motivational monday"" and I said ""huh?"" he followed with ""i'm speaking english what don't you get"" and i said ""i don't understand what you said"" he said ""it makes sense"" so I asked the other dude if he knows what he means as I might've just misheard and he said nah and laughed so I said ""is there any context behind it, I don't get it (laugh)"" and he said he was just reading part of his email out loud and said for me to chill out, there's no need to get mad over nothing. But I was literally just responding to what he was saying?? That genuinely makes me pissed, nothing prior to it.

There's also times where he will say something that's wrong and try to act as if he's right and if myself or anyone even tries to say what is infact true, he starts saying that you're getting defensive and why are you getting mad over nothing. I can't win. I can't respond without it being twisted on to saying I'm being defensive over something. He can go on and on saying how he's right about something when you can provide physical evidence he's wrong but if you even attempt to point out he's not right, you get attacked and told you're too defensive and need to chill out

I know this is so trivial and small but it's just demeaning as fuck and my options are that I can either respond to what he says and be told I'm getting defensive or need to chill out or I just have to ignore him everytime I think he's going to pull this shit

I‚Äôve had plenty of conversations with him about this issue. He says that he doesn‚Äôt get as horny anymore and he doesn‚Äôt know why. I don‚Äôt expect him to be in the mood all the time, but we went from having sex 2-3 times a week to once or twice every 2-3 weeks with nothing else in between.

frrdwv,Valuable_Horse_,What does it mean when a guy needs space?,"**Long version:** A week and a half ago my boyfriend of 3 years flew to his childhood home to be with family during the pandemic. His return flight got pushed to two weeks out, so I was worried it would get canceled and he wouldn't be able to make it back for a few months. I asked him to take an earlier flight which led to an argument. I was upset and in the heat of the moment I said I wasn't sure about having a long distance relationship, he said he absolutely wanted to be with me no matter what, so I should take some time to think about it. A few hours later, I cooled off and went to FaceTime him to tell him I'm sorry and I want to be with him, and he responded by saying:

""I don't want to FaceTime tonight - I need space. To be clear, I do not have any negative feelings towards you. I just need space and am not sure when I'll be ready to talk, but will call you when I'm ready."" 

I tried to contact him (I regret doing this) and asked him to just work through this with me, but the next day he blocked me. I haven't heard from him for about a week and I'm worried I won't ever hear back. He's supposed to fly up in 4 days, so I'm hoping I'll hear from him before then.

**TLDR;** My boyfriend of 3 years flew home and said he needed space, I tried to contact him, he blocked me and I haven't heard from him in a week.

frr884,momma052417,How can I improve?,"Hey fellas,
So I've (24f) got a question about my bf (25m), and trying to figure out some of his behavior, since he likes to answer ""I don't know"" to just about all of my questions. 
Back story, I'm Catholic and he's converting to my Faith so we can raise our kids together with the same mindset. I try to act in a manner that gives him security in our relationship, and usually he does the same. We don't flirt with other people, we gave each other access to our social media, basically reassuring the other by our actions and words that we are completely loyal to one another. It's awesome.
That being said, sometimes we'll say things to each other that can be.....derogatory, usually in a joke. It's not intentional, I think, but it makes me wonder if we're sending mixed messages.
For example, at my mom's house, he wanted to show me something while I was tutoring my little sister. When I asked him about it (as I was standing up to follow him) he got a little irritated with me, patted his knees like he was calling a dog, pointed to the room he wanted me to enter and said, ""Get your butt in there now like I told you.""
Oof.
This isn't normally him, and instead of talking back I just sat back down while my mother corrected his statement. My bf did walk back to me, take my hands, and led me like a gentleman to the room he wanted me in, but I still felt pretty humiliated. 
So the question is this: did we handle this ok, or are there any tips you can offer so we can avoid these weird moments? We're trying to learn each other and I get there will be hiccups, but he is head of my home, and I am his lady. We don't just want it to be a performance, we want it like that behind closed doors too.",0,1585576542,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/frr884/how_can_i_improve/,AskMen,1

I am a 21 year old student from Norway who cannot seem to devote his life to anything. I really want to change that, but here is some backstory first.

Originally my family moved to Norway when I was around 15 years old. At that time we lived in a small cold village where I was suffocating badly. Only thoughts I remember I had were negative and how I wanted to get out of the predicament I found myself in. I spent my days going to school and playing video games on my freetime, its was some sort of escape from reality.

After a few years, when I was around 16-17, I decided to move to a city 300km away and attend high school there. To survive I had to get a part time job so I could pay my phone, dormitory and other bills I had at the time. While everyone else at my school were figuring out type of stuff they liked, their interests and so on - I was working different part time jobs so I could survive economically. Skip a few years and I am done with high school. I finished high school with decent grades and managed to get in to a university to study business. I decided to study business since it was the only thing that I actually did good at in school and I thought it would be useful in the future, no matter where I end up.

I studied economics for a year and realised that it wasn‚Äôt for me at all. I was once again suffocating and hating every minute of it. I figured that I should do something more positive for the world and the future generations and chose to study human development studies since there was nothing else I could see myself doing. I started studying after the summer and now I am finding myself in the same predicament I found myself in a year ago - for some reason i cannot see myself having the profession I am m studying for at the moment.¬†

I guess I had more time than before to get to know myself now and I am learning that I am more creative than I actually thought I was. I think this is the main reason I am getting confused over my study choices.¬†

So now I am struggling to find something to do with my life , I kind of feel like I have should of figured it out already few years ago. Jumping from study to study doesn‚Äôt feel like the right thing to do, so I am kind of lost now.¬†

frnma5,hiraes,Where‚Äôs the line between being a ‚Äúnaggy‚Äù woman or a man refusing to communicate and compromise?,"Tl,dr: at the end. The in between is kinda a rant you can ignore.

We all hear constantly men complaining about naggy/needy woman. But how would you describe one?

This is specifically a problem with my (F26) brother (M 24) All I‚Äôm asking him for is to respect my sleep schedule (as I need to wake up to walk the puppy we both agreed to get, but that he doesn‚Äôt help with besides walking her at night ). But he stays awake at night playing videogames and loudly talking. I‚Äôm a light sleeper and can‚Äôt wear earplugs because the puppy sleeps in my room and sometimes she throws up so I need to hear if that happens.

When I try to bring up that subject, that he wakes me up and he should be quieter, he gets mad. Every time I have a complain, he gets mad because I‚Äôm always complaining. Today I brought it up and same result, he refuses to listen because I should wake up with a smile on my face and not with ‚Äúdrama‚Äù (I should say that the last three weeks of quarantine I‚Äôve been the only one making delicious breakfasts and always waking up with a smile, so this in an exception).


Tl,dr: brother not helping at home, staying late loudly playing videogames. That‚Äôs his valid choice I respect it, but he wakes me up when I‚Äôm the one that is in charge of waking the dog and other self inflicted duties. He says I always complain and refuses to listen to me.

Now I know these posts always look biased for obvious reasons, so Im not looking for validation, I want to objectively know what‚Äôs the line between being naggy/ always complaining or just the other person refusing to communicate.

Also, what‚Äôs the better way to approach someone with this attitude when you want to talk things out? Maybe it‚Äôs a problem of the tone I‚Äôm using? I admit I‚Äôm cranky in the mornings if I haven‚Äôt slept well.

frndw9,arsalanjmusic,I'm stuck in a relationship with a suicidal partner and IDK how to get out! Looking for advice.,"Okay, so,  I met this girl in June last year, during my final A level exams. Let's call her W. W is the second cousin of one of my best friends, and we hit it off. Now my buddy warned me that she and I would probably not work out, but me being the dumb-ass that I can be, went after her, and eventually we started dating. At first it was amazing and everything was going great. We clicked like we were meant to be, amazing moments of intimacy, smoking up and having great sex, you name it. And then she got caught (We live in Pakistan, where most parents are extremely controlling and the vast majority of children/teens are raised in such a way that they're financially dependent on their parents until after they graduate from Uni). Her father read her diary and put her on total lock-down. We went from meeting multiple days in the week, to hardly once a month. And soon, the problems in our relationship started. I was already in therapy, working through my anxiety and PTSD, while she was doing the same. We'd spend all day talking on video chat, making our mental health worse by being way too open about what we'd been through in our lives and we'd trigger each other unknowingly, bringing each other down. She used to self harm and wanted to commit suicide multiple times, but I'd always talk her out of it. This was at a time when my mental state was shit and it was taxing on me to do so, and finally, after I hurt myself after trying to help her through a break down, I decided to end things as I'd never done such a thing to myself and it was evident that our relationship was no longer what it once was. It was December by now and the break up was messy. We started talking to each other again 3 days after it (unhealthy to do but we were so emotionally attached it just happened). This time i limited the time we'd talk to around an hour a day, and everything in my life improved. My mental health, my physical fitness, I even won the biggest singing competition in the country and applied to Universities in Canada. It was evident that i was doing much better. But then we started talking more again. She was my favorite person and didn't want to imagine my life without her. Though I was hooking up with other girls, it didn't matter or help me move on because of how attached we were. Then with this quarantine situation, things took a turn for the worse. Yesterday I was out w my friend (same one who's her cousin) scoring some hash and she messages me that she's going to commit suicide. After 5 hours on call, serious efforts despite the fact she'd cut her arm vertically and horizontally, we got her to stop, we got her to stop. Now I've been raped in my life more than once, dealt with it, been bullied for 3 years because I sang, made it past that, and even made it beyond being suicidal and dealing with it in therapy. But yesterday, I broke down so many times, had multiple panic attacks after months of doing great, that I can genuinely say that W trying to kill herself while on call was the worst shit I've ever gone through. I want this misery to stop, please someone give me some advice here, I don't know what to do anymore.

frn5yv,gmakbb,Would one semi bad sexual experience be enough to put you off a girl?,"So recently I (25f) had sex with this guy (28m) who I like and have been on a few dates with. So we get down to it, he‚Äôs very affectionate and it‚Äôs all going well at the start but for some reason I struggled to stay wet. This is never normally the case for me but I think maybe I was nervous because it was the first time with him and I think I was also dehydrated so I ended up getting sore really quick. We tried 2 positions and I was still sore, so I asked if we could just stop. Neither of us finished and I think I probably blueballed him really bad, which I apologised for. He assured me it was okay and we had lots of cuddles and kisses afterwards but I still feel super bad and a bit embarrassed that it didn‚Äôt go how I wanted it to. 

I just really hope he doesn‚Äôt base my sexual abilities off of that one experience or think that we don‚Äôt have good sexual compatibility. I know I‚Äôm good at sex and it‚Äôs never normally like that for me. 

Everything else up until then was going perfectly! We get along really well, we make each other laugh.

frmyoz,Badummtisss,Balls hurting - what gives?,"Okay so I‚Äôm not really looking for medical advice. About four days ago I did some body weight workout at home, had some sexy time with my wife at night. Next morning I felt some a pulse of pain in my right testicle so I thought maybe I was sleeping wrong, I adjusted my junk went back to sleep. It happened again a few minutes later. I immediately got up and tried to walk to it off. No severe pain. 

Throughout the day I felt slightly dull pain in my right ball. I thought maybe it was torsion but for some reason it wasn‚Äôt hurting when I inspected it with my fingers. No swelling no fever. I got in touch with a urologist who advised me to get on a antibiotic course for three days. Since I can‚Äôt really go out due to a lockdown for an ultrasound but give my symptoms he didn‚Äôt think it was too serious. 

I went to bed that night when I woke up next morning - my right testicle felt completely file but now I had similar dull pain in my left one. And it‚Äôs been there for three days now. I‚Äôm done with my antibiotics as well. 

When I‚Äôm walking around or laying around it‚Äôs almost zero. But when I‚Äôm sitting I can feel the dull ache. When lying down the pain sort of shifts to my lower left abdomen. If I push with my fingers on the lower abdomen right above the pelvic bone, there is some discomfort. 

Before all this started I was taking some diluted apple cider vinegar too stopped after the pain started. Not sure if it‚Äôs related. 

Anyway hoping to hear any ideas what could be it until I can get to a doctor.  

Thanks guys 

TLDR - right testicle pain shift to left testicle. Dull ache. Not going away. Slight discomfort in abdomen too.",4,1585556693,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/frmyoz/balls_hurting_what_gives/,AskMen,1

frm90t,Lower_Bodybuilder,might be falling for a close friend,"using a throwaway for privacy. so a few months ago, i met a girl in class (university) and found her attractive. we talked for a couple days and i was planning on asking her out, but she caught on to my advances and told me she has a boyfriend (with some very vague indications she was not happy with him). so at this point i was like ok no problem, it was just a basic attraction so i can be friends with this girl. we both really enjoy being around each other and are basically the same person personality-wise (other than me having more confidence). weve gotten so close over the past few months very gradually at first but now we see each other at least 3 times a week. i make her laugh so hard she almost pees herself, and she comes over often to drink and just listen to music and talk (its been strictly platonic other than flirty shoulder punches and shit like that). i know the first thought is gonna be ‚Äúif shes comfortable doing this to him then she‚Äôll do it to you too‚Äù but clearly if she wasnt loyal she would have made a move by now or taken me up on my date in the first place. i get the feeling that shes into me, but the problem is shes very insecure and has opened up about it to me before. she is not at all happy in her current relationship which has been deteriorating even longer than i‚Äôve known her. she is scared to leave him because she thinks no one will date her, legitimately, she has explained its not fishing for compliments either. her bf is a complete fuckup just from hearing her complaints about him, but he has her manipulated via guilt to stay in the relationship. he tells her ‚Äúyoure gonna have to break up with me because i love you more than you love me‚Äù.

so anyways i had been holding my tongue as i kept developing stronger feelings, and i am definitely no homewrecker. but as a very empathetic person hearing this got me to tell her that i would date her if she was single, because as someone who used to be very insecure she deserved to know that. she seemed really surprised at first and then smiled and said i‚Äôll definitely keep that in mind. and this was earlier this week. she regularly talks about her bf in a negative way and is in a long distance relationship with him. as long as ive known her she has gone to see him twice and he has never bothered to come up and see her. as i mentioned before she is VERY shy so i dont think she would outright say she has feelings for me especially in a relationship, but i am confident there is definitely at least some interest. i‚Äôm not here to play the waiting game i just genuinely love spending time with her and have gained some mutual friends out of knowing her as well. that being said, i‚Äôm starting to fall for her pretty hard. this doesnt take away from the times we hangout and how much fun we have, but its been starting to be on my mind more recently. as of now, my feelings arent strong enough to justify cutting her out, but the hourglass has definitely started. not so much looking for advice as i am insight. what would you do in my situation?


TLDR: was attracted to a girl in an unfulfilling long distance relationship. thought i could keep it platonic but am starting to catch feelings. almost certain she is into me as well, but is very insecure about leaving her bf. told her i would date her recently to see if the dynamic changes in the coming weeks",0,1585552713,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/frm90t/might_be_falling_for_a_close_friend/,AskMen,1

My girlfriend and I are usually very vocal to eachother about how much we enjoy the others company and will be very cuddly in bed. However the last two days she's been very reserved which is very rare.

We live and work together in china so we spend almost every minute together. She was sad yesterday and wanted to go for a walk alone, I asked to join her and she reluctantly accepted, she wanted to listen to her music so we didn't say a word the entire 2.5 hour walk as she requested. 

Today she doesn't want to kiss me, doesn't want to hold my hand, doesn't want to talk. I confronted her about it a few times and she tells me I'm paranoid and she's fine. But it's such a huge change in her behavior.

frlcoz,DakDak4,How to completely move on?,"
It‚Äôs been about 9 months since i broke it off with my ex. She was studying abroad and I felt the distance since the start of her trip, which led to finding out she‚Äôs been lying about certain whereabouts and people she was with. Ended up breaking up while she was still there, due to her constantly lying about things that i knew she was lying about. Crazy thing is I was actually flying out towards the end of her trip to surprise her and propose to her. 

We were together for about 3 years and she would always talk about marriage. I truly believed she was the one. Things changed in a blink of an eye. Idk who she is anymore. Although I didn‚Äôt want it to end, I mainly wanted her to communicate and be real with me. She hit me with the she‚Äôs not ready to talk and that she‚Äôs not ready for a relationship. I let it go, she would contact me every few weeks asking how I‚Äôm doing and that she misses me, but still never able to talk to me about what really happened. She would say things like she‚Äôs not the woman I deserve and that she‚Äôs working on herself and she thinks with more time things would be better between us. Well recently I found out she‚Äôs been dating someone else, going on trips with him, possibly even living together. I‚Äôm over it for the most part, but at times I still can‚Äôt understand wtf happened. How do we go from being the perfect couple to complete strangers. 

I guess I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how to completely let go and not overthink when she crosses my mind. It‚Äôs exhausting. For the most part I‚Äôm good, I can go months without worry or thinking about her, but at a random moment I think about her and lose my shit. How could someone be so cold towards someone they supposedly loved and wanted to spent the rest of their lives with.",19,1585548027,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/frlcoz/how_to_completely_move_on/,AskMen,1

frj3bo,belalugozi666,"Hi there men, how can I approach my fiance about lack of passion?","Sorry if the title sounds crude or lacking of empathy, or if the post itself does. I just want to get a guy's take on this if willing.
Obligatory I love my partner to the moon; we have been together almost three years, and plan to get married in the next. Started off with any good ol' honeymoon phase--one I'd actually consider lasted longer than usual--and have lived together for the majority of our relationship (kinda just happened, we are great housemates). We consider each other best friends and have an open line of communication about almost everything... except one. I'm a horny gal. I have multiple toys and would honestly use them everywhere from the kitchen to the bedroom if I could, but he's just not into it. I could fuck all day. He'd rather bang one out for a few minutes and be done with it. Sex between us happens when I pursue it, 99% of the time. The 1% is when he's got morning wood, which is awesome but... I just feel like we're heading towards a passionate-less relationship. We have talked about it more than once, and it honestly used to frustrate me, but at this point I'm just plain bummed and feel like I'm doing something wrong or he really just doesn't care. Like, I took off my engagement ring a few days ago and he still hasn't said anything.
So, if anyone even takes the time to read this, lemme know a thought or two. And again, sorry if this reads as pathetic or lacking of empathy for my man. I really miss him.",3,1585537534,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/frj3bo/hi_there_men_how_can_i_approach_my_fiance_about/,AskMen,1

I've been at my job for close to half a year and I haven't been able to be myself around my boss. I'm intimidated by him because he's my superior (afraid of getting in trouble or saying something wrong) and I have to admit I'm a bit attracted to him. I now try to avoid seeing him whenever I can. When I first started I would go into his office whenever I needed to, to ask questions or to turn in stuff. Now I just ask him questions over chat or drop things off in his mailbox. I'll say hi and bye if I see him in the hallway but other than that we don't really talk. When I first started he would try to make small talk to get to know me and I would respond with small talk, but now he doesn't because I guess I've been giving off a shy vibe. It's just so awkward now. I'm not shy and can be myself around my other coworkers but I cannot seem to relax/be myself around my boss. How do I fix this? I do have to mention that my boss is also introverted and is not the most outgoing person according to my coworkers who have been there long, but he gets along with and seems comfortable with everyone because they've all worked together for 5+ years.

friz47,kalavoyce,I have physiological erectile dysfunction at 18. How do I fix this? Please Help!,"I'm 18 years old. Since one year, my erection has slowly deteriorated. Here are my symptoms:

* I don't wake up with morning wood at all, and can't remember the last time I did.
* I don't get any random erections throughout the day. If at most it gets to 40-50% erection for a few seconds.
* I can't get an erection without several minutes of physical contact, and the erection goes away in 10-15 seconds without physical contact.
* When I masturbate, the maximum hardness my erection gets is like 70%. It is still quite soft/limp but I manage to get the job done. It isn't firm enough to stay up when I stand up and bends down. It definitely isn't hard enough for penetration.
* When I clench my pc muscles (kegel hold), it temporarily gets bigger/firmer but only for a few seconds. The size increase is quite drastic (0.5 inch). I think it gets to around 90% when I clench.
* I have a lower libido as compared to a few years ago

This wasn't always the case as I don't remember having any problems when I was younger. I would also get random erections frequently a few years ago. I've slowly noticed my condition getting worse.

I've tried several things to fix this:

* Started getting healthy. I've lost 30 kg in the past 1 year. I'm quite lean now. My bmi is 19. I'm eating healthy foods and lift weights 3-4 times a week. I've put on some muscle as well. I've recently started a proper bulk cycle to build lean mass.
* I'm taking zinc supplements.
* Have never been addicted to porn as I've always preferred looking at pictures of hot models.
* Attempted no-fap several times. Highest streak being 45 days when I noticed no improvement and have lost faith in it. I now masturbate only once every 3-4 days.

I might have either low testosterone (which I'm getting checked for once the lockdown is over), venous leak, or pelvic floor problems. I've started a kegel routine to see if it has any benefits.

I can't go to a doctor as I live in a country (India) where I don't have insurance for it.

fri2th,manilamilkshake,Should I ask him if he wants to hang out?,"23f, 24m. This is long, but please help me. I could really use some advice. I‚Äôll make a TLDR, but I don‚Äôt think it will be enough to explain. If you have the time, I would be so grateful for the help.

TLDR: this guy and I hit it off so well at first, but he‚Äôs been busy and not great at communicating. We‚Äôve hung out a couple of times, but I‚Äôve been insecure and not sure if he‚Äôs really into me anymore. Wondering if I should reach out one more time to hang out and get a clear answer about this. 

‚Äî‚Äî

Basically I matched with this guy last year. He messaged me, I ignored him for a couple months, we ran into each other at a bar and recognized each other but didn‚Äôt say anything. Couple months later I decide to message him and mention it and we ended up talking all night. I was out of the country at the time and I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd meet up with him because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was interested. He asked me when I come back and to hit him up. 

Well I came back, and I‚Äôm not the type to turn down an offer. So we met up and we had so much fun. He said we should hang out again and I agreed. Because I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like him, I was 100% myself throughout the date. And I got excited that I liked him and was going to meet up with him again. But he got confusing.

He‚Äôs an incredibly popular guy. So friendly, so loved and so smart. He had 3 jobs at the time and loved meeting up with his friends. It was hard to text him due to our different texting styles. I honestly didn‚Äôt want to talk through text, I wanted to get to know him in person. But he didn‚Äôt mention hanging out again until I said I didn‚Äôt really do anything that weekend. So we made plans for the following week!

He invited last minute by his friends to play some pool, go out for a bit and he invited me. He said whenever I felt uncomfortable we can leave. I have social anxiety and don‚Äôt go out a lot, but when I feel comfortable with the people I‚Äôm with, I know I‚Äôm fun. But I didn‚Äôt know them, and I can tend to say the wrong or inappropriate thing to people just because I‚Äôm uncomfortable. I think it‚Äôs very easy to mess up in the beginning of talking to someone bc it‚Äôs not always the case where the person is completely enthralled by you and nothing you say can mess things up. And I think I messed things up that night.

I knew I was being boring, stupid, probably a brat. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be. I just messed up and wasn‚Äôt completely myself. But I think everyone had a decent time. And throughout the whole thing, he tried to talk to me, he was getting a bit flirty and touchy, and I saw him staring at my lips. So I thought maybe we‚Äôd kiss that night.

On the drive back to my place, something felt different. You get that feeling that maybe he‚Äôs going to kiss you or something could happen. Once we parked, we were flirting. And the drinks made me confident. I told him I wanted to kiss him, and it was innocent and he pulled me back and we made out. It was a very sweet moment. And I asked him if all he was looking for a hookup, he replied that he was open to whatever turns out. And so am I really - I‚Äôm just tired of being a quick fuck.

After that, the usual. He didn‚Äôt really initiate a hangout. We‚Äôd talk once in a while, but I was confused and starting to pull back. I also felt bad about putting him in the kiss situation where I didn‚Äôt really get his consent and I apologized. He said there was nothing to be sorry about and that he enjoyed it. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he wanted to kiss me, but he was so glad that we did. I felt bad, I didn‚Äôt wanna be clingy and I think I might‚Äôve even been getting colder with him because I couldn‚Äôt tell why he was treating me this way and what he wanted. I was just trying to prepare myself for the worst.

I finally asked him to hang out again like after 2 weeks? And he said he‚Äôd be happy to. We went to a bar, he was rubbing my thighs and looking at my lips again as we made conversation. We got high and went to see a movie. Unfortunately I hadn‚Äôt gotten high in a looong time and it hit me HARD. I felt like I was embarrassing myself because I had no control over my behavior. But we got to see the movie by ourself at the theater, we were cuddly and he was making sure I was ok. Afterwards we listened to music in his car, we drove to the top of a garage, and he asked me if I wanted to kiss him (poking fun at the fact that I said that last time). I teased him back and was like I guess if you want to üôÑ. He thought that was funny and told me he wanted to kiss me. So we kissed and it turned out to a make out again. I tend to get uhhh...horny when I get high and I started grinding on him and feeling him up. We got back to his car and made out again. I was so embarrassed about my behavior but he reassured me he didn‚Äôt regret it. Talked some more, then drove me home. Made out again.

Again...barely talking through text, no word about hanging out. At this point I was questioning things hard. I‚Äôm overthinking and wondering where I went wrong. 

I finally ask him to hang out again 3 weeks later and bought him something small (literally $3) bc I told him I‚Äôd buy it for him and I wanted to keep my promise. He was busy that entire week (and he really hasn‚Äôt lied to me throughout this whole thing), so I understood. He invited me to play soccer with his friends once, but couldn‚Äôt hang out afterwords bc of work. We met again the next week, he had to reschedule two times, but we met. And this time, he had to meet late bc he had a birthday party to attend for a friend I‚Äôve met before. I thought he would invite me to that, but he just said we can meet later. He‚Äôs always been the type of guy to be late to everything - he‚Äôs just so chill lmao. So my anxiety over this whole thing, questioning if he liked me or not or was just being nice and didn‚Äôt want to disappoint me was getting to me. I was kinda irritated when I met him that night. He seemed really sleepy...but I might be making excuses for him? He wasn‚Äôt his usual sweet self and that made me nervous and I might‚Äôve looked like I was trying to hard to relate to him. I‚Äôm not that type of person, but god damn I got nervous. I was off that night and maybe he was too. But he still called me beautiful and held my hand.

When he dropped me off, I finally just said to him that if he‚Äôs not interested, it‚Äôs ok. He was probably surprised by this question, but he said he likes hanging out with me...he‚Äôs just not in the point of his life for a relationship. He had other priorities and 4 jobs to take care of. And I really really really wasn‚Äôt expecting him to think I meant a full-on relationship - I just wanted to know if he actually did wanna hang out with me and wasn‚Äôt just being nice. It felt kinda weird, I was confused, but we couldn‚Äôt help but make out. It got steamier this time, but when I left he said ‚Äútake care‚Äù and I felt devastated that night. I immediately deleted his number and have been really, really fucking sad since.

It‚Äôs been a month. With spring break and the coronavirus, I knew we wouldn‚Äôt meet for a while (if it were to happen). I haven‚Äôt heard from him, but he was always like this. And I think I need for myself a clear answer if he genuinely likes me and wants to hang out. Because he seems like the type to be used to being asked about hanging out just cause he‚Äôs so popular. But again, am I making excuses for him?

However, I‚Äôm very 50/50 on this. I know situations can be different, but I don‚Äôt want to be naive. Maybe the silence should be an answer, but I haven‚Äôt been able to feel at peace about this. My pride is hurt and I don‚Äôt want to be the one to text him first. I wish he would just text me, but I‚Äôm being realistic. I want to text him and hang out with him again to talk about this. Whatever he says, if he wants to hang out again I‚Äôd be reassured and not feel as bad. If he rejects me, it‚Äôd hurt like a bitch but then I‚Äôll know. 

I‚Äôve been so confused and debating this. I have NO idea what to do. I wanna ask him if he wants to go to a park, or ask him a question about a friend, and then see if he would want to meet. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd deny me to hang out, but I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared of the potential outcome and I‚Äôm scared of looking stupid and clingy. I‚Äôm so scared.

What should I do? At this point I‚Äôm not trying to change his mind about a relationship because I know we‚Äôre not at that point. But I enjoy hanging out with him and want to get to know him. If I see this isn‚Äôt going anywhere, then I know my friends would be honest with me and I‚Äôd let things go. But because there had been so much time in between dates and I messed up, I wanna be given the chance to show him me.

I don‚Äôt ever feel like this about guys. I know when I‚Äôll get along with people and if we‚Äôll connect. And we really did at first. And I want to remind him that we connected so well for a reason. I feel like this can‚Äôt be the end for us. Or maybe I just don‚Äôt want to believe it. I don‚Äôt know. He doesn‚Äôt owe me anything, but would it really hurt to try to see him again and figure this out?

I‚Äôm sorry for the novel, but please have patience with me. I‚Äôve been so conflicted with this and really could use some advice. Anyone that was willing to read this and help, I appreciate you so much.

frhc1h,JesseAy9,How do I start enjoying things by myself? How you started being happy without the need of a partner? I feel so lost since month... really want to read your stories.,"My last relationship was 5 years ago and after that i had a really good time with spending time alone. I was ok. Not the happiest one, but really good. I'm in general a really hyperactive guy and always need to do something. I tried a looot of hobbys and enjoyed them. But couple of month ago, after that dry dateless time i dated a girl, because i really felt alone after that long time being single. 

I don't think that it is gonna work with her,  even though I felt in love, i don't see hope for us. I barely enjoy things alone. I love to make people happy and love to care about other people and i don't have that now. I would love to travel, but not alone. With intimacy and a person i really care about.

I am doing already a lot. Going to gym since years for 4-5 times a week and startet taking Kickbox courses. But that's it. I would love to enjoy things just being alone. I mean, there is no guarantee that it's gonna work with her and i dont want to feell like that. I would love to being alone and enjoying things. 

You ever felt like that? How you managed it? Would love to read you stories.

frg08q,HermitTheKermit,"Anyone with a older brother, how do you deal with them?","Hey guys, I need some advice. Or just your thoughts.

For some backstory, I'm 18, and my brother is 20-21.

My issue is, the dude just does not listen and escalates situations for no reason. Whenever I, or my mother, or father get into an argument with him he begins to raise his voice exponentially. He begins shouting in less then a few minutes and does not stop. I've told him multiple times that he's in the wrong, that he has to be respectful, etc, but every single time he says that he isn't wrong and that he's the victim.

I'm not sure if he respects out parents. I say this because of how much he shouts. Just today he and my mother had a argument. He blew up and began shouting at her, and would not stop. This went for a while until my mother had enough. Then as he was leaving, I told him not to scream at our mother ever again like that, and he began shouting and becoming aggressive with me. This escalated physically, but no punches were thrown. Only pushing and grappling. This resulted in a whole new argument with him shouting at all of us, very loudly. At some point I told him to calm down as he was just shouting at my mother again, which resulted in him trying to attack me again but our parents getting between us. He also would not give my dad his car keys when he was asked to return them.

Another thing I want to add is that, he uses things that he has done in the past against us. If he does a nice thing for someone (mostly in the family), and does a bad thing to the same person, he'll bring up the nice thing as a point in a argument.

How do you guys deal with a shouting and aggressive person? This is the second time he's gotten physical, and I imagine if he does this again me and him are gonna fight. I want to avoid a fight, really. I really don't know how to deal with a child, so any advice could be helpful.

P.S Fighting tips would be nice too

Edit: I'm not sure if you guys care too much, but here's some more details. He usually brings up the same arguments. The first one is that he was beat as a child by our parents. However so was I and my older sister and we both turned out as people who aren't him. Also, our whole family is from Pakistan, so parents beating kids as disciplinary actions is common there. I'd also like to say that neither of our parents have hit us in any way since we immigrated to Canada, and that they provide tons of things for him. Another argument he says is that I got away with a lot of things, or that I was treated as a baby. Now, I am the youngest, and I have looked at the situation from his point of view. From the results, I have seen situations where I was treated well, but for the most part me and him were treated equally and continue to be treated equally. For example, ill do his laundry (I do everyones), and my mother will cook breakfast, lunch and dinner for him. He also has been smoking weed since he was around 16-17 (daily).

Also, this post is in no way to make me look good. I genuinely want to help him, but I will not tolerate this behavior towards my mother or father. I worry because if I leave for military service, my parents will be left with him alone.",21,1585525514,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/frg08q/anyone_with_a_older_brother_how_do_you_deal_with/,AskMen,2

frfxus,hope2overcome,How to get over extreme shyness around women?,"So, I can easily attract women with looks but when it's time to make the first move I way too extremely shy and never make the first move.   You would never think i have this issue because in everything else I am loud and proud, I show confidence when doing everything.  My entire life is going great in every aspect except the romantic side of things.  

Women (mostly at my work) give me plenty of opportunity to approach them, like a lot.  Yet, I just cannot make the first move.

How do I get over this hump of being so goddamn shy and incapable of making the first move?  I know for a fact that when I make the first move I will get the number, the date and probably a relationship.  Yet, I just cannot take the first step, I am a hard case.  Maybe I am not seeing something, would really appreciate your advice.

fre6or,mcl116,How Do You Create an Amazing &amp; Interesting Life?,"I see this idea of creating and living an interesting and awesome life thrown around a lot on sites like this and in other articles/forums. But people never really get into specifics or expand on this.  


It's become apparent to me that this is by far the most important thing to living a happy, content, confident, fulfilling life.  


Without even really knowing it, I was living a miserable depressed life. A girl I was in love with, and claimed was wildly in love with me, dumped me out of the blue. All of a sudden I questioned everything about myself, my life, couldn't stop ruminating, became completely miserable and depressed.  


Recently over the last few months, I started training for a triathlon, reading again, taking singing lessons, playing guitar and piano again, training jiu jitsu, cooking, going to therapy. As soon as this quarantine is over I plan on taking up boxing also. I'm not quite where I want to be emotionally and mentally but I am so much better than I was post break up and I think molding myself into a better man than I was before meeting my ex.  


Before my ex, all I had was a job I hated, I'd come home, hang with my roommate, order dinner and repeat. Go out on weekends with friends. Would work out routinely for 3 month periods before injuries would force me to stop. I didn't have anything else going on in my life really.  


But even with all of this going on in my life and feeling good about it, I still don't feel like I'm living this amazing awesome life. A life that somebody would be excited to be a part of and want to join me on my path. All of the things I'm doing seem very much like things only for me.  


So what kind of things do you do to create a life that is exciting and interesting that a woman would put in the effort to want to be a part of?

fr82d0,angelsanddoves,How do you salvage a relationship?,"Hi everyone, I didn't know whether or not to post it on here or another subreddit but here we go. So I (22f) have been with my boyfriend (20m) for little over a year now. We met in college and during that time for a while we had a turmulous relationship that including us experiencing with various substances which we stopped doing and getting into petty arguments but the arguments weren't happening frequently just normal fights. In January, we both moved back to our respective states and entered a long distance relationship- we live roughly 4 hours apart. 

Since moving away from each other we have been having petty arguments and I believe it's because we live apart and we're not used to being away from each other for this long plus since this pandemic is happening we have no clue as to when we'll see each other again. When we argue, we usually come back to our senses and realize it was a stupid argument. A month ago, a co-worker gave me tiny pinky finger bump of speed and I right away decided to tell him about it because we agreed on being open in whatever we do and he had told me to just be careful. Then, we got into an argument that day because I guess he didn't know that speed is meth and said how could you that, you told me you would never do that, etc. and I told him that I would never do it again and I even changed my schedule because he suggested it so I won't be influenced and even started talking to a therapist. I also want to say that I have been relatively sober since moving home minus that awful incident and a glass of wine with my mom back in early Feburary. 

Last week, I came to him telling him that I feel insecure in the relationship because of how he treated me last year (which I've forgiven him but it takes time for me to get over it because it really did a number on me in regards of my self esteem) and I just wanted to be open and communicative with him because we both agreed to do so. When I told him, it ended in an argument because he said that he's obviously changed and I basically shouldn't dwell on the past because he is a different person and he loves me and I shouldn't compare myself to other people. What I wanted to do was just let him know that I'm feeling insecure and the reason why and I never intended on it becoming an argument. That Thursday, we decided to take a break so he can have some space and so he can create some boundaries because he felt as though I frequently come to him telling him my problems and I get now that I shouldn't always do that because he is not my therapist and there should be a line between that. 

Fast forward to today, he told me that he wants to break up because he is still stuck on me taking a bump of speed and that he has lost all trust in me. It hurt me because I thought we had talked it over and I promised him that I would never ever touch that stuff and it was just a one time thing. We talked on the phone and at the end he said he would think about everything I said and that we will talk Monday. 

When we were together last year, for the better part of the beginning he wasn't the best partner but I stuck by him and was patient because I saw the good in him and I knew that he can change and become a better person- which he has. 

I guess why I'm here is because I don't know what to do...I want us to continue out relationship because he is honestly such an amazing person and I care for him a lot and we've both made tremendous growth. I have been working really hard on becoming a better partner for him and becoming a better person and I wish he could see that. I'm just confused as to why I had been so patient with him last year even though he continued to hurt me but he has become a better person but he can't do the same with me even though I fucked up one time. Is there a way as to how I can try to gain his trust back? Is this just another stupid argument? Am I in the wrong or is he overreacting? I don't know what to think right now...

TL;DR: I broke a promise I made and now my boyfriend wants to break up. I profusely apologized and told him that it was the worst mistake I could ever make. I don't want the relationship to end and I really want to salvage it.",1,1585497543,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fr82d0/how_do_you_salvage_a_relationship/,AskMen,1

The 2014 OkCupid statistics said that it‚Äôs harder for African American women (and Asian men) when it comes to online dating but  I‚Äôm positive Indian women also face a similar scenario when it comes to online dating but are not highlighted in the statistics due to being an even smaller minority and for Indians usually falling into the asian category (which I believe we should not fall under as south Asians look very different from what is usually perceived as Asian).

fr2qdi,RogerSterlingCooper,How do you stop feeling miserable and love yourself again? [Serious],"Hi everyone. Since we're all stuck at home and are running out of things to do, I was just reflecting back at my life and the things I've done. I just ended up hating myself for all the things I've done, falling for the wrong people and hating myself for not being able to control my feelings, just like everyone else I want to be loved. I have made a lot of friends throughout my life but I just feel to embarrassed to tell any of them about how I feel, because I tried once and it's all like ""just forget about her, you deserve much better"" I know they're doing their job but it doesn't fix anything. For guys it's much harder develop feelings for someone and finally get to be with them, the fear of rejection, all the time you spend building up your confidence, just waiting for the right time to confess your feelings, all of that it takes a lot of time and once you mess up, it all goes down the drain. I just want to get over all of this, I literally cannot be bothered with all this relationship fuckery, I've had enough of these women, feeling loved is great but all that has just ends up being painful, in my experience at least.

I just want to know what can I do to learn how to forgive myself, and love myself again, because I know I have a lot of potential to be something then to get dumped or played by someone or be rejected by someone.

The 2014 OkCupid statistics said that it‚Äôs harder for African American women (and Asian men) when it comes to online dating but  I‚Äôm positive Indian women also face a similar scenario when it comes to online dating but are not highlighted in the statistics due to being an even smaller minority and for Indians usually falling into the asian category (which I believe we should not fall under as south Asians look very different from what is usually perceived as Asian).


It‚Äôs hard to talk about this topic irl, thus wanted an honest answer from a stranger who‚Äôs willing to say the truth without sugarcoating it.

fr1qrj,unsersame,How does a smaller/weaker man cope with imasculation from larger men?,"Quick exposition dump; I'm a skinny, slightly shorter (5'9"") guy in my early twenties. I work retail for a small retail store and am often left in charge of closing and looking after the store in the evenings. Recently due to covid19 my work's sales have dropped drastically and we're only staying afloat through the sale of masks and hand sanitizer. Due to high demand we have been forced to increase the cost of these items as our suppliers have also increased theirs.

This brings me to the title. On my shift today a guy, (6'4""ish) with a fairly large build, walks in and asks the price of our sanitizer. I tell him the inflated price, he scoffs at me and walks out. Fair enough. 
However, seconds later he walks back in and says he'll take one. I'm a bit surprised but I put one out on the counter and say the price again. He then reaches over, grabs the bottle, throws a dollar at me and sarcastically says ""there's your payment,"" and starts walking out the store. 
Obviously, I try to telling him to wait/pay/""you can't do that""/blah-blah but he just scoffs again looks me full in the face and says ""I don't give a f_ck, what are you gonna do,"" and walks off. 
I couldn't do anything. He could've taken anything he wanted, broken stuff, etc. and there was nothing I could do.

fqyrwc,WardTheFountain,How do I be a Man Without being Desperate in this situation," So I'm in a bit of turmoil right now. I have been dating this girl for 3 months and she seems to have a lot of guy friends and although I knew this before dating her, I didn't really know that it would affect me more and more the deeper we got into our relationship. I don't want to seem desperate by wanting her attention 24/7 but when she's on a Skype call with this particular best friend of hers since middle school (We are currently freshmen in college) for hours on end (due to the quarantine), it just makes me extremely uncomfortable and I know that she isn't suddenly gonna break up ties with him after they have been close friends for 8 or so years. Along with that, there's also the majority of her other friends that are also guys and her reasoning for not having more girlfriends (she only has like 2 or 3 good ones) is that they just cause drama and aren't fun to hang around with. My worst worry is that this situation is only gonna get worse as the summer comes around because I can't see her all the time because my parents are very strict which is the complete opposite of her lifestyle. I just don't want other guys to touch her and stuff because although it might only seem like friends interacting with each other, it just doesn't feel right to me and please tell me if I'm being jealous or something over this whole situation. And with her ""best friend"", she even told me that he tries to flirt with her when they are drunk but she assured me that they will only be friends and she will only be my GF. Because she hangs around with him and another boy during college basically all the time because they have the exact same schedule and classes, I always worry about the worst happening and I just don't want that to unfold. Is there any way to assert my dominance in this relationship or to get her to have more girlfriends? I literally won't even turn an eye if she spends 23 hours and 59 minutes with her girlfriends and only one minute with me but because it's not another girl, and me being a guy knows what/why other guys want to hang around with girls, it's just super weird and awkward.

When women have spoken to me over the years, there's always been some logical, practical reason behind it. I've never noticed any excessive or unnecessary friendliness or flirtaction being directed to me from the female gender and on the odd occasions I've tried to elicit this kind of response from them it's not really led anywhere beyond minimal courtesy. At bars/pubs I never see women ""giving me the eye"" or even looking at me and never been hit on/flirted with by female customers at work. I guess I'm asking, is this the experience the majority of guys have, or do most guys get some degree of unsolicited attention from women at some point?

fqn33b,cccbig,How do you distinguish real friendships from fake / superficial ones?,"After I ended an internship I contacted 2 coworkers I enjoyed talking to. One answers my emails. The other one made clear she doesn't want to talk to me. I'm baffled.

For what is worth I enjoyed talking to most of the coworkers there, but specially to these 2.

I am baffled and a bit sad, because the one who doesn't want to talk to me (just answered cryptically wishing me good) is the one who helped me the most, not only on work related issues (I am an immigrant), but on regular life issues, like how to pay taxes, for instance. For me that was real friendship. I even told her I am moving onto a new home and she immediately said she would help. What could go wrong?

Apparently I was wrong. It hurts a bit that some people can be so friendly face to face and then forget you that fast, now that I no longer work there.

The other coworker, not being as helpful, was always a very authentic person and is why I want to talk to her. I want authentic people in my life.

Professionally: my manager has always treated me favorably and rewarded my hard work. I feel I have a duty to the patients, physicians, and my manager and team during this time. Some of my team has opted out, and some are sticking it out. This would involve a lot of driving to cover cases and staying in hotels overnight.

Sometimes family needs to come first, but I know I also have a responsibility for what I signed on for. I‚Äôm trying to think of a good compromise - maybe work until we get pregnant?

However, due to being female, I have very little understanding of how men think and feel when it comes to activities of an NSFW nature. Therefore, I have come to you for enlightenment!

The things that I specifically need your help in understanding are the physical and emotional feelings involved with regards to handjobs, blowjobs, and vaginal sex. The more adjectives and analogies you could provide to help with my understanding, the better. Although I'm sure any level of explanation is bound to be better than the understanding I have at this present point in time.

Thank you in advance - you are doing future female smut authors and male fanfiction readers a service!",19,1585405987,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fql919/how_would_you_describe_the_physical_and_emotional/,AskMen,1

I‚Äôve always been quite quick in the bedroom, I believe it‚Äôs mostly mental cos I get anxious about not bussing in 2 strokes, 
In my relationship I managed to last longer as I felt comfortable, my partner knew and I was able to take my time or switch things up to last longer.

Since the break up, I‚Äôve had sex twice. One was a very drunk night in which I was basically too drunk to cum, so I lasted a long time.

But the other day, sober I had sex with a girl, and due to the fact I wasn‚Äôt drunk I was thinking about not cumming fast, and well when we had sex I lasted about 30 seconds. Literally felt like I was going to bust, as soon as we started.

fqkb1c,sweetsauthorized,The guy I like likes someone else?,"
So backstory, me and this guy (both 21) dated for a while, and ended it because there were just too many problems. Anyway so we started talking again a few weeks back and it was going so great, no issues at all. He said from the beginning he wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship right now, and I told him that was ok. I wasn‚Äôt forward with him to respect his choice but then he started being very forward with me and flirting like he used to when we were together. Then, I saw he was following some girl on social media and I asked him about it and he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the girl I met that I like‚Äù. I was very upset of course and I asked him if we should stop talking since he likes someone else and he said that he likes me too. I don‚Äôt know what to do because I‚Äôm seriously in love with him but I feel cheated even though we weren‚Äôt together. Also I don‚Äôt want to be just another option to him or the last resort. I don‚Äôt really want to stop talking to him either because I really like him and I want it to work out with us in the future. Also I‚Äôm confused as to why he would say he doesn‚Äôt want a relationship but then meets a new girl and is interested in her? I guess that only applies to me then? He said he doesn‚Äôt want to be with me because we‚Äôd had problems in the past but the issues we had were childish and immature on my part and I‚Äôve matured way past that and I don‚Äôt see Us ever having those issues again. I know deep down he sees that too. I think it‚Äôs fair that he likes someone else because we‚Äôre not together but it‚Äôs not fair that he was leading me on and making me think our relationship was going somewhere, he knows I really like him and want to be with him.

To put things into perspective I'd happily take a bullet for this guy. He's very understanding and has great advice, but at the same time isn't afraid to call me out on my bullshit. He got me to open up a bit about the issues I've been facing, particularly my lack of success with dating (I'm almost 26 and have never had a girlfriend). It's been weighing on my mind pretty heavily as of late.

He let me vent for a while before saying something that stunned me with how accurate it was, and I still can't believe I was so blind to it in the past. Paraphrasing here, but in essence:

""You're a good dude; you've got a good job and know how to take care of yourself. You actually give a shit about other people and want to help them. But honestly? You're just kind of boring, my man. There's nothing about you that really 'pops'. Find something that makes you stand out from the crowd.""

And he's 100% right. There's nothing really ""interesting"" about me. I've got an average job, average hobbies, average outlook on things. I'm about as exciting as a bowl of Cheerios.

fqha3w,AnyPea3,help a middle aged guy out of his funk...,"Hi all, 

I'm a guy in my 40s feeling a bit despondent and looking for advice. 

Basically here is my situation. I have a good job(not making millions but far away from poor), I'm married to a wonderful woman (no kids), and I'm quite successful in my field. I have been lucky enough to live abroad for over 10 years of my life, learnt two foreign languages, and got to experience a lot of great things. I'm a good cook and fairly physically fit. Sex life is good and no health issues.  

The problem is, I feel recently like my life is over and I'm just waiting to die. All the joy has gone out of my life and everything feels just so routine. I feel like I could tell you when I wake up exactly what my day will be like and probably exactly what my week or month will be like. I know I should feel grateful but I just feel bored. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger, life seemed so exciting and there was so much potential but now I just feel like I'm on a downward slope and things are just going to get worse. I find it hard to get excited by anything these days. Everything feels predictable and stale and I feel like I don't want to do anything because, well, what's the point? I find it hard to really get into anything in the ways I did in the past. Nothing really excites me and I end up just doing nothing. 

I dunno if I'm having a midlife crisis or what but any advice from anyone would be welcome!",1,1585389787,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fqha3w/help_a_middle_aged_guy_out_of_his_funk/,AskMen,1

Anyways, today I asked him today what he wanted to do for his birthday and he said he wanted to go to either California or back to Miami to visit family and just to be with me outside of the state.

The list goes on and on but just to sum it up, he‚Äôs an amazing human being. 
However, I really want to surprise him but how? I need help!!! 

Should I buy the plane tickets and go or what should I do!!! I want to keep it a surprise but I gotta start thinking about it soon so I can get the ball rolling. He has such a toxic past relationship and no girl has ever done anything special for him not even on his birthdays which is the most important time and considering how this man would give you the shirt off his back it‚Äôs a shame no girl even gave him the time of day on his actual birthday to make him feel like the king he is.

fqeidh,flybyfrootie,How to politely tell a guy to text less,"TL;DR is the title 

Men of reddit, how can I gently tell this guy I just started dating to ease up on texting me? With all of these virus shenanigans, both of us (Im 35F, he‚Äôs 33m) are quarantined at our own places and we live an hour apart. He‚Äôs constantly texting me throughout the day, it‚Äôs sometimes feels like we are near each other. And he knows I‚Äôve been sitting at home alone all day doing nothing. I try to take longer to text back, sometimes I‚Äôll just not respond. I don‚Äôt think he has expectations on us constantly being in communication, it might just be the way he is. But I also think the loneliness/isolation is hitting him way harder than it is me, I need and cherish my alone time and personal space (but this is a bit much even for me lmao)

I feel like this could be something great but I also need time to get over my past relationship that ended in September. But we hit it off so perfectly in the beginning, I didn‚Äôt plan on being involved with someone for awhile. He keeps saying how happy I‚Äôm making him and how much he misses me, it‚Äôs been less than a week since I‚Äôve seen him. And yesterday our state became officially on lockdown so we don‚Äôt know when we can see each other next.

I know I should just be honest but I think he‚Äôs going through some things and isn‚Äôt in the best headspace. I also know his mental health isn‚Äôt my responsibility, but I do care. I feel like even if I say something like, ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs nothing to do with how I feel about you but we should try texting a little less, give ourselves some space‚Äù he will comply and text less, but he‚Äôll think I don‚Äôt like him anymore and his feelings will be hurt. To be more clear, I‚Äôm not concerned with him losing interest in me but rather him being sad that I‚Äôm the one losing interest. When we do see each other, these feelings go away and we have a really amazing time together. It just feels perfect and equal. Hate that we met when I‚Äôm trying live my ‚Äúbest‚Äù single life haha

So what can someone say to you to text/communicate less often that wouldn‚Äôt hurt your feelings? Sorry for the long post, thanks for reading!",30,1585375188,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fqeidh/how_to_politely_tell_a_guy_to_text_less/,AskMen,1

Well, years went by, and nothing happened like that again. I moved forward because we all do stupid stuff in high school. We got married, and now, three years into our marriage I find that he texted her first saying hello and he Hope's she is well with stupid heart emojis included.

What angers me is he had to go through the trouble of finding her number and unblocking it in his phone! He has had the same number for years.

She had no idea who he was. But then he texted her another night while drunk and the next morning she replied with, ""I had a dream about you last night.""

He tried to lie about it. He claims he doesn't know why he did it and that he has no feelings for her. But I am concerned. I've never drunkenly texted an ex and anytime I did happen to accidentally get drunk, I always wanted my husband. So i really dont know what to think.

I need a ""man brain"" perspective on this and maybe on reasons why he would. He just tells me he doesn't know why he did it.

I broke the news to her earlier today about me going to another university and she‚Äôs worried about it being awkward between us and is asking me to reconsider.

I‚Äôm trying to move on but still wanna be friends with her. Is it possible for us to still remain close friends after all this and with us going to different cities for universities?

I know he‚Äôs a much higher up guy who probably doesn‚Äôt have the time in the day, but I feel like he‚Äôs capable of teaching me much more than my assigned younger mentor can.

My question being, can I go and ask him for career advice, advice on how I‚Äôm doing and how I can be better, so on and so forth? I am a much younger female employee, and I‚Äôm afraid if that‚Äôs getting in the way and gets taken in the wrong way. He clearly has a more fun rapport with the guys around the office, while I and him speak strictly on professional terms and I never joke or laugh around him. I guess I‚Äôm scared of talking more frankly, as I don‚Äôt want to be considered as a risk to them, because they feel I‚Äôm being inappropriate. I know it sounds strange, but it‚Äôs easier for the guys to joke around, and I feel left out. Do you as a boss mind it? How can I do it and be¬†‚Äòone of the guys‚Äô?

I‚Äôve never had a serious teacher/mentor before, and I‚Äôd like to make the best of the situation that I can.

fq8g99,the_world_is_yours69,"Just got her number, wondering how to go about it given the situation","I‚Äôll try and quickly summarize my current situation, looking for some advice...

I matched with a girl on tinder a little over a month ago. We exchanged snapchats and built up a routine of snapchatting each other every day (she could very well be doing this with multiple guys, but I looked at it like a positive if she was responding and initiating). I wanted to hang out with her while we were at school, but I was busy with work, tests, and didn‚Äôt know how she felt. 

Now we‚Äôre on spring break and have been away from school for 2 weeks. I realized I liked her and really regretted not trying to get to know her more while at school. Last night, I asked for her number and she said of course and gave it to me. I texted her and we talked about random stuff for a few hours, I asked her questions and she would ask me questions until it died out. 

I‚Äôm going back to school this weekend, she said she plans on returning soon but isn‚Äôt sure when. I‚Äôm lost what to do since I can‚Äôt really text her and say hey let‚Äôs hangout given the global pandemic. I‚Äôve mentioned that I want to see her and she said she would be down.

My question is given that I don‚Äôt really know when I‚Äôd be able to see her, do I keep talking to her or would that seem clingy? I would way prefer text over snap and I would love to talk to her somewhat consistently but I have no idea how she would feel about that.

fq6dfe,cekin123,"we have great connection but she has a boyfriend, what to do"," 

so let me just explain my situation

I'm 18 its my first year in college in a different city, there is a really pretty girl at residence who I started speaking to about 4 months in. I think she was into me at first when we started texting, she put a lot of effort in and I really did not because I knew she had a bf so I would not even try, anyways one night she invites me over to help her study and we had the ""night"". No not sex, we really connected and got to know more about each other staying up until 4 am. This pretty much turned into a 3-4 time a week thing where she or I would just come over and talk.

Anyways the boyfriend situation; they have been together for 4 years but as of right now they are really not on good terms, at one point they even broke up but eventually got back, I asked her why and she admitted that because its been 4 years its hard for her to let go and she knows she is dumb for doing that, obviously i'm not gonna tell her ""no you need to break up with him"" so I just left it

2 months in we're hanging out every day except the weekends when she has to go back to see the family and she obviously stops by to see her boyfriend. Whenever I come over we usually lay in the same bed just talking and we are pretty much touching each other, there has been a couple drunk nights where we were seriously touching each other but nothing happened. We snap chat each other every day, have our own jokes and phrases that only we use and overall its fun just being around her.

I had to go back to my city which is in a different province because of the virus and before I left she stayed over the weekend when she could have went home to hang out with me and I remember hugging her because she was crying the day I'm leaving. So being away we still talk pretty much all day, there has been 4 nights in a row where we facetimed each other late for like 4 hours BUT here is the real issue.

I have 4 more months before I go back to college and I can't keep doing this, I don't really wanna talk to her about it because we're just having fun and I'm happy at the moment and I don't know how that talk would go if he had it. I'm even at a point where I do not even want to talk to any other girls for some reason, like I find no interest in them, so what should I do; tell her how I feel or let time tell

fq0xqn,InnanaB,[Serious] Where does the fear that women are actively trying to manipulate men come from?,"In the midst of this lockdown, I (25F) find myself really wanting to gain a better understanding of the male perspective, outside of echo chambers like Twitter, etc. I've been listening to a lot of Joe Rogan podcasts, and stumbled across this video of one of his guests (Anthony Cumia) talking about how he believes that romantic love doesn't actually exist.

If you scroll down and read the comments, you'll see loads and loads of guys commenting about how women will only love you for as long as you have a steady job or stable health, etc. This was touched upon and agreed upon wholeheartedly in the podcast as well.

I find this fascinating, given that most heterosexual women I know want nothing more than to love a man unconditionally, and to be loved equally by him in return. Women seem to generally just want a man who is willing to be vulnerable with them, and I genuinely believe that inconsequential shit like how tall he is or how much money he has in the bank are initially irrelavant, even with exceedingly attractive women (again, just judging this based on friends, acquaintances, etc).

I know women who have fallen hopelessly, madly in love with men who barely had a dollar to their name. Personally, I have dated men with a lot of money, and I've dated men who worked in retail. The most in love I have ever been was with a guy who still lives with his parents. I've never seen examples of the stereotype that women are just out to use and abuse irl; and I'm from Los Angeles, what should be considered one of the most traditionally status-obsessed cities in the world. But maybe I'm wrong? I'd really like to hear a man's take on this.

fpxshy,lurrrrrrrrk,"My friend saw that I was looking at a naked man online, and now he probably think's I'm gay...","I \[M28\] am a straight male. However, I've always had a preoccupation with being naked in front of groups of people. This preoccupation includes a fascination with nude scenes. I enjoy watching male actors do nude scenes and imagining what it would feel like to be naked on set.

I was recently sharing my screen Skyping with one of my best friends, and I accidentally opened up a different tab that I had mistakenly left minimized. It was a clip from a mainstream HBO show of a male actor doing a nude scene. I closed it as quickly as I could, but I am sure that he saw that it was a naked GUY, not a naked GIRL. Now he's acting weird, and I can only assume that it's because he thinks I'm gay (which obviously makes sense).

What should I do? I feel that the actual explanation (preoccupation with nudity) isn't exactly less weird than actually being gay. I feel like any conversation we would have about it would just make the whole thing even more awkward. BUT -- I also don't want him to think that I'm gay. I'm torn.

I read some stuff on his phone about their relationship and it sounded like she just dragged him along and he was so madly in love with her. She was emotionally abusive and controlling and he was willing to go along with that for years.  I think he is still bound to her and unable to move on.  They see each other a few times a week, probably more often than him and I see each other.
I feel like I could be a rebound or just a fwb to him. He‚Äôs told his ex about me and I feel like it‚Äôs an attempt to make her jealous.

fpulmm,WaterResources,How do you really move on after a messy breakup?,"Well, like the title says, It was a messy breakup.

She left saying that she‚Äôll tell me the reason in the future.  Maybe I am equally at fault as she is as to why the relationship didn‚Äôt work, or maybe one person more than the other. Forgetting that, she‚Äôs moved on in like a blink of an eye and it kinda messed me up.

I‚Äôve been trying to distract myself with friends, video games, painting and many more, but as soon as I‚Äôm alone with my thoughts, everything comes flooding back in. The what could‚Äôve been, what I should‚Äôve said, what I could‚Äôve done or maybe just what it was. 

I‚Äôve also been listening to podcasts at night just so I have something to disturb me till I fall asleep but I just zone out from the podcast. Everything‚Äôs a mess right now. From family problems all throughout my childhood to stress to this. 

Sometimes I do feel guilty because I feel like I‚Äôm not appreciating what I have when others have way less than me, I try to be happy and sometimes I genuinely am happy but it‚Äôs not something that lasts. 

I need advice on how to move on completely? Or do we never? 
I‚Äôm confused as to whether we really do move on from people we care about because I still love her and will always do.(I believe so?) 
She became the first person I really wanted to take care of and grow old with and now that‚Äôs gone it‚Äôs hard to think that someone else with take that place.

And when they do initiate, it'd be a dry ""hi"" or ""intro please""

fpsz4y,PotulnaCmaralka,"Why is it that as a confident, loud, extroverted woman, I don't attract confident extroverted men, and only quiet introverts seem to be interested in me?","What am I doing wrong?

The thing is, I don't like the quiet types. God knows I TRIED. It took me years to figure that out. So many times I thought, ""well, he's cute, let's see, maybe it can work out"", but it never did. I'd always get frustrated on the first date, or even before it, because the quiet guys that have tried to chat me up over the years always took forever to ask me out, and even then they did it via a text, or worded it in a way that just didn't scream confidence. And they never actually started any conversation, just waited for me to do it. And then there's the stuff like.. they didn't even know what food to order for themselves. They just waited for me to order food and then they'd order the same thing. Every. Single. Time. 0 iniciative. Just waiting on me to make all the decisions. I can't stand this. It's not what I want. I want someone straightforward, confident, extroverted, someone like me, who wouldn't be slowing me down.

There's one more thing. This might be just me, but the way quiet guys have been approaching me is often kinda.. creepy. It's all staring, weird and creepy personal questions that come out of nowhere, not saying anything when we're standing face to face but then sending me 5 paragraphs long messages on facebook messanger. Maybe there's nothing wrong with all this, I don't know. Point is, I personally don't like it.

But I feel like the confident, extroverted guys I like just don't like me, and they often seek out the quiet girls. Maybe I've just been unlucky. I hope I've just been unlucky. But it sure makes me feel kind of miserable. 

I wonder if there's something seriously wrong with me. Because 90% of the time it's *one type of guy* that I attract.

I wonder, is it possible for 2 extroverted idiots to fall for each other, or am I forever doomed because opposites are supposed to attract? Because that sure as hell doesn't work for me.",17,1585295446,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fpsz4y/why_is_it_that_as_a_confident_loud_extroverted/,AskMen,1

fpswvc,Scribbles_,How do you emotionally support your male friends? Are you the sort of friend your friends could cry to?,"Recently, I've seen a lot of men discussing their lack of social support systems outside of their mothers and girlfriends/wives. It appears many men feel as though their personal problems matter less to society or their social groups than women's problems. So putting aside societal oncenrs, I was wondering how we, as men, can sometimes contribute to our male friends feeling isolated or unable to open up without judgement, and how we could change to let our friends be more vulnerable around us.

A lot of this obviously comes from the way that men are socialized and pervading beliefs that we're all very familiar with, like men are supposed to be strong and unmoved, never cry, never ask for help, never show vulnerability (or 'weakness').

But I believe some of it might also be the way the we react to our friends vulnerability, the way we talk in social situations about men than seem to need help, the way we react when our friends cry, and the level of concern we show for our male friends' emotional well-being.

So that lead me to a couple questions:

How do you show your male friends you're emotionally there for them?

How would/do you react if your friend cried/cries? (outside of major grief or pain, rather cried out of frustration or a lesser sadness) Do you judge men who cry?

(If you believe men lack support structures) How can you be part of a good support structure for the men in your life?

Do you make fun of your friends if they seem vulnerable or 'weak'? Do you make fun of other men for being vulnerable or 'weak'?

Do you think you've fostered relationships where your friends can ask you for (emotional) help without judgement?",154,1585295080,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fpswvc/how_do_you_emotionally_support_your_male_friends/,AskMen,1

fpqvxu,Party-Walrus,Is this a valid reason to not come see me (LDR)?,"Hi everyone, I'm a female in a LDR and it's been really difficult with the virus. We had plans to see each other a few days ago but that was cancelled, so there's been a lot of disappointment recently. He is on the east coast completing professional school, so our LDR will most likely last 5-6 years and we are currently in the 1st year of LDR. 

With the virus moving everything online, his in-person school has been cancelled and he has told me that technically there is nothing tying him physically to the east coast. His hometown is in Socal and I am in Socal as well, so naturally as an emotional female I'd want him to come home and take this opportunity to see him especially knowing that we will have a long LDR ahead of us. Also, my birthday is coming up and with the cancelled flight recently, it would be such a blessing to get to see him. The last time I saw him was in December. 

However, he has told me 100% flat out that he is not coming home because of 3 reasons: 1) It is a lot to ask of him to uproot where he lives now and just pack up his bags back to California. 2) It is expensive (I told him he could take my flight ticket I paid for that I didn't use). 3) He is afraid since CA has more virus cases than where he is, he won't be able to travel back to his school after this virus subsides a bit. 

I have brought this up multiple times to him and typically he will get angry, saying that I guilt trip him and make him feel like I don't care about his career success and that I just constantly ask him to do things for me (which i admit, I do that even though I hate that about myself). 

I think his reasons are valid, but I don't know if they're valid enough. It's really bothering me but when I bring it up all he does is get angry again and say he is NOT coming home. What do you guys think, are his reasons valid? Am i just an annoying, overreacting girl? lol. what would you do in this situation?",1,1585284504,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fpqvxu/is_this_a_valid_reason_to_not_come_see_me_ldr/,AskMen,1

fppvvn,merestone87,"Fell for a hook, kept it to myself and now he's moved on. Was it my fault?","20s F. A few months ago, I met a guy (20s M) in another city. We clicked instantly and I found myself extremely physically attracted to him, which rarely ever happens to me. At the end of the night, he asked me to go home with him, which I politely declined even though I wanted to (I admitted this to him, he was sad ofc), and I made up a lame excuse. We talked and kissed for a long while before I finally headed out with my friends, exchanged info and went our separate ways.

Before I go on, a little background. The real reason why I declined his advance was because I was, at the time, still a virgin. No, I don't have any rigid beliefs about virginity and in fact find it to be a problematic concept in it of itself, but I do have my reasons for having avoided sex well into my 20s. Bottom line was that I just didn't really feel comfortable under those circumstances, but ofc I didn't want to get into all of that with a stranger so I lied.

I've also had this sort of scenario happen to me often throughout the years, mostly ending at this point and very rarely ever progressing into anything more. But this time something felt a little different so when I was unexpectedly back in town soon after, I reached out. To make a long story short, we ended up having a very nice date where he was incredibly affectionate and said some pretty serious things about what he wanted our future to possibly look like. We also got pretty deep about our lives, family, history etc. and so, I found myself extremely drawn to him on an emotional level as well. We slept together that night.

The next morning, everything starts off normal, we even have sex again. But of course not being used to this level of intimacy (being anxious in general), it doesn't take long for me to go into flight mode and so I end up leaving abruptly shortly after. I was also a little embarrassed at how not good I was (tmi, I didn't come) since it was my first time (he didn't know) and so I just wanted to leave before there was a chance of us getting into it again. The thing is that he wanted to spend more time together and when I did this, I think he was hurt. Not knowing whether or not it would be appropriate for me to try to get deeper, I opted for casual and we both agreed to let each other know if we were in the same city again.

Fast forward a few months later to now. We've talked a bit, but only casually and lately not at all. And yet I can't stop thinking about him. We follow each other on social media (which doesn't help) and so I keep up with his posts and see him doing the same with mine, though lately I've been really trying to hold back from doing so. While he's still super consistent, the other day I found out he's likely seeing someone now, which really stung.

I feel like it's my fault for the way I handled things, like I set the tone for what this would be. I thought I could be casual about it, but I was wrong. I felt a strong connection and closed off because of my own issues, but he has no idea. In his eyes, I was probably a carefree asshole who didn't think twice about it but the reality is that it meant more to me than he'll ever know. I don't want to message him and bring unnecessary baggage to his new relationship (?) and also at the risk of embarrassing myself. I also feel like it's been too long. But yeah. It sucks. Also wanting to move on but not currently being able to meet new people...

Hope you're all keeping safe but yeah I guess I'm wondering if anyone's ever been involved in a situation like this? Would you have reached out to the girl regardless or taken it as a sign of rejection? Did it work out in the end?

fpn05h,yankeesonlygirl,I need a different perspective on why my dentist is making these strange comments. This is the first time I‚Äôve met him.,"I had to get emergency dental work done today.  I was having a pleasant conversation with the dentist.

Then we got to all the social and medical questions. He asked why I thought I‚Äôve lost so much weight. I told  him I think it was just stress. All my tests have come back normal. (I lost 79 pounds in 6 months) ‚ÄúWhat could you possibly be stressed about? I highly doubt it‚Äôs anything that bad. Your probably making it worse than what it seems.‚Äù

I looked at him and said, ‚ÄúWe all handle stress differently.‚Äù He thunks me on the forehead, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs anything that bad.‚Äù

It when on to other social questions.

‚ÄúSo, do you work?‚Äù I told him before I got married I worked at the makeup/booze counter at the Duty Free store by the ferry dock to Victoria BC.

‚ÄúThat must have been a long time ago.‚Äù  

I ignored that one. He just wouldn‚Äôt stop. I didn‚Äôt react or say anything. When the assistant came back in, he was all smiles and started talking about dogs.

I‚Äôm used to comments from the medical profession. All the sexual comments on how to release stress, wanting to give exams without the nurse around, and calling after hours to come see them. I know how to handle that. This caught me off guard.

If this happens again, any advice on what to do?  I felt like an ass just sitting there having to listen to him.",0,1585268475,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fpn05h/i_need_a_different_perspective_on_why_my_dentist/,AskMen,1

fplzw4,dankthrone666,How to Take Life Less Seriously (27m),"Hey bois, been lurking for a bit. Really like this sub, think you as a group might have some constructive insight into some things id like to improve on. I‚Äôve always taken life too seriously. Moved to a major city when I turned 18, tried college for a while and dropped out (didn‚Äôt care about my major and was overworked, pulling 20 days on with 1 day off to support myself) and I‚Äôve been down here for the past decade basically doing nothing but putting my nose to the grindstone. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where it may be starting to pay off! 

In the last year, I‚Äôve been promoted at work and am now running a small factory. The band I helped start last year is signed to a label and is (or was, thx covid) putting the final touches on a full length. Things are looking up on paper, right? (You know, besides the covid...) The problem is twofold. I‚Äôm starting to get existentially burned out. Though I have some milestones on paper, the past decade is nothing but a blur of ass busting with very very few good memories, and I feel I‚Äôve wasted the ‚Äúwild, carefree years of youth‚Äù or however the shit you want to say it. 

I‚Äôd like to live a little, as I think it would benefit my mental health and thus give me a better chance of reaching long term goals. But I can‚Äôt enjoy taking time for myself just to enjoy the act of being, it just feels like laziness. That‚Äôs where the other problem is. I can‚Äôt seem to give myself credit for the accomplishments or milestones I‚Äôve reached so far, having pride in them just feels like narcissism and complacency. Trying very hard to not become my father. He‚Äôs a good man with many admirable qualities, but he‚Äôs an ornery workaholic, like so many dads. Doesn‚Äôt look like a good life. Didn‚Äôt expect this to be so long or rambling. Cheers if you got all the way through.",13,1585264831,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fplzw4/how_to_take_life_less_seriously_27m/,AskMen,1

fpl7cj,Conky53,Men who work out - When to bulk and when to cut?,"As the title states, when should you bulk and when should you cut? I'm the classic skinny-fat. No exercise, mediocre diet. At 5'11'', I was about 170 last August and have slowly cut down to 145. In February I started to take fitness more serious and started doing cardio every morning 5 or 6 days a week. And recently (about 3 weeks ago) switched from cardio to weight training 5 days a week (still some cardio 2-3 days a week as well). I have minimal muscle but I'm working on it and seeing progress even in three weeks. 

My dilemma - I still have a belly. I'm currently 145lbs but I'm growing restless with the cut. If I had to guess my body fat is around 16%? The marine calculator estimates I'm 14% (31in waist, 13.5in neck). I'd love to finally see some hint or glimmer of abs so I think I want to keep cutting for another 1-2 months. Honestly, even if there weren't abs, as long as I don't have a ponch I'd be happy. I'm just spinning my wheels right now and was hoping some people that have gone through a similar situation could chime in with advice.

However, in both scenarios, I never felt the need to consume myself in my career. I am not one of those people that has email on my phone, am up all night prepping for every meeting (will prep for important ones), stay super late to get things done that aren't due for a while, etc. There is nothing wrong with what I do and there is nothing wrong with people that do all the things mentioned above (my dad is one of those people).

fpbyux,christinaamark,What could be the cause of BF texting so much less? &amp; Would you even notice if a girl suddenly stopped texting a lot?," 

I've been dating this guy exclusively for about 4-5 weeks now (2.5 month LDR). From the beginning we've texted throughout the day, and we've always texted or talked on the phone a bit before bed. I realize that's not going to be sustainable every single day, but I'll admit I got used to it. It was also an even split of initiating conversation.

The past couple weeks though I've been the only one initiating any texting. He always responds and keeps the conversation going a bit. But, I've definitely been the one texting first about 75% of the time.

I feel like i am bothering him if i am texting him now, and when i told him that a few days ago, he said ""of course you're not bothering me babe. I love u.""

The past few days I've decided to just stop initiating any communication. When I didn't text in the morning, he ended up texting me first later in the afternoon (whereas he used to text me in the morning in the past). I still have responded to his texts, and we've exchanged a few. But, whereas before I'd be the one sending the evening text to talk a bit, I just don't do that.

For some reason though I'm feeling guilty about this. I'm not doing it to play games. I'm just tired of being the one trying to start communication and the way it makes me feel. 

When we do talk though, everything seems normal.. But it bother me a bit that he does not send me a goodnight text the way he did in the past too. 

What could be the cause of him texting so much less? Would you even notice if a girl suddenly stopped texting a lot?",8,1585231245,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fpbyux/what_could_be_the_cause_of_bf_texting_so_much/,AskMen,1

I am currently employed at relatively small company, but big enough that not everyone knows each other. I work here as an trainee and I have a direct supervisor who is one of the team members. I am barely in contact with the manager of our team when it comes to my work since I only report to that said supervisor. We do talk sometimes just about non work related topics. One time we were out having drinks after work and he said he thought I was pretty. 
So now my question.

fpb3ch,ByTheBurnside,What are some nice/romantic things I can do for my long distance s/o?,"So this may or may not be the place to ask but I've gotten a lot of basic platitudes and frankly obvious and pointless advice asking in relationship advice circles and the like and figured maybe the council of men would be more decisive on this one.

So jokes aside, I've been in a relationship of sorts with a girl from another state for almost a year. I'm 20 and shes turning 18 soon and her parents are super overprotective and definitely dont really understand how the internet and stuff like this works so shes been super afraid to really tell anyone about me because they might disapprove or even try to get me in legal trouble. 

So I've had a pretty limited range of things I can actually do for her that I'd love to do. Obviously I cant visit her for a while even if the distance wasnt so bad. I cant really send her anything like that. For a while shed let me like buy her lunch here and there and I know it might be wierd but that felt really nice, but shes been too worried lately.

Either way, general advice on nice/romantic things I could do would be nice, but the main reason I'm asking is as I said well have been together a year fairly soon now and I really wanna do something nice for her. Shes kinda going through a rough time right now and I feel really helpless about it and really wish I could do *something* to hopefully help her feel better and at least remind her I'm thinking of her.",11,1585227646,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fpb3ch/what_are_some_niceromantic_things_i_can_do_for_my/,AskMen,1

Lockdown really has reminded me of how little friends I have. I don't want to lay out my life story but TLDR since high school finished I have been putting myself out there and failing miserably in terms of making friends and especially finding my group. 2nd year of university is effectively over now. I have found it pretty difficult to fit in because people are so damn cliquey and cling so hard to the groups they made in their first year. While I was the ""I will talk to everyone guy"", and got unlucky with who I lived with. Start of this year I was determined to find my group and yet I failed again. 800 followers on instagram and only 2 would message me lmao 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway my mental health has taken a massive hit, and especially my self esteem. I can't see myself dating anyone. My house had a house party weeks ago (just before covid got more serious) and I could not enjoy myself at all as all I could think about was how atrocious I am, and how no girl would ever want anything to do with me. I just felt awkward all night especially as I drank a lot less than usual.

So now I have realized I have low self esteem and I guess that's something I can work on during lockdown. At the moment my main hobby is just power lifting which  I don't have access to now.

fp7lw5,squirrelade18,I(23F) took my crushes(33M) virginity without knowing that he was a virgin at first. How should I behave around him from now on?,"
Disclaimer: VERY LONG READ AHEAD.

Hello everyone, I will start with a short background to this story. I started working at a new company in October and I almost instantly felt a connection with one of my coworkers. I asked him out back in December but he rejected me due to us being coworkers and because of our age difference. Yet, even after that episode we still flirted a lot around the office. 

Fast forward to last week when due to this Corona outbreak shitstorm we were forced to work from home. I asked him a couple of questions that were work related but then one thing led to another and we started chatting about other things too. One thing led to another, I confessed how strong my feelings are for him again and he said that he feels the same.

Before the whole lockdown thing that took over the UK, we planned a sleepover at his place. I went one day after work and we had our first kiss in his car. It was amazing to see what hugging and kissing this person felt like after such a long time. I haven‚Äôt felt like this before with anyone so it was an actual surprise to see how much I liked him.

Fast forward to 5 minutes of making out, we started taking off our clothes and things started being more intense. Now, I knew this person hasn‚Äôt had a relationship since he was at university which was 12??? Years ago and he‚Äôs told me he hasn‚Äôt done anything sexual since then either so I took things as slowly as I could since we were both horny. We had sex but I could see a sadness in his eyes as soon as it started. We talked about it not lasting a long time prior to it I had no issues with that.

After it happened, we went to order something to eat and maybe watch a movie. Things started getting heated again and I tried giving him some oral sex. He turned his head to the side while the whole thing was happening so I stopped and I asked him what‚Äôs wrong. I tried asking lots of questions and at some point I asked him ‚Äúwas earlier your first time?‚Äù. He said yes. I felt so bad in that moment, mostly because maybe I wasn‚Äôt as gentle as you should be with someone on their first time, maybe I wasn‚Äôt paying enough attention to pleasing him, maybe I made him very uncomfortable with how everything felt. I felt terrible. He later on confessed that he also has a porn addiction. It would have explained all the lost erections that happened during us getting more intimate.

Now, I think I am in love with this man. Like deeply, crazy in love. He told me that he expected to be alone forever and that nobody could fall in love with him, yet, to quote ‚ÄúI gave him a chance like nobody did and I pursued him like nobody did‚Äù. My friends tell me not to get involved in this since they say that he seems to have issues, but I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with someone being extremely introverted, shy, nerdy and recluse. I really like this man, I like how he makes me feel, I like how it feels to hug him and kiss him and I like everything about him. I don‚Äôt know how to act around him from now on since I have a very high sex drive and I get turned on instantly and all I want to do is instantly have sex. Any tips on how to approach this from now on?",1,1585209344,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fp7lw5/i23f_took_my_crushes33m_virginity_without_knowing/,AskMen,1

fp5r8m,anonymoustarzan,I'm having a very hard time letting go of wanting a Tinder/Hookup/Player phase. Who hasn't really had it and was able to move on? I need help please.,"**I know this is long, but I would sincerely appreciate whoever reads this and replies. Just please be compassionate and withhold hurtful remarks.** 

I'm a 27M and the Tinder/Hookup/Player phase has never happened for me and I'm really upset about it. I'm also currently having to choose between giving up on ever making it happen, and therefore being able to choose the girl of my dreams, or start a relationship with a girl who's quite special but doesn't check all the boxes. 

We met a year ago , we dated on/off for 6.5 months, broke off for good for 3.5 months, hooked up twice around new years, broke off 2 months, and surprisingly we got in touch again a week ago. Each breakup was less painful, but yesterday we talked and pretty much broke off again and I sobbed myself to sleep. The last time I cried like that was a year ago.  

I like her. To the point that sometimes I'm with her and I want to tell her that I love her, but I'm afraid that I don't really mean it. I've had this urge to tell her that I loved her from around 2 - 3 weeks into dating her. I remember the moment, and she said that it's that same moment that she developed feelings for me too.  I'm afraid I don't really mean those words because what if it's just ""in the moment horniness""?  Although she's physically attractive and I know for a fact that people would line up for her given not just her physical attractiveness but her attractive confident social presence - she's not my dream girl in terms of attractiveness, body type, etc. There's been many times where I just didn't feel attracted to her at all.

With the whole physical attractiveness thing - I don't even know if the ideal body type in my mind is the one I'll find attractive and enjoyable in real life. I just want to at least experience it. I want to experience every kind of woman that I feel attracted to and figure out what I really truly want and what I can put aside (this is why I've wanted to have hookups, fwb, fuck buddies - I don't want to lead anyone on)

Frankly, I feel like I don't have a right to complain though given that she's pretty much the most attractive girl I've dated. And I'm just not getting attention from ""my type"" or any woman I find attractive during in-person interactions. But I don't want to settle. There's a voice in my head telling me to not settle, but there's also a voice telling me that she's an amazing person, and I haven't found anyone better, it also says "" ever since you didn't want to be exclusive 10 months ago, you've got 1 app match which turned into a date, which turned out to be someone pregnant - this is an amazing person that you shouldn't let go of""

Physical attractiveness aside - She's also not totally my dream girl in terms of compatibility and chemistry, but i've never met someone any more compatible. We're like 80% compatible. What we're not compatible on : She has a young child which she has 50/50 custody of = a certain lifestyle which won't be changing, and that I'm not confident I want for myself (but that I've gotten more comfortable with) and when we've butt heads, it was really frustrating since we both want to be right, and we sometimes don't agree on the language/vocabulary to use to explain and describe something. She's also 12 years older than me and I'm scared that my physical attractiveness to her will be a bigger deal sooner rather than later. Also, as much as I like supporting her, her insecurities, and indecision sometimes turn me off. 

What works about us? We have very similar very analytical , over-think-ish minds and we've both never met anyone else with that in common and it's lead to us being able to be quite supportive of eachother. I've felt seen and heard for once and it feels really good. It's been super painful whenever I've let go of her. I feel confident that we can do amazing things together, that we can support each-other to amazing levels. That aside - our banter chemistry is amazing. Our sexual chemistry is pretty good and feels like it can only get better, especially since we both have a strong desire to improve as people and actively look for resources to help us. We're both in the same professional industry and that's important for both of us as it's a core value.   


Honestly, I think I love her, and what love means to me is that I admire her best qualities and that I care enough about her that I want to support her in her growth as an individual. I also love what she does for me, which is make me feel important, attractive, sexy, and powerful. 

So I don't know what to do. She doesn't want to work on our relationship unless it's going towards a partnership. I want to have any kind of connection with her, but I don't want to work towards a partnership. Maybe a partnership for us is in the future. Essentially - I feel like I want to keep her around until or if I find someone better. Is that wrong, or is that what everyone pretty much does - but doesn't realize they're doing it and don't state it bluntly to themselves or others?

Honestly, I really want to fuck more women, date more, I want to feel powerful and capable of attracting any woman that I want and being able to choose who I want to partner with. I want to try out every body-type. I want to be with someone who I feel like is more compatible from the start. With her, I feel like we have to work on it and change ourselves quite a bit. That's a bet that a lot of people make that I'm not totally comfortable making - but then I wonder - isn't that really the realistic choice? I battle in my head between the idea of ""becoming more compatible by building together the castle which is the connection"" and ""you shouldn't get into a relationship wanting someone to change"".

With her, I feel like she's chosen me and that I have no other choice but to choose her. Sure, I've flirted with people in-person which I found attractive and was disappointed in the convo/lack of chemistry/lack of receptivity. But that doesn't feel like I'm choosing her. While we haven't been dating, she's briefly dated and fucked 2 other guys. She still dating one of them (I didn't get more details on it but I know that he's aware of me). I really don't like that in one year she's slept with more guys than I've slept with in my whole life. It's demoralizing. I'm ashamed. I'm embarrassed. She doesn't know this. 

Most of all, I feel weak. I've tried so many different things to be more successful on dating apps over the years. I don't get attention from women in-person. Like fuck, how can a woman like ""that"" flirt with me and initiate the whole relationship and I can't get any other woman interested in me. 0 women. Not even women I find unattractive are liking me on dating apps (except on extremely rare occasions) WTF. 

I feel incapable of having the experiences that I want and feel like I need to be happy and fulfilled to the fullest. I'm extremely jealous of guys that are just super attractive and have never had to worry about dating, and could focus on other areas of their life because this just comes easy. It's not fair. My focus on my dating life has impacted my growth in other areas - but fuck, life is more about relationships than it is about money. 

It's almost that life just isn't worth living if I can't get what I want. I don't want to settle but I feel forced into it. But it's not like what I'd be settling into is bad, she's a great person. I don't know what to do. I've done so much reading and writing and talking and reflecting and putting myself out there to relieve this FOMO, embarrassment, hope, and gain more understanding. There's so much more I can add to what I've done. 

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? What have you done?   


TLDR ; Honestly, I don't want any TLDR responses. It's important to me that if you reply, that you read the whole thing. That will help me feel a bit more heard and understood. I didn't put a lot of effort into writing this for no reason. Thank you.",0,1585199528,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fp5r8m/im_having_a_very_hard_time_letting_go_of_wanting/,AskMen,1

Anyway, my sister often volunteered to get mails from mailbox outside of the house. She does this because she want to be the first to tell my parents that our school sent letter probably about suspension from bus or school for something I tried to hide from my parents. 

So, one day outside on Saturday morning, I rode my bicycle and I saw a garter snake on ground. It was small one-footer pencil thin snake. I picked up the snake into one of cargo pockets in my pant and rode back to home for lunch. As I was nearing to home, I took snake out and placed into our empty mailbox. I ran into house and I looked through window for mail to arrive. My sister saw me and she became suspicious. She shouted to mom that she's getting mail and ran toward to our mailbox. I watched through window with huge smile the snake jumped into her romper and it crawled out through one of her legs.

I have always done my absolute best to support her and our children they have always been my #1 priority. She left this morning and I have been mourning all day.

I feel like a part of me has died I am trying my best to remain sober as I know alcohol will only make this worse for me. I am terrified  to tell our children as I know they would immediately hate her and I can't imagine them rejecting her or not wanting her in their lives. I know my our children well enough to know they would flip out.

fp2v0d,Cyanide_Revolver,How would you forgive yourself for hurting someone?,"My ex and I broke up a month and a half ago (we were together two months) and after trying to go about seeing each other again it just didn't work out (this was about 3ish weeks ago now). There were a few things that happened after the breakup (and upon self-reflection and thinking over the relationship) that made me change opinion on her, and I felt confused about how I felt. On Saturday she messaged me saying she loved me. At that time I was stressed about other things, was confused about where my head was and said I felt the same without knowing if I felt that way. I ended that conversation straight after saying it wasn't a good time to talk about something like that becuase my head wasn't in the right place, and she was understanding.

The next day we messaged and she was understanding that I didn't want to get back into a relationship again, however I didn't explain how I felt. She messaged me about something random today and it gave me the impression she was still trying to get me back, or was at least waitng for me in some way. It made me feel guilty for basically lying about saying how I felt on Saturday, so I messaged her saying how I really did feel with an apology. I knew it would be hurtful but I needed to tell her and have some closure.


Turns out she wasn't ""waiting"" for me in any kind of way and was messaging me purely as a friend and I got the wrong idea (she was quite bitchy about it, which I could understand as she'd be upset). I apolgised for the whole thing and she tried to act like it was cool but added she was ""disappointed"" because she didn't expect that behaviour from me. We're not on speaking terms now. On one hand I'm glad because I now have closure on the relationship to an extent and I got it off my chest, but on the other hand I know she's hurt and upset.

fp21li,cjalta,How do you get your sex drive back?,"My sex drive is gone, i dont wake up with morning erections, and i dont get aroused when seeing beautiful woman on the internet. I dont get random erections throughout the day like i did a few months ago. I even dont masturbate like that anymore because i am just not turned on.

I am able to have sex and finish however, but when i was with this woman it just felt more like a chore than anything, and it takes a bit to get aroused when before a girl can touch my leg and ill get an instant stiffy. This was not the case a few months ago though, I always wanted to have sex, masturbate, talk to different girls but now its like i wana be alone. 

Things i think that happen that might cause this.

1. I had an unexplained epididymis in my left testie that lasted for months im talking about from sept up until feb, i was in lots of pain everyday, and constantly looked my symptoms up which led me to overthink and cause anxiety.

2. I have been sitting like a lot for hours while standing sometimes, i have to work on a comp but this was never a problem before. 

3. I dont exercise or eat that well, i exercise when i can and only recently started eating better while taking supplements just to be a bit more healthy. 

4. My gf and i broke up about 2 months ago now we were together 5 years, now before you say its this and im jus sad. Im really not i am happy i have my own space, a new job, saved money. Maybe just a lil sad but we have broken up before and i never exerpinced a no sex drive after the break up.

This whole things makes me feel weird, i am used to waking up with a morning erection and just feeling good and confident. I have been to the doctors multiple times and urologist were they did ultra sounds of my testis, and ct scan of abdomen, and blood work and testosterone level checks twice now which stayed between 630-800. Everything came back completely normal and i am as the doc said completely healthy 26 year old. What should i do now?

fozgv8,Calm_Buyer,"Men, how do we avoid dressing like our dads as we get older?","Hey guys,

I'm in my early 30s, and I find myself gravitating towards clothes that are stylish but still brands that my dad buys that I have avoided in my teens and 20s. I'll find myself looking for more comfortable clothes that are also durable (just like he does). I was out shopping for some shoes and legitimately stopped at the same white tennis shoes that he has worn for years and thought maybe they were worth getting.

The last time I was shopping for jeans, I unconsciously thought the type of blue jeans he normally wears seem like a good option, even things like the same 12 pack of socks or what's worse, considering buying the same brand of briefs as him instead of my usual boxers because he once told me ""you won't wear boxers for forever"" (maybe he was right about that), or even using the same worn out wallet until it falls apart.

He's not a bad dresser by any means, but as I get older I find the same style that I used to wear not appealing anymore, and maybe just spending so much time with him that his style has worn off on me. I would tell him this, but I know he'd never let me live it down.

I guess, is it normal to start eventually dressing like our dads? Anything you've started wearing that your dad also does? Is that a good thing? Any tips to deal with it?Men.",51,1585174537,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fozgv8/men_how_do_we_avoid_dressing_like_our_dads_as_we/,AskMen,1

foyp7l,PancitCanton243,"This quarantine stuff is challenging my relationship and I don't really know what to do, can I get some advice?","Me and this girl have are in what one can call a ""soft"" relationship. We both know each other's feelings and are really close, but we aren't dating because we respect our parents too much. I guess you could say we are pretty ""lovey-dovey"" in how we act, texting each other a lot, calling every night etc. But lately everything had been getting really awkward. When we call there's just this awkward silence and conversations seem really dry. 

Yes, I have 0 experience with females and we are both pretty young and new to relationship stuff. We have talked about our situation and decided to take a break from calling because it just became too awkward. The problem is now I've started to get this weird feeling every time I think of her, like this feeling of being annoyed and I feel like every time we talk I just put on a mask and be really fake. I want to talk to her more and have more conversations but it just doesn't feel natural and I don't feel like I am getting anything out of it in a sense. 

I know many people will probably say like ""first loves will never last"" and stuff but I just like this girl too much and if there is something I can do about this situation I would really like to try. I am also not someone who can think of themselves highly, I'm very unconfident and if there's a problem I always try to blame it on me.

foxte3,YouSoGetMe,"If you're menstrual friendly, would you use a period app that tells you how your wife is feeling each day?","Mods: please delete if this is unsuitable, I followed the guidelines.

So many years ago, when I was researching to find causes of the stomach cancer that ultimately took my wife‚Äôs life, I found out a lot about the menstrual cycle and I started to learn how her cycle was making her feel each day. Because she could not walk or do much and I was depressed as I watched her slowly die and I had no power to stop it, I made a spreadsheet that told me what I could do to help her each day ‚Äì without having to be asked, and without having to ask her. I wanted to give her love and happiness for as long as she could receive it.

Now, 20+ years later a lot of people came together and made this into an app for women, and the info is written by women. 

However, because we are in lockdown, I‚Äôm finding this this type of info becomes necessary to give an extra layer of understanding between couples who are around each other all day, so I want to ask if men in relationships would like to know this too. 

There is a page or more of info for every day of the cycle, telling what to do for PMS, body pains, when it might be better to just to listen instead of providing solutions, when her libido may get lower and it becomes harder to orgasm. When knowing this, you can take the pressure off of achieving this, and have more fun, exploration and sharing .. and other things. 

To show you some example info for key days:

Day 1 (start of period)

* For most women, the start of the period also brings feelings of relief and de-stress. One reason is because the body is now releasing more estrogen which increases serotonin which helps her feel better. But right now she's at the start of her gradual extra-energy build-up while also feeling the impact of low iron. At this point, her thinking is about handling everything in her day with preference to taking care of her body. She may have low energy, physical pain and feel slow but her mind also has a new spark and energy to it. Meditation is helpful for both her mind and body today and she's very intuitive.   ... and continues with a page or more of info.

Day 14 (ovulation day)

* She may be more motherly towards you and family, wanting to create a more supportive environment while at the same time wanting to go out and connect with people. Her intelligence quota is excellent today and that's a boost to aid her in undergoing mentally and verbally-challenging activities like project presentations, job interviews, and debates in the morning or before lunch time as these are the best thinking-hours ... and continues with a page or more of info.

Day 28 (before next cycle)

* A day where it's fine if she didn't move around or do much. She might feel a mix of being a little sad, a little amorous, and would want to get right to the point in most discussions. Her cycle starts tomorrow and she might have that flu feeling. She may feel depressed a little but at the same time her speed of understanding and planning is very high. Intimacy may be high on her mind and she'll be looking at you more sensually, wanting an exciting and fun-loving time without any heavy emotional baggage. However her body feels a little heavy and bloated and she might feel she wants intimacy and at the same time, she isn't feeling so good or could be stomping around the house because she wants you to know but she doesn't want to tell you  ... and continues with a page or more of info.

The app tells when to be careful for unintended pregnancy and gives daily info for Feeling, Body, Diet and Intimacy. The info for men was prepared a long time ago (and approved by women) and there's a few things to do to make the app work for men, but before I do it, I'd like to ask:

* The app would be free, but is it ok that you to watch a short video or something to use it?

* Would you need to have approval from your SO before you use it? I'd setup a couples app with a 'connector' from your SO to give the right cycle data (start date, length, duration)?

* or you'd prefer not to know how she feels or what to do about it, and I should just can the idea.

fov7te,blackgold12,Where Do You All Meet Women Besides Bars?,"Hi All,

I was wondering where you all usually go to meet women as a late-20/early-30 male? I moved to a new city for my job, don't really know anybody, and am finding it really hard to meet women. I look terrible in pictures, so online dating is unfortunately a no go for me. The other part that sucks is I work in consulting where I and everybody else is constantly out of town for most of the work week. As such, I don't know any of my coworkers in my office because nobody comes in on Fridays, so I don't even have that as a base to meet people.

I have a great job, am in shape, and am not autistic, so I feel like this shouldn't be as hard as it has been. I mostly just need to find activities, but I'm not really sure what to do since I relied on friends in my hometown/coworkers to make friends at my old job. Bars are fine and all, but I'm kind of over partying/binge drinking at this stage of my life, plus I hate going alone.

I decided to ask him out directly to give him the chance to give me the ""I didn't feel a connection"" thing, but instead he agreed and asked me what place I had in mind. I told him, he responded the next day saying that sounded good. I asked him if he was free on a specific day, and ghosted (it's been two days without a response now).

foosuf,Cartoons4adults,Have you ever had a rage fueled moment caused by your imagination?,"And I mean RAGE, adrenaline pumping, you feel invincible, capable of killing type rage. 

I was watching this video on Facebook of a poor beagle being mauled to death by a Rottweiler or pit bull type dog in an upper class residential area on a busy street. This poor beagle was letting out these horrific pain filled yelps, the aggressive dog had the beagle's ear in it's jaws and the people around them were FUCKING USELESS. Admittedly, the people trying to intervene were elderly, but there were younger adult men around too. What really set me off was when the police arrived. Naturally you'd think, okay the police are here they'll take care of this. Nope. The incompetence was unbearable. The police officer moved the aggressive dog in a way where it was able to get a hold of the beagles throat and this poor thing was yelping for its life under a death grip as the aggressive dog started shaking for the kill. There were people pleading to the officers to kill the dog, and I was watching in complete disbelief I started to get angry, ""KILL THAT FUCKING DOG"" I angrily muttered to myself. Eventually the dog let go and ran off to it's yard behind a fence. By the end of the video the beagle was in terrible condition, but seemed alive. There was blood all over the ground, and it was brutal. 

The incompetence of the people around was the catalyst that drove me to my mad reaction. I was so unbelievably angry I started to think about what if something like that happened when I was walking my dog or when she was out on the yard. I love my dog, she's this elderly small thing and I would protect her ferociously. I started to envision this fabricated scenario in which she was in the jaws of death of some fucking maniac dog and I completely fucking lost it. My body went into fight mode and for that moment everything was real. My muscles were tense and swole, adrenaline surged through my body, the rage and fury filled my head, and I started punching as hard and as fast as I could with one goal in mind, kill this fucking beast. I fell to the ground on my knees and I started punching and bashing towards the ground, my face altered by the wrath that had overtaken me. After I felt like ""enough"" had been done I began to calm down. Then I started processing what had just happened to me.

I think that human strength is underrated and that rage and adrenaline make people capable of very scary things, and I feel like I experienced a sense of that. For that moment I felt like killing was something I was capable of, and I didn't like it, but it didn't feel senseless. It had a purpose, I feel, to defend. The thought of something like that happening to my own dog was too much, especially when you consider the unknown that comes with each day and the fact that in reality anything can happen. Fucking wanted to vent this too.",1,1585136111,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/foosuf/have_you_ever_had_a_rage_fueled_moment_caused_by/,AskMen,1

fon81e,sweetsweetnothingg,Can y‚Äôall have a FWB for over a year and not catch any feelings?,"I (25) was in a casual relationship with a guy (24) for over a year. We would hangout once or twice a week. Sex is beyond amazing, we both were not very experienced so this came as a surprise for both of us. We would stay over at each other‚Äôs places every time and talk. Although we were casual he only had sex with one other girl one time when he heard I went on a date only because I heard he was checking out a dating app. We talked about it and went back to ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Now after a year he is told me he wants to sleep with another girl but not end us because he knows the connection we have. I was his fourth and he was my third. Then he said he wanted to end us because the girl wouldn‚Äôt sleep with him if he had something with me. His choice is clear here. I said I had feelings and we ended it. He always thought I was more mature than him and once mentioned to a common friend that he thought I would eventually leave him if we committed. I am very surprised he was able to just move on so fast after so long together. I know I did agree to casual so that‚Äôs on me for accepting that, but I was wondering if this happens often?

fom55x,OnMyWay21,"Guys, would this raise your alarms with your GF?","I've been dating this very lovely girl for some time now. She is pretty, and smart, and I'm happy with her... that being said, we have bumped heads on the topic of other guys a few times now. 

I'm looking for 2 perspectives here (maybe 3). One, is from my perspective. If you were in my shoes would it bother you and how much. Two, is from the other guys perspective. Three, is from her perspective. 

Okay. So we just spent a week together straight at her place. Covid and all. Everyone is on lock down. I had to leave because my dog needed some care and I wanted to check on my mother etc. I sent her a few texts with sparse responses and finally called her at the end of the night just to say goodnight and talk a little about her day. Now I spam call her a bit because I think maybe she is just doing dishes or something. You know. How busy can she be this late in the night and with social distancing. She doesn't pick up. Eventually she pics up and she is outside from the sounds of it. That's a little surprising. 

As it turns out, her coworker, (I'll call him David) has invited her over to play new Animal crossing game on switch. Now there are a couple things that peeved me from the get go. 

A) We've kind of been locked up for a week taking serious measures to stay germ free. Now she goes over to her co-workers house where it's him, and his roommate, and there was another person visiting before. People are playing switch, sharing controllers. Basically whatever germ free environment we had, it's been forsaken. Also her place of work has had multiple cases of Corona and even one person died. It's a big place, but idk if hanging out with coworkers is the best right now. Like let's weight those priorities. 

B) She was so hard to reach because she's been hanging out at this dude's house. I didn't know she was there at all. She later told me that when I was spam calling her (maybe like 6 times in the row, and again because I thought she was home), the guy asked her if she wanted to answer the phone and she said no, basically ignoring me. She said it was because she was in the middle of the game than and didn't want to talk on the phone in front of others, but it's weird to me when GF avoids talking to their SO in front of another guy. It doesn't have to be a whole conversation. Just pick up, say you're busy and will call back in a few and hang up.

C) I sorta know this guy from some of her work stories. Now he doesn't sound like a bad guy, but her stories always sound just a little more than friendly. The few I've heard was him asking her to have lunch with him (only him) and there was other instances like inverting himself into this g that she cares about (blood donation). There were more. I don't remember. All of those are JUST innocent enough where you don't really can say either way, but I did have a sense he was interested in her. Maybe just enough to maintain work relationship, but there was some flirting IMO. Nothing huge. It happens. I let it go. 
So in the span of this conversation I also found out they have been casually texting each other for the last few weeks. So really skirting that line in my book. 

Anyway. Here is another thing about my GF. She does not mention having a BF. For privacy reasons according to her. 

Okay. So how fishy it looks from my end fellas? 

Now I didn't do a great job of explaining her side. I feel like I would have to describe way too much of her. She is particular on the way she does things. What I described is not out of the realm of norm for her. The point of this post is not to catch her in a lie or anything like that. It's simply to see how other guys would view/handle this.

Lastly, what if you were David? A cute girl comes over in the middle of pandamic to play switch with you the second you mention anything. She never brings up a boyfriend. Texts you all throughout week.

Would you not think she is leading him on even if she doesn't have any malicious intentions?",1,1585121168,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fom55x/guys_would_this_raise_your_alarms_with_your_gf/,AskMen,1

fokxyi,aaggww,Boyfriend's Boner,"I've been with my boyfriend for about a year. Last week, when we were talking about a famous model that I've vocally been jealous of in the past, he mentioned that he got a boner from looking at photos of her (this model is an Instagram star who only posts half-naked pictures of herself). Immediately I felt hurt and insecure.

 I know it's just a celebrity crush, but now I'm constantly comparing myself to her. She's a beautiful model with a seemingly perfect body. I know I'm nothing in comparison. 

This isnt about love at all, I know my boyfriend loves me very much. This is about his sexual attraction to me. I know he finds me attractive, but I cant help but wonder if he wishes I looked more like her. Sometimes when I look at him I just think about him being attracted to someone else. Even if it's someone he never has a chance of being with, I know that he would probably rather have sex with her instead of me. 

When I talk about it with him, he just doesnt understand. I dont blame him for feeling attracted to her. It's not his fault and I know he cant control if he gets a boner for someone else. But I still feel hurt and upset. I know I'm probably an idiot for being so affected by this, but I cant control my feelings. I cant stop being upset about it.

A few days ago, he liked one of my post on FB. And that‚Äôs how I remember how much an assh*le I was. So I just wanted to apologize to him. 

The thing is, I don‚Äôt know how to start to not make him feel like I‚Äôm asking for his forgiveness or anything.

During his press briefings this week, he has repeatedly used it to justify why we need to focus on the economy more than the virus. 

If we can show scenarios of people doing everything right and according to the plan, but still catching the virus (and thereby risking death), we can make a logical argument to our governors on why we must shut down now so we recover sooner. 

The more scenarios we can come up with, the more times we can show how doing everything right still risks people‚Äôs lives and the lives of others. If do everything right and still catch the virus, and go home to my old parents who never leave the house (hypothetically), I not only caught the virus by doing everything in the plan but I also spread it to others who were also doing everything right.

He does amazing stuff for me but something I can‚Äôt shake is his inability to be physically present. 

So he brought up moving in together but due to circumstances, I proposed an option of one week at his place and one week at mine. Seemed to go fine but haven‚Äôt heard anything since. 

I brought it up about 3 weeks ago and he said he would think about it. Brought it up last week and he said he hasn‚Äôt had time to think about it and sort out details...I haven‚Äôt bothered him about it since.

Also, with us working from home...I brought up possibly working from home together which he said said not now but maybe soon enough...haven‚Äôt heard anything about it.

I had a mental breakdown yesterday and was hoping he would come over to help me but we have a standing date weekly and all he said was, I can‚Äôt wait to see you tomorrow to hug you...

He‚Äôs an introvert and I know he needs space but it has me worried because if there is a real future...he‚Äôs going to have to live with me at some point.

Thankfully, I've been able to get over these things and prove I'm better than them (I still experience them, of course, but I'm lucky enough to know that I have control and capability to get through them). One recurring thought I have, though, is that I'm a nuisance to the people around me. I consider myself an ambivert, who has a good number of friends, a few of which I text on a regular basis (since we kinda can't see eachother because of social distancing and quarentine atm). I know my friends like me, but I feel like I get overbearing and clingy when I get close to people. I ask them if this is so, and they usually say no, so I continue talking on and on (because I like to talk to friends), but realize my talking on and on is probably annoying, and that I probably get rather obnoxious. Most of my friends are very nice, so I feel like even if I ask them if I'm being a nuisance when I am, they'll say no, and if that convinces me then I'll start to doubt myself once I start going on and on again.

fogkyv,cherryx_,What more can I do to mend my relationship/marriage?,"Hey, guys. 

I hope it‚Äôs okay to post this here. I guess I‚Äôd just like to see what other men think/have to say. 

I [23F] have been married to my husband for 3 years, and right now, I‚Äôm not sure if a single year with him has been good. We also have two small babies together.

He‚Äôs 29. For the past 2 years, he‚Äôs been very emotionally, verbally, and mentally abusive. It‚Äôs become so horrible over the past year. He‚Äôs called me really awful stuff and has said really horrible things to me (fuck you, psychotic, stupid, dumb, you sounds insecure, unstable, pathetic bitch, stupid bitch, why are you crying- after he called me a bitch for like the 5th time....) 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I can‚Äôt ever express my concerns with him because he gets so upset, annoyed and defensive. Everything that I say will go in one year and out the other. He‚Äôs just annoyed the entire time in talking. He‚Äôll say things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to be lectured. You‚Äôre not my mom.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you done?‚Äù And then just walks away. 

I‚Äôm a SAHM and run a very busy schedule with our little ones. I also do everything around the house.. cooking, cleaning, laundry, organizing, etc.. (which I don‚Äôt mind), but he has it really ‚Äúeasy‚Äù. He plays video games excessively, and it‚Äôs become terrible. The moment he gets home, he grabs his controller and plays all day and is in the mic. If I mention it, he gets so freaking upset. 

I feel beyond defeated. I‚Äôve been to therapy (for myself and for the relationship) and I‚Äôve tried to encourage him to come but he‚Äôs refused to, because it‚Äôs ‚Äústupid‚Äù. I even made sure to get a male counselor, because I thought he‚Äôd be more receptive to the opinions of someone he‚Äôd consider a peer. 

I‚Äôm just sad and always wonder what it‚Äôd be like to be in a loving and respectful relationship with a man who actually cares and loves me wholeheartedly, and can prioritize and balance things in his life. 

Yet, he tells me he loves me, but I‚Äôm not so sure that‚Äôs true. I feel like he‚Äôs shown me everything that love isn‚Äôt.",1,1585095747,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fogkyv/what_more_can_i_do_to_mend_my_relationshipmarriage/,AskMen,1

fofjd1,ChasingShadowsXii,How to approach cancelling my gym membership,"Hi,

I train BJJ at a small local gym which was only set up about 6 months before the coronavirus situation which has forced them to close.

The gym is very small and was running at a loss while trying to build numbers. Like they struggle to pay rent while open purely because they're new and split from another martial arts club. 

I pay $80 per month for the membership which is reasonable but if I won't be getting anything for that money during the closure which could be 6 or 12 months.

I feel bad about just cancelling the membership because the gym is struggling and they'll be getting no support to stay open from the government.

By her own admission, I'm her type and our personalities match. The thing is, one day while we were talking I said some things that I never should have said and was essentially quite mean/offensive to her. I apologized to her a million times (genuinely), took like a day for her to start talking to me again. While we are now on somewhat good terms and are talking normally again, I still feel so much guilt over what I did. She is an incredibly innocent and sweet person, and I basically implied that she was a bitch/slut (which wasn't really my intention) but it came out that way and I cannot absolve myself of any blame, and obviously she got pissed off and rightly.

fod9at,ifinkufreeky123,"Me (26 y/o) want to move back to my home country, boyfriend doesnt know what he wants.","Hi all,

I want to move back to the Netherlands, my english boyfriend (3,5 years together) does not know what he wants. He lives here since the age of 10, now he is 29. And ive been living here 3 years now and have family here. 

I want to go back because here i cant get a job i like  and i cant find my happiness. I miss my best friend, sisters and the Dutch lifestyle. And having more job and study possibilities. 

I will leave my parents and brother behind here, also my boyfriend his mom. Im not sure yet, since i want my boyfriend to come with me..

But he is not a man of change, he never goes out. Doesn't see friends, has a good job and enjoys coming home. Me on the other hand speak and meet my parents alot. But i really miss the social side of living in holland. Visiting friends, or my sister. Or meet new friends on the job. 

Plus in Holland he will be able to get a job aswell.. and for him (always at home after work or in the weekends) there will not change alot except he leaves his mom and comfort zone of where he grew up behind. Plus its colder. 

We bought an appartment together and we could easily rent this out. Everytime i ask him if he already knows if he wants to come with me he says i dont know... 

I just wanna start somewhere new with just him and hopefully start a family once settled. Unfortunately we had a lot of bad luck here.. and even know i think its sad to leave my family here behind. I dont think ill ever be happy here..  

He is not good in having conversation i literally have to ask all the time to get an answer out of him. If he says yes i would start a financial saving plan and we could start planning towards it. The thought of it makes me excited (and scared)

fo9v6j,Throwthisawaychest,"How would I raise a boy who knows that it‚Äôs okay to cry, without it affecting him negatively in other ways?","I‚Äôm always seeing people say that you should raise your boys to be sensitive. That not having the ability to cry makes it very hard to deal with your emotions, etc. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard it all already, and know from experience. I don‚Äôt have any children but I‚Äôd like to be prepared. 

&amp;#x200B;

First I‚Äôd like to know what you‚Äôd define as sensitive? Is it crying during an argument? Crying during a sad movie? Just having the ability to cry over anything without it having to be extreme (e.g. a parent‚Äòs death)? What would you define as ***too*** sensitive? 

&amp;#x200B;

What I‚Äôd also like to know is how do you deal with the negative side effects of a boy being sensitive? For example, I have a little brother. He‚Äôs 9 years old and I let him know that‚Äôs it‚Äôs okay to cry... until he‚Äôs around his friends/cousins and it‚Äôs just like dude shut the fuck up this is how you‚Äôre gonna get bullied. His friends are the same age so I‚Äôm sure they all cry too but what happens when he‚Äôs 12? 14? Can you imagine two 14 year old boys arguing, and then one of them bursting into tears over *words*? His life would be over.   


Another thing is that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met a woman who‚Äòs seen a man cry and thought of it as anything but negative. ‚ÄúDisgust‚Äù is the word I‚Äôd use. Maybe I just have bad experiences with women but no matter how many times women ask to see your ‚Äúsensitive side‚Äù, or complain that you‚Äôre a ‚Äúrobot who never shows emotion‚Äù, they always regret it once you actually cry in front of them. I never cry but I‚Äôve spoken to a lot of guys and have even seen it firsthand a couple if times, and it‚Äôs never worked out well - I‚Äôm sure 99% of men reading this can attest to that fact. The only time it does is if it‚Äôs a very long term relationship, and even then it‚Äôs 50/50 or she‚Äôs just not admitting how she actually feels. It‚Äôs like when women cry, it‚Äôs normal and men‚Äôs instinct is to protect. With women, seeing a man cry is a really foreign concept to them and I think that by seeing him cry, they themselves feel vulnerable. Also, the fact that crying isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúmasculine‚Äú and so it‚Äôs unattractive in that way, too. 

  
How do I raise my son to know that having emotions is fine, when at the same time having emotions is going to negatively impact him in pretty much every encounter he has during his life? I‚Äôm sure that properly processing your emotions is amazing for dealing with things like mental health, and is essential for functioning as a person, but as a man I‚Äôd argue that there are even more negatives that don‚Äôt ever seem to be talked about. By this I mean it‚Äôs always just people throwing our statements like ‚Äúteach your son to be sensitive‚Äù, and ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay to cry‚Äù, and no one ever disagrees, or talks about the nuances of it all.",17,1585073325,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fo9v6j/how_would_i_raise_a_boy_who_knows_that_its_okay/,AskMen,1

fo7yij,30yoMan,"Sexual Analogies, do other men think this way? Do you have any analogies you use to explain what sex is like for men and the effect it can have?","In the fact that everyone is different, and it is difficult for people to understand concepts that they themselves do not experience. I often find myself trying to come up with analogies or comparisons in effort to help explain to people the way my mind works. Particularly for sexual concepts. I was wondering if other men try and use analogies to help explain how our minds work and if so, some you may have used that helped explain it to others?

I have 2 examples from recently. I was explaining to a woman why sex/sexual connection is, in a sense, a NEED for me.

1: ""Imagine every time we have sex, you give me a rose. Healthy, bendable, resilient, and standing tall. It can stand the weather, the heat, and the cold.
But as time goes on, it starts to dry out. It starts to whilt. The pedals start to fall and the stalk becomes rigid. And the more time passes, the easier it breaks.
But every time we have sex, you give me a new rose, and I am once again able to weather the storms with poise and resilience.""

Or an analogy as to why blowjobs are so great.

2: ""In terms of overall pleasure, It's like this. Handjobs are a 100... Sex is a 300. Kinks/Fantasies are a 500. But Blowjobs are unique. A blowjob starts as a 100. But every 1 second you use your mouth is a +1... So 4 minutes of mouth is better than sex. 8 minutes of mouth is better than a fantasy.
Now, Of course there are variables based on positions and each persons specific kinks. But whether you're just starting with your mouth, or using it throughout the endeavor. 1 second is a +1.""

Do these resonate with any other men, or do you have any other methods of explaining what sex is like for you to other people?",5,1585067122,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fo7yij/sexual_analogies_do_other_men_think_this_way_do/,AskMen,1

I have a lot of friends, but I've known them all since childhood (small community) and don't really feel romantically about any of them.

Back in B.C (you know.. before covid19) I was doing better than ever before in the social aspect of my life. I got a job, started working out and was thinking of getting into rock climbing or some other social sport.

Well, of course that's all gone to shit as of February. I'm socially distanced, just like I always used to be, and I'm wondering how I'll manage to keep making progress if I'm alone at home

fo5fcs,peachmuffin143,"Hi, I need advice about communication in relationship","It's my first time posting here and I've vented this out on other sub but i want to see some of your guys opinions about the circumstances I'm in rn. So I'm in a relationship with my boyfriend for 1yr++ now.

Well... Not sure if I'm just being needy or anything. But well yeah honeymoon phase ended a long time ago. But we still have a good time together. At least that's what I was thinking. I'm at another state to study and he's working.

Okay I'm sorry guys if this sounds gibberish. Idk what to point out rn. I'm okay for a few days but then when I decided to ask for opinions, my mind gone blank. So my bf don't call much. We chat but I don't feel like if this past few days. I feel neglected. On December last year I went through some serious stuffs and so I need someone to listen. I called him. Then he said""Is it important? I'm playing games rn. I'll call you later. "" I was bawling at that time but hearing him say that makes my heart sinks. I stopped crying and everything feels numb. But I just brushed it off. Until a few months goes by he would say things like"" why do you like calling so much? "","" I'm playing games"" etc etc. Now... We're on LDR. And I can count just how much he calls. In an instance, we gone through 3 months without calling. The most he would call is about twice a month. I was so happy when he called bcs I know I would have to wait for another month for him to call. I didn't want to call because I don't want to bother him. Well.. I have to admit it was very one sided. The worst thing isn't how frequent he calls. But just how much he cares about me.

Now I just let it be. If he calls then he will, if otherwise then I just battle my own feelings not to initiate. It would be insincere of him to call me up if I have to remind him again and again. 

I ask him if I'm a rebound, he would say no.
I ask him if he's projecting his ex on me, he would say no.

I talk about this to him about this for soo long.
I want to ask how I should address this situation without hurting him. I mean.. What is the effective way of addressing it.

We talk about it and we never spark an argument.

I don't want to rush to end things with him. I need time to process all of this...",1,1585057855,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fo5fcs/hi_i_need_advice_about_communication_in/,AskMen,1

As the title says, I can't cry.

It all started with me losing my brother 6years ago to a bike accident. My bike infact, which he stole for a day to go on a trip with his friends. 

I was not so close with my brother, I wish I was. I used to teach him how to ride a bike after my parents insisted. I see it as a chore and quickly do it and get back to my gaming. I wish i had taught him better. He crashed into a bus and hit his head. He died that night having internal bleeding and heart attack with immense pain. The amount of guilt I have for all that is a lot. 

After that, I try to forget the pain, I try to forget I ever had a brother. Hoping that it would help me forget about it. My parents always fight after that, they are on the verge of divorce. I hate going home. They are always shouting.

I am not in the best of my health either. I have a bad ankle. I can't workout properly, let alone have the motivation for it. 

Sorry for the long text, I started out writing on how I can cry and relieve myself of this sadness, I ended up pouring out a lot of my sadness. 

If anyone knows how I can relieve myself by crying, please tell me. I feel am always upto the brim, but never been able to cry out properly. All I do is shed a tear..",0,1585053902,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fo4i6f/i_just_want_to_cry_but_i_cant/,AskMen,1

She ended up going overseas with a mutual friend of ours who was pursuing the same degree. She had long been friends with this guy and had always told me to not worry about him because they couldn't be compatable  and he was mostly interested in guys anyways.

Fast forward a year and they're both back in canada due to the COVID crisis and - surprise surprise - they've been together for 10 months..

fo0lx0,FourAM-Throwaway,How do you get out of a rut? (21M),"Honestly, the last few weeks have taken a crazy turn for the worst. I've pushed away some of my closest friends, lost my job and my mental health has just been down. The only thing that cheers me up is playing some video games with a mate, or sleeping.

In the process of all of this, I've lost about 7kg and I'm getting frequent anxiety attacks. I know it sounds silly but my whole life just feels like it's turned upside down. I have no routine.

I had a little burst of motivation last week right before I lost my job and ordered myself an amazing home gym. It arrived yesterday and holy shit, I have lost so much strength and muscle mass. I get anxiety every single time I check my weight. I have no appetite. Nothing interests me. 

I haven't been able to get into the 'zone'. I just feel worthless. I had 0 emotion when I went for my exit interview. I've got decent savings, I've got a home and I have some friends. I've just disappointed too many people and I'm starting to let myself down at every corner.

Now here's the kicker. I desperately want to get better. I want to inspire my friends and those around me. I've just sunk so low and I'm not sure if I can trust myself to follow through. I can't even hold myself accountable. I went to my gym a few hours ago, lifted some weights, did some pullups and a few other things and then just went back inside my house. It's pathetic, I know.

I used to be so productive, strong and I used to inspire my friends. I just don't feel happy anymore and not sure where to begin.

Whenever I get a message notification, I get anxiety. I've had suicidal ideations but I figured that's normal. I don't think I'm depressed. I'm just empty and I don't know how to get back on track.

Can someone guide me out of this? I would really appreciate any advice.

fo06v0,cookiedough226,Boyfriend (35M) won't let me (30F) in his room because he says it's too messy...,"My boyfriend (38M) and I (30F) have been dating for about 1.5 years.  We are really close, get along well, and see each other almost every day -- but almost 90% of the time we hang out at my place.  I have a roommate and live with my dog in a two-bedroom apartment.  My boyfriend lives in a one-bedroom apartment with his brother, and they've lived in the same apartment for about twenty years now.  His brother has a bed in the living room and my boyfriend has the room.  Their rent is super affordable and my boyfriend is saving up to buy a house.  

The thing is -- my boyfriend has never let me inside his room and he will never FaceTime with me while he is in his room.  He says he's uncomfortable with showing me his room/""batcave"" because it's messy, and he has a lot of stuff that has taken up space for the twenty years he's lived there.  Whenever I visit him, we hang out in his living room.  We've also never had sex at his place (does that matter?) and he's never tried to have sex with me there.  His ex-girlfriend would stay over at least once or twice a week (they broke up a couple years ago), but I don't know why I'm any different.

Is this weird?  I feel like it's weird.  I'm trying not to make a big deal about it, but my dog peed in my bed tonight (he's old and incontinent).   I asked my boyfriend if I could stay over and he said he was still uncomfortable and that he still needs to clean his room.  I'm particularly annoyed about this, especially tonight because I have to sleep on the couch while I wait for my laundry to finish.  I'm trying to respect his space, but it's getting a bit unreasonable.  You haven't cleaned your room well enough in the past 1.5 years and you're a grown man?  I don't even know how to broach the subject without sounding aggressive.  Thoughts?

Coffee went well enough to where she was comfortable wanting to do something again and i have since had her over my place twice. We have hooked up but the only times we hang out is if i am the one initiating. Im not sure if this is because she is a shy person in general or if she just isnt that interested in me.

This is her condition for us having sex and I am happy to oblige, I would never pressure her into anything she isnt totally comfortable with. That said, I hate condoms. Always have.

I cant feel a damn thing through these stupid rubber bags. I have tried Trojan and Skyn brands, bought the thinnest ones possible, but best case scenario I just go through the strokes bored, worst case scenario I go limp inside her because I literally can't feel anything. 

My gf is plenty attractive and I'm always willing to have sex but once I slip a condom on it's like a pause button.

I‚Äôm awkward with girls but only when I‚Äôm also with my father

So I started to notice this a few weeks ago but generally speaking I didn‚Äôt think I was that awkward around girls. In fact I seem to have moderate success, granted I‚Äôm no women slayer but I can hold a decent conversation with only being slightly awkward if I like her.

But the other night I saw a girl I hadn‚Äôt seen in years and we started talking but then my dad came up behind me cause we were out together and suddenly I could even make sense. Like I got so awkward.

Happened again today. Same scenario. Thing is he always tells me off later like ‚Äúwhy are you so awkward around those girls, you‚Äôre up to no good‚Äù.

So like am I normally this awkward just my dad points it out? Is it me, why do I get so bad when I‚Äôm trying to talk to girls in front of my father? Idk how should I tell if I‚Äôm just awkward all the time and it‚Äôs just he tells me?

fnxqou,LeastAttempt7,I (22f) can‚Äôt stop thinking about a guy (23m) that I‚Äôve known since I was 15. I either have to get something happening or get over him. What do i do?,"This guy, we‚Äôll call him Jack, and I met when I was 15 and he was 16. He went to high school in my town and I went to online school. We talked for a while, hung out, but never actually dated. This continued off and one until maybe my freshmen year of college. Still never dated but would occasionally Snapchat, text, FaceTime and talk about making plans but it never actually would happen. He has only ever had 1 real girlfriend in the time that I‚Äôve known him, with 2 other short term girl friends along the way. He has ‚Äúmommy issues‚Äù from when he was little so ive always chalked up his ‚Äúbeing really serious, talking about a relationship, then running away‚Äù routine to that. 

At the end of my freshmen year of college, he had moved out Of his parents and was living with a couple of friends. One day He invited me over to his house and we watched TV, hung out and it was really good. The conversation was good, the mood was good, And everything just flowed. Life happened we didn‚Äôt never really hang out again and we didn‚Äôt talk for probably a year or two. We gradually started snapping or texting randomly sometime last summer I‚Äôd say. At this point he had moved back home to save money and had an excellent job.

This past September, of my senior year of college, I started dating a guy that he used to be pretty good friends with. Soon after we started dating they had an argument (not related to me) and They have not talked since. Me and his friend broke up in November and I started snapping with Jack pretty soon after. We FaceTime and made plans to hang out one night before he went to work, he works a night shift, but of course it never did up happening. One night on the phone we were talking about relationships and me breaking up with his friend and he admitted that he scared of relationships because of how things have worked out in the past and how he just doesn‚Äôt trust people. We would occasionally snap after that stent of talking, and he told me that he was looking for a house and wanted to be on his own. Nothing eventful really happened until last week I added his best friend on Snapchat (who happens to be my ex‚Äôs brother‚Äôs boss so I know him outside of Jack). A few days later jack started snapping me (it was like that opened his eyes made him want to reach out) and asked if I as going to this local bar on Friday. I wasn‚Äôt and told him that and then Saturday he sent out a snap that said he bought a house. Today he sent me pics of his house and when I asked where it was close to he sent me his address. 

I just feel drawn to him. It‚Äôs weird, I know he has given me little to no real attention over the years but I just have a soft spot for him and want to be that girl that he‚Äôs like oh okay not all girls are crappy or are going to leave me. So really what should I do? He gets scared off really easily so I‚Äôm not sure how to approach this. 
I know I probably sound so dumb and like ‚Äúgirl he‚Äôs just not that into you‚Äù but I feel like he‚Äôs just scared and will always turn good things away until it just hits him that he deserve good people.",3,1585019103,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fnxqou/i_22f_cant_stop_thinking_about_a_guy_23m_that_ive/,AskMen,1

fnx0os,CarefulCurrency2,What's the most spectacular/embarrassing/humiliating way you've ruined your chances with a crush?,"So flashback to sophomore year of high school, there's this girl in drumline who went to another school, and who I didn't really know that well but was always very friendly and cheerful with me, always saying hi to me and giving me a smile whenever she saw me at practice. Slowly it dawned on my caveman brain that maybe this was because she liked me as more than just a friend (I'm not saying she actually did, but it sure seemed that way at the time).

Anyway, so at practice one day we're walking back from the gym - where we actually practice - to the band room, which was in a separate building at a distance of about a city block or so. For whatever reason she'd taken her shoes off, and then, I guess just because she didn't feel like walking the rest of the distance, dropped her shoes, cheerfully announced ""\[my name\], catch me!"" and (what at the time seemed like) all but leaped into my arms. Now, she was by no means overweight, and in fact she was, and is, totally gorgeous, but she was definitely curvy - one might even go so far as to describe her as ""dummy thicc"" - whereas  I am very lean and skinny and not strong and  have arms like a stick person. I cannot say that with 100% certainty that a girl you don't know all that well asking you to carry her back to the band room is a proof that she likes you, but I can pretty much guarantee that what I did next is a great way to instantly cure her of a crush on you. I managed to gallantly carry her for about five seconds before my weak stickman arms gave way and I dropped her. She wasn't hurt, laughed it off and assured me no harm was done, and I didn't detect even a temporary change in her demeanor towards me, but I'm pretty sure that incident did for my chances of success with her what fire did to the Hindenburg.",34,1585016112,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fnx0os/whats_the_most_spectacularembarrassinghumiliating/,AskMen,1

And then if/when the relationship doesn‚Äôt work out, they come crawling back to the friend group. Now some don‚Äôt have a problem with us. But for me personally, I take my friendships and relationships seriously.

Even if I can only hang out once in a blue moon I‚Äôll still make the effort. If someone decides that our friendship only matters when they‚Äôre not with a woman, then they aren‚Äôt friends I want to maintain in all honesty. Because for me, friends, once they get close enough, are family.

fnwfkv,advanced-mistake,How can you tell if he's uninterested or just shy? Help a gal overcome her clingy instincts to avoid overwhelming this dude.,"I matched with a school friend on Hinge. He's someone I was interested in before we ever matched: sweet, funny, similar interests and careers (we're both firefighters near the end of our 4 yr program). He's incredibly shy in class so I'd expect similar behavior from him online. However, his shyness makes it really hard to read his behavior. 

He chose to match with me and we've talked a bit on the app. I got his phone number organically (group project for school) and we snapchat occasionally (2x per week or so). He CHOSE to match with me on Hinge and is complementary of my art and academic performance in person and online. But, I have initiated every. single. conversation. He seems to enjoy talking (I think????) but just never starts it. I know from past relationships that I can be clingy and knowing that about myself I work hard to give my partners breathing room. But I genuinely cannot tell if he's uninterested or just warms up at a snail pace. I also worry that he's not interested and just too non-confrontational to say so.

I was never really the jock, or the cool guy, I wasn‚Äôt even that funny really. Looking back on it now I‚Äôm pretty sure I always felt like an outsider or a freak when it came to my peers. And this feeling carries over into how I view myself as an adult, albeit in much smaller way. 

Deep down, there‚Äôs always this fear that I‚Äôm not ‚Äúman‚Äù enough. That I‚Äôm somehow an abnormality among the rest of the members of of my gender. And that the people around me will eventually see me for what I am and choose a ‚Äúrealer‚Äù man to spend their time with.

Of course this is all ridiculous. I know that logically. There is no uniform standard of masculinity among the billions of men that make up this world. Anyways, those are my thoughts. I‚Äôm grateful, if that‚Äôs the right word, to have finally vocalized them.

I don't think I'll ever approach anyone. People who want me to be their friend will have to drag me out of my house to get me to hang out with them. Women will have to chase me down and drag me into their home to get me to date them.

I don't know what I can do and I don't want to approach people at all. I would rather that they come to me first and take the lead. That's something that I would like and would feel comfortable with. I've recently come to the realization that maybe this is just who I am. Maybe I'm just naturally shy and it'd be too out of character for me to start approaching people.

fnpnfq,mistermyguy,Are any of you experiencing a lost in interest dating women and if so how are you dealing with it?," 

I'm 34. The ""fun"" in spending weeks talking to women on online dating, to then ask for the date, then pay for the date, just for the woman to potentially choose they aren't interested sounds and now has revealed itself to me as a grueling process I don't want to endure anymore and I'm extremely concerned for my future and mental health.

I have in the past been very upbeat about meeting new women and ""finding a good one"" to settle down with as a girlfriend but they don't come anymore. The women I've been meeting and going on dates with almost universally appear to bring nothing to the table at the date in terms of conversation or picking a place/entertainment, but expect you to, as well as you to pay and seem to be consciously aware this gives them the upper hand and project it with insufferable attitudes. I don't know if dating was always like this or there's been a cultural change but I can't be imagining it. Or am I?

Every date just feels so ""one sided"", with the woman contributing and investing almost nothing into it in terms of effort. Barely even dressing nice. They know they can just replace you because there's no shortage of lonely single men. 

Are there any men experiencing this? How do you deal with it? I don't want to be alone but I am tired of spending money, dignity and time into people who don't care about me and can replace me way faster than I could ever dream of replacing them. I simply just don't enjoy their company any more. And it's kind of freaking me out. I don't want this but it is all that's logical. 

If it matters, my sex life isn't dry. Lot's of one night stands. Just tired of all this work and effort for people who don't care about me.",18,1584989919,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fnpnfq/are_any_of_you_experiencing_a_lost_in_interest/,AskMen,1

I'm not a nofap'er but within the last year I noticed if I don't fap for a few days my sex drive goes nuts.  Which is awesome i had friends I fooled around with and made some horny bad choices.  You know the post nut maybe i shouldn't have done that.  I don't find you as interesting as I did before kinda thing, hate cuddling with people im not emotionally invested in.  There was another post I read talking about severe post nut syndrome and im not that bad as I do care about other people's feelings and do my best to accommodate.  I was married once and in love and no amount of post nut could make me not want to be near her afterword.  So I get having real attachment makes a huge difference.  So currently im talking to a long time friend who is down for all sorts of perverted shit,  which im not against, but after a few days I'm cuckoo for cocoapuffs for. And I love it,  all the fucked up shit she's into i feel like i can match at the peak and its awesome.  But then there's the post nut and its not like im disgusted or anything I just feel like I landed back in boring mode and it makes me kinda embarrassed that I'm not on her level anymore.

fnni9p,ConcussionsForNothin,When will a new mom's stomach return to normal?,"Guys...

I've been seeing a girl of 28 with a one year old son and her stomach has extra/loose skin and stretch marks. This turns me off.. her boobs are also not very firm. I'm wondering if and when these things will change.

I've also been seeing a girl of 33 with a 5 year old daughter and her body looks great, none of the issues mentioned above. Is it just because it's been longer since she gave birth?

As a third data point, a girl I hooked up with who had two kids, in the 5-10 range I think, had a stomach that still looked like the first girl... which makes me think the stomach issues won't necessarily disappear with time. 

Please drop some knowledge on me, I don't have kids and now that I'm 33 a lot of my dates are moms.

 I really love spending time in front of the computer, playing games and talking with irl's and online friends over discord.

This has made me into somewhat of a recluse, I don't meet new people, I only try tinder which i'm absolute garbage at, I manage to get laid every now and then, but definitely not often.

How do I actually change my mindset to take more responsibility, to become more of a man? I'm feeling a bit hopeless at the moment, i'm afraid i'm going to be single for a long time because of these things.

Should I try to talk to a therapist or something to try to get to the root cause of these issues?",13,1584973110,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fnkp5w/how_do_i_actually_change/,AskMen,1

I've been nervous before, sure, but never before have I had nearly this much trouble when asking a girl out.

&amp;#x200B;

This questions applies to everyone, but let me give you some information about my case: She's a barista, works at a coffee shop that I very frequently visit. I'm not sure if its because I only see her while she's working, but I just can't bring myself to talk to her.

&amp;#x200B;

The strange part is, and I really hope i don't come across like a dick here, but she's not even the prettiest girl that I would've asked. She's gorgeous, don't get me wrong, but i literally can not see why she's giving me so much trouble. I think it comes down to two things: 1. I would really like to know more about her, so a rejection would hurt (internally.), and 2: I go to that shop a lot, but I can always switch shops if something goes array. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually get over it and ask within a few days, but its been a few WEEKS not and its driving me insane! I've made small talk but I just choke up and instantly leave when the next step is asking her to a date.

I've been seeing a girl of 28 with a one year old son and her stomach has extra/loose skin and stretch marks. This turns me off.. her tits are also not very firm. I'm wondering if and when these things will change.

I've also been seeing a girl of 33 with a 5 year old daughter and her body looks great, none of the issues mentioned above.  Is it just because it's been longer since she gave birth?

As a third data point, a girl I hooked up with who had two kids, in the 5-10 range I think, had a stomach that looked like the first girl... which makes me think the stomach issues won't necessarily disappear with time. 

Please drop some knowledge on me, I don't have kids and now that I'm 33 a lot of my dates are moms.

It‚Äôs getting increasingly uncomfortable and it agitates me to no end when I find people / girls staring at me. 
Before you guys are quick to judge, just hear me out a little. 

2 years ago I was a fat, obese 16 yo kid. Now I‚Äôve lost weight and gained muscle etc and I look better and I like the way I look. Regardless of whatever reason why people stare at me, I built my body on my own and it‚Äôs for myself, I didn‚Äôt build it for people to stare and look at me. As someone who was afraid of everyone and had low self esteem, to now having staring at you just makes me feel very uncomfortable. 

This usually happens on the train, train platforms, sometimes at Starbucks, an area near the gym, basically almost everywhere I go, there‚Äôs at least 1 person staring at me. I don‚Äôt look at people. I listen to my music, look at my phone or just rest my eyes on the train. When I wake up or look up from my phone, I catch girls or even sometimes a group of girls looking at me. 

Yes. I have anger management issues as you can tell, but I feel staring at someone is highly disrespectful (unless you‚Äôre dazing off) but this happens on a daily basis. I feel like approaching people and asking them why they are staring at me. I‚Äôm only a few steps away from beating the hell outta someone for staring at me. It‚Äôs annoying. 

I don‚Äôt particular like girls because I was bullied by them for being fat in high school.",0,1584959238,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fnhqfl/i_feel_like_punching_getting_into_a_fight_with/,AskMen,1

fngs73,longshlong69,What keeps you going? What gives your life meaning?,"Tl;dr: used to be a kid that wanted to grow up. Wanted to have that freedom. Now that I am grown up I feel like doing nothing, cuz life seems meaningless 


When I was a teen all I wanted was to grow up. I hated that I was forced to go to school. I always though school was a joke. But now that I‚Äôm 20 and I am an adult I can‚Äôt help but to be mad at myself for how fucking naive i was. If only my bitch ass just stayed on top of my shit, maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have ended up here. 

I remember that the only thing I cared about in high school was my motorcycle. I dreamed of riding, watched countless videos online about bikes, etc. I was a man on a mission. I only gave it 100% if it got me closer to my goal. (Even failed physics because I‚Äôd go to work everyday after school instead of doing homework.) And in senior year of high school I bought my bike. Did I feel accomplished? Sure. But it wasn‚Äôt what I thought It would be like. I had my fun with it for sure, but I moved on. Last year I ended up financing a car (dumbest decision I‚Äôve ever made). And now here I am, with a car that made me broke, and a bike that‚Äôs sitting broken in the garage. I lost interest in my passion for cars/bike. Just watch shows and YouTube videos on them but that‚Äôs it

Was never a star athlete, never a straight A student, never had real success with girls. When my parents were going through their divorce I just found my escape in video games, then it was motorcycles, and then inevitably I started drinking and smoking/ vaping (weed and cigs). I eat like shit, sleep like shit, I feel like shit. 

I can‚Äôt even stay focused on reading a book that could help me better my life because I‚Äôm so easily distracted. I just end up browsing YouTube or reddit after a couple pages. No self discipline. I wouldn‚Äôt say I want to end my life, but I sure as fuck know that I don‚Äôt want to keep going like this. I just want to disappear. I just want some peace and happiness, is that too much to ask for

So my question to you guys is what keep you going, how do you deal with all the stress? What and/or who motivates you to get up and get after it. How can go back to that kid who was like a man possessed. with a goal on his mind, and an iron will to go get after it. With this corona shit going on I feel even more demotivated. Life‚Äôs meaningless for me.

fnfrrr,Sneezes-on-babies,What would make a pop-up/DIY living room dive bar more realistic?,"Weird question, but please hear me out. My boyfriend has been working so hard lately. We recently moved cross country and landed right in the middle of a corona outbreak, so we have been stuck inside for the past week. I know he doesn't want to complain, but I can tell all the changes with moving, work and now being stuck inside are stressing him out so I want to do something nice. 

These next few days are the last he'll be going to the office, so I want to take advantage of the alone time to do something special for him. 

The two of us love going to dive bars together to try new beers, listen to punk music and blow off some steam, but since everything is closed I figured I'd bring the bar to him. 

I have a few ideas on what to add. Beer, chicken wings, peanuts, some fake band posters on the walls- I might put some crumbs on our breakfast bar to make it more authentic. I'm thinking of making a bar menu and playing some music a bit too loud. I might even throw in some mood lighting, but I feel like there's more I could be doing to really bring the grunge home and make it look less like our tiny condo. 

So, if anyone has any idea on what they'd like to see if this was done for them, I'd love to hear it. Has anyone here had their partner throw a surprise for them before? Did they add any extra touches that made it special?",5,1584947593,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fnfrrr/what_would_make_a_popupdiy_living_room_dive_bar/,AskMen,1

I am a unicorn of inexperience - have not had my first kiss, have never been on a date, etc. I could go on and on explaining or making excuses about why but it all boils down to insecurity. 

Recently, I forced myself to face facts: I am stagnant and passive in my life. Feeling behind my peers as I got older fed back into my initial insecurities and now it‚Äôs even harder to put myself out there. Now, I am trying to take more initiative in trying new things, staying informed, and getting cultured. The hope is that the more I build my own identity, the more comfortable I am finding someone that I can start something with.

fnfgec,Spirited-While,How do I let a guy subtlety know I want him to ask me out?,"So there‚Äôs a guy at work that I‚Äôm really interested in, and there‚Äôs a lot of tension between us. There has been for months, we both have a lot in common, find each other hilarious, have connected over similar struggles at work, he‚Äôs been there for me when.. and the chemistry is off the charts. We‚Äôre clearly attracted to each other. 

It‚Äôs the same old story ‚Äòdon‚Äôt know if he/she likes me in that way or is just friendly, don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs just a flirt with everyone, don‚Äôt wanna cross the inappropriate line, plays hot and cold when we get too close blah blah blah‚Äô he‚Äôs also around 10 years older than me so I can see why he‚Äôd be hesitant to make a move but damn that doesn‚Äôt really deter me at all. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure, around 90% sure he‚Äôs into me and has been dropping hints but hasn‚Äôt had the courage to ask yet. He‚Äôs subtlety made sure I know he‚Äôs single or has free plans on special days you‚Äôd normally spend with your SO, he smiles ear to ear and lights up every time he sees me, he‚Äôs always remembering things from other conversations we‚Äôve had and tries to help me without me asking, he clearly gets jealous when I talk to other male coworkers, he‚Äôs always trying to get close via body language without touching and lately he‚Äôs put out ‚Äòhypothetical situations‚Äô like if we were on a date together.  

So from a male perspective, what are things I can do as a woman to give him the green light to straight up ask me out without totally screwing myself over at work?
 I think we both know how the other feels but are both too afraid to make the next step. I‚Äôm really bad at this stuff and want to know how to make him feel comfortable with asking me without dropping lame hints, knowing I won‚Äôt go running off to HR üòÇ

(This is not a question about whether I should or not - I know it‚Äôs usually a bad idea to date where you work but he‚Äôs awesome and I‚Äôve considered the consequences if it goes bad and want to pursue anyway)

fned9t,koohs123,Is my ex-boyfriend‚Äôs best friend stirring the pot or he‚Äôs just insensitive?,"My ex [29M] and I [27F] have broken up for around 6 months now and we haven‚Äôt spoken since. I don‚Äôt have his number, but he still follows me on instagram. His best friend [29M] and I ended up becoming friends thanks to my ex. Even if the relationship is over, I gained a friend from it. My ex-boyfriend seems to be bored because he does nothing but to check my story these past few weeks. 

A few days back, the best friend messaged me and asked me how I‚Äôve been doing. I told him what I‚Äôm up to and randomly talked about the coronavirus when he sneakily inserted the topic of my ex-boyfriend having a new girl. This is an information I did not ask for. My ex-boyfriend and I had a rocky relationship, and I am over it. But I really don‚Äôt want any news about him and the best friend knows this. I told him after I broke up with my ex. I just responded ‚Äúokay‚Äù and his best friend kept on going what‚Äôs up with my ex and his girl. When he realized he wasn‚Äôt getting any crazy reaction from me, he started asking me questions about my new guy. I‚Äôve been seeing a guy these past 2 months. It‚Äôs nothing serious, but the guy is great. I didn‚Äôt give out much information either cause I don‚Äôt want him to feed my ex-boyfriend with information (assuming he does). 

Am I just overreacting or was it insensitive of him to tell me things I did not ask for? It‚Äôs because of all the things the best friend told me which is why I broke up with my ex-boyfriend and the best friend knew the pain I‚Äôve gone through being with my ex. He consoled me!

fne4fk,U_PassButter,He penis'd people of reddit! Can I get some advice about my friend that I wanna smash?,"TL;DR: I wanna bone my guy friend after finding out we were both sexually attracted to eachother, but he's got a girlfriend and i dont want to make him feel uncomfortable, because there is so much sexual tension now, but we are both loyal and NOT romantic. We're like Rick and Morty, if they were both in their late 20s, male and female young adults that kinda wanna bang. 

My buddy ""Max"" is super cool. We have been friends for about 5 years.

How it started:  I was dating someone (early stages) when he and I met. We worked together and just became ""work besties"". Same kind of crude humor, always have a good time, and great serious talks. 

Fast forward..
I moved out of state with my boyfriend at the time, we'll call him Asshat.
Asshat and I did great. Together 4 years. Asshat proposed, then got cold feet and backed out. 

I move home. 

Talking to Max for support. He's great and he now has a girlfriend. Genuinely happy for him! 


Idk what happened or how we got their, but again we are HUGE jokesters and never really thought anything of it. 

We were texting, and He joked about ""tagging in"" (we had always made those jokes, at work. We worked in an environment where you have to lose those boundaries quickly)

So, I'm single and I have no filter, and I was like ""I mean if your girl is okay with it, then yeah I'm in""

And he was surprised like ""wait what"" and we started to talk about it and turns out he would definitely smash, and we both didn't know the other would smash. But we were both super loyal and would never ACTUALLY cross a line that out partners we not comfortable with. Even in conversation. Our S.Os even joked the same way when we all went out, before I moved away for 4yrs. 

But.....I think theres is suddenly ALOT of sexual tension between us. But we still wanna hang out. It's just idk. 

TL;DR: I wanna bone my guy friend after finding out we were both sexually attracted to eachother, but he's got a girlfriend and i dont want to make him feel uncomfortable, because there is so much sexual tension now, but we are both loyal and NOT romantic.

fncl6g,hahahihihoehoe,"Not interested in girls anymore for no particular reason, have any of you experienced this before?","So I'm a dude in my mid-twenties and have completely lost my motivation to pursue any relationships or hookups. I downloaded Tinder yesterday, had some nice matches and chats, but suddenly for no reason at all just deleted my account in the middle of the conversations for no particular reason. I just wanted to get away from them.

I find all women simply boring (have never in my life met one that really wasn't to be honest). The ""I am so ugly"" bullshit where they have zero confidence or want me to convince them they are, the ""I am super pretty so you better work hard to get into my pants"" bullshit and being all cocky, the good morning messages after you get their number which you have to reply to, otherwise it's just rude. I just hate the fact that I have to be texting for hours every day, talk on the phone, check out the snaps they send and send snaps back, picking them up and going to fancy places to eat, etc. The moment a girl gets interested and starts to pursue me it's just so off putting. I get this ""just please shut the fuck up and fuck off"" feeling, no matter how cute or hot the girl is, I just want to get rid of all of them.

I have no mental issues. I hated my job, got fired, but feel perfectly fine about it all. I have an excellent financial situation, bought my dream car recently, have great friends, etc. I sometimes have the motivation to find a girlfriend, but the moment I start texting a girl or getting in touch with girls in any way, I immediately find it really boring and get rid of them by blocking them out of the blue. I am totally against the whole MGTOW bullshit and whatever, and I don't believe women are shallow and stupid in general, but I just can't seem to find any of them interesting enough to be in a relationship with or get married to and have kids with. It feels like, I really want to be a dad, but not a husband or boyfriend.

Has anyone experienced this before? My last serious relationship was a year ago and since then I only had the occasional hookup and ghosting stuff which we are all familiar with I assume. This is so fucking weird. I used to dream of having pretty girls running after me and pursuing me, trying to get my attention and wanting to get validation from me.

fncfd3,thecatsmeow524,(Female) Not sure if my partner is wearing the right condom...,"Female here, and never thought I‚Äôd be asking this on behalf of my partner (who would never, ever do so himself). Going backwards in time, my first boyfriend used condoms every time because I wasn‚Äôt on the pill. He was very under-average in length but average in girth, and used regular Skyn condoms. I don‚Äôt remember ever actually thinking anything about how they looked on him. 

Fast-forwarding several years ‚Äî my current partner and I have always gone bareback because I‚Äôm taking BC. But lately I‚Äôve read one too many ‚Äúgot pregnant on the pill‚Äù stories and decided we‚Äôre going to use double protection. I bought some of the same Skyn condoms but...I think they‚Äôre too small.

My current partner is well-endowed, a very solid 7‚Äù erect and slightly above average girth (not sure what it is exactly but it‚Äôs respectable). When he put the condom on, it looked SO tight, especially around the tip. I don‚Äôt think there was any pouch left at the end. To me (a female) it looked *terribly* uncomfortable. He was a virgin before we dated, so this was his first time wearing a condom. Also, he was pulled out of Sex Ed class and was never shown how to wear one by anyone; in his early 30s, he didn‚Äôt know how to roll it on so I did it. (You‚Äôre all gonna picture some ugly fat dude but according to everyone but him, he‚Äôs a actually a pretty attractive guy and really fit, he just had a really strict upbringing). 

Anyway, after we‚Äôd been intimate I asked him how it was wearing protection and he said, ‚Äúit sucks.‚Äù Of course it‚Äôs going to suck after going bareback for over six months and never having worn one before, BUT I‚Äôm also concerned that maybe the fit restricted the sensation too.

fnbepn,ipkis1,How to tell a girl you're not into her?,"Long story. I started dating this girl about 6 months ago. Now I don't know what to do.

If I should post this to r/relationship_advice tell me and I will delete the post, but I wanted a man opinion on this.

BACKGROUND:

We were classmates in college and we were even working together for 1 year. We didn't talk that much, but we were always friendly and got along fine. I always kind of  liked her, because she was different. But I had 2 long term relationships during this time, so it never crossed my mind that I would flirt with her or think of her that way.

HOW IT STARTED:

Me, my friend and her (all of us were working together a couple of years ago) went for a friendly drink one friday night. A couple of drinks later it started raining and she suggested what we go to her place for a beer or 2. My friend left, and I ended there alone with her. We talked a LOT that night, and after a couple of beers we ended on the bed, making out (that was it). We started texting after that and we still had a lot to talk about. 

SITUATION NOW:

It is standard: movie, sex, breakfast. A good time if you ask me. I am still living with my parents, so we are hanging out at her place like once or twice a week. She is from a different town and is living here on her own. My mom knows that I am visiting a girl 1-2x week, but she didn't tell her mom anything about her dating a guy or anything.  
In the beginning we talked about what this all means, and we both agreed that this, as it is, it's enough and we will see. For me, it's still enough. My problem is that I have a really hard time mentioning things that are difficult to talk about. And I think she is the same, but she won't admit it. Today she said that we need to talk about us, and I know what it means. I really think she in love with me.

MY PROBLEM:

I want to be her friend, because we get along just fine. But I  really tried to picture her as my future girlfriend but I couldn't, and I don't know why. Little things about her bother me. Sometimes it can be the way she says something or just her way of thinking. But on the other hand, I like a lot of things about her that I value. But she doesn't have the same lifestyle as me. I'm more outdoorsy, but she travels a lot more that me. And lately I don't find out conversations as interesting as I did before.

QUESTION: 

How should I mention this? I like her, I like talking with her every day, sharing stupid stuff and jokes with her. But I am not in love with her, and I think she is. I know the easiest and most effective way would be just asking. But we haven't talked about this since the beginning and I think it may be too late to end it without someone getting hurt.

I really don't know how and what to say, do you guys have any tips or similar experiences? Or should I try and put in the effort to make it work?

&amp;#x200B;

// TL;DR //

fnbboj,Atirent,Me (26f) and bf (24m) have different definitions of relationships and friendships which has been causing problems,"My bf and I have different meanings for relationships and friendships, need advice on how to reconcile them

Me and bf have been dating quite a few years and while we love each other, have had quite a few problems which today we realized all have the same root, we have different standards for both friendships and relationships.

To my bf a relationship is: when you tell each other your deepest darkest secrets because you‚Äôre comfortable with one another, when you would do almost anything for the other within reason, and when you love that person above all others even yourself.

Minus the loving that person above all others even yourself, while I do think those things should be apparent in a relationship, I think they aren‚Äôt out of the ordinary for a good friendship. Whereas for me, I see a relationship as most of those and arena to actively and intentionally express your love for one another. 

Hence, we have constant problems where in his opinion he‚Äôs doing things to express his affections while I don‚Äôt recognize them because I read them as regular expressions of friendship.

How do you all describe the differences between a relationship and friendship and do you all have any advice on how to reconcile these differences?

Tldr: my standards for a good friendship or my bf‚Äôs standards for a relationship which is causing problems",0,1584926444,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fnbboj/me_26f_and_bf_24m_have_different_definitions_of/,AskMen,1

fnb29m,valencia5,What would you think of light BDSM requests when having sex with someone new?,"I (24F) am very submissive and enjoy sex significantly more when the guy acts quite dominant (nothing really extreme, I think). I've asked for it twice with uninterested to bad reactions. So I want to see if there's consensus. What's your opinion? 

We're talking anything that signals dominance from the guy: grabbing my hair, grabbing my face, holding my wrists against the mattress, grabbing my neck (no real chocking, though. Big fan of oxygen), some spanking and scratching, forcing eye contact when im giving head and also pushing my head, manhandling and that sort of thing. Maybe sometimes being a bit forceful and intense, but more than that, being in control. I also love verbal encouragement, things such as ""good girl"", ""good job"", ""come here"", ""here, baby do this"" and the likes. I like to have to beg to go down on him or to be fucked... However, to mix things up, I hate degradation, being called a ""slut"" etc. I like to be dominated and controlled from a place of care and respect in a way... ask my brain about that one, I don't get it either :)

 I'd like to clarify I don't expect cirque du Soleil energy, just writing that last paragraph made me exhausted (maybe on my birthday? ...4th of July?) Also, submissive =/= pillow princess, I'm a very committed and enthusiastic player!  I have no problem changing things up but this is my clear preference and I think I need it at least occasionally to be sexually satisfied. 

Lastly, how would you like a girl to approach this topic? is it so serious that you think it should come up in conversation beforehand (to give you a chance to run away screaming)? Maybe you can think of ways to find out how they feel about it beforehand without making it super explicit? Or to introduce the idea while having a drink in a way that's hot and not scary? 

TL,DR; I want to ask for dominant things during sex from the future men I have sex with. I'd like to see what men in general think about that since my experience so far hasn't been too positive. Also, how to introduce the topic to the hypothetical guy in question.",22,1584925369,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fnb29m/what_would_you_think_of_light_bdsm_requests_when/,AskMen,1

Since that night, whenever I start to get hard, the tip of my dick hurts. When I‚Äôm soft, I can‚Äôt see any abrasions or cuts, or anything. When I‚Äôm hard I can feel a muscle fiber in the head of the penis that feels like a pulled muscle and if I massage it (like deep tissue style), I feel like that‚Äôs what is causing the pain. 

I don‚Äôt even know if muscle fiber is what I‚Äôm feeling. What else could be there?

No matter how much I massage, the same symptoms remain. It‚Äôs caused issues when I bring home new women and it really doesn‚Äôt help me in my sex life regardless, being slightly painful and all. 

Has anyone ever heard of this or treated this?

Well the time has come to shove this kid out of the nest and onto his bike... except that all he does is complain about how stupid it is and how he shouldn't have to learn this. 

Small back story detail, this kid was hugely neglected when he was younger so he's not used to being challenged or even just how to respond to adult instruction. I had to teach him how to read because last summer he had a kindergarten reading level and going into 3rd grade (he moved in with my family and I over the summer). This kid is also manipulative as fuck and will turn on the water works in an instant if it means that he will get out of doing something he doesn't want to. I'm tired of this kid constantly putting himself down.

I told him it‚Äôs not like the movies and governments in 1st world countries like ours are good about this stuff and it won‚Äôt be like the purge, which is what he insisted will happen.

fn6ko7,RockyRamboWick,As a man how do I stop being easily tearful and weepy eyed?,"I know this is supposed to be getting more socially acceptable but the things that can set me off just aren't. I don't mean like full on noisy crying. I just mean the kind of quiet, eyes welled up and weeping kind of crying or I'll rub my eyes to wipe away the build up.

I have always been easily brought to tears and as a child my dad would complain about me crying. Well into adulthood that hasn't gotten much better. I try to hide it as much as I can but it doesn't change that it happens. The best thing I've seem to come up with is to try and numb myself to everything and develop an indifference to most things. I find the lower my expectations and the less hopeful I am the less likely I am to have a tearful emotional reaction to it.

Some of the kind of things that will make me tearful are things like getting rejected, getting called into the office by a boss that I am fearful of, having a stressful day and just feeling overwhelmed, genuinely making an effort at something and failing. I even cried at a funeral of a man nobody there including me really even liked. When I started my very first job over a decade ago I was so overwhelmed by how horrible it was that my eyes would just be constantly tearful. I had to keep going to the toilet to dry my eyes. I'm not quite as bad as that now although there have been times where I felt that way more recently.

How do I stop being so easily tearful? I do my best to kind of hold back my emotions in my head. You know stiff upper lip and all that but it doesn't really help much. Also I find it difficult to be confrontational if I am teary eyed although confrontation doesn't cause me to get teary eyed though.",4,1584908887,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fn6ko7/as_a_man_how_do_i_stop_being_easily_tearful_and/,AskMen,1

fn6cgb,IncomingSizeMover,Do you let what others wants affect what you want?,"TLDR: Do you always state what you truly want, or do you take into account what you think the other person wants first?

So I ended things with a girl I've been dating and in the aftermath she told me that she was disappointed that I hadn't expressed a wish to continuing as friends. I tried to tell her that I didn't think that would be a good route, especially for her, given that she had started to develop romantic feelings for me. She then stated that she wasn't interested in me taking decisions on her behalf and she wanted to know what I wanted. 

This is just an example, but it got me thinking. My entire life I have never decided what I want, without taking into consideration what the other person wants/benefits from. This does not have to be in the dating sphere, but also in life in general. 

So I guess there is two dogmas:
1) What is it I want. 
2) This is what I want that I think leads us to the best possible outcome. With the least amount of discomfort for both parties. 

Is this just an overcomplicated version of ""the nice guy syndrome""? A result of being shy of conflict? When does the men of Reddit employ 1) Vs 2)? 

I'm not even sure if this makes sense, but curious to see what people think.",4,1584908083,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fn6cgb/do_you_let_what_others_wants_affect_what_you_want/,AskMen,1

Although alot of friends have come and gone, it's at least still fairly easy to meet new people as I can attend meetups for people in their 20s and 30s, I can play board games, and play sports. But I would say most of these people are just acquaintances and shallow friendships, and not like some of the deep friendships I had in the past. It seems that out of these who are also not married and don't have kids, they're still busy with their own stuff and I only see them 1-2 times max per week at meetups

As I think about the future, I'm worried it will get harder and harder to meet people. I won't be able to play sports as much, if at all. I don't see many meetups for singles in their 40s or older, but I guess I can still do boardgame meetups

fn5txl,cjcj91,How would you feel if a girl you previously dated reached out after almost a year of no contact?,"I dated a guy last year for 7 months. We were never exclusive, it was more like an on-and-off situationship. It was really bad timing as I was going through a lot. Prior to meeting him, I gained a lot of weight (70lbs), mainly due to anxiety (comfort eating, sedentary lifestyle). I was incredibly insecure and had no confidence. I was always slim so it was hard to get used to my new obese body. I was losing weight while we were seeing each-other but it was a slow process.

I was very hot/cold with him, and had my guard up the entire time because I could never understand why he showed interest in me. Despite how turbulent the situation was, I did like him.

He ended things with me because of my erratic behaviour. If he got too close, I acted distant so he would back off but then I panicked and acted clingy. Seriously, I just wasn't myself and was certainly not ready to date.

We have had zero contact from he ended it. I tried to end it on good terms but he seemed irritated during our last conversation. Anyway, its 10 months later... I am in a great place, back to my usual self, I have lost all the weight I gained AND MORE! I look and feel good. Definitely ready to get back out there again. 

I am considering reaching out to apologise for my behaviour last year as I would like to reconnect.

fn2z5q,Somejamaicankidd,"Fellas, give it to me straight. How do I navigate this situation/conversation?","Cross Post From Breakups but looking for advice from a woman‚Äôs perspective to see where her head is at.

Dealing with a ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù even though she was my ex? What now?

I‚Äôm (25M) dealing with what feels like a break up again with my (25F) ex girlfriend

So I‚Äôm a little confused and just want a little clarity. We have been together for about 5 years. We broke up about a year ago because she felt as though I wasn‚Äôt committing enough time to her after she moved to my city. 

I had been dealing with a lot family issues, recently laid off, parents going through a divorce, etc. I felt as though I needed a little time to figure everything out and thought that it would take a little time to adjust after bringing our lives together. 

She tried to take back her break up and said that she was rash and impulsive and that she didn‚Äôt mean it. She apologized and tried getting back together but I said no as I was still in shock and it hurt to just be dropped like that amid everything else. 

We stayed in contact and eventually started having sex routinely within the next few months. Fast forward a little less than a year later and I had been doing better. I got a therapist that was awesome. Started antidepressants, found a new rewarding job and had made peace with my parents. I felt like I was ready to give us another try. 

However, she started being a little distant and I could feel it. So I asked her what was up and she confessed that she had began seeing someone else and she wants to see where it goes. I was taken aback I guess because I was in a mode to reconcile while she was dating someone else.

She said she didn‚Äôt want to hurt me and she felt as though she should be honest. She feels as though she just wants to be happy after not being happy for the past year. We spoke and I confessed that I had been in a mode of trying to reconcile. She says she loves me and she still thinks we will be together in the end. I told her, I loved her too and that I didn‚Äôt want to let her go because I was excited to be feeling like myself again. I knew I could be the man that she wanted and loved. She said that the only thing she ever wanted to hear and we almost had make up sex but decided not to. 

Following, she says she feels as though I‚Äôm too late. She waited so long to hear those words but it just feels like they are just words. Why did it take me so long to say them? Am I only saying them because someone else is in the picture? Why did I make her wait? I tried to explain my reasoning and everything that was going on. The progression I was making on my own. 

A couple days later we had our closure talk. She says that she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the end of us and that she thinks we will be together in the end. She says she still loves me and will always love me. Seeing the other guy makes her feel the feelings that she wished she had from me. And he just makes her feel like when we had started dating. She said he‚Äôs just like me and is just doing a lot of the things that she wanted me to do. She wants the best for me and that we just need to time/space to work on ourselves. I told her that I appreciated her for everything. I told her that I‚Äôm not holding anything against her and that when I think back on our relationship, I think of the good times and the fun times we had. I told her that whatever makes her happy is what I want in the end as I just want the best for her. I didn‚Äôt say that I wanted to get back together even though that‚Äôs what I want. We left it at that and now here I am. 

I‚Äôm confused and don‚Äôt know what to do or what to think. It feels like a break up even though we weren‚Äôt together. I feel betrayed and slightly angry that someone ‚Äústole‚Äù her from me or that I walked her right into his arms. I want to get back together but I know I‚Äôm too late in this instance. It‚Äôs also confusing that she says that she loves me and wanted to be with me and sees us together in the end, but still wants to see where things go with this guy because she just wants to feel happiness and appreciation right now. So what next? Any advice, clarity, perspective will be helpful. 

[TL;DR] Ex and I broke up but stayed in contact but now she found someone else. She still wants us to be together though in the end.

EDIT: She reached out and said she wants to have a conversation today to explain everything. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs for closure. Any advice on how to go about it?",8,1584896773,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fn2z5q/fellas_give_it_to_me_straight_how_do_i_navigate/,AskMen,1

She would begin by asking 'what do you want me to do' and that was one of the sexist things a man can hear. Swallowed every time without exception, even at times I needed to jerk off after sex, she would lick my balls and as soon as I came, she would try to put her mouth on top to catch my cum and keep me in her mouth till I was clean.

fn1m7t,obama_llama_drama,"Advice: how to handle an ""almost was"" situation?","Hey, 

Basically, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this guy I was seeing for ~1 month. 
In the time we were seeing one another (which honestly was only 5 dates and we didn't even get to sleep together - that's important below), he was the one who asked to be exclusive and kept saying things like ""My friends have a road trip in July, it'd be great to bring you!"" ""God, I don't want to go on another first date!"" kind of stuff.

Things shifted after we spent a weekend together. When we met up for a drink, I asked him about pulling back and his direct words were like ""We're rushing into this"" ""I don't know if this is exactly what I want to get into"" etc.
He mentioned specifics -- like when I went down on him, I had told him to stop squirming and he took that as a ""Domme"" kind of thing, which he's not into. For the record, neither am I, he seriously was just moving around a lot. (Like hi, we don't want to hurt you or end up biting you guys. Stop squirming when our mouths are so close to your balls!) He also was frustrated about how I was assertive toward a group of folks blocking the sidewalk when getting them to move out of the way. 

I'm paranoid and self-conscious about men commenting on me being assertive / intimidating, because I'm wildly independent and self-sufficient girl. Honestly, I had a boyfriend break up with me because I ""emasculated"" him when I fixed a doorknob for my apartment, when my other roommates called their BFs for help (and neither of those guys could fix it). 

We basically ended things with him saying he wanted to still see me, but not exclusively. I told him I'd want to keep seeing him to get to know him without focusing efforts elsewhere but I wouldn't fuck him if he was fucking other people. Especially because he told me he doesn't like to use condoms. 

I've seen a few guys since him. One guy seems/seemed promising but then COVID-19 hit and he's disappearing, understandably. I can't stop comparing any new guys to him, since things were so fun and easy.

TL;DR: Things ended before they really began with a guy I was seeing. It's been a month and I still can't get over the ""almost was."" What's you experience with these situations? Is it a bad idea to contact him? Or, should I reach out and see if we can try something and just keep communication open when it comes to fucking other people?

fn0497,bssacctforfinance,What should I do about this break up that‚Äôs not really a break up but still is a break up?,"I‚Äôm (25M) dealing with what feels like a break up again with my (25F) ex girlfriend

So I‚Äôm a little confused and just want a little clarity. We have been together for about 5 years. We broke up about a year ago because she felt as though I wasn‚Äôt committing enough time to her after she moved to my city. 

I had been dealing with a lot family issues, recently laid off, parents going through a divorce, etc. I felt as though I needed a little time to figure everything out and thought that it would take a little time to adjust after bringing our lives together. 

She tried to take back her break up and said that she was rash and impulsive and that she didn‚Äôt mean it. She apologized and tried getting back together but I said no as I was still in shock and it hurt to just be dropped like that amid everything else. 

We stayed in contact and eventually started having sex routinely within the next few months. Fast forward a little less than a year later and I had been doing better. I got a therapist that was awesome. Started antidepressants, found a new rewarding job and had made peace with my parents. I felt like I was ready to give us another try. 

However, she started being a little distant and I could feel it. So I asked her what was up and she confessed that she had began seeing someone else and she wants to see where it goes. I was taken aback I guess because I was in a mode to reconcile while she was dating someone else.

She said she didn‚Äôt want to hurt me and she felt as though she should be honest. She feels as though she just wants to be happy after not being happy for the past year. We spoke and I confessed that I had been in a mode of trying to reconcile. She says she loves me and she still thinks we will be together in the end. I told her, I loved her too and that I didn‚Äôt want to let her go because I was excited to be feeling like myself again. I knew I could be the man that she wanted and loved. She said that the only thing she ever wanted to hear and we almost had make up sex but decided not to. 

Following, she says she feels as though I‚Äôm too late. She waited so long to hear those words but it just feels like they are just words. Why did it take me so long to say them? Am I only saying them because someone else is in the picture? Why did I make her wait? I tried to explain my reasoning and everything that was going on. The progression I was making on my own. 

A couple days later we had our closure talk. She says that she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the end of us and that she thinks we will be together in the end. She says she still loves me and will always love me. Seeing the other guy makes her feel the feelings that she wished she had from me. And he just makes her feel like when we had started dating. She said he‚Äôs just like me and is just doing a lot of the things that she wanted me to do. She wants the best for me and that we just need to time/space to work on ourselves. I told her that I appreciated her for everything. I told her that I‚Äôm not holding anything against her and that when I think back on our relationship, I think of the good times and the fun times we had. I told her that whatever makes her happy is what I want in the end as I just want the best for her. I didn‚Äôt say that I wanted to get back together even though that‚Äôs what I want. We left it at that and now here I am. 

I‚Äôm confused and don‚Äôt know what to do or what to think. It feels like a break up even though we weren‚Äôt together. I feel betrayed and slightly angry that someone ‚Äústole‚Äù her from me or that I walked her right into his arms. I want to get back together but I know I‚Äôm too late in this instance. It‚Äôs also confusing that she says that she loves me and wanted to be with me and sees us together in the end, but still wants to see where things go with this guy because she just wants to feel happiness and appreciation right now. So what next? Any advice, clarity, perspective will be helpful.

When I try to form friendships or bonds with others, it seems as though most people have their own groups and it's a challenge to make a relationship with them.

In all honesty, I think it has to do with the fact that I'm a fairly boring person and I've been working non stop ever since I graduated from college. My only real goals are saving as much money as I can and moving out of New York. Because of this, I believe I don't have a lot to offer to others.

The real hobbies and interests I have are fairly niche and it's a struggle to find groups where I live that have the same passion. I also do have a goal but it's a tall order to complete while you're working a full time job.

He has quite a stressful job and also hustling on the side for this startup. I love that he is so serious about what he wants in life. 
He would tell me on several occasions that having my presence and spending time with me makes him happy and he stops thinking about work, which relieves the stress. He said watching me smile and giggle and having this cheerful disposition just makes him happy. 

So far, the little actions that I‚Äôve done that I think will help: 
- random cuddles, making his bed
- stocking up his fridge with beers and beverages 
- make breakfast together

Hello men of reddit, I have a question, something that has been bothering me for the entire relationship. My boyfriend is not at all interested in having sex with me. We barely have sex, maybe once a month if I‚Äôm lucky. It has always been like this, even though when I met him, he told me he was glad to get away from his ex girlfriend, who never wanted to have sex, even though he did. The first half year of our relationship, there was nothing wrong with me physically, I looked fine, wasn‚Äôt fat, nothing. I am now, but so is he, much more than I am. Difference is, I‚Äôm still attracted to him. He jerks off regularly, and even prefers this over doing it with me. He refuses to help me in any way, he‚Äôs always the recipient. I jerk him off, give him blowjobs, but I never get anything in return but the monthly sex. 

What can I do? He‚Äôs given me a different reason for not wanting to have sex every single time, so it‚Äôs not one central reason. He just keeps making excuses and refuses to meet me in the middle.

fmygt5,feilong411,What is the most vindictive thing you‚Äôve done to an ex?,"My ex was an ex heroin addict, alcoholic and frequent drunk driver.  She was also a kleptomaniac.  She cheated on me and abused me verbally for months, and her 6 year old daughter as well (no physical stuff but yelling at her for almost nothing.). I pleaded with her to stop but she wouldn‚Äôt. So when she started rehab and brokeup with me by text I sent her parents a letter letting them know every detail and to watch her like a hawk.  A few weeks later I found out she had still been married when we were together.  I decided to have a custom garbage pail kid designed.  I named it ‚ÄúCrackhead Kim.‚Äù 

I commissioned an artist to draw a picture of her standing there with glassy eyes.  There was a table in the background with heroin, pills and cocaine and bottles of vodka.  She always got mad because I didn‚Äôt trust her (can‚Äôt imagine why) so I had time magazine posters in the background that said ‚Äúmost trustworthy person of the year‚Äù and ‚Äúmother of the century‚Äù.   Other posters included one with the word empathy crossed out.  There was a calendar on the wall with names of different men and dates and times she planned sexual favors for them while I was away.  I put a shirt on her that said married.  I put up a clothesline in the background with 5 different shirts.  One said ‚Äúhow to drink, drive and survive, another ‚Äútrust, no matter what,‚Äù another ‚Äústealing, it just happens I don‚Äôt know why‚Äù another ‚Äúmother of the year‚Äù and finally ‚Äúhow to psychologically damage someone in just 6 months!‚Äù  
There was vomit on the ground.  

Finally I sent a letter with it telling her thanks for the STD.  She never gave me one.  She must have panicked because she started calling me and texting me and I hadn‚Äôt spoken to her in months. I blocked her. 

I did all this while she was in rehab for the first time.

Vindictive, sure.  Justified?  Well it was as much for the child as it was for me.  I didn‚Äôt want her to have a chance at retaining custody.  So yeah, you be the judge.

fmy4cr,Familiar-Highway,Asking themMen a regular question about Reddit,"Are there too many rules and a lot of autocensorship and other censorship when posting at Reddit? It shouldn't be easier to post for an ordinary man?

I lost a quite big $CAN tonight because on my cell phone the picture showing the post was achieved was too small and the post came while I was working and actually just simply occasionally glancing at Reddit and interested in the very latest news and posts. While reading the post at my screen I was thinking it is new and that a Reddit user needed immediate help and wanted to comment from my cell which I couldn't.

So I stopped working ( and then started losing money) and went home to comment from my PC that has a big screen and I actually saw the post was archieved. In the end, I was laughing how funny all the happening was.  When I posted about that ( the funny true story) at the place from which the post I read came all my posts were removed by auto and live moderators by some blah blah too many rules?????

Where is easiness and freedom to say simply something here if a potential psycho may easier post something than a simple regular man?ü§î

fmxupw,for_the_spam,Advise about sex (I‚Äôm a female),"Here‚Äôs my situation. My boyfriend and I haven‚Äôt had sex in over a month. I try initiating things but he‚Äôs usually tired or just smiles at me about it. 
It‚Äôs sporadic. Sometimes we have periods of time when there‚Äôs plenty of sex to satisfy my needs, but then we go through dry spells when he‚Äôs less interested. We‚Äôve been together 6 years now and we still find each other attractive. We constantly tell each other how much we love one another. He‚Äôs really sweet, but I‚Äôm unsatisfied when it comes to sex. 

Disclaimer: I‚Äôve never had an orgasm, but I‚Äôm not holding that against him since I myself can‚Äôt get it done. I really do enjoy sex and foreplay, but it seems like I enjoy it more than him. 
Also, he‚Äôs into hentai and regularly masturbates, which I think is really healthy and I don‚Äôt hold it against him, but I just feel like because he‚Äôs satisfying himself, he doesn‚Äôt pay attention to my needs. 

We just talked about it today and he feels bad because he says when he gets horny, it‚Äôs usually when I‚Äôm about to fall asleep or early in the morning, which I‚Äôm fine with, I‚Äôve never turned him down for sex, so I didn‚Äôt really understand how that matters.  Anyways, I feel bad making him feel bad and I feel bad for myself.

fmutb3,tacogoboom,How have you dealt with emotional stunting?,"For the past few years, I (M 20) have been treating various underlying mental health issues with medication, because therapy and the sort was not working for me. After taking the meds, the underlying issues (depression, anxiety) felt better, but something still felt off. As time went on it just got worse and worst until recently when I realized I have been emotionally stunted for a long time. 

I realize now that I have been feeling emotionally null for a long time, but I was never really able to comprehend it. It seems to have started around the time I began my medication (Buspar and Lexapro), so perhaps changing my medication to a different dose or perhaps an entirely different prescription could help somehow. However, I've also read accounts of other men becoming emotionally stunted permanently, and never regaining their ability to feel complete emotion or empathy. This terrifies me.

Being able to form strong emotional connections and empathize with people are some of the only things I am truly proud of myself for. I was always the guy you could come to when you had a problem, and although I can still comprehend the concept of empathy and put on a sort of facade, it all feels so fake. I want to feel again and know that my emotions haven't left me for good.

So does anyone have any advice for me? Any type of solution or possible remedy? Is this a very real issue that I should seek immediate help for, or am I blowing all of this out of proportion?

fmsnr2,tkuethrowrateawayme,Have you ever developed attraction toward someone you would never have been attracted to in the past?,"Long story short, the wife of my husband's brother (36) doesn't care about her look or femininity. She's short hair, doesn't shave, a robust body and quite rude manners. While I visited my husband's family (my openly gay brother joined us) we've gone to a club (me and husband, my brother, his brother).

His brother is an introverted man and not used to the club atmosphere (attractive young people dancing and flirting). He even drank a bit much and sat on a sofa because he didn't want to dance.

My brother (19) is clearly a guy, and very good-looking albeit quite short, but he also has an overall feminine appearance (smooth skin, stylish middle-lenght hair, lean body) plus kind and flirty manners.

My brother sat on the lap of my husband's brother and I saw him putting an hand on his hip. Later, my brother told me my husband's brother had an erection and caressed his back and butts in the car, when we were returning home.

My husband laughed at this, saying his brother is absolutely straight and he's regretting it. He also said it was probably because of a mix of alcohol, atmosphere and, half-jokingly, my brother being more attractive to straight men than his brother's wife.

My brother continued to tease him saying it was only for fun. But now, my husband's brother told us he'll came alone to visit us (next December). I suspect he could be attracted to my brother.

fmro47,macheriemarie,Found out my now ‚Äúex‚Äù is a coke addict.,"I was dating my now ex for a little over 3 years. This week I broke up with him for good. In the beginning yes I caught him cheating on me, it was a lot of back and forth (me believing he would change and so on). This pass year I thought he changed. We spent way more time together than ever, we also spent every holiday together, brought me around him family etc. I know that‚Äôs normal, but being the type of hot and cold person he is I thought he was making an afford, by involving me so much. 

I live in LA and he thought it was best that I stayed with him during the beginning of the quarantine in Long Beach. We usually do go to bars a lot and like to drink. The problem was I noticed he literally drank a whole case a night, plus my wine almost every night I was there. He would become very obnoxious, and very verbally abusive. Everything I did or said bothered him during this day. I started to not even talk so I wouldn‚Äôt set him off, then if I didn‚Äôt talk he would say I was acting like a bitch. 

The last night I was there before I ended things, he began drinking. Then right next to me he started contacting a prostitute and sent them a picture of his dick. I immediately flipped out and he said I was seeing things. Then he admitted to it but insisted I had just said I wanted a threesome. 

Pause. I was sober, and I‚Äôm very uninterested in having a threesome yet alone with a sex worker. He literally wanted to make me feel crazy. I got up to leave and he pinned me down. Then he went and grabbed a ziplock of coke and snorted it. He didn‚Äôt let me leave, and constantly said the escort was on their way. 

Then I noticed the persons name was stored with the letter ts next to it. Yes TS, which means transgender. 

He later forced me to watch tranny porn with him. I felt so sick the whole night. I felt so low, so unwanted, so used. 

The next morning he was still high and showed no emotions when I packed my things up to leave. All he could say was he didn‚Äôt recall anything I said that happened. 

Then he said he was sorry the next day, and I said how can you be sorry for something you won‚Äôt even acknowledge that happened. 

I blocked him and don‚Äôt want anything to do with him. The only thing is I‚Äôm scared for him, he is in the marijuana business and is well off financially. I‚Äôm scared bc his access to money he‚Äôll never get help and continue to use but will fall deeper and deeper. I keep thinking what if he overdosed, or catches an incurable disease from wreck-less sex. I‚Äôm 29 he was a youthful 50 didn‚Äôt look his age. I do feel like with him being 50 that he didn‚Äôt just start this habit that I was too blind to see that he was an addict long before he met me. I feel like he used me for outside appearances, amongst his social life. When we were first dating he would say obnoxious stuff like I pay for girls to blo and go that he could care less about being stuck in a relationship. But later would say it was a joke. 

I haven‚Äôt eaten in three days. No appetite. Very sad. 

This just shows me all the obnoxious behavior in public was bc he‚Äôs on coke. For example Sunday we went to farmers market he bought peanuts, then we went to gelsons and he literally cracked his peanuts and through the shells on the markets floor. That‚Äôs not normal behavior. It all makes sense to me now. 

Am I stupid for worrying about his well being even though he clearly never cared about me?

He hasn‚Äôt even tried to reach out not saying I would talk to him. Just hurts more knowing he doesn‚Äôt regret anything.",1,1584841867,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fmro47/found_out_my_now_ex_is_a_coke_addict/,AskMen,1

I matched with this girl the other night on Tinder, and we had a lot in common (we even went to the same high school). It was the only back-and-forth conversation I've had on Tinder that lasted for hours. We agreed that there are some TV shows that we wanted to watch together... but there's the whole social distancing thing. I gave her my number, and we've been texting fairly regularly since.

What I've been wondering is, what's the best way to keep this up without it sizzling out? Should I slow down the texts? Think of something creative? Since we wanted to watch TV together, I was thinking of using the Netflix Party extension for Chrome, but I have some speech impediments (mild stutter and some mumbling; it's a lot worse when I'm nervous, which I would be), so to be honest I'd rather the first time we actually talk be in-person.

But that's the problem. He would ""eat"" me for an hr and I don't finish, even giving directions, whereas my previous partner made me finish in about 10 minutes. He doesn't know how to use his fingers either, even with directions, whereas I can finish myself in 5 minutes. With all of this, his pp is about 3-4 inches, and it's just, well it's small. I don't feel pleasure in any way, so I kinda just gave up.

He's a 5""11 man, big hands and feet, I was hoping for maybe a 5-6, but I'm just so unsatisfied and I don't have the heart to tell him. I don't know if I should just live with it, since making love is just, well that, it's no big deal. I don't want to crush him, but doing it is just the most boring thing, I always just end up finishing myself. 

I really don't know what to do, he's the most amazing man I've ever been with and treats me like a queen, but I feel, in my love life, unhappy. I can't tell him how I feel because he's been treated like crap before, I don't want to hurt his self-esteem. And I can't justify breaking up with someone because of sex. I feel I should just live with it, since in every other aspect I'm blessed with his kindness and compassion for me. :/",17,1584803892,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fmgi3r/my_partner_has_a_very_small_pp_and_i_dont_know/,AskMen,1

fmfoyo,badaboobadabing,How do I get over of feeling that I have to be perfect if I ever wanna be in a relationship again,"So a lil bit of backstory. 

I met this girl when I was 22 and she was 17. (I had few relationships before her but never fell in love with a girl I was with) We instantly connected and had an awesome relationship untill we did not. When I hit 25 I started a new stressfull job. Bought a car etc  (all grown up stuff) It was fine for a year but then I kind of lost myself. My goals ,my purpose. I was stressed all the time, always having negative thoughts ,started hating myself(I gained weight ,my hair started thinning,I was too much into politics and shit I cant control)anrgy all the time,complacent in a relationship and took her for granted.

All of that while she was still in college and didnt want to think about ""grown up"" problems and I was swarming her with my shit. Dont get me wrong she was not perfect either and she made tons of mistakes just like I did but here I wanna talk about me and my mistakes.

Anyway she broke up with me due to losing feelings and even though I didnt want to breakup I understood her choice. I tried giving her some time and contacting her but she didnt want anything to do with me anymore. She stared dating a new guy a month after a breakup and I dont have any contact with her but I think she is still with him.(not important but just want you to see its not a rebound like many would say)

Now to the important part. Here I am  27 years of age, 9 months after a breakup of 4 and a 1/2 years relationship . I wouldnt say Im completely healed and fine but Im doing ok. I started working out , got some new hobbies like cycling ,reading. I stopped giving a shit about things I cant control. Im taking care of myself better, Im dressing better and I got a new group of awesome friends. 

But even all that cant fill the void I feel and Im not sure if I will ever feel whole again. Im still blaming mostly myself for the relationship ending and I dont think I've fully forgave myself and probably never will. Also I did meet some new girls but I just dont care about getting to know them and starting a relationship all over from a scratch because Im scared Im gonna repeat my mistakes and fuck up again.

I have this feeling deep down inside me that I have to be perfect before I ever get into a relationship again and I dont know how to get over that. Im scared of getting into a relationship with someone again just to hurt them because I dont think Im good enough to be with.

What can I do to stop feeling like this , to break out of this loop that Im in.",21,1584800566,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fmfoyo/how_do_i_get_over_of_feeling_that_i_have_to_be/,AskMen,1

fmeqvf,Taeolian,When in a relationship do you ever seek outside perspective when conflicts arise?,"Hello all,

Just curious about how some of you guys deal with relationship troubles.

I was just reading an article titled ""What NOT to do when you‚Äôre having relationship problems"".

The advice is to not talk to your friends and family about relationship issues. I'll give you an example of when I went against this advice.

In  2018 I dated a girl for almost a year. 6 months or so into dating we  talked about going away on a road trip somewhere north. Neither of us  had a car living in the city so I was going to rent a car.

I  had done all the planning and booked the rental car and Airbnb  accommodations. Unfortunately, about a day before we were suppose to go  away, I got a phone call from the Car rental company and had realized  while on the phone with them that my UK driver's license would not be  valid in Canada anymore.  


I had mistakenly thought it would be fine as I  had rented cars with it in the past but that's because your license is  only good for a certain period of time. Once you've lived there for long  enough you need to exchange your license for the local one. I didn't know this.  I had to  break the news to my partner that the trip was canceled/postponed but I  said I really wanted to spend time together that weekend and I'd take  her to a nice restaurant. I was very apologetic and felt terrible about it. I promised her I was working on converting my  license ASAP and we'd go away at the next opportunity.

Unfortunately  this wasn't enough for my ex-gf and I got the silent treatment for about a week. That caused me a lot of stress and anxiety actually and I  ended up binge drinking and feeling really sad and guilty about  everything.  


I had never experienced this kind of thing before and I  started talking to my friends about it (checking in to see what they  thought about her behavior, was it justified?) I needed to get some  outside perspective.

I felt in my  gut that she was acting very cold toward me given that I had made a  mistake but at the same time, if I talked to someone I trusted and they said ""well  she has a point"" then I'd be open to reflecting on that more. It sounds  like all I wanted was confirmation and validation but the truth is I  was actually just inexperienced and I was venting and wanted to see what  other's thought as I do like to canvas while forming my own opinion on certain things.

I think I'm just the kind of guy who turns to his friends in times like that. Anyway, it  certainly changed some of  my friend's attitude toward my gf after that. That was never my intention or something I thought about at the time but is something I am aware if now.  


My partner and I made up after the silent treatment but somehow  she knew that I had talked to my friend's about the whole thing. I don't  know how she knew but she did and she was extremely angry about it.

There  was another incident too in which she acted in a way that made my jaw  hit the floor and I was shocked at how I was being treated. I  talked to my two closest friends about it and surprise surprise they  completely sided with me (the article I read touches on how you'd always expect  your friends and family to take your side).

I'm thinking about this article, and I'm thinking about what I do in the future should thing kind of thing happen again.

What's  your opinion on this? Do you talk to your friend's about relationship  troubles? Do you want to get outside perspectives? Or, do you leave your  relationship issues completely private and only keep yourself and  partner involved. I'm really interested about this and I think my stance  has changed on the whole thing. I would not so easily involve other  people in my issues in the future.

I  think my ex-gf certainly had a point in that our relationship should be  100% private and I did notice a change in behavior from my friends  toward her after a few stories I told them.

Are  there ever any circumstances in which you do want outside perspective  though? Have you ever told your friends or family about relationship  issues and then regretted it? Or do you feel like in certain scenarios  it can be healthy to check in with others that you trust to see what they think.

  


TLDR;  What is your opinion on turning to friends or family members when you and your partner have an argument or fight? Do you like to get other people's perspective as a way of resolving the issue or do you believe that relationship issues should always be 100% private?",8,1584796284,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fmeqvf/when_in_a_relationship_do_you_ever_seek_outside/,AskMen,1

fmeqt0,hackindarts9,Do you regret buying things you can't fully afford?,"I love bikes. I fell in love with the two wheeled beauties when I spent 3 years of my life in Vietnam teaching English. I had a bike there for daily commuting. Now back home (Canada), I told myself I need a bike for summer riding. Seems like each year I get a push back into this plan. 

Year one: I went to a specialized school and couldn't save much since my availability to work was limited between studying and the classroom. 

Year two: spent the money, got the license (a long, expensive, and tedious task in the province of Qu√©bec). By the time that process was finished with, it was August and riding season was pretty much over with.

Year three: This is the year. I have worked full time, saved up the cash, I have my license, I am good to go. NOPE! covid 19 has truly fucked me. I work as an audio Visual technician for live events and allllll events are canceled.

Now... I have savings. But the bike will run them dry. And there's no work in sight. I'm on Ei so there's some money coming in but not much.

fmeqmv,xdMeep,What have y‚Äôall been doing to keep fit now that gyms are closed?,"Typically, I would go to a climbing gym to keep in shape. Now that COVID-19 has closed those gyms, I no longer know what to do to stay in shape. I‚Äôve tried youtube video exercises and running outside. To be honest, I‚Äôm not amazing at running, and would prefer to work on another area of my body; as well, the youtube videos seem to be long and unengaging. I like rock climbing to keep fit since i‚Äôm a nerd and like to use my brain while I exercise, and climbing combines both leg/arm strength with quick decision making. 

Sorry if it just seems like i‚Äôm a picky teenager. It would be great if you commented how I can motivate myself to use either of those tools, or commented what other options I have.

fmb85a,Bluesheets4,How can I minimize the damage to feelings hurt when it comes to ending things with my friend?," 

I don't know where or how this is going to start, but if this gets picked up by anyone that would be great.

I have known my friend for a while now and not until a couple months ago did we start to get close, where we would spend a lot of time together. We started to become really close friends and just all and all started to get closer. Mind you I never expected things to get to the point to where they are now. After these few months I started to develop feelings for them. In the beginning it was great and just saw myself or possibly saw myself with them, but come these past few weeks its become apparent that I don't see myself with them for the long term which if I were to get into a relationship that is what I would want I should add that when I revealed that I had feelings for them they revealed to me that they have liked me for years.

There are times when we talk where there isn't any conversation. I realize that I know that I do not see myself with them because there are times where I find myself not so much dreading talking to them on the phone but just the wanting to talk to them is not there. The feeling of just not being happy is there and wanting to end things is there. Don't get me wrong, I loved our friendship dynamic but now that there is a relationship dynamic it has shown me that this is not the person for me. It becomes sticky because I am friends with a lot of their relatives as well. So, I know if I end this I will or could possibly be losing more close friends and that is what gets me.

I guess I just have one question here

How do I state that I want to end the relationship dynamic in a manner that is the least damaging? I know that's really hard to do but I have never done something like this and this is just causing a lot of anxiety.

TL;DR- Have a really close friend that I have known for years, and started to develop feelings for them. Revealed that she has liked me for years. In the beginning it was solid and now it has shown that I don't see myself in a relationship with them when at the same time they do want a relationship, I just don't know how to tell them that I don't want the same thing as them with as little damage?

fm9aze,AppletreeObservatory,How to deal with having been used for Sex?,"This just happened two days ago (corona corona I know and I may not always make the smartest decisions).

So a couple weeks ago I met this friend of my flatmate and started to get some she likes me vibes. I can be a bit straight to the point and I quickly developed a crush that night so I asked her number and two days later we met for a beer or two at the bar.
Saying bye turned into what I can only describe as the most Horny and intimate ""hug"" I have experienced so far without doing anything more then well... hugging. A couple days later followed ""date two"" and me having already been quite flirty the first time round and hating to dick around told her I got a crush on her which quickly turned into a quick non kissing makeout session which was stopped by her suddenly having a change of heart and sending me home. She later wrote that she's sorry but she doesn't have the same feeling towards me ect.  although I was bit confused due to the sudden change of heart ect.

 I handled it quite well, wasn't too emotionally involved and would have been totally fine with just chilling as friends in the future which due to her being friends with my flatmate would have occurred eventually either way. Also due to moving quite quick it wasn't too much of a disappointment (pro tip get results quick that way. It hurts less and you haven't invested too much emotional energy).

Cut to three days ago when due to corona becoming more of an issue she came over to visit us for a small scale no outside no unknown contacts cooking and beer session which I fully expected to remain just that and she starts eyeing me, suddenly starts pulling me in for one of those hugout sessions and a couple drinks later the location has changed to the bedroom with me thinking she may have had a change of heart and I mightve simply not giving her enough space prior and moved too quickly...

She left the following noon after lots of cuddling and brunch and I didn't feel it necessary to have ""that talk"" immediately. 
I mean after all that was said and done I didn't deem it necessary.

So to the point that night she wrote that shes sorry yada yada she didn't have any feelings still was too drunk ect.

Well this time being dumped does sting and I feel pretty much used and am considering not to go the Confess feelings early route in the future because that shit sucks right now.",21,1584764662,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fm9aze/how_to_deal_with_having_been_used_for_sex/,AskMen,1

fm7hsm,howaboutneehaw,Why do so many young men struggle to call out other men's wrongdoings?,"For example my brother is somebody who let so much slide for his buddies(who he didn't like and complained about yet hung out with constantly and befriended anyway). For example he told me how this one guy in our neighborhood always cat calls with girls and it makes them so uncomfortable when I told him I was cat called and he said 'yeah it happens that guy did it'. When I asked him why in the fuck he didn't say anything to this guy he said 'well what was I supposed to say it was awkward'. Um okay... It's one of the reasons why I will cut him out of my life when I move out and become independent (he hasn't changed and has a very toxic mentality towards other men. He is nearing 30 and I can't deal with his insecure disgusting self and one of the biggest reasons being shit like this. He is a coward and doesn't stand up for what's right). 

I found out that a ton of young guys are like this. It's toxic and it seems to be a thing amongst guys more than girls (at least where I'm from, girls get judged for the friends they have and their reputation becomes tainted faster when they befriend bad girls than when guys befriend other bad people).

Another example is I had to distance myself from a male friend who I genuinely liked and wanted to befriend recently, because he befriends horrendous people and lowkey admitted to me he kind of acknowledges that they're bad people but doesn't do anything about it.

Why do many young men especially struggle with this? Why is it okay to let shit slide for your buddies? I think to me it signals a bit of immaturity. I would never be able to be friends with people with bad behavior or especially if I saw something bad happen in front of me, I wouldn't be able to let it go.",54,1584756458,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fm7hsm/why_do_so_many_young_men_struggle_to_call_out/,AskMen,1

fm3wtx,katariana444,How do you show a girl you really like her?,"I posted a similar question in a different forum, but I wanted to ask straight from guys.

As a woman (I dont know if this happens as a man) (oh and a straight woman) if you start talking to, or seeing someone, its very easy to write off anything seemingly positive they do that would indicate 'real' interest as ""he could be doing this with 10 girls"". Or even simpler, 'ok that doesnt chalk up to anything'. 

Texting you good morning/daily, saying they are looking something serious - a lot of things are also used as lines by men who dont mean them at all. 

And Ive seen both sides. A male friend (speaking about his wife) 'oh i made it very clear I liked her' then asking the wife 'he didnt'. A different male friend who had 8 girlfriends at the same time, all who thought he was being exclusive. 

So, guys, this may have been asked a lot before, but, if you really, truly like a girl, does it differ in how you act vs a girl you only want to hookup with or dont like? How do your actions change? Is there anything you specifically do(all guys are different) that means its real that she would pick up on?",0,1584742529,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fm3wtx/how_do_you_show_a_girl_you_really_like_her/,AskMen,1

fm2czf,thecatsmeow2003,How do I get my husband to discuss ED?,"My husband (63M) and I (45F) have been together seven years and married for a little over four. He developed ED shortly after our wedding, and we haven‚Äôt been intimate in any way for four years. 

No hugging or kissing (other than a quick peck here and there). No hand holding. No cuddling. Basically no physical touch at all. I‚Äôve always been a very physical person, and my prior relationships always involved a healthy amount of sex. I don‚Äôt know how to cope with this. 

He refuses to discuss it in any way, no matter how gently I bring it up. When I try to put my arm around him in bed at night, he pulls away. I know everyone says a woman shouldn‚Äôt blame herself or feel unattractive, but he won‚Äôt even kiss me or hug me. 

Years ago I talked him into couples counseling, but it didn‚Äôt go well. He just sat there saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù when I asked him why he wouldn‚Äôt even show me the slightest bit of physical affection‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even care about intercourse or penetration. He refused to do anything the therapist recommended. After a few appointments, therapist finally said she was at a loss and couldn‚Äôt help us. 

I‚Äôve stopped bringing it up more than once a year or so. Last night was really hard. I told him that I felt I wasn‚Äôt good enough for him. He looked at me, rolled over, and went to sleep. I went to the living room and spent the next three hours crying in the dark. 

I wish he would talk about it. I can only guess how he feels. Maybe if we had an open conversation, we would at least feel a little better about our situation. 

Is there any way I can encourage him to talk to me?",26,1584736947,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fm2czf/how_do_i_get_my_husband_to_discuss_ed/,AskMen,1

I try not to think about her, but because we've remained friends we sometimes talk and I just can't cut any connection with her. The quarantine in my country will probably help for that though. The thing is that sometimes I might see her with her new BF and I always feel like me blood is boiling and rushing up to my head and it ruins my day, even if I haven't thought about the situation at all. I know it's her choice to be with him and at the end of the day I honestly want her to be happy, and I know she wants me to be happy as well, but her new BF is an old ex of her.

The last panic attack I had was last year towards March so it‚Äôs been a while and I went through it all by myself and it eventually went away but it was a horrible couple months so I‚Äôm just wondering if I should talk to someone about it and tell them all my fears at the moment or will that make it worst and blow the issues far greater.

If you liked a girl who was bigger than you, would you still enjoy her sitting on your lap?
I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend (26M) for a year and a half, and I've never sat on his lap. He and I are about the same height but I do weigh more than him. Not by a ton, but it is noticeable, and most of the weight is in my butt/thighs. I've never sat on any guy's lap, because I am a bigger girl and I'm always worried I'm going to crush them (which would be so embarrassing for me in addition to potentially painful for them).  I've heard guys say that unless girls sit like, directly on their balls somehow, or on their stomach, it's comfortable and the weight is distributed evenly enough that it isn't painful at all, but I was just curious what other guys thought about it.

flzpk6,LeHai82,How do you deal with this level of illogical?,"Story: So me and the gf are having a convo, possibly a common one idk,  about what people are paid in different jobs, my comment was, ""well people are generally paid according to how many people society thinks can do their job, so doctors get more than nurses and retail is pretty poor""

So far, so good. Then she says how nurses shouldn't have to pay back student loans to which i reply that they dont unless their earnings pass the threshold. Thats when shit hit the fan. She flipped and said I don't value nurses (not true) and i dont think they are valuable to society (also not true).

At this point i stupidly assumed reason may work so i politely reminded her of what I'd ACTUALLY said and said it was absurd to assume that I don't value nurses based on that.

She then launched into complete irrelevancy, about how i was being an asshole (for answering her question) and bringing up everything except the fact i pulled my dogs tail when i was 2 (dont think i did but can't be certain). I then made the fatal mistake of saying ""well actually it's you thats being the asshole"" and reminded her again what I'd said.

So now I'm being punished for trying to answer a question that clearly had no right answer. I say punished , she isn't talking to me, which is kinda a win in a way since I ended with ""don't ask me any more questions"", except it definitely won't be the end of it cos my apparent assholeness and life history will carry over to the next character assassination /argument .

My question is how else do I deal with this cos its probably every argument right now, she can never just argue the point. I'm nearly at the point of breakup because all her qualities are dwarfed by the fact she argues like my teenage son. If she sees this it will be world war three instead of making her think how childish she acts when she thinks I disagree with her....",0,1584727873,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/flzpk6/how_do_you_deal_with_this_level_of_illogical/,AskMen,1

fly4jk,Shamwambler,Do you feel an overwhelming amount of crushing guilt when ending a relationship? How do you deal with it?," 

TLDR: Do you feel immense guilt when breaking up with someone and if so, how do you forgive yourself/move on? Also, how can I minimize the pain I cause my partner if I do break up with them?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over two years and after many months of having serious problems, I think I've finally come to the decision that I'm no longer happy in the relationship. Whenever I imagine us getting married and spending the rest of our lives together I feel anxious and even get a sense of dread rather than feeling excited and eager the way I used to. Additionally, there is a long list of issues that I think are strong signs we aren't right for each other.

We don't really have any common interests to speak of, we mostly just eat dinner and watch movies/shows together at this point. There was a time when I was fine with this because we still got along well and were happy together. I read somewhere that common interests are fun, but strong relationships are built on common values. I think I still agree with this, but I'm not really even sure if my girlfriend and I have common values. She gets mad and upset over things that don't really bother me, we have some views on the world that we disagree with heavily on, she says ""I wish we were like these couples that go to protests together"" regarding things I don't really believe in, things like that.

On top of that, her and my friends don't get along at all. My best friend and my girlfriend have got some totally different beliefs, and I've developed close relationships with both of them despite the fact that they're completely different people because I just kind of tend to be a more passive person. I agree with her that my best friend can be a dick sometimes, but I've known him for about 15 years and I know he isn't a bad person. In fact, there have been times when he's been there for me when other people haven't and been extremely supportive. Anyway, it's gotten to a point where I haven't seen my friends in person in 7 months. We've played some games online together a few times but that's about it, and these are guys that I've known since I was in middle school. Naturally, this is making me extremely depressed. Honestly, I'm lucky that they still consider me to be their friend at all.

On top of THAT I now have a hard time getting and staying aroused for her, and we're in our early twenties. While I do still think she is very physically attractive, whenever I look at her now I can't help but think of all the fights that we always have, how mad I've made her before, and how there are times where I've just brought out the worst in her. It makes me shun away from intimacy almost immediately.

These are some of the reasons why I just don't think I want to be in the relationship anymore. However, I'm getting really terrified of going through with actually breaking up with her. Things were, and still are, very serious. I even gave her a promise ring for our first anniversary and we talked about getting married and moving in together, this all being before she met my friends and before we developed these problems. In hindsight, it was a bad move to let things get serious so quickly, but we were each other's first relationship and we were both really inexperienced. I truly was very in love with her and meant it when I said I wanted to eventually get married, I just had no idea that things would get so bad over the course of our second year together.

I've been reading a lot of posts on [r/breakups](https://www.reddit.com/r/breakups/) and they seem to all be written by people that have been broken up with, rather than by people that have initiated a break up. There are a lot of common themes in these posts: They all hate their exes for letting things get so serious and then calling things off, they hate their exes for blindsiding them with a break up, they hate their exes for moving on after the break up, etc. I guess I wouldn't be totally blindsiding her with a breakup, I told her a couple months ago that I can't commit to moving in with her anymore and last year she actually tried to break us up twice. The first time I was able to convince her not to break up and the second time I was willing to let it happen but after about a day she called me saying she wanted me to come over and she ended up changing her mind. But she still has the promise ring and is under the impression that as of now, things are good and that we'll probably move in together eventually. I still have love for her so I don't want her to remember me as her asshole ex that dumped her out of nowhere, and I'll absolutely feel guilty forever for breaking her heart. I guess my question is, have you guys ever experienced such guilt from breaking up with an ex? And if so, how were you able to forgive yourself and deal with your feelings? Additionally, what are some ways I can hurt her the least amount possible? I don't think she's a bad person at all, in fact I genuinely hope that me and her can still be friends even if we aren't together anymore, and I want her to be happy.

Sorry for the long post, I've had a lot to get off my chest.",14,1584722447,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fly4jk/do_you_feel_an_overwhelming_amount_of_crushing/,AskMen,1
