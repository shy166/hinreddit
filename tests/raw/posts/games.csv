fsnrej,Mrmoi356,"Despite all the pretty big releases this past month, Persona 5: Royal looks to be the best","I'm prefacing by saying I haven't played it yet and am going of what others have said and this post is mostly to let people know that the original game is not the same as Royal because I have seen lot's of people everywhere saying that it's just a cashgrab that should have been in the original game.

I'll start by saying that if you never played Persona 5 you should go play Royal right now and avoid the rest of my post, the game in its original form was amazing but with Royal it may just be one of the greatest of all time. If you're worried that the story is changed by a lot compared to the original don't be, the main storyline doesn't have major changes besides combat and mechanical stuff. Also if you're worried that you won't like it because it's a JRPG then I wouldn't be that worried about it, I'm not that into JRPG's in general but Persona 5 and Persona in general is different.

In terms of changes, you don't have a reworked combat system by any means but you have some amazing improvements. With Persona's you have Persona traits, they are simply put different traits that give each Persona a special ability that could change how you would normally play with the Persona.

The other big combat change is with Baton passes, they are a lot different now. Firstly you have stages with Baton passes, with every stage the person you passed the Baton too will gain hp and sp(I may be wrong about sp tho) and if you get stage 3 the person can do any move without using any sp or hp cost. There are also ranks, these are earned by playing darts in the new area they added, 3 ranks in total and they give different boosts at every rank which quite amazing.

Also my personal favorite change in the combat is the Showtime graphics which are amazing, even better than the All Out attack ones.

Minor changes with combat is that lots of Personas have been re-balanced and you restock with ammo automatically.

You also have reworked Palaces, and I mean reworked. They are very different at certain points and at some points are completely different. Lots of the bosses are different especially Madrame who has a brand new stage, there are new stuff to do while in the palaces such as collecting Will Seeds and using a bloody grappling hook. They are very different, I don't want to spoil much but they are very different from the original.

The biggest changes are to Mementos, you have a lot new stuff in Mementos that make them much better which is really good because that was probably the worst part in the game. You have a new NPC that can be used to upgrade stuff like money earned, exp earned and etc and you also lots of QOL of life changes, once again not going into much detail here because it could get quite spoilery.

The stuff above is just some major changes but there is a lot more I didn't add, but that's not all because there is lots of NEW content. You have two new confidants, one with a new Phantom Thieves member, you have a brand new area which is really damn good and you get a brand new semester along with a new palace which adds roughly 30 more hours of content.

That's all the major stuff added and reworked but I think it's worth mentioning that there is also worked on the base story quite a bit and reworked lots of major plot holes that existed and added some new scenes and arcs to the base game, they also reworked almost all the confidants as well.

Hopefully that wall text was enough to convince someone who was on fence about the game because they were worried that it's too similar to the original.

Oh and one more thing that little shit Morgana doesn't tell you to sleep anymore so that alone should be worth price of admission.",27,1585696706,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fsnrej/despite_all_the_pretty_big_releases_this_past/,Games,0

Biped is a puzzle platformer in which you control one of two adorable robots.  This control is in the form of moving individual legs based of off mouse buttons and movements. The levels can vary wildly from the simple tutorials and initial levels to the no holds barred ""pro"" levels. 

I recently picked a copy of this game up and within an hour I was hooked, I insisted my friend buy it and we spent hours going through the main levels and having a blast. 

If you have the time spare I would highly recommend giving it a shot and helping it to gain the attention it deserves",11,1585695503,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fsneyy/the_adorably_fun_puzzle_platformer_youve_probably/,Games,0

I played through Doom2016 on PS4, and all the time I'm thinking ""this is f\*cking brillliant, but I so wish I was able to play it properly!"". I'm not putting myself through that again. This makes me so sad, as I cannot justify the cost of a high end PC for games, so I won't be playing this. That means I'm not going to buy it either. It would have been an instant purchase with K&amp;B support!

We've got a great crew of gamers and non-gamers and a load of us used to play 7 days to die together which we loved. We're now looking for some more games and specifically game modes we might enjoy. We don't really want to be playing against other people either team-based against each other or team against computer.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, we've got on the list Minecraft, Garry's mod and unturned. All games that don't need beefy PC's and all games with mods. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for advice on specific mods (never played Minecraft or Gmod) and game modes for them. Or any other game you think may work. There will be upwards of 10 people at a time.

fsb6j9,belarskio,I really dont like the way Minecraft is heading,"Im probably going to get a lot of hate for this but just hear me out. Most of these new updates that are scheduled for Minecraft are just gimmicks in my opinion and  just serve to bring people back for a week and leave or to appeal to small children. Dont get me wrong, I dont dislike the updates but the people who actually stick around for the game and play a lot truly dont care about the updates and the devs time would be better spent adding stuff that truly brings more to the game. The reason they are doing this is because the people who pay more are the players who come back for a short period of time because they buy skin packs and possibly new ports of the games while the people who really like the game bought all they are going to buy for the most part. Also small children buy a lot of texture packs and skin packs. The reason its so effective is because a good portion of the community just came back temporarily. Dont get me wrong I dont dislike those players I just dislike what Minecraft is doing, Goats? Termites? Pandas?(yes im aware pandas are from a while ago) Really? Examples of really good updates are Village and Pillage, aquatic, end update, Adventure update. Those updates really brought stuff to the game while these ones are mainly just things you look at once and go, hmm interesting and move on. I am certainly not insulting anyone because I am fine with temporary players, small children and people who just generally like the new updates but Im just saying my opinions.

In other words these new updates bring nothing to the game and I really dont like them except for a couple exceptions.",33,1585653629,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fsb6j9/i_really_dont_like_the_way_minecraft_is_heading/,Games,1

fs79q7,Wrathnfury,Strategy games (RTS),"Sorry if this is against rules didn't see anything linking to it.


My brother and I play Supreme Commander currently as a strategy game, but I feel like the computer is pretty obnoxious meaning medium/normal is just super easy, but hard just is a swarm fest, and having to make customs every match doesn't help either.   I also feel like there is little to no strategy involved with the game just a who can build an army bigger and faster which gets boring.

My brother is ok at strategy not great as he is a ""I need to be ready before I can help or attack"" sort of guy which is easy to exploit and constantly leans on me as an early defensive player.  


I have played star wars galactic battleground (love it, but graphics are just meh now no offense to the game but it is outdated).  Supreme Commander 2, WC2&amp;3, SC2, and a LOTR one I can't remember what it was called but I loved it (might have same graphics issue as star wars one now though no idea)

And some less ""smash of rage the keyboard"" games like Shovel Knight too!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqEy7BB5DNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqEy7BB5DNk) 

I have also been paying some attention for brazilian indie games, since I'm from Rio de Janeiro. And it just launched for PS4 a Dog/Ninja/Samurai style platform game, it feels like a late 80s game, and it's really good. It's called Dogurai  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEfx7dzgQww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEfx7dzgQww) 

It's great to see how the gaming market is growing here. 10-15 years ago we couldn't even expect a game to come in Portuguese, and now we are making our own games! Unfortunately, most of those companies are in Brasilia. I met some brazilians developers on my trip to our Supreme Court, while I was in the city. They work with pretty small groups, but I think that is what makes those games special - everyone seems so into their project, and that must be true for any indie game developer around the world!

fry66x,MugetsuTV,How This Game´s Mystery Remains Unsolved For Over 14 Years,"  

Hey, I´ll try my best to summarize this as good as possible.

There was a game released over 15 years ago, with the name “Perplex City” (Some of you might have heard of it). It´s pretty much an Alternate Reality Game and there was even a big cash prize for the first one to beat it. It combines reality with virtuality to tell a story. Basically, you had 256 cards and you needed to solve all of them to get a full map (each card contained one map piece). With that map, you could track down a cube called the Receda Cube. The award for finding that cube were 200.000 dollars. Someone actually found the cube. I´ll attach a photo of that below. He pretty much was just lucky to find the cube, he didn´t solve all of the cards to find it. He was more or less just 10 meters away from it and just happened to find it. 

Most of the cards were still solved from the game, but two of them remain unsolved until to date. The card 238 is just unsolvable, no clue why they added that in, but card 256 appears to be solvable, according to the creators of the game. The card is called “Billion to One” and contains a picture of a japanese looking dude. 

He has jet black hair, he’s wearing a scarf, a black peacoat, there’s a river, some old European looking buildings and a hill behind him. Further, there is another hint: “My name is Satoshi”. I posted a picture of that card below. Since then, 14 years have passed and no one knows who and where that Satoshi guy is, which is beyond unimaginable. You have a picture and the name of the guy and his whereabouts still remain unknown. It´s also not like that this game didn´t get enough attention, it definetly did. This mystery was shown multiple times in the news, hundreds of thousands of people tried to investigate it, but Satoshi is nowhere to be found.

There are a couple of leads regarding this entire mystery. I tried my best to take everything into consideration in my video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbL1g-cLfxk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbL1g-cLfxk)), but there is still no new lead regarding this entire thing. The newest thing (according to the creators of the game) is that the guy is supposedly in Los Angeles (or was there).

This topic regained a lot of attention through a YouTuber called “Inside a Mind”, who released a video reviving this entire mystery. His video is kind of uncritical, but he elaborates his opinion and viewpoint in the comment section, I guess.

The topic is overall extremly interesting and I thought I may as well share it. Who knows, maybe you guys know who Satoshi is 😉

frwu5f,teamchuckles,"Splitgate is a fun, well-made free-to-play arena shooter that needs a community.","First off, I have absolutely no stake in the game except that I enjoy playing it and want to turn more people on to it because I'm tired of waiting for long queue times.

If you haven't heard of Splitgate, it's an arena shooter with gunplay and movement very similar to Halo, but it also adds the ability to use portals much like how Valve's Portal uses them. Using portals adds some unique gameplay mechanics and helps prevent things like camping. It makes closed quarter fights more interesting too as you can use portals to confuse your opponents or escape in dangerous situations.

I've been playing on and off since release. The small dev team who makes the game have been supporting it with really good balance updates based on the community's suggestions despite the game achieving quite a low number of players on at any given time (the game gets about 150 players at a time on average). The main reason I haven't played as frequently as other games is because queue times are quite long, probably due to lack of players. Which is why I'm making this post!

If you have already played Splitgate and jumped off the train, give it another shot. They've improved a lot of performance issues and it runs pretty great on my moderate specced machine. I know multiplayer shooters have a lot of competition right now, but most of us have a lot of gaming time right now so hopefully you'll feel compelled to give it a shot! Plus it's free! And join us over at /r/splitgate for lively conversation... mostly about how we wish the community was bigger...

Here is a highlight video that was posted to the sub recently - the editing is a little wonky but it really highlights what high level portal use can look like in this game! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGaXRN-tBo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGaXRN-tBo8)

frt5et,Milohk,I wish Halflife-Alyx was more unique.,"This game feels like valves goal from the top down was to bring halflife to vr. They did it and they polished it to a crazy extent, but I wish it were more unique. Maybe if the story was somewhat intriguing or more unique things happened in the game, I would feel better. The map design and story feel too linear for me. Don't get me wrong, I love the in world details and looking for items. I just feel like the overall game doesn't live up to THE BEST VR GAME EVER MADE (For me that's Pistol Whipped).

I saw valve coming to vr and I thought I would get a completely new experience but this feels like a regular port with slightly more polish.

&gt;""A good title and enjoyable but very short and its replayability is limited greatly. The MP wasn't working even on day one and the beta MP was preventable. Not bad just not as excellent as RE 2""

&gt;Resident Evil 3 joins its forbearer as another top notch remake. I'm happy to see what Capcom has been doing with the series and wonder where they'll take it next.

**[Critical Hit](https://opencritic.com/outlet/299/critical-hit)** - [Darryn Bonthuys](https://opencritic.com/critic/1229/darryn-bonthuys) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.criticalhit.net/review/resident-evil-3-review/)

&gt;Resident Evil 3 Remake continues to the raise the bar of what it means to be a remake. It can feel rushed in places, but the sheer terror of Nemesis and the return to form of Jill Valentine makes it an experience you don't want to miss. Just be sure to bring extra clean underwear along for the ride.

**[Cultured Vultures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/537/cultured-vultures)** - [Jimmy Donnellan](https://opencritic.com/critic/4140/jimmy-donnellan) - [8 / 10](https://culturedvultures.com/resident-evil-3-pc-review/)

&gt;Resident Evil 3 is a mostly superb remake of a horror classic with many clever spins on the formula and fluid, enthralling gameplay. I just wish there was more of it.

&gt;The remake of Resident Evil 3 is going to be divisive, just as the original was.

-------------

**[EGM](https://opencritic.com/outlet/38/egm)** - [Mollie L Patterson](https://opencritic.com/critic/167/mollie-l-patterson) - [8 / 10](https://egmnow.com/resident-evil-3-review/)

&gt;It was always a long shot that a new take on Resident Evil 3 was going to be able to live up to the expectations set by 2019's Resident Evil 2 remake, and that's exactly the case here. Still, beyond a few examples of missed potential, this is another stellar attempt by Capcom to bring its survival horror series into the modern era, and retains a sense of individuality and personality that make it stand out from its peers.

-------------

**[Game Informer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer)** - [Ben Reeves](https://opencritic.com/critic/1036/ben-reeves) - [9 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/resident-evil-3/resident-evil-3-review-a-relentless-terror)

&gt;This is another spectacular remake for the series, and Nemesis is an imposing enemy who relentlessly chases you throughout the game.

-------------

**[GameSpew](https://opencritic.com/outlet/408/gamespew)** - [Richard Seagrave](https://opencritic.com/critic/2754/richard-seagrave) - [9 / 10](https://www.gamespew.com/2020/03/resident-evil-3-review/)

&gt;In terms of thrills and spills, Resident Evil 3 offers what is perhaps the best Resident Evil campaign ever.

-------------

**[GameWatcher](https://opencritic.com/outlet/295/gamewatcher)** - [Gavin Herman](https://opencritic.com/critic/4343/gavin-herman) - [8 / 10](http://www.gamewatcher.com/reviews/resident-evil-3-remake-review/13171)

&gt;Resident Evil 3's remake might not be as surprising as REmake 2, but it is still a fun ride. If you loved the way REmake 2 used the survival horror formula, that same formula continues here with a cool multiplayer mode to boot. If you can forgive some tedious boss fights, a somewhat lacking Nemesis, and some monetization in Resistance, it's got what we love about Resident Evil as a franchise.

-------------

**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Johnny Hurricane](https://opencritic.com/critic/6599/johnny-hurricane) - [80 / 100](http://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/resident-evil-3-review/)

&gt;While Resident Evil 2 Remake is the better game, Resident Evil 3 still makes for a good time. For those looking to pay a trip to Raccoon City and face off with Nemesis, give it a go.

-------------

**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Shubhankar Parijat](https://opencritic.com/critic/1198/shubhankar-parijat) - [7 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/resident-evil-3-campaign-review-the-fault-in-our-s-t-a-r-s)

&gt;Resident Evil 3 constantly hints at greatness, but never quite reaches the heights of the PS1 original. It's a solid enough game, but not nearly as impressive as other recent Resident Evil titles, and not nearly as good as it could and should have been.

-------------

**[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer)** - [Cory Wells](https://opencritic.com/critic/1240/cory-wells) - [4.5 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&amp;p=370371)

&gt;On its own, the remake of Resident Evil 3 is another hallmark achievement for Capcom. It may not satisfy purists of the original, but there's no reason that fans of what the RE2 remake accomplished won't enjoy this.

-------------

**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - [7 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/30/resident-evil-3-remake-review-last-escape-nemesis-12478834/)

&gt;The source material already had its problems, but this disappointing remake manages to make Resident Evil 3 seem even less inspired than it did originally.

-------------

**[PCGamesN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/169/pcgamesn)** - [Jordan Forward](https://opencritic.com/critic/4578/jordan-forward) - [7 / 10](https://www.pcgamesn.com/resident-evil-3/review)

&gt;Capcom's latest is still one of the better entries to the series, but isn't quite sure if it wants to be po-faced and terrifying or a campy, blockbuster shooter.Jordan Forward

&gt;Resident Evil 3 is another excellent Capcom title. Despite being a little short, it is challenging and encourages the player to finish it more than once. The story remains interesting and the gameplay is basically the same as in Resident Evil 2 Remake with some improvements (which is not a bad thing). The graphics and the sound effects are incredible. To make up for the short single-player campaign, Capcom presents us with the RE Resistance multiplayer, which has an interesting proposal and is a great addition to the package, but its long learning curve can keep some players away.

&gt;Resident Evil 3 is another stunning-looking revamp from Capcom that effortlessly manages to switch between tension-packed moments of genuine horror and bombastic action set pieces. It's just a shame that some questionable changes were made from the original and there isn't more bang for your buck in terms of post-completion content.

&gt;Enter the classic world of survival horror with Capcom's Resident Evil 3 Remake, a retelling that may, or may not, be what you were hoping for.

&gt;Another slam dunk remake from Capcom; one that is faithful while still feeling contemporary and exciting. This is a faster, tighter game than the remake of Resident Evil 2, with a cast of interesting characters and a better flow than the original.

-------------

**[Screen Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/664/screen-rant)** - [4 / 5 stars](https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-review/)

&gt;Resident Evil 3 fails to reach the heights of Resident Evil 2 remake, has a shorter and easier campaign and cuts off some iconic locations like The Clock Tower and Raccoon Park.

&gt;Capcom have done a marvellous job with Resident Evil 3, reviving another of their beloved survival horror classics and making it feel completely fresh once again. Nemesis is back and he's here to smash your face in.

-------------

**[USgamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/66/usgamer)** - [Caty McCarthy](https://opencritic.com/critic/2089/caty-mccarthy) - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/resident-evil-3-review)

&gt;Resident Evil 3 finally repositions its place as not just a true sequel to Resident Evil 2, but as a bridge to Resident Evil 4, both in action and plot. While it streamlines the formula of Resident Evil 2 into something more linear, it's still the best way to dodge through Raccoon City with Jill and Carlos, even with Nemesis always on your tail and the occasional clunkiness here and there. With a breezy runtime, Resident Evil 3 is well worth revisiting. Just maybe not Resident Evil Resistance.

-------------

**[VG247](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247)** - [Kirk McKeand](https://opencritic.com/critic/109/kirk-mckeand) - [3 / 5 stars](https://www.vg247.com/2020/03/30/resident-evil-3-remake-review/)

&gt;It’s still worth playing, but Resident Evil 3 Remake is a step backwards for Capcom, coming off the back of one of the best games of last year. It’s gorgeous to look at, the jump scares will get you, and it’s like stepping into a comfy pair of slippers. But even though your feet are cosy, it never feels like home.

-------------

**[Video Chums](https://opencritic.com/outlet/624/video-chums)** - [Trey Griffeth](https://opencritic.com/critic/6442/trey-griffeth) - [7.5 / 10](https://videochums.com/review/resident-evil-3)

&gt;In the end, Resident Evil 3 suffers from not being as good as its predecessor. It's well-made with likable charismatic protagonists and is quite the roller coaster ride but when compared to the tense full-on survival horror game that preceded it, Resident Evil 3 feels like a step back. Still, if you're a fan and are dying for more, this is a solid game that will undoubtedly scratch that itch.

-------------

**[VideoGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/71/videogamer)** - Josh Wise - [8 / 10](http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/resident-evil-3-review)

&gt;Resident Evil 3 is a play for our imagination as much as our memory. It understands that the fear we felt long ago didn't fade; it took root in our brains and mutated into myth. And this is what it might look like.

-------------

**[Wccftech](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech)** - [Nathan Birch](https://opencritic.com/critic/4372/nathan-birch) - [8.5 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-3/)

&gt;Resident Evil 3 is the franchise's best action-driven entry since the glory days of Resident Evil 4. A beautifully-balanced combination of white-knuckle mayhem and satisfying old-school tension, Resident Evil 3 is compulsively-munchable popcorn entertainment that, unfortunately, disappears all too quickly. If you're looking for value, there are certainly meatier games out there, but few that will leave you licking your fingers as happily as this one.

-------------

**[Windows Central](https://opencritic.com/outlet/515/windows-central)** - [Samuel Tolbert](https://opencritic.com/critic/3579/samuel-tolbert) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.windowscentral.com/resident-evil-3-review)

&gt;While a couple of things could've been tweaked to provide a longer experience, Capcom provides a fantastic survival horror remake that carefully balances the action with the terror. You will fear Nemesis.

-------------

**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2020/3/30/reviews/118755/)

&gt;Resident Evil 3 Remake is slightly disappointing after the stellar Resident Evil 2 Remake. It's still a good game, but its short length and lack of ambition mean that it will constantly be seen as the lesser sibling. The addition of the REsistance online mode should add some value for those who enjoy competitive online play, but the lack of single-player options is disappointing. All in all, it's a good follow-up to an amazing game, and as long as you're willing to forgive its foibles, RE3 Remake should be a fun return to Raccoon City for franchise faithfuls.

-------------

**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Richard Walker](https://opencritic.com/critic/679/richard-walker) - [85 / 100](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/resident-evil-3/review/)

&gt;Short it may be, but Resident Evil 3 is also delightfully sweet. Or as sweet as a survival horror game possibly can be, anyway. Pared back, streamlined and completely brilliant, you'll have a blast outrunning Nemesis all over again.

frr354,rjo1,PSA: Be generous with video game technical support staff,"Support staff for many companies are completely overwhelmed and understaffed for the amount of traffic coming in due to people being stuck at home. 

You may have seen tweets like this one from Playstation where they own up to it but many companies are just trying to overwork what few employees are still available to assist in a timely manner. https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1241824534694637569 

The team I work on, as of this last week has 5x the amount of incoming tickets with half the employees and are absolutely backlogged.

Multiple branches of a company can be temporarily shuttered due to local regions policies on being able to commute to work should working from home not be an option deployed in time, leaving a massive burden on who is still available.

To get to the point: If you have feedback stick to forums, don't go to tickets, a chat or call. Some people actually need assistance with the game and you are just wasting the time of someone who can't influence what you want changed. If you encounter a small bug, while worth reporting - if it doesn't effect your gameplay. Just hold off or forget about it.

**If you do need help, be patient and provide as much information as possible, and don't make multiple tickets - I assure you we're working towards yours.**",1,1585576030,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/frr354/psa_be_generous_with_video_game_technical_support/,Games,1

frqqsp,CodeMilo,Online party games for groups of people during lockdown,"Hello everyone,

I have been in lockdown for the past 2 weeks and while I am personally doing fine, I have many colleagues who live alone and don't have much social interaction apart from job related stuff. In order to try to have as much as fun as possible considering the circumstances, I am planning on doing some private gaming nights so we can all have some time off.

I know that Twitch doesn't allow to have private stream and neither does YouTube so I guess Discord is the best option here. Are there other alternatives?

Now the most important part, ""THE GAMES"". Ideally I am looking for games where only one person needs to own it and the rest participates, like the jackbox party games. Are there more games like this that can be played over the phone where multiple people can participate? Something similar to trivial pursuit?

Thank you all in advance",1,1585574730,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/frqqsp/online_party_games_for_groups_of_people_during/,Games,1
frqnpa,rGamesMods,"Weekly /r/Games Discussion - Meta Monday: Handling ""Announcements of Annoucements"" + Rule Verbiage Updates","Welcome our second Meta Monday thread! We wanted to improve communication between the moderator team and the users of /r/games in an effort to improve the subreddit as a whole. To that end, we've established the Meta Monday threads. We will endeavor to run these Meta Monday threads at least once a month to solicit feedback about an aspect of /r/games that we have concerns about. We may utilize this feedback in making changes that will hopefully improve the subreddit in the long run.

# Announcements of Announcements
Over time we have seen feedback regarding submissions that are ""announcements of announcements"". Here are a few examples:

* [Danganronpa creator Kazutaka Kodaka to announce new title on December 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/e7z9gu/danganronpa_creator_kazutaka_kodaka_to_announce/)
* [Toydea to announce new RPG and eSports titles for PS4, Switch, PC, and smartphones at TGS 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/e067kq/atlus_usa_to_make_persona_5_royal_related/)
* [Atlus USA to Make Persona 5 Royal Related Announcement on Tuesday December 3, 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/cxyq7f/toydea_to_announce_new_rpg_and_esports_titles_for/)

The feedback we often see for this kinds of submissions is that they aren't news or aren't providing any worthwhile discussion. What are your thoughts on announcements of announcements? Do you find value in submissions like these? Let us know!

# Rule Updates 

Nothing major to announce here actually. We've just updated some of the verbiage of our rules to be more clear on what they cover.

&gt; **3.1 No off-topic content or comments** - Submissions should be directly related to games or the gaming industry. Top level comments must be on topic. Lower level comments should be reasonably related to the discussion. The following topics fall under this category and are better suited on other subreddits:

&gt; - Film or television adaptions of games
- Video game retail items such as apparel, toys, and collectibles which have no interaction or integration with a game
- Individual e-sports player or game streamer news
- Career advice
- News regarding game concerts

&gt; Please note that the above list is **NOT** comprehensive and other content may be considered off-topic and will be removed at mod discretion.

This rule has been updated to include a list of some of the content we consider to be off-topic. We have received a lot of feedback about providing a list of off-topic subjects for better submission guidance so we have included a list of some of the higher volume topics we remove. This list is not comprehensive, and we may add items to it over time for additional clarity. To be clear - we are not changing what we consider to be off topic, we are just making some of those items more visible now.

&gt; **6.8 No links to individual sales, only sales events or free game events** - Links directly to a store page or announcement regarding an individual game going on sale (e.g. game is 30% off) are not allowed. However, links to sale event announcements (e.g. Steam Holiday sales, Humble Bundles, flash sales, etc.) are permitted, as are links to free game events (e.g. Free weekends, Games With Gold, PS Plus Free Games, etc). Free game events are considered to be instances where games which are normally sold are either temporarily free or transitioned to permanently free. One submission is permitted for a pre-announcement of a sales/free game event as well as a submission notifying that the event has started. Submissions regarding individually discounted games are more appropriate in subs such as /r/GameDeals. 

The updates to Rule 6.8 are mostly a facelift - the spirit of the rule has always been to prevent flooding of the subreddit with spam about discounts for games which come and go on an hourly basis. In the previous wording we called out exceptions to this rule which were sales events, Humble Bundles free games, or free weekends for games. We updated this rule to clarify that any free game events are permitted in the subreddit and we provided additional examples which are a bit more modern. With this update we also provided a definition of what we consider to be a ""free game event"" as well as limitations to announcements of these events. 


&gt; **Rule 8 - Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments). 

Very slight update/correction here. Around four months ago we had a large rule overhaul covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/dkvb1d/state_of_the_subreddit_rules_amas_transparency/). In our revamp, we accidentally made Rule 8 less explicit. The rule used to state that the 10% limit took into consideration sites and topics, but in our revamp this was altered to say ""single site or on any profile/channel"". This wording has been corrected to reflect we still take into consideration excessive promotion of a single topic. 

# Previous Meta Monday
Last Meta Monday we discussed [Player Counts &amp; Sales Numbers Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/eo4v7q/weekly_rgames_discussion_meta_monday_how_to/). Admittedly, participation was not as high as we were hoping and the opinions on these particular threads seem to be rather split on both ends of the issues so at this time we do not have any information to share regarding policy updates on these types of threads. However, we will call out how we currently deal with these:

* Sales threads are currently permitted as long as original sources are linked to per Rule 6.1. Exceptions for this are when sales figures are given in a format such a conference call which has not been transcribed, when the figures are not available in English, or when the figures are behind a paywall/subscription such as some of the NPD Group's data. 

* Player count threads are currently permitted if the player count updates are notable and aren't simply updates for the sake of updates (Rule 4). Examples for notable player count submissions would be a newly released game's player count numbers are announced by a developer or a game has hit a new player count record high after a considerable time after release. Player count submissions that we would likely remove for being low-effort or duplicate submissions would be periodic player count updates for games which have stopped receiving support from developers, or multiple player count updates shortly after a game's release.",24,1585574389,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/frqnpa/weekly_rgames_discussion_meta_monday_handling/,Games,1

If it's irony, then ignore this, but just as /pol/ is irony, at some point it doesn't actually matter anymore. The fact of the matter is that games typically ship in a full package. Microtransactions, even lootboxes, are meant to be an addon to the base game. The problems arise when a game is either designed negligently or on purpose so that it's boring or hard to achieve things like leveling up and coerce people to buy their way through the game in small, unnoticeable amounts that pile up. This is the entire problem. While EA has problem with crunch, as does the entire videogames industry, that's not typically the main focus. Point is, this wojack type humour of ""EA bad"" is just stupid.",1,1585548379,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/frlf8g/it_would_seem_like_weve_started_defending_eas/,Games,1

I feel like in the Original Xbox era there were a lot of games being developed for relatively cheaply that were trying a lot of things that you might never see in a game today. The first that comes to mind was a Majesco release that had an announced, then promptly cancelled sequel on the Xbox One called ""Phantom Dust"". It was a hybrid action//card game that had a neat online lobby and 'credit' system that allowed you to spend points earned in online matches on new 'packs' of ability cards to refine your character (this was before the era of (micro transactions so there weren't any pay to play systems in the game).

The second was a larger, higher profile release called Mech-assault: 2; It sort of fell under the radar because the actual game-play was slower and less fluid than it's predecessor, however the feature it had that blew middle school me away, were it's dynamic, social multiplayer lobbies where you could run around as your avatar (this was mind-blowing back in the day), and its multiplayer component known as ""Conquest"" which amounted to a map featuring nodes owned by your clan and others online, and as you decided to 'invade' another clan's node you would be presented with a game featuring conditions (game type, map, ect.) specific to that node and had to win in order to 'conquer' that node. It was mind-blowing to twelve year old me to be able to play a game on consoles, online, that had so many mmo-esque features.

What were some features in games that didn't quite hit the mainstream that impressed you for the time?",407,1585541517,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/frk0gc/what_were_some_games_that_flew_under_the_radar/,Games,1

Recently I read through Vulturebeat's [""post-mortem"" of God of War](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/04/god-of-war-postmortem-the-making-of-god-of-war/) as well as the infamous tale of the struggle to create [Mass Effect: Andromeda](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/12/the-story-behindmass-effect-andromedas-troubled-five-year-development/). I was wondering if anyone knew of any other long-form articles discussing the making of a specific game akin to those two? I know there are plenty of videos on YouTube such as the brilliant documentaries by Noclip, but I always prefer to digest my information in a written form, rather than video which always has a tendency to skim over the more technical and esoteric details.

frb2dh,hotstickywaffle,What are the worst/most useless/annoying thing in a game?,"You ever play a game and think ""why would they ever think to do that""? I don't mean predatory stuff like freemium games, I mean things that someone thought was a good idea that wasn't, or an attempt at immersion that just became a nuisance.

The thing that inspired me to make this post is courtesy of Borderlands. I absolutely love those games, but for some reason whenever your character sprints for more than a few seconds (which you do basically constantly unless you're in the middle of a fight), your character starts breathing heavily. There's no stamina in the game, there is absolutely no reason for the game to do this. They just decided to annoy people with this obnoxious heavy breathing noise as a punishment for doing something you have to do. God forbid you get stuck in the middle of a big map and your vehicle gets blown up.

fraze8,ShinigamiOfPast,"Ever dreamed of prototype 3? well, we are working on it!","  

Basically, we just made a discord server open to everyone that aims at creating a prototype game from scratch, That is, if Activision approves our work, if not then we are going to make a game that closely resembles Prototype title. 

This idea was born 2 days ago, also the day our Discord server was created. We already have many talented people on our side, but we still need more. Prototype (stylized as \[PROTOTYPE\]) is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Activision. Unfortunately the sequel to the franchise didn\`t sell well enough in Activision\`s eyes, so they dropped the tittle.

What they did not realize is that, Prototype had very dedicated fan base that loved and adored the game. Till this day, after 8 years of Negligence from Activision, the fan base stays strong. We realized that the new title wouldn\`t come anytime soon, so we decided to create our own.

if you know how to: game design, draw, code, model, animate or you know any other craft that is needed to make a videogame or just want to give some suggestions, feel free to join, we are making this on unreal engine 4.",9,1585507898,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fraze8/ever_dreamed_of_prototype_3_well_we_are_working/,Games,0

fr8qu1,cchaudio,A GameStop Story,"There's been a lot of news lately about how GameStop is kind of a scummy company, and I thought I would share a story about their business practices that would help put that into perspective. I was a store manager in Rochester, initially at EBGames until the GameStop merger in the mid 2000s.  
  
We had an opening for a new store manager, and our District Manager (DM) was interviewing a few people. One of those interviewees was one of my employees who was a very nice woman who was just out of college, drowning in college debt, and couldn't get a job in her field. The DM stops by my store and takes her out to lunch to talk about the position. They get back a couple hours later, I ask her how it went, and she bursts into tears. I get someone to cover the floor, we go in the stockroom, and I ask her what happened. Apparently he told her, in no uncertain terms, that if she slept with him, she would have her own store. Now this DM was easily twice her age, married with kids, and was the most oily sleazy type of used-car-style-salesman I've ever met. I had no doubt her story was true after having seen this guy at the Vegas managers convention hitting on anything with a pulse.  
  
She was devastated and sobbing and wants to quit right then and there. I tell her it's ok, we'll call human resources right now and this pos will be fired by tomorrow morning. I mean that's how it works right? The HR people immediately move me up the ladder and I'm talking to someone higher up in the department. He tells me he doesn't need to talk to her, send her home, and someone will talk to me in the morning before open. I send her home, tell her everything will be fine by tomorrow.  
  
I get to the store in the morning and in the day's delivery there is an envelope for me with a bunch of papers. I then get a call from someone in HR and they want me to go to a notary, sign the papers, and send them back ASAP. I'm not about to sign anything until I know whats going on. They explain to me that this is an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement), if I sign it, I get to keep my job. I will also need to write up my employee for at least one issue a week for the next two weeks and then she is going to be terminated, don't let her quit. I won't have to fire her directly, someone from HR is going to call and talk to her. It was pretty obvious they were trying to build cause to fire her so that if anything happened in the future it would be a bitter ex-employee's word against this DM's. Now I needed this job, I was also drowning in student debt, but this was just a bridge too far. I told them I wouldn't sign the papers and I was putting in my two weeks. They made vague threats but really what can they do? Make sure I never work in retail again? That would be tragic.  
  
Over the next week I talk with everyone on my staff and bless their hearts, every single one of them quit. We were also deep into the holiday season, so everyone's last day was the day before thanksgiving. This is also when black Friday madness was at it's absolute peak. I filed everyone's paperwork with HR but may have neglected to inform the DM. I had enough acquaintances in the mall to find out the store was never opened on Black Friday and only had a single person running it for a few weeks after, as they scrambled to find staff from other stores. After a few months into the EBGames-GameStop merger, the pos DM (who was suppose to be the new regional manager) was suddenly let go. I know this because I saw him working at a men's shoe store in the same mall a couple months later. The wronged employee never filed charges, but she did land a job that was actually in her field and was doing well the last time I heard from her. I also moved onto bigger and better things and never worked in retail again. I really hope that guy is still toiling away in footwear in that dying mall.  
  
TL;DR Worked at GameStop, employee was propositioned by an upper manager, company backed him. Everyone in the store quit before black Friday in protest, guy got fired, everything worked out great for everyone else involved.",4,1585500015,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fr8qu1/a_gamestop_story/,Games,3

fr1h4e,GhostNev,My Reasoning Why Video Games Aren’t Exciting or Intriguing Like They Used to Be When We Were Kids,"The argument on why games don’t feel as fun as they did when we were kids always comes around to how much the concept of Open World, RPG, FPS, or whatever other genre’s there are has been done so many times, we don’t feel like it’s a refreshing/new experience.  That is a big part of it but my own reasoning is because as a Kid we used our imaginations while we would play games and play out silly scenarios in our head giving the game a great appreciation for the simplest of things. Example, in an Open World game where you can fly a plane around the map isn’t all that fun to us now, but as a Kid we’d imagine flying pedestrians to their destination and even talking like a pilot and it was so much fun but now that we’re grown we don’t really care to have a make believe scenario playing out in our heads. We care about objectives and getting the game completed so we just scim through it; and if not, the game gets boring super quick. I couldn’t tell you how many games I just lollygagged around without even caring about finishing it when I was younger because everything just felt so fun to do and a little bit of imagination made the game come to life. Growing up we’ve grown too much of an expectation how the games we play should be and we completely disregard all the silly things we can do even if it’s just as simple as driving around town. My point is; as a Kid, games were new to us and all the little things we could do, it was very enjoyable. We didn’t care about what the game was about or what we had to do to progress through it. It was just super fun with whatever the game had to offer. I wish I could gain that feel of games back and really enjoy them like I used to, but after 500+ games we’ve got a sense of “I’ve done this before in another game, yawn!” and our imagination doesn’t hold up enough for us to enjoy it since we’re all adults now only caring how good the mechanics, graphics, and story are.

fr0u9k,MigBird,Devs need to learn what shape the human hand is and stop putting critical once-every-second functions on the bumpers.,"I just alerted the Mega Man Zero/ZX Collection on Switch, and to my frustration and disappointment, they’ve locked the controls to only use face buttons and bumpers. Why? So they could put a couple of incidental menu functions you’ll barely use, which only exist for 2 of the 6 games in the collection anyway, on the triggers.

The triggers are big, easy-to-find buttons that your index fingers naturally rest on when holding a controller. They are perfect for functions that need to be used quickly, reliably, and repeatedly. That’s why they serve as the triggers for guns or the pedals for vehicles. The bumpers, on the other hand, are small and out of the way, and force you to strain your fingers up on the controller or hold it in an unusual manner if you want your fingers to rest on them. They should be reserved for things like signals, activating devices/modes, or opening a menu.

When you have to do something like stretch the webbing of your fingers to remain in a ready position, you’re taking yourself out of the game and breaking your focus. It’s even more egregious on the Switch, where resting your fingers on the triggers on handheld mode actually helps support the system in your hands. The playability of these games is severely impacted by this decision, which I’m pretty sure was made just because the Collection is emulating games with no trigger button graphics in its controls menu. But given the collection has a top-level menu outside both games where universal options can be switched, it’s ludicrous that one of those options isn’t ""swap RB and RT”, a function that has already appeared in Capcom’s own Monster Hunter games.

It’s an oversight that sounds minor when described and yet the impact is has on the gameplay experience is absolutely disastrous, and it’s not unique to ports and emulated collections. I see this problem in indie games a lot too, with controls that can’t be remapped at all. And while you might be tempted to think this is a problem with the design of the Switch controllers, there are mods that exist now specifically to fix this issue on the PV version of the MMZX Collection.

It’s a very simple fix; either allow remapping, ideally, or failing that at least put all your most critical and repeated functions where the player can get to them easily. This kind of oversight is completely inexcusable, it should have been fixed following the first playtesting session. Controls that are physically uncomfortable to engage with are a problem that shouldn’t exist by this point in the industry’s life.",39,1585460766,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fr0u9k/devs_need_to_learn_what_shape_the_human_hand_is/,Games,1

fqu56l,Chameleon777,Under Represented Game Genre.,"I want to build. Build characters, societies, buildings, robots, vehicles, worlds... There's just not enough out there for people like me.  I've played The Sims 1-3 to death and someday might get back to it and check out 4, and I've done city builders and such, but hierarchical city building is just paint by numbers. Been there, done that. When I discovered that you could build stuff that actually works in Minecraft, like big machines for killing monsters and collecting their goodies, detecting the maturity of plants and auto-harvesting them, and so on, I was able to overlook the low res blocky nature of the game, and I was impressed at the sheer size of the worlds. But I hate blocks and I don't need a world quite that big.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be cool with a freebuild game with significantly better graphics with a world size a fraction that of Minecraft. Minecraft had a little something for everyone. A survival mode for the adventurer/survivalist/explorer types, and a creative mode for people like me who just like to build stuff. The problem I found though is that the building/inventing aspect was a bit convoluted and building with these big blocks often meant the end product was enormous. I'd absolutely love to find a game that really focuses on the inventing side of things with a nice user friendly system for assembling sophisticated mechanisms that actually look really cool, and not chunky. Is there a game out there that marries the aesthetic design and maybe even character generation aspects of The Sims, with the mechanical inventing aspects of Minecraft in a fairly large open world? If not, somebody seriously needs to invent one. I want to get my design and engineering on and make worlds, buildings, robots or machines that just make the online community go ""Wow!"". I want to put parts together in ways even the game programmers never imagined to come up with really cool stuff. Give me gears and sprockets, logic systems and motors, pulleys, pistons and rods, and sensors galore! Give me next level mechanical physics modelling in real time and a UI that allows me to dedicate all my brain power to creativity with easy to remember hot keys, grid and angle snapping features, and oh yes, pretty please, light on dark decent sized print. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you know of any games out there that to any degree resemble what I am describing, please let me know. And if you don't but would like to see more games for inventors get made, please also let me know.  I know I can't be the only one.  

&amp;#x200B;

Game devs, FPS is fine, but it's not the only game genre for which there is a demand. EA, Ubisoft, anyone, if you build it, they will come!  You've seen what inventor types were able to do with Minecraft, now take it to the next level and give us what we really want. You won't regret it.",9,1585434615,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fqu56l/under_represented_game_genre/,Games,0

fqdbv0,Underwhere_Overthere,A look at 5 ambitious Wii games that were canceled.,"I was thinking about the Wii era and some of the games that never came to be. There were quite a few that had potential, but for one reason or another never saw the light of day. I'm going to share a little bit about each game and show gameplay/deep dives with each game.

1. Super Mario Spikers - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkWjM0V5dW4) - Mario hasn't branched out to a new sport in awhile, but back in the late 2000s, people would joke about how they would invent a new sport for Mario to play after he ran out of all the existing ones. Well, that's what this game was supposed to be - some strange cominbation of volleyball and wrestling. The video I linked really tells the story.

2. Project HAMMER - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgE3X64YWOE) - This was meant to be an waggle action game by Nintendo Software Technology. Admittedly the gameplay shown doesn't look super appealing, but I'm including it because it's a Nintendo game. Apparently Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario, Zelda, and Pikmin, didn't like that the team had spent $1 million on CGI cutscenes. In addition, half the employees of this team left the company, partly due to the leadership being difficult to work with. This team hasn't been given any equivalent big projects to work with since, being relegated to only work on handheld games up until the release of the Switch, with most of their games being Mario vs Donkey Kong titles.

3. The Grinder - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NmnHJc4pvI) - This was sold as a Left 4 Dead for the Wii, and it really does look like it. The creature design is a fair bit more demonic though - more vampires and werewolves than zombies. It was going to be four players online and include boss-like enemies that would stalk the players. The game had an impressive amount of enemies on screen at one time. I really haven't seen anything else quite like it on the Wii.

4. Sadness - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnBp8j4BscI) - This was going to be a Victorian era survival horror game, with the entire game in black and white. The game was penned to rely on psychological horror rather than violence. The game would use waggle controls, like waving a torch (Wii Remote) around to scare off rats, and the ability to use any item in the game as a weapon.

5. Baten Kaitos 3 - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAxsDtbnoAU) - The video linked is of Baten Kaitos Origins, as there is no video footage of Baten Kaitos 3 (I just put it there so people unfamiliar with the series can get an idea of the game). - Baten Kaitos is a JRPG with two games on the GameCube. The developer Monolith Soft, creator of Xenoblade Chronicles, were sold from Bandai Namco to Nintendo, who offered them more creative control, and the game was canceled as a result. They were up to the pre-production phase before its cancellation. Baten Kaitos also had a DS game canceled, meaning the series has had just as many canceled games as released games. From my understanding, Bandai Namco has control of the IP so Monolith Soft can't make a sequel without getting them involved.

It's a shame some of these games never came to be, but maybe some projects these developers worked on wouldn't have existed if these other games weren't canceled first. Still, it's fun to reminisce and imagine what could have been.",7,1585369811,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fqdbv0/a_look_at_5_ambitious_wii_games_that_were_canceled/,Games,1

fqcegh,antifanboydevon,A large complaint I have about Animal Crossing New Horizons that I'm shocked I'm not hearing more of,"My situation may be more unique than others but I bought the game and started it after the podcast on Sunday, after that I never really got out of the tutorial section and by the time I got back to it (beat DOOM Eternal first) there was an update waiting for me, after that I realized I had to redo the tutorial and pick my island, tent placement no big deal. 

What I wasn’t quite prepared for was the insane gatekeeping the game has at least concerning Day 1. I’ve had people up my ass all week about visiting their islands, giving/trading fruit yadda yadda. So naturally I’m excited to use the airport. I get there, am told the airport is closed until tomorrow… OK a little annoying but I get it, there’s things to be done. I go to Tom, something about paying off my miles. OK SURE. Go fishing (not my favorite but w/e), shake trees, collect bugs more DIY projects and slowly gain enough miles. 

Here’s where my frustration begins, I must give tom “critters” up to 5. OK. I can’t just give him all 5 at once. I have to manually talk to him, select the item, more talking OK. Then I have to repeat this 5 times in a row. I was told I can eat fruit to get strong. OK NEAT! I go into my menu, eat 1 fruit… go back in again eat 1 fruit, rinse and repeat but c’mon, let me just take all 10 at once like a normal game in 2020. At this point I’m out of fruit, I’m out of rocks, I’m maybe out of twigs (idk if they regen) but I’m just going in circles on my island which 75% is gated off by water due to the design I picked, which I GUESS is my fault but still frustrating. Nook tells me about this museum guy, tells me to pick a spot “finally getting somewhere!” build it and am told it will be fixed up by tomorrow. OK but how do I get to \*tomorrow\*? Pay off the 5000 miles and Tom mentions the house. I even pick the roof color! “Alright we’ll build your house tomorrow!”  OK MAYBE TOMORROW WILL COME NOW!?

It doesn’t, I’m confused and at this point very annoyed. I look online, don’t see anything talking about moving to the next day. Maybe it’s this nook mile+ ticket thing to open the airport. I buy it and still nothing.  I ask my friends; I’m told I have to wait. “What do you mean wait?”, “oh the day will reset tomorrow at 6AM” So there’s no way I can move forward? “it’s not that kind of game.” I’ve replayed the tutorial twice and after a frustrating week of quarantining and working from home I just want to play the game I bought but I can’t because “it’s not that kind of game”.  I’m artificially held back by the game at this point. I’m sure this is only a problem for now and after day 2 things will open up but because I was efficient with my goals and did everything and then some I have no choice but to sit on my ass until 6AM tomorrow to continue playing the game I spent $60 on, cant’s visit friend’s islands or random islands for materials.  Ironically, I am enjoying the game, I like shaking trees, breaking rocks catching bugs, fishing isn’t my favorite but it’s not HORRIBLE. I just want to do more with it but “it’s not that kind of game”.",17,1585365952,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fqcegh/a_large_complaint_i_have_about_animal_crossing/,Games,1

fqavs0,ContributorX_PJ64,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 in development. CI Games pleased with sales of Contracts. (Google translated interview.),"&gt;Work on Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is in full swing. It is too early to give the release date of the game, but I do not rule out that it will take place this year. The team creating the series consists of experienced people, so work on the next part is much more predictable, it is easier to plan and react on a regular basis if something is not going according to plan. **We are preparing a large new feature of the game that should encourage the purchase of a new part of both fans of the series and new players.** We will also introduce many other improvements over the previous part. It will be a completely new story in another, new region of the world. The game will go to consoles and PC, and its production budget will be lower than the previous one. **With regular release of games in the series, we will also be able to partially reduce marketing expenses.**   
&gt;  
&gt;I am pleased with the sale of Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts. I think the release date was correct. Thanks to her, the title was available on store shelves around the world for the holiday season. His resale in physical distribution channels is so satisfactory that today in many large markets, such as the USA or Germany, the game is still sold at the premiere price. This is very important in the aspect of the next game in the series, our partners will gladly deal with its distribution on individual international markets. I am also happy with the sale of the game on digital platforms, especially in the Steam store. Looking at the digital distribution platform, the game received very good ratings from players. All this allows you to calmly plan the future of the series.

IMO, the ""large new feature"" they're talking about is likely co-op. It's a constantly requested feature on social media, Steam, etc. The PvP MP in the SGW series has its fans, but there's a persistent demand to be able to play with friends. And if they add co-op, I think they'll probably add character customization with male/female protag options, which would be good.

I have some qualms about the release schedule. They're not ruling out a 2020 release. There's a general mood in the fanbase that the PvP MP for Contracts was a ""bullet point"" and they should have funneled their resources into new maps, new contracts, and maybe co-op. So while Contracts had a very positive reception considering the series' legacy, people were expecting Hitman-style post-release content additions. But it's clear that Contracts is now in bug fixing/post release polish mode and most of the team is working on the sequel.

What they should do, IMO, is release Contracts 2 with this shiny new campaign and design improvements, but include the missions from Contracts as a bonus campaign. Maybe sell it as DLC with a discount for owners of the first game or give it to them free. That's the Hitman approach and it works well.

But they should be wary about how they approach releases. SGW3 being a train wreck at launch really hurt Contracts. But Contracts being pretty darn good will help Contracts 2. However, if they start churning out Contracts 2, 3, 4, SGW: Electric Boogaloo on an annual schedule they will evaporate goodwill. It doesn't matter if the games are solid. People don't like being milked. They don't like the perception of games being released, and then abandoned to push a full priced (read: 40 dollars AA pricing) sequel with content that should probably have been a 20 dollar expansion pack.",36,1585360042,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fqavs0/sniper_ghost_warrior_contracts_2_in_development/,Games,1

fq78xw,Underwhere_Overthere,10 single player Wii exclusives you forgot existed.,"A lot of people remember the Wii by its mini game collection games like Rayman Raving Rabbids, Carnival Games, and Wii Party. While that’s certainly true, the Wii got a number of middling single player games, and other types of games I won’t talk about here. Here’s five I think you may find interesting. All of them got between a 70%-79% on Metacritic. So they are decent, but almost all of them lacked enough content to justify the $50 price tag.

1. Deadly Creatures - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/jPpbFHO) - Play as a tarantula or scorpion and perform old-school God of War type finishing moves. This game really is one of kind in its premise. It plays most similarly to action adventure games like God of War, Devil May Cry, and Ninja Gaiden.

2. Cursed Mountain - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/YdbfP57) - A mountaineer searches for his lost brother in the Himalayas in this survival horror game. Content with spirits of lost climbers and angry monks via Wii waggle controls.

3. Disaster: Day of Crisis - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/rTYxcRL) - A rail shooter centering around a former U.S. Marine. This game has you performing all sorts of quick time events in the middle of cinematic action sequences.

4. The KORE Gang - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/HgtjVRO) An action adventure game 10 years in the making about a robot suit saving Manhattan from a civilization emerging from underground. It’s fairly cartoony and zany.

5. The Conduit 1 &amp; 2 - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/53vh29o) The first game had a lot of hype surrounding it as one of the few first person shooter Wii games, in a time when first person shooters were insanely popular. These are futuristic shooters with high quality graphics for the Wii. Both focus around the single player campaign, but the first does have online multiplayer, and the sequel has online and offline multiplayer as well.

6. Rabbids Go Home - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/hzTuqeB) I know this is a Ubisoft game and that Rabbids are popular, but I feel like the various mini game collections overshadowed this entry. This is an action adventure game with a beginning and an end, focused on the Rabbids collecting all types of items to build pile on top of each other in order to reach the moon.

7. Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/moFhOo5) An aerial combat game with optional motion controls - you can use a controller if you want. A second player can jump into the action and fire at enemy plans, but they aren't controlling a plane like the first player.

8. Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/6Z2kCrW) An on rails shooter and a sequel to the 2000 Japanese exclusive Nintendo 64 game. Just like Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces, a second player can join in and control a reticle, but they don't get to control a character like the first player.

9. Pandora's Tower - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/VYbKyR4) This is an action role-playing game, and one of three JRPGs under Operation Rainfall - a fan campaign that seeked to bring Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story, and Pandora's Tower North America (all three were eventually brought over). The protagonist Aeron explores the Thirteen Towers to save his lover Elena from a curse.

10. Battalion Wars 2 - [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/jPbVsIM) This one was actually published by Nintendo, but I still feel like I haven't heard about outside Advance Wars message boards in years. This is a real time tactics game, and was actually going to carry the Advance Wars name at one point. You play as a ground troop in a third person perspective and issue orders to other ground infantry, tanks, and planes.

Hope you enjoyed this blast from the past. I was just reminiscing about the Wii and hadn’t heard about any of these games in years, so I figured I’d try to generate some discussion around them if anyone here has played any of these or wants to discuss other forgotten Wii games. There's a lot more that could be named - I could probably do a list with 50 of these. The Wii really did have a lot of good games that just needed to be priced a little lower.",51,1585347702,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fq78xw/10_single_player_wii_exclusives_you_forgot_existed/,Games,1

However I wasn't prepared for the lore dump and how amazing it was. It really built up the character of the Doom Slayer and elevated him personally to one of my favorite characters in recent memory. It gave him a personality, a face, a goal, a sense of who he is and why he is instead of just some faceless/voiceless man who goes around killing hellspawn. (There is a lot of reading, but it's well worth it)

Fuck, I'm old.  


So I wanted to ask you guys for recommendations of similar games. Specially if they interact with your email client and you need to research shit outside the UI (I remember In Memoriam needed you to use Google search, Google maps and even research some metadata in some files in your PC).

fpzsj3,Hexdoctor,Stealth Bias in games and Alternatives to Stealth Bonus,"A common recurrence in games (based on personal experience only) is the bias in games in favor of stealthy play-styles. I figured I would make this thread to open a discussion about, and explore some alternatives to the ways in which games tend to reward stealthier playstyles.  
(Disclaimer:I like playing stealthy most of the time but not all the time)

Some games gives you the option to choose different battle tactics. Like being fast and deadly with a shotgun, dominating the battle with high magic, being armored to the teeth with a shield and sword in hand or to be loud and lethal with machine-guns and rocket launchers. Even stealth-based games like Dishonor let's you choose between more or less stealthy approaches. I can think of so many games off of the top of my head where the rogue, assassin or sniper options are better in so many different ways.  
Now it should be said, in fairness, that a class tactic where the core mechanic is to kill your target before they have a chance to react is hard to balance correctly. However my grievance is not with this issue, but rather with the tendency to put additional rewards on top of it all. Like getting more loot, more experience, more dialogue options or better story endings simply because you chose this play-style. In some instances it can be argued that the stealth option is more difficult but in most cases this is wholly not the case or only true until you get enough upgrades.   


As with any good rant, obviously something ticked me off that gave me the urge to make this post. I'm going to use that something as an example of what I'm trying to convey. You can skip this paragraph if you feel like you already understand my point.   
I'm currently playing Far Cry: New Dawn. An open world FPS game where you can liberate outposts occupied by enemies. I started using big guns and lots of explosives. I really liked causing mayhem and walking in like I owned the place. At some point I found out that if you liberate the outposts without the enemy setting off the alarm and without being detected you get a whopping 50% more loot. So I changed out my gear and specced into being sneaky.   
Not only do I get a way bigger reward from liberating outposts but it's unbelievably easier. I play on the highest difficulty but it no longer feels like it.   
I have unreasonably good silencers on all my guns. I can take out an enemy with with my assault rifle and as long as her friend keeps in line with social distancing it will go unnoticed. I can sprint while crouching, do silent melee takedowns on any enemy with combo takedowns on anyone in close proximity. My sniper rifle can kills most enemies with a body shot, from a distance where only other snipers can even attempt to find me. Lastly, my sidekick is so stealthy that he can't be seen if he completely blocks their field of view and will instantly kill any enemy behind me before they notice me.   
So in conclusion. Not only do I get more rewards, not only is the game way easier but I use 99% less resources (read: ammo, medkits, explosives).   
There's hardly any doubt that stealth is king in this game, even when its predecessor Far Cry 5 was more balanced.   


Now that I've said my peace I wanna know:  
1. Are there any good ways to reward and create incentive for other classes? Any solutions you've seen in games that you really liked or any ideas you have?  
Off the top of my head I can think of things like loot protected by large groups of weaker enemies that can be easily dealt with by a powerful wizard or an expertly handled rocket launcher  but would quickly overwhelm and assassin that can only focus down one at the time.  
Or how about some chests/doors that can't be lockpicked without setting off a trap/alarm, but can be dismantled by an expert demolitionist.   
Maybe going in loud and lethal sets off the alarm, summoning bigger, meaner enemies that have a chance of dropping unique items.  
2. To what extent do you agree with my observations? Am I wrong for believing games that give you multiple options tend to favor the rogue archetypes. Or perhaps I'm right in this regard but the bias is somehow justified?  
3. If you agree with me that this is a common occurrence, why do you think that is? Why do they so often favor stealth? My theory is that they believe stealth requires more tactic and ingenuity but mostly I find that stealth is often the easiest solution.   


TL;DR: I think games that lets you choose play-style unjustly rewards stealthy play-styles (rogues, assassins, snipers, etc.) and want your ideas on how to reward other play-styles.",54,1585325748,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpzsj3/stealth_bias_in_games_and_alternatives_to_stealth/,Games,4

A digressognition about two of portable gaming’s best from a bygone age of hardware limitations

by Sgoti


INTRODUCTION


There were more than these two handheld consoles that used monochrome display. There was also the OG Wonderswan, and multiple half-arsed cash-in attempts we are not even going to mention. 
The japan-only wonderswan we won’t be talking about, because I don’t know much about it. I know that the meat of its library is (Japanese) text heavy RPGs and that its audience was mainly younger players with an affinity for shonen manga and anime that was popular at the time. It’s definitely one of the harder handhelds to enjoy for non-Japanese readers.
I will now talk, rave, write, or ramble about these two pocket gaming devices so dear to my heart. 

THE GAMEBOY



It was the first widely successful attempt at a handheld console, and defined what can be expected of nomad gaming. It provided the immersion that home consoles were offering at the time, only on the smaller scale of the famous 160x144, four shades of grey, dot matrix screen. Despite this huge limitation, it managed to be successful. Because it was affordable, because it didn’t eat batteries, yes, but also because, somehow it provided entertainment. This is its most impressive feat I believe: how come this tiniest screen could be looked at and enjoyed? It wasn’t just a novelty effect too, for nowadays in our age of high definition (higher and higher...) I am still playing it from time to time, and still enjoy it. It has the ability to entertain, I believe, in the same ways minimalistic music can be appreciated. Less stimuli leave more room for imagination, but weak hardware surpassing itself is a thing of wonder too.

Take one of GB’s crowning achievements: the recently remade TLoZ: Link’s Awakening. The game is tiny, but we have more freedom in it than we would believe could fit in a 160x144 pixels window. The explorable world is great in comparison to the hardware’s specs, so is our overhead Link’s range of actions. The story told by it also speak of wider ideas, as the protagonist is questioned on the very nature of his purpose: Should he, or should he not, brandish his sword and put an end to the dream he and many others live in? By no means an easy question to answer, even though the game is only meant to be played one way: get to the end of the dream. 

In my eye, the more impressive GB games are those that try to create the illusion of life: tiny dioramas with moving objects, characters, and set of defined laws give the illusion of a little hermetically closed world brought to life by a few blips and pixels. This is best done in 2D platformers, and the illusion made all the more believable as it is more polished. In this regard, some of the GB’s famously harder to find games, like Trip World and Megaman IV and V, are prime examples. The sprite work, animation, and background details put the hardware to its limit in order to cram as much movement and diversity in the screen as is technically possible. 

Famously, Trip World is less of a traditional platformer than it is an experiment in digital diorama. It presents almost no challenge whatsoever, but instead presents us with rich and detailed “worlds” (merely levels but they are called “worlds”) inhabited by creatures as rarely belligerent as they are varied in shape and animation. Trip World’s few secrets have no more purpose than that of being discovered, triggering but a silly effect (Yacopu, the games protagonist can be made tiny under certain conditions, but this is of no use) or rewarding the player with the sight of a hidden character doing his thing. Yet, these pointless details seem to be the whole point of Trip World.

As for Megaman IV and V, their gameplay is very similar to the NES games, only more cramped, though design layout takes that in consideration. These games did not settle with being compromised versions of the NES games, as were the first three GB outings: Both had exclusive levels (MM V being a whole new game) and multiple small additions, such as charged shot recoil, a fancy rotating stage select screen and animated cutscenes in MM IV, a shoot-em up style stage in MM V, and item shop in both games.

A nice specificity of the GB’s huge library of games, is that of discovering its gems, games that flew under the radar or that were exclusive to the Japanese market. Games like Vanishing Racer, a Mario Land clone that has you controlling a Car in platforming action, Burning Paper, that has you getting rid of insects crawling up a wall by laser-cutting pieces of placarded ads to fall unto them (best description I could come up with) or the scarcely produced, crowning jewel of the shoot them up genre on the GB, Chikyuu Kaihou Gun ZAS.

ZAS is the best example of a special effect that was rarely used throughout the GB’s life, which consists of using the screen’s tendency to blur as a way to produce a transparency effect (by an alternate display, one frame out of two, some graphics can appear transparent). It is used for example in Link’s Awakening on the Dog’s chain leash (the chomp). In ZAS though, the effect is used to the extent of producing multiple layers of scrolling background. The five vertical scrolling levels in that game have a degree of detail and polish unattained by any other shooter on the console, and the fact that is was released in 1992, when the lifespan of the monochrome GB ended in 1998, tell us how seldom the hardware’s advanced graphical tricks were used.

THE NEO GEO POCKET



Now for the Neo Geo Pocket. This is a whole other beast. Released in 1998 to snatch market shares off of Nintendo’s GB, it was doomed from the start by unfortunate timing. That year the Game Boy Color was released, and all of a sudden monochromatic screens were made obsolete. It tells a lot about Nintendo’s handheld market domination at the time. Yet, the NGP offered what nintendon’t: Fighting games optimised for portable gaming. These kind of games are famously best played in arcades with a microswitch joystick, and SNK awesomely featured a miniaturized version of the joystick, clicks included, in its handheld device. The NGP is a joy to hold, its design so well thought and comfortable, it was made to play SNK’s arcade catalogue in a compressed fashion: color and high-res sprites were kept out, while gameplay and the physical bond that linked the player to the arcade, the joystick, were kept in. Its intellectual property received a super deformed makeover to fit the tiny resolution, all the while keeping its identity and appeal: King of Fighters characters, Metal Slug and Neo Turf masters all remained recognizable. 
Mentioning precisely these IPs is no coincidence: they are almost all you can play on the NGP, as its library, unfortunately, offers infinitely less than the GB’s.

Playing it today, the NGP is full of wonders: Besides it’s unique control stick, the monochrome screen is better than what popular belief makes of it. Often one will read that the Neo Geo Pocket Color upgrade is the better console, but having tried both, I prefer to stick to the monochrome. Here are my reasons: The NGP(C) was primarily made for fighting games adaptations, and unless you really enjoy having many of this kind of game to play (in particular the “color only” games such as the SNK vs. Capcom crossover title, or the all-girls-cast Gals Fighters, or even The Last Blade 2) the few fighting representatives available on the black-and-white model, King of Fighters R-1 &amp; R-2 are as good as they get on such limited hardware and only benefit so slightly from color upgrade. Gameplay is very responsive, and special moves come out like a charm. A feature common to all fighting games on the NGP(C), is that both action buttons are pressure sensitive: Light press for weak attacks, hard press for strong attacks. It allows for faithful recreation of SNK’s traditional four-buttons layout.

One quirk of the monochrome screen I really like is a peculiar effect that can be seen when sunlight comes from an angle: you can see the shadow cast from sprites to the back of the screen, which creates a bit of a slight 3D effect not replicated in the color version. That screen is way better than that of the GB too, having a slightly higher resolution and eight possible shades of gray. 

As for the games outside of the fighting genre, it’s very limited. There is a color Metal Slug adaptation compatible with the monochrome console, and an adaptation of Neo Turf Masters, a pretty good golf game. Really, the NGP is a fighting game console. These games are the meat of its library, and the console’s design was thought out for fighting games ergonomics. It failed against the GB because fighting games are niche, third party support was non-existent, and because Nintendo simply dictated the rules of handheld at the time. 

(SIDE NOTE: I noticed there are screens of varying quality built in NGPs: a white model I have has a very crisp screen with a clear black and white hues, while a clear model I also own has a screen with more brownish hues and a slight blur to it. The later is definitely a bit harder to read. I bought both in like-new condition, so I think they may have used different parts during production of that console.)

WHAT’S THE POINT OF ALL THIS? (conclusion)



Why am I so obsessed with these two consoles? I wrote this to try and find out why. I believe it comes down the notion of essence. These two consoles represent, at least to me, remarkable successes at shrinking, concentrating what makes (at least for the single player experience, multiplayer is, I believe, a whole other subject) the video game experience enjoyable. 

Color and high resolution are powerful parameters for producing immersion and/or enjoyment, but I don’t think they are fundamental in what makes us WANT to, and ENJOY and WONDER looking through the window named screen.

I like that the power of immersion provided by these two consoles is so weak, that it relies so much on the player’s own will to be pulled in, instead of getting its attention with powerfully rendered, believable virtual worlds.

What is it then, that makes me, at least, enjoy these antiquated games? I like to believe that the makers of games’ dedication and passion for their craft is the placeholder for what depth of immersion and/or enjoyment a player will find himself to attain.
This way of seeing things fits my experience with these two consoles and their better games, those that were real passion projects for their makers.

The Game Boy somehow ended up with a huge catalogue of games that gave birth to surprisingly entertaining games, while the Neo Geo Pocket succeeded, (in my opinion) at bringing the very “arcade” feeling of versus fighting to the handheld in such a smart way, by keeping the joystick, the input mechanism that made fighting games so enjoyable in the first place.

There you have it, it’s been entertaining to write this. I hope the reading was to you as well, even slightly so?",1,1585323539,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpz26v/the_game_boy_and_the_neo_geo_pocket_the/,Games,1

&gt;It's a pleasure to dive back into Control, and that's why I genuinely enjoyed my time with The Foundation. I still love hunting down every research note and every minute-long audio file -- anything to fill in more of the lore gaps in this bizarre, enigmatic world. This expansion does all of that even if it's ultimately left feeling inconsequential. Ironically, The Foundation fails to build on the excellent structure Remedy already built with Control.

&gt;The Foundation is an honest DLC, which extends the main adventure by opening a narrative parenthesis that is not exactly explosive, but still solid and convincing.

&gt;By adding a couple more powers that slightly improve frenetic combat and having collectibles and a story that continually outweird themselves in inventive ways, Remedy has shown that Jesse is fit for the job of director and hopefully just getting started.

&gt;Control's first major DLC expansion is a wonderful return to this weird world, even if it doesn't take any huge risks.

&gt;The Foundation is a (too much) linear and fun end game mission for Control. The setting is very weird and fascinating and it's really amazing to unleash the full Jessy potential. On the other hand, the new power, Shape, is less creative and game changing than it should have been, and the result is that the exploration and gameplay feels a little bit railroaded.

&gt;The Foundation delves into the roots of the Oldest House, disclosing hidden truths about the Hiss and The Bureau.

&gt;Polished DLC at Remedy-like quality standard – and that's a huge compliment. The ability to modify the environment doesn't leave the mark, but the narrative, the new floor and the gunplay more than compensate for that minor drawback. Waiting for the Alan Wake DLC, The Foundation is an excellent reason to visit the Oldest House again.

&gt;If the world of Control is your thing, the Foundation delivers. If you want more fights and cool situations with rogue Altered Items, it sounds like you're better off waiting for the next DLC.

fpyefz,NeutralPhysii,An Analysis of the Massively Multiplayer Online [MMO] Genre (Or: How to Make the “Perfect” MMO) 2,"TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM
I’m taking a second crack at this since my last one contained a few sections I wasn’t happy with. 

# Introduction

Every year or so I get this... itch -- this desire to find an MMO game that makes me want to get lost in it. I've tried it all: Elder Scrolls Online, Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft, Black Desert Online, Path of Exile, Diablo III, Path of Exile, Destiny, Destiny 2, DayZ Mod (and DayZ SA, but we don't talk about that), Old School Runescape, Star Citizen, Pirates of the Caribbean Online, and even TOONTOWN ONLINE (side note: this game was amazing as a kid). 

Some notable exceptions are EverQuest, EVE Online, Final Fantasy XIV, and Lord of the Rings Online. I won’t comment on these games, though. They could very well contain much of what this post advocates for, but as I haven’t tried them yet I don’t feel right taking a stance on them. Some people in the last post were advocative of these games, so I shouldn’t make judgments about them without having played them first. 

At the end of the day, though, all of these games  I’ve played have been... missing something. For me, anyway. These missing components vary wildly. Sometimes it's endgame content, sometimes it's early-game content. Sometimes it's PvP content, sometimes it's PvE content. Sometimes it's too mechanically easy, sometimes it's too hand-holding. I could go on all day, and most of you that have played MMOs will probably understand a similar feeling. 

Today I want to take a look at the MMO genre and what can be done to improve it. To do this, I'm going to (briefly) look at and pull some key ideas of what works from various MMO (and non-MMO games), express some of my thoughts, and then give a stipulative definition for the ""perfect"" MMO game (which, it turns out, may require destroying what defines a traditional MMO game). If you want to jump to this part, jump to the bottom. I'm going to try and be realistic about this ""perfect"" game. I realize game developers can't make this massive, trillion-dollar game that will be the end-all-be-all MMO game.

# What Works, What Doesn't, and What's Missing

**What Works:**

* Deep, non-combat skill system

Games like Runescape, Black Desert Online, and Guild Wars 2 have a great concept of providing skills outside of combat-oriented ones to invest time in. Sometimes these fall a little flat/miss the mark, but I think the idea itself is worth keeping.

* Deep, combat-oriented skill system

Most MMO games already have this down. In particular, I'll  Path of Exile as a prime example of introducing a deep skill tree, where each class can become a wide range of things. The class you chose is a guideline but does not define who you are. The fewer restrictions put on what you can be, the better.

* Deep crafting system
* Rewarding combat

I think the above two points need no major elaboration. These are fairly self-explanatory and present in most MMO games, already. 

* Consequences

Games like Runescape and DayZ do a great job of this. I'd also like to pull in what games like Dark Souls, Terraria, and Minecraft do. There are real consequences to dying in-game, ranging from losing some money to losing all of your gear. Finding the right balance to consequences and forgiving failure is important to keep people invested without them quitting.

* Non-combat activities

For this point, I'd like to call in Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto V Online as examples. These games do a great job of providing a variety of activities to do outside of combat that provide different kinds of fun, keeping the game fresh and providing some meaningful downtime. As a bonus, games like Skyrim give combat-related perks to spending time doing non-combat activities (e.g. alchemy). 

I'd also like to cite Stardew Valley as an example. This is a weird one, but let me explain. Stardew Valley has a satisfying dungeon crawler component with simple yet fun combat, yes, but the main focus of the game is farming (and fishing to a lesser extent). It is a proof-of-concept that a large group of people can find enjoyment in a game centered around seemingly ""mundane"" tasks, so long as those tasks are made interesting, engaging, and rewarding on their own. 

Flipping this idea, incorporating non-combat ideas from games like Stardew Valley to traditionally combat-oriented games can provide players of varying interests something to do. Imagine if an MMO game existed where players could find as much fulfillment from harvesting rare crops as from finding rare gear in a dungeon? And imagine if these features played off one another; for example, imagine a certain ingredient for a food item required killing an endgame boss. Rather than force every player to become good enough to do this, however, what if players interested in engame, combat-oriented content sold them to less combat-oriented players on a market? I'm thinking of something like the Trading Post from Guild Wars 2 or the Flea Market in Escape From Tarkov.

* Community

Long ago, games like World of Warcraft had a sense of ""we're in this together"". People used to queue with total strangers to complete quests, dungeons, etc. because... well, how else would you beat them? Nowadays, the reality is that it is very easy to communicate and play with your friends. People prefer to play with their friends and chat on Discord than play with total strangers through text chat. This has made the community less ""connected"" in the sense that people are less likely to look outside their friend groups for people to play with. There is also a significant subset of people that prefer to play alone.

**What Doesn't Work:**

* Catering to the casual audience

We need to be careful, here. Certainly, casual players should be welcome to play the game and should have a place. Realistically, games need to make money. The casual audience provides a lot of money; that does not, however, mean the game should be made artificially easier or simpler to compensate. It has become abundantly clear that there exists a ""hardcore vs casual"" split in the MMO player base. For a game like this to succeed, then, it needs some mediation of these two groups. I will discuss a potential solution later in the post.

* Microtransactions

Need I say more? Microtransactions have a purpose in F2P games, but they should never exceed cosmetic functionality. Providing benefits that bypass grinding is a terrible model that only serves to alienate and frustrate people.

* Unnecessary Grind

Same as above, really. A lot of games put in unnecessary grinds in order to extend the game's lifespan or (worse yet) incentive purchasing microtransactions. 

What constitutes unnecessary? Someone raised this very good question in my last post. After all, a bad grind for one person could be a satisfying grind for another. This is a hard balance to hit, but I think we can make some general decisions. Games like Black Desert Online have a bit too grind-y elements. Games like, say, Skyrim don’t have enough to justify an MMO. 

A grind should be long enough to make it satisfying/rewarding when you accomplish it, but not so long that it makes the experience not fun for the majority of players. I realize this is not a specific answer, but a lot of this has to come from play-testing and obtaining data-driven consensus about grind length. 

**What is Missing:**

I think the thing that is missing the most (and from most of these games) is meaning. Purpose. Sure, I can invest countless hours grinding for the best gear in the game, but why? What meaning does it serve? This is one of the fundamental problems I have had with MMO games in the past. Many MMOs nowadays focus on providing more content, more gear, more grind, etc. because they think more is more. I, however, think that we can do better than that. 

# The ""Perfect"" Game (the TL;DR)

Let me expand on this ""purpose"" idea more, as I'm sure many of you are not sold on this idea. To do so, I will give my current idea for the perfect MMO game. This is not going to be one cohesive game concept so much as a collection of ideas.This game has:

* Combat Roles

To combat meta-gaming taking over the game, making sure that every character has more focus on fulfilling support roles ensures that the game is more about party synergy than any one build. Games like Overwatch show us that support-based characters can function. Other Games like (yes... I'm going to say it) Toontown Rewritten also show how to make every skill valuable, making meta-gaming... kind of a moot point.

* Total content for combat and non-combat players

Total content, in this instance, means that there is sufficient content for either of these groups to get a ""full game's"" worth of experience pursuing either avenue. Players interested in farming, fishing, crafting, cooking, caravaning, etc. should have as many opportunities, incentives, and value as players interested in combat, dungeons, raids, PvP, etc.

* Focused, smaller servers

Since supporting servers for hundreds of people is too expensive to maintain, the game would instead feature something similar but smaller in scale to World of Warcraft, where areas are zoned for a specific amount of players. Similar to Guild Wars 2, each quest area could also have a matchmaking list, where people trying to complete the same quest can party up to complete it. Going one step further, perhaps it is better to make the game not hold everyone's hand. Instead of introducing a bunch of communication features/incentives that not many utilize, perhaps following a model similar to GTAV Online would work better. Players can decide whether to play in a private/public server and matchmake into quests/dungeons, as desired.

* Property

Let's make things more interesting. Let's put property into the game. In this case, many players can buy and own the same house, with each player's house serving as it's own localized area. Guild houses can function in a similar fashion. This can be extended to farmland, as well. Many players could own the same plots of land or mines. They would then choose which to buy based on the region's climate, soil, resources, etc. 

* Realm vs Realm

This idea of property can be further extended by having factions/guilds own regions of land that can be taken over. These factions would receive income/resources based on the number of people that own land, mines, shops, etc. Goods sold in the market also contribute to their land through taxes excised on each sale. These features would only affect those participating in the RvR, and would not affect the aforementioned groups directly, but it would add a whole new layer to the game. Factions could engage in politics and war that reset every season. Factions would receive RvR exclusive rewards at the end of the season based on their performance.

* Make combat *hard*

By creating separate, yet different and rewarding content for the casual players, this provides an opportunity: provide extremely challenging, yet rewarding combat. The combat can be made extremely challenging, yet incredibly lucrative for those willing to invest the time into it. 

We also need to be careful here, too. The game shouldn’t be impossible to play except for masters. It needs to be “easy to learn, difficult to master”. I think games like League of Legends or Counter Strike: Global Offensive strike a good balance for this. Following in their footsteps for balancing difficultly seems like a fair way to open the door to everyone, but making it sufficiently challenging for the very hardcore. 

* **Incentivizing**

This is an important one for me. Rewarding each player base for working towards their own personal, in-game goals gives the game purpose. Want to be a merchant? Here's why you *should* do that. Want to be a healer? Here's why you *should* do that. Want to be a master smither? Here's why you *should* do that. Want to buy a house? Start a farm? Here's why you *should* do that. Going one or two steps beyond the first-level purpose (e.g. ""I am grinding for this better weapon so I can fight harder stuff to get better weapons to fight harder stuff, repeat"") adds complexity to the game without adding more features. Making all of these features co-exist, depend on one another, and impossible for one person to do *everything* means that everyone has the potential to be important. Everyone contributes to the world, whether they fight, farm, craft, smith, politick, caravan, and so on.   

* Incentivizing Story

Last post, it was clear I missed the mark here. MMOs (particularly if it’s going to be an MMORPG) need some form of story. On the flip side of this, not many people listen to the dialogue, read the texts, pay attention to the story, etc. This is particularly the case after people start new characters in the game. In other words, player engagement with the story is generally pretty low, but especially with the more casual audience. What’s the solution, then?

Here’s what I’ve got: make story endgame content. Keep a loose idea of what the world even is for low-level content, but don’t force everyone to go through the story. Make it content intended for people most interested in it: the people dedicated to the game (i.e. the hardcore player base). Make it something mysterious that requires groups of dedicated players to crack open. And here’s where we can tie everything else in: make lore unique to each player group. For example, the non-combat hardcore players have lore, worldbuilding, and story moments that combat-oriented players don’t have (and vice-versa). We can even go a step further by making some quest items require goods from the other player base’s content. This incentives community in more organic ways. Even if we don’t do the last point, it encourages sharing this lore with other players to get the full picture of what the world is all about.  

* Party vs Party

Removing solo PvP altogether and replacing it with Party vs Party combat also disincentives making solo meta builds that pigeonhole endgame. 

* Consequences

The best consequences can be introduced with the best loot. Want extremely rare item drops? You have to put some gear on the line. Perhaps a model similar to Escape From Tarkov would work where, when you decide to do a dungeon or PvP (now Party vs Party, remember?), you have to put a certain amount of currency on the line. Alternatively, you could put all of the gear you are bringing into the dungeon on the line. For PvP, parties could decide whether to put their gear or a certain amount of money on the line against other parties. This could spawn a competitive league on its own, bringing a whole different player base altogether.

# Final Thoughts

This is by no means a complete list. To be honest, many of these ideas *could* turn out to be bad ones or incompatible with one another. I'd love to hear suggestions for what to add, remove, as well as any suggestions, comments, thoughts, etc. on what I've put forward.",7,1585321330,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpyefz/an_analysis_of_the_massively_multiplayer_online/,Games,1

fpx64m,PixtheHeretic,The weird trope of not playing as the real main character,"I tried the Bravely Default 2 demo last night.  It jumped out at me that Gloria seems to be the character with the strongest (if not the only) connection to the main plot.  It looks like you could pluck Seth, the player character, right out and the plot wouldn't be affected in the slightest.  In that case, why don't we just play as Gloria to begin with?

I find this really annoying, and it's something I've been aware of since I heard someone level similar criticism at Final Fantasy 12 (haven't played it).  It just doesn't make sense to me, especially with modern games.  The ""the player needs a normal person/outside as the main character so they can ask the questions to make the plot make sense"" thing is both played out and unnecessary with good writing.

The way I see it, it'd be like if you played Mass Effect 2 as Jacob Taylor or watched Star Wars from C-3PO's perspective.  You'd get to see all the important shit happen and be involved, but you're definitely not getting the full experience.

I'm curious if anyone else has thought about this.  Is there a place for it?  What other games suffer from it?  Do any games lampshade it?",20,1585316683,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpx64m/the_weird_trope_of_not_playing_as_the_real_main/,Games,1

fprmlr,NeutralPhysii,"An Analysis of Massively Multiplayer Online [MMO] Games (Or: How to Create the ""Perfect"" MMO)","TL;DR AT THE BOTTOMNote: I apologize if any information about some of these games I provide is inaccurate. I haven't played some of them in many years.

# Introduction

Every year or so I get this... itch -- this desire to find an MMO game that makes me want to get lost in it. I've tried it all: Elder Scrolls Online, Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft, Black Desert Online, Path of Exile, Diablo III, Path of Exile, Destiny, Destiny 2, DayZ Mod (and DayZ SA, but we don't talk about that), Old School Runescape, Star Citizen, Pirates of the Caribbean Online, and even TOONTOWN ONLINE (side note: this game was amazing as a kid). 

Some notable exceptions are EverQuest, EVE Online, Final Fantasy XIV, and Lord of the Rings Online, but I think it's safe to assume that they would fall under the same umbrella as the aforementioned games, in terms of quality and gameplay. 

At the end of the day, though, all of these games have been... missing something. For me, anyway. These missing components vary wildly. Sometimes it's endgame content, sometimes it's early-game content. Sometimes it's PvP content, sometimes it's PvE content. Sometimes it's too mechanically easy, sometimes it's too hand-holding. I could go on all day, and most of you that have played MMOs will probably understand a similar feeling. 

Today I want to take a look at the MMO genre and what can be done to improve it. To do this, I'm going to (briefly) look at and pull some key ideas of what works from various MMO (and non-MMO games), express some of my thoughts, and then give a stipulative definition for the ""perfect"" MMO game (which, it turns out, may require destroying what defines a traditional MMO game). If you want to jump to this part, jump to the bottom. I'm going to try and be realistic about this ""perfect"" game. I realize game developers can't make this massive, trillion-dollar game that will be the end-all-be-all MMO game.

# What Works, What Doesn't, and What's Missing

**What Works:**

* Deep, non-combat skill system

Games like Runescape, Black Desert Online, and Guild Wars 2 have a great concept of providing skills outside of combat-oriented ones to invest time in. Sometimes these fall a little flat/miss the mark, but I think the idea itself is worth keeping.

* Deep, combat-oriented skill system

Most MMO games already have this down. In particular, I'll  Path of Exile as a prime example of introducing a deep skill tree, where each class can become a wide range of things. The class you chose is a guideline but does not define who you are. The fewer restrictions put on what you can be, the better.

* Deep crafting system
* Rewarding combat

I think the above two points need no major elaboration. These are fairly self-explanatory and present in most MMO games, already. 

* Consequences

Games like Runescape and DayZ do a great job of this. I'd also like to pull in what games like Dark Souls, Terraria, and Minecraft do. There are real consequences to dying in-game, ranging from losing some money to losing all of your gear. Finding the right balance to consequences and forgiving failure is important to keep people invested without them quitting.

* Non-combat activities

For this point, I'd like to call in Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto V Online as examples. These games do a great job of providing a variety of activities to do outside of combat that provide different kinds of fun, keeping the game fresh and providing some meaningful downtime. As a bonus, games like Skyrim give combat-related perks to spending time doing non-combat activities (e.g. alchemy). 

I'd also like to cite Stardew Valley as an example. This is a weird one, but let me explain. Stardew Valley has a satisfying dungeon crawler component with simple yet fun combat, yes, but the main focus of the game is farming (and fishing to a lesser extent). It is a proof-of-concept that a large group of people can find enjoyment in a game centered around seemingly ""mundane"" tasks, so long as those tasks are made interesting, engaging, and rewarding on their own. 

Flipping this idea, incorporating non-combat ideas from games like Stardew Valley to traditionally combat-oriented games can provide players of varying interests something to do. Imagine if an MMO game existed where players could find as much fulfillment from harvesting rare crops as from finding rare gear in a dungeon? And imagine if these features played off one another; for example, imagine a certain ingredient for a food item required killing an endgame boss. Rather than force every player to become good enough to do this, however, what if players interested in engame, combat-oriented content sold them to less combat-oriented players on a market? I'm thinking of something like the Trading Post from Guild Wars 2 or the Flea Market in Escape From Tarkov.

* Community

Long ago, games like World of Warcraft had a sense of ""we're in this together"". People used to queue with total strangers to complete quests, dungeons, etc. because... well, how else would you beat them? Nowadays, the reality is that it is very easy to communicate and play with your friends. People prefer to play with their friends and chat on Discord than play with total strangers through text chat. This has made the community less ""connected"" in the sense that people are less likely to look outside their friend groups for people to play with. There is also a significant subset of people that prefer to play alone.

**What Doesn't Work:**

* Catering to the casual audience

We need to be careful, here. Certainly, casual players should be welcome to play the game and should have a place. Realistically, games need to make money. The casual audience provides a lot of money; that does not, however, mean the game should be made artificially easier or simpler to compensate. It has become abundantly clear that there exists a ""hardcore vs casual"" split in the MMO player base. For a game like this to succeed, then, it needs some mediation of these two groups. I will discuss a potential solution later in the post.

* Microtransactions

Need I say more? Microtransactions have a purpose in F2P games, but they should never exceed cosmetic functionality. Providing benefits that bypass grinding is a terrible model that only serves to alienate and frustrate people.

* Unnecessary Grind

Same as above, really. A lot of games put in unnecessary grinds in order to extend the game's lifespan or (worse yet) incentive purchasing microtransactions. A grind should be long enough to make it satisfying/rewarding when you accomplish it. No more, no less. 

**What is Missing:**

I think the thing that is missing the most (and from most of these games) is meaning. Purpose. Sure, I can invest countless hours grinding for the best gear in the game, but why? What meaning does it serve? This is one of the fundamental problems I have had with MMO games in the past. Many MMOs nowadays focus on providing more content, more gear, more grind, etc. because they think more is more. I, however, think that we can do better than that. 

# The ""Perfect"" Game (the TL;DR)

Let me expand on this ""purpose"" idea more, as I'm sure many of you are not sold on this idea. To do so, I will give my current idea for the perfect MMO game. This is not going to be one cohesive game concept so much as a collection of ideas.This game has:

* Combat Roles

To combat meta-gaming taking over the game, making sure that every character has more focus on fulfilling support roles ensures that the game is more about party synergy than any one build. Games like Overwatch show us that support-based characters can function. Other Games like (yes... I'm going to say it) Toontown Rewritten also show how to make every skill valuable, making meta-gaming... kind of a moot point.

* Total content for combat and non-combat players

Total content, in this instance, means that there is sufficient content for either of these groups to get a ""full game's"" worth of experience pursuing either avenue. Players interested in farming, fishing, crafting, cooking, caravaning, etc. should have as many opportunities, incentives, and value as players interested in combat, dungeons, raids, PvP, etc.

* Focused, smaller servers

Since supporting servers for hundreds of people is too expensive to maintain, the game would instead feature something similar but smaller in scale to World of Warcraft, where areas are zoned for a specific amount of players. Similar to Guild Wars 2, each quest area could also have a matchmaking list, where people trying to complete the same quest can party up to complete it. Going one step further, perhaps it is better to make the game not hold everyone's hand. Instead of introducing a bunch of communication features/incentives that not many utilize, perhaps following a model similar to GTAV Online would work better. Players can decide whether to play in a private/public server and matchmake into quests/dungeons, as desired.

* Property

Let's make things more interesting. Let's put property into the game. In this case, many players can buy and own the same house, with each player's house serving as it's own localized area. Guild houses can function in a similar fashion. This can be extended to farmland, as well. Many players could own the same plots of land or mines. They would then choose which to buy based on the region's climate, soil, resources, etc. 

* Realm vs Realm

This idea of property can be further extended by having factions/guilds own regions of land that can be taken over. These factions would receive income/resources based on the number of people that own land, mines, shops, etc. Goods sold in the market also contribute to their land through taxes excised on each sale. These features would only affect those participating in the RvR, and would not affect the aforementioned groups directly, but it would add a whole new layer to the game. Factions could engage in politics and war that reset every season. Factions would receive RvR exclusive rewards at the end of the season based on their performance.

* Make combat *hard*

By creating separate, yet different and rewarding content for the casual players, this provides an opportunity: provide extremely challenging, yet rewarding combat. The combat can be made extremely challenging, yet incredibly lucrative for those willing to invest the time into it. 

* **Incentivizing**

This is an important one for me. Rewarding each player base for working towards their own personal, in-game goals gives the game purpose. Want to be a merchant? Here's why you *should* do that. Want to be a healer? Here's why you *should* do that. Want to be a master smither? Here's why you *should* do that. Want to buy a house? Start a farm? Here's why you *should* do that. Going one or two steps beyond the first-level purpose (e.g. ""I am grinding for this better weapon so I can fight harder stuff to get better weapons to fight harder stuff, repeat"") adds complexity to the game without adding more features. Making all of these features co-exist, depend on one another, and impossible for one person to do *everything* means that everyone has the potential to be important. Everyone contributes to the world, whether they fight, farm, craft, smith, politick, caravan, and so on.   

* No story/NPC dialogue

This is probably going to be the most contentious point, but consider this: it's a lot of work to do these things. Most people (myself included) also skip the dialogue in MMO games so I can get to playing with my friends, leveling up, and grinding. After making multiple characters, too, most players are going to skip through the story as fast as possible. Wouldn't that time be better spent focusing on other content (particularly the non-combat components)? 

* Party vs Party

Removing solo PvP altogether and replacing it with Party vs Party combat also disincentives making solo meta builds that pigeonhole endgame. 

* Consequences

The best consequences can be introduced with the best loot. Want extremely rare item drops? You have to put some gear on the line. Perhaps a model similar to Escape From Tarkov would work where, when you decide to do a dungeon or PvP (now Party vs Party, remember?), you have to put a certain amount of currency on the line. Alternatively, you could put all of the gear you are bringing into the dungeon on the line. For PvP, parties could decide whether to put their gear or a certain amount of money on the line against other parties. This could spawn a competitive league on its own, bringing a whole different player base altogether.

# Final Thoughts

This is by no means a complete list. To be honest, many of these ideas *could* turn out to be bad ones or incompatible with one another.

fpq17e,HopOnTheHype,Mad Respect For Humble Bundle Original Games (Published),"Somehow every single game that humble bundle has published has been great, that is some great batting average for a publisher.

Aegis Defender is a quite good 2d action platformer.

Them's Fightin' Herds I haven't played yet, but it's good reviews, and it looks solid (I own from a humble choice)

Wizard of Legend is a solid couch co op action game with cool magic and pretty damn fast gameplay.

The Occupation is another I haven't really touched, but it has solid reviews (like all the games humble do, and basing this off steam reviews) and it's something that's been on my radar, looks solid and unique.

Staxel isn't my type of game I'd say, but even I want to get it eventually, pretty much a stardew valley looking game with multiplayer and a charming artstyle. Good reviews as always.

Forager is honestly incredibly addicting, would suggest.

I've only heard good things about Void Bastards, I'm not much of a shooter person but the games it's inspired, it's art style, and honestly the rest of the game look great.

Crying Suns looks good, has good reviews, and is a rather unique game (all of these games are pretty much different genres and that says a lot too)

Fae Tactics is looking good even if it's not out yet, plus always good to have more quality tactics style games out there, it's a genre I quite like. 

TemTem has dethroned Pokemon as far as I'm concerned, and it's only in early access lol.

One Step From Eden looks to be well received so far, and yet again a unique game genre.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can not praise them enough for how consistently they publish great games, obviously they aren't making all the games, but they sure have a good track record of supporting solid ideas and developers, along with a very diverse number of games where almost none of the 11 really overlap. If you are looking to play some good games, I can't suggest humble bundle's published games enough, kudos to them.",3,1585280652,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpq17e/mad_respect_for_humble_bundle_original_games/,Games,1

&gt;I found myself looking at a pile of things that seemed like they would be fun, like there was a fun game under everything else, but the whole thing needed another few passes at the design stage to actually get out that fun game.

-------------

&gt;Those expecting the quality and polish of its predecessor will be disappointed with Exit the Gungeon. It's too visually clustered and the new mechanics can be more frustrating than fun. Still, for a short burst of rogue-like goodness, you could do worse.

-------------

**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Nic Vargus](https://opencritic.com/critic/5480/nic-vargus) - [7 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/exit-the-gungeon-review)

&gt;Exit the Gungeon's random gun-switching can be frustrating but it's also a chaotic challenge that makes each run fun.

-------------

**[IGN Spain](https://opencritic.com/outlet/471/ign-spain)** - *Spanish* - [6.5 / 10](https://es.ign.com/exit-the-gungeon-nintendo-switch/162046/review/analisis-de-exit-the-gungeon-para-ps4-nintendo-switch-y-pc)

&gt;Exit the Gungeon rescues the thug style of its predecessor but its main mechanics can cause a high degree of frustration in the player due to different design decisions.However, we spend a very entertaining time in a world that will be more than familiar to the fans of Enter the Gungeon, drawn with magnificent detail and care.

-------------

**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [Jon Mundy](https://opencritic.com/critic/4770/jon-mundy) - [7 / 10](http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/exit_the_gungeon)

&gt;Enter The Gungeon die-hards will be instantly familiar with the weird and wonderful world presented by Exit The Gungeon, but they might be taken aback by the shift in gameplay. This is a finely honed action-platformer that adds a new dimension to the blasting and dodge rolling. It's not always a flawless transition, and this is a significantly less rich and rewarding experience than the original. But those after a retro-tinged arcade challenge should by all means lock and load.

-------------

**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.savingcontent.com/2020/03/20/exit-the-gungeon-review/)

&gt;Exit the Gungeon isn’t a sequel, nor does it pretend to be. I still find 2016’s Enter the Gungeon to be a fuller experience, with more depth and variety. Exit the Gungeon is not a game you should ignore. This Gungeon may have lost a little bit of itself along the way, but enough of its humor and sensibilities are very much intact for enjoying Dodge Roll’s twist on the Gungeon formula for the price point. Exit the Gungeon is a delightful spin-off, a blast to play, and the changes to the gameplay compliment the new perspective wonderfully.

-------------

**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [Ozzie Mejia](https://opencritic.com/critic/278/ozzie-mejia) - [7 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/117105/exit-the-gungeon-review-the-great-escape)

&gt;Is it another Enter the Gungeon? No, it isn't. But as a quick arcade romp, it's a blast. It shows that even when shifting genres, Dodge Roll knows how to craft a good roguelike and keep players wanting to punish themselves more and more with each run.

-------------

**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - [Marino Puntorieri](https://opencritic.com/critic/5909/marino-puntorieri) - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/exit-the-gungeon-spara-e-fuggi-recensione/)

&gt;Exit the Gungeon is a good game with roguelike and shooter features, realized in a inspirate bidimensional setting. Dodge Roll created a title challenging enough to give hours of fun in front of the display.

-------------

**[The Digital Fix](https://opencritic.com/outlet/17/the-digital-fix)** - [Seb Hawden](https://opencritic.com/critic/5899/seb-hawden) - [8 / 10](https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/review/exit-the-gungeon/)

&gt;When I first heard about the change of formula for this sequel I did question it. However, what we have is something that is familiar yet fresh. Exit the Gungeon streamlines a lot of the great gameplay from the first game into something very unique, rewarding and extremely fun. I love it.

-------------

**[WayTooManyGames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/742/waytoomanygames)** - [Aaron Price](https://opencritic.com/critic/6944/aaron-price) - [8.5 / 10](https://waytoomany.games/2020/03/26/review-exit-the-gungeon/)

&gt;While Exit the Gungeon may be incredibly punishing, it may also be more inviting to new players than Enter has ever been. Returning fans, on the other hand, will have a grasp of the base mechanics, but will be far from masters of the new form of gameplay, making Exit inviting to everyone who’s a fan of the genre and style.

-------------

**[We Got This Covered](https://opencritic.com/outlet/19/we-got-this-covered)** - [Jordan Hurst](https://opencritic.com/critic/1540/jordan-hurst) - [3 / 5 stars](https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/exit-the-gungeon-review/)

&gt;Exit the Gungeon is neither as sharp nor as complete as it could be, but its foundation is so strong that it can be great fun regardless.

fpp8gx,GrahamBelmont,How important is music to you in video games?," If I were to try and create a top 10 list of my favorite games, I don't think any of them would have soundtracks that I didn't love. I find even games that would otherwise be mediocre, I'll fucking love if I really like the music. For example No More Heroes, or Metal Gear Rising. Or like I don't normally play racing games, but I used to fucking love Ridge Racer Type 4 because I loved the music. And it's not just the music, but the way it's implemented. Again with Metal Gear Rising, the way the soundtrack is largely dynamic, kicking in lyrics during phase shifts in boss fights just fucking sells it to me  


I'd honestly say music and sound design is the second most important part of a game for me  


also, what games would you say have fucking great soundtracks?",71,1585277214,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpp8gx/how_important_is_music_to_you_in_video_games/,Games,1

Critic Reviews
-------------
    

**[Attack of the Fanboy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/116/attack-of-the-fanboy)** - [Brandon Adams](https://opencritic.com/critic/6501/brandon-adams) - [3 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/bleeding-edge-review/)

&gt;The attention to detail, great soundtrack, and largely well-designed characters belie a game that is clearly loved by those that worked on it, but the crippling lack of depth in every area of Bleeding Edge has made what should have been an excellent game a mediocre one instead. I hope Ninja Theory is given the opportunity to expand on the game, but right now Bleeding Edge is fun but forgettable filler.

-------------

**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Jordan Devore](https://opencritic.com/critic/432/jordan-devore) - [6.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-bleeding-edge-584614.phtml)

&gt;There's a decent multiplayer action game concept buried in here, absolutely. Some of these characters deserve to live on in future projects. At the same time, it feels like there are only so many team dynamics to experience. It's all too fleeting. Once you've hit that point of no return, there's no real motivation to continue. I'd like to pick this back up one day, but realistically, I don't see that happening.

-------------

**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Wesley Yin-Poole](https://opencritic.com/critic/780/wesley-yin-poole) - [No Recommendation / Blank](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-26-bleeding-edge-review-fun-fighting-let-down-by-a-bare-bones-launch)

&gt;Bleeding Edge could be on to something with meaningful updates, but at launch it's Xbox Game Pass filler at best.

-------------

**[Gamerheadquarters](https://opencritic.com/outlet/337/gamerheadquarters)** - [Jason Stettner](https://opencritic.com/critic/2141/jason-stettner) - [6.7 / 10](https://gamerheadquarters.com/articles/bleeding-edge-review.html)

&gt;Bleeding Edge is fun to play, but it’s rather shallow in terms of content and has some performance issues.

-------------

**[GotGame](https://opencritic.com/outlet/657/gotgame)** - [David Poole](https://opencritic.com/critic/5725/david-poole) - [7.5 / 10](https://gotgame.com/2020/03/24/review-bleeding-edge/)

&gt;When all is said and done, Bleeding Edge does feel like a side project for the developer. While it does feel that way, there are some extremely redeeming qualities of it. The aesthetically pleasing style and the unique personality of the characters shine through the gameplay. Even though content is a little light, the game is half the price of a usual game, and it’s free on Xbox Game Pass. For what is available, the game is a lot of fun, and despite the slow progression, there’s always that feeling of “one more game” lingering.

-------------

**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - David Martínez - *Spanish* - [72 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-bleeding-edge-ninja-theory-xbox-one-pc-606607)

&gt;Bleeding Edge sets a good foundation for a game as a service. We miss some more content (game modes, characters and levels) but it feels truly satisfying when we coordinate with the rest of our teammates.

-------------

**[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - *Italian* - [7.5 / 10](https://it.ign.com/bleeding-edge-xbox-one/167634/review/bleeding-edge-la-recensione)

&gt;A very interesting ""hero slasher"" that at the moment is lacking in terms of contents and variety.

-------------

**[IGN Spain](https://opencritic.com/outlet/471/ign-spain)** - *Spanish* - [7 / 10](https://es.ign.com/bleeding-edge-xbox-one/162016/review/analisis-de-bleeding-edge-para-xbox-one-y-pc)

&gt;It is a game that comes very late to the genre that it tries to assault, but at the same time it gives it a certain originality by creating a work in which the combat mechanics are based on hack and slash and not on the simple skills of a regular hero shooter (although there are also and they are key, of course).

-------------

**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - [7 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/26/bleeding-edge-review-fight-together-die-alone-12460839/)

&gt;It often feels a little undercooked but the emphasis on teamplay and some very unusual characters offers an enjoyable alternative to other online multiplayer games.

-------------

**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - [Paolo Sirio](https://opencritic.com/critic/5447/paolo-sirio) - *Italian* - [7.3 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/bleeding-edge-recensione/)

&gt;It's a little sparse on content, but Bleeding Edge now offers a fun combat system, stable netcode and quick matchmaking, and that should be enough for a solid launch.

-------------

**[TrueAchievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/316/trueachievements)** - [Sean Carey](https://opencritic.com/critic/3367/sean-carey) - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.trueachievements.com/n41231/bleeding-edge-review)

&gt;Bleeding Edge is definitely worthy of your time – hopefully more so in the coming months when fresh content is added.

-------------

**[Twinfinite](https://opencritic.com/outlet/21/twinfinite)** - [Ed McGlone](https://opencritic.com/critic/77/ed-mcglone) - [3 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2020/03/bleeding-edge-review/)

&gt;At its core, a unique brawler game that is held back from reaching its full potential by repetitive gameplay and a lack of features that in 2020 should absolutely be standard, at launch, for any game trying to squeeze into the crowded multiplayer game market

fpmshm,happythearthur,Don't get hooked on games !? But why.,"I found out that lately I struggle to play something , as I either don't have interest or just feel bored.

Just started Shadow of Tomb Rider , but after 2 hour of gameplay I got massively bored.

Before that I replayed Horizon : Zero dawn and was hooked as I was first time playing it back in 2017 , and I would say both games are pretty on a same level of graphic just slightly different genre.

But when I Played Legend of Zelda BOTW , I literally couldn't stop playing.

And my question is ! 

Is it something wrong with me , or lots of games are not as innovative no more ?",14,1585267666,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpmshm/dont_get_hooked_on_games_but_why/,Games,1

I was interested in the sequel, so when this was announced too i figure id jump in.

Im assuming some threads here will lead into that bigger title. This was a nice little appetizer for that. It was like a prologue. It kept me intrigued which is impressive because its actually a little dull presentation wise.

It's like a ninja game where i can fly and hope over from tree to tree and shoot shurikens and use blades to kill other ninjas that try to stop me... and in the background are sounds of frequent thunders and once i enter a palace i will save a lady only to be taken again from me... Guys i vaguely remember the title... but i thibj it has a ""legend"" in it? I dunno man... I really forgot it. 

I Would really appreciate it and i think this os the best place for me to find answers... i always have big hopes to this community.",3,1585251041,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fphxez/retro_video_game_title/,Games,0

fpg25p,nukelauncher95,"In my opinion 2008, was the greatest year for gaming. What year do you consider the best?","Almost all of my favorite games of all time released in 2008.

* Metal Gear Solid 4
* Grand Theft Auto 4
* Burnout Paradise
* LittleBigPlanet
* Saints Row 2
* Mirror's Edge

In 2008 we saw Fallout 3, Left 4 Dead, I Love Katamari, Persona 4, Mario Kart Wii, Far Cry 2, Fable 2, and the Euro Truck Simulator franchise began. And the critically acclaimed iRacing simulator launched as well. I can't believe I almost forgot about that. I am super into racing sims.

2008 was huge for the fighting game community as well. We saw the revitalization of the Street Fighter franchise with Street Fighter 4 and Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix. Super Smash Bros Brawl released in 2008 too.

One of my favorite indie games is World of Goo, which came out in 2008 too. I used a Mac beck then and got it for free in a promotion. The Mac port ran beautifully on my Core 2 Duo MacBook. The world famous indie game, QWOP, released in 2008 too.

I'm sure there are other great games I'm forgetting. I'm curious what you guys think? In you opinion, what is the best year for video games?",29,1585244994,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpg25p/in_my_opinion_2008_was_the_greatest_year_for/,Games,0

fpcqbj,Plexicraft,Why is it that only the CoD community is so against SBMM?,"Skill based matchmaking is what pretty much every game made since 2005 uses to balance matches in pvp.

I hear it's a bad word (phrase/acronym) in the Apex Legends forums too but I think we can all agree the hate originated with CoD.

I'm of the opinion that as long as it doesn't place you in lobbies with worse ping, sbmm should be in every pvp game.
It should average premade group mmr as sophisticatedly as needed etc.

CoD players almost unanimously disagree usually stating they want to ""relax and enjoy a casual game"". This to me sounds more like ""I want to relax, play sub-optimally, and still win"" which I feel comes off as ridiculously entitled and egotistical.

fpaxam,G_J_Caesar,I want to talk about Songs of Syx. What do you think of this? Is this a new genre of games? a hybrid maybe?," 

Some time ago I came across a free colony Sim / city-builder / battle / strategy / pixel indie game.

Its creator, Jake, said that it was inspired by the Caesar series, Rome Total War and some other games I remember not.

The concept of the game is starting a colony with a ten person group and expand upwards of 30k people. There is farming, mining, research, combat, raids, and in the future, diplomacy, internal and external politics, commerce, happiness and unrest, weather and climate and so on.

Battles work like those of Rome TW, the city management is much like Ceaser IV and others, and there is a research tab, you can have policies and so on.

Basically, it is a game where you are a king, and rule and can do pretty much anything, including pretending to be like Gimli and be the Lord of a Glittering Caves.

The game is far from finished, its creator says so himself, and has only just started its kick starter.

Sources:

It certainly can occupy upwards of 100 hours however, it did so for me (in other words, I'm speaking from experience not out of thin air). You can find their main website here: [https://songsofsyx.itch.io/songs-of-syx](https://songsofsyx.itch.io/songs-of-syx)

Its Kickstarter which also has game information and upcoming features in greater detail can be found here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/songsofsyx/songs-of-syx](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/songsofsyx/songs-of-syx)

I apologize if this seems as a promotion. It is not. I gain nothing from the game whatsoever. I simply want to share something that I found and that I feel many other people will enjoy. I thank you all for your time reading this short message.

Cheers  


P.s. I'd love to have a discuss about it as I find it a most interesting game.  


The reason I am bringing it up is that it seems to be to be a new genre of games, linking various strategy games, city building sim games and others, together.   


I wonder whether this would classify as a new game genre, or whether it is a hybrid or simply a new entry in a pre-existing genre.  


It seems initially to point to grand strategy, but its also a city simulator, has aspects of various other genres and I cannot quite put my finger on it. Personally I dont think it is a new genre, but a hybrid uniting various of our beloved genres into each other.",4,1585226910,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpaxam/i_want_to_talk_about_songs_of_syx_what_do_you/,Games,1

fpar7c,Gabe-KC,Stop putting Dark Souls-like checkpoint systems in your games!,"Seriously, just stop with this nonsense! I have been playing Control since yesterday, and it's a great game, except what the bleeding hell is this checkpoint system?! Why are games so insistent on mimicking the bonfire checkpoints of Dark Souls? Hollow Knight did this as well, so did Jedi Fallen Order, and I absolutely LOATHED them in each!

What developers often fail to realize is that there are reasons this system works in From Soft games. They design huge, interconnected levels, where you are always making progress. Even if you die and have to repeat the last 20 minutes, you don't need to uncover every secret and optional are, because you already have the items you picked up. The only thing you need to do is safely reach the place you died. And you can do this in a whole lot of ways. You can choose to just run past enemies, you can choose to engage them if you are confident in your skills, and once you have picked up your souls, you have a multitude of items that help you quickly get back to the bonfire. Dark Souls is not a linear game, it's a game where you can approach an area 10 different ways. If you want to reach the Hydra in Darkroot Garden, you can decide to go from André's bonfire, the cave bonfire, the hidden bonfire next to the Artorias gate or from Undead Burg etc. You have multiple ways to traverse the level.

But developers seem insistent on using this checkpoint system in their games which totally don't accomodate them. In Hollow Knight you have to get through platforming sections requiring pinpoint accuracy, which gets really tedious when you have to do it every time you want to reach a boss room. Jedi Fallen Order is basically an Uncharted game in terms of gameplay. Imagine redoing the same scripted climbing and combat sections EVERY TIME you die. Fun, right?

And fucking Control doesn't need this shit either. Not when it has a combat system where you can be essentially two shot by enemies appearing behind you or shooting a rocket up your ass. Not when you can fall to your death or get killed by some random object in the environment, because the game's grotesque nature doesn't make it clear what's viable and what isn't. This game doesn't make any sense. It's not supposed to. If you have a flying phone booth in the middle of darkness, don't punish me for trying to approach it! There is no clear logic to the environment, to what kills you and what doesn't, and this is not acceptable in a game where each death sets you back 5 or 10 minutes.

Just stop this fucking nonsense. Create your own checkpoint system, one that works well within the context of your game.",51,1585226134,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fpar7c/stop_putting_dark_soulslike_checkpoint_systems_in/,Games,1

fp9x0t,trinhhainam1996,What is the good gameplay ?,"Today I read one post on resetera,  title '' To those of you that always prioritize story over gameplay: Why? ''. I think many people misunderstand gameplay = combat. I think combat mechanic just one part of total gameplay. Gameplay is every interact with game. Great gameplay ( for me ), include:

\-Great combat system ( combat mechanic, weapon system, inventory system, upgrade system,..)

\-Level and world design of exploration ( Artstyle, Environment, atmosphere, great sense exploration,..)

\-Combat encouter design ( Enemies design, enemies placement, combat encouter,..)

Example, games have great gameplay but meh story for me:

\-Resident evil 4 ( great level design, combat mechanic, counter design,atmosphere, garbage story and diagloue )

\-Soulsbornekiro ( I not speak they have bad story but story is very minor part of experience, they all known for Art style, level design, combat, atmosphere, enemies design, boss fight )

\-Half life 2 ( great pacing, level design, combat encounter, varies location, average story )

\-Re2 remake ( great level design, atmosphere, pacing, combat encounter, average story )

And Dead space1+2, Far cry 3, Doom 2016, Gta sa,... I play all of them for gameplay, not story

Game have great story but average gameplay for me:

\-The last of us

\-Deadly Promonition ( garbage gameplay )

\-Red dead 2

...

And, not every game have gameplay include combat, example, Witcher 3, I have heard game have bad gameplay form many people, but when i play this game, combat swordplay just 15-20 % total time gameplay, rest is conversation, choice. Choose conversion is very important part of gameplay witcher 3, and i think it very excellent.

fp7ql4,scattthewaz,Help Please,"Hello everyone, I am in a pickle. I need help deciding what to do. In context I am a teenager and enjoy Scott the Woz a lot lol. So much so, that on my YouTube channel, I want to make content like him. I want to know how to grow since that demographic seems pretty small. But the big thing is, I want to make a Easter special like he does at the end of the year. However, I am limited to a house and a large backyard. I collect old consoles and games, so I have plenty of content ideas and such. For example, I was thinking of doing the special on WWF No Mercy for the N64, and I had it all layed out, until I released it was very close to the It's Awesome Baby episode. I don't want to just copy him, because I used some of his jokes for a video I did on E3 1995. Any help and suggestions would be helpful. I will also leave a link to my YouTube channel if you're interested in this special I'm going to try to do.

fp7ikf,DKLond,Half-Life: Avatar - my review.,"Remember Avatar, the movie?  


Well, this is more or less like that, just in game form.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a visual spectacle - above and beyond what we've seen before. It's going to make a lot of developers (or rather publishers) scramble to think of ways VR could probably be a part of future AAA titles - and it's going to make gamers and reviewers alike ignore the heart of the matter, which would be the gameplay.  


That's not to say it's a bad game, because it's not. It does what it sets out to do - and it does so very well indeed.  


But, at heart, it's baby's first Half Life.   


You have three weapons with a few modifications. You have small cramped levels - mostly consisting of corridors and samey enemies thrown at you over and over. You have a single resource beyond ammo to really worry about, which would be the ""Resin"" - and that's about it. The story is light (which was always the case with HL) - and exploration is about peeking behind boxes.  


That is it.  


If you take out the VR - this is a thoroughly underwhelming game. It's a very basic shooter that just happens to be absolutely beautiful and captivating in VR. The immersion is through the roof - and everything is executed with million-dollar detail.  


So, if you like the spectacle and you don't really emphasize gameplay in your experience - then this is the game for you.  


I can't ""not"" recommend it, because it really is something else. But once the dust settles, people will realise this wasn't really a great game.

Dont get me wrong, I like the cheeky bastard. Hes likable, has a goofy boyish face, and he seems like a relatively decent human being.

But what is with all the lies? Anyone have a theory on how or why this happens? I'm starting to wonder if its not just blatant deception but rather ignorance, like he hasn't actually played the games and is reading off a script when he starts telling tales. Actually I'm not sure which one is worse.

Fallout 76 clearly didnt have 16 times the detail, Bethesda knew that.

**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Julian Bieder](https://opencritic.com/critic/3391/julian-bieder) - *German* - [8.4 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/iron-danger-review-zeitmanipulation-in-einem-kampf-zwischen-riesigen-mechs-und-wikingern/)

&gt;The unique selling point for Iron Danger is the time manipulation mechanic, which works admirably in combat situations. Made a mistake? Just rewind time! It is just plain fun to redo your tactical approaches until everything works perfectly. A must play for anybody, who wants to try something new in this kind of genre.

-------------

**[Cultured Vultures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/537/cultured-vultures)** - [WB Mason](https://opencritic.com/critic/4157/wb-mason) - [7 / 10](https://culturedvultures.com/iron-danger-pc-review-a-unique-yet-flawed-dungeon-crawler/)

&gt;Iron Danger won’t change your world, but it’s a wholly unique game that may well appeal to dungeon crawling fans.

-------------

**[GameCrate](https://opencritic.com/outlet/155/gamecrate)** - [Justin Woo](https://opencritic.com/critic/4272/justin-woo) - [8.3 / 10](http://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-iron-danger-indie-strategy-crowd-pleaser/25524)

&gt;If Iron Danger was the third game from a veteran indie studio, I'd be impressed. It's Action Squad Studios' first outing. I'm blown away. While it can occasionally be rough around the edges, I can't wait to see what they do next.

-------------

**[GameSkinny](https://opencritic.com/outlet/421/gameskinny)** - [Jordan Baranowski](https://opencritic.com/critic/5749/jordan-baranowski) - [7 / 10 stars](http://www.gameskinny.com/r62x3/iron-danger-review-rewound-tactics)

&gt;Iron Danger lacks the polish or depth to appeal much beyond that interesting concept. A lot of people will have fun with Iron Danger, but I could also see it being a game that many load up and ultimately bounce off of.

-------------

**[Gamer's Palace](https://opencritic.com/outlet/741/gamers-palace)** - [Manuel Eichhorn](https://opencritic.com/critic/6924/manuel-eichhorn) - *German* - [81 / 100](https://gamers-palace.de/iron-danger-pc-im-test-taktische-kaempfe-zum-zusammenbauen/)

&gt;Iron Danger prides itself in its combat and time manipulation system. It does so well deserved. The game's second highlight is the wonderful world. Levels are small, but varied and just beautiful. It's a pity there aren't more interaction possibilities outside of combat and that the narrating remains rather dull. Friends of tactical gameplay (and great worlds) shall take a look at Iron Danger!

-------------

**[GamingTrend](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend)** - [Codi Spence](https://opencritic.com/critic/4264/codi-spence) - [75 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/if-i-could-turn-back-time-iron-danger-review/)

&gt;Iron Danger is an interesting story of a young woman who obtains magical powers from a shard impaling her. The tactical combat and ARPG mechanics make for clever gameplay and a lack of grinding, although some fights are frustrating. The story itself is good, but the ending drags it down a lot by leaving you unsatisfied and wanting more.

-------------

**[God is a Geek](https://opencritic.com/outlet/111/god-is-a-geek)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [6.5 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/iron-danger-review/)

&gt;Iron Danger as an experience relies so heavily on the time-travel combat mechanic that it doesn't really present you with much besides that. Everything else is a little bit bare bones.

-------------

**[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - *Italian* - [7.6 / 10](https://it.ign.com/iron-danger-pc/167535/review/iron-danger-la-recensione)

&gt;Daedalic's take on tactical combat is unique and refreshing, making for a robust gameplay that is also enriched by an interesting setting inspired by Finnish folklore.

-------------

**[Player2.net.au](https://opencritic.com/outlet/520/player2-net-au)** - [Matt Hewson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3904/matt-hewson) - [B+](https://www.player2.net.au/2020/03/iron-danger-a-unique-trip-through-time/)

&gt;“Iron Danger feels like a breath of fresh air for CRPGs. While not a perfect game, its unique, time-based combat system is a pure joy to play with and worth the price of admission alone.”

-------------

**[RPG Site](https://opencritic.com/outlet/322/rpg-site)** - [Adam Vitale](https://opencritic.com/critic/1854/adam-vitale) - [6 / 10](http://www.rpgsite.net/review/9577-iron-danger-review)

&gt;The unique time manipulating tactics make this game an interesting strategy game, but also a somewhat tedious one.

-------------

**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - Branislav Koh�t - *Slovak* - [7.5 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/36566/iron-danger.htm)

&gt;Likable RPG with unique time manipulation mechanic and solid story is not perfect, but amusing for sure.

-------------

**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [3 / 5 stars](https://www.savingcontent.com/2020/03/23/iron-danger-review/)

&gt;Over the course of fifteen or so hours to see the game to completion, Iron Danger offers a good challenge, even on the default normal difficulty. The ability to infinitely bend time to your will to fine-tune encounters to perfection can be really satisfying. Its biggest detriment is how clunky and unpolished it all feels. That said, Iron Danger is really fun, and completely distinct from every other tactical combat game you’ve played. And for that, it should be on your radar.

-------------

**[Screen Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/664/screen-rant)** - [Peter Morics](https://opencritic.com/critic/6608/peter-morics) - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://screenrant.com/iron-danger-review/)

&gt;Iron Danger is a tactical RPG that gives you full control over time itself and turns combat into a puzzle.

-------------

**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - [Nicolò Paschetto](https://opencritic.com/critic/4822/nicol-paschetto) - *Italian* - [7.6 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/iron-danger-pc/iron-danger-recensione/)

&gt;Of the many ingredients of Iron Danger, the combat system is for sure the best designed and comes across as fresh and interesting. I can't say the same for the RPG and narrative components though: not bad, but not excellent either.

forx6u,ElectricalPudding,Animal Crossing: New Horizons online multiplayer with more than two people is one of the most user unfriendly experiences you can possibly have in gaming.,"Let me tell you about the horror that is people opening their island to others to freely invite co-op play: 

* Every single time someone arrives, whether you're host or guest, a bell rings and [this](https://imgur.com/a/IpDPg22) message flies over the screen from right to left. While this happens, you cannot move or do *anything* during this. This message, depending on the connection, usually repeats itself 2-3 times.

* If you happen to be in a conversation or have anything open at that time, you'll see [this](https://imgur.com/a/bhSXcBB) message instead. After which the above arrival message repeats itself. Still, you cannot move.

* After that, the screen goes dark for loading. After which it saves. After it finished, you'll see [this screen](https://imgur.com/a/QWJvgeL) on which you follow the person arriving from their home to the island. 

* After that, you'll watch the new guest [arrive](https://imgur.com/a/kfBRzWO) in a little sequence.

* Then you get to play again. But what's that? In the meantime another guest queued up to come? Guess you only get to take **three steps** before the whole thing starts again!

Oh btw, everytime someone leaves **the same sequence starts again** just with ""someone's leaving"" instead of ""someone's arriving"" as message. Even when someone has enough of this BS, and they just cap the connection, you'll have to watch a message saying ""someone left silently."".

So if you plan to actually utilize the online with more than your closest friend, for example to traded turnips with a redditor who's kind enough to post his code on a day they're worth a lot, brace yourself for the most miserable and infuriating experience in your life. Because it can take literally 10mins to get from the airport to the turnip girl with this shit, when it usually takes less than 1min. Because you constantly get interrupted.

foolt1,Secret-Lecture,"Blazing fast SSDs are going to revolutionize games, and Microsoft would be wise to charge an extra $20 per console and include a SSD that offers speeds closer to the PS5s","Free roam games currently reuse the same assets again and again, and have barely any characters to have complex interactions with in the free roam worlds. This is due to HDD speed. Slow HDD mean things take time to load into the ram, so you need tricks to make people wait while you load up new assets from the HDD into the ram. This is why more complex games are basically corridor shooters.

In Halo, you kill everyone in one area, then you walk across a narrow bridge or take a long elevator ride to get to an area that looks different than the previous area. Or you open a door to enter an area that reuses the same assets as the area you just left, same textures, same enemies, same objects, just placed in different locations. All of this is because it takes too long to load new assets into the ram.

An extremely fast ssd that could fill up the entire ram pool in a second, in the time it takes to turn your character, would enable much richer and more diverse open world games where different parts of the level actually look different but only if the game is designed to take advantage of very fast ssds and the ability to rapidly swap data into and out of the ram.

The Series X is poised to launch at $499. And it will be sold out all year due to production shortages and resellers will turn around and sell it for $999. I would prefer that MS puts in a faster SSD and launch the console for $549 or even $599 and market it as the premier gaming experience. Release the lockhart at $349 for budget conscious gamers and lower the price of both next year once production ramps up and prices fall.

It would cost MS $15-20 to upgrade the ssd from the current 2.5gb/s ssd to a 3.8gb/s ssd raw speed allowing 7.6gb/s compressed speed (much closer to the PS5’s SSD speed, and fast enough to fill up the entire ram pool in the time it takes to turn your in game character around which basically allows assets to be streamed into view on the fly without any popup, and would completely eliminate all loadtimes since the ram pool could be filled up almost instantly). It would also mean no ram would have to be allocated to the OS, devs get access to the full 16gbs of ram and the os could instead be stored on the ssd instead of the ram when in a game. Microsoft could stick any 2.5gb/s ssds that they bulk ordered into their surface devices and order a fresh batch of 3.8gb/s ssds for the Xbox. 

It would basically be equivalent to the PS4’s surprise 8gb of ram announcement (that also seemed equally unlikely until it actually happened and the internet went absolutely nuts), but this time it would be Microsoft surprising everyone with significantly higher than expected specs at the last minute.

Now say it would cost them $15 to upgrade to 20gb of ram (14gb running at a high clock speed and 6gb for low clock speed functions such as audio, os, app switching and share features). And say it would cost them $15-20 to upgrade to a higher watt power supply and higher speed fan that would supply enough power to the console to clock the gpu at 2ghz to make it a 14TF console (the ps5 gpu is clocked at 2.3ghz while the series x gpu is clocked at 1.8ghz).

Would you happily pay an extra $50 for the Series X if it came with those three upgrades over the currently announced specs?

Would Microsoft be making a mistake spending and charging an extra $50 per unit to make those three upgrades to ensure the Series X remains superior to both the PS5 and to average gaming PCs in every single respect for the whole generation?

Microsoft wouldn’t have to stick with just the $550 console. They could still eventually release a Lockhart Xbox with similar specs except for a 500gb SSD 3.8gb/s and 5TF gpu to target 1080p tvs only for $350 and have a console for price concious customers

To really take advantage of the SSD, I really hope Microsoft doesnt mandate any more first party games be forced to run on Xbox One consoles or on any PCs with nonSata4 ssds inside. It would be sad if you we had to wait for years to see a game that fully takes advantage of SSD speeds to eliminate load times entirely and offer up diverse open world games that actually feel open and full of variety.

I am considering the PS5 due to the fact that I hate load times and anticipate that Half Life Alyx will be released on PSVR2 but if MS packs a beefier SSD, I would happily pay $600 for the Xbox Series X at launch and forego the PS5 (doubly so if Microsoft announces support for the vive or index or oculus so that i could play Half Life Alyx on xbox).

#The consoles are going to have massive shortages all year anyways, so people will be reselling them for $1000 at launch. Microsoft should just beef up the SSD and launch at $600 (it will sell out regardless) and announce Lockhart at $350 for next year for price sensitive consumers. Prices will fall next year and they will have such a superior console that even PC gamers would envy it.",21,1585135073,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/foolt1/blazing_fast_ssds_are_going_to_revolutionize/,Games,1

fonc62,RamsesThePigeon,"A Spoiler-Free Review of ""Half-Life: Alyx""","First and foremost, no, your eyes aren't deceiving you: This really is a text post in /r/Gaming.

I thought you folks might like to read an honest assessment of *Half-Life Alyx*, though.

------

**Overview**

For the precious few of you who might not be aware, *Half-Life: Alyx* is a prequel to *Half-Life 2*. It follows Alyx Vance making her way through a Combine-controlled city, intent on... well, I did say that I wouldn't be offering any spoilers.

Anyway, the game is a VR-only title, meaning that most folks probably won't get to play it right away. With that said, if you've just been waiting for the right time to purchase a VR setup of some variety, this might actually be it. It has been my personal experience that most options in the space are either ports of existing games (like *Skyrim*) or barely more than physics simulators. *Alyx*, on the other hand, feels like both an immersive experience and an adventure that was explicitly designed for virtual reality.

**Gameplay**

Jumping into the game is not at all unlike starting a playthrough of *Half-Life 2*. The environment, the characters, and even things like the soundscape are very true to the series, and the transition to virtual reality has vastly improved the experience. Interacting with someone (or something) brings with it a sense that they're actually present in the room with you, and that's as much a result of the remarkably detailed design choices. I spent my first half-hour just picking things up and examining them, and there were times when I genuinely forgot that I was in an electronic world. (At one point, I picked up a shockingly realistic bread roll, and then – without even thinking about what I was doing – tried to bring it up to my face in order to smell it.)

The gameplay proper is equally captivating: Making use of the tools and weapons that you're given becomes instinctive almost immediately, and the precious few prompts that the player receives are hardly necessary. A brief tutorial section (which mainly focuses on VR-specific mechanics) precedes the start of the action, but it's presented in an organic and believable way that makes sense in context. Interacting with the environment can occasionally make it seem like Alyx possesses remarkably enhanced strength, but that minor necessity can be explained away by the presence of a certain in-game item.

With all of that said, the title isn't without its issues.

**Controls**

I've been playing on an Oculus Rift, the controls for which are native to the game. Even so, the process of moving through the world can feel a little bit counter-intuitive at times, particularly when the player is attempting to navigate around corners. (Some of that may have been because I was using the ""teleportation"" option instead of one which allows locomotion, but I didn't want to end up barfing before I'd gotten a good impression of things.) Alyx's hands tend to ""snap"" to things whenever a given puzzle requires a little bit of finesse, especially if she's standing too close to the objects in question. The player is also limited in the ways that they can hold things, meaning that if you're hoping to keep a gun ready while you try to interact with certain things, you're out of luck. Finally, the process of switching between tools, hands, and firearms isn't exactly conducive to fast actions in the middle of firefights... which is arguably realistic, but still immersion-breaking at times.

The lack of melee combat is also a noteworthy sore spot. Yes, the player can throw objects at enemies in order to knock them off-balance, but that's about the extent of what's possible. There were times – more than a few of them, if I'm honest – when I would have loved to have been able to whack an approaching aggressor with my recently emptied shotgun, but I wound up doing an inane sort of interpretive dance instead. At one point, I tried to use the lid of a container as a shield, but attacks just wound up clipping through it.

**Story**

The story is somewhat trope-filled and predictable, but that actually works to its benefit in many ways. After all, the game being a prequel means that we don't really feel any sense of mystery about certain elements... but at the same time, many of the narrative beats manage to fill in details that we might not have known were missing. More negatively, there's the occasional sensation of being led around by the hand (and of being almost literally told what to expect before it happens), which can be slightly frustrating. There are still options for exploration, but don't expect to follow certain paths until the game gives you permission.

**Conclusion**

On the whole, the problems are all fairly minor. The new features introduced by the game do bring some questions to mind about the series as a whole, but they all work wonderfully in the context of the title. Loading, aiming, and firing guns feels remarkably true to life (and that's from someone with over a hundred hours at a real-world range), and there's a real sense of being *present* in the world. Rather than being a not-quite-perfect port or a proof-of-concept-style game, *Half-Life: Alyx* is very close to being what many of us have long hoped for from virtual reality.

**TL;DR:** ***Half-Life: Alyx*** **is an 8.5/10. If you were waiting to buy a VR headset, this is the game for it.**",3,1585128127,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fonc62/a_spoilerfree_review_of_halflife_alyx/,Games,1

fomy1x,biosignal,Do you think knowing the exact length of a videogame is a spoiler?,"Hello!

As title, how much of a spoiler is it the exact length of a title? We can be talking about either the number of chapters or missions to finish the main story.

I'm asking so because I've been ""spoiled"" the number of missions a game I was looking forward to has, and I've been trying to realize whether it is actually a spoiler or not.

I don't like to know when games I really like end, because I want them to last as much as possible.

I did some extensive benchmarks yesterday, putting Mechwarrior 5 and the new Nvidia 445.75 drivers, looking at the new DLSS 2.0 in terms of both performance and visual gains compared to not enabling it, as well as comparing the 3 tiers, Performance, Balanced and Quality.

[https://www.ozarc.games/dlss2-benchmarks-mechwarrior5/](https://www.ozarc.games/dlss2-benchmarks-mechwarrior5/)

DLSS in itself is definitively amazing, offering massive gains, but DLSS 2.0 performed less that I had hoped and Nvidia claimed.

foldsg,Brandon_Me,Doom Eternal made my stomach drop (Minor spoilers),"I've been on a bit of a video game kick recently. After playing through and loveing Ori, I took the next obvious step and played Doom 2016! I thought Eternal is Comming out soon and I've yet to try 2016 let's give it a go.

Well I ended up loveing it! It's honestly some of the most fun I've ever had in a shooter. It felt so weighty, had an interisting minimal story, had some top notch level and word design, and finished with me literally wired for more! (what a cliffhanger!)

Well I got and installed Doom Eternal, launch it up and start a new save and boom not even 5 minutes in and something feels wrong. The story seems incredibly messy, and doesn't make any sense considering the last game, and all this weighty/interisting world/level design is just gone. I'm just picking up radioactive green guns that magically float in the air and my punches have lost all ""punch"".

Ultimately I got through the first level and all my excitement for the game had vanished. It doesn't feel anything like the last one. Even the gunplay makes me feel I'm being tricked with all the weird noises and again lack of punch.

I think they made a first person shooter that is trying to invoke the likes of Bayonetta, DMC and games of such ilk. Which is fine, there is definitely a market for that, but boy did it take the wind out of my sails.

I truely hope everyone who gets their hands on it are loveing the game, but I just wanted to put out my experience in case anyone with tastes like mine were really thinking on this one.",18,1585116887,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/foldsg/doom_eternal_made_my_stomach_drop_minor_spoilers/,Games,1

foe9wz,deusfaux,"Despite the title, they're not ports. Overlooked games?","In lieu of Doom 64's re-release - where more or less a very different game (all visual assets, music, level design, etc are unique from original Doom) escaped my attention for years because I assumed it to be a port of the original -

I'm curious about other titles r/games think are worthy of playing and are likely overlooked because the title suggests they are a straightforward port or perhaps a crappy derivative in a series. 

Another example is Donkey Kong (1994) for GameBoy. If you didn't know better, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was a port of the arcade classic, but it's so so much more - making some greatest of all time lists, even. I didn't play it until last year. 

So, what others are more than their name suggests?",4,1585087582,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/foe9wz/despite_the_title_theyre_not_ports_overlooked/,Games,1

fodbl5,xxxgreekwarrior46xxx,Why people say Hack and Slash games are mindless button mashers?,"Hack and Slash/Melee Weapon Action games are one of my favorite genres, and just out of curiosity I wonder who are the people that spread this crap that Hack and Slash games are mindless button mashers and people actually believe them.

I mean why do they even say that? I have probably played most good Hack and Slash games and out of all of those that I have played only Dynasty Warriors had button mashing, I am not talking about Diablo clones by the way.

Unless they play on Easy Mode, in that case this is as stupid as whining that you cannot kill dragons in Call Of Duty or that you cannot drive a car in God Of War. From my experience the beginning section in Normal Mode the game is intentionally easy in most of those games so that you can learn the game mechanics and then later on the game gets serious.

Proof of that is God Of War 2, I played the game 4 months ago on Normal, the moment you reach the second boss and later on the game kicks your butt if you don't play it normally, and don't even make me talk about the late game and the Challenge Of The Titans.

So let me be straight, STOP CALLING HACK AND SLASH GAMES MINDLESS BUTTON MASHERS just because you played all of those games on Easy Mode and people actually believe that crap.",14,1585084395,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fodbl5/why_people_say_hack_and_slash_games_are_mindless/,Games,0

focuqy,Theonesuperx,I guess I wont be able to enjoy Animal Crossing New Horizon.,"I share my switch and I never had  a single problem doing so until this game with its profile feature. My sister loves Animal Crossing loves Animal Crossing and I am just trying to get into it, so of course she went first. But I realize playing it that I am pretty much very limited, cant donate to the museum, cant modify the town in anyway, miss out on information.   Is there no way to bypass this? Get my own island. I would just buy  my own game, but sadly the way saves work, that is not a choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Every animal crossing game had it where you share a town, but you could also use a memory card on gamecube and wii , and on 3DS, the saves were saved to the game cart. NIntendo decided it would be a good idea to not make a cloud save and limit it to one main file a console? Just so bullshit and this is their big release so far this year which sucks for me as a switch owner.   I am just disappointed in this design choice and no, I will not buy an other switch.",2,1585082872,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/focuqy/i_guess_i_wont_be_able_to_enjoy_animal_crossing/,Games,1

fnz2oz,shocktarts17,Tokyo Mirage Sessions and its poorly designed game overs,"Game overs are already a frustrating time in any game, but TMS has found a way to make them even more so some how.

For those not familiar with the game, in TMS when you get a game over you lose everything you've done since the last save.  This by itself is somewhat annoying by itself but 10x more so because there is no auto-save feature, so if you haven't saved in the last hour you lost an hour's worth of progress.  These together are annoying but some games have similar methods, which are often used as a way to add difficulty to tough games with save points being at set locations and to prevent you from ""save scuming"" your way through the game.  The worst thing about this is that TMS doesn't do that, you can save at any time.  And with no random encounters there is nothing stopping you from saving before every single combat, other than the pure tedium of it.

So this means that not only am I being punished for loosing, I'm being extra punished because I am not playing like a weeny and saving before every fight.  And since in most modern games you either have checkpoints or autosave, saving while still playing is just not something I think about often so more often than not every single game over means I'm going back to where I was when I turned the game back on.

All of this came to a head tonight when I was running around doing some fairly tedious sidequests for like an hour when I was presented with a sidequest that took me back to a dungeon I've already completed to fight an extra boss.  I've done several other quests like this at this point and every other one has been appropriate level for me, if not occasionally underleveled.  But despite the game offering this quest to me, and no indication that this quest or boss would be any harder, I was presented with a boss 10+ levels over my characters.  Can't run and the items that allow you to escape won't work so I now have to go forward with this pointless exercise where I do paltry damage to the boss while he slowly wipes me out, all the while fuming because I know I haven't saved since I started playing an hour ago because the rest of the sidequests had been painfully easy.

The whole thing makes me wonder how a modern game can mess this up so badly.  There is no excuse other than poor game design, and every game over makes me question whether or not I want to bother even playing the game again. /endrant

In the spirit of discussion, what are some other modern games with poorly designed saves/game-overs?",5,1585024900,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fnz2oz/tokyo_mirage_sessions_and_its_poorly_designed/,Games,1

fnutiw,SuperV1234,Half-Life Alyx is a step backwards from Boneworks and The Walking Dead in terms of VR immersion and interaction.,"I cannot recommend Half-Life Alyx **in its current state** to VR players looking for a fully immersive experience. The issues I will describe below are all fixable.

I played for slightly more than 3 hours in a row. So far, I like it, but it is not blowing my mind, and it has a lot of issues. I think this game is excellent for newcomers to VR, but will not satisfy people wanting a more complete and innovative experience like Boneworks or TWD: S&amp;S.

Let me explain before you lash out at me.

Environments, graphics, and atmosphere are amazing. Probably my favourite part of the game so far. The dialogue is a little bit too lighthearted at times (given the circumstances), but it is good as well.

My issues mostly stand with gameplay design decisions and lack of customization options.

The first thing I tried to do was smash a zombie on the head with a plank and then a metal tube. They just slid off of the zombie, causing no damage and reacting unrealistically. I found myself trying to punch headcrabs multiple times, doing absolutely zero damage. Not being able to use melee attacks was incredibly jarring and disorienting in a game that revolves around physics.

Smooth locomotion, which is the way I want to play, is also severely flawed. The walking speed is way too low. Please let me run away from threats. It just feels infuriating when Alyx is casually walking away from combines shooting at her instead of running. There have been situations where I wanted to sprint to cover, only to have Alyx slowly walk towards it.

There is no jump mechanic at all. What we get is just a teleportation mechanic that is insultingly called a ""jump"", without any animation or restriction. In fact, I found myself abusing the ""jump"" mechanic to navigate long corridors because the walking speed was just too frustratingly low. There are some places in the game where you are forcibly teleported (e.g. going through a window).

Smooth turning (which is my preferred way to play) is also bugged: toggling the in-game option doesn't do anything. Also, when you fall from a height you just float like a feather. That is incredibly disorienting for me, and ruins my immersion.

Inventory management and weapon handling is also extremely flawed. First of all, I can store infinite full magazines in my backpack, but as soon as I shoot a bullet, I cannot put the magazine back in my backpack. This is, again, infuriating. Let me deal with the consequences of storing a non-full magazine, if I want to. I can also store infinite resin in the backpack, but not a single grenade! This is absolutely an immersion killer. The ""wrist slots"" are quite inconvenient to use during combat, especially the main hand one.

Boneworks and TWD:S&amp;S have an holster system which works much much more nicely. TWD:S&amp;S also has an incredibly well thought-out backpack mechanic where you can hold any items you want with limited space. It is just silly that Alyx can carry hundreds of bullets and resins but only two grenades.

Furthermore, you cannot drop your gun at all. It is attached to your hand, even if you're not gripping the controller. Other than being immersion breaking, this means that you cannot switch hand from right to left to fire from a left corner without exposing your entire body. It also means you cannot throw your gun as a last resort to stagger or kill an enemy and so on. Also, you can't obviously dual-wield. Not being able to let your gun go is puzzling, especially since this game was designed for the Knuckles.

Before you say ""but that would mean that people lose items behind by accident""... think again. Letting a gun go doesn't necessarily mean it needs to fall on the ground. It could be returned to your holster after a few seconds automatically in a non immersion-breaking way, via gravity gloves.

Weapons are selected through a menu. A menu! In a VR game! We've had plenty of releases showing how weapons can be stored in holsters attached to your body, or to your back. This is another immersion killer.

Finally, getting ammunition from your shoulder is very awkward. Most other games have a pouch either on the hip or the front which makes a lot more sense and is way more comfortable.

Another issue with the game is the insane amount of hand-holding and linearity. An invisible wall was blocking me from entering a dark area because I had no flashlight yet. Just let me go in if I want, and suffer the consequences! Invisible walls are the most immersion breaking thing, especially in VR. And no, some voice lines do not make it better.

It also seems, so far, that most puzzles and levels have a single possible solution. E.g. grab the yellow keycard, find the blue keycard, and so on. It would have been more interesting if there were multiple ways to progress further, or optional areas with optional puzzles a la Boneworks. Hopefully this gets better further in.

This amount of hand-holding is also completely against the spirit of previous Half-Life games. Imagine an invisible wall stopping you from going to the test chamber in Half-Life 1 because you forgot to pick up a HEV Battery from Gordon's locker, and having a scientist telling you that ""maybe you forgot something in your locker"". Just let me deal with the consequences of my actions, and learn from them!

To recap, these are my main problems with the game:
* No melee attacks at all.
* Smooth locomotion is too slow.
* Smooth turning does not work.
* ""Jumping"" is just teleportation in disguise, and can be abused to go faster.
* Forced teleportation in many areas of the game.
* Inventory management makes no sense (no limits for certain objects, severe limits for others).
* Forced to discard non-full magazines.
* Getting ammunition from over the shoulder is awkward.
* No ammunition pouch on the hip or front of the body.
* Weapons are selected through a menu.
* No way to holster my guns on my body.
* I cannot let go of a weapon.
* I cannot use my non-dominant hand to hold a weapon.
* Very linear and ""hand-holding"" gameplay.

I understand completely that accessibility to VR newcomers was a priority for this game. However, that doesn't mean that customization options for more experienced players could have not been added. I am very disappointed in seeing that a forward-thinking company like Valve forgot about a sizeable chunk of their fan base who love hardcore and immersive experiences, like their previous Half-Life games.

Nevertheless, the game isn't ""bad"". It's just ""good"". At the moment, I would give it a 7/10. I cannot recommend it for veterans like me, however, so this is why the review is negative. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the future and I'll be able to recommend this game.",104,1585007588,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fnutiw/halflife_alyx_is_a_step_backwards_from_boneworks/,Games,1

I can verify if needed. The situation here is dire and they used GameStop’s controversy to fly under the radar when I was hoping it would instead get them in hot water too.

But now, after 3 days of having confirmed cases in my city with some originating from literally a football field away, we’re still open under “business as usual”. The entire company (all 500+ locations) is as well. Corporate is “working from home” while myself and many others are exposed in the front lines.

We are still taking trades of any and all kinds. Our VP of sales instructed us [not to wear gloves because he “read an article”](https://imgur.com/D7ukR5h). Our managers have bought us [CLEANING wipes with *no disinfectant* as well as alcohol that is only 50%](https://imgur.com/kZ5O6tv). They also told us to **not sanitize discs, just the boxes and not do the fronts of cartridges to protect the labels**. Chairs and tables are still out for the public to sit at. Card singles (which can’t be sanitized) are still out in the floor for the public to touch.

Several employees at my store have family that is immunocompromised. I had an employee break down in tears over this last night. They are deflecting any and all criticism in social media or just outright censoring it, and any attempts I make to kick up dust about the subject has been drowned out by GameStop’s controversy.

We have brought our grievances up but they are falling on deaf ears because of our numbers.

fnqv8l,AreYouOKAni,[ESSAY\REVIEW] How Doom Eternal's Brilliant Design Discourages Experimentation,"    I am not a professional critic, nor a game developer. I am just a passionate amateur that enjoys taking the game systems apart and seeing what really makes them tick. 
    
    Everything listed here is my opinion only and may not reflect the objective reality.

Doom Eternal is an extremely polished game. Most of the accolades it has earned are true, and I can definitely see it being an example, and inspiration, for further games in the FPS genre. However, its biggest strength — a tight, well-oiled, gameplay loop — is also its biggest weakness. 

**WARNING!!! MINOR ENEMY AND WEAPON SPOILERS AHEAD!**

# THE BALLET OF BULLETS

From the very beginning, Doom Eternal shows that you are not on Mars anymore. And I am not talking about the ruins of a metropolis where you begin your ripping and tearing crusade — I am talking about your ammo count. By default, your Combat Shotgun holds 16 rounds, with completely upgraded Praetor Suit and Sentinel Crystal pumping it up to 24. Since even weak Unwilling can take two shots to go to sleep, you will burn through those rounds fast.

It is by design, of course — being low on ammo requires that you go into close-range combat and use your chainsaw to gain more ammo. To accommodate it, the Chainsaw regenerates fuel on a 30-second cooldown. And in order for you not to overstay your welcome in the melee range, the standard melee is now used only to push enemies away, dealing very little damage. The same Unwilling that went down in Doom Eternal in two punches (or, technically, a punch and a Glory Kill), now takes a whopping 12-18. In fact, it is more likely to kill you in a punch-out, than go down itself. 

This creates a dynamic, where you want to be away from enemies but at the same time have to go in close quarters to get very much necessary Ammo and Health Pickups. Later on, you will acquire a (once again, close-range) Flamethrower, which will complete the trifecta and let you gain Armor. This constant switching between CQC and ranged combat like this are the first steps of what Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin call “a Doom Dance” — the core Doom Eternal gameplay loop. 

# THE SYMPHONY OF DOOM

The Doom Dance is a lot more scripted than you might think. The first time you encounter a Cacodemon, the game will tell you to pull out your shotgun and launch a Sticky Bomb at the Caco’s mouth. This will stagger the demon and allow you to perform a Glory Kill on him — Doom Slayer will jump up, stab the demon in the mouth, and pull out its eye in an admittedly groovy fashion. 

You see, at least half of your enemies have such weaknesses — here’s an incomplete list from the first couple of levels. I do not consider these spoilers since the game straight up tells you this info before the first encounter with a demon.

**Arachnotron** — Use Sticky Bomb or Precision Shot to disable the turret.

**Cacodemon** — Make it swallow a Sticky Bomb or a Grenade.

**Carcass** — Overload his shield with a Plasma Rifle.

**Cybermancubus** — Rip his armor off with a Blood Punch.

**Mancubus** — Shoot his arm-cannons off with Precision Strike.

**Revenant** — Shoot his shoulder-cannons off with Precision Strike

**Whiplash** — Freeze with Ice Bomb, then unload

By itself, there is nothing wrong with this mechanic — it’s always fun to kill an enemy in a way that exploits their own nature while ensuring that the starter weapons get their time to shine. After all, the previous game was completely dominated by the SSG, Gauss Cannon, and Chaingun — and I can assure you that all three are just as kickass in this one.

However, there is a problem when you combine this mechanic with the ammo scarcity. These unique kills allow you to conserve ammo — i.e. killing a Cacodemon “the normal way” would take at least three times the ammo equivalent of a Sticky Bomb. And as we already established, you will never have enough ammo in this game.

&gt;**NOTE**: Ironically, the ammo scarcity also makes some weapons a no-go. The Full Auto Shotgun mod is downright hazardous to use until you can get a mastery for it, since your ammo will go WHOOSH in less than ten seconds — and it's the same ammo you use for Sticky Bombs and SSG. The Micromissiles are stuck as a second fiddle to Precision Shot (ironically, in 2016 their positions were reversed). And the Microwave Beam is a sad joke because it takes an ungodly amount of power cells to take down one enemy.

As you go on and meet more and more different demons, Doom starts taking away more and more of your freedom of choice. There is only one way through the encounters — the intended way. You disable all disable-able demons on the battlefield, then you unload at the rest until you run out of ammo, then you chainsaw some schmuck as new demons spawn in, then you repeat. Doing anything differently — like using your Plasma Rifle on a Caco — is heavily discouraged because you have barely enough ammo as is.

All the new tools that you find will integrate into the Dance. You will get Dash, which helps you move faster and dodge attacks — and Dash has a cooldown. You will get a Blood Punch, which lets you properly melee — but you need to charge it with Glory Kills first. The two “superweapons” you find closer to the end of the game use unique ammo and can be used 1-2 times per level. And as your dance becomes more and more complicated, the core game loop of Doom Eternal becomes more and more rigid.

At the end of the day, 99% of the endgame you will be stabbing Cacos’ eyes out while keeping your own eye on the five ammo types and waiting for your five cooldown abilities to recharge. In a way, it is a ballet of bullets. You just don’t get to lead it.

# CONCLUSION

Marty Stratton calls Doom Eternal “a power fantasy”, and in a way, it is. It is a power fantasy of Marty and Hugo, and should you enjoy playing the game their way — Doom Eternal will be your game of the year. Maybe, a game of the decade. And if you don’t… well, you can still enjoy Too Young To Die and Hurt Me Plenty, where the Doom dance is more of a recommendation than a necessity and you can have non-mandatory fun.

Hugo Martin also calls Doom Eternal “a smart game”, and here I disagree. This game shows you how to solve each individual puzzle and then simply asks you to solve them in the correct order. There is very little intelligence involved even on higher skill levels. However, there are a lot of downright brilliant and enjoyable moments in Eternal, and I give praise where praise is due — it’s one hell of a game. I simply prefer the previous DOOM and its gameplay loop slightly more.

Despite all criticism, I had a blast with the game and genuinely enjoyed most of it, to the point where I will be excitedly waiting for the rumored prequel DLC. Aside from the much-needed story expansion, it is also a chance for Hugo and Martin to tweak their combat loop and turn it into something slightly less restrictive. And I can't wait to see what they come up with.",19,1584993925,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fnqv8l/essayreview_how_doom_eternals_brilliant_design/,Games,1

fnmh3z,WrapUpBlanket,"DOOM Eternal plays like a tightly designed character-action game similar to and as good as Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, while (too successfully) masquerading as an FPS.","And if you ask me, that is a good thing, but it does a relatively bad job of telling you this.

I just finished the game on Nightmare, the highest difficulty if you don't count the permadeath variation of that difficulty, and I went through phases with the game, trying to figure it and its systems out. After the Slayer Gate in the Cultist Base took over an hour from my life, I shut off the game for the night and intended to lower the difficulty the next day. When I forgot to do that the next morning I realised that the Slayer Gate taught me some valuable lessons about how this game works, and I kept it at Nightmare throughout. Apart from especially two encounters in the game and the final boss (where I had to learn a new lesson about resource management this late in the game), it was the most fun I've ever had with a singleplayer shooter in over 25 years of gaming. All the other Slayer Gates I finished within 1-3 tries because I 'got it'; I understood what the developers called the 'Fun Zone.'

Thing is, DOOM Eternal's ""Guide to the Fun Zone"" is explained to you in a way that is easy to misinterpret.

The game tries its best to ease you into its systems, but (at least in my experience) it falls a bit short of achieving that. The Anachrotron in particular is a very demanding first big enemy because it's very mobile, has a relatively small weak point hitbox and hits like a truck, and I think that throwing it this early at you is asking a bit too much since you are still likely to figure out the resource management in the game. Add to this the Cacodemon and the explicit instruction to throw a grenade in its mouth and the game, as a whole, gives off the wrong impression of how it is meant to be played. These enemies and their weaknesses make it seem as if though there's always a right tool for the job, and a clear and correct path to deal with each enemy — Enemy A leads to Tool 1 leads to Technique I; Cacodemon leads to Grenade leads to Glory Kill. I had to learn, in playing the game, that that is not true. This Slayer Gate, reminiscent of Challenge Rooms in character-action games, taught me that DOOM Eternal has the same flow as those games, and the very same design principles, and thus should be approached in the same way:

Don't focus on one enemy or one combo/weapon, but switch it up, stay on the move, change priority targets dynamically as the situation changes and learn that it's sometimes better to play inefficiently to survive; that means to leave an enemy half-dead, to let a critical hit opportunity expire, or to waste rockets on fodder enemies (and with it their promise of resources). Sometimes, the best thing you can do is to be inefficient and to switch to a weapon that is too weak to kill (for easy Glory Kills and thus health) or too strong to allow for a Glory Kill to allow you to move on to the next enemy quickly. That is why the game reminds me of DmC or Bayonetta, especially at high difficulties — there is no one combo that you should rely on, because in those games, that will kill your style meter or you.

# In DOOM Eternal, your resources are your 'combo meter,' and breaking it means that you die.

Its biggest issue (and the reason, I believe, why the opinion on this sub is mostly leaning towards negative or disappointment) is that the game hides those mechanical design principles under the veneer of an FPS like (most recently) Dusk. I played DOOM 2016 twice: Once on the PS4 using primarily one or two weapons, and once on the PC using every tool at my disposal. I was fine with the first playthrough, but the second one was leagues better. You could feel that 2016 was designed to be played like the latter option, but allowed for the former, and you can tell that the developers want to push you away from one and towards the other. In my opinion, they are absolutely right to do so, but they also largely failed to show how inherently nuanced and strategic the game is.

The flow of this game is built on your ability to realise, on the spot, which resource you have and which you do not -- by that I mean health, armor, ammo, cooldown charges and, most importantly, time and opportunity. You do not want to Glory Kill every -- or even most -- enemies. You do not want to 'overkill' every or most enemies either. The most successful way to play the game is not to use the most efficient tools at all times, but to sprinkle in just enough inefficiencies to keep the resources flowing. Yes, a grenade will make it easy to Glory Kill a Cacodemon, but it takes time for the enemy to be in that state, and that wait will put you in harm's way. A fully charged Ballista Shot will kill the enemy immediately, but it won't give you much health if any. So what's the solution? It's neither to always use the grenade, nor to always use the Ballista, but to know when to use what. You quickly have to learn that every enemy has weak points and is vulnerable to specific weapons, but if you stick with using the best tool every time you won‘t make it either because resources will run out (yes, a lock-on rocket will instantly kill whiplashes, but you won‘t be able to Glory Kill them if you need the health, for instance, so you better find another combination of damage sources that safely and quickly staggers them in case you need it).

Switching weapons often is the most important thing about the game, by far. The Marauder is the best example for this: very difficult if you stick with any one weapon, but if you bait his green flash, hit him Super Shotgun, quickly switch to the Ballista, quickly switch to the Super Shotgun again etc. you can hit him multiple times per stun, making it a breeze. I also changed my keybinds to something closely resembling the Quake Champions layout (1-4 for Heavy Rifle, Combat Shotgun, Plasma Rifle, Super Shotgun, Q for Rocket Launcher, E for Chaingun, R for Ballista, T for BFG, MB3 for Grenades, Mouse Wheel Up/Down for Equipment Switching, MB4 for Chainsaw, MB5 for Flame Thrower) and that helped so much — being able to quickly change weapons without breaking the flow of the game made everything fall into place. I never used the Weapon Wheel after relying on it up to and in the first Slayer Gates.

I unterstand why people feel like they're being 'forced' to play the game a certain way, and DOOM Eternal is much more tightly designed than 2016 in the sense that it strongly and obviously discourages certain styles of play. But I still believe that it is a major misconception to think that the game can only be played in one certain way; or, as I read in a comment on here, that it is like a brutal version of ""Bop It,"" where every signal requires a specific reaction. The game works — I want to say 'only works,' and I think that's true at least of Nightmare — if you play it improvisationally and if you quickly get rid of the idea that there is only one right tool for the job. Every single one of the numerous tools in DOOM Eternal is the right tool, but it is on you as a player to know how to use them.

I loved it to pieces, I want to replay it again and again, and I want to have an arcade mode like in DOOM 2016 to make the similarities to character action games even more overt. But I hope, in particular, that people find the amazingly crafted joy that this game offers, rather than get turned off by struggling to play a game in a way that is different from how it wants you to play it.",820,1584979632,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fnmh3z/doom_eternal_plays_like_a_tightly_designed/,Games,0

fnlaeq,WrapUpBlanket,"DOOM Eternal is a tightly designed character-action game similar to and as good as Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, while (too successfully) masquerading as an FPS [Minimal Mechanical Spoilers].","And if you ask me, that is a good thing, but it does a relatively bad job of telling you this.

I just finished the game on Nightmare, the highest difficulty if you don't count the permadeath variation of that difficulty, and I went through phases with the game, trying to figure it and its systems out. After the Slayer Gate in the Cultist Base took over an hour from my life, I shut off the game for the night and decided to lower the difficulty. When I forgot to do that the next morning I realised that the Slayer Gate taught me some valuable lessons about how this game works, and I kept it at Nightmare throughout. Apart from especially two encounters in the game and the final boss (where I had to learn a new lesson about resource management this late in the game), it was the most fun I've ever had with a singleplayer shooter in over 25 years of gaming. All the other Slayer Gates I finished within 1-3 tries because I 'got it'; I understood what the developers called the 'Fun Zone.' 

Thing is, DOOM Eternal's ""Guide to the Fun Zone"" is explained to you in a way that is easy to misinterpret.

The game tries its best to ease you into its systems, but (at least in my experience) it falls a bit short of achieving that. The Anachrotron in particular is a very demanding first big enemy because it's very mobile, has a relatively small weak point hitbox and hits like a truck, and I think that throwing it this early at you is asking a bit too much since you are still likely to figure out the resource management in the game. Add to this the Cacodemon and the explicit instruction to throw a grenade in its mouth and the game, as a whole, gives off the wrong impression of how it is meant to be played. These enemies and their weaknesses make it seem as if though there's always a right tool for the job, and a clear and correct path to deal with each enemy — Enemy A leads to Tool 1 leads to Technique I; Cacodemon leads to Grenade leads to Glory Kill. I had to learn, in playing the game, that that is not true. This Slayer Gate, reminiscent of Challenge Rooms in character-action games, taught me that DOOM Eternal has the same flow as those games, and the very same design principles, and thus should be approached in the same way:

Don't focus on one enemy or one combo/weapon, but switch it up, stay on the move, change priority targets dynamically as the situation changes and learn that it's sometimes better to play inefficiently to survive; that means to leave an enemy half-dead, to let a critical hit opportunity expire, or to waste rockets on fodder enemies (and with it their promise of resources).  Sometimes, the best thing you can do is to be inefficient and to switch to a weapon that is too weak to kill (for easy Glory Kills and thus health) or too strong to allow for a Glory Kill to allow you to move on to the next enemy quickly. That is why the game reminds me of DmC or Bayonetta, especially at high difficulties — there is no one combo that you should rely on, because in those games, that will kill your style meter or you.

fnejgr,rborens,Are there are online multiplayer horror games that allow two people to play the story mode with each other at the same time?,"So my friend has finally decided that she wants to brave the horror genre. She lives across the country so we can only play online multiplayer games together. We were gonna get Doom 2016 because apparently that has multiplayer but its only a pvp type thing apparently so I was just gonna watch her play on a share screen type thing. She prefers having us play something together, but I'd prefer to play a multiplayer game where we can both be involved in the story, not just pvp. Are there any pretty scary horror games with online multiplayer that allow multiple people to engage in the story mode?

fnd9lz,Human-Concept,Even watching review of Doom Eternal made me want to puke 😞,"Not a clickbait title. 

I was watching review of Doom Eternal by LGR on YouTube, and after about 5 minutes, I felt like puking. 

I have had this issue with Wolf 3D, early Doom and Quake games too. I have played battlefield for 4-5 hours at a time without feeling anything. But 5 minute game of Quake or Doom just makes me go crazy. 

I have tried increasing FoV in Quake, and it didn't help at all. Plus battlefield 3 on 360 had like 50 degrees of FoV, and it was okay. 

I thought it might have been gore. But Gears 3 worked great for me, so, it was definitely not gore. 

Now, I want to try Doom Eternal because the gameplay is exactly what I like. No fuss, no BS, just a simple gameplay loop that I can enjoy without having to think about it. 

But this problem of feeling like puking has stopped me from playing older versions as well. And I don't know why it is or how to fix it. 

So, if you can think of a possible reason or a solution, please let me know.",1,1584934655,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fnd9lz/even_watching_review_of_doom_eternal_made_me_want/,Games,1

\- Must be free to play

\- Must have private multiplayer so we can play with our group

fn9pw4,KvotheOfCali,Doom Eternal is Mentally Exhausting...and I Love It!,"I think I'm about 50% finished with Doom Eternal. This game is mentally exhausting in a way that no other shooter I've played in the past 20+ years is. 

I played through Doom 2016 again a few months ago on Nightmare and I'm having a significantly harder time with Doom Eternal on Ultra-Violence. The rate of tactical decision making required by the player, given the larger toolkit and more tightly tuned combat encounters, is so much higher that it almost makes Doom 2016 feel like ""baby's first Doom"".  

A lot of games that I love I want to binge and finish as quickly as possible. Not this time. After every level, I feel like I need to go outside to reset my brain for the inevitable firing squad that it's going to face in the next level. 

I'm looking forward to watching speed runs of this game in the future because the skill ceiling is nearly limitless. After every encounter I finish, I find myself scolding myself because I invariably forgot about one of my available tools or weapons lol. 

One reviewer aptly described it as ""trying to keep a dozen plates spinning while an enraged demon is charging right at you"", or something to that effect. 

That's 100% accurate.

there are 17 roles in this game and there are 3 teams one of which includes the neutrals who play for themselves. the other two are mafia and town who try and win by lynching or killing one another

It does test your ability to lie and detect lies too. You never know who is who! People may try and kill you if you are suspicious in the slightest to em

&amp;#x200B;

The roles are as follows

&amp;#x200B;

TOWN:

&amp;#x200B;

**Bodyguard:**

*When you protect someone, you shoot and kill whoever tries to attack who you're protecting, but will die as a result. However, if the Swordsman visits the person you are guarding, he'll block your bullets with his sword and run away into the darkness, your life having been spared.*

*You have 1 self-guard.*

You can choose to protect a target every night. this target will receive no harm, but if attacked, you will kill the attacker and take the damage. This will not work if they are jailed

&amp;#x200B;

**Doctor:**

*You heal people. You have 1 self-heal.*

You can choose to heal one member per night. No matter how many times they are attacked, they will survive. This will not work if they were jailed

&amp;#x200B;

**Escort:**

*You go to people's house and sleep with them, blocking whatever action they may have taken that night. You are immune to being roleblocked.*

You choose your target in the night. Your target will be unable to perform their ability and will get role-blocked. Role-blocking is a powerful ability, if you block the right targets they will inflict no harm to the town

&amp;#x200B;

**Investigator:**

*Investigate people at night*

You can choose up to one member per night. You will receive knowledge if they possess weapons , if they have blood on them or not, if they are tricksters , if they are manipulative beauties and have possible roles of theirs given to you. However, if they are framed, you will receive incorrect info and be tricked into believing they are the mafia/devil

&amp;#x200B;

**Jailer:**

*You choose who to jail at night in the day, protecting them from any attacks that night, and can execute them if you choose to do so.*

The jailer is a very powerful role, beware, exposing yourself can be disastrous as you pose a threat to both mafia and devil

You choose your target in the day, at night they are roleblocked and will be able to communicate with only you. You have the power to let them live or execute them if you feel they are suspicious.

&amp;#x200B;

Immunity will not work

&amp;#x200B;

**Lookout:**

*visits people's houses and see everyone who goes to it.*

A lookout is an important role. You can choose who to look out for in the night. You will be able to see everyone who interacted with them. Through this, you can determine the cause and attacker of their death.

You have 1 self-lookout.

&amp;#x200B;

**Medium:**

*You are able to talk to the dead at night, gathering potential valuable information from them. Upon death, you have 1 seance available. Pick anyone alive during the day to allow them to speak to the dead for that night.*

However useless a medium may seem, They can communicate with the players that died and gather information. Although players usually lie about their knowledge of mafia or make random assumptions and in such cases leading to a false lynch of a town member, or they can share the result of their investigations and profile gather info right before they were killed and were unable to tell to the town. After you die, you may summon a player once to speak with the dead.

A medium's curse means the medium being killed on the first night fulfils the prophecy and the curse is in effect, a myth made by the local players

&amp;#x200B;

**Profiler:**

*You profile whether a person is suspicious or not. Godfather will appear as not suspicious to you*

You can choose to check a player's profile once every night. You will be able to determine if they are suspicious or not and if they are members of the mafia or the devil.  However, if they are framed, you will receive incorrect info and be tricked into believing they are the mafia/devil

&amp;#x200B;

**Veteran:**

*Once on call, you sit in your chair with gun and bible out behind your door, shooting, killing most who knocks. With your bible on the other hand, if the devil comes to visit you, you banish them to hell, killing him.*

A veteran carries a bible and a gun. The player can choose to go on call in the night, which means everyone who visits the player that night will be shot and beaten to death with a bible. However, you will not be able to shoot the swordsman, who will dodge your bullets and elope. If you choose not to go on call on a night you are vulnerable just like any town member.

Vet baiting means convincing players to attack you or visit you

You have 3 on calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vigilante**

*You have the choice to shoot at anyone of your choosing. You have unlimited bullets.*

A town version of mafioso

A vigilante carries a bible and a gun. They can shoot anyone of their choosing. They will not be able to kill the swordsman or anyone immune. They serve the town and can kill anyone they find suspicious.

Do hope you don't run into a bodyguard or a veteran on call, big mistake!

&amp;#x200B;

MAFIA:

&amp;#x200B;

**Framer:**

*You frame someone at night to be suspicious and part of the Mafia. When all Investigators/Profilers are dead, you gain investigative powers. When you're the last Mafia standing, you gain the ability to kill.*

A framer will be able to frame a player once a night. This player, if investigated or profiled, will appear to be the devil or a part of the mafia. If the investigator and profiler both die, they will be able to investigate anyone. If all mafia members are killed, the framer gains powers to shoot anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Godfather:**

*You can kill 1 a night and you are immune at night. If you end up in a tiebreak with a neutral killing, they win.*

A godfather is the leader of the mafia. They can order the mafioso to kill anyone once per night if they want to. If the mafioso dies, they will get the power to kill anyone of their choosing. They are immune, which means no player will be able to kill them. Immunity, if discovered can get other players suspicious of your role. You will appear as 'your target takes charge, they may be the godfather' to the investigator

&amp;#x200B;

**Mafioso:**

*You can kill 1 a night. Godfather can order you to kill a target of his choosing.*

A mafioso carries a gun and can kill a member of their choosing per night. They cannot kill the swordsman or immune players. The godfather can take control over who you kill. It's important to look out for veterans and bodyguards if you have such a role, for your team risks losing with every member lost.

&amp;#x200B;

**Swordsman:**

*You are a master swordsman pledging allegiance to the Mafia. With every slice of your sword, you kill your enemies with ease. You have the ability to block every bullet so the Vigilante, Veteran, and Bodyguard are unable to kill you. You are immune to everything except the devil.*

*NOTE: YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOUR MAFIA MEMBERS ARE. Due to this, you are unable to communicate with them at night. You work alone because you were betrayed before and as a result have secluded yourself completely, even from your allies.*

Swordsman is a powerful role too. You may choose a target to kill during the course of the night. You are immune to most and have the ability to evade players who try and kill you. Only the devil will be able to kill you. Unfortunately, you will not be able to communicate with your team or know who they are even. You have maximum immunity.

&amp;#x200B;

NEUTRAL:

&amp;#x200B;

**Devil:**

*You are alone. You prey on people's fear and you slice at them with your sharp claws in delight. You are immune at night. If you end up in a tiebreak with the Godfather, you win.*

A devil is a solo role. The game cannot end even if all mafia are dead, and the devil remains. You are fully immune at night and can choose to kill any player of your choice. You cannot kill immune players.

&amp;#x200B;

**Executioner:**

*You want the Town to kill the Town assigned to you. If the person assigned dies at night, you will turn into a Jester. You are immune at night as the Executioner.*

*Keep in mind if you win, the game still continues until Mafia or Town wins, if they are still left at the end*

When you play as executioner, you have a player assigned to you to kill. however, you do not have the power to kill. You must convince the town to kill the assigned player by lynching them. If your assigned player dies at night, you turn into jester. You are immune to all attacks during the night. If your target does get lynched, you win the game and you remain executioner, which means your stay immune. The town has no reason to kill you any longer. Remember, they still can lynch you if they want to!

&amp;#x200B;

**Jester:**

*You are a Jester. You are a neutral. Your goal is to get yourself hanged/lynched on the gallows. That very night you are granted the ability to haunt to death anyone alive.*

*Keep in mind if you win, game still continues until Mafia or Town wins, if they are still left at end.*

A jester is a role in which you must try and convince players that you are indeed worth lynching during the day. You must convince players to believe you are guilty, even though you are much insignificant to them. If the town does lynch you, you win the game and gain the power to haunt a player during the night once after youve died. This will kill them even if they are immune. If you die in the night, you lose the game and cannot haunt a player.

&amp;#x200B;

The game takes place as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

A single lobby holds all players

The players are taken to the wheel which determines their role. They will be able to change their appearance names only during this phase. The players are given numbers to be uniquely identified as

Day 1 begins, it is a short duration. Jailer will be able to jail a player

Night 1 begins, players are able to use their powers

Night 1 concludes, The players who died are shown

Players who commit suicide have left the game midway

Their will and deathnote, which is editable during both day and night is read out in tts.

The deathnote is mostly automated and sometimes snitches on players. It is unconfirmed whether the deathnotes are true or not.

Day 1 begins

The players share their knowledge

They probably decide who to lynch taking in account what a player proved

Votes are cast to which player they want to lynch(hang). A certain number of votes (in phase) is required to lynch a player.

If a single player collects enough votes they are sent to the gallows

A time limit is given for them to prove themselves

Players then decide whether they are guilty or innocent

If a player receives Innocent votes in majority, or if there is a tie, the day proceeds

If a player receives Guilty votes in majority, they are lynched and killed. their will, deathnote are read out and they are sent to the graveyard where their role becomes visible to all

A short duration of the day is passed

Another person can be voted to the gallows in this duration

Night 2 begins

Once more players use their powers

Night 2 concludes and so on

This repeats until only mafia or only town is left

If the town kills all mafia, they win and vice versa

neutral roles may win simultaneously

If a few nights are spent with nobody dying, the game ends in a tie.",1,1584905523,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fn5kf3/a_detailed_guide_to_townofidiotsio/,Games,1

fn46uo,Bluestank,Games/Activities to play with the older generation during isolation.,"My parents (in their late 60's early 70's) have never really played any video games before and while they can use a computer, and have smart phones, they are quite technically challenged. 

For the past few years though, we have started getting together for game nights with board games. We generally have to play simple to medium complexity games, as the more complicated games seem to overwhelm them. 

They have already started becoming quite bored and stressed by the isolation, and asked what we could all do together. Does anyone have any recommendations for activities or games that can be played remotely, that don't require them to do things like install Steam or own a game console? I have tried playing Jackbox Party games with them in the past, but I think those kind of moved a little too fast for them.

fn0qds,VickyGayGeek,Conflicted feelings about the DMC franchise (very long post),"***DISCLAIMER: This is a very long post, and I am not forcing you to read or comment if you don't like long posts.***

&amp;#x200B;

 I used to be a big Devil May Cry fan... up until a certain point, probably starting to deteriorate with the DmC reboot. What's strange to me is that when they got back to the old continuity again with Devil May Cry 5, I was completely indifferent to it. And now I'm starting to grow more and more nostalgic for the three first games. Why is that? Well, that's what I would like to talk about.  


Devil May Cry 1 and 3 are generally seen as the two best games of the franchise, the two the others wish to be like. Hell, even Devil May Cry 2 isn't AS bad as people make it out to be. These games had this gritty horror-esque victorian feeling to them, but set in modern days, and having a wise-cracking sarcastic half-demon kicking demon ass without breaking a sweat, all while they play badass rock music in the background sometimes combined with orchestral church-like music.  


This dude, Dante, with white hair and a red cape, big sword, two pistols, and a double-barrel shotgun... with these three games, it was the Golden Age of the Hack 'n' Slash genre (God of War also came out during the time of these three games, which just further proves my point).  


Then with Devil May Cry 4, something was different. Something was off for me. I couldn't put my finger on it back when it was new. In fact, I loved it blindly when it came out. But looking back at it, I fully realize what's off. Of course, there's the obvious thing people already have been complaining about with Nero being the new protagonist of the game even though he's a much more boring and generic character (though, some people like him, which is fine - I just don't)... and not only does it take a long-ass time before you get to play as Dante, but his gameplay is just all about backtracking already played levels and fighting bosses you already had fought. Don't even get me started on other annoying gameplay elements like the board puzzle with the dice mechanic.  


No, there's something else too with Devil May Cry 4. It feels more... fantasy. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE fantasy, but it does it the wrong ways in this game. Unlike games 1-3, it now doesn't feel like it's set in our world anymore. Up until this point, it was OUR modern day world being invaded by demons. But now? There's this weird fantasy place you go to that feels far more distant from reality than ever before. No cars, no electronics, not anything. It almost feels like some weird Final Fantasy game.  


And then the DmC reboot no one wanted. Made by Team Ninja, fucking it all up. Dante looks like a regular dude with black hair and not a red coat, and acts like a bratty angsty hipster emo. And starting with Dante having an orgie with lots of sexy ladies... because Team Ninja. Can you tell these are the same horny pathetic basement-dwellers behind the Dead or Alive franchise? I know, shocking.  


So, doing a smart move, Devil May Cry 5 is made and goes back to the old continuity... but it's still made by Team Ninja. Why? Because Capcom are moronic and don't learn from their fucking mistakes, that's why. And, old Dante is back, but he looks like shit. Facial-wise, he looks NOTHING like Dante. Just looks like a random old bum dressed up like Dante. Why is Dante even getting old? He's a half demon, I thought he was immortal?  


But even worse than that, something NO ONE seems to bring up... DMC 5 is very misogynistic. In the DMC anime along with DMC 4, they set up that Dante was working with Trish AND Lady, and then at the end of DMC 4 made it seem like Nero would perhaps join them. Now, I'd prefer to be allowed to play through the whole game as Dante like in the first three games, but have it be there as an extra option or unlockable option to play through as someone else as well... but fine, they wanna make us play as both Dante and Nero in DMC 5. And apparently a third one.  


So, the third one is Trish, right? Nope. Is it Lady? Heh, nope. It's a new character, called V. And yup, he's a male. Because god forbid we could be allowed to play as a female character, right? It's not like Trish has been there since the first game, or like Lady has been there since the third game. Nah, let the other two playable characters other than Dante be one introduced in the fourth game, and one in this now FIFTH game. Totally not misogynistic at all, totally. WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS?!!  


And just the visual style in general for both the DmC reboot and DMC 5 is just lackluster and kinda shit. Not only does Dante look like crap facial-wise in DMC 5, but Nero just looks pretty much exactly like Dante or Vergil did in the DmC game. Furthermore, DMC 5 just completely lacks iconography with the designs. What do I mean?  


Well, think about it. First DMC game's base enemies were the Marionettes, which are these marionette puppets with a very recognizable distinctive look and style. DMC 2 had more beast-like base enemies with the Msira, like goblins mixed with werewolves or something. DMC 3's base enemies were these grim reaper types called Hell Pride. DMC 4 had these cool ones called Scarecrows as the base enemy, which were these cool creepy humanoid-shaped patched together sacks with bladed weapons. DMC 5 has......... uhm... I don't know? Both this game and the DmC reboot seem to focus on making the enemies look more like demonic bug things I guess. But they are more focused on looking gross and grotesque than to look unique and interesting.  


I don't know, maybe I'm being unfair on anything? I mean, look, I'm sure the gameplay is great in Devil May Cry 5. It was in the DmC reboot and in DMC 4 too. I'm just saying, it feels like it's just past it's glory now. The three first games, even the second game, feels to me like the ones that feel like the real legit thing. People seem to really love and praise the way they take the story in DMC 5, but I am not even sure I could even begin to care. Again, I don't give a shit about Nero, and certainly I don't care about V, and the game's being sexist against women.  


And again, the first three games simply let you play as Dante through the whole experience. Why is that so difficult to maintain? For someone like me who used to be a huge DMC fan, it REALLY is depressing to me I can't get into DMC 5. I mean, if anyone wants to try to make me reconsider things, feel free to. But I just don't feel like that's going to happen. Give me the first three games any day over DMC 5.",4,1584887396,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fn0qds/conflicted_feelings_about_the_dmc_franchise_very/,Games,1

fmzar1,Aquamort,Water Mage in need.,"Hi,

So, as you can guess by my nickname, I love water themes. 

I'm looking for a game, when I can use water spells/abilities. Icy thematics get all the love, yet water/sea/ocean ones are always pushed aside.

Can someone recommend me games for PC, where I get a chance to sustain my watery obsession?

Here are the games I already played:  
\- **Divinity's Original Sin II**: played through multiple times. I love the series, yet there is nothing new for me to do.  
\- **Guild Wars 2**: Elementalist was my first character, already played for over 4 years now. Still playing. As you can guess, I'm sticking to Water skills.  
\- **DC Universe Online**: spent some money once Water Powers came out, but ultimately left the game. Got kinda bored.  
\- **League of Legends**: obviously, Nami main (alsongside other champs, like Morgana. I spent money on watery skins for other champs I can play, like Diana, Vlad, Zoe etc.).  
\- **SMITE**: Poseidon, He Bo, Yemoja main (though Nyx is safer pick for me).  
\- **Warframe**: Hydroid main.  
\- **Gothic 2: Night of the Raven**: spent countless hours spamming Water Fist spell onto enemies. We don't talk about Gothic 3, and further titles, here.   
**- Forsaken World**: Water Elven Bard main. 8 years playing gladly spent.  
\- **Perfect World:** Tideborn Psychic main. Playing for 10 years now.  
\- **WoW**: I know there's Shaman class, that has water tree, but I'm not interested in any ActivBlizz's titles that I cannot shamelessly torrent. AB has lost my respect long time ago, and I don't want to give them even half of a quarter.  
\- **The Legend of Korra**: the game was so short, and when I unlocked Waterbending it was even shorter. Didn't like it much.  


I think that's all I can name right now.",42,1584880663,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fmzar1/water_mage_in_need/,Games,1

fmx7x1,Commander_PonyShep,Watching games about seizing and defending land and resources are making me think about the coronavirus,"You know? Like Clash of Clans, Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege, League of Legends, Pokemon GO, Total War, World of Warcraft with its city raids, the Starcraft series, some bits of Gwent, etc.

And the reason is because, to me, watching armies invade enemy strongholds are glorified metaphors for viruses and bacteria invading the human body, and said human body's immune system building and strengthening itself up as much as it can to defend it against them. Especially right now, with the coronavirus, and how our immune systems were not prepared for defending us against this wholly brand new virus that somehow found a million different ways to mutate and adapt to them.

That doesn't mean they're scaring me like the coronavirus itself, though. I'm still going to watch competitive esports of these games, so long as I quarantine myself and take every last necessary precaution against the coronavirus. Because video games are just meant to be entertainment like any other medium like it, and that whatever metaphors mediums like video games produce are usually, if not all the time, unintentional.

fmqmmd,queensinthesky,Would you recommend AC: Odyssey?," 

Looking for unbiased opinions as most threads I found asking this were on the AC sub and of course there's only praise there. I don't play too many games but I adore God of War, Horizon and Sekiro. Games that have an immersive world/setting and deep combat systems that are challenging and rewarding. I love the idea of the best parts of AC Odyssey I've heard about; giant open world, great landscapes, immersive world design, tonnes of side quests. But the negatives sound real bad; boring combat that's sometimes unintuitive, needlessly bloated amount of things to do that aren't all fun etc. Also I got sick of the generic and boring stories of the couple of post ACII games in the series that I played, so am hesitant to dive into a potentially 60-80 hour game knowing it might be narratively a bore.

The reason I still want to sorta try it is I adore ""gamey"" games rather than simulation-like games like RDR2 (as good as that is) - I found that game had too many simulation elements and felt less like a game often and more like a playable novel or slow moving TV drama, which is awesome, but not for me. AC Odyssey sounds like the antithesis; lots of very ""gamey"" elements without the daunting depth of every aspect of RDR2.",32,1584837707,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fmqmmd/would_you_recommend_ac_odyssey/,Games,1

fmn3bt,SituationCornflakes,I asked Steam for a refund on DOOM Eternal.,"Probably an unpopular opinion but the game just didn’t jive with me at all. I enjoyed DOOM 2016 well enough and work is having me stay home so I figured what the hell and bought it. I know the game is designed to be played a bit differently and ammo is more scarce and the enemy weaklings are meant to be exploited and what not, but I got tired of it quick. I’d run out of ammo with no way to defeat the more difficult demons and die. I get it. The idea is to keep you always using all of your abilities and farming for ammo with chainsaw kills and health with glory kills to keep things interesting but they’re not interesting. Lots of the same glory kills are recycled from DOOM 2016, why? The puzzles just interrupt the pace of the game and the secrets weren’t something I particularly cared to find. I guess it’s just not my game. To say some positive things about it though, the game looks amazing and is optimized fantastically. I never fell below 144hrz 

Maybe you will enjoy it. Like I said I only bought it because I’ll be home so if you’ve been eagerly waiting it you’ll probably like it. I just wanted to provide a less popular prospective.",17,1584826158,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fmn3bt/i_asked_steam_for_a_refund_on_doom_eternal/,Games,1

fmk0in,iamisom,Opinion: DOOM Eternal is an OLED/HDR Game Changer,"I bought an LG C7 last August, and while I love it, I haven't been ""wowed"" by anything until Eternal. With the right HDR settings, Eternal goes from ""oh that looks cool"" to a jaw-dropping, next-gen-caliber showcase.

Lean into the cartoony/Quake vibes with your HDR settings. Go for vibrant colors and a higher whitepoint to create an otherworldly/dark fantasy vibe where the accent colors can pop out. Slight, slight spoiler ahead, but when you reach the big-ass temple doors in the second level, check out the way the green circular lights on the engravings stand out. With OLED's per pixel illuminessence, it creates this amazing sense of depth like you're walking past neon lights in a city.

They could just show you a list of your online friends, offering you the option to either travel or invite, with a separate counter for spending Nook tickets. Common sense right? Instead, he greatly overcomplicates the process by asking you a long list of questions, cut up by pointless dialogue.

\&gt; *What do you want to do?* (a) Fly, (b) Receive visitors

\&gt; *Roger that! I can offer you a Nook Miles Ticket.*

\&gt; *So anyways ... Where do you want to go?* (a) Visit a friend, or (b) use a Nook Miles Ticket.

\&gt; *You want local or online?* (a) Local, or (b) Online

\&gt; *Okay! I'll connect you to the internet.* (a) Roger! or (b) Never mind

\&gt; ... ... ...

\&gt; *Okay! So do you want to go to Bob's island?* (a) Yes!, or (b) No, try someone else.

\&gt; ... ... ...

\&gt; *Okay! How about Craig's island?* (a) Yes!, or (b) No, try someone else.

\&gt; ... ... ...

\&gt; *Okay! How about Dan's island?* (a) Yes!, or (b) No, try someone else.

\&gt; ... ... ...

He proceeds to fucking GUESS which friend you want to visit until he happens to get it right.

What could be a very straightforward and quick process ends up getting drawn out and nested within dialogue options.

\---

This isn't the only place where the UX is strangely implemented.

* Crafting: When you approach a DIY Bench and press ""A"" to craft, the first prompt you get is ""Would you like to craft?"" I mean, of course I do, that's why I pressed ""A"" on a crafting bench? After this, you have to craft each item one by one, with no option for bulk crafting. This means that if I want to make an umbrella, I have to select it from the menu and watch the unskippable 3-second crafting animation, then click ""Continue crafting"". If I want to make \~15 leaf umbrellas to sell them, let me just do that with one click --- why the fuck do I have to manually click through and watch these animations?
* Placing items: there's no silhouette to show you where the item will be placed. Too many times I've placed an item in the wrong spot. Thankfully you can just push it over a tile or two if needed, but I don't see why a simple silhouette or outline couldn't act as an indicator to avoid these small eye-rolling moments. When you first place your tent, you have to select ""Let me imagine what this looks like"" and the game loads a separate screen where it shows you the tent. Why not just have it appear directly in the overworld? It's just baffling.

Another complaint I would have is the tool ring: to select which tool to use, you just press left/right until the game GUESSES which tool you want to use. But then I used Nook Miles to \*buy\* the necessary HUD to make tool selection easier. I'm OK with that personally. If there are future in-game purchases you can make to improve the HUD, that would answer most of my complaints.

\---

I shouldn't be surprised at these design decisions. It's the same team that makes Splatoon, and I have played that game for like \~800 hours. The menus in that game are *intentionally* designed to be annoying to navigate, in order to waste your time and add to the ""experience"". In interviews, Nogami (or some producer) has claimed that these designs are purposefully placed, and that the player doesn't know what's good for them.",784,1584814479,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fmjcvh/the_ux_in_animal_crossing_is_baffling_in_how_it/,Games,1

fmj6ed,WardOfLucifer,"""There's a Casio on a Plastic Beach"" - A story from the Trash Island in New Horizons","It was day three on my island (Technically my second day playing the game, since I started playing New Horizons at midnight on release day waiting for Doom Eternal to get its act together on my PC). I needed to put together the plots for three different houses (by ""request"" of our brave leader Tom Nook) on my island, each of which requires a different set of DIY furniture. Unfortunately, due to a number of admittedly foolish and short-sighted decisions on my part, I didn't have the resources for it all on my island. So, after spending 2000 of my hard-earned Miles, I flew to a new island to mine for ore and stone, and find the fruit and wood and weeds I need.

I land on the island; it's raining. Three in-game days, and this is the first I've ever encountered rain. I walk from the dock to the island, which is littered with lilies and cedar trees. There's a spring (or lake or pond or whatever your want to call it) that feeds a river to the sea. I notice that there are three diving beetles and three pond skaters, the most I've ever seen in one place. There are three hills above the rest, each with a cherry tree. And of course, coconut trees on the shores.

I get to mining the four rocks for ore, my shovel breaking the moment I finish the final rock. I get to walking around the shores, and find a message in a bottle; the message, in childish language, talks about having written the recipe in an old dinosaur book. The included recipe is for a bone doorplate.

I decide to start fishing a little; the Nook Miles+ goal for me today is to catch five fish, after all. I toss my bobber in the spring. A fish shadow nibbles twice before it takes the hook. I pull it in...

A tin can. My character thinks about using it for a succulent.

I cast a second time. The shadow takes it straight away... 

I pull in an old tire this time. Two pieces of trash in a row, that's unusual.

Third cast, another can. Fourth, another tire. I try the ocean for cast number five; a boot.

That's when it occurred to me; there was nothing but trash in the water on and around this island. No fish; just cans, tires, and boots. And the bugs adapted to such a trash-filled environment.

I turn my attention to chopping the wood and harvesting the cherries on the island (catching a wasp in the process). I go back to fishing for the trash, hoping to unlock a clever DIY project...

After catching the tenth piece, my character thinks up the garbage patch wallpaper and flooring. Along with a literal garbage bag. When my inventory filled up with cans, tires, and a boot, I decide to fly back. I go talk to Wilbur through my Doctor's mask to head back, then put my Switch to sleep to take a shower IRL.

I turn on Spotify and put on Gorillaz' Plastic Beach album; as the water runs across my body down the drain, the cheap plastic shampoo bottle seems more oppressive than usual...",2,1584813850,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fmj6ed/theres_a_casio_on_a_plastic_beach_a_story_from/,Games,1

fmgl8r,CambodianBreast_Milk,Discussion on gaming with friends during quarantine.,"With the current situation surrounding Covid-19 and social distancing, my group of friends have been trying to get creative on how we can stay social and have fun. So far its mostly been video chats and virtual happy hours, but I'd love to introduce some gaming into the mix.

The biggest hurdle is that aside from 1 other person, I am the only one really interested in gaming and one of only 2 with access to a PC with a dedicated graphics card (most of my friends with consoles have N64/GC/PS2 etc).  With this in mind I have the following questions for discussion:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are some games that are very easily picked up by ""non-gamers""?
2. What are some games that can be played online with very low system requirements (think slightly outdated Intel integrated graphics)?
3. What are some options that might not even require special hardware, or several copies of a game?
4. And finally just to throw a wrench into the equation, what are some games that even Mac users could play?

My immediate thoughts first thoughts were games like Minecraft, and Stardew Valley as the obvious choices.  Maybe even browser based games like Runescape ? Finally my final idea was to stream games from the Jackbox Party pack series through twitch and have friends join in. What are your thoughts r/games? What games can we use during the pandemic to keep people inside that don't typically game and don't have much access to gaming hardware?

This might read a bit like a game suggestion post, but I think there might be more people than usual finding themselves in a situation where they might be open to gaming to change up their daily routine, but aren't necessarily equipped for it. If inadvertently breaks any rules please let me know, ill be happy to edit this post.",1,1584804240,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fmgl8r/discussion_on_gaming_with_friends_during/,Games,1

fmf9am,jasonj2232,PS5 and Xbox Series X: The Most Innovative Console Generation in Decades? || An Explanation of the Innovative Features of the Next-Gen Consoles.,"Disclaimer: This is a very long post, so if you intend to read through it in its entirety instead of just skimping through some points and proceeding to argue with me in the comments, you might want to grab some fried chicken and popcorn to keep your stomach full while you read through this post. I've divided the post up into sections to make it easier to read but I won't be providing a TL:DR because doing that imo takes away a lot of context and doesn't adequately explain things. I've tried to explain detailed things in simple terms, so analogies won't be perfect but they should give you a general idea and understanding of the things I'm trying to explain. I'm also not claiming to be a technical savant, so if you spot something wrong, don't just yell about how it's wrong and how I should be ashamed to even live on this planet. Explain why I'm wrong so that I don't make the same mistake in the future. Thanks for reading!

# INTRODUCTION

Over the past week I have been poring over every single detail that Sony and Microsoft revealed about their next gen consoles, all the while grinning gleefully because these consoles sound amazing and are packed with innovative features and solutions which I can't wait to see be implemented in games, which is why I find it so annoying and infuriating that the conversation around these consoles is dominated by the number of TERAFLOPSTM (Trademarked by Fanboys worldwide) each console has. 

Don't get me wrong, a console's power is very important, but beyond a certain point it doesn't really matter (for me at least). Both these consoles are powerful enough to run games at 4K60. The Series X is more powerful, yes, but that was the case this generation anyways with the launch of the One X. We'll see that extra power being utilised in games to deliver higher or more stable framerates (Microsoft said that 4K60 is their base target and they want games to be able to run upto 120FPS, kinda like how the One X achieves 4K30 and can run games upto 60FPS) and maybe somewhat prettier or more detailed games but the power gap doesn't seem to be so large that games will run on the Xbox at a higher resolution (like it was the case with some games early in the generation this gen) or significantly higher FPS. I'm not dunking on the Xbox here, Microsoft has done an astounding job and they've delivered upon their promises, but imo a year into next gen, games are pretty much gonna look the same across both platforms, as has been the case in the past.

To me, the power of these consoles, while amazing, is the least exciting thing that was revealed about them. Other features of these consoles are much much more interesting and innovative but due to the somewhat technical nature of these features, everyone seems to be ignoring them.

So in this post I'll be highlighting most of these features, for both consoles, and explaining how these features are going to have an effect on the games we play and what it is that makes these features innovative.

Before we start though, I have to say that I'm very happy about the directions these consoles are going. I think most people, including me, assumed that they're basically going to be extremely similar to each other and to PCs but after the reveals it's quite clear that not only are they quite different from each other in terms of how they achieve the shared target that they have, but they're also different from PCs. This brings us to our first point of discussion:

# PROCESSING POWER AND COOLING

I'm not gonna talk about the processors because they're fairly similar and standard components. What I want to talk about is how they're configured.

The Series X uses a tried and tested design. They set a specific Frequency target for both the CPU and the GPU  and supply the chip with increasing amounts of power till the chip hits those frequencies. However, this power draw is not uniform i.e it is a variable range. In certain game scenarios, more power is required to hit that frequency while in others less power is required (to be noted here: increase in power doesn't correspond to an equal increase in frequency i.e it does not scale linearly. To hit higher frequencies you need to input more and more amounts of power to the point where it becomes a case of diminishing results). Power consumed=Temperature outputted. As such, the temperature outputted by the chip is also a variable range like the amount of power consumed (you can actually see the variance in power consumed in real time by the amount of noise the fan is generating. If its spinning faster and louder it means that more power is being consumed). So the design team and engineering team have to design a cooling system that is sufficient and works well for a range of temperatures/power consumed. The catch here is that they're making a prediction about the amount of power that might be drawn by a game and this prediction might end up not being good enough for certain games i.e the cooling system might not be sufficient enough for certain games which means when this game is being played the console is gonna run hot and loud. The Series X designers have clearly taken note of this because the entire design of the console is based around this. I think its fair to say that the Series X has one of the most unique designs out there, and that is to accommodate the cooling system. How well it'll run remains to be seen but the design team seem very confident and I think we can trust them.

Now onto the PS5. The PS5 eschews years of traditional console design and goes for variable frequencies or boost clocks. However there is a huge misconception among people because of the word 'boost clocks'. To understand further, lets take a look at something that has boost clocks in the traditional sense - a PC processor (GPU or CPU, both will do). A PC processor usually has two clockspeed targets - a base clock (lower frequency) and a boost clock (higher frequency). Variable power will be supplied to the processor so that it consistently hits that base clock (so basically what the Series X is doing). However, if there is thermal headroom (i.e more power can be supplied to the chip without it overheating) the processor will be supplied with more power so that it hits the boost clock. However at this boost clock, the temperatures will start to rise and eventually the processor will have to come back to the base clock to prevent overheating. In this type of configuration, both the power and the frequency are variable.

**The PS5's boost clock is not the same as this**. Lots of people have been talking about how the teraflop number is a sham because the PS5 won't be able to run at this 'boost clock' most of the time. That is simply false and here's why: 

The PS5 has a specific power limit i.e it's power consumption is not variable and is a consistent figure at all times. Thus the temperature that the chip outputs is the same at all times. This allows the designers to design a cooling system around the exact temperature that it outputs. What this means is that the PS5's fan is not gonna spin much faster or much slower depending on the how big or small power consumption is. Its going to spin based on ambient temps, as the thermal output of the processor is already know and they only need to account for the variance in ambient temps (which makes the temperature range that the cooling system has to be designed for much more predictable and exact i.e a one degree rise in ambient temperature can be more accurately accounted for than the rise in power consumption). So all the people who suffer through the obnoxiously loud and hot PS4s and PS4 Pros, rejoice for you have to suffer no longer (that is, if you're getting a PS5)! 

How is Sony achieving this though? Well here is where the variable frequency part comes in. The PS5's processor will be able to see what the games are actually doing i.e what activity is going on in-game, and when those game scenarios occur where power consumption spikes up, it'll downclock. Game developers will be able to tell exactly when it is that this power consumption goes up and as such, be able to account for the reduced frequency then (so in a way, you have the predictability and reliability that comes with setting a specific frequency target, but it also mean that devs will have to work a bit harder to fine tune and optimise things). The crucial thing here is that it doesn't have to downclock by a lot. Remember when I said this a couple of paragraphs above: 

&gt;Increase in power doesn't correspond to an equal increase in frequency i.e it does not scale linearly. To hit higher frequencies you need to input more and more amounts of power to the point where it becomes a case of diminishing results

Well the opposite is happening here. Decrease in Frequency leads to an exponential decrease in Power consumption. So a 2-3% decrease in frequency (that's about 40-70 MHz in the PS5's case) can deliver at least a 10% decrease in power consumption. So what this basically means is that the PS5 is going to be hitting the targeted clockspeed of 2.23 GHz most of the time (unlike a PC processor with boost clocks), when it downclocks it's not going to be by a significant amount (again, unlike a PC processor) and while doing all this it is going to remain cool and quiet. Quite an innovative and novel concept huh? This is why the PS5's variable frequency is unlike that of the boost clocks found on PC and shouldn't be compared.

So the summary for this section:

\- Xbox Series X: Variable power/temps but constant frequency

\- PC: Variable power/temps and variable frequency (unless you overclock it, in which case it'll perform like the Series X processor)

\- PS5: Constant power/temps but variable frequency.

The exciting thing for me and maybe others who are interested in hardware and engineering is that these are three different ways to achieve the same general target. Just goes to show that these companies are putting lots of effort into the design and engineering and not just copying things and definitely not skimping on anything.

Now lets move on to the next and imo the most innovative part of these next generation consoles:

# SOLID STATE DRIVES

This is it folks. This is the game changer. This is what's going to deliver a generational leap. If you're worried that the change from 8th gen to 9th gen consoles is going to be like the change from 7th gen to 8th gen wherein it was a jump in graphics but not really a jump in generations, this should allay your fears. It's disappointing to see people downplay the capability of a SSD to just faster loading times and worry about the size of storage, because the inclusion of a SSD can change the way games are made. But before I talk about how the SSD can change things, I want to talk about the PS5's SSD because it's just insane and because while Microsoft has been mainly pushing the idea of faster loading times and being able to suspend and resume multiple games in quick succession, Sony is pushing the message that this is going to be game changing.

When Xbox revealed their 'velocity architecture' and their SSD solution I was extremely impressed- 2.4GBps of raw IO throughput is cutting edge. Microsoft has also done a lot of work on integrating the SSD into the system. They built a hardware decompressor that allows for 4.8GBps of compressed IO throughput and made changes to the DirectX API and wrote specialized code to ensure that the performance  of the SSD is amazing. I was sure then that Sony is going to have egg on their face, just like I was sure that they're going to embarrass themselves when they claimed that their SSD is faster than any SSD on PC.

But the madlads actually went ahead and did it. The PS5's SSD is easily the most impressive part out of all the other parts of both consoles. In fact I would go as far as to say that its one of the most impressive hardware to be made in the past few years, alongside the likes of AMD's Zen architecture.

Just to show you how impressive the SSD is - No consumer SSD on PC will be able to match or exceed its raw speed (5.5 GBps) for another year or so. No consumer SSD on PC will be able to match its compressed speed (8-9 GBps) until the next revision of PCIE gets adopted by manufactures (which will happen many years from now) or until a CPU manufacturer implements a dedicated hardware decompressor in its processor (which is extremely unlikely to happen). No consumer SSD on PC will be able to match its performance in games because the storage interface that Sony has built for its SSD is better than the NVME spec that is standard on PC.

Now getting back to how such super fast storage is going to change the way games are made. The largest impact that the SSD is going to have is on Game and Level design. Currently, and ever since we stopped using cartridges, games have had to be designed with the speed limit of HDDs (and in the past, discs) in mind. You can actually see these limitations while playing a game - All those super long corridors and long elevator rides, they're there not because the game designer loves corridors and elevators, but because designers are forced to implement them because of the speed limit of HDDs. This is still an abstract explanation, lets see what impact it has on an actual game:

One of the most requested features from fans of the game Horizon Zero Dawn for its sequel is the ability to fly by mounting robots which can fly. However, this simply would not be possible now because the game was designed with the slowness of a HDD in mind. Here's why it wouldn't work - Lets consider Meridian, the large and detailed City that's in the middle of the map and on top of a mesa, with one end being connected to the adjoining hills by long bridges while the other end is connected to the flatlands below by tall elevators. It was surely a creative decision to design a city like that, but it was also a technical one. Because the City is so detailed and large, with a large number of NPCs each with their own dialogue and music, the data for the city cannot exist in system memory at the same time as the data for the rest of the game world. So when you're walking towards the city the game is dumping all the data for the open world and loading the data for the city, but since HDDs are slow, the bridge has to be longer and the elevators have to be taller to ensure that the game has enough time to load the city. They also have to put in place artificial limits - for example Aloy's running speed when she is on the bridge is slower than when she is out in the open world and she cannot ride a mount (the game's controllable robot horses) into the city because it would be too fast (this is also why you cannot ride a horse into Athens in Assassins Creed Odyssey). Similarly, flight cannot be a thing because the game, or rather the HDD, simply cannot keep up with the speed of flight. If you tried to fly into Meridian the game would just get stuck until its all loaded up and that's something no game dev will allow.

Another example is GTA V. Don't you think its odd that while the map is so large and detailed, you cannot enter most buildings and the city itself is not as populated and feels rather empty? GTA V was a 7th gen game so it had limitations like amount of RAM (the PS3 only has 512 Mb which is just fucking crazy) and rendering power in addition to the limitation of the HDD. But with the current gen, those two limitations went away and yet we ended up with a game that's very similar to its last gen counterparts and that's because of the slow HDDs.

The improvements aren't just limited to open world games either. Linear games will also see a big change. Lets take The Order 1886 as an example. It's a game with extremely detailed settings. In fact its graphical fidelity is among the best of the games that were released this gen. However, almost all of it felt like a facade, because it was. For example, in a section of the game you enter a bar/brothel and in it you walk in a long corridor full of doors. However you couldn't enter any of those rooms, you couldn't see what was inside, you couldn't interact with anything. Why? Because the corridor is actually a hidden loading screen, as you're walking across it the games is unloading everything from the last big area of the game and loading everything required for the next big section of the game. It simply cannot load anything else. So if you felt that linear games were just movies that occasionally let you press buttons on your controller, this should change that.

So far we've talked about how the SSD will remove limitations forced upon game devs. Now lets talk about how it'll enable designers to expand their vision and to do that I want to highlight one game in particular - Beyond Good and Evil 2. With BGE2, the creative director, Michel Ancel, wants users to explore a Solar System and on some of these planets of the solar systems there are vast cities, larger than any of the cities Ubisoft has done so far. Ancel wants people to be able to be in space and then seamlessly travel to a city on the face of a planet and explore its depths and then seamlessly travel back to space (i.e he wants all this to happen without loading screens). This type of game simply would not be possible on platforms without SSDs unless the creative vision was seriously compromised with (by either adding loading screens, making things so slow that they space travel doesn't seem like space travel anymore or by significantly reducing the size of the city).

With the PS5's SSD, Sony wants everything to happen in a snap, they want things to be immediate, they want you to be able to ride a flying robot dinosaur into a large city, shoot some unruly robot in the face with an arrow, then mount a horse-like robot and exit the city at breakneck speed towards your next objective, all without artificially stopping you in your tracks, without making you walk across long bridges or wait through a long elevator ride. They want loading times to be 1 second, not 10 seconds. They want you to be able to get back to playing again after dying without having to look at 'tips' for 2 minutes. They want your fast travel subway rides across New York to be over in 1 second, not 3 minutes. It might not seem much to you now, but once you experience that sense of immediacy, of things happening instantly, going back to anything that isn't this, that is slower, is going to be annoying.

So after all this, you can understand why I'm so excited for the SSDs, specifically Sony's solution and why I was using terms and statements that seem hyperbolic at first to describe these SSDs.

Before moving on to the next section, I want to talk a couple more things about the SSD. 

Number one thing is, it's going to reduce game sizes or at the very least, ensure they stay the same. Developers often copy the same thing multiple times across a HDD to ensure that it is there when they need it. Now instead of having 200 postboxes on storage, they only need 1 since it can be accessed in an instant. Also, a vast portion of a game's file size is taken up by uncompressed audio. For example, when No Man's Sky launched, it had a file size of 5GB iirc. Around 4GB of that file size was taken up by audio. With the presence of great hardware decompressors on both platforms, devs can now compress the audio to a much smaller size, thus reducing total file size.

Second, its going to make development of games slightly easier. Devs won't have to spend a lot of time carefully specifying memory usage and fine tuning everything. They wont have to spend time getting the length of a bridge and the characters walking speed across that bridge just right so as to ensure everything loads in time.

Third, games aren't going to get slower after release. You might've noticed that games get 'slower' over time when they've received a lot of updates/patches. This is again because of HDDs. With a SSD, this isn't going to happen.

# IMMERSION AND PRESENCE

This is a PS5 specific thing. A key tenet of Sony's next gen console is 'immersion' and 'presence', the feeling that you are inside the game that you're playing. How are they going to achieve that feeling? Through two things - reactive interaction and immersive sound.

The first, reactive interaction, is a term I just came up with to describe the haptics on the controller. Sony didn't talk about this in their presentation but if you read the Wired interview, you'd know that they're going all in haptics. They don't just want the vibrations that the controller makes to be 'strong' or 'soft', they want it to have 'texture' and 'weight'. In the article the journalist describes a PS5 version of GT Sport with enhanced haptics. He says that while driving a car, he could feel the difference between driving the car on an asphalt surface and driving it on grass. Another example given was a platforming game where one could feel the difference between walking on snow and walking on mud.

The second, immersive sound, seems to be the second biggest feature of the PS5, after the SSD. Now I'm not going to go too in-depth about the PS5's Tempest 3D audio tech, because a) its quite complicated and frankly I don't fully understand some parts about it and it probably deserves a post of its own and b) Cerny again does a better job of explaining that I ever will be able to. What I can say however, is that its the most complicated and advanced sound solution that I know of that has been put into a consumer product.

Over the past week I've actually seen a lot of comments saying how this is basically useless and doesn't work or about how this technology already exists in AMD's GPUs and is called AMD TrueAudio and that the Series X also has this feature through an implementation of Microsoft's Project Acoustics. Both of these notions are false. The PS5's Tempest audio tech does work (in theory) and its much more advanced and different than either TrueAudio or Project Acoustics.

Before I go into why it should work, lets talk about how its different than TrueAudio and Project Acoustics. TrueAudio is basically a dedicated chip to process audio instead of using the CPU or GPU to do so. AFAIK this technology is already used in the PS4 and Xbox One and hasn't really been put to much use in AMD's GPUs or the consoles apart from for VR games. To explain Microsoft's Project Acoustics, we need to take a slight detour into Physics 101. You might be aware that Light has dual-nature i.e it behaves like a particle and also behaves like a wave. The prime difference between particles and waves is that particles travel along straight lines (i.e rays) while waves can 'bend around' objects. While light behaves like a particle and a wave, sound only displays wave nature i.e it is a wave and displays properties of waves. In games however, wave properties of sound like occlusion and reverberation haven't been properly implemented. In games, devs code sound to be like a ray, it originates from one specific source and travels from there like a ray does. They try to simulate wave effects like reverberation but it isn't very accurate. Project Acoustics basically changes that and implements real life wave-like behaviour of sound like occlusion, obstruction and reverberation in game.

Now the tech I mentioned above isn't quite specific to 3D audio but should lead to a general improvement in audio quality. Sony's Tempest audio tech meanwhile, is trying to achieve this and much more, specifically in the department of 3D audio. Now, 3D audio isn't a new idea whatsoever, in fact you've probably already experienced it if you've been in a theatre with Dolby Atmos or own a Atmos certified sound system or if you have a particularly good piece of surround sound equipment. However, Sony's implementation of 3D audio is quite different and more advanced than the consumer implementations we've seen before. To see how it's different, I'm going to compare it to Dolby Atmos:

First off, it is to be noted that the way we perceive sound is unique to all of us (i.e its different for everyone) because of the difference in the shape of each of our heads and ears. AFAIK, Atmos doesn't account for these differences while Sony's tech is trying to, key word here being 'trying'. The obvious caveat here is that since the way each of us perceive sound is unique to us, there is simply no way Sony can program a unique algorithm for each of the millions upon millions of people who are going to be buying a PS5. What Sony is doing instead, is scanning as many people as they can, and building 5 general algorithms based on all the people they scan, and the end user can select the algorithm that suits them the best out of these 5. What this means is that for most people, game sound should be extremely close to how they perceive sound irl, for some people it's going to be exactly how they perceive sound irl while for some people the improvements in audio is not going to be perceivable because they're outliers i.e the way they perceive sound is much much different than the way most people perceive sound. This is just at launch though. Sony has said that it's a multi year project for them, so they'll be building more algorithms as they collect more data from people, this is what Cerny meant by 'send me nudes of your ears'.

The second difference is quite straightforward. Atmos uses 36 individual sources of sound. Sony's tech can use hundreds and thousands of sources of individual sound and the quality of the sound streams themselves can be much higher.

The third difference is that use of Atmos requires specialised, certified hardware that matches Dolby's spec. Sony's audio tech doesn't require certified hardware and it will work with any set of headphones, TV speakers or surround sound systems. Not everything will be supported at launch though. All headphones will be supported and Cerny says that headphones will be the gold standard. Currently they're working on implementing support for TV speakers and in the future they'll implement support for multi speaker surround sound systems.

So all this is quite exciting stuff then. There is however an issue. While the SSDs will have an objective improvement in games, the sound technology and controller are going to be much more subjective and the improvements they will offer isn't exactly clear. For example, you might not like the haptics at all and completely disable it or you might be one of the outliers in terms of how you perceive sound and hence you won't be able to tell much of a difference. As for me, my opinion on the PS5's audios system is gonna depend entirely on whether or not it comes with a 100 hour long Mark Cerny read the LOTR Trilogy ASMR audio file.

So until we see, or rather experience games built for the PS5, it's impossible to tell if all this will have much of an effect. Regardless, the concept alone is quite innovative and exciting and I have to give Sony props for following through with this despite the complexity of it all.

# ENHANCED CONTINUITY

This is a Series X feature, at least for now. What I mean by enhanced continuity is basically enhanced backwards compatibility. The backward compatibility features of the Series X, courtesy of the amazing Xbox Backwards Compatibility team at Microsoft, is easily the most impressive part of the Series X for me (again, the power of the Series X is jaw dropping, but beyond a certain point it doesn't really do much for me. Meanwhile, the PS5's SSD kinda overshadows the still impressive Velocity Architecture of the Series X).

Sony talked about 'machine learning' in one of their Wired interviews but it was just a vague term and so far we've not seen anything about the machine learning capabilities of the PS5 or even if it is actually present on the PS5. Meanwhile Xbox has actually showed off an impressive use of machine learning. The fact that the Series X can play thousands of Xbox One, 360 and OG Xbox titles is amazing but its ability to automatically play the game at higher resolutions and framerates and even apply HDR to it is just downright jaw-dropping. Of course the caveat is that not every previous-gen Xbox game is going to work but because the backwards compatibility team has been working on this for the past 4-5 years. we can play thousands of previous generation games at launch on the Xbox and that's just frickin awesome.

The PS5's backwards compatibility situation was kinda blown out of proportion with many people assuming that it isn't backwards compatible at all or that only 100 titles were going to be backwards compatible (which just goes to show you how little people were paying attention during the whole event) when in fact Sony is just doing what Xbox has been doing for the past 5 years - testing, certifying and improving games on a title to title basis. What is disappointing though is that it took them so long to finally start doing this and now they're just so far behind Microsoft with regard to backwards compatibility.

This idea of enhanced continuity also extends to the peripherals. All Xbox One peripherals will be compatible with the Series X, that's all well and good, but they'll also receive a software update that brings with it the Latency Reduction features that Microsoft has baked into the Series X controller and that is awesome.

# SERIES X SPECIFIC FEATURES

There are a couple of more features that Microsoft announced that while innovative, I can't really talk much about because there isn't much to talk about it. So I'll just list them out.

Another thing to note is that these are Series X specific features for now. The fact is that unlike major components like the SSD, Processor or the Audio chip, these features already exist in the base AMD processors that both Sony and Microsoft are using or can be implemented via software updates. So far  only Microsoft has talked about these features so I'm gonna assume that only the Series X has these features unless Sony says otherwise. So here's the list of features:

* Minimising Input Lag
* Variable Refresh Rate
* Elimination of screen tearing
* Variable Rate Shading
* Smart Delivery

# CONCLUSION

So there you have it, I've highlighted why I believe that this generation of consoles might be the most innovative in decades. Now I understand that this is a very big statement to make. 

Some of you might argue that back when consoles used specialised, purpose built hardware like the PS3's Cell Processor, consoles were more innovative, but to that I respond by asking, how does it matter if those consoles were packed with innovation when developing games for them was so hard that you couldn't even make full use of many of those innovations?

Others might also say that just like it has been in the past, no developer will actually make use of these features and I understand why people might be so skeptical. In the past console manufacturers have promised a lot of things but have almost always ended up under-delivering. However, I believe this generation will be different. For one, both manufacturers are listening to the developers and implementing features that developers are asking for rather than creating their own features and forcing developers to use it. Case in point being the SSD. Devs seem more excited about the SSD, specifically Sony's SSD, than any of the other improvements and features and according to Cerny the number 1 requested feature was the inclusion of a SSD. One of the top priorities for the consoles manufacturers is also to ensure that developers have an extremely easy time developing games for the system and that they get to grips with the system as soon as possible.

Secondly, there seems to be a no BS talk being said by both Microsoft and Sony. Cerny outlined his vision for the system and explained with detailed reasons why they made the technical choices that they made while Xbox has been extremely upfront about their vision, aims and achievements with the Series X. There is just a lot more 'real' and honest communication coming from both manufacturers (at least until now, it could all change as we near launch period). During the pre-launch period of the current gen consoles we kept hearing about the cloud or TV or other completely unrelated and BS stuff, so it's nice and refreshing to have Sony and Microsoft just focus on what matters - the games.

I'm also very happy to see that these consoles are different from each other, each with their own unique features. I really cannot wait to see the games that are being built for these consoles and I cannot wait to get my hands on them when they launch.",219,1584798671,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fmf9am/ps5_and_xbox_series_x_the_most_innovative_console/,Games,1

fmemsk,ArcadiaStudios,Why do we gloss over technical issues?,"I am not a seasoned gamer, having been playing modern videogames as a casual hobbyist for only the last 8 years or so. (I’ll include a list of the games I’ve completed below, just to give folks some context for where I’m coming from.) And I’m probably showing my inexperience in my comments below, noting things that the rest of you have just learned to take in stride.

But: I’m nearing the end of “Assassin’s Creed: Origins” now. And while I love the Egypt setting, the main characters, and some of the graphic detail, I’m surprised by the number of what I would call “technical issues” in the game—a game that came out in 2017, I believe, and has had more than enough time to get patched to near-perfection.

First, shockingly long, black loading/saving screens. They occur between major sections (which makes sense) but also between *parts* of cutscenes that end up playing out like a series of disjointed story fragments instead of actual scenes. (Is this just how Ubisoft games are made? I’ve never experienced anything like this in any other game I’ve played.)

Wonky NPC AI. On escort missions, they run, they stop, they walk, they backtrack, they bump into me. On the street, if you walk or ride within three feet of them, they jump back and shout as if you’d stepped on their feet. Shut up, already. (I’ve also encountered a few situations where companion NPCs get stuck in one place and just keep pedaling their feet.)

Frequent graphic pop-in. Despite all of these “loading” screens, it is common to see graphic pop-in occurring throughout the game. Not game breaking, of course, but still distracting.

I don’t know what the technical term for this is (“tear”?), but it is common to see characters walk through other characters, flora, and the dead bodies of enemies and animals. 

Despite all of that, I *am* enjoying playing the game. I just don’t understand how all of these issues appear in what is considered a triple-A game. And why few if any of the reviews I’ve read even mention them. That suggests these things are so common as to not warrant comment...but these are *not* things I’ve experienced at all—or to this degree—in the other games I’ve played, which include:

World of Warcraft, with it's years of content updates and expansions seems to be the best idea I have come up with, if anyone can recommend any games that fit my criteria I would be extremely grateful.

**krazhier**: Having something that decides 1 frame of delay at the beginning of the match means that, halfway through the match, you can all of a sudden be playing at a higher latency and the delay won’t adjust. Then you’d end up with significantly more rollbacks, and changing the input latency on the fly is what we’re trying to avoid from delay-based approaches. I also think it’s not entirely clear whether playing 10% of your matches at 2 frames of delay, but 90% of your matches at 3f of delay, is even that valuable. I think consistency across all games is possibly more important.

\---

I heavily heavily disagree with this sentiment, and I think a lot of high level players will as well. Currently, most fighting games offer you a choice. You can filter out people based on connections, and most serious players refuse to play below 4-5 bars on games like SF5, Tekken, etc.

I don't see why they can't simply offer a similar feature where players can filter out anyone who put the connection above 1-2f of delay.

Forcing everyone on to a 3f delay means that netplay with people on the same coast will actually be worse relative to what it is now. Not to mention, the game is ""significantly"" different with that much added input lag. Imagine trying to be a CS:GO pro and playing with 3f of delay.

I play a lot of games with rollback netcode, and even up to 100ms, you're fine at around 1f of delay. Even 2f of delay is fine up to around 150ms. 3f is for connections approaching the 200ms mark, which seems very excessive to me.

Here's a game I played from Toronto to California with a friend at 100+ms, while he was streaming on 30th Anniversary Collection to illustrate (a game with rollback netcode):

[https://youtu.be/OQXZwWxAyK4?t=164](https://youtu.be/OQXZwWxAyK4?t=164)

By making it 3 f, it's like you're forcing everyone on to the same playing field, but it's a playing field based on the absolute worst of the worst connections that any sane player would filter out to begin with.

I thought the whole point of rollback was to minimize delay for the usual 30-120ms connections, rather than raising the base delay to compensate for people who are around 150+ms like the devs mention.",31,1584776701,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fmbh9p/amidst_all_the_hype_around_gg_strive_adopting/,Games,1

After letting my sister in on the limitations she said something along the lines of “then what’s the point of me even playing?” And I totally agree. For being a ‘family console’ there sure isn’t much in the way of family cooperation. Is there any chance Nintendo will change these limitations?

flz9ob,Team_Puh,AMA: We are Team Puh – the creators of the dark fantasy RPG Bombing Quest," Hi r/Games,   
We are Team Puh – an Indie game dev couple who released our first game Bombing Quest in Early Access on Steam on March 4th.   
Bombing Quest is a dark fantasy bomberman RPG, where the ancient machines of a civilization long gone, awaken you (a ginger bearded dwarf) as the last protector of a mysterious ark. Our Steam Page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1018860/Bombing\_Quest/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1018860/Bombing_Quest/)   
Our Website:  
 [http://team-puh.com/](http://team-puh.com/) 

It is the two of us: Ivo who’s programmer and game designer and Anna: level designer and artist.  We are here to tell you our story: How we decided to get into game development. How the project became and evolved. What are the difficulties of living as an indie dev couple on a strict budget.  It's a story about the love and support from the fans that kept us inspired and the challenges of marketing a game with almost no budget. We will explain where the game currently is, how we plan to make it better and what are our future ideas and projects.

flx7lj,FusionNinja,Unpopular Opinion - Torment: Tides of Numenera &gt; Planescape: Torment,"This will not be an exhaustive, research-driven, deep-dive thesis with bullet-pointed comparison metrics between the two titles. That's already been done before (and much better than I could/would anyhow). I'm simply ""shooting from the hip"" and stating the context of my subjective experience.

When I began playing Torment: Tides of Numenera in mid-2017, I was just properly discovering traditional CRPGs for myself. Sure, I'd played the Big Bethesda Games (Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, FO 3 &amp; 4, Obsidian's New Vegas), and all of BioWare's recent material (Mass Effect 1 - 3, Dragon Age 1 - 3), but as fans of CRPGs know - and as I soon discovered - there's really no comparison to the depth in character development, skill &amp; stat customization, dialogue and pure choice/consequence provided by a really great CRPG. Tides of Numenera was my first foray into this style. It was a complete revelation. I was hopelessly hooked, doing two full playthroughs in a year's time. It was like reading the best sci-fi novel wrapped up in the best table-top game I'd ever experienced. The writing, setting, characters, mechanics, player agency, and aesthetic were just gorgeous IMHO. 

Over the next two years I dug into, to varying degrees: Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity 1, and Divinity Original Sin 1 &amp; 2. After a mind-blowing playthrough of Disco Elysium, I turned to Planescape: Torment Enhanced Edition, which I've put \~5 hours into as of this writing. Frankly, I feel very ""meh"" and indifferent toward it. I don't know if it's unrealistic hype I generated for myself based on its sterling reputation? The crisp visual, UI, and quality-of-life features present in more modern CRPGs that are (understandably) lacking in this 20 year-old game? The fact that Tides of Numenera's tone, presentation and setting immediately swept me off my feet, while Planescape's felt flat in comparison? I suspects it's all of the above to varying degrees.

Bottom line, I think I'm going to take a break from PS:T and give it another shot down the road. Are there any others that agree with my sentiment that T:ToN &gt; PS:T?

flwxqt,plsnotjames,A Humble Request on Game Size,"I feel like in the modern age, every game is needlessly large. I understand that some people have 4k monitors and actually want that, but I don't and now 15 year old games are remastered from 6GB into 60GB. I obviously think 4k should be possible, but is there any way it could be an option just to cut down on size? I have 1.5TB of storage on my desktop and currently 900GB of games. I only have like 10% of my steam library installed.

I also am aware that the size of games will obviously increase over time, but it seems like regard for storage capacity has just become a thing of the past.",6,1584718311,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/flwxqt/a_humble_request_on_game_size/,Games,1
flwuoo,tyontekija,Nintendo should be the one to announce the PS5 and XBOX SERIES X prices,"If you are following next gen news you know that there is currently a stalemate between Sony and Microsoft on who announces their console prices first . Basicly, whoever announces the price first is at a disadvantage because it gives the oportunity to the other company to announce a revised lower price, and revising your price after an announcement would look underhanded and create market confusion.

So how do you solve this? Idealy you make the companies anounce their prices simultaneously with a neutral tird party, but its hard to find a company that wouldn't take a few million to secretly give the advantage to either Sony or Microsoft. Except Nintendo.

Nintendo has the incentive to make both competitors make important financial decisions in the dark, havin both take big losses in console sales, aswell as taking a litle of their spotligh while doing so.

It would work simply by each company sending their console prices to Nintendo with an encripted  email to Doug Bowser, aswell with day 1 bundle prices with PsVR/Kinnect/games and then Doug announces it simultaneously at a Nintendo Direct, followed by Sony's and Microsoft's own show explaining things more detailedly. This could very well make both consoles start at their lowest possible price point and make competition more fair for both consoles.",6,1584718009,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/flwuoo/nintendo_should_be_the_one_to_announce_the_ps5/,Games,1

fluyqu,Bayakoo,Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Users reporting limited experiences with multiple profiles in the same Nintendo Switch,"Some examples:


https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/flu2l4/unexpected_consequences_of_sharing_an_island_on/

https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/flt47x/can_we_talk_about_animal_crossings_profile_2/

https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fln86g/can_more_than_one_person_build_things_on_the_same/

Nintendo Switch has been considered a Family Home console for the past few years but it seems that with Animal Crossing Nintendo is pushing hard for one console per person.

Based on some reports, the second player to start Animal Crossing on the same Switch will have some limits. Such as not being able to place buildings/bridges. Not getting tools as easily. Progress gated by what the 1st player has done. 
If the 1st player starts the game and then don't plays for a while the 2nd player may be stuck with the same tools/buildings.

Me and my GF never played Animal Crossing but this means that one of us won't have the full experience that the marketing and reviews sold us.

Nintendo introduced one island per console to restrict cheating they say but at the cost of gimping the experience of household players. With Mario Maker they also only added multiplayer with friends after multiple complaints.

Previous Animal Crossings were like this but the last 2 big iterations were on DS which are more often used as personal devices compared to Nintendo Switch.",1332,1584710677,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fluyqu/animal_crossing_new_horizons_users_reporting/,Games,1

flsccl,RiKSh4w,GTA5:Online in 2020,"This game is still kicking and I'm tempted by it. But I have a number of worries about trying to jump into it. This is mostly caused by the fact that I'm not really interested in the story mode and my exposure to the game is based on watching youtubers play the game.

1. How is the grind? This is something that youtubers never show. They either skip it because it's boring or they buy their way through the game. Neither of which I can do. So while the game may look fun for them, is that fun gated behind a whole lot of grinding that I'd need to do?

1. Does the game perform badly? This IS something that youtubers lament about. The long load times and sketchy server connection in particular. But again, whenever it gets bad they would snip the recording and be back in the thick of it in seconds; not something you can do in reality.
1. Is there a big gap presented to new players? Youtubers tend to play on their own private servers were there is no random people around to disrupt them. But would I find my play sessions impeded by people in high level tanks griefing in any way they can? I think the game has a passive mode but I'm unsure how that works and even without killing me the experience would be dampened. This question would be more relevant in other games where experience directly related to how powerful your character is but the question remains, would I stand a chance? Would I need to?
1. I've heard rumours of rampant hacking but perhaps that is a case of the squeaky wheel getting the grease. They exist in a lot of games but how often do you actually find them?
1. How necessary is it to have friends to play the game? I feel I'm unlikely to actually be able to pull any friends in which means it'd be up to me to *shudder* make some new ones. I did a quick google for discord servers in OCE but couldn't find any. Is there a working pick up group system somewhere?

flqqka,contrabardus,Doom Eternal is not what I was expecting. No Spoilers. First impression.,"People wanting ""more of Doom 2016"" are going to be disappointed.

It's still Doom, but is more campy than the previous game.

In a weird way, it's more like classic Doom in this regard.

However, so far, for every step forward, it takes a step back, but the steps back are smaller.

For starters, it's far more colorful and saturated. The environments are extremely detailed and interesting. There are some very cool visuals.

There  are also a lot more invisible walls. In an that looked like a destroyed shopping center, I couldn't jump behind a counter because of an invisible wall. I also fell a few times looking for secrets by trying  to jump to a ledge where it looked like I could land, only to hit an invisible wall and fall.

Falling doesn't outright kill you anymore. You just spawn back on the ground minus a bit of health.

The  soundtrack isn't as good this time so far. It's not bad though. It's industrial metal again, but I'm finding it less interesting. It just doesn't have the same kick to it as the last game.

It's also a lot more cartoonish than Doom 2016. Enemies look less ""real"". They seem to have a little of that ""rubbery"" effect animation has sometimes.

The environments are really nice, but also seem less grounded somehow.

The enemies animate really well, the kills are inventive so far, and it's definitely entertaining.

Ammo,  armor, health, and powerups pickups are also a lot more cartoonish. They glow neon colors, more so than in Doom 2016. They are larger and look a bit  out of place to be honest. They are easy to see though, which isn't a  bad thing.

There are also secrets, but rather than being objects placed in the world like the little Funpop Doom guys from Doom 2016, they are large question marks.

The first keycard I found was just floating in the air in an empty  room. In Doom 2016 you found them on bodies and they were naturally  placed in the environment. They seem to care less about that this time.

There's also a 1-up powerup that kicks in when you die. It resurrects you and slows down time for a brief period. It's a large green Doom Guy helmet that says 1-up.

Gameplay is fast, and you're dropped right into things. I have no idea what is going on aside from ""Hell on Earth"". It does not pick up where Doom 2016 left off, unless there's some backtracking in the story later.

I'm thinking there may be some explanation for it, but I'm not sure if it's going to be in codex entries or be a plot point in the actual game.

It also seems harder.

You have a lot less ammo, need to be more accurate, and can't just glory kill unarmed zombies anymore. They aren't just walking health and armor packs anymore. They take a lot more damage and need to be shot first.  

You need to be accurate with your shots, at least in the first area. I'm thinking the game will allow you to upgrade your ammo at some point, but you start out with only 16 shotgun shells.

I've encountered fairly large groups of enemies in the first area, a lot more than in Doom 2016's early areas, but not as many as in some of the later areas.

You'll encounter some fairly bullet spongey enemies early on as well.

Traversal seems to be a bigger focus this time, with bars that swing you around, and I've encountered a fair number of jump pads. Stuff seems less naturally placed though.

It's still a blast to play, but may not be what people are expecting it to be.

A  lot of people are going to hate this game, but I've enjoyed it so far.  I'm unsure if I'll come out of it thinking it is as good as Doom 2016  though.

I'll definitely be  finishing it at least. It's fun and new Doom. Though, again, it seems to  be more of a throwback to classic Doom in some ways, and not always in  ways that improve on Doom 2016.",1848,1584688479,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/flqqka/doom_eternal_is_not_what_i_was_expecting_no/,Games,1

Especially when I found out almost all the security guards are teacher, normal person who have their own life, family to care. It's make me don't want to kill anyone in this game, so in first 2 hours of gameplay I only using Thunderball and Taser. Feel very fresh and clean, because Marcus is just a normal person, he's not a cold blood killer like other game. 

But then I notice, beside of choking people with the rope of Thunderball weapon to make people unconscious, hitting them with a billiard ball is another story. First is when you hit somebody with a thunderball, blood, a lot of blood came out, it's seems like that billiard ball can make a hole on their skull. The second is that everybody who got hit by Thunderball, they doesn't have a zzz icon like taser gun. 

So is it actually a non-lethal weapon? A thunderball.",2,1584686999,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/flqg1z/does_a_thunderball_in_watchdogs_2_is_actually_a/,Games,1

Like a movie set, it's got camera-facing walls with emptiness behind them.

Games I'm thinking of, that I'd like to play more of would include:

- Dwarf Fortress (The best at this I've ever seen)
- Rimworld (I'm yet to play it, but seems to be good)
- Kenshi (I love this game but even it is starting to feel dead after a while)

I want a game that feels as if you, as the player, are just dropped into an already living/breathing world, and that it would continue to live even without you there.

The story goes like this:

In the beginning, there were only four things: Light, Dark, She, and HIM. When these 4 beings were in harmony, life would flourish. BUT. When the beings were unbalanced: War, Pestilence, Death, and Famine would break out across the dimensions. And everything was going great, UNTIL, HE, The embodiment of Strength and Power, Strayed from the Light and chose the DARK. Now it's up to HER, The embodiment of Love, Kindness, and Knowledge, to defeat HIM and restore peace!

flatca,InternetDave,"March 19th-March 22nd, The Largest Prize Pool Age Of Empires 2 Tournament since 2002: Hidden Cup 3.","Hidden Cup 3 boasts the largest prize pool for an Age of Empires 2 eSports event, starting at $50,000. The catch: all player names are hidden until the end of the event and replaced with common hero names from Age of Empires custom scenarios. For long time AoE fans, it's a chance to guess who is who based on play style. For new viewers, it's a chance to see the highest level of AoE without the focus on player history because the casters don't know who is who.

The stream has begun over at [T90Official on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/t90official). This tournament has the direct backing of Microsoft as well, so it's a huge boost to the competitive scene of a 20 year old game. 

The tournament is being played on the recently released Age Of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, which introduced a number of quality of life fixes and modern updates to the game. It also introduced 4 new Civilizations: Lithuanians, Bulgarians, Cumans, and Tatars. Some of this content is only a few months old for players who have years of experience in this environment, which adds even more interest from the AoE community.

But I was wondering, is there any platform that would support games in such environment? It could be anything from quizzes to board games to mario party-type games that people can drop in/drop out (preferably through their browser) and we'd be able to communicate via microphones or webcam.

I run a division of a small software company that now finds ourselves all working from home. I'm worried about my team. Anxiety is running high from a combination of understandable factors. I'd love to find a way to occasionally surprise them and bring us together over a light online game, putting aside concerns about work, COVID-19 fears, being forced to stay home, etc.

Can anyone recommend a site where I can find some FREE lightweight games that I can invite 4-6 folks to join? I'm neither looking for games with dozens of simultaneous players, nor for 1-on-1 chess or anything. Something like Scrabble, card games, 4-player arcade-style games, or even quick 1-on-1 contests that others could watch and jump into next in a round-robin format. 

I have no idea if anything like what I'm describing exists. I'm not much of a gamer and I'm really hoping for things we can play in 30 mins or less. Thanks for entertaining my question.

fks5in,TheDaileyGamer,Battlefield Hardline is one of the best games in the franchise and deserves another chance! Hear me out.,"Battlefield Hardline is one of my favorite Battlefield games, tho I got distracted by other games I still managed to get to level 90 before leaving to something else (Witcher 3) and I had a blast on it, which was crazy for me as my friend no longer had internet and so I was riding solo at the time. But it just pulled me in, it was everything I could want in a BF game (minus a few things). And I fully believe it deserves another chance, whether that just be us playing it again, or a sequel done maybe by someone like Respawn.

Now I feel Hardline has so many things that are great about it that I feel people should take into consideration and if you'll allow me, I'd like to list them:

* It was a fresh new take on the series while still remaining modern, it gave both modern era fans and the fans who wanted something different both something to enjoy.
* It introduced some level of humor that increased many peoples enjoyment of the game
* The easter eggs and overall feel to the game was a lot more enjoyable (though variety made it a bit boring **at launch**)
* The money system added a fun, theme-oriented mechanic, that was enjoyable and added an extra level to point streaks
* The gadgets are wide a diverse from trip mines, zip lines, grappling hooks, gas masks and decoys (and that's just the professional, ((recon)), class)
* Teams both had their own exclusive starting guns and overall uniform feel to them that made it clear which side you were on
* It has some of the best net code and smoothest controls (I just hopped on earlier and it felt almost like it was more responsive than anything that's come out since)
* The campaign was an actual singular story that had an entertaining plot and characters developed by none other than Visceral (RIP)
* The maps were stunning and beautiful and only got better with the dlcs
* The base game is a smaller install at only 48.9GB on Xbox with the 4 DLC being around 5 GB each
* The game had premium pass which has proven to be a much more reliable source of getting quality DLC content on time and without issue
* The game didn't have many issues at launch beyond a lack of gun variety (which ultimately resulted in the initial drop of players)
* The DLCs were full of content, we had the gun bench, plenty of new guns, and gorgeous maps all on time
* It had the spray feature
* Nowadays, you can get it and the DLCs for around $9-$15, this game deserves another chance and the only thing stopping it from getting another chance is us not playing it. It's there, it just needs players again.

And personally I feel if Battlefront 2 can turn it around, then surely Harline still can. Just give it a shot, or another if you were around originally.",6,1584548267,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fks5in/battlefield_hardline_is_one_of_the_best_games_in/,Games,0

fkq494,aegroti,Free Browser based or very low requirement party style games?,"So with clubs and societies cancelling events due to Corona I'm trying to organise games we can still do online together. A lot of the people I'll be with don't have very good computers so they couldn't be running more than basic games unfortunately.

I'd also be looking for stuff that's free to see if it's something that people might enjoy first before they start spending money.

So games I'm already thinking of are such as: ""town of salem"" and skrible.io but are there any good recommendations people can make? (potentially Jackbox but depends on if we can share a screen)

Just a sort of browser game where people can play together that's fairly straightforward and can pick up and play (so not something like Runescape). (also mobile games can also be recommended as long as they aren't specifically apple or android only)

Whether or not a player wins will just be down to their gamble and whether or not the ball land where they predict. This is what makes the game so easy in many ways and as opposite to games like poker or even [**online slot site**](https://www.divineslots.com/), what happen the spin before does not involve the next one. The game is play on a spin by spin base and the player can make a decision to change their gamble each time, keep the same or certainly walk away from the table.

Thanks to the random yet limited nature of the roulette wheel and its outcomes, many huge minds across betting and probability in mathematics have invited method and strategy for the roulette wheel.

fkmgpd,llamacub,The Division 2 vs/or Destiny 2?,"Hello everyone.

I am fortunate enough to own both of these games. However, I haven't played either for quite a long time. I haven't touched the Warlords of New York, or the Shadowkeep expansions.

I tried looking around, but couldn't really find any unbiased or fair discussions on which of these games are ""objectively better"". On the subreddits you usually see mostly negative comments or a frustrated player base. That's my experience at least. (I actually tried Division 2 yesterday, and had a lot of issues with the game crashing)

I've played both games, and enjoyed both immensely, but would like to pick one and stick to it for a while. 

Which of these two games would you pick to play, if you could only pick one? Feel free to expand on why, if you want :)

Thank you very much!",23,1584521419,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fkmgpd/the_division_2_vsor_destiny_2/,Games,1

fklhw7,Som_Luzur,Are there any good games where an AI generates battles with ships/armies/etc that you customize yourself?,"Seven years ago, there was a Windows Phone-exclusive game called Galactic Reign. My father, brother, and I loved playing it because there were two game modes, Normal Mode, where you had to take over planets that gave you resources to build starships to fight a human opponent and Scenario Mode, where you had limited funds to create an army to defeat the opposing, pre-built army. There were three factions, the Alkari, the Sundogs, and the Zorn, who each had different stats and abilities to add to their ships. You had to determine what was best to fight with. You could add the Heavy-hitting dreadnaughts which could pick off your opponents easily one-on-one, or you could have a fleet of smaller ships to swarm them. It was all a matter of balance and budget. When you engaged in battle, the data was sent to their servers and a battle was generated and sent back to the players to watch. The battles were always so epic, especially for a mobile game. As an example: https://youtu.be/brlDBA4RQjA

Unfortunately, this game only lasted a few months. Whether it was because it had a small fanbase because no one had Windows phones or because it was just a proof of concept, (I'm thinking the former, as I haven't seen anything close to it) it was just a shame to see it shut down. So, I just want to know if there are any games out there that even come close to rivaling it.

Thanks,

Next week is my birthday and I was going to have a party to celebrate but with the development of COVID19, it looks like we'll all be in self-isolation before then. 

So I was thinking of hosting an online party - except, I have no idea how to go about it. I thought online gaming could be good. But I am after a game that is accessible to all (ie. available for mac/PC/mobile) and involves a lot of socializing. Kind of like a board-game but just not in-person.

fkjs9a,BadBrent,"Why are some Nintendo Switch games so much more expensive than MSRP, and why are there never any in stock?","I never remember running into this problem with your run-of-the-mill video game but I definitely do understand market-share and how much impact it can have on the availability of a particular game and the norm that the more people that want a game, the harder it will be to find.  Mega Man ZX Legacy only came out a month or two ago I believe and since it's release, it has been sold out of every single store that I have come across and many including the popular retailers like Target, BestBuy, and WalMart will not even ship the game and force you to purchase it in store.  When you go online to check for inventory though they have none in stock, and I've been waiting since its release date just to even 'see' a copy of the game being sold in stores.  I eventually gave in and paid $8 more than MSRP for it on eBay and had no choice because Amazon and the other game sellers on the internet haven't had any stock since it's original release and people are starting to price-gouge on eBay for a game that to my knowledge should be available everywhere in mass quantities...after all it's Mega Man and these games on the collection have already been out for decades now and they've just ported them all over to the Switch for $29.99.  How does Capcom and/or the retailers manage to vastly underestimate the amount of copies they would need in order to fulfill customers' demands for this particular game.  It's not the first time I've paid more than MSRP for a Switch game even after being months old as I had a heck of a time hunting down Street Fighter 30th Anniversary but managed to purchase the last copy in my entire 100 mile radius by driving to the Target across town and picking it up for $19.99.  Since then it's been much easier after that to find after six months or so had passed but I can recall people selling it for almost double what the MSRP actually was which blew my mind.  

Don't get me wrong, I'm not bothered by this fact because it's futile to get upset over having to pay a premium for a Switch game and it would be one of the stupidest first world problems to have in the first place, but I am genuinely curious as to why this happens more often with Switch games than any other console (that I've seen any how).  I'm amassing a very large library of cartridge-only games because I'm going out of the country soon and I want to have plenty of titles for my Switch that I can go back and play when I get bored or want to play games.  In fact, I've purchaed 20 different cartridge games on eBay, Amaon, and locally over the last month or so and thanks to Reddit managed to purchase the vast majority of my physical copies for less than $20 each when they normally cost $30-40 in store.  I still can't help but wonder why there's such a shortage on certain titles and why the shortages last for such a long time.  *Insert COVID-19 joke here*",6,1584506113,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fkjs9a/why_are_some_nintendo_switch_games_so_much_more/,Games,1

fkdigi,Underwhere_Overthere,The 5 Best Super Mario 64 ROM Hacks,"Super Mario 64 ROM Hacking is nothing new, but in recent years the quality, length, and uniqueness of the hacks have increased tenfold. I'm going to talk about what I would consider my 5 favorites, but note that there's many more. They will all have 5 pictures each. If you're staying inside for the foreseeable future and are looking for some free entertainment, this could be the fix for you.

1. **Super Mario: Star Road** - [Click here for 5 pictures of the game](https://imgur.com/a/UQ7xjO3)By Skelux - 130 Stars - 2011 - This ROM hack was one of the earliest to be a full game while having an all around great level of quality. This set the standard for future ROM hacks and is still probably the best today.

2. **Super Mario 64 Land:** - [Click here for 5 pictures of the game -](https://imgur.com/a/8B5tK8n) By Kaze Emanuar - 131 Stars - 2019 - This ROM hack plays more like Super Mario 3D Land/World in its design in that the levels are linear, but there are stars along the way. Each of the 33 levels and 8 bosses are totally unique. Each level has its own theme that incorporates the world theme. Mario's move-set has also expanded to include an aerial dive, butt bounce, and mid-air hover. 

3. **Super Mario: Last Impact** - [Click here for 5 pictures of the game](https://imgur.com/a/rOroM0i) - By Kaze Emanuar - 130 Stars - 2016 - This ROM hack took the creator Kaze Emanuar 4000 hours to complete. It is what I would consider the single most technically impressive Super Mario 64 ROM hacks and one of the best designed as well. There are 12 new power-ups, a ton of custom assets, and many newly designed bosses.

4. **Mario Party 64** - [Click here for 5 pictures of the game](https://imgur.com/a/sFOXBi3) - By MrComit - 70 Stars - 2019 - This ROM hack takes the original Mario Party boards and makes platforming stages out of them to great results. In addition, many mini games are recreated too, and sound effects from the original Mario Party are used.

5. **Sunshine Secret Book 64** - [Click here for 5 pictures of the game](https://imgur.com/a/nw6ciaA) - By GomePlayTV - 40 Stars - 2019 - This ROM hack mixes things up a bit by having Shine Sprites in place of Stars. All the levels are well crafted and the challenges are varied and creative. That may sound like a generic compliment, but you do see many repetitive ROM hacks where you feel like you're repeating the same motions over and over again, but not with this one.

**Honorable Mentions** 

* **Super Mario Sapphire** - [Click here for 5 pictures of the game](https://imgur.com/a/0gwRMaA) - By Nebula - 30 Stars - 2017 - A fun game to run through if you're looking for something quick. The design stays closer to Super Mario 64 than the other games, but it still has many of its own ideas.

* **Peach's Memory** - By Daniel EDC - 60 Stars - 2019

**Other popular Super Mario 64 ROM Hacks:** Super Mario 74, Super Mario 64: The Green Stars, Super Mario and the Marvel Adventure, Super Slide 64, Peach's Christmas Invitation, Super Mario x Ocarina of Time, Super Donkey Kong 64, Super Mario and the Cursed Castles, and Super Mario Maker 64.",33,1584480652,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fkdigi/the_5_best_super_mario_64_rom_hacks/,Games,4

fkcs5h,BuschMaster_J,Anyone know any good one handed games? Could be for any system or Mac.,"Hey all,

I live with my Dad and my grandma and we've quarantined ourselves for the foreseeable future because they have a ton of risk factors for corona to be quite bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any recommendations for games either of them can play? I have an xb1 somewhere (we just moved) and he uses a iMac. Engaging phone games are alright as well but not preferred (due to small screen size). We can order any system if we need to (money isn't too tight but something like building/buying a PC for this purpose isn't realistic.)

&amp;#x200B;

My grandma has never played video games before and my Dad only has the use of his left hand. My Dad used to game a bit back in the day, he beat Mario on the SNES years ago with one hand, but also probably isn't as agile as he used to be. My grandmother is quite used to socializing so it's rough for her.

I'm looking for one-handed games my dad can play and/or games my grandmother might find entertaining.

&amp;#x200B;

fkc9pw,Pants_for_Bears,"[Spoilers] Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs contains, in my opinion, the most powerful monologue in all of gaming","
I’ve been playing the Amnesia games again recently on my Switch and it’s had me thinking about a scene from A Machine for Pigs that’s stuck with me ever since I first played the game when it released: the Engineer’s monologue at the end, which I think is brilliantly written and powerful on its own, but is truly elevated by the stellar voice acting and the gorgeous musical track that plays behind it. The way the music swells in time to the speaker’s rising voice gives me goosebumps every time. [You should absolutely watch it if you haven’t seen it](https://youtu.be/PfpPnmkkaDw), but I’ll include the speech in text here as well:

*I have stood knee deep in mud and bone and filled my lungs with mustard gas! I have seen two brothers fall. I have lain with holy wars and copulated with the autumnal fallout! I have dug trenches for the refugees. I have murdered dissidents where the ground never thaws and starved the masses into faith! A child's shadow burnt into the brickwork, a house of skulls in the jungle. The Innocent, the innocent, Mandus! Trapped and bled and gassed and starved and beaten and murdered and enslaved! This is your coming century. They will eat them, Mandus. They will make pigs of you all and they will bury their snouts into your ribs and they will eat your hearts!*

I want to call attention to this speech because, in my opinion, it’s one of the most powerful moments I’ve ever experienced in gaming, and it comes from a game that a lot of people tend to think of as a disappointment. A Machine for Pigs will always have a special place in my heart and this scene alone is a big reason why.",3,1584476297,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fkc9pw/spoilers_amnesia_a_machine_for_pigs_contains_in/,Games,0

I usually play on whatever the normal difficulty is. There are plenty of times where I'm going through the game and I just get bored, because there's a lack of real challenge. But going on a harder difficulty, there have been multiple times where I hit a wall and, after several tries, I simply don't feel like I'm good enough to get through the game. But in both cases, I don't want to change because that's hours of gameplay lost, and the game just isn't nearly as fun when I'm playing just to get back to where I was before.

Achievements can be handled however the developer likes, but in this age, there's no reason difficulty settings need to be a static thing.",14,1584467456,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fk9mqw/every_game_with_difficulty_settings_should_let/,Games,0

fk5yyl,CleganeForHighSepton,Half Life Alyx Story Theory: The 'prequel-sequel',"One of the great problems with prequels is that, to greater and lesser degrees, you know what is going to happen to the characters in the story. It can be hard for some people to truly invest in a struggle from the past when, either from previous games, movies or films, you know that there are whole other stories involving the same characters, where the stakes will be raised to an ever higher point, where you truly never know from one moment to the next who will win or lose, live or die. 

I'm more and more convinced that the HL: Alyx will stand quite happily on its gaming mechanics alone, and that Valve are not terrified by the above concern re: the narrative challenges of prequels. And yet, I also think there's no question that this narrative issues means doing a prequel is never ideal, and that Valve would have noticed this potential stumbling block.

Thankfully for Valve, we are in the world of sci-fi, with aliens from alternate dimensions, G-Men from a time and space as yet unknown, portals, gravity defying weapons... the final element to this smorgasboard of science fiction seems clear: time travel. 

My touch-stone here is the somewhat obscure film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. The movie came out after the end of the second season of TV show, Twin Peaks, but was a prequel, delving into the life of the character who was murdered before the first episode of the first season. And yet, with a somewhat similar inclusion of portals and alternative dimension, at points the film becomes a prequel-sequel, with elements of the plot in the TV show working its way backwards through time to influence the 'prequel' movie. 

I predict something very similar to happen in HL: Alyx. We're going to get a traditional prequel plot, defeat X or blow up Y, save Z, etc. There will be fun in this for the fans as we piece together how our actions set the table for Half Life 2, little breadcrumbs and easter eggs will be everywhere, I'm sure (much like Fire Walk With Me). However, at some point there will be a transition, perhaps some new technology or alien portal or G-man madness that changes things. 

Perhaps past Alyx will be temporarily thrust forward in time, (e.g. to prevent the end of HL: Episode 2, for example). Perhaps this will be just for a moment, like Gordon's teleporting at the start of HL: 2. However I'm more and more convinced that this moment is coming. We all crave some kind of continuation of the Half Life story from that point at the end of Ep. 2. I think Valve is going to give that to us, at least to some small extend, effectively having their cake (the clean slate of a prequel story) and eating it too (by touching on post-HL: 2 material).",6,1584454572,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fk5yyl/half_life_alyx_story_theory_the_prequelsequel/,Games,1

&gt;Persona 5 Royal is proof that even the best games can be made better by acknowledging shortcomings and addressing them, however small they are.

&gt;Aside from any additional content, Persona 5 is one of the best games of this generation; A game that elevated the JRPG genre and made the Persona series the king of it. Now Royal has turned this gem into a better version of itself and this is enough reason to experience this version. Persona 5 Royal deserves the highest amount of praise and recognition.

&gt;Persona 5 Royal takes an already stellar game and reinvigorates it with content that is sure to please both fans of the original and those playing the game for the first time.

-------------

**[Digitally Downloaded](https://opencritic.com/outlet/65/digitally-downloaded)** - [Matt Sainsbury](https://opencritic.com/critic/1604/matt-sainsbury) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2020/03/review-persona-5-royal-sony-playstation.html)

&gt;Persona 5's excesses and its thematic step backwards are issues, but the raw gameplay is so enjoyable, and the characters so vibrant and well-written, that I haven't minded having the excuse to play through the bloat again. Not by any means.

-------------

&gt;Persona 5 Royal improves on the original in almost countless ways, big and small, to deliver a top-notch RPG for new and old fans alike.

-------------

**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - [Rudy Jean-François](https://opencritic.com/critic/3737/rudy-jean-fran-ois) - *French* - [10 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/3623-persona-5-royal-ps4)

&gt;Whether you played Persona 5 or not, Persona 5 Royal is simply a must play for everyone. There is more content with updated gameplay mechanics that make the game even more enjoyable than before. The new confidants add a new layer to Joker, deepening our understanding of its psyche and our immersion in the process. Persona 5 Royal is just better than a Persona 5 overhaul.

-------------

**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - *German* - [10 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-persona-5-royal/)

&gt;Persona 5' was rightly praised three years ago with loud hymns of praise. This royal update puts the crown on one of the best JRPGs of the last years. Atlus has consistently honed the few edges and quirks of their fantastic role-playing game and refreshed the gaming experience with countless, useful innovations and comfort decisions. The interesting new additions to the character set fit so homogeneously into the plot that I often caught myself thinking that they had always been part of the story. Moreover, the first-time implementation of German screen texts finally breaks the language barrier, which kept many players at a distance despite their interest. This now opens the door to a fantastic roleplaying game for new players and I can only emphasize: if you can do something with the staging, hit it. And if not, at least take a look at it, because all the praise for Atlus' wacky adventure about students stealing the hearts of depraved people in their spare time is more than justified. All Persona 5 veterans, however, must consider whether the new features are worth diving into the metaverse once again for countless hours. Anyway, I was amazed how quickly 'Royal' managed to tie me up and bring me back into the world of Persona 5. The many meaningful and affectionate innovations once again sparked my old passion for Atlus' sensational roleplaying game.

**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Pramath](https://opencritic.com/critic/1195/pramath) - [10 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/persona-5-royal-review-takes-your-heart)

&gt;Taking a great game and making it even better, Persona 5 Royal is near perfect, and the definitive way of playing one of the greatest games ever made.

-------------

**[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer)** - [Adam Beck](https://opencritic.com/critic/873/adam-beck) - [4.5 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&amp;p=369508)

&gt;Persona 5 Royale is a marvelous victory lap.

-------------

**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - [Álvaro Alonso](https://opencritic.com/critic/3755/-lvaro-alonso) - *Spanish* - [97 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-persona-5-royal-ps4-joya-espanol-601447)

&gt;If Persona 5 was a diamond, the Royal version, with a gigantic amount of changes and improvements, is the treasure of the palace. The spanish localization is the gold that covers it all, and the final detail that makes it a truly invaluable gem for any thief, new or veteran.

-------------

**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Joe Apsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/5592/joe-apsey) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/persona-5-royal-ps4-review/)

&gt;Persona 5: Royal is the definitive Persona 5 experience.  Atlus has refined the already excellent base game, trimming the rigid, sharp edges and creating a smoother experience filled with new and interesting activities, characters, story moments, and even an entirely new palace and optional ending to the game. Persona 5: Royal is one of the best JRPG's on PS4 for both new and returning players.

&gt;The gist of it is though; this is more than just a few updates slapped on top of an existing game, it's a complete rethinking of the major and minor components that made the original what it was.

-------------

&gt;Persona 5 Royal isn't just my favorite Atlus re-release, it might just be my new favorite Atlus game of all time.

-------------

**[Rice Digital](https://opencritic.com/outlet/513/rice-digital)** - [Zac Cocken](https://opencritic.com/critic/6816/zac-cocken) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.ricedigital.co.uk/persona-5-royal-review-an-upgrade-in-every-way/)

&gt;Persona 5 Royal is a great opportunity for a replay, it adds enough meat to the already full bones of Persona 5, and will give you an extra 30+ hours at least of main content

-------------

**[Slant Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/318/slant-magazine)** - [Justin Clark](https://opencritic.com/critic/1331/justin-clark) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review-with-persona-5-royal-a-masterful-game-rises-to-greatness/)

&gt;The game speaks in specific and effective ways to the sheer exhaustion of living in perpetual strife.

-------------

&gt;Persona 5 Royal is the best version of one of the best JRPGs of all time. And it adds subtitles support for many new languages. These should be reasons enough to go out and buy it ASAP.

-------------

**[Twinfinite](https://opencritic.com/outlet/21/twinfinite)** - [Zhiqing Wan](https://opencritic.com/critic/80/zhiqing-wan) - [4.5 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2020/03/persona-5-royal-review-looking-cool-kasumi/)

&gt;The additions introduced in Royal allow Persona 5 to become the excellent JRPG it was always truly meant to be, and it’s a wonderful effort that will surely be appreciated by fans.

-------------

**[We Got This Covered](https://opencritic.com/outlet/19/we-got-this-covered)** - [Cheyenne Clark](https://opencritic.com/critic/5772/cheyenne-clark) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/persona-5-royal-review/)

&gt;Persona 5 Royal offers so many changes to the core game that it feels fresh, all while keeping its original charm and style. With a brand new story arc and characters, as well as combat mechanics and updates to the social aspects, it's, without a doubt, the definitive way to play Persona 5.

-------------

**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - Albert Santos - [9 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/persona-5-royal-review/)

I've heard that The Last of Us Part 2 will be revolutionary because of its deep 30 hour storytelling and animations, however I've also heard that it will just be more of the same as not much has changed except for the obvious bump in graphics and smoother gameplay.

On the other hand, I've heard that Cyberpunk 2077 will be a completely fresh open world- one like never seen before and is full to the brim with customization, high quality content and a breathtaking (get it?) city just waiting to be explored!

So can you guys please persuade me to buy one of those games? I only have money to buy one of them....",7,1584438952,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fk2mmd/last_of_us_part_2_vs_cyberpunk_2077/,Games,1

Going to 4k Native and 60fps alone eats a ton of power...I'd actually rather have a game rendered at 1080p and 30fps next gen and use all that power into graphical bells and whistles as I generally prefer it over resolution and  higher frame rates.",67,1584435729,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fk21nm/im_worried_about_graphical_quality_suffering_due/,Games,1

The idea of the page is far from original: to provide spoiler-free hints for computer games. Spoiler-free here means that by reading the hint the player does not get unwanted information about future events in the game. Usual walkthroughs contain, usually, too much information. This idea was originally implemented in Universal Hint System ([http://www.uhs-hints.com/](http://www.uhs-hints.com/)) but that site has not published new hints since 2011 (or something).

What game would you like to see this kind of hints for? Would you be willing to write those hints yourself for your favorite game?

fjs4uu,Omen111,Portal is overrated,"Portal is often hailed as one of the best games of all times, howerer, imo its really overrated. Let me elebrate:

1. Gameplay is actually boring. You just shot portals and thats it. The only nuance, is saved momentum. After you learn that, you basicly know everything there is to know about portal gun and movements. And one of main reason for boringness is:
2. Most levels are bland and boring(and for some reason, level design is praised here). Most of them looks the same, differences are small, and only in added new ""gimmicks"" and structure. Every level has a gimmick from previous ones, which basicly defeats purpose of gimmicks.(of course there are exeptions from, like companion cube, first level with sentries and escape sequance(that mostly still is boring, aside from few moments)) And they are also easy and have almost  zero replayability. And every secret is basicly the same, and if you seen one, you seen everything. Also final boss is hella lot dissapointing.
3. Plot isnt really anything amazing. It has almost zero twists(Oh no, a crazy AI betrayed me, WhO cOuLd HaVe PrEdIcTeD tHaT!!!), no nuances and exactly one character. World building is also non existent.
4. Portal 2. Its better in every way possible, and there almost no reason to play first one, when second exists.
5. Its short. Its so short, you can complite the game and refund it succesfully.

But just because i think its overrated, doesnt mean its bad. It had pretty original idea, GLADOS was bloody amazing and was practicly caring this game by herself, music is good, code is good and had some cool moments.

The new consoles will likely make 4k FMV necessary and you can imagine the space that takes up on your PC or console.

I would be very happy to have that space back and rely on my internet connection to stream intro movies and cinematics.

It would be a toggle of course, so you can always download them if you desire or are going to be without internet.

fjq69k,waspglop,Help a gamer out!,"Hello Reddit friends,

I normally would never do something like this, but I thought I’d give this a shot and hope for the best.

Today, I was visiting my college to go and pick up the rest of my items and such since the coronavirus cancelled all my classes. After I got back home, I opened up one of the drawers underneath my bed (where my video games and movies are stored) and my cat suddenly jumped out and ran away. I thought that was strange, so I looked into the drawers and there was cat piss everywhere.

Now, obviously I’m not mad at the cat since I probably didn’t see her and accidentally trapped her in the drawer, but I am livid at the situation. All of my DS/3DS game cases are done for (the games weren’t in them, thankfully), and a decent chunk of my PS4 games are, too. The thing is, most of those games were gifts from either family members or my girlfriend, so they do hold a special place for me.

My mom’s not really sympathetic about the situation, but she barely gets paid enough as it is, so I understand her not wanting to replace things. I’m a broke college student, and I’m not working at the moment because of the pandemic, so money’s tight right now.

And trust me, I would completely understand if you skip this over and instead donated to a charity helping to fight said pandemic. But I’m sure most of you understand how important video games can be in our lives (especially when they’re given to you as gifts), and if any of you have any spare copies of these games or are willing to help me out in any way, I would be as grateful as someone possibly can be.

Thanks for reading. [Here are the damaged games, if you’re interested.](https://imgur.com/gallery/zrGtvrj)

&gt;Animal Crossing is back with New Horizons. A game that feels big, polished and absolutely addictive. Ninteno has managed to create yet another entry in the series that has enough changes without leaving behind the feeling and philosophy of Animal Crossing.

-------------

**[Ars Technica](https://opencritic.com/outlet/362/ars-technica)** - [Sam Machkovech](https://opencritic.com/critic/2302/sam-machkovech) - [Unscored](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-a-quarantined-life-has-never-been-cuter/)

&gt;Animal Crossing games have always delivered a compelling version of self-quarantine, and this one overflows with quantity, without sacrificing quality, to do so at a scale series fans have never seen.

**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Jordan Biordi](https://opencritic.com/critic/378/jordan-biordi) - [10 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review/)

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons takes everything good about Animal Crossing, and improves it ten-fold.

&gt;If you’ve ever had even a whiff of interest in this franchise, Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be an absolute slam dunk. Don’t sleep on this one for a second.

-------------

**[Critical Hit](https://opencritic.com/outlet/299/critical-hit)** - [Brad Lang](https://opencritic.com/critic/5914/brad-lang) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.criticalhit.net/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-whats-nookin-good-lookin/)

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a game that manages to be wholeheartedly cathartic, relaxing and adorable for every second you play despite some legacy flaws and clunky menus that may vex just a little too much

-------------

**[Daily Mirror](https://opencritic.com/outlet/561/daily-mirror)** - [Jasper Pickering](https://opencritic.com/critic/5469/jasper-pickering) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/animal-crossing-new-horizons-reviewthe-21688445)

&gt;Long time fans of Animal Crossing will have plenty to love with New Horizons and for younger players who may be unfamiliar with past entries, the appeal will become immediately apparent in its presentation. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a must play for any Nintendo Switch owner.

-------------

**[Daily Star](https://opencritic.com/outlet/686/daily-star)** - [Rebecca Stow](https://opencritic.com/critic/4972/rebecca-stow) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-21699781)

&gt;Similar to how Breath of the Wild and Odyssey reimagined 3D Zelda and Mario, New Horizons represents an exciting new milestone for the Animal Crossing series.

-------------

**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [CJ Andriessen](https://opencritic.com/critic/456/cj-andriessen) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-animal-crossing-new-horizons-583381.phtml)

&gt;Honestly, 18 days is far too little time to generate a comprehensive assessment of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. There is still much I don't know about this game, including how in-game purchases will ultimately be incorporated. But based on what I have been able to experience, it's what I've wanted Animal Crossing to be for many years. While it fumbles its camping-inspired opening, New Horizons makes a nice recovery with a strong focus on player accomplishment, creating a potent sense of achievement in this idyllic piece of escapism.

-------------

**[EGM](https://opencritic.com/outlet/38/egm)** - [Mollie L Patterson](https://opencritic.com/critic/167/mollie-l-patterson) - [Unscored](https://egmnow.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review/)

&gt;For now, Animal Crossing: New Horizons feels like a no-brainer for fans of the franchise, and a perfect place to start for newcomers—with the exception of ruining every other previous Animal Crossing game, should you ever want to go back to them.

-------------

**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Martin Robinson](https://opencritic.com/critic/765/martin-robinson) - [Essential](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-16-animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-a-magical-vivarium-and-one-of-nintendos-best-games-yet)

&gt;An impressive suite of improvements combine with a more clearly defined structure for Animal Crossing's finest outing to date.

-------------

**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Francesco Fossetti](https://opencritic.com/critic/2988/francesco-fossetti) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nuova-esclusiva-switch-47746.html)

&gt;It's a special game, Animal Crossing: New Horizons. An addictive diversion that allows you to escape from the daily routine to discover an alternative, made of flowers to plant, of strange talking animals, of a wandering disengagement between rivers and beaches.

-------------

**[Forbes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/290/forbes)** - [Dave Thier](https://opencritic.com/critic/1157/dave-thier) - [10 / 10](https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2020/03/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-the-game-we-all-need-right-now/)

&gt;Know that if you’re overwhelmed with the world, stuck inside, or adrift in a life that you know will look totally different next week — get Animal Crossing.

-------------

**[Game Informer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer)** - [Jeff Cork](https://opencritic.com/critic/1034/jeff-cork) - [9 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons/a-wholesome-island-oasis-animal-crossing-new-horizons-review)

&gt;A new challenge system reinvigorates the familiar core, providing a wonderful incentive to explore all of Animal Crossing's myriad activities. This cheerful life sim is the next best thing to an actual vacation

-------------

**[GameMAG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag)** - *Russian* - [9 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-obzor)

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons significantly expands the functionality of New Leaf, but remains the same familiar game in the genre of contemplative life simulator. It is a very competent, detailed project of amazing, subtle beauty, which must be in the collection of every owner of the Nintendo Switch.

-------------

**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Ann-Kathrin Kuhls](https://opencritic.com/critic/5070/ann-kathrin-kuhls) - *German* - [90 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/animal-crossing-new-horizons-test,3355506.html)

&gt;Animal Crossing New Horizons creates a versatile and deep life simulation despite peaceful island life.

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons gives you more creative freedom and more to do on any given day while preserving what makes the series special.

-------------

**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - [Yann Bernard](https://opencritic.com/critic/3742/yann-bernard) - *French* - [9 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/3622-animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch)

&gt;The fresh thrill of discovering an uninhabited atoll tends to fade once such wild life gets cosier with crafted items, buildings, shops and incoming residents, until it looks like a village from the previous iterations. But the larger size of this wholly reshapable island, the customization's vertiginous level and the improved community interactions create an even more fertile ecosystem, hence Animal Crossing can slowly though decidedly stare further, towards New Horizons, equipped with an ever updating NookPhone.

-------------

**[GamesBeat](https://opencritic.com/outlet/78/gamesbeat)** - [Jeff Grubb](https://opencritic.com/critic/1047/jeff-grubb) - [95 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review/)

&gt;The best thing I can say about New Horizons is that I think it's going to win over some players who previously bounced off the franchise. And it will do so without losing any longtime fans in the process. Those players will find more to love than ever before.

-------------

**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Sam Loveridge](https://opencritic.com/critic/1791/sam-loveridge) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review/)

&gt;There continues to be nothing quite like Animal Crossing, and New Horizons proves that there's life in the old Nook yet.

-------------

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons is not for everyone. Its snail-pace progression may turn you off and its tedious mechanics can be an issue to get through at times. However, it acts as an escape from the world for a few hours where you can build your dream island, run around in the rain in your undies and catch a whale shark with a flimsy fishing rod. There’s a lot to love about the game but there’s also a lot to hate. One thing is for sure, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is like adopting a pet, you will be stuck with it for months and years ahead as you nurture it and love it every single day.

**[God is a Geek](https://opencritic.com/outlet/111/god-is-a-geek)** - [Adam Cook](https://opencritic.com/critic/569/adam-cook) - [10 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review/)

&gt;A beautiful, welcoming game that is everything and anything you want it to be. This is one you'll play all year and beyond, and it's exactly what the world needs right now.

-------------

**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - [David Martinez](https://opencritic.com/critic/2884/david-martinez) - *Spanish* - [88 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-596257)

&gt;Animal Crossing New Horizons adds new customization elements, tools, objects and activities to the classic formula. It´s not a game for everybody, but fans will love it.

-------------

**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Samuel Claiborn](https://opencritic.com/critic/218/samuel-claiborn) - [9 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch)

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an expanded, polished, next-generation reboot of a classic Nintendo game that's full of surprises.

&gt;I know this can’t last forever. But in the meantime, I’m going to absorb as much from my time here as possible in the hopes of taking at least a little bit of Aurora back with me.

-------------

**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - [9 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-island-paradise-12405488/)

&gt;Animal Crossing finally gets a sequel that moves the franchise forward, in a surprisingly timely release that is perfect for this year in terms of both its gameplay and its philosophy.

**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [Alex Olney](https://opencritic.com/critic/917/alex-olney) - [10 / 10](http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons)

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons takes Animal Crossing and not only drags it back onto home consoles, but improves upon every single facet imaginable.

-------------

**[NintendoWorldReport](https://opencritic.com/outlet/138/nintendoworldreport)** - [Daan Koopman](https://opencritic.com/critic/1516/daan-koopman) - [Unscored](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/53204/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-review)

&gt;Even after all these years, there is a daily routine that I hold dear and makes me adore the various elements that glue this game together. It has been sharply dialed up to eleven, without disagrading any newcomers.

-------------

**[Polygon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/87/polygon)** - [Russ Frushtick](https://opencritic.com/critic/1503/russ-frushtick) - [Unscored](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/16/21178911/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch)

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a respite from the current state of the world. I find my general anxiety slowly subside as I run through my town, water my plants, and build furniture for the sassy chicken gentleman living down by the beach. It’s exactly what I need right now.

-------------

**[Screen Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/664/screen-rant)** - [Cody Gravelle](https://opencritic.com/critic/1828/cody-gravelle) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://screenrant.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review/)

&gt;Tom Nook's latest venture is profitable for fans and villagers alike.

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons easily wins the ""best entry in the series"" title, bringing in much needed new content in the franchise.

-------------

**[Telegraph](https://opencritic.com/outlet/28/telegraph)** - [Jack Rear](https://opencritic.com/critic/6968/jack-rear) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-chilled-out-life-simulator/)

&gt;While a deserted island is the setting for a shedload of games, from Fortnite to Far Cry, none have ever tried very hard to live up to the Desert Island Discs dream that most of us have fantasised about at one time or another.

-------------

**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - [Erica Mura](https://opencritic.com/critic/5478/erica-mura) - *Italian* - [9.4 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/animal-crossing-new-horizons-recensione-switch/)

&gt;If you've never played a game in the series, New Horizons is a great start. On the other hand, if you are already familiar with Animal Crossing, you will find a good amount of nostalgia but also pleasant little news, which will make this new adventure worthy of being lived day by day.

-------------

**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Stefan L](https://opencritic.com/critic/313/stefan-l) - [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review/)

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the perfect island escape, drawing you in to play day after day. All of the charms of the series' previous games are here, but with gorgeous new graphics, DIY crafting and the eventual ability to remodel your island, you can really create the island settlement of your dreams.

**[TrustedReviews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/326/trustedreviews)** - [Jade King](https://opencritic.com/critic/5922/jade-king) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons)

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the best game I've played this year, and immediately cements itself as one of the generation's defining experiences. Fans will be playing it for years, watching as the seasons roll by and unveil the true potential of what has been created here.

-------------

**[USgamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/66/usgamer)** - [Caty McCarthy](https://opencritic.com/critic/2089/caty-mccarthy) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review)

&gt;With real-world headlines more harrowing than ever, there's never been a better time to go on vacation within Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

-------------

**[VG247](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247)** - [Alex Donaldson](https://opencritic.com/critic/1621/alex-donaldson) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.vg247.com/2020/03/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review/)

&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons is everything I hoped it would be, and it’s yet another stellar release that showcases a confident Nintendo at its best. It is excellent, and is easily another must-own Switch title – at least, if you can understand and embrace Animal Crossing’s uniquely lazy pace.

-------------

**[Wccftech](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech)** - [Dave Aubrey](https://opencritic.com/critic/1303/dave-aubrey) - [9.4 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/)

&gt;I adore Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and this is quickly becoming one of my most-played games on Nintendo Switch. If you've ever had a love slow-paced social sims like Animal Crossing or The Sims, this game is essential.

fjl13d,Peeka789,Halo: Reach on Legendary vs. Halo: CE on Legendary,"It's been an interesting experience jumping from the last Bungee Halo game to the first one. The quality of the ports aside (i personally think the ports of the campaigns are acceptable), the most jarring thing to me was just how much more insanely hard Reach is compared to CE (on Legendary). Reach is SO MUCH HARDER than CE. I've been playing through CE recently, and while it's not a breeze or anything it's never got to the point where the game feels totally hopeless. Maybe im just not very good at it but Reach borders on bullshit difficulty IMO.  

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that kills it for me is that on legendary you have an extremely limited ammo stock, while the enemies get to barrage you with unlimited ammo. For instance, if an enemy has a fuel rod cannon, they will bombard you with shots the second you leave. But if you pick up their gun after killing them you only get two shots or something. CE also does this but for some reason it never feels as cheap as Reach, it always feels conquerable. In Reach You have to be dead accurate with every bullet AND hope the AI behaves in a way where they don't run away and hide to generate their shield. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there some gameplay aspect i'm missing here? Surely, i am. There is no way Reach is supposed to feel this difficult. Like, poke your head out and instantly die kind of difficult. I'm approaching the encounters in Halo CE and Reach in nearly identical fashion. Maybe my approach is bad? Or maybe i just plain suck at the game?",1,1584365673,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fjl13d/halo_reach_on_legendary_vs_halo_ce_on_legendary/,Games,1

fjkbly,Kenshisen,Ultimate Knight Windom XP: I'm seeking for mods,"I once was used to play UK Windom XP with my brother pc, it's an old game that few people remember for what I saw, but me and my brother loved it because it was full of Mods to add or substitute the mechs in the game.
Unfortunatley, I searched intensly for those mods in various sites that all seems to be closed, but I'm really not giving up!

Does anyone hold any mod for the game and is willing to share that with me? Any kind of mod will be good, trow everything that you have.

In alternative: does anyone know how to mod the game? Is it something hard to do or you can just swap models/animations? Is there any specific software I need to use?",1,1584362455,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fjkbly/ultimate_knight_windom_xp_im_seeking_for_mods/,Games,1

fjg41b,Mechaghostman2,The original Gameboy was 13 years out of date when it came out.,"The CPU in the original Gameboy (and Gameboy Color) is a Sharp LR35902, which is really just a modified Zilog Z80. The Gameboy launched in 1989, while the Zilog Z80 processor launched back in 1976.

People always say that consoles are 2 years out of date by PC standards when they come out, well in this case they're off by a factor of 6. The Gameboy was so out of date that its processor pre-dates Star Wars by 1 year.

But hey, it sold more than the Gamegear and Lynx. Plus the original Gameboy had 30 hours of battery life, and its older hardware meant that not only was it cheap, but developers knew how to use it to its fullest potential almost immediately on launch.",17,1584338255,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fjg41b/the_original_gameboy_was_13_years_out_of_date/,Games,1

fj9bgk,Bucksan,Tip of my tongue - Can't remember an old game I liked. Help?,"This is a looooooong shot, I know. With quarantine and whatnot I'm looking for old games I liked and want to play again. I have a vivid memory of a tiny little piece of a game I really liked, but I can't remember ANYTHING else, apart from the fact that I'd like to play it again. So here goes:

* It was an RPG. Can't remember if US, JRPG or MMO.
* There's a gameplay section of the game I remember. It wasn't in the beginning, more likely mid-part or late-game.
* The piece that I remember is a more or less circular map, large to very-large, surrounded by unpassable mountains. There were a few nooks to explore (maybe a camp to save? Can't recall), but overall the gameplay happened inside the large, circular map.
* Inside the map was lush, luxuriant natural life and a partly ""plains"", partly ""jungle"" feel.
* There were small and large tar pits dotting the otherwise green landscape.
* The enemies were dinosaurs, like triceratops and pterodactyls. Were there robots? I can't say...
* My task as a player, aside from grinding, was to collect various brightly colored crystals on the ground. Blue Green Yellow Red.
* This task as made harder by the fact that some enemies (T-Rex?) were over-levelled and essentially unkillable.

So there we have it. Can anyone remember better than me, in which game this vague memory is?

In hopes this may motivate public through gamers cleaning the real world by setting standard habits of personal cleanliness and attributing them with in-game incentives &amp; rewards. Hope people may be interested, comment below I'll continue editing and refining.

[Clever title, ""CleanWorld""]

A (Mobile/Website) RPG that connects real world items/actions correlateing to in-game elements and events.  Lvl ranking attributed to completing incremental tasks to decontaminate, sterilize and maintain clean rooms from bedroom&gt;house/apt&gt;building&gt;work/office/shop/base.  Locations are IRL ala Foursquare, with badges and Pokemon Go style AR of ""clean"" vs world and other creative possibilities that incentivize daily/active routine to maintain cleanliness rating.  Items have qualities dependant on brand/type/concentration/sterilization efficiency/availability/combination/consistency.  

Game style to be determined, simpler, iconic (Fallout, BioShock) GUI/font design should not too dystopic, and maintain professional accuracy, credibility of all information relevant to appropriate level of sanitation standards. 


Rough ideas below:

Items (such as, not limited to)
 --PPE--
 -Disposable gloves
 -Face mask&lt;goggles&lt;shield&lt;respirator (N95&lt;)
 -Aprons&lt;Gowns&lt;Hoods&lt;Suits
 -Boot coverings
 
--Cleaners--
 -Disinfectants (sprays, bulk/portable, %/vol)
 -Sanitizers/Soaps/Wipes
 -Single use/packs

Consumables:
-First Aid
-Cough drops
-Tea/Coffee/Energy
-etc.

Ex.
 - Disinfectants (Cleaning products, sprays, sanitizers, detergents/soaps) rank from most effective/skin-safe to caustics, acids

 - Clean room (Lvl1) - basic cleaning/sterilization of major surfaces, (L2)floor, walls &amp; celling, (L3) air, filter &amp; circulate (L4)seal doors/windows (L5) sustainable/renewable energy

 - Sealed clean rooms/buildings must have an ""airlock"" to outside to be considered maintained clean, as clean rooms re-exposed to contaminated air lose status.  (NYC style wind/cold door shelter)

---

Character stats
Lvl/HP corresponds to weight/height, age=lvl, HP=condition, preexisting, physicality, 

Avatar may not be required to be accurate to real life, but encourage as to accurately assess other affected RPG elements, interactions.

1. Design of GUI, player card with stats

fj6e64,Dexav,"COVID-19: Simple, free games to play online with non-gamer friends, in order to keep in touch during self-isolation?","Gonna be perfectly honest here: I'm one of the non-gamer friends.

Gonna be even more honest: while the title is rather general, I'm actually asking for a specific reason:

A birthday is coming up in our friend group, however it seems likely that we won't be able to hang out due to self-isolation rules.  
We thought of having a Skype Party, but I'm afraid that a dozen people all connected at once is going to be utter chaos.  
So instead I'm suggesting that we gather around a (or several) multi-player game(s) online, where we can still chat, but with something to focus our attention on. It would also be more fun!

But, as I don't know the first thing about video games, I'm looking for recommendations of what we can play. Here are some of the criteria:

\-Free or dirt-cheap, as it's really only for this occasion.  
\-Easy to use and connect to, as most of use don't have steam or consoles or basic game knowledge.  
\-Can accommodate a dozen people, though not necessarily all playing at once.  
\-Possible to chat about other stuff at the same time (i.e. doesn't need constant focused attention).  
\-Simple enough that even the most reticent non-gamers will still participate.  
\-Something party-game-ish or festive!

I hope that's not too strict, again I'm not a gamer and I have no idea if this is too unrealistic a request.

Thanks in advance for your help, and don't hesitate to share your experience with online gaming with non-gamer family and friends during these times of isolation!

fj5pn1,MikaelBoordock,Places that Persist,"As I sit in self-isolation (no symptoms but immune compromised family members), I was thinking about the places that video games take us and how some of them are so much more memorable than others.

What ones are the most memorable to you?

A short list of the ones that I remember most from 30+ years of gaming:


- *The first castle in Wardner.* After the first section is standard platforming, you find yourself in a very vertical castle with various mechanisms of death about. I always struggled to make it past here on one quarter in the arcade.

- *The Water Level in Sonic 1.* the marble, the water, the need for oxygen, the currents. This zone is burned into my memory. More so than the Starlight Zone which had way better music, but didn’t leave much of an impression.

- *The Medieval Age in Chrono Trigger.* Maybe it was the mist. Maybe it was the moody music. Maybe it was Frog or that it was the first time travel. But this time period had a stronger atmosphere than all the others.

- *The Eagle level in Golden Axe.* So cool.

- *Looking back on your ship on the beach in KOTOR*. At the time, it was so beautiful, and the mystery was starting to unravel.

- *The drowned section of New Marais in inFamous 2.* What a blast it was to go through this section.

fj4anu,wazatojanai,Granblue Fantasy Versus surprised me with a genuinely enjoyable single player experience.,"I know I know wtf who cares about single player in a fighting game. I'm a casual fighting game fan, meaning mostly watching and if I do buy a fighting game I don't go online (yes someone like this exists). I had a blast with the RPG mode in this game. 

Them calling it ""RPG"" is a bit of a stretch here because there's just a numbers game with upgrading equipment, but this was a genuinely good experience for me otherwise. The only previous ArcSys game I bought was Blazblue Centralfiction and the difference is night and day. To be fair that game was like the 4th or something in a series, but it just straight up did a 1 hour text dump to catch you up, and the training mode was a separate thing entirely. After that fights basically amounted to VS mode against the CPU but with some story flavour behind it, which is how every fighting game I've played has handled their story or arcade mode.

Meanwhile here in GBVS you get a beat em up mode where the game gradually introduces characters and their respective mechanics to you, all the while progressing the story (just serviceable, typical anime stuff). You can choose whoever you have unlocked to play any of the missions and bring a partner along with you. Already this is some nice variety, but the real kicker here is the boss fights. I was just expecting the typical 1 on 1 with equal balance, I did not expect 2 vs 1 multi phase raid boss style gameplay when I got to chapter 2, I was surprised how hyped I got playing some of these.

The only complaints I have are that it's too short (about 8-10 hours if you take your time, already pretty long for a fighter I know) and that using technical inputs in non boss battles is awkward because your character can actually turn the other way. Otherwise holy shit the RPG mode is good, every fighting game should have this from now on, to my knowledge there is no high profile fighting game that offers this, maybe I missed one a few years ago but SF 5, MK 11, Tekken 7, GG Xrd, BBCF, Samsho, DBFZ all don't have it. This is exactly the kind of stuff that gets casual players to enjoy learning your game and maybe stick around a bit.",56,1584291057,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fj4anu/granblue_fantasy_versus_surprised_me_with_a/,Games,1

fiz7zh,knighty33,Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a great iterative sequel but fails to capitalise on its own improvements (debatably some minor gameplay spoilers),"Ori and the Will of the Wisps has some very enjoyable combat and movement mechanics but sits in a weird spot between something like Hollow Knight and Celeste that leaves it unable to capitalise in the best way possible on those two systems.

First of all, I’d like to make it clear from the outset that Will of the Wisps is a fantastic experience. It takes almost everything from the first game and ramps it up another notch. The combat is the most obvious improvement, since it’s gone from effectively not existing to a very fluid and enjoyable combat model. Platforming has a wealth of new options that make the first game look positively quaint and slow in comparison (though I think the amount of extra options are a problem, which I’ll discuss later). Visually the first game was stunning and the sequel increases the scope of variety and plain volume of detail through extra clutter and dynamic lighting. Music felt like it lacked the best of the original ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwN1MEjUeGk nothing in WotW even comes close to this track ) but was still overall solid, and I enjoyed the new motif and wish it was explored more rather than an excessive reliance on “that” motif (you know the one) from the first game. Story-wise the game failed thematically for me, but I won’t really discuss that here too much because I want to focus on gameplay and not too much on spoiler-y stuff but it left me with a very hollow feeling with the conclusion of the antagonists story especially.

With that out of the way, I’d like to discuss my feelings on those important gameplay systems. Celeste is clearly a vastly different game to Ori, but they are both nonetheless platformers with a focus on precise movement and as an excellent and popular contemporary, Celeste makes for a good comparison for my points. In Celeste, each room is a very carefully constructed challenge that the player must execute perfectly (at least beyond the A sides) to complete. No matter who you are, how many times you enter the room, the challenge remains static. It is extremely fair to the player and this static nature allows the rooms to be precisely designed with satisfying solutions in mind. Ori’s health system which plays into its combat causes issues here. While the game has platforming challenges to overcome in a clearly intended way, it is very possible to brute force your way through many of the challenges that involve any kind of damage source. This is especially apparent in the last section of the game with the toughest challenges, which with a lot of health you can damage boost through chunks of. I feel the game would have been served better by making more of the threats posed to the player in these sections instant deaths or resets, especially considering the game is fine with spawning you back basically immediately on a safe bit of ground. 

The other problem here is straight up the amount of options the player has. Movement feels absolutely amazing and fluid in Ori, but considering by the end of the game you have about 5 different ways of keeping yourself in the air with abilities, plus an (optional) triple jump, the game never feels like it truly keeps up with Ori’s agility in its challenges. The end of the game comes close but that’s just 8 mini challenges. To compare it to a contemporary again, Hollow Knight doesn’t focus all that hard on platforming, but when it does it really makes the player use their smaller suite of abilities to get through places like the Path of Pain. I don’t really know what the best solution here is, whether it be better puzzles that make more use of the agility options or more restrictions on air based movement but I know for sure I didn’t feel like the game could keep up with me.

For the combat side of things we have to inevitably compare it to Hollow Knight and I think this comparison is even more unfavorable than putting the platforming against Celeste. Hollow Knight doesn’t have a huge amount of combat options a lot of the time, but those limited options are put to excellent use by enemy design that makes those simple options fun and satisfying. I think it exemplifies the issue that the most well designed and enjoyable combat in Ori for me was the Beetle near the start of the game. At that point Ori just has double jump and dash, and the moveset of the Beetle is designed to reflect that. It has a wave of fire to jump over with double jump and the key way the player is able to attack it is by dashing under it with the dash and attacking it from behind. This boss feels straight out of something like Hollow Knight, and for the better. Things start to fall apart on later bosses where you have things like triple jump, the ability to launch out of water, air floating with attacks and bash. Later bosses turn fighting into just flinging yourself up near their head and spamming attacks. There is minimal learning of attack patterns required, and a lot of their attacks feel unfair because that’s how they were designed to combat this huge amount of agility.

It’s frustrating to me because these systems on their own are fantastic but I don’t think the game knows how to best make use of them. The spirit trials are a nice way to test the player’s platforming skills and the combat challenges are a nice idea too, but neither go even remotely far enough. Again to compare to Hollow Knight, that game has the white palace (which is kind of optional) and path of pain (totally optional) to really test the player’s platforming skills and the combat arena (again, optional) to throw the player into really difficult combat scenarios. Maybe this will be addressed in DLC as I feel like some more optional things would go a long way into making the game more enjoyable. Even if there was more arena-like combat though, the lack of interesting enemy variety might not make this all that enjoyable anyway. This optional nature should also be further extended to the collectibles in game. This is a key area where something like Celeste has dynamic difficulty. The player doesn’t *need* to go and get all the strawberries, but they’re there for players who want more challenge and that should be something Ori leaned into more with its own collectibles. You can still have some that are easier for less skilled players to get, but for example, the fetch quest could have been a series of escalating platforming challenges to get the items required and have a totally non gameplay altering reward for those players looking for a little more challenge.

Perhaps a lot of these problems are actually caused by Ori’s outstanding presentation. I remember Team Cherry having talked about how trivial implementing enemies is for them. In a matter of a day or two they can go from an idea to an ingame usable prototype thanks to the game’s simple visuals and mechanics. Ori’s flashy presentation perhaps leaves us with at most 10 different types of enemies with limited move sets and variety. 

I do hope we get another game, or at least a spiritual successor which continues the improvements this game makes",30,1584267099,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fiz7zh/ori_and_the_will_of_the_wisps_is_a_great/,Games,1

fiwah9,w3nch,"Thinking about buying xenoblade chronicles 2, looking for opinions about the game!","Alright, so here's where I'm at:

I love a good RPG. I played the shit out of the dark souls series, Divinity original sin, salt and sanctuary, bioshock, legend of zelda series, some kingdom hearts, a bit of the witcher, etc. From the reviews that I've read, Xenoblade 2 seems like a well-liked and critically acclaimed game. From watching gameplay videos, I have a few first impressions.

First of all, the world design is extremely aesthetically pleasing. The game is gorgeous and looks massive. I love exploring and collecting shit, so that part seems right up my ally. I also enjoy character customization, optimizing, strategizing, etc, which again, seems like xenoblade has a lot of. The battle system looks clean, fun, and hashed-out.

The voice acting also looks great. Even if the dialogue is a little cheesy, I love how they all have heavy welsh accents, it's hilarious. It's something new and different, which is a definite positive for me.

However, I have a few reservations. First of all, is the story compelling? I don't mind a few corny, stereotypical tropes, but it seems like it might be approaching kingdom hearts level. Stuff like, ""But wait! The villain was actually a time-traveling cybernetic proto-projection of his anti-form all along! The REAL villain is living inside the protagonists soul essence, which has manifested itself into an astral projection...."" you get the point. I can roll with creative fantasy-world liberties, but I lose interest quickly when it gets to be over the top.

Secondly, the characters. The protagonist seems like a blissfully naive stereotypical anime character, which again, I can definitely deal with, but is there any real character development, or is he just this generic blank slate for the entire game? His sidekick, Pyra, gives me ""submissive broom with giant boobs"" vibe, and the characters personalities seem to fall into that classic anime ""either hot or angry"" trope. The protagonists band of adventures looks like a harem collectathon, where every companion has to be some waifu-ass bikini-wearing cat girl with sexual innuendos scattered throughout the game. Again, I can get passed this if the characters have depth, and actually develop to some extent as the game progresses. Should I expect realistic, distinct, and likable personalities from this game?

Thirdly, the gameplay/combat. I like to be challenged. I don't have a whole lot of free time, and considering this is a 80+ hour game, I want to sweat a little bit, and feel accomplished after a boss fight. If I die less than 20 times during the whole game, it's personally not enough of a challenge. I love story development, but I'm not looking for ""mostly story with some filler gameplay interspersed"". I wanted to get absolutely obliterated a few times and have to rethink my approach, try a new strategy, or ""get gud"". Does the game deliver any sort of challenge, or is more of a casual experience in that sense?

So did you personally enjoy the game? What did you like/dislike about it? Any opinions are much appreciated! Thanks",1,1584248742,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fiwah9/thinking_about_buying_xenoblade_chronicles_2/,Games,1

--------------------

**Game Title**: Black Mesa

**Platforms**:

- PC (Mar 5, 2020)

**Trailer**:

- [Black Mesa: Xen Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAIJich73NY)


**Developer**: Crowbar Collective
  
**Review Aggregator**:

**[OpenCritic - 84 average - 100% recommended - 8 reviews](https://opencritic.com/game/9106/black-mesa)**

Critic Reviews
-------------
    

**[Attack of the Fanboy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/116/attack-of-the-fanboy)** - [Brandon Adams](https://opencritic.com/critic/6501/brandon-adams) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/black-mesa-review/)

&gt;Black Mesa may show its age in some areas, but that doesn't detract from what is an otherwise stunning achievement. It's not only Half Life at its best - it's one of the finest shooters available today.

-------------

**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Rick Lane](https://opencritic.com/critic/767/rick-lane) - [Essential](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-05-black-mesa-review-a-masterful-remake-that-improves-upon-a-classic)

&gt;Finally complete after fourteen years, Crowbar Collective's remake is more than faithful to Valve's masterpiece.

-------------

**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Ravi Sinha](https://opencritic.com/critic/1193/ravi-sinha) - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/black-mesa-review-the-once-and-future-freeman)

&gt;It's been a long, long wait but Black Mesa is here. If you've never experienced Valve's original masterpiece, want to wax nostalgic about real story-telling in an FPS, or just want an excellent game to play, Black Mesa is where it's at.

-------------

**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Dan Stapleton](https://opencritic.com/critic/201/dan-stapleton) - [8 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/black-mesa-review)

&gt;Black Mesa is the best way to play the classic original 1998 Half-Life today, but it's a remake that already feels old enough that it would benefit from a remake itself.

-------------

**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - [8 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/10/black-mesa-review-definitive-half-life-experience-12374962/)

&gt;One of the best remakes ever, not because of its loving recreation of the original Half-Life but because it dares to change and improve it.

-------------

**[PC Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/162/pc-gamer)** - [Andy Kelly](https://opencritic.com/critic/137/andy-kelly) - [84 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/black-mesa-review/)

&gt;A quality remake that broadens the scope of the original and massively improves its final chapters.

-------------

**[PC Invasion](https://opencritic.com/outlet/176/pc-invasion)** - [8 / 10](https://www.pcinvasion.com/black-mesa-review/)

&gt;Black Mesa is dated in several ways and the new Xen levels have some issues, but this is an excellent experience that old fans of Half-Life and people who may have never played it before should absolutely check out.

-------------

**[WayTooManyGames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/742/waytoomanygames)** - [Kyle Nicol](https://opencritic.com/critic/6929/kyle-nicol) - [9 / 10](https://waytoomany.games/2020/03/09/review-black-mesa/)

&gt;The Crowbar Collective knew exactly what needed to be done to improve on the original. Not only is this a great game for fans of the original, but this is a perfect new entry point into the franchise.

fihnth,DrSeafood,Unusual health systems,"Many games have an on-screen health bar or heart containers, indicating how much ""damage"" you can take before dying. For example, Zelda shows hearts, Cuphead shows cards, Final Fantasy has numbers, Dark Souls has a red bar, Resident Evil 7 turns red at the edges of the screen, etc. 

The common thread is that there's a number representing your HP. This number depletes with damage, but typically you can replenish it with a ""potion"". Whether its hearts, cards, your spine (Dead Space!), or a red life bar, this system functions in a very basic way. Let's call this the ""classic health bar"".

Twists on this include: 

* Auto-heal: a lot of third person shooters (e.g. MGSV, Splatoon) show damage using a red tint on the border of the HUD, but your health recovers if you stand still for long enough. Some games have replenishable ""shields"" (e.g. Goldeneye) that functions similarly to the classic health bar I described above. 
* Dropping coins: Mario and Sonic do not have health bars. When you take damage in Mario, you either lose your power-up if you have one, or else you die. In Sonic, you lose your rings if you have one, or else you die. 

Can we talk about more games with interesting ways of dealing with health/damage?

Note: Dead Space does not count. The HUD is interesting and unique, but I'm talking about the health system itself, not the visual display of it.",285,1584189184,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fihnth/unusual_health_systems/,Games,1
fihagv,EkoBasher__,Devs please stop putting slow interactive scenes into video games,"\*Rant\*

I dunno if that's the right wording for them but i'm talking about these moments in video games where you do things in a pre scripted scene like hold forward for 30sec-1min. If your story or action is that important that I MUST know it then just put in a cutscene. Examples are like ac games like odyssey (10/10 game) where you move through cracks in the wall and your just holding forward for like 30 seconds, just make it a single button and make the dude do it. Or you are walking with a npc and they are moving really slowly so you are forced to be like 10 steps behind them (I hear rdr2 is really bad for this (slow horse riding)) OR you walk to the quest marker and the npc stops because you got too far a head  most rpgs have these moments in them and it just gives this slowed down feeling like should I go get a rubber band and put in around my controller and go out for a smoke? I realise this is probably for a realism effect but if I had unlimited energy and didn't get injury from it I would run everywhere just like the PCs can. 

(its really hard to think of examples now that i'm writing it any other examples are appreciated)",1,1584187292,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fihagv/devs_please_stop_putting_slow_interactive_scenes/,Games,1

I also have many friends at my local hangout that play pokemon and do raids and battles all the time. I know if I don't get back into it and play right now I'm going to be upset that I miss all of that. I also just feel so unmotivated to do anything with that game.

But now we have finished all the halo games that just was point and shoot and was a good learning curve for her. We want to play an other co-op shooter. I was thinking of playing borderlands since I have played it a lot and its my favorite game. But playing borderlands for the first time can be hard because of al the numbers and text and stuff so i dont want to bore her with it because that will make me cry if she didnt like it. My other suggestion was A way out but i dont know how that wil play for her.

fie4zv,russell2937,Dark Souls 2 SOTFS First Playthrough Rant.,"This is all my opinion and I couldn't help but write something up about the game. I'd love to hear some feedback from anyone reading, this is pretty long BTW.

(I wouldn't read this if you haven't played any of the Dark Souls Games, it might be a bit confusing.)

For context, i've played Demons Souls once (great game though), 350 Hours of Dark Souls 1 (including a bow and dagger only playthrough), the first 1/4th of Bloodborne (couldnt afford psnow and only had the 1 week trial), 700 hours of Dark Souls 3, and about half of Sekiro. I think it's safe to say that I am experienced in the other two DS games and I finally decided to play DS2 for the first time. I had tried multiple times in the past but never got to Drangleic Castle, usually stopping at Earthen Peak or Iron Keep. 

The reason why I always stopped is the game just felt wrong to me. It feels floatier, I didn't like that I frames were tied to a stat, I didn't like the linear level design in the sections I had played (specifically Heide's and No Man's Wharf). My opinion on the game was far lower than the other games even though I hadn't beaten it, or even gotten halfway through. After beating it I can still say it's probably my least favorite out of the 4 that i've beaten, but I respect it a lot more and may play it again someday, but here are the things I found to be pretty scuffed.

It seems like the developers missed the original intentions of DS1 of providing an immersive world and showing that the undead curse is a truly awful thing, thus giving the player incentive to push on and link the fire to end it, or to let the flame die out to stop delaying the inevitable. DS2 seems to just want to hammer in the fact that it's hard. Like seriously? The hags in the beginning tell you you will die over and over again, and there is a death counter you will likely find in the first 5 minutes of the game. It's kind of ironic leading into my next paragraph as well.

I found the bosses in this game to be easy, and uninspired. 85 percent of the bosses in this game I beat on the first or second attempt, including Throne Watcher / Defender and Nashandra, who are supposed to be the climax to the game. The only bosses who I think I died to more than twice were Smelter Demon, Velstadt, and Giant Lord (Not the boss himself, I got bombed from the left 3 times after entering the fog gate.) Most of them were very easy, I don't know if the weapon I was using was just extremely good (Shotel +10) or if they are legitimately not very challenging. The amount of bosses that have enemies just copy pasted in to make them more difficult are also pretty disappointing, like the Royal Rat Vanguard and Authority, Duke's Dear Freya, Prowling Magnus / Congregation etc. etc. I played through Demon's Souls recently for the first time and the bosses were more difficult and more memorable for me (the intro cutscene for the penetrator is fucking awesome) The most interesting boss to me was the Looking Glass Knight, when the black phantom smashes through his shield I was surprised and even think I said ""huh?"" it was a cool moment and probably the most memorable part of the game for me.

Levels like Iron Keep, The Gutter, Earthen Peak, and Brightstone Cove are FULL of enemy spam (I don't know if this is better in the non scholar version), not to where it provides a fair challenge, more where it seems like the designers ctrl+v'd a bunch of the same enemy (who are easy on their own) creating sort of artificial difficulty instead of a true challenge, they can overlap attacks and stun you until death if you get hit a single time. Not to mention that they visually don't make sense, Heides is WAY farther from Majula than you actually walk, you ride an invisible elevator up from Earthen Peak to a big lava world in the sky (Iron Keep), Shaded Woods and Aldia's Keep overlap into the same area etc. etc. The part of DS1 I like the most is that the world makes sense, there are tons of paths and shortcuts to get inbetween areas and it feels like a tangible place that could exist, but DS2's level design is nonsensical and almost feels lazy at times.

Some of the enemies bother me as well, like the Heide Knights with untelegraphed attacks that hit HARD at early levels, the Black Old Knight wielding the hammer at the entrance to Dragon Shrine seems to have no stamina or attack cooldown and can chain attack into attack unrelentingly, and how certain enemies and bosses are just so large that the camera cant focus on them properly and give you a good view, although this is an issue in the other games too so i'll let it slide. 

Towards the end of the playthrough, all I wanted to do was finish the game. The other games, I always tried to do 100% of the content on the first time through but with DS2 I just wanted to play the other games by the time I hit Dragon Aerie. It took me 13.5 hours to finish the game and not want to play any more, where as a comparison, I spent 100 hours on my first DS3 character completing all of the content and multiple ng+'s as well as all the PVP I did, while subsequently making a new character and playing it all over again.

I would honestly rather play DS2 over most other games that i've played, but just compared to the other games it seems so lackluster. Comparing something to Dark Souls 1 almost isn't fair, it's a flawed masterpiece in my opinion. I have respect for this game now, and after writing this it seems a bit too harsh but it's how I honestly feel.

My recent one is this gameplay produced by omotea in Beat Saber:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He9l40pkOtw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He9l40pkOtw) 

I've been mass-sharing it because I think it's a really unique video.  Why is it unique?

* The style of play is very unique for BeatSaber by the omotea player (free style dancing while hitting the boxes).  Movements enhance the gameplay watchability.
* The map maker making multiple decorations that also enhance the rhythm gameplay and not limiting to just being obstacles.  I've never seen maps like this!

fi4ajv,ExistentialTenant,Players Beware: Do Not Update Ori Will Of The Wisps,"TLDR: Do not get the 8GB update for Ori Will of the Wisps (WOW). This update deleted my saved file and made the game unplayable.

---

I'm so utterly pissed right now that I can hardly think. I had 10+ hours in the game and now it's gone just like that.

To elaborate, I've been playing Ori Will of the Wisps (WOW) on Xbox Game Pass since its release two days ago and been loving it. In fact, I subscribed solely for this game. I was about 3/4 of the way through the game.

However, the game had been giving me major issues. Audio skips consistently and reloading an autosave after I die is sometimes very slow even resulting in freezes. There are also random lags.

Well, today, I went to play the game and notice a huge 8GB 'update'. I was happy thinking this update might solve the performance issues I was having. I updated right away, of course. 

As the title says, when I opened the game after the update, I was horrified to see my saved file disappeared. I closed and reopened the game multiple times and even did a reinstallation hoping that it was a mistake, but to no avail. It was gone. I looked on the Ori sub and saw some others having the same problem, but there was no solution.

To add insult to injury, the performance issue actually became even worse with the update. Not only did I still see lag even on startup, but the game freezes at the save slot selection screen so that you can't even start a new game. Not that it matters as I'm not replaying all those lost hours.

Thanks a lot, Moon Studios.",12,1584124121,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fi4ajv/players_beware_do_not_update_ori_will_of_the_wisps/,Games,1

fi0xur,Verpous,"We're the developers behind the fast-paced physics shooter, MOTION. After two years, we have just released our game on Steam! Ask us anything!","My name is Aviv Edery. Two years ago, a little after high school, I started working on a game because I had a lot of free time and wanted to gain some experience as a programmer and game designer. After a few months of development, I went looking for people who could do the aspects of game development that I couldn't. Through a game developers' discord server, I met Dahmani Abelmadjid (/u/badidrox), our 3D artist; Serban Matei (/u/WarpedBiotic), our sound designer; and Nicholas Zhuravel (/u/NickciN123), our composer.

We worked on the game in our spare time. When I started the game I was between things and had a lot of time, but then I started University and since then we mainly made progress when I was between semesters. Development was slow, but here we are!

MOTION is a fast-paced physics shooter where you must survive against waves of enemies by throwing explosives and sawblades at them using a gun that lets you grab objects from afar and throw them with force. You can check out our store page here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/919400/MOTION/

fhyfve,AlexCoinman,"Suggest me games from those genres please, gonna have plenty of time to burn because of the coronavirus.","Looking for new games to play, so I need suggestions. I'll give a few details so you know what to suggest.

Genres:

1. Post apocalyptic games (my favorite), don't suggest fallout/metro series, last light, rage 1&amp;2, mad max or farcry new dawn, those are the ones that I already played that come to mind now.
2. FPS games with good storylines, the game's story is very important to me, I don't just want a ""just kill everyone"" game.
3. Sci-fi/ futuristic (did not play as many from this genre, but I liked the Deus Ex series for example)
4. Anything other genre if you think it's good enough to make me like that specific genre

A load of bonus points if the game is open world.

P.S.: No medieval/fantasy games, please, just...no.

Thanks a lot in advance! :)",4,1584100392,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fhyfve/suggest_me_games_from_those_genres_please_gonna/,Games,1

fhqrz5,Emilia_Violet,Psychological horror games for someone with anxiety,"Request: Can anyone recommend some good horror games that are more about the horror of the events and atmosphere than the actual gameplay? 

Elaboration: I have generalized anxiety and, as a result, I've always had trouble with horror. While I can enjoy horror, jumpscares and visual stuff just doesn't work for me. It causes far too much stress and strain, which ruins my enjoyment. I won't even be able to sleep later unless I have someone else there with me, so it's a problem.

That said, I have been getting into horror-ish games for the past year, and was hoping others might be able to point me towards more. Corpse Party was the first one I played and enjoyed. Amnesia was too stressful and I ended up having to quit completely once I got to that damn flooded area. But, I liked the concept enough that I actually ended up reading the rest of the lore stuff online.

I absolutely loved Raging Loop and Worldend Syndrome. The kind of mystery horror that let's the player make choices and explore is a good place to start. This is actually one of the reasons I had hoped to enjoy Amnesia, but things don't always work out.",4,1584059309,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fhqrz5/psychological_horror_games_for_someone_with/,Games,1

fhpen0,falkflyer,"On side quests, pacing, and completionism.","Hey everyone. I've never tried to start a discussion like this before, but it's been on my mind a bunch lately and I'm hoping to get some opinions - and potentially some suggestions. I just finished playing through The Outer Worlds, and while it was a pretty good experience, I found myself getting frustrated towards the end by the same thing that tends to plague most RPGs I've played: pacing. I'd been working on my companion quests in between running around for ""bigger"" missions, but hadn't completed any aside from the vicar's until I ran up against the end game, when it almost literally told me to go finish any other quests before continuing.

Now, I don't strictly take issue with the game being upfront about not being able to turn back, but the problem is when this warning pops up when you're supposed to be going on some time-critical journey to save the star system - &gt;!my home colony's only chance of survival has been kidnapped and is probably about to be killed, but before I do that, I guess I should make sure my ship's engineer gets to go on her date first.!&lt; I've run into this a lot before, where if I'm not completing the main quest objectives, it breaks the immersion and feels like I'm wasting my time while there's this ever-present reminder something important is supposed to be happening. On the flip side, if I just power through the main story line, then I miss out on a ton of the ""real"" game and finish way too quickly.

I guess I'm mostly just complaining at this point, but I was wondering how other people tend to view this - in some games, I've just ignored the main story line, but Outer Worlds makes it tough since you're pretty limited by your progression. Are there examples of games that handle this better? It might have been neat if some of these checkpoints happened after a certain amount of in-game time, rather than conveniently bookending each objective.",17,1584053779,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fhpen0/on_side_quests_pacing_and_completionism/,Games,1

With so many events being cancelled and postponed I feel like this is a little too much of a reality now and for those of us like myself who have Collectors Editions preordered that we've been anxious for, it seems like the worst possible outcome when they're so close.

fhl9g6,DrSeafood,The threat of lost progress and repetition,"What happens when you get Game Over? You start again at the beginning of the level, or at the most recent checkpoint. We've all got to the last phase of a boss fight, only to die in the final seconds and think ""Aw fuck, now I have to restart all the way from the beginning.""

The threat of losing progress or repeating tasks can *motivate* the player to improve and succeed. Think about Dark Souls and how you respawn all the way at the last bonfire --- everyone hates that ""walk of shame"" back to the boss arena. You have this legitimate threat of *wasted IRL time* constantly looming over your head, making every failed dodge roll hurt even more. I think this is a very effective way to make combat feel weighty and impactful.

When you remove this threat, it can really make the game feel meaningless. For example, I used to play Mega Man on an emulator, and I abused the shit out save states. In fact, I had my finger hovering over F2 to quick-reload every time I took a hit. I think this really diminished the learning curve and feedback loop that the game has to offer, so I absolutely did not enjoy the game as much as I could have. There's a balance: frequent checkpoints makes the game boring, but too few checkpoints can make things frustrating. For example, it can help to have frequent checkpoints in a game like Celeste (where you die in literally one hit every 10-15 seconds). Imagine if Celeste had Dark Souls bonfires --- nobody would play it.

Repetition can also *demotivate* the player from trying new things. ""I want to try my new fireball attack here, but if it doesn't work then I'm gonna have to go all the way back to the last bonfire, so forget it.""

I'm interested in the following questions.

* What games do *not* use repetition and lost progress as a form of punishment? (I'm thinking primarily of action/adventure games, not DDR or Solitaire obviously, but I'm open to any interesting examples.)
* When can the threat of lost progress result in a satisfying challenge? When is it too frustrating? Examples?",22,1584038676,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fhl9g6/the_threat_of_lost_progress_and_repetition/,Games,1

It’s exactly 99,98€.

The problem is that the product cannot be purchased because of geographical restrictions. I found out that these products are for Germany and Austria only apparently. 

I tried VPN, changing address on Amazon to somewhere in Germany (even though it’s a digital product) but nothing worked so far. Maybe I used wrong VPN or did something wrong.

fhhw1t,iamisom,Ninja Gaiden has been out for about 31 years. What are your first impressions?,"Ninja Gaiden, known as *Shadow Warriors* in Europe and *Ninja Ryukenden* in Japan, is a platformer game for the Nintendo Entertainment System developed by Tecmo. Originally released in Japan towards the end of 1988, it was the first in a popular trilogy of Ninja Gaiden titles for the NES featuring the adventures of Ryu Hayabusa.

The game is renowned for its innovative use of cinematic cutscenes. It represents one of the first NES games to feature a full, movie-like story. The game's success spawned two sequels and several ports to other video game systems.

**Now that we've had 31 years to try this game out and not just a single day, what did you think?**",18,1584026199,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fhhw1t/ninja_gaiden_has_been_out_for_about_31_years_what/,Games,1

fhh5yx,johnsciarrino,"My group of friends is bored with all the games we play, what's a new game we can play together online?","We're a group of IRL friends who play online together often. Ten dudes and a total mixed bag of what we like to play. At any given times, the group will split up to jump in for online play in a range of different games; Four of us turned into a heist group in GTA Online and have played everything that game has to offer. Borderlands 3 held our attention for a while. FIFA used to be a go-to until they killed many of the online game modes that allowed 2v2 or 1v2 with everyone on their own Xbox (now the only way to have a guest player on your team is by having them physically play on the same screen as you) so our interested died. Rocket League remains a staple of the group but, at this point, it's pretty much the only one. 

So, /r/games, what would you recommend for a group of 30 somethings might like to play together?",5,1584023306,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fhh5yx/my_group_of_friends_is_bored_with_all_the_games/,Games,1

fhgpfh,martydolan,"Tarantino's World: Comparing ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" to Modern-Day Adventure Gaming","After rewatching Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” I recognized a few parallels between it and modern-day adventure games - or walking simulators. A so-called “hanging-out” movie, “Hollywood” messes around with audience expectations of what the plot should be, and instead treats the atmosphere of ‘69 LA as (debatably) the most important aspect of the film. I thought this was an interesting strategy, and one that seemed to mimic in a lot of ways the minimalist and atmospheric storytelling styles of modern adventure games like “Firewatch.” Between the shared element of atmosphere and the emphasis on the downtime of the characters, I decided to do a write up for my blog.

[Here’s the link:](https://airquotesinfo.data.blog/2020/03/12/tarantinos-world-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-and-the-walking-simulator/)

But why doesn't this happen with enemy AI the same way? I expected the best AI from last year to be topped by this year's AI. If you compare graphics from a game 5/6 years ago, every single aspect of the graphics between games will be better. But you can have some games from 2013 that have better AI than some games releasing nowadays. How is this possible? Has game AI not developed very much over the last few years?

""Never play on patch day"" applied here as well, from what I can gather, but what about the gameplay itself when you get into a match? Some things I would find particularly interesting would be:

* How's the TTK?
* How's the map?
* How are the ""defining features"" of the mode? (The gulag, 150 players, the buy stations, loadout drops etc.)
* Does cross-play make things feel unbalanced in either direction?
* How are the basics compared to the competitors? (Looting, movement, resource management etc,)
* How are the systems which seem 'strongly inspired' by the competitors? (pinging system, respawn system, weapons in tiers rather than attachments etc.)

fh0393,TheyKeepOnRising,Why exclusivity is often good: An experienced explanation about how competition drives quality,"There's been a lot of discussion about game exclusivity recently with the news of Horizon: Zero Dawn coming to PC. Instead of replying in a comment that is surely to be buried, I figured I'd make a quick post to explain why exclusivity is good when it is done correctly.

TL;DR: Horizon: Zero Dawn coming to PC is a very good thing and gamers should be happy. However Horizon: Zero Dawn being an exclusive in the first place was also a very good thing.

Exclusivity is a form of competition, and competition (when done right) is the best driving force behind quality products. This is why so many iconic franchises have been exclusives, such as Mario, Zelda, Halo, Uncharted, GoW, and formerly Sonic and Crash Bandicoot. New entries to these franchises are often given massive financial support from their platform, and their work environments are focused around passionate development and cultivating new ideas. Each new mainline Mario game directly represents its respective console, so Nintendo ensures the game's quality with rigorous testing and an often leisurely development cycle.

Meanwhile you have your cross-platform titles, which are often concerned with being ""mostly playable"" at release and optimizing monetization practices. These are your Call of Duties, Assassin Creeds, Anthems, various sports games, and other countless titles often with an annual release date. These games have strict, hellish development cycles and ridiculous employee turnover. Bug-ridden launches and day 1 patches with very few innovations or advancements to their formulas. These are not guaranteed BAD games, but never GREAT games either and often forgettable.

Keep in mind that there are ALWAYS exceptions and qualifiers to what I've said above. Halo 5 is proof that exclusives are not always good, and there are tons of AA and indie games that are cross platform and undoubtedly great games. Smaller studious have a natural competition against the giants, and this drives a requirement for a top quality game to survive in the marketplace.

So if I think that exclusivity is good, why do I think the Horizon: Zero Dawn release to PC is also good? This is because the usefulness of the exclusivity for the stakeholder (in this case Sony) is limited by the length of the sales benefit, meaning how many new players are introduced to the Playstation platform. HZD has been out for quite a while, and there are very few customers who are actively buying new Playstations just to play HZD. However there are many potential customers on other platforms who can not only buy the game and boost profits direct sales, but have a taste of what Playstation offers to its players right before the release of Playstation 5. Its a brilliant sales tactic, quite honestly.

I have many more insights on other aspects of this topic, such as Epic Games or Microsoft's push to PC, but I will only share if there is interest for the sake of this already lengthy post.",10,1583944938,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fh0393/why_exclusivity_is_often_good_an_experienced/,Games,0

fgxonk,SumWon269,It's a shame there isn't a video game based on the Castlevania anime.,"Konami used to be a major gaming company. They had so many games people loved. All they seem to make now is arcade and mobile games, supposedly because they're easy money. 

Now they're so incompetent they haven't made a single game to take advantage of their property having 3 seasons of anime. They're so creatively bankrupt they can't even act on a chance to invest it in themselves, make money and gain favor with fans while their property has more interest in it than it has in years.

It's actually kind of pathetic.

I’m curious to see what kind of responses people would have, besides the “give me $40 for my 1 year old game” obviously trade values must be low enough that GameStop can hold on to extra stock and not lose money on selling it or if they end up holding on to it for a while and the game deprecates. 

People aren’t happy about how employees are forced to tell you lengthy promotions, what would you recommend to counter this point.

fguuk1,Mechaghostman2,Wii U vs. Switch: Some Specs,"Wii U specs:

CPU: PowerPC 7500 CL  
1.24 ghz  
'unknown IPC, most likely less than the Switch'  
3 cores

GPU: AMD Radeon ""Latte""  
75 gb/s IPC  
550 mhz  
400 shaders

Ram: DDR3  
2 gb  
12.8 gb/s IPC  
'unknown clock speed' - DDR3 is usually 100 mhz - 266 mhz

Switch specs:

CPU: Tegra X1  
1.02 ghz  
25.6 gb/s IPC  
4 cores

GPU: Tegra X1  
25.6 gb/s IPC  
768 mhz  
256 shaders

Ram: LPDDR4  
4 GB  
25.6 gb/s IPC  
1600 mhz

The clock speed of the two processors are comparable, but clock speed isn't everything. The Switch, using a shared memory bus, has a consistent 25.6 gb/s bandwidth for both the CPU and GPU, and ram too apparently. The Wii U, on the other hand, is impossible to find info on the bandwidth for its CPU. Devs complained it was slow while some bloggers boasted about its theoretical superiority to the 360/PS3. The problem was it was using a PowerPC 7500 CL, an outdated type of CPU architecture that devs didn't want to work with. It only used 3 cores, and judging by how poorly it performed with some ports, I'd argue that its slower than the PS3/360.

The GPU in the two are another story, however. At the current bandwidth, the Switch's GPU would have to be clocked at 1,650 mhz to be on par with the GPU of the Wii U. That said, the Switch's GPU is more modern, allowing it to do things with less power than the one in the Wii U could.

The ram speed is another thing that really hit the Wii U. The Switch's ram speed is similar to that of a 360 or PS3, while the Wii U's ram was half that.

The Wii U tried to compete graphically with the PS3/360, and while its GPU was superior, its CPU and ram weren't.

The Switch, on the other hand, outperforms the 7th gen consoles and the Wii U in real world tests. It will very often render at a higher resolution than what the 7th gen and Wii U did. Sometimes it'll have some slow downs, especially when docked and running in 1080p (honestly I wish they gave us the option to keep it at 720p when docked), but generally its a better platform than the 7th gen and Wii U consoles.

Plus, it's a handheld. A handheld that can output its A/V signal to a TV and use wireless controllers, as many tablets can, but still a handheld. So it gets away with being less powerful than the PS4 and XBone.",9,1583921541,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fguuk1/wii_u_vs_switch_some_specs/,Games,1

DAE your the Demon to Demons?) while Eternal has done a complete 180 with a greater focus on story and cutscenes. 


The 2nd biggest narrative was how great it was to return to oldschool shooters -- just fast paced, boots on the ground gameplay. well now, in Doom Eternal you have a grapplehook and a jet pack that has people boosting around like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare(check the gameplay). 



It's still going to be fun but i guaran-damn-tee that the narrative for Doom:Eternal is going to be: ""DAE Eternal is a good game but just not a good Doom game?""

**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Jordan Devore](https://opencritic.com/critic/432/jordan-devore) - [9 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-nioh-2-582534.phtml)

&gt;If there's one point I want to get across above all others, it's this: Nioh 2 isn't as revelatory as the first game, but that shouldn't be held as a mark against it – at least not this time. Team Ninja was right to iterate and expand carefully. Nioh got so much right on the first go. While the new prequel storyline suffers from a slow and disconnected start, just about every other aspect of Nioh 2 feels upgraded.

-------------

**[EGM](https://opencritic.com/outlet/38/egm)** - [Mollie L Patterson](https://opencritic.com/critic/167/mollie-l-patterson) - [8 / 10](https://egmnow.com/nioh-2-review/)

&gt;Nioh 2 takes the ideas of its predecessor and greatly expands on them, bringing a greater sense of depth to everything from gameplay, to stage design, to your ability to have a main character customized to your particular play style (and visual preferences). Admittedly, some of the simpler elegance of the original Nioh has been lost in the progress, but the result is still a game that'll terrorize and thrill those looking for a real challenge.

&gt;An absorbing, tense and well-wrought samurai adventure let down by a little too much recycling and some muddled new systems.

**[Fextralife](https://opencritic.com/outlet/501/fextralife)** - Fexelea - [9.7 / 10](https://fextralife.com/nioh-2-review-practically-perfect/)

&gt;Nioh 2 is a beautiful, polished and addicting ARPG seamlessly melding character optimization with action-packed moments, and elevating them with excellent level and enemy designs. Nioh 2 will challenge you to be better and keep you coming back for more, while allowing you to co-op your way through the hardest portions of the game. ARPG fans will want to buy this day one and enjoy the multiplayer wave at its finest.

&gt;Offering a host of bosses to battle, challenges to overcome, and massive customization opportunities, Nioh 2 is a tantalizing treat for those with a thirst for serious and sometimes frustrating adversity

&gt;Nioh 2 is a great action RPG game, with a lot of content, a good gameplay and a nice artistic direction. The game doesn't have any major default'and is quite amazing !

-------------

**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/nioh-2-review/)

&gt;Nioh 2 might play it safe in some respects, but the fluidity, depth and intensity of its combat is incredible.

-------------

**[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer)** - [Adam Beck](https://opencritic.com/critic/873/adam-beck) - [4 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&amp;p=369129)

&gt;Nioh 2 is a great game that's obscured beneath a mountain of frustration.

-------------

**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Mitchell Saltzman](https://opencritic.com/critic/621/mitchell-saltzman) - [9 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-2-review)

&gt;Nioh 2's many systems may be a little overwhelming, but the stellar combat and satisfying difficulty make it worth it.

-------------

**[PSX Brasil](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil)** - [Bruno Henrique Vinhadel](https://opencritic.com/critic/3869/bruno-henrique-vinhadel) - *Portuguese* - [85 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/analises/analise-nioh-2/)

&gt;Nioh 2 brings back brutal and challenging combat along with yet another fantastic feudal Japan setting. The variety in gameplay remains one of the game's greatest assets. Fun and challenge go hand in hand here, even though the title still needs some balancing. Small defects as in the development of the story and in the boss fights are notable, but they don't affect the excellent experience that the game provides.

-------------

**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Garri Bagdasarov](https://opencritic.com/critic/840/garri-bagdasarov) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/nioh-2-ps4-review/)

&gt;Masterfully crafted and executed, Nioh 2 sets the benchmark for action/adventure games that people just have to experience. Team Ninja's latest provides one of the most in-depth combat systems and an addictive loot system that may put all but the best dungeon crawlers to shame. It's quite simple, Nioh 2 has Game of the Year written all over it.

-------------

**[PowerUp!](https://opencritic.com/outlet/577/powerup-)** - [Adam Mathew](https://opencritic.com/critic/4125/adam-mathew) - [8.5 / 10](https://powerup-gaming.com/2020/03/11/nioh-2-review-ps4-not-as-sharp-as-it-could-be-still-cuts-deep%ef%bb%bf/)

&gt;Bottom line; this isn’t a huge reinvention, but it sure is a damn solid sequel.

-------------

**[RPG Site](https://opencritic.com/outlet/322/rpg-site)** - [Lucas Rivarola](https://opencritic.com/critic/6007/lucas-rivarola) - [9 / 10](http://www.rpgsite.net/review/9524-nioh-2-review)

&gt;Building upon what made the first one such a great game, Nioh 2 is an amazing sequel.

-------------

**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [Sam Chandler](https://opencritic.com/critic/2622/sam-chandler) - [8 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/116784/nioh-2-review-crouching-yokai-hidden-samurai)

&gt;Though it does sag with some questionable hitboxes and a glut of menus, mastering the interlacing combat systems in Nioh 2 is deeply rewarding. The developers at Team Ninja have crafted a deviously challenging experience that is bound to test even the best of players.

-------------

**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8.5 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2020/3/10/reviews/118456/)

&gt;Nioh 2 is going to be compared to Sekiro, but it is its own beast. It's an excellent follow-up to the original game, and it isn't any lesser for being compared to FromSoft's attempt at the samurai Soulsborne genre. The new features help keep the smooth gameplay feeling intense and exciting, and the various tweaks do wonders for keeping the game fresh. Its biggest flaw is being ""more of the same,"" but the original game was fun enough that a fresh new set of enemies and items is worth a lot. Just be prepared to die a lot. A whole lot. As in, ""I saw multiple corpses by the first enemy of the game.""",435,1583878256,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fgm50t/nioh_2_review_thread/,Games,1

fgldvt,harbinger1945,Bungie is killing it´s own franchise(destiny),"I am not sure if this is allowed to be posted here..but I will do anyway.

So you all remember last year, when Bungie has decided to break apart from Activision. A lot of people expected it to be a great step forward for Bungie and overall indie industry.  
A lot of critism that went in destiny´s direction was somehow steered towards Activision that has a bad reputation(for good reason) - and people expected it to get better after the split.  
What is surprising is the fact that it really didn´t. Bungie lost help to High Moon Studios and Vicarius Visions who made one of the best content drops in destiny´s history(Season of opulence, black armory).

Year 3 of Destiny is IMO a failure for various reasons, but with release of latest season I am confident enough to tell you that Activision wasn´t the one greedy..or at least the only one who was greedy.

The Eververse Store 

The eververse store is basically a store where you buy cosmetic items for real money(in this case currency called silver)  
The eververse store that exist in destiny since destiny 1 was introduced back in the day to finance existence of ""live team""..which we don´t even know if it exists at this point, and later it was said that it finances future content in destiny.

While that might be true(we don´t have any real data to prove or disprove that claim), the evidence is clear that practises that bungie employed after the split got more predatory. Personally I would even say that activision held bungie in check(I know this is hard to believe).

So back in the day bungie introduced something called ""The tribute hall"" where people that play destiny had access to their own private spot in the universe where they could test guns, access vault and stuff like that.

Well it had this mechanic that you had to spend an insane amount of bright dust(a free currency that is used in eververse store) just to get a few statues in this private place so you could access the catalyst for that season´s exotic weapon. You didn´t have to do it of course

The entire thing was basically a scam so people would lose their bright dust stocks.

Shadowkeep

The Shadowkeep expansion relases for 40 EUR. Not only that this thing has a content on level of say season of opulence(with slightly bigger raid), but it is tied with a the most boring season to date, with literally nothing to do outside of incredibly grindy quests that add nothing to the game.  
If that expansions didn´t have raid and dungeon, people would literally refund the game on the spot. Personally I think that current shadowkeep´s rating of 36% on steam speak about itself.  
The biggest and worst change of shadowkeep is in its own eververse store. You no longer get free engrams(cosmetic loot) for leveling up, instead majority of new cosmetic stuff is locked behind paid currency and what is free is extremely expensive(some emotes cost more than you can earn in week).

Bungie at this point in time has decided to break apart their content and time-gate it so people wouldn´t finish the stuff they made a in a week. What is funny is the fact that it doesn´t take a week to finish it but maybe a 6 hours.

Next season is kind of okay, a lot of things get nerfed for various reasons. It´s also the most buggy season yet(there were like 20 game-breaking bugs - and some exotics are not available now after 2 months).

Eververse is the same, even though countless amount of people have made solutions to the problem on reddit/forums/twitter. Bungie completely ignores this.

Today came lastest season I and I had finally enough. Not only the content came with it is pretty bare-bone(i seriously had it done in 20 minutes) but eververse is even more predatory than ever. There are old items sold for paid currency that rotates on daily basis. The new cosmetic items are the ONLY new cosmetic items addded to the game outside like 2 items in ""old"" pinnacle activity that bungie has introduced into the game.

So to conclude: Bungie continues in the path that activision set-up for them - where they don´t care about customers, but about profit. I honestly feel like destiny is at this point more of a mobile game that says it´s a PC game rather than a PC game that has features that are common in mobile games.",22,1583875504,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fgldvt/bungie_is_killing_its_own_franchisedestiny/,Games,1

It's a very unstable game.

It's a damn shame since I think this is From's best game, and probably my favorite exclusive to the platform. I want to be replaying it more, but I can't help but feel it's so limited by its hardware that I'm aggravated at what's on my display.

Bloodborne would not exist without Sony funding it. Recently they've recognized that a lot of people would pay for their titles on PC.

fgf7qg,tea6man9,Horizon Zero Dawn Officially Confirmed for PC with a Release of Summer 2020,"[Via PlayStation Blog](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/03/10/hermen-hulst-qa-interview-with-head-of-playstations-worldwide-studios/):

Our talk covers a lot of ground: from upcoming film and TV projects based on Uncharted and The Last of Us, to the upcoming PC port of Horizon: Zero Dawn, to what’s next for PlayStation’s international network of game studios.

...

PSB: Speaking of experimentation, there have been rumors of a Horizon Zero Dawn complete edition that might be coming to PC… can you confirm or deny that?
HH: Yes, I can confirm that Horizon Zero Dawn is coming to PC this summer…. There will be more information coming from Guerrilla, from the new studio directors [Michiel van der Leeuw, JB van Beek, and Angie Smets] pretty soon.

PSB: PlayStation is no stranger to publishing titles on the PC, but Horizon: Zero Dawn is one of the largest games to make that leap. Is there anything you would say to PlayStation fans? What does it mean for the future?
HH: Sure. I think it’s important that we stay open to new ideas of how to introduce more people to PlayStation, and show people maybe what they’ve been missing out on.

And to maybe put a few minds at ease, releasing one first-party AAA title to PC doesn’t necessarily mean that every game now will come to PC. In my mind, Horizon Zero Dawn was just a great fit in this particular instance. We don’t have plans for day and date [PC releases], and we remain 100% committed to dedicated hardware.",1467,1583852790,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fgf7qg/horizon_zero_dawn_officially_confirmed_for_pc/,Games,1

fges0a,sabreselassie,Looking for an old game where you could have people tread grapes,"So this is a weak and weird explanation: 
I remember playing a game as a kid where you build a village. This was probably in the 90s or early 2000. The ONLY thing I remember is that among other things you could have buildings (the building might have looked like a big bowl or bucket but I really don’t remember) where the workers could tread grapes and then making it into wine. I’m pretty sure it was some kind of strategic game but I don’t think it was Age of Empires, but then again, not sure. Was it possible to do this in AoE? 

I know the explanation is really vague but I really want to find out what game it was. I remember that I loved it.

**[3DNews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/531/3dnews)** - [Денис Щенников](https://opencritic.com/critic/4050/-) - *Russian* - [10 / 10](https://3dnews.ru/1005586)

&gt;Ori and the Blind Forest was an outstanding masterpiece. Ori and the Will of Wisps is even better. It's a shame that bugs ruin overall great experience. Hope they will be fixed by the day one update.

-------------

**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW7gNODEtKk)

&gt;""An amazing sequel to an already enjoyable game that somehow turns the original a bit on its head and comes out with something fantastic.""

-------------

**[AusGamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/30/ausgamers)** - KostaAndreadis - [9 / 10](http://www.ausgamers.com/games/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps/review/)

&gt;An experience where you begin to question if such a traversal move is possible, can it be done &amp;#x2013; is that really the way forward? The answer is almost always yes, and in this regard the sheer speed, fluidity, and scope of Ori's fundamental movement &amp;#x2013; that is moving the analogue stick so the glow-y spirit thing can do its thing &amp;#x2013; is phenomenal.

-------------

**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Gabriel Bogdan](https://opencritic.com/critic/3388/gabriel-bogdan) - *German* - [9.1 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review-emotionale-achterbahnfahrt-mit-einigen-spielerischen-ueberraschungen/)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps is probably the most beautiful Xbox One exclusive game so far and offers, thanks to a lot of well made gameplay adjustments a lot of new ways for players to experience and explore this amazing emotional adventure. Even when the NPCs of the world don't really make a big impact and the game suffered from some bugs and loading issues before Day One, every Xbox One/PC owner should definitely get this game.

-------------

**[Critical Hit](https://opencritic.com/outlet/299/critical-hit)** - [Brad Lang](https://opencritic.com/critic/5914/brad-lang) - [9 / 10](https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review-in-progress/)

&gt;So far, Ori and the Will of the Wisps has taken my breath away. It's possibly one of the most aesthetically gorgeous games I've ever played, even if some parts do feel like they've been ripped straight from the first game and the soundtrack is masterful in every sense of the word.

-------------

**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-582480.phtml)

&gt;With the need to go bigger, Ori and the Will of the Wisps loses some of the simplicity and innocence of the original game, but it steps up in turn with bite and refinement. It's the perfect companion to Ori and the Blind Forest, and is an early defining moment of the decade to come.

-------------

**[EGM](https://opencritic.com/outlet/38/egm)** - [Michael Goroff](https://opencritic.com/critic/4103/michael-goroff) - [8 / 10](https://egmnow.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review/)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines The Blind Forest's mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with ""emotional platformers,"" Will of the Wisps doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience.

-------------

**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Marco Mottura](https://opencritic.com/critic/3505/marco-mottura) - *Italian* - [9 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-nuova-esclusiva-microsoft-47663.html)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the worthy sequel of one of the best games ever published on Xbox One: a stellar return by Moon Studios, one that confirms the talent of a very unique software house. Too bad for some technical flaws and for a code that appears to be a lot less polished than expected: even as it is Will of the Wisps remains a game that's impossible to miss, stating once again the importance and the diversity of this franchise inside the Xbox galaxy.

-------------

**[Game Informer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer)** - [Andrew Reiner](https://opencritic.com/critic/1030/andrew-reiner) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review-even-better-than-the)

&gt;Better than its predecessor and a little longer, Will of the Wisps pounds out excitement at every turn

-------------

**[Gamer Guides](https://opencritic.com/outlet/733/gamer-guides)** - [Ben Chard](https://opencritic.com/critic/5325/ben-chard) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamerguides.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps/review)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a masterpiece in every single way. A thought provoking storyline, unbelievable music and plenty of customization. This is Ori bigger and better in every single way and a strong contender for game of the generation.

-------------

**[Gamerheadquarters](https://opencritic.com/outlet/337/gamerheadquarters)** - [Jason Stettner](https://opencritic.com/critic/2141/jason-stettner) - [8 / 10](https://gamerheadquarters.com/articles/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review.html)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps would be a masterpiece of an experience; one that you could describe as a perfect example of a game as art, held back by some technical issues.

-------------

**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Austin Wood](https://opencritic.com/critic/1121/austin-wood) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review/)

&gt;A gorgeous, tear-jerking platformer which improves on absolutely everything in the first game and ranks among the finest Metroidvanias available today.

-------------

**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Shubhankar Parijat](https://opencritic.com/critic/1198/shubhankar-parijat) - [10 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review-metroidvania-masterpiece)

&gt;With Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Moon Studios have realized the full potential of their debut title, and entered the upper echelons of Metroidvania history.

**[God is a Geek](https://opencritic.com/outlet/111/god-is-a-geek)** - [Chris Hyde](https://opencritic.com/critic/42/chris-hyde) - [9 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review/)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a fantastic sequel. It builds on the original with a few new ideas to deliver a complete experience.

-------------

**[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer)** - [Jordan Helm](https://opencritic.com/critic/890/jordan-helm) - [5 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/2020/03/10/review-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps/368994/)

&gt;There are times when you feel obliged to find faults no matter how minor, but in the ten-plus hours spent with Moon Studios' latest, there are none.

-------------

**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - [Rafael Aznar](https://opencritic.com/critic/3790/rafael-aznar) - *Spanish* - [Unscored](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-ori-and-will-wisps-xbox-one-pc-596801)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a metroidvania like no other. It is beautiful, emotional, fun, varied, intense… Moon Studios has taken the formula of the first game and has evolved it in the right way. However, it has some critical issues, so we will wait for the day 1 patch to consider the score.

-------------

**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Brandin Tyrrel](https://opencritic.com/critic/206/brandin-tyrrel) - [9 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.

-------------

**[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - *Italian* - [9.3 / 10](https://it.ign.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-pc/167059/review/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-la-recensione)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps is one of the best game of this generation, thanks to a compelling story, a brand new combat system and a great variety of contents that make it an amazing successor to Moon Studios' interpretation of the metroidvania genre.

-------------

**[PC Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/162/pc-gamer)** - [Tyler Wilde](https://opencritic.com/critic/709/tyler-wilde) - [81 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review/)

&gt;It's inconsistent and sometimes annoying, but ultimately a charming, challenging, heart-string-pulling fable.

-------------

**[PCGamesN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/169/pcgamesn)** - [Phil Iwaniuk](https://opencritic.com/critic/722/phil-iwaniuk) - [7 / 10](https://www.pcgamesn.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps/review)

&gt;A haunting journey through a woodland with a real sense of place, but its breadth of mechanics silts up the pacing. Phil Iwaniuk

&gt;While Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a sequel that'll challenge your resolve and temper your spirit at times, its final act will fill your heart and have it bursting with joie de vivre.

&gt;“More than a mere sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps innovates and excels in creating a bigger and bolder adventure in every way imaginable.”

-------------

**[Rock, Paper, Shotgun](https://opencritic.com/outlet/270/rock-paper-shotgun)** - [Cian Maher](https://opencritic.com/critic/5862/cian-maher) - [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/03/10/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-pc-review/)

&gt;Presuming these techy mishaps are rectified, Ori And The Will Of The Wisps is one of the most charming, engaging, visually striking and emotionally touching games I’ve played in a long time. It’s difficult but fair, complex but intuitive, and gruelling but conquerable.

-------------

**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [Chris Jarrard](https://opencritic.com/critic/4311/chris-jarrard) - [8 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/116810/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review-a-great-sugar-glider-rat-rabbit-cat-game)

&gt;We are living in the golden age of metroidvanias and Will of the Wisps will deserve to stand with the best of the bunch should its technical shortcomings be resolved.

-------------

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps comes close to being the perfect sequel. With greatly improved combat, an endearing story book vibe and jaw-dropping platforming spectacles, Will of the Wisps has the potential to become one of the best titles in the Xbox's first-party library. Unfortunately, there are so many technical issues on the Xbox One S right now that it’s difficult to recommend.

-------------

**[Twinfinite](https://opencritic.com/outlet/21/twinfinite)** - [Chris Jecks](https://opencritic.com/critic/92/chris-jecks) - [Unscored](https://twinfinite.net/2020/03/wheres-our-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review/)

&gt;The game blends calm with its stunning backdrop, cute characters, and heartfelt story of friendship and selflessness with chaos thanks to sudden chase sequences that have you sprinting across the screen in a test of your platforming prowess.
&gt;
&gt;We’ll have our full review published just as soon as I’ve sat down with Ori and the Will of the Wisps’ updates that focus on improving performance and resolving technical issues.

&gt;Ori and the Will of Wisps is a truly delightful and devastating game that blends new ideas into a solid foundation, all topped off with an incredible score and even more breathtaking levels to explore.

-------------

**[Windows Central](https://opencritic.com/outlet/515/windows-central)** - [Jez Corden](https://opencritic.com/critic/4653/jez-corden) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.windowscentral.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps triumphs despite some rough edges, with what might be the most satisfying and evocative platformer ever made.

-------------

**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [9 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2020/3/10/reviews/118454/)

&gt;Ori and the Will of the Wisps is bigger and more polished than the original title. I can't recommend playing it before the original, if only because the plot relies on you having played the first game. Otherwise, this is an absolute must-play for fans of the genre. Some minor quibbles and a few annoying bugs hold it back, but hopefully, those will be addressed by the day-one patch. If you've been waiting for Will of the Wisps, you'll be extremely pleased.

fgatko,PM_Me_Handsome_Lads,I buy indie games twice. Sometimes 3 times. And you should too.,"It's rare enough that I find games I truly enjoy, so when I do I wanna support the people who made them. When a good indie game is released on several consoles/store fronts, I will buy it again and again. I will even buy the soundtrack on top of that. I did so with games like Hollow Knight, Owlboy and West of Loathing. I feel these games were easily worth twice to triple the amount of their selling price. 

I got The Messenger and Gato Roboto for free (because Devolver Digital hands out free keys like candy and bless them for it) and enjoyed the games so much I bought them again on Switch just to show my appreciation for the effort, blood, sweat and tears that must have been poured into making games as polished as these.

It's in your own best interest to throw money at those who make the kind entertainment you enjoy. More money = More games like that.

I may be looking at this from a particularly empathetic angle, I work in the indie comics scene and I know how many fucking hours it takes to complete even the smallest of projects. I really do think indie games are too damn cheap for the amount of work that goes into them. Steam sale madness and free to play has spoiled us into thinking games aren't worth more. This may be the case for big budget games (I frankly have no clue how the pricing would work on such a scale.) but if we're talking about games being developed by a handful of people, maybe even just a single person... We're talking about being broke and working two different jobs in a one-room apartment, spending what few hours remain of the day on your passion project before you collapse from exhaustion. 10, 20 or even 30 bucks does not seem like such a high asking price to me.

&amp;#x200B;

ffugmr,rattlesnake_906,EA Patents Non-Linear Battle Pass-Like Reward System,"Electronic Arts (EA) will be changing the way seasonal rewards are distributed among players in games or so does a recently filed trademark suggest.

Currently, the publishing giant as well as other publishers outline a single linear path for players to follow. Taking a battle pass as an example, players have to make progress towards the first level (or node) before unlocking the attached reward and then immediately progressing towards the next level or node. What EA is considering right now is to give players more options so that they can choose their own path for their own rewards.

According the abstract of the patent, an entire virtual map will be set before the players. The non-linear design will mean that players must decide between multiple paths for their respective rewards. In other words, there will be junctions set at certain points by EA where players can turn either left or right, or keeping going forward. Each path will have a unique set of rewards. Hence, players can either move through the shortest route for pre-sighted rewards or backtrack and complete the entire map for a clean run.

ffu8wl,1ntervention,Are their still people who are able to play or hav interest in the pokemon-like mobile game Dragon Island Blue released in 2011 (first game of the company behind Neo Monsters),"Hello,

currently I am asking in multiple subreddits about the game Dragon Island Blue.  
It´s one if not my favorite mobile game there is but sadly it isn´t aviable anymore and it only works on old IOS devices. Luckily I managed to set up and old Iphone and I am still able to play it. I don´t want to to in depth about the game mechanics (but you can look it up) but I am sure some will recognize or miss the game. It had wonderful monster sprites (with a medieval touch) and i don´t want this game to be forgotten.

I created a subreddit called r/DragonIslandBlue and I am trying to get as many members I can.  
There you can ask some question about the game or share footage of it.  
I would be happy about everyone who joins.",1,1583758646,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/ffu8wl/are_their_still_people_who_are_able_to_play_or/,Games,1

In fact, my wife of 20 years knows them all and will even use them.

ffjtnb,DrSeafood,Failure as a narrative device,"Failure is a useful narrative device: it can be used to emphasize a rivalry, get you to learn from your mistakes, or to make an antagonist seem more menacing. A simple example is from **Sekiro**: you're intended to lose the first fight with Genichiro; indeed the rivalry with Genichiro is an important plot point. One thing I like about this example is that you fight Genichiro several times over the course of the game, and each time is a new test of your technical skills.

Another example is from **Metal Gear Solid 2** when you first fight Fortune. Her invincibility is shown in a previous scene, so when you encounter her later she seems a lot more menacing. But instead of merely telling you ""Fortune is immune to bullets lol"", they actually get you to try to fight her in a true boss fight capacity, forcing you to realize that your weapons are futile. Ultimately, the ""wow Raiden can't beat her"" effect is replaced by ""wow ***I*** can't beat her"". This is pretty much ""show don't tell"" at its best.

For an example where failure is used poorly, my mind immediately jumps to JRPGs. Many games lead you to fight until the boss has only a quarter of his health left, then it cuts to a cinematic showing your character getting wrecked. Even if you were doing really well in the fight, the cinematic shows you losing and *forces* failure on you in an inorganic way. It does not serve the purpose of making the boss seem menacing. Compare this to Genichiro, where you actually *can* win the first fight if you're good enough (or playing NG+).

\---

* What are your favorite examples of failure as a narrative device?
* What are some examples where it is used poorly?
* What are some examples where it's not used, but *could* have been used to make the scene more impactful?",466,1583704205,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/ffjtnb/failure_as_a_narrative_device/,Games,1

&amp;#x200B;

The two I like the most was the original Gears of War commercial with REM's Mad World and The dishonored trailer with gold dust woman.  That is an excellent cover by whoever copilot actually had mix it sing it.

ffdxs5,HuzaifahHD,What are some of the best examples of Collectible placements that make sense in their respective game worlds?,"I've been playing through both Watch Dogs 2 and Sleeping Dogs these past few days, and one of the most jarring things I've noticed about both these games is the placement of the Collectibles in them.

In Watch Dogs 2, there are literally just Modems and USB devices scattered across rooftops and hidden in air vents, and just brown paper bags filled with cash littered around benches, construction sites and the like.

Similarly in Sleeping Dogs, there are just lockboxes of money scattered across the streets and roofs of Hong Kong, and ancient Jade Statues just placed almost randomly on barges, in nightclubs and in kitchens.

So my question is: what are some of the best examples of Collectibles that make sense within their environments, and don't just seem randomly dotted around maps like modems in air vents?

(One good example of Collectibles that make sense thematically to me are Cave Paintings in Far Cry Primal)",287,1583680925,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/ffdxs5/what_are_some_of_the_best_examples_of_collectible/,Games,1

Use this thread to discuss whatever game you've been playing lately: old or new, AAA or indie, on any platform between Atari and XBox. Please don't just list off the games you're playing in your comment. Elaborate with your thoughts on the games and make it easier for other users to find what game you're talking about by putting the title in **bold**. 

Also, please make sure to use spoiler tags if you're revealing anything about a game's plot that may significantly impact another player's experience who has not played the game yet, no matter how retro or recent the game is. You can find instructions on how to do so in the subreddit sidebar. 

This thread is set to sort comments by 'new' on default.

ff5fko,Martyisruling,The Mass Effect Trilogy,"Another Redditor reminded me of my first go 'round with the Mass Effect Trilogy.

I remember the hype revolving around that game even before the first one released. And how the first Mass Effect lived up to the hype and the sequel surpassed it. 

The story telling was amazing. And for the record, it pretty much was all the way through until the very end. The professional game journalists, critics and game makers never REALLY understood why the fans were so angry with the original ending. ( Not that the improved ending was really much better.)

If you played Mass Effect years later. You might not understand either. So, I'll explain.

Even before Mass Effect released, game journalists were raving about this game. The game makers talked about how every choice you made would have an impact on the story now and then, much later. Each and every choice could come back to haunt you, even in the final game of the trilogy. 

Mass Effect released, you had a huge world, with a lot of story and a lot of side missions. And, the game lived up to the hype. The game play was good, the story great. And every choice you made had consequences as promised. 

Mass Effect 2 releases 3 years later. Fan hype is high, journalist hype is high. The game exceeds most people's expectations. There are tons of characters, DLC content is actually fulfilling. The characters all have depth, their own stories and the end of this game has SERIOUS consequences.

After the first game and up until the release of the third in the trilogy, fans began to speculate on each story every side mission, how could it effect things going forward? What impact would it have on the final game?

Fans had multiple saves for all the different endings. The game makers kept reaffirming, all these choices would have an impact. 

Then the third game released. And while the game play was solid, and the story was good, the ending felt, empty. It turned out that the original ending of the trilogy was the same, unless you count the color of a light that went through the relays. 

Later, the game makers added a clip that showed some.of the surviving characters. This did almost nothing.

I can't speak for every fan. But I believe most of them were upset for the same reason I was. Apart from one or two characters, the fate of the others are never really shown. So your choice at the end and it's impact is left to your imagination. And it turns out that whatever you decided in the previous two games, had no impact on the third, unless a character died in the others and then, they simply weren't there.

In the end your alliances had no impact on the end of the game. Whoever was going to live or die, would love be or die anyway. Whatever was going to happen was going to happen anyway. And, these characters you had spent 3 games with, years with, speculating their date, investing in them, you were left wanting. 

Game journalists defended the ending, and only understood half the reason why fans were upset. Game makers too. 

If play through it now, not hearing any of the hype, not left to wait, wonder and imagine what could be, the anger would be lost on you. 

I'm not angry anymore, I wasn't really, I was just disappointed. I think if the game was remastered I would enjoy it a lot. And none of that past disappointment would return. I mean, I wouldn't expect more than it could deliver.",10,1583632056,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/ff5fko/the_mass_effect_trilogy/,Games,1

ff3mx7,Nemesisgif,PvP Rant about Shooters,"PvP Rant about shooters

Let me preface this by saying, i’ve been gaming since i was little and i like to think i’m above average in skill across a ton of games.  Not a pro or anything, but i’ve managed to get in high ranks on any game i play. I know everyone plays different etc.


Lately these pst few years i’ve started noticing that games rely on nothing but the cheapest wins, metas, camping or overall just boring ways of winning. It’s getting to the point that i’ve gradually stopped playing multiplayer games simply because nobody enjoys actual competition or fun. 
It’s their game and they can play how they want, i understand that, but when every match i join (whether it be Call of Duty, Destiny, Overwatch, PUBG or etc) is only full of the most broken guns/characters and setups possible, it tends to get really frustrating. 


Camping, it seems you can’t play any shooter without every lobby having half the teams in corners. It’s easy to come back and kill them, but that is no challenge at all, might as well go up against bots at that point. The matches just end up feeling empty when only 4 players are running around when there’s 12 per lobby.


Metas, i understand metas help you win in comp/ranked matches, but if you are only going to play to win or cheese through competition, then why not just go play against bots or story mode? I personally pick characters i enjoy and get good with them whether they are the weakest or the strongest. I take my time to get good with what i have and hold my weight sometimes even carry with off-meta setups. It makes the game fun because i don’t rely on cheap weapons or buffs to help me start winning. 


Matchmaking, it really ruins my day when i get thrown into a match where my entire team is scattered and randoms vs clans or people that only stick in big groups. It’s smart i’m not gonna say it’s not, but it really just reinforces cheap ways to win if only one side is running in a hive mind group and i’m alone trying my best to beat them. 


All in all, i just wanted to say that games aren’t what they used to be, nobody plays for fun or skill anymore like they used to. It’s all about cheap wins, skins and K/D. 

I would love to enjoy a good game where every is just playing the challenge and everything is actually balanced. 



Side note: i don’t only play shooters, i just wish i could enjoy them like i used to.

This game is probably not that old because it already had 3d graphics, and I remember it looking good.

In this game, in first story quest I was commanding group of american soliders, in which aliens attacked earth. Commander had special abilities, I also remember flamethrowers.

I think it was in washington.

That alien race which attacked was one of the 3 alien races possible to play and encounter in the game.

1. There was evil, typical looking alien race, which used big robots with four legs, all legs had to be destroyed, and then core of the robot.
2. There was 'modern alien race', which was good one in the game, themed white, they used electricity similar to ones we use. You had to build electricity lines to your buildings with this race.
3. Third alien race used light or dark energy (you could choose), their units looked ancient and cannon like.

fez3tq,lsdaxter,"Just finished a replay of Mass effect trilogy, thoughts about Mass effect 3 in Hindsight","Just finished another playthrough of mass effect, this is my 5th but first one in a few years. So felt I had slightly fresher eyes going through it again this time. These are my favourite games, and I dont think Ive played any other game through more than once. But as I was playing and got about two thirds of the way through 3 I started to notice a feeling of dread. Once I got to the earth mission, I think I took about a week off from playing after having raced through all 3 games in about that same time.

The ending is much improved with the DLC I think, the leviathan DLC and all the patches they did post release have made it something much more coherent if still underwhelming. Its gone from being awful to being passable. Yet I still approached that final mission with a complete lack of enthusiasm to play through the ending again. 

Mass effect 3 is a strange experience, because the vast majority of it is brilliant. I think the first 2 thirds are incredible, and I loved the dynamic of playing the galaxy's most badass diplomat and negotiating with the Milky way's races one by one to join the cause, whilst the Tuchanka and rannoch missions are the best stuff the game has done I think, along with the suicide mission in Mass 2.

The deaths that happen in the early game are brilliantly executed, feel meaningful and earned. Wouldnt lose those moments for anything.

But playing it again, I think its more than just the starchild that sours the ending and I wanted to talk that out after having experienced it again: 

**Mass Effect 2 Left too much ground to cover:** Mass effect 2 is my favourite game ever, but I think the complaint that it essentially moved the plot forward no way nearly enough. Even if the collectors and cerberus were to be the A plot, perhaps some B plots with the council with shepards attempts to prepare for the reapers, or maybe even curing the genophage could have been moved to this game. Or potentially More with the Asari and their secret origins. Its a great game from start to finish, but perhaps it could have taken a little more responsibility for the bigger picture.

**Kai Leng:** Kai leng starts to take centre stage in the latter game, and for the most part I think this character doesn't land. Feels to much like a traditional 'game' villain and there's no connection to him outside of REALLY not liking him after what he does to REDACTED. I think his role in mass 3 should have been performed by Miranda, with the illusive man having captured her and placed one of those control chips in her head she wanted to put inside of shepard in Mass 2. Facing the moral quandary of trying to  free her from the villain before you have to kill her for the greater good, would have made the whole dynamic with cerberus in this game more complex and with the potential hard choice at the end of it.

**Thessia:** I actually think this is the mission where it starts to go off the rails, and does a lot to set the tone of the game betraying the 'choices matter' ethos. It feels very similar to the virmire mission in Mass 1, in that its purpose is essentially for you to lose. That's the whole point of the mission, to let thing reach their lowest ebb before a victorious finale. Two problems with this, Mass 3 unlike Mass 1 doesnt have a victorious finale really, by design therefore piling on the bad vibes to prepare you for more bad vibes later on. With virmire, you accomplish the objective but lose a squadmate, but there's still a since its worth it. Thessia you fail the mission, you lose the fight while the villains laugh in your face and most importantly choice is a non factor. You can't even choose how you lose, IE lose a Squadmate or get the info or a choice along those lines. It leaves a real bad taste and Im not sure for what reason as far as the story goes. Just to make it darker essentially, which I dont think a game about galactic apocalypse needed help with.

**Earth:** The war assets mechanic essentially implies there's a last battle, a la suicide mission, where every asset you've collected will matter in some way, a la ship upgrades mattering to whether you lose companions or not. Choosing the Krogan over the rachni should matter in this fight, making peace with the quarians and the geth should matter in this fight. The world state you build prior to earth, should dictate everything about the mission's progression. I get there's budget issues and time issues, but the final mission should have been this game's no. 1 priority and should have been like its own 2-3 hour movie, playing out in stages. The suicide mission only the whole galaxy. I wonder if a way to execute this would have been to have shepard play general for this fight, and have a series of segments where you play as the various squadmates leading their segment of the battle. Wrex on the front lines, Tali, Jack, Joker in the normandy etc... And one by one the decisions you make during the course of the battle would have effected their fate. Shepard would take centre stage at the end of it all of course, maybe play the 2nd half, but doing this for the first half of the mission may have established the scale the battle needs, and the cost of it to all races of the milky way. 

Earth as it stands has always felt a little flat to me, not really getting your allies involved and essentially being reaper horde mode until u run for the beam. Again it sets the tone of disconnection from choices and what the game is supposed to be about.

**Starchild:** The illusive man stuff in the citadel works really well for me to be honest, its the best scene in the endgame and I wouldn't really change it. TIM is a great villain in this game and martin sheen kills it. When you get to the starchild though, well its been said hasn't it lol. I do think it plays better with the extended edition plus the context of the leviathan mission though. By a lot.

Thanks for indulging my rant lol, just had to get it out of my system...",173,1583605428,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fez3tq/just_finished_a_replay_of_mass_effect_trilogy/,Games,1

fev0lz,SylvineKiwi,Do you remember Titanfall ?,"Sorry for the click baity tittle, but I really want to talk about Titanfall (the first one) and I can't find any specific angle to approach it.

I thought about this after randomly stumbling on this after watching the last Noclip video : https://youtu.be/QKq-VyeiXlY

I mean, if you're not super young and are reading this, you obviously remember Titanfall, it's not that old and it was not some obscure indy game, and the franchise is still relevant in some way (Apex Legend is set in the same universe).

But it was so short lived that I guess for a lot of players, all remains are blurred memories of a CoD clone with robots, and most of these images are probably coming from the sequel and not the original game.

Like, do you remember the first reveal at E3 ? https://youtu.be/z5sqPxbLmIU

Do you remember what were your thoughts at that moment ?

I rarely been so hyped for a game before, it looked so intriguing, the narrative elements inserted in a standard PvP format, the array of movements, the David Vs Goliath feel of the Titans...

The best part was that unlike your typical heavily scripted multiplayer game trailer, the actual game was even more impressive.

So as you know, the game sadly didn't lived up to the hype, and was heavily criticized for various reasons, reasons I think are unfair and unjustified.

It's still one of my favourite game ever, and the sequel (or Apex Legend) certainly didn't captured what I loved in this outlier in the AAA industry.

So what do you think and remember about Titanfall ?

Did you played it and if not, why ?

Did you liked it ? Why, why not ?",20,1583587145,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fev0lz/do_you_remember_titanfall/,Games,1

But why? Hollywood announced blockbuster films several years in advance and television is the same way. Why are games in particular so secretive?

It's especially hilarious when *every* new Assassins Creed game leaks and Ubisoft refuses to comment on it. Then they reveal it at E3 like it's some huge surprise.

We are wondering if we should port our game both on PC &amp; on Mobile since it is a game that could theoretically be played on both. The problem is the following; **pricing**.

If we put the game out on pc at a fair price for an indie game, that same price would be enormous on the mobile market. You would never buy a 14$ game on mobile! So it forces us to bring the game down on steam to a more mobile friendly space. But here come another problem... people mostly don't buy cheap game on steam... since they look like junk.   


Our actual strategy would be to split our pc version &amp; mobile version in chunks in order to make it more friendly to both sphere, but we are still uncertain and this is why we came here asking you folks.

Would you buy a 8$ full game on steam?  
Would you buy half a game for 4 buck on steam? (you may get the full version for an additional 4$)  
Would you buy a 2$ 1/4 of a game on mobile (same as above)?  


Thank you for your help folks!",0,1583551006,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fep930/a_simple_question_from_a_gamedev/,Games,1
fep7wp,Intern_Waffle,"How did Jak and Daxter get away with being an obscenely well animated 60FPS game on the PS2, while almost *every other game* on the system didn't bother with...either?","I just started Jak and Daxter today for the first time in probably 10 years.

It's 60fps. Every single dialogue interaction with someone is fully animated with unique animation sequences for each scene. There are no canned animations being used. Small details like a ribbon on someone's wrist are animated to wiggle around or move around with their body. A farmer sitting on a bench had a big roll of hay on his back that deformed along with the chair he was sitting on instead of being static.

 Every cutscene is fully animated the same way, with no canned animations. Not even *walk cycles*, people are moving around completely naturally, full attention to every frame of their movement. It's insane to me. It's even a little weird *for modern games* to do this. There's canned animations constantly in fully HD AAA titles. Look at a game like FFXIV- it's *nothing* but canned animations. Look at a game like FFXV- it's not nothing but, but there's a lot of them in dialogue and cutscenes.

 Unless the game's fully mo-capped, it's not going to have animations like this. Characters will stand and idle and turn to you when you talk to them while your character stands there doing a canned animation. Mario games, Zelda games, games known partially for the polish behind how they *look*...canned animations, everywhere, constantly.

What was so distinct about Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank that they didn't do this?",391,1583550843,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fep7wp/how_did_jak_and_daxter_get_away_with_being_an/,Games,1

&gt;Unfortunately while it could be difficult for newcomers, I would still recommend learning it through Murder by Numbers, because solving one feels incredibly rewarding, especially if it involves unraveling a murder mystery.

**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Vikki Blake](https://opencritic.com/critic/2833/vikki-blake) - [Recommended](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-05-murder-by-numbers-review-a-witty-winning-combo-of-puzzler-and-visual-novel)

&gt;Shades of Picross and Phoenix Wright blend together in this unlikely but utterly lovable genre mash-up.

&gt;Whether you’re a fan of Picross, or whether you enjoy a good murder mystery, I can’t recommend Murder By Numbers enough.

-------------

**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - [Filipe Da Silva Barbosa](https://opencritic.com/critic/3787/filipe-da-silva-barbosa) - *French* - [7 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/3606-murder-by-numbers-pc-switch)

&gt;With Murder by Numbers, Mediatonic has managed to mix various elements from visual novel games with nonograms. The gameplay lacks of variety but the overall setting is sufficiently engaging, thanks to its characters, to make sure the player will stay until the very end.

-------------

**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Rachel Weber](https://opencritic.com/critic/5138/rachel-weber) - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/murder-by-numbers-game-review/)

&gt;Murder by Numbers has all the logic of picross with the look and feel of your favorite childhood cartoon.

&gt;This charming crime drama is packed with emotion, and provides the perfect framework for your journey into Picross. Murder by Numbers masterful learning curve and beautiful art style will keep you coming back for more, and its heart-felt story will stop you from ever putting it down

&gt;Murder by Numbers is a game for people who enjoy playing nonogram/Picross puzzles.

-------------

**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [PJ O'Reilly](https://opencritic.com/critic/1742/pj-oreilly) - [8 / 10](http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/murder_by_numbers)

&gt;Murder By Numbers successfully manages to combine an entertainingly wacky series of whodunnit mysteries starring a properly entertaining cast of characters with some excellent puzzling that'll keep Picross fans happy for a good long while.

-------------

**[Nintendo Times](https://opencritic.com/outlet/658/nintendo-times)** - [10 / 10](https://nintendotimes.com/2020/03/05/murder-by-numbers-review/)

&gt;OUTSTANDING - Murder By Numbers combines Picross puzzle solving with graphic novel gameplay and completely nails the experience thanks to its hilarious writing, endearing characters, awesome visuals, and stellar soundtrack. Fans of either genre should fall in love with this game, and newcomers will find a game that’s approachable and addicting.

-------------

**[NintendoWorldReport](https://opencritic.com/outlet/138/nintendoworldreport)** - [Neal Ronaghan](https://opencritic.com/critic/1517/neal-ronaghan) - [9.5 / 10](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/53094/murder-by-numbers-switch-review)

&gt;I'm pleased to not be let down by my cascading hype as it turns out that Mediatonic has a firm grasp on the distinctive appeal of Ace Attorney's world and characters, putting together a flashy and bright '90s world that wouldn't feel out of place if it was actually across town from Phoenix and the gang. Throw in the well-executed Picross puzzles and you have yourself one of the best surprises of 2020. Here's hoping we can see more of this enjoyable cast of characters and welcome visual novel twist.

-------------

**[Rice Digital](https://opencritic.com/outlet/513/rice-digital)** - [Glenn Shiraishi](https://opencritic.com/critic/6905/glenn-shiraishi) - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.ricedigital.co.uk/murder-numbers-review/)

&gt;Despite some awkward difficulty spikes, cheap reference humour, and some characters being hit or miss with me, I have had a good time with Murder by Numbers. It was a huge learning curve to solve these puzzles and I'm certain that fans of Ace Attorney and similar titles who also happen to be skilled at Picross will have a fantastic time with the story and the cast of colourful and wacky characters.

&gt;Murder By Numbers is a fun and funny 90s romp for nonogram enthusiasts, but perhaps not the casuals.

feaxmc,DrNigg,What is your most hated mechanic in a game?,"Sometimes game developers come up with a game mechanic that is just so mindboggingly bad, you start to wonder why that person even got his job.

Personally, I've hated the daze mechanic in world of warcraft with a passion since the day the game came out. For those unaware of what it does, every enemy that hits you in the back has a chance to slow you down immensily and knocking you off your mount if you're on one. This effect can chain indefinitely, so you're basically not allowed to run through groups of mobs even if they are quite a bit lower level then you. The savior of the world, destroyer of evil titans who is wearing the most legendary items of gear, has to watch out for that one lower level bird because that one bird WILL ruin your day.

Are there (or were there) any mechanics in other games that made you want to throw your monitor through the nearest window?",2415,1583485719,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/feaxmc/what_is_your_most_hated_mechanic_in_a_game/,Games,1

feah9n,Elitestrike_cz,Please help me find an old rpg game for android that I played 5 or 6 years ago. It means a lot to me.,"It's like 5 to 6 years ago I played it, I want to play it again but I don't remember the name. Some facts that could help:

Theme: It was on 100% medieval game, but there was also some mythical monsters, I remember there was a flying light in one location. There was missions too, I think it was like kill these mobs and loot from them or something like that. 

Map: As I remember, I was in a village (probably main spot of the game), and if I wanted to go somewhere else, I had to go through some kind of teleportation, in the village there was a blacksmith I think, and there was a training place where you were able to shoot arrows to wheat people built on a stick (I don't remember how does it call 😅) . There was also two other locations that I remembered, river and the forest (there is a lot of them these I'm saying here are just ones that I remember). In the forest, there was a lot of trees like a really much of them and some kind of (sidewalk? maybe?) like it was a small dirt sidewalk, like those you walk on when you go an a trip in forest. And the river, the map was a river and on both sides of it, there was a land, you were able to go to the water and swim. There was a bridge above the river to get on the other side, I think it was destroyed but I don't know for sure. If you wanted to teleport to the other location, you had to go through the whole map. (Example: there is a forest than river and than some city, you had to go from start of the forest to the other side of location to get to the portal. So easily said, you were not able to teleport anywhere, you had to go level by level. ) 

Mobs: As I mentioned earlier, there was in the forest flying light, it was yellow and it had wings, it was small and the wings were even smaller. You were obviously able to fight everything (except friendly NPCs), I think that those lights were one of the hardest ones.

It was old RPG game that meant and still means a lot to me... Please help me find it I will be really thankful. At least if you don't know it or don't know how to find it out, then share it please, I really need to find this game of my childhood. Thank you.

Also please contact me if you need more details.",1,1583482547,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/feah9n/please_help_me_find_an_old_rpg_game_for_android/,Games,1

fe1i01,Smooth_Complaint,"In defense of ""wanting to play a superhero.""","I hear this charge come up wearily often in debates over games that are brutal or unfair or make you want to pound your controller into a fine paste. ""Oh you want to play a superhero."" The response comes with a sneer.

And what of it? This is the video game medium. There's room for games that make you feel powerful and no shame in preferring those. A lot of people don't have much power in their real lives. This is where they get to experience the power and agency they lack in their real lives. 

That doesn't mean the game lacks challenge. 

Batman Arkham is an example of a game that makes you feel powerful while still offering a challenge to those who seek it. If you can handle the basics of button pressing, Batman will kick ass competently. If you can achieve mastery of the combos, Batman will kick ass masterfully and you'll score achievements and level faster. 

But let the less skilled player feel like a badass too, just a lesser one. Not everyone has the leet skills and not everyone can ever reach that level, but everyone who buys a game should be able to have a good time. That's what a game that lets you be a ""superhero"" in the non literal sense can do. 

Games that don't provide this experience, that insist on being tooth grinding challenges should do everything to warn the consumer prior to purchase that this is the type of game they're buying so that they don't waste their money. Not every player gets joy out of having to buy new controllers and monitors because they've thrown their old controller at their monitor.",88,1583440124,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fe1i01/in_defense_of_wanting_to_play_a_superhero/,Games,1

If you're reading this on a web browser, chances are that code I wrote plays a small part in making that happen. I wrote about 100K lines of code for the ANGLE middleware library that's being used for GPU acceleration in different web browsers, as well as doing small contributions to the Chromium browser engine.

However, since then I made a switch to running a tiny game studio of my own and haven't regretted it for a single day. My company recently released its debut game: mud based puzzle game Puddle Knights on Steam.

I’ll definitely try out the DnD groups and see how loud or noisy the environment might be. 
I play on a 144HZ monitor at home on Apex (ex pred, haven’t grinded this season) so I figure that will help me judge their set up fairly well as I usually coach friends who are newer to the game and get them set up for success.
I probably won’t play much console since I do play PC, but I might give rocket league a go or something where I believe controller is a bit more comfortable in my opinion.

fdxvy9,gordofredito,"Pokemon Home rant, is it the worst thing Pokemon has ever done?","Hello everyone, I wanted to start a discussion since I got a Pokemon Sword for my birthday, as someone with a Living Dex (pre-Gen VIII) and a former Event trader on the 3DS, buying Pokemon Home was a no brainer. I literally have 1,236 Pokemon on PokeBank and my sub on that ends in 8 days as of today, so naturally, I was forced to pay for Home if I wanted to keep my Pokemon I have since 2004. Well, there are a lot of issues which I will discuss here and explain why it's simply the worst thing Pokemon has done to date.

* GTS, something that was in 3DS games is now in this app. What is GTS you ask? Well, you deposit a Pokemon and ask for another in exchange. This can be easily exploited but there are usually honest people who just want pokemon from other versions, so why does it suck? Well, for starters it's not even on the Switch app, it's on your phone only. Even worse? People can still ask for Pokemon that are literally impossible to obtain, since Pokemon need levels to evolve, a Charizard (example) pre-level 35 is literally impossible to obtain, yet people keep asking for them. Thus, cluttering the GTS and just endlessly hurting the experience.

* Wonder Trade - well this one kind of improved, except it's also on your phone, not on Switch. While it's still kind of confusing, now you can send a ton of random pokemon and you will probably get trash, but that hs awlays been since WT came into the franchise. So this is probably the only feature that doesn't suck.

* Friend Trade - okay, here is where it gets... WEIRD. You can add friends to Pokemon Home (only on phone btw), this is convenient since you can trade anywhere without taking your Switch or any risks. The downside? you HAVE to be in the same room as your friends to trade. Yup, it's not a remote thing. Therefore, it's useless. Surely there must be a way to trade with people internationally, right? Well, there kind of is. But it's implementation is as backwards as you'd expect.

Trade Room - this is the most Nintendo and GameFreak feature imaginable and almost the sole reason I made this post. So, it's a relatively interesting thing. Many people can join a Trade Room, upon joining you must select the Pokemon you wish to trade. Sounds standard? Well, the thing is you can't control who you trade with. So you are basically randomly trading with anyone in the room. Want to trade with only one person? well, a third person has to join, wait for a 3 minute long timer to count to 0, then the third person has to disconnect, to ensure both of you trade between each other. Mythicals are banned from trading here, so Event trading is pretty much impossible. Oh, and if you want to create a Trade Room, you need to be a premium subscriber.

Now, the prices for this service are: 

* $3.99 for 30 days
* $5.99 for 90 days
* $16.99 annually

What does it mean to have a Premium Subscriber?
here is a [chart by GameFreak](https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/larger/public/field/image/2020/01/pokemon-home-cost.jpg?itok=UkwDVZGk). Oh and the Switch app is useless, it literally only serves one purpose: taking your pokemon from Pokemon Home into Sword and Shield.

This is honestly just as bad as what Bethesda has tried to pull with  Fallout 76, except it's not $99 like their Premium version. Yet GameFreak keeps getting away with it, how? or why?

Wanted to make this discussion as Pokemon-noob friendly as possible for everyone to understand and possibly join in.",8,1583426243,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fdxvy9/pokemon_home_rant_is_it_the_worst_thing_pokemon/,Games,1

Alexios and Kassandra are ok as characters but it feels like the game misses the potential of this Thor vs Loki angry disenfranchised brother kind of storyline, by the time you get to the interesting parts of the main storyline you feel so uninvolved in it that you just don't care.

The combat and activities in the game are pretty great, the fighting and naval battles are absolutely amazing and addicting and the system as a whole of skill progression and possible builds is pretty deep and engaging and it troubles me that the game is so weak in the story department.",23,1583400998,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fdsw7z/what_was_the_problem_with_assassins_creed_odyssey/,Games,1

Quake Live and Quake Champions don't breach 1k players on Steam.

fdg83u,ragtag7,Games that deserve a sequel as a second chance,"I always think about (insert game here) that failed because of multiple reasons that actually could succeed if given a second chance with a sequel or a remake (not a remaster).

There is so much potential in preexisting titles that had amazing concepts that could still be fully realized and kept canon in their storytelling all at the same time if given the right team and chance. 

Haze and The Order: 1866 are the ones that always seem to come to my mind immediately. There are tons of titles that now lay in obscurity as that one time someone tried something different but failed. I hope next generation could possibly see some of these titles revived. 

Thoughts? 

I'd love to hear what you think deserves a new breath of life with a sequel and how you might follow it up with your approach to its storytelling. Maybe you have a certain dev studio in mind for it? It doesn't have to be a game with a single player component either. It could be a game like Brink, amazing ideas, but completely disappointed audiences.",1054,1583342195,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fdg83u/games_that_deserve_a_sequel_as_a_second_chance/,Games,1

- The game is a three player game (One Story Teller if improvised story). One player of each created class for the game. Players will create a name and a short background if wanted. Players will each roll three 6-sided die at the same time to pass the room. 

- The three players will play across a board of nine rooms. 4 of the rooms adds a 2 point bonus to a character class. Each room has a trap that the players have to survive. A player rolls under a 5, they die. They roll above a 10, the trap is disarmed and everyone lives regardless of the score.

- Each room has a storyboard that unravels a mystery, story of survival, and/or magic. You can apply any genre your want to this game.

- Each class action will have a story to it.  EX: How a Warrior disarmed a spike trap, how a mage survives a giant spider, how a rogue shot himself in the face and died.

* [A-Train 6 / A列車で行こう6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4exqS3jy-0) - later released in EU territories
* [DrumMania/ドラムマニア](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73p0nFmtHKk) - you could play with the drummania drum set which was pretty novel
* [Eternal Ring/エターナルリング](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoZfAbtOBYk) - Fromsoftware game, also released outside of japan, re-released on the ps4
* Kakinoki Shogi IV/ソフト 柿木将棋IV (sorry coudn't find the vid, just the cover art) - basic shogi game
* [Kessen/決戦](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZt6Cyk6gvw) - a solid entry. Got 2 sequels and is praised to this day.
* [Mahjong Taikai III/麻雀大会Ⅲ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EDuvLgGS4Q) - mahjong with Koei wacky characters. The series ran from the famicom to the ps2, wii etc; the ps3 got a sequel, taikai IV, too.
* Morita Shogi/森田将棋 (basic shogi game, didn't have online features such as the n64 launch title)
* [Ridge Racer V/ リッジレーサーファイブ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dg1Nmxtf8k) - game speaks for itself. Masterpiece. Much like soul calibur on the dc, this one was a """"meh"""" arcade game but namco delivered an amazing console port.
* [Stepping Selection/ステッピングステージ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbpCPJI-eBo)- good Lord this game... eastern european b*$#$ dancing and that ""my sharona"" guy gives me the creeps to this day
* [Street Fighter EX3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6dkrPT1M_Y) - amazing title. Supported multitap and is somehow regarded as a solid fighting game.

So basically very japanese (which is great! a little something for everyone, varied titles, fighting, strategy, sports, japanese board games, dance, rhythm, rpg) but some there are some pretty good titles, imho.

Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A ""wanted"" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.

The game's development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IV's release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. It was released in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and in April 2015 for Microsoft Windows.

Extensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in its first three days. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. However, it caused controversies related to its depiction of violence and women. Considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made, it won year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. It is the third best-selling video game of all time with over 120 million copies shipped and one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all time, with about $6 billion in worldwide revenue.

fdcha3,davidrabbich,I just cancelled my Polymega pre-order," For those unaware, Polymega is an all-in-one emulation machine covering a decent portion of older console hardware.

When I pre-ordered back in June last year (way later than some of the early early adopters) the release date said August 2019.

So I waited and August passed and nothing. The date was scrubbed from all existence.

After that, no communication came from Polymega (Playmaji) about when a revised date was going to be announced but we had 3 months of the same line from Polymega. ""We're getting ready to announce something really cool, sit tight"". So thats what the majority of us did, sit tight.

December arrived and the ""really cool"" announcement was about translation patches and light guns. Good? yes. What we've been asking for? not even a sign of it.

Then mid december they announce that Polymega will be shipping by the end of February. Ok fine, if I have to wait until then I will.

The start of February rolls around and an update comes out that the ""beta test"" signup is open. So somehow they're going to invite, select, ship and get feedback on beta units within the shortest calendar month of the year and still hit their original deadline.

It's now March 4th. no beta units have rolled out, no final units have rolled out, they still have everyones money and the biggest inslut is they just can't come out and say ""sorry guys, we're not going to make the date"" and instead hope that everyone forgot.

I've given up and I hope they get their shit together to deliver what they said they would but I'll catch up with it again once the unit is actually out.

I think a light needs to be shone on this ridiculous behaviour by Polymega and serve as a warning to anyone looking at pre-ordering.",4,1583325919,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fdcha3/i_just_cancelled_my_polymega_preorder/,Games,1

fdb3hy,Alihaadi,"Capcom Renews Mega Man Trademark, New Game Announcement Imminent?","According to a recent claim made by an industry insider, Capcom has plans to release five games for the next fiscal year which runs from April 2020 to March 2021. Four of these are said to be “big” and include two Resident Evil entries. That covers the already announced Resident Evil 3 remake and a second, unannounced installment — not Resident Evil 8.  The fifth and last game from Capcom will apparently not be on the same scale as the other four. This “medium game” will at least be not a new Dino Crisis installment. Capcom was rumored to have started work on the franchise once again but then decided to call it a day. [A new Mega Man would seem like a better contender](https://segmentnext.com/2020/03/04/capcom-renews-mega-man-trademark/), or perhaps another Ace Attorney. Seeing the Mega Man trademark renewed, though, will likely ring a few bells in the coming days.  Capcom will be mentioning the aforementioned five games (more or less) during its earnings report next month, as claimed by the same industry insider.  There have been several rumors going around for Capcom. Word through the grapevine mentioned Dragon’s Dogma 2 last year. There were also rumblings of a remastered Onimusha. Street Fighter 6 is something that could see to a next-generation release as well — the current installment is already four years old. Not to forget that last month, Capcom filed a trademark for something called Pragmata that many belief is for a new game.  The Mega Man franchise, for those interested, has sold over 35 million copies worldwide across multiple mainline entries and spin-offs as of December 31, 2019. Mega Man 11 was the most recent installment to release back in 2018.",1,1583317597,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/fdb3hy/capcom_renews_mega_man_trademark_new_game/,Games,1
