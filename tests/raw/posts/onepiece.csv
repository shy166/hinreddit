fsmo20,Pale-Wallaby07,Newbie rates the arcs he‚Äôs read so far,"So I wanted to rate the arcs I‚Äôve read from 0-10, I want to keep writing  here until I either catch up to the manga or the manga ends 

Arc 1: Romance Dawn

Rating: 7

-A pretty average introduction to One Piece, it was fun and being introduced to pirates and marines was pretty cool 

Arc 2: Orange Town

Rating: 6

-I hate this arc, it was the part that made me get bored of the manga (good thing I kept reading). Buggy D. Clown is a crappy and ugly villan that I fucking hate. At least this arc introduced Nami

Arc 3: Syrup Village

Rating: 6.5

-A pretty meh arc, I‚Äôm not a big fan of Ussop. Captain Kuro was badass for like 2 seconds before he got his ass beat by Luffy and I now realize his ‚Äúevil plan‚Äù was really stupid. It also has some pretty cringe moments with Usopp and his ‚Äúpirate crew‚Äù of little kids. It does have some cool battles but that‚Äôs it.

Arc 4: Baratie arc

Rating: 8.7

-I freaking love this arc, cool battles, great characters and Sanji!. The backstory of this cook and Mr Zeff is tragic and very well made. Don Krieg isn‚Äôt a perfect villan but the tricks he has up his sleeve make his battle with Luffy more exciting. The ending was very nice and emotional

Arc 5: Arlong Park

Rating: 8.6

-Amazing, Nami‚Äôs backstory is soo tragic and well made. This arc really makes the reader sympathize with Nami due to all the suffering she went through. Arlong is really cool, it was the first time that a villan seemed stronger than Luffy and the first time a villan was a total dick. The downside is  the terrible battles against Arlong‚Äôs officers, just terrible. Other than that it was pretty amazing.

Note: I loved Luffy vs Arlong, it was HYPE

Arc 6: Loguetown

Rating: 7.5

-A cool last stop before the GrandLine, I loved the panel of Luffy looking at the execution stand of the last pirate king. Buggy‚Äôs appearance was not a nice surprise and the his ‚Äútease‚Äù implies he is going to appear again (oh god no). Other than that Captain Smoker was really badass and the mysterious pirate that saves the strawhats is a nice addition.

-Zoro‚Äôs sword buying was a really also a really nice moment 

Arc 7: Reverse Mountain

Rating:7.5

- Last stop before the first Grand Line island, sees the Strawhats dealing with an abandoned whale. The whale‚Äôs backstory was pretty emotional and what Luffy did made me love him more. Overall a short but sweet arc

fslf6x,maiden_masher,I'm at episode of 440 and... for a shounen. One Piece is oddly progressive.,"Like, sure, Ivan looks like the most caricature of a person ever. But everyone looks like a caricature of a person so I don't really take offense to that.

But what surprises me is like... how Ivan, Bon Clay, basically most queer characters are  portrayed so positively in terms of plot.

Ivan is the stereotypical hedonist you find in any anime, but while a lot of anime would make this character the villain, Ivan... really isn't the bad guy. Sure, he's mostly out for himself and his gang but he still can be compassionate and have a very interesting ideal of miracle only being possible by the human spirit which I appreciate.

Bon Clay I feel like I don't even got yo say anything, lately he's been such a protag in these last couple of episodes it feels like he's part of the Straw Hats without even trying, and despite his flamboyancy, he feels other emotions and truly cares about Luffy, it's not like he wants to fuck him, he just wants his friend to be ok.

Plus the whole Ivan community thing is actually pretty liberal of ""being whoever you want to be"" and although his mannerism are played as a joke, his way of life isn't really. These people are just living how they want.

I dont know maybe people disagree with me, but as a bisexual man leaning toward men, it's sadly refreshing to see the flamboyant ones in an anime to not be a villainous predator. (After Okama island. This one is actually a rather good redemption.)",65,1585689052,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fslf6x/im_at_episode_of_440_and_for_a_shounen_one_piece/,OnePiece,4

fskkce,hothraka,Manga Translations,"So I recently finally got into the manga. I've tried a few times after having watched a bunch of the anime but I kept running into some really low quality fan translations that turned me off of it. Finally decided to start from the beginning with the official VIZ translation and its been a much better experience.

I'm in the Sky Island saga and all of a sudden, in I think chapter 265, there was a sudden, very noticeable dropoff in quality in the translation. All the phrasing and writing just sounds way less natural now and its not nearly as fun to read anymore. It all culminated in [this incorrectly translated cover story title](https://i.imgur.com/clM8JwN.jpg) which made me want to look somewhere else. I had a translation of the colored version downloaded but didn't prefer the writing in it but ever since chapter 265 its the better version.

I really don't know anything about the different scanlations. I'm guessing the VIZ translation has had multiple people working on it. Is there like a list of the different people who have worked on it or anything? As far as I can tell, the main sources for scanlations is Jaiminis Box and Mangastream with Jaiminis being higher quality, though I'm having trouble finding rips of it that I can read offline.

Anyway, yeah, a basic overview of the different translations by someone who knows all about it would certainly be appreciated. This particular subject has always made the manga really hard to get into for me so some help with finding the best stuff would be nice.

fsk9yy,Eadwine_,"Zoro, Nami and Chopper are in for a long overdue epithet update","I don't know about ya'll, but ""Pirate Hunter"", ""Cat Burglar"" and ""Cotton Candy Lover"" doesn't really fit anymore. Of course there's still truth in those epithets, Zoro technically still hunts pirates, Nami still loves stealing treasure and Chopper certainly hasn't stopped liking cotton candy. But c'mon these are OLD and were assigned to them pre-timeskip! Just look at what all the other Straw Hats are called in the New World:

- ""God"" Usopp (seriously how is Usopp gonna top this one)
- ""Black Leg"" Sanji (could use an update as well tbh)
- ""Light of the Revolution"" Nico Robin
- ""Iron Man"" Franky
- ""Soul-King"" Brook
- ""Knight of the Sea"" Jinbe

(Not including Luffy since ""Straw Hat"" is too iconic + we all know he's gonna be ""Pirate King"" Luffy at the end of the series.)

Now I'm no Oda so I have no idea what new epithets should be assigned for any of them, though I have seen ""Weather Witch"" been thrown out a lot for Nami and think it's very fitting.

In conclusion, we are rapidly approaching the end of the series in a couple of years and you're telling me Zoro is gonna be known as ""Pirate Hunter"" until he's the WSS?

fsji2d,gyuukarubi5,"Translation Issues: ""The Straw Hat Pirates"" vs. ""The Straw Hat Gang"" &amp; the Implications","Language is extremely important in One Piece. We've started to realize, in retrospect, how Oda has peppered the series with hints towards something greater. An example of this is Blackbeard dropping the term ""Haki"" way back in Jaya, before the concept was ever formally introduced.

Reading through [Greg's](https://one-piece.com/special/greg) Twitter, I came across something very interesting.

[The Straw Hat crew is never called ""The Straw Hat Pirates"" in the original Japanese text](https://twitter.com/StephanyoMemes/status/1240098099034497026?s=20). While often called a Pirate Crew (Êµ∑Ë≥äÂõ£), Oda actually writes it as ""È∫¶„Çè„Çâ„ÅÆ‰∏ÄÂë≥"" ‚Äî¬†""The Straw Hat Gang.""

I've long thought that the acts of Luffy's merry band don't fall into the traditional realm of ""piracy,"" as they don't loot or plunder. Their crew is very different from other pirate crews ‚Äî rather, they're more akin to revolutionaries. They liberate countries and declared war on the World Government.

Could Luffy ever hang up his pirate hat to be a revolutionary? I actually feel that it's more in line with Luffy's characters to reject titles altogether ‚Äî he only cares about ""freedom.""",15,1585683029,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fsji2d/translation_issues_the_straw_hat_pirates_vs_the/,OnePiece,4

I have some ideas what the acrs are about but I know that they dont even animate one chapter per episode which isn't good so should I use one pace for these?

fsgjkr,DangerousKawada,My Journey,"Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this kind of thing comes up often, so my apologies if it does. I hope you're all keeping safe in these shitty times we're dealing with.

I'll say there might be possible spoilers ahead with my post with the anime from Ep 1-483, so don't read ahead of you're behind.

I originally watched One Piece in Australia probably mid 2000's, I'm not sure on the exact date or even year. It was dubbed and I really enjoyed it, but then it stopped.

I never really thought anything about it until it became available on a streaming platform again. I'm a big fan of Japanese variety shows but I'd really not had that much interest in anime aside from Berserk, Cowboy Bebop and Pok√©mon all when I was younger.

I ended up watching OP because Shinya Arino mentioned it in an episode of GameCenter CX...As I watched the first episode I was a little bit interested, had a few laughs about Luffy being so nonchalant and pretty much telling Koby he was a bitch.

That was a year ago. I'm now into episode 914 and I'm obviously fully invested in everything that has happened. 

I have major anxiety, which makes it difficult to leave the house, something I find ironic in the recent climate. However, One Piece got me through all of these times... It gave me laughs, tears, anger and many, many other emotions. 

I'd watch up to 20 episodes a day sometimes. There's someone that you remember from every arc that you want to come back again in the future. 

Even people who you hated and thought as scumbags would eventually make good... Crocodile for me is one of the best Anti-heros along with Smoker of course. When Crocodile did his thing at Marineford I was cheering that bastard after hating his laugh for so long.

There's so many comedic aspects to the show. I think my favourite of all is Luffy's nicknames for people, or just mishearing/misunderstanding the name.

It honestly made it all the more jarring when Ace bit the dust. It was powerful, I still hate Akainu to this day.

I'm sad that I've almost got to the point where I'll be waiting for new episodes, but I'll always love this journey that I've gone through the past year. I've become a fan for life of something I watched on a whim.

I guess I'll end this with two questions. When did you get into One Piece and what is your favourite intro music.

I had to think hard about this, but Season 15 takes it, but 9 is very close. Season One outro will always get a notable mention... I honestly think that will end the whole show.

Obviously feel free to talk about your OP experiences and such, the questions are just for fun.

fsdyd1,notinthisworld8,Are Navy Admirals Underrated?,"Thanks to the recent poll addition it's very easy to get a general grasp on our subs opinions on many topics, especially power levels since the polls are mainly used for that. 

I've seen so many crazy opinions in the recent day about the admirals, to a point where the underestimation is becoming ridiculous. 

- Primebeard defeating all 3 admirals combined.
- EOS Luffy being able to defeat ALL Admirals, Fujitora, Kizaru, Greenbull and Akainu in a 1v4.
- Sabo being Admiral level already.
- Kizaru would've lost to Rayleigh at shabondy.
- 3 Admirals are needed to at least have a shot at defeating 1 Yonkou. 

So on and on. Those are merely opinions I've come across in the recent like 3 days. 

That triggered my interest. Why do ya'll have the Admirals on such a bad light power wise? 

They're undoubtedly on top of the food chain when it comes to Top fighters of the OP world including the Yonkou, at least to me.

fsdk6j,ChineseDelphinium,Will the Raid on Onigashima fail? Support and Counters,"A bit of the speculation here comes from Morj's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOWVbtGqyvo) from last year. When I watched this video last year, I bought the argument and agreed that the raid on Onigashima during the fire festival. Now I'm not so sure. After a year we have more information than before; I wish to organize it here for discussion:

Why the raid may fail:

1. If Kaido thinks he is safe he will be drunk and not at full power. I do not think Oda will make the final clash against Kaido be while he is drunk.
2. The 5 act Kabuki play contains a major tragedy in the third act. There hasn't been a real tragedy in the present yet; the betryal failed, everyone is there, and Oden's tragedy was in the past.
3. Nekomamushi and Jimbei don't appear to be present yet.

Why the raid may instead succeed:

1. Kaido sobers up pretty quicky (see Chapter 924).
2. The third act does not necessarily need to end in tragedy; it just needs to contain one. Certainly the middle of Chapter 974 was an extremely low point. We see the tragedy of Oden, the traitor reveals himself to the Kozukis, and all hope seems truly lost.
3. Act 3 has already been going on for a while. Act 1 (909-924) was 14 chapters and Act 2 (925-955) was 31 chapters. Act 3 (958-at least 976) will be at least 19 chapters; it could reasonably end soon and have the raid commence act 4 and lead to victory.
4. We still don't know how all the parts have been moving; big mom's crew, cp-0, and sword have all shied away from the spotlight but are undoubtedly making moves during this time. It is not at all impossible that this leads to Jimbei and Nekomamushi's arrival.
5. The last chapter was an enormous, epic turnaround from desperation to hope with luck in full bloom on their side. It feels strange to have this now end in failure.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, my predictions:

1. Kaido's reign will end within 48 hours (manga time) of the raid on onigashima.
2. There may be an initial failure but it will not at all lead to regrouping and more intensive training. Rather they will have to immediately bounce back stronger.
3. Act 3 will end in the coming chapters.

&amp;#x200B;

fs9xlt,bibek070,Doesn't Kaido 'SHOULD' also have a weakness? [Spoilers],"In One Piece and with Oda's writing, there's always some patterns that we can pick up. With Yonkou Saga, Oda has been laying out few things:

**Blackbeard:** 

His weakness is his yami yami no mi fruit itself- leaving him vulnerable against other **Yonkous (and I stress on this to make comparisons among Yonkous only)**. Whether the whole ""he can't sleep"" thing will be exploited as weakness or strength is yet to be seen, but I am inclining more towards the idea that: it will become a plot that Luffy can use if in case BB really gets 3 devil fruit and becomes too OP.

**Shanks:**

One obvious thing is he just lost one arm. Despite his reputation and still holding his current status as Yonkou no doubt; he is strong- but comparatively to others is at slight disadvantage. However, any hints toward his weakness has not yet been shown. So can't wait Oda to give this man some more screen time.

**Big Mom:**

A quick recap on her: food cravings, amnesia and mother caramel.

So with this trend among the Yonkou, it's only logical for Kaido to have one as well. I don't think Oda will break this trend by making Kaido absolutely flawless and invincible.

One apparent ""weakness"" presented to us, is his drinking habit (mood swing) and suicidal intentions. Some may disagree, but I put these up there with Big Mom's food cravings and nothing more. I will admit that Oda can play his mood swing in any direction.

One moment he is beating Luffy to death, and suddenly after couple of drinks, he forgets he is in alliance with Big Mom and starts to go off with her for no apparent reason. His mood swing can have some interesting plot twist. But, it will not be that much satisfying.

That being said,

Kaido has a dragon fruit (**let's leave he might be a dragon debate for later**). 

With dragons, the ""mainstream"" fictional story telling always has this common theme: they have tough scale, some kind of relic item to summon them/control them (like in Oda's Ryuma's story line), their belly is the weak spot, you can only kill it by putting a dagger/special sword through its heart and so on.

So considering developments in the manga, what weakness do you think Kaido may have other than the whole drunken thing?",18,1585647104,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fs9xlt/doesnt_kaido_should_also_have_a_weakness_spoilers/,OnePiece,1
fs9v9s,exoult,Questions about the chronology and World Nobles,"Hello there! I'm creating a One Piece OC and long story short I've had some trouble putting things in order myself with chronology and all that since I'm trying to tie the OC's story to some canon events. 

1. I mainly had doubts about when Fisher Tiger freed the slaves. I wanted to ask if this happened before after Whitebeard ""claimed"" Fish-Man Island? 
2. Do you guys think Fisher Tiger's actions could have somehow be seen as related to Whitebeard since the island was under his protection at the time? 
3. I know Celestial Dragons are too arrogant to even like anyone outside their community, but do they have less tolerance for fishmen because of what Tiger did? Is the reason they didn't get ""revenge"" on Fishman Island the fact that it's hard for 30% of the ships to access it, so Marines would find it hard to organize a Buster Call? Or does King Neptune have something to do with why no harm has been done since the incident?
4. I am also aware that Hancock was around 16 when she was freed, and she is 29 pretimeskip, so if I'm correct the incident in Mariegeoise happened around 13 years ago before the events of Marineford?

Another doubt I had is that since the Nefertari family were originally Celestials but decided to lay low and therefore are considered betrayers does that mean the Nefertari family's ancestors denounced their title as Celestial Dragons once, just like Doflamingo's dad did? Or did they just decide to live on their own and were therefore stripped of it? 

I'm curious because I know that World Nobles have the ability to basically do whatever they please so not wanting to live in Mariegeoise doesn't seem to be too big of a deal to take away their status. It's just a place to live, maybe some wanna live somewhere else. Doflamingo's father renounced the title himself, he wasn't not considered a Celestial Dragon anymore just because he left Mariegeoise right? So do you guys think a World Noble choosing to do whatever they want, including living somewhere else, would still let them keep their status?

I can't remember if these questions have been discussed in the series, I apologize if I seem as if I'm too lazy to do my own research but I'd like to get observations from others even if there isn't a canon answer to my questions yet.",2,1585646756,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fs9v9s/questions_about_the_chronology_and_world_nobles/,OnePiece,1

fs93mu,thebookof_,I have so many questions about Zoan fruits running through my head right now.,"Like is it safe to assume that all Zoan fruits correspond to actual organisms, and by extension all organisms have a corresponding Zoan? For example should we take the fact that Ancient Zoans exist to mean that Mammoths and Spinoaurs defiantly at one point existed in the world or One Piece? In the same way Elephant, Leopard and Giraffe fruits confirm that those creatures occur naturally in the world? If so what does that mean for Mythical Zoans? Is there an island where Phoenix occur naturally? Are there Kyubi no Kitsune in Wano? What about the other weird animal's unique to One Piece? What would a DenDen Mushi fruit be classified as, or a banana gator, what about the big Shisa that Tama tamed is there a mythical fruit that matches that species or would it be generic? If there's a human fruit does that mean theres a Human Human Fruit Model Fishman? What about a Mink model? Does Sengoku's fruit imply the existence of a mystical giant race separate from the generic giants?

1. Luffy vs Crocodile
Crocodile is boss of underground crime syndicate baroque works and luffy a struggling underdog fought him underground and send him to sky(light) , a reality, revealing that he is behind all of this.
2. luffy vs lucci
Luffy fought cp-9 Knows as government dog in one of strongest marine base under their greatest attacks ""buster call"" which is suppose wipe their existence from history for a person whose existence itself is know as crime ""Robin"" and their rescuing Robin represent that truth cannot be hide under lies. Ohara get destroyed because they ask about true history and WG summon Buster Call on them and wipe them from history. In this whole thing ""ohara"" represent ""Truth"" and Robin is part of truth and ""Buster call"" represent ""Lies"" which WG use to cover the truth.
3.Luffy vs Gecko moria 
Luffy fought gecko moria who have power of shadow and defeats him without shadow and i dont know about symbol meaning behind at all??? 
4. Luffy vs Hody jones 
well entire fishman island is about racism, slavery and trafficking which lead to fishman hating humans and hody jones who misunderstood whole thing because of one sided explanation.
He said human is inferior species 
a. Luffy beat him in ground (Human place)
after taking few drug he agin said the same thing
b. luffy beat him in water (fishman place) 
Again he takes drug and said same thing 
c. Luffy gives him final blow at ""NOAH"" (neutral place) and send him in water (home) 
-noah is created by fishmans, noah is boat, boat is mainly used at surface of seas and surface is known as human place.
- if i remember correctly ""noah"" have important meaning in religion that boat is used for rescuing animal being in earth without any discrimination.
so hody¬¥s defeat at noah represent ending of discrimination.
4. Luffy vs ceaser=????
5. luffy vs doflamingo
doflamingo is former celestial dragon and his epithet is ""heavenly demon"". He is puppet master and manipulates citizen of dressrosa. Doflamingo reminds me a lot of mythological figure ""lucifer : Falling angel and king of hell"" doflamingo: falling celestial dragon and king of dressrosa"". Well luffy gives him final blow at sky and send him to underground showing him his real place.
6. Luffy vs Katakuri 
Alot of people describe this fight as fight of will some people said this is best fight, some said its meh! but most of people completely misunderstood this fight. 
a. This is written by katakuri¬¥s perception 
 Katakuri is luffy carrying burden of responsibility, obsessed with family and most importantly he is not even himself he is playing perfect strong and proud big brother part picturize and idolize by his sibling. It means  katakuri doesn't have his own pesonality when you understand his lack of his own personality then you understand why katakuri use same kind of power like luffy in ""MIRROR WORLD"". Katakuri df shows exact same kind of ability like luffys but if you look closely there is one defect after throwing luffy¬¥s rubber returns at same place but katakuri¬¥s mochi takes time to return at same place. while fighting luffy most of time he is using exact same kind of luffys moves but after he finds that his sister is interfering the fight then he accepts himself and he uses his own move sliced mochi slayer (different name in different translation). After all katakuri realize that luffy is his reality he accepts luffy. This fight isn't written by luffy¬¥s perception its written by katakuris perception thats why this fights climax is different than other fights and truth is luffy didn't defeat katakuri, katakuri accepts luffy. there are many things in this fight 
1. If you want to get better at presentation then you have to continuously try at mirror that's why luffy get stronger after katakuris fight make sense.
2. ""Mirrors don't lie"" Since this fight is written by katakuris perception luffy and his crew destroying mirror represents that you can't run away fron truth.

There's always symbolism in the world of One Piece. Katakuri's back tattoos shows a wing. Was his father a person that was that came from a Sky Island?

fs6g1l,ff9lex,One piece: Dead or Alive - Movie idea,"I was thinking in a premise of a new ome piece movie.

A tall young man around 28yrs old appeards in the Marines HQ asking to speak with Akainu.

This boy turns out to be an old Garp student aspirant to Almirant who was remove from the marines for executing pirates that surendered cause he doenst believe they can be reformed. So he killed them Sengoku prohibit him to be part of the marines, and young Akainu was his friend but after he was thrown out he disapered.

Now that Akainu is in charge he is asking him to remove his Bounty so he can become a Bounty Hunter and start killing pirates again and make a living out of it.

On his way out he sees Garp and he tells him his target is no other than Luffy ( in revenge for garp no supporting him)

In this movie we will have a lot of participation from hemelppo and Koby, which in the final clash Koby will fight along side Luffy to take this guy out.

Another good thing we will see is the Pirate Hunter Clans and the organization for Hunting pirates which Zoro used to be a member and he will ask his old friend to help him find the villain throught the Hunter Guild.

Another plot important point is that for luring Luffy into a trap he will kidnap a young pirate that Luffy will meet in the movie that admire hims and itrs presented to Luffy by Bartolomeo from his fan club.

The villain will ""Kill"" Luffy pirate fan to make him anger at the end of the movie we find out the guy survive thanks to Buggy saving the fan from the clif he was thrown.",0,1585629223,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fs6g1l/one_piece_dead_or_alive_movie_idea/,OnePiece,1

fs58m1,Herbb__,The Shandians suck,"First time One Piece watcher here... I‚Äôve just finished episode 176 (ending with Nami, Aisa, and Gan Fall being swallowed by the massive snake).

I just wanted to rant about something that‚Äôs been killing me this whole arc. The shandians are insufferably annoying and stupid. This arc would be 1000000000x better if it wasn‚Äôt for the shandians and their pointless fight for nothing. Aisa, Raki, and all of the others just don‚Äôt contribute anything to the story besides giving Eneru‚Äôs army something to fight and creating a filler quality storyline.

But by far the absolute worst and most painful part of this arc is Wyper. He is the biggest moron we‚Äôve seen so far in the show (including the priest who literally cannot speak, accidentally rolls his eyes back to not see, and cannot cross his arms). His one goal is to get his homeland back, but if he wasn‚Äôt completely dense that would‚Äôve happened long ago when Gan Fall was still God. Instead, he acts like a two year old and insists on fighting everyone who wants to give him help. He literally just tuned out Gan Fall‚Äôs saying that he was not his enemy when he was shooting at him for no reason, and Gan Fall wasn‚Äôt even fighting back. He isn‚Äôt even good to his own people, as when Nami and Aisa first arrived at the Upper Ruins, he shot at them immediately which would‚Äôve killed both. Nothing would bring me more joy than watching Zoro chop him up into tiny pieces. I just hope he finally gets to Eneru only to get shocked into nothingness.

That‚Äôs my little rant, I truly hope I get proved wrong by the end of this arc (about the Shandians... Wyper is irredeemable).

This arc as a whole has been kind of slow, but I‚Äôve still been loving the show so far!

|Kuzan|Alvida|When things freeze water molecules are attaching themselves to something to form crystal structures (Purified water wont freeze) but nothing sticks to Alvida, even physical blows just slide past her meaning Kuzan couldn't freeze her or hit her with ice.|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Borasalino|Absalom (Shilew)|If light passes through a surface without losing its direction or its color (changing its wavelength) no energy was imparted on the surface whether that is momentum or thermal or electromagnetic meaning that frequency or wavelength doesnt interact with those materials at all.|
|Sakazuki(Crocodile too but for much more straight forward reasons)|Kalifah|In real life people can put their hands in molten things as long as its wet or covered water (soapy bubbles or otherwise) because water has a huge thermal capacity and the properties of water change drastically from liquid to solid (with the water soaking up the heat as a liquid and turning into a insulating barrier as a gas in the process). Kalifah's ability is basically to produce an endless stream of soapy water to do just that meaning if she can produce soap fast enough (she can she filled up a room in seconds) being partially ingulfed in maga wouldnt affect her as long as she keeps making more bubbles (This is why water is used in nuclear powerplants to transfer thermal energy, its super good at it)|
|Yuki Yuki (RIP Monet)|Oven|Its snow. Hes hot I mean like come on how is she gonna hurt him when shes melted?|
|Crocodile |Opera|Crocs biggest weakness is his fruit doesnt work when hes wet blood water doesnt matter. Opera is made out and can summon as much creams he wants.|
|Enel|Luffy|This ones a bit of a stretch|
|Caribou|Morely/(Pika too idk how he would ""possess"" the liquid if its already caribous body)|Oshi Oshi is the giant rev commander's ability, he can push away anything (solid or liquid like) like it was fabric or jelly He uses this mostly for tunneling the exact opposite of how caribou uses his swamp ability to bury people inside him.a|

fs3k94,Firepork08,The East Blue Bias,"I love One Piece a lot but recently I can't help but feel the straw hats introduced in the East Blue saga have a lot of bias towards them from Oda. It's not a major issue and I'm sure it's not a new revelation to most but I do wish Oda would spend more time on some of the newer strawhats.

I think this first really started in Thriller Bark, I always thought Thriller Bark was a tough juggling act for the crew, the previous arc had major developments to two strawhats and introduced a new one and then thriller bark had the job of introducing another one. The crew went through a lot of changes fast and with marineford straight after it wouldn't have the time to develop most of the newer crew. Characters like Franky and Brook didn't have much to do outside their introductory arcs until much later in the story.

After the timeskip most of the arcs seem to have a focus on the East Blue characters, Luffy is an obvious focus and I'm mainly excluding him when discussing this for obvious reasons. But through most of Fishman Island and Punk Hazard I can't think of too much any non East Blue straw hat did. Franky had a little fight in Punk Hazard and Chopper was important for helping the children but they didn't have as much of the spotlight as I would've hoped, Franky was absent most of the arc anyway. 

Dressrosa was definitely a step in the right direction, I was happy when Oda split up the straw hats as it would allow more focus on specific ones and we got that to an extent. Franky finally got something major to do with a 1 on 1 fight with Senor Pink. Robin didn't have anything too major to do however and didn't get a true fight this arc which was disappointing and the straw hat with the most to do (besides Luffy) was probably Usopp. So while this was a step in the right direction I still feel like it was a problem.

Whole Cake Island is one of my favourite arcs but even though it split up the team it feels like the biggest offender for this. Brook does get some cool moments to be fair but the arc clearly has a central focus around Sanji, with Nami and Luffy having most of the spotlight. I can't remember anything major Chopper does in this arc either. 

With how Wano is progressing I can't help but feel like this will still be an issue in this arc. I want more arcs that are focused around specific characters like Water 7 and Whole Cake but have a bigger focus around characters that often feel forgotten like Franky and Robin.

I wanted to see what everyone else thought and if it was just me feeling this and maybe some ideas about how non east blue characters could be incorporated more into the story.",3,1585617473,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fs3k94/the_east_blue_bias/,OnePiece,1

fs2to8,throwaway128919,Does current garp have yonko level strength?,"Unless everything said about him is an exaggeration I don‚Äôt see how he‚Äôs not.

The reason I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an exaggeration is because Garp hasn‚Äôt been assassinated or kicked out of the navy. 

Tom was a criminal simply because he built Rogers ship. And it was mentioned that the world government wanted to erase everything related to Roger. But Garp not only took in Ace but hid him from the WG and is the grandfather of the 5th emperor. He‚Äôs also Dragons father(presumably) who is the most wanted man in history. 
  The WG has every reason to kill Garp for the things he has done but he‚Äôs still able to not only live but remain a marine. 

As far as strength. He was said to be Rogers rival multiple times. The only other person to be considered Rogers rival was whitebeard. And he helped defeat the rocks pirates. Who had both Kaido and big mom. 
  If Garp was the only other rival to Roger than he had to be equal to whitebeard both in there prime and at the war of the best. I can even see the argument that because Garp wasn‚Äôt sick like whitebeard, he could have been a little stronger.

fs24yd,Chriscftb97,[spoilers] Theory about a certain alliance,"So I'm at the part in the manga where Big Mom rampages through the prison camp and Luffy frees himself, so I'm operating off of information up until that point (please refrain from spoiling me on anything further if possible).

______

The alliance I'm talking about is the Hawkins/Kid/Apoo alliance.

So I don't think Hawkins is actually loyal to Kaido. I'm guessing that the alliance was working on a plan to take down Kaido, before Kaido ended up literally falling into their lap.

They all started pretending to work under Kaido. Hawkins got made a headliner, Killer was supposed to become a Gifter, but was given a defective SMILE, Kid was also probably a headliner at some point, before getting fed up and screwing up the plan (a la Luffy). I have no idea what's happening with Apoo, but I assume he's a headliner in one of the cities, or working elsewhere for Kaido.

I'm thinking that the plan is for them to betray Kaido when the time is right, but that will be foiled by Luffy finding out and accidentally outing them, causing everything to erupt into chaos.

_________

I brought this up to a friend of mine, and he suggested that the alliance had meant to target Shanks, but I don't buy it. Kid was already missing his arm before the alliance formed. I think there's some personal beef between Shanks and Kid.

He also went after the Big Mom Pirates, and they were definitely not a target of the alliance.

I personally think that Oda is trying to hint to a connection between Shanks and Kid. Both have red hair, similar scars on their faces, and are both missing an arm.",5,1585612189,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fs24yd/spoilers_theory_about_a_certain_alliance/,OnePiece,1
fs21qs,Yaabu,A smaller mystery Wano still is holding out on for me,"This is minor in the grand scheme of things, but will prove to me the kind of person Big Mom is:

How did she take Katakuri's loss to Luffy? Is she livid? Does she even care? Is she upset that Katakana was hurt in the end? Does she only care that he lost, and we can expect her to respond similarly to how Cracker and ...oh lord the name escapes me. Whom ever lost to Urouge.

Katakuri's words to Luffy at the end of the fight feels as if our Mochi-Boy doesn't hold his mother in much respect. That may give me my answer already. It might be a smaller moment, but knowing Luffy, he may not like to hear what Lin-Lin would have to say about Katakuri. If she insults him in some way Especially if Katakuri some how makes his way to Wano. 

It's really just something I'm curious about, and I know will come up some point, even if in passing.",17,1585611869,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fs21qs/a_smaller_mystery_wano_still_is_holding_out_on/,OnePiece,1
fs1xwn,AHickey1995,Is another Time Skip needed? Is it even feasible at this point?,"So I have been reading up on some of the fan thoughts and theories around the internet, and I came to one conclusion above all else. Luffy and his crew just aren‚Äôt strong enough yet to seriously go head to head with a Yonko, Admiral etc. While I have some serious reservations about that which I will speak on in a bit, it got me thinking, is another ‚Äútraining‚Äù time skip needed to make the store as coherent as possible? 

Now, a time skip is an easy way to power up your characters to a point where they are viable, but it does come with a price. The price is the World your characters live in. At this current time it has been hinted that the world as a whole is closely approaching the ‚Äúdawn.‚Äù From Doffy‚Äôs prison speeches to the Gorosei stating there was a great cleansing in order, it seems like the main characters goals have a door that is quickly closing. If they were to realize they needed extra training (maybe after the battle with Kaido) how long would they be able to actually train? None of the outside factors (BB, WG, Revolutionaries) are on the Straw Hats time schedule, and unlike Kaido and Big Mom who have seemingly been in a Cold War stalemate for 20+ years, they want what they want now.

This doesn‚Äôt even get into the logistical nightmare that is how they could even find a place to train and how they would even train. Firstly, everyone wants to kill the straw hats. Big Mom in particular has shown she will go to the ends of the earth to wipe out the crew. Is there really gonna be another Kuma situation? Wouldn‚Äôt that feel super cheap? Also as Rayleigh said in a flashback to Luffy‚Äôs training, the quickest way to get stronger is to enhance your Haki as you fight. Another time skip focused on training would kind of spit in the face of this statement all together. 

In conclusion I think the answer here is 2 fold. 1. I don‚Äôt think the crew is as weak as people think. Oda has certain ways he likes to hype up his villains and that is by showing them as nearly invincible on first encounters. He does this by first and second hand sources. Usually Luffy gets beat pretty bad by the antagonist, and there is multiple side characters who say the villain is impossible to be. The strawhats overcoming the odds and not caring what other people say about their chances has become something of a theme in the series. 2. I think a time skip is more detrimental to the story than just having the strawhats power up. Oda has more than enough plausible deniability here, as villains consistently underestimate Luffy and the crew. Maybe our perspective on the strength of the crew is tied to the perspective of the villains themselves. They feel like they‚Äôre invincible, so do we. I think a time skip is much more illogical than that.

What do you guys think? How do you think a time skip can actually work?",41,1585611486,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fs1xwn/is_another_time_skip_needed_is_it_even_feasible/,OnePiece,1

fry2ic,witty_potato,How strong is Kidd?,"People often put Kidd nearly equal to luffy, and in terms of strenght he probably is.... untill we bring in Gear 4.

Hear me out.

What if Kidd has great haki and great strength and great conquerors too, but his best form is similar to luffy going Gear 3?

Kidd's go to technique could be a similar form factor and body advantage of Gear 3, but with a huge metal arm...

That way, He would still be among the best, with conquerors and armament haki which is equal to gear 3 luffy, yet not be too OP. 

(If Drake, Mad Monk, Drake, Zoro, Sanji, Killer, etc), all become commander level, or near commander level (because Zoro and sanji will be and many among the 9 scabbard are...), it would seem rather cliche, and would be very difficult to manage all these super powerful characters, among all this mess and later on in the story.

Luffy G3 is already really powerful, with strong armament haki  and huge size and everything, if Kidd has to grow, he can with improvement in armament haki later on...

That could explain how he's among the best, yet he isn't overpowered in any way, thus also giving a chance to individuals like Jimbei, Drake and others to take him on if needed.

If Kidd turns out to have a technique like Gear4, hes going to be too powerful to control and divert him as secondary in the story, he could then single handedly take the centre of attention, with some luck (which is clearly not on his side) and killers help...

This fruit has the ability to instakill the vast majority of people in the verse. The user can manipulate the poison at will, and they can even travel through the poison. And if that wasn't OP enough the use can create an even deadlier poison that is infectious, meaning that it will affect anyone who touches it, creating a chain. The awakening of this fruit is easy to figure out: turning anything you touch into poison! Making you a killing machine.

\#2:Gura-Gura no mi

This fruit allows it's user to create earthquakes and vibrations. The destructive capability is just insane but that's also it's biggest downfall. You basically have to fight in a place where you don't care about and with no one around you, but this fruit is controllable, so there's that. It's not very versatile and it's attacks can be avoided with haki and it's also not an instakill, but it's still pretty darn powerful, in fact two attacks from this fruit were enough to knock down Akainu and split all of MF, so basically anyone who eats this fruit is going to be a top tier.

\#3:Ope-Ope no mi

This df allows you to make a room, and then you can manipulate everything inside the room. That shit is too much bro. You can literally take someone's heart out, and then fuck them. This fruit allowed Law to cut A FUCKING MOUNTAIN. He can change your body with the body of somebody else, which is an instant win since now you're fucked. And he can teleport while inside the room. If you're not convinced go and look at Law vs Smoker. The problem with this fruit is that it takes skill to use it, so not everyone is going to be an instant top tier, but if you master it, IF you become an amazing surgeon of death, nothing can stop...  Well only the plot.

\#4:Nikyu-Nikyu no mi

This gives you paws that allow you to DEFLECT ANYTHING. A fireball? No problem! A shockwave? No problem! Air? No problem!

I mean it is insane. This fruit basically allows you to say ""No I win"" and then you do. You can just push people to the fucking underworld. The only reason is this low is because 1) You only have two paws, leaving you susceptible to being overwhelmed. 2) The fact that you can push stuff doesn't mean you can react to it, so you need good reflex or good CoO because some things are just naturally faster. 3) Not everyone is going to be taken out by your air canons, and most people in the NW are going to be able to dodge them anyways. 4) To win you HAVE to get up close, which can mean your demise if you're fighting someone worthwhile. But this fruit does allow insane mobility, so there's that. Oh you can also take all pain away from your body. . .

\#5:Zushi-Zushi no mi

I felt tempted to put the Kage-Kage no mi here, but it has too many weaknesses that can be very detrimental in a fight and the fruit does take a large amount of skill to use. The Zushi-Zushi no mi, on the other hand, allows you to CONTROL GRAVITY. As far as we know it doesn't have many limits, allowing you fuck everyone in your personal space and LITERALLY SEND THEM TO THE UNDERWORLD. This fruit allows you to float (but since this is a manga, you fly) you control objects, you can call down meteors... YOU CAN CALL DOWN FUCKING METEORS. Since this is OP the meteors are very big but deal very little damage, so just like the Ope-Ope no mi, your only limitation is the plot. You can control the gravity of everything in an island and chibaku tensei everybody. So yeah pretty OP, but the other fruits in this list kinda counter this fruit or allow for a much more immediate effect. Still really strong and I can't wait to see more from my dude Issho!

frufya,kyoopy246,"The morality in One Piece is much more black and white than people make it out to be, and that's ok.","This is a pretty simple post, but it's something that bugs me when the topic comes up in fan discussions. Most of the characters in One Piece can pretty much easily be described as simply good or simply evil and I think that fans try to read much more complexity into the moral fabric of the manga than there actually is. I'm not saying that their motivations or ideals are boring or uninteresting, but even those with very interesting ideas can still pretty much be described as good or evil. A character doesn't need to have grey morality to be well written, and their ideology can be interesting even without that greyness. Let's go over a few examples.


Characters that are obviously GOOD but people pretend are ""grey"":


The Strawhats - These guys are just great. The slightest hint of injustice will put them up in a life or death fight against oppressors. If somebody displays even the slightest bit of compassion towards them they will lay down their lives protecting them. The two bits of evidence people hold against this are that sometimes they steal and that sometimes they kill marines. The stealing is kind of a non-issue for me. They have never stolen from anybody who actually needed the money to survive or be happy, and they've only stolen from people who they just recently SAVED THE LIVES OF. If they show up at a thriving village, save it from absolute devastation, and then take like the golden cup that the mayor owns that's not really evil in my book. The marines I'll get to later, but killing marines is pretty much just fine in my book. Yes Luffy killed a bunch of Impel Down guards. *Did you fucking see Impel Down*? It was a massive torture hell holding political prisoners indefinitely, many of which who were sent there without trial or oversight. Every single person who supported that institution deserves worse than death. 


Law - Like many pirates, Law is the victim of Marine propaganda. He was initially portrayed as some fucked up evil torture doctor, but it's pretty clear he's a fine dude. He specifically uses his devil fruit for non-lethal attacks even in fights to the death and he does so because ""he's a doctor who doesn't like hurting people"" as he said to Hawkins. Even when he took those pirates hearts and gave them to the marines don't you notice how he specifically *stole their hearts*? Using his non-lethal devil fruit? Leaving them alive and relatively unharmed? 


Characters who are obviously EVIL but people pretend are ""grey"":


Akainu: He committed genocide against a race of researchers for looking into secrets of the evil super-dictatorship slavery running authoritarian government that he supports. End of story.


Morgan: He ran a political prison designed for torture who enemies of the evil celestial dragons were sent to without trial. End of story.


Kidd: He crucified innocent pirates begging for mercy. End of story.


Blackbeard: Haven't we gone over genocide already?


I could go on but that's honestly enough for my point. The incredibly clear subtext of One Piece is that the Celestial Dragons control the world and use propaganda to make themselves seem just and everybody else (namely pirates) seem evil. This seems to actually confuse real life readers, who think that the marines are somehow good. The marines are like the fucking SS. Sure sometimes they apprehend real criminals bit usually they just operate as the dogs of a dictatorship. The *only* good marines are all practically traitors. Kuzan deserted. Coby, Garp, Saul, and Fujitora have all disobeyed direct orders from Admirals. If you have to commit treason to stay a good person while working for the marines, it's not a good place. Similarly, pirates are all more like ""rebels"" than murderous criminals. Most of their ""crimes"" are just having the courage to fly against the world government. 

In the end this kind of pretty simply wraps it up. Sure the good characters aren't saints and none of the evil characters are actually satan, but Luffy like stealing some meat from a town while also protecting thousands of innocent people from death doesn't mean he's ""morally grey"" and Akainu slaughtering an entire race of innocent people while like happening to also kill an evil pirate doesn't make him ""morally grey"". That's just an overwhelmingly good person who did a tiny bad thing and then an overwhelmingly evil person who isn't 100% bad in every way.",17,1585587239,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/frufya/the_morality_in_one_piece_is_much_more_black_and/,OnePiece,1

frt6eu,JayZSavedMyWife,Dream I had about the island after Wano,"After Wano the Straw Hats went to this island that had a volcano full of dark green liquid, and it was run in the shadows by a doctor who was associated with Doflamingo's business. Not Caesar but someone new. 

Food was a status symbol to this island's society. People ate at official dining tables and ate the dishes they were allowed to eat according to their reputation. The more well-liked you were, the better the food you could eat, with the highest status being a dining table on a sky island up above the land island. 

Chopper was at that dining table in the sky when Enel showed up. Enel zapped everyone and left, and Chopper handled the aftermath of the situation by cleaning up the table and treating people who got zapped. There was never any reason mentioned for why Enel showed up here, and he didn't show up again after this. 

One of the doctor's crew was taken out by Zoro early on in the arc, but I don't think he was supposed to be Zoro's final opponent. He was a short, speedy thief with a burglar mask that got taken out in one hit while he was running away to report to his boss that the Straw Hats were here. 

At one point I got transported into the One Piece world while I was reading it, and I was sailing backwards on a rowboat through the New World to East Blue through each island the Straw Hats went to in reverse.

[\\""Decks of the World\\"" cover from chapter 631](https://preview.redd.it/e4c3sgem3tp41.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c0d8c13798df9e7cc227642d3dedd77bedb7a44)

When this chapter came, we all knew that this was foreshadowing for the events of Wano. After all, this arc was hyped up since Thriller Bark and we expected it to be heavy in reveals.  


So far, it has been, but there is still one big mystery to uncover, who was this man casually drinking with Crocus? Since we know that the old man was the doctor of the Oro Jackson, seeing him being so friendly with someone clearly led us to believe that this man was part of Roger's crew. So a lot of people assumed he was Gaban and that we would meet him in Wano. But the third and final act of the Wano Arc is now running and Scopper Gabban as yet to appear. This would be weird to include him this late.

Another theory was Shikki, due to the similar coat and haircut but I don't see why Crocus would be so friendly with one of his captain's former enemy (and not a friendly rival like Whitebeard, a true sworn enemy) and from what we know, the Golden Lion has no ties whatsoever with Wano Kuni.

During the second act of Wano, people expected him to be one of the two missing Red Scabbards (at the time, Kawamatsu and Denjiro) but Kawamatsu has been revealed to be a fishman and imprisoned in Udon for years and Denjiro was Kyoshiro (and not Zoro's master, as a lot of people, including me, expected). So it couldn't be either of them.

Others suspected him to be Oden, but we know for a fact that he died, executed by Kaido in front of everyone. Yes, it wouldn't be the first fake out death, but it would be the first to have such unsatisfying implications.

What does it leave us with? At this point, I personally expect this to be a plot line abandoned by Oda (yes, I know, ""Oda never forgets"" but he does create a lot of thing he leaves in a corner to be used in the future. Oda is a genius, but not because he planned everything from the beginning, he is a genius because he's able to ties up a lot of little details into a satisfying continuity with no excessive plot holes) but I could be wrong. There is still a lot of reveals to come from Wano, like Zoro's lineage and his master's ties with Wano's samurais, Jinbei and Katakuri's fate after Whole Cake Island, the results of the CP0's encounter with Orochi and the true nature of Kaido (my money is on the ""Actual Dragon who ate the Oni Oni no Mi"").

frp408,Gayax,Meaning of Im sama's name,"Hi everyone, as many of you I've been intrigued by the name of Im since the character was displayed to our sight in chapters 906,908. The thing is, ""Im"" seems too short to be a real name, and many of you suggested it might be the abbreviation of something. I'd like your opinion on my theory.

**TL;DR** : here's my two cents: ""Im"" --&gt; in english M. --&gt; short for Mary --&gt; Im is Mary Geoise --&gt; in katakana „Éû„É™„Éº„Ç∏„Éß„Ç¢: *Marii Joa* \--&gt; ""Joa"" can be spelled ""Joie"" which means ""Joy"" in french --&gt; **Im's real name is Mary Joy**, and is related to Joy Boy.

How / Why did I come up wit this theory?

* **M.** First, many of you suggested ""Im"" could be an abbreviation. I liked the idea, because ""Im"" doesn't really mean anything, and doesn't follow One Piece name patterns (either western or japanese). But the theory claiming Im is the abbreviation of Jesus' speech ""I am"" ([John 8:56‚Äì59](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teshub)) seemed to far-feteched. Ditto for the theory that Im refers to the ancient god [Teshub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teshub) (Im being the cuneiform version / spelling of Teshubbs name) from the hurrian civilization. I didn't see why Oda would add biblical/hurrian stuff to his cocktail, since he already explicitly chose to follow the greek mythology with Uranus/Neptune/Pluton. Whereas the cunning master Oda actually enjoys twisting western words in their katana renderings to cover his track. For instance, the Raftel/Laugh Tale thing left us all a bit perplexed. This made me believe that ""Im"" could actually just be a twisted version of the letter ""M."". Why M? Well, because Mary.
* **Mary**. Yes, as in Mary Geoise. Because otherwise, who the hell would that ""Mary"" be? We know Oda doesn't choose names randomly. We saw this for instance with Blackbeard's ship ""Saber of Xebec"", that finally turned out to be a reference to Rocks D. Xebec. Oda likes to do this kind of stuff, putting a hint hidden in plain sight, to uncover its true meaning a few hundred chapters later. So I think ""Im"" could actually be a rendering of ""M."", the abbreviation of ""Mary"". Why did ""Mary"" become ""M.""? Well, think about it. As far as we can guess, this weird being has probably been around for the past 800 hundred years (since the void century), so it's likely their name has long been forgotten, and simply turned to a vague reference to what is once was : a simple ""M."". But by vanity, Im decided to christen the capital ""Mary Geoise"", certain no one would wonder who Mary is. But here we are: who's that Mary person?!
* **Mary Geoise**. Once more, I'm building on others' theories here. Many of you argued Im could be a female, due to her svelte appearance, eyes, and enjoyment of flowers and butterflies. This got me thinking: What if ""Im"" is ""M."", the ""Mary"" of ""Mary Geoise""? This could have profound implications. In the katana version, it's spelled *Marii Joa* („Éû„É™„Éº„Ç∏„Éß„Ç¢). Now, ""Joa"" can also be spelled ""Joie"", which is still pronounced *Joa*, and is the french translation of Joy. It's plausible when we go back to Oda's love of word-twisting. Joie = Joy. Rings a bell huh, doesn't it?

Final thoughts : Im could be Mary Joy, and be related to Joy Boy (as other suggested). Maybe it's Joy Boy him/herself, maybe it's Joy Boy's sister. We don't know. I still think it's interesting to notice, and plausible enough to be posted here.

frorg3,earlsofwisdom,King's devil fruit reveal was really underwhelming.,"Here is why I hate his fruit

* Pteranodons are fucking lame! They're low tier flying trash! They're not even dinosaurs! 
* Oda should have given the Pteranodon fruit to someone in the Flying Six! The Flying Six are fodder compared to the All-Stars but yet the Flying Six have much better fruits than King!
* King already has wings so why give him a flying zoan fruit? Was it just so he can have 4 wings in his hybrid? If Oda really wanted him to be Rodan then he shouldn't have given him natural wings.

&amp;#x200B;

Why couldn't Oda make King  a T-Rex? Can you just imagine a flying T-Rex covered in flames? The T-Rex is probably going to be the leader of the Flying Six when it should have been given to King...

Only reason the fans have accepted King's fruit is because the fire gives it the illusion that he is a mythical. Maybe its my fault? I convinced myself he was going to have a mythical devil fruit. The entire fanbase were confident that he was going to be a mythical. 

I remember all those fan theories that as King is a devil, demon, wyver, hellhound, Tengu etc.",17,1585566347,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/frorg3/kings_devil_fruit_reveal_was_really_underwhelming/,OnePiece,1

fro48g,Eadwine_,What's next for Germa 66?,"I can't be the only one curious, right?

It's still unknown what happened to them during the escape from Totto Land. Last we saw them they were fighting the Big Mom Pirates and seemed overwhelmed. Present-time Big Mom has made no mention of Germa or Jimbei in her crusade in Wano, but for all we know they all might be captured and brought along as bait/leverage.

However I assume that both parties made it out of Totto Land safely and are licking their wounds.

Now, I think Judge might be considering making some changes to Reiju, Ichiji, Niji and Yonji. He always saw compassion, empathy, sympathy, and all those other positive attributes as hindrances in combat and not needed. Yet when they all were captured during the wedding none of the siblings cared about getting fooled and dying, and no one made any effort to free themselves. They basically gave up. Judge oh-so-ironically asked what was wrong with them.

Shortly after Sanji saves them all, aka the ""failure of Germa"". The one child of Judge who is normal. Obviously Judge is a very prideful man but I think even he can see now that Sanji isn't the failure of Germa, he is.

I think the next time we see the Germa siblings they will be radically different people and not assholes anymore (though Reiju never was).",4,1585563089,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fro48g/whats_next_for_germa_66/,OnePiece,1

frnx0x,DVnyT,Power rankings in One Piece,"Not flairing as analysis as I think I was biased quite a bit, and discussions seems to be more inclusive. Manga spoilers for 975, of course.

Power rankings in One Piece are hard. Mostly because the characters don't just brawl it out in 1 vs 1s most of the time. With the Big Mom-Kaido alliance in the making, and the story really taking a turn into its last lap, I figured it was a good time to speculate these power rankings.¬†



Before reading my analysis, you can go take a look at two polls I posted a while ago, about the topics I felt the community was most divided on. I think the traffic on those posts has pretty much peaked, so I don't think there'd be major changes.

Links-

Admirals vs Yonkou

https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/frlc8r/ye_ole_admirals_vs_yonkou_debate/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share


Mihawk vs Fujitora

https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/frlyex/mihawk_the_hardest_guy_to_properly_rank/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share


I didn't comment on either polls since I was just looking to gather data. Just hours into the first poll at least, the comment section turned into a slugfest.

What I understood from both the polls AND the comment sections of a lot of YouTube clips that I watched the past month, was that quite some people based their opinions on anime portrayals. For example- Akainu being absolutely terrified of WB in Marineford was an anime scene. Nowhere in the manga was Akainu seen sweating when Shanks arrived at Marineford.¬†

This isn't to say that having to fight against 2 Yonkou would be easy, but I believe the slight changes in character expressions, changing the pace of a fight etc. can easily change how we view that character. We saw how the community reacted to the Kaido vs Luffy fight in the anime. For an anime- only watcher, he would think Luffy actually stood a chance. Similarly, I feel most pacing changes, like when Fujitora smashes the gambling cheaters into the ground in Dressrosa, or when Mihawk's whole contribution in Marineford seemed to be to parry Vista, absolutely destroy the dynamic of their power rankings.¬†

Again, then there are a shit ton of issues with Marineford in general. Both sides were 'going easy' or not 'fighting to their fullest potential' so as to not hurt their allies. The problem is that we don't know the extent of the powers they WEREN'T using. For half the people, Akainu blew up half of Whitebeard's face off, for the other half, Akainu got oneshotted by WB. For anime watchers, they don't even know about WB's face being blown off.¬†

As a preface to the analysis, I request y'all to try and listen.¬† Let's have calm discussions in the comment sections.


So here goes.


First off, the World Government. Out of the 3 powers of the world, it's the only one with organization. I don't believe the Gorosei and Im-sama are really proficient in combat. Most of them do look quite old and crafty, with their main goal being to stop anyone from reaching Laughtale and uncovering the Government's secrets. For 800 years, they have done so, seeing as how Roger and crewmates haven't canonically leaked that information to anyone yet (and how big-mouth Buggy D. Joker never actually set foot on Laughtale.)


The biggest contenders for the One Piece at this point in the story, are Linlin, Kaido and Blackbeard. (Note that Shanks isn't interested in the One Piece, and Luffy isn't a big enough threat comparatively, from the perspective of the WG.)

The Gorosei are smart because they've guarded said secret for 800 years somehow. (I know they weren't alive for 800 years, but you get the point.)

You could probably argue that the very fact that Roger got to Laughtale during the reign of the current Gorosei doesn't speak volumes of their intelligence. Though we don't know a lot of what went down 20 years ago, the WG at the time probs had their hands full, between covering up the Rocks pirates, and how the Marines fought alongside Roger, to fighting Shiki (note that Shiki is canon in the story, but Strong World probably isn't.)

Regardless, they would have thought about a worst case scenario. They should have, at least. Teaming up with 2-bit, backstabbing pirates isn't exactly negotiation. They had to have considered the what ifs of a pirate alliance. Big Mom-Kaido was probably still a bit of a surprise, considering how it came at the worst possible time for the Marines. The Marines are powerful because it is an ORGANISATION. It's because, if the Yonkou were to step out of line, The Marines could, should, in theory, take them down and cull the threat of finding the One Piece. The current admirals are strong by virtue, and even if they weren't as strong as they are, they could probably still maintain the balance of the world, simply because they are an organisation.¬†

With the Big Mom-Kaido alliance, we have yet to see the Gorosei's reaction, but Akainu calls it a 'disaster', not because they are weak, but because they are already understaffed with the Reverie at the time and then busy with the abolishment of the Shichibukai taking up Fujitora and other Marines. (Note that Borsalino and Sakazuki are still in Marineford/Mary Geiose, and we don't know about Greenbull's whereabouts.)

Borsalino suggests going to Wano by himself, accompanied by a fleet, and Sakazuki shuts down the idea, probably to wait it out a bit, or, more likely, a story twist so that the strawhats don't have to deal with another monster in Wano.¬†

We can't really pin the 1 vs 1 powers of Borsalino by this statement alone, but the guy doesn't seem like Luffy, who nosedives into fights he cannot win. Slow as he is, Kizaru would still weigh his options right. He doesn't have balls of iron to go and stop the alliance, he simply has the strength to at least bring about some sort of shift in dynamic, by either reducing their crews to rubble, or to guerilla- like inflict some injuries when the two are distracted, or scare them diplomatically somehow. But the sheer confidence of the guy is enough to at least give him credit for being able to stand up to a Yonkou, especially Kaido, and that confidence doesn't come without the strength to back it up. Kaido wouldn't one shot or 2HKO Kizaru like he did Luffy. Opinion alert; I believe Kizaru would at least be able to hold his own for most of the fight. He probably would lose, but not before doing some damage. Opinion; over.


Now, the other controversial thing, the arrest of Dracule Mihawk. Most people, having seen how passive Fuji was in Dressrosa, and even how Doffy literally threatens him on the spot, AND how he didn't even manage to quickly finish Sabo off, or how even Zoro was able to parry swords with him, disregard Fuji as the weakest admiral among the current 3. The problem is, we haven't seen much of Fuji in action (and he hasn't seen much of us, lol.)

His decisions in Dressrosa aren't something to go off of, because his motives there were driven by his intention to abolish the Shichibukai system, to display to the world how immoral the whole thing was in the first place. Please note, that out of all the people in this world, the WG would recognise threats way more appropriately than us readers. The very fact they send Fuji to arrest Mihawk speaks volumes about his strengths. They wouldn't send their admiral on a suicide mission is Fuji wasn't actually strong enough to take him down. I'm not taking anything away from Mihawk, but just objectively, it HAS to make sense that Fuji would have some edge over Mihawk to be able to arrest/ subdue him. If Mihawk were to just cut down the ships sent to arrest him, the WG wouldn't have sent ONLY Fuji. They know about Mihawk's duels with Shanks, they know about all the hype and the badassery, and yet they choose to only send Fuji with a fleet. Note, of course, that the fleet wouldn't be fighting Mihawk directly anyway, the guy's strong enough to cut down ships and litter the waters with planks of wood, no doubt. But there must be some thought put into sending Fuji to arrest the guy, right?¬†


Onto the Kizaru vs Rayleigh debate. Kizaru, an admiral pre-TS, one of the monsters of the Marines, got scratched by 78 year old (I did read an SBS, though, I don't remember the exact age,) Dark king Rayleigh, and couldn't even defeat him. Let's take a look at another fight like this which I believe draws many parallels. Zoro vs Boss Kyoshiro. Zoro was driven to kill Orochi as he saw the guy shoot Yasuie. His motive was to kill Orochi. And who stopped him? Kyoshiro. The guy who is 20 years older than Kinemon, who is a literal joke in terms of strength compared to Zoro as we saw in Punk Hazard and Dressrosa. He managed to SOMEHOW stop Zoro. Please note, that Kinemon was one of the strongest Nine Red Scabbards/Sheaths, IMO, definitely stronger than Denjiro in his prime, and somehow, SOMEHOW, this weaker than Kinemon (even if we consider him an equal in terms of strength, he is 20 years older,) swordsman stopped Zoro, leading Zoro to say, 'This guy is strong'. All of us know for a fact, that if the fight had continued, Zoro would win. But the reason Kyoshiro stopped him was because Zoro's motive was Orochi and Kyoshiro's motive was Zoro.¬†


If we draw parallels to this fight, Borsalino's motive was to kill/injure the Worst Gen, and Rayleigh's motive was to stop Borsalino. In both cases, Kizaru and Zoro were distracted by a target who was getting away, with an annoying speedbreaker in the way. The guy who one shots a large ass mangrove tree should've beat Rayleigh in a test of strength. It would be really difficult, but it would happen. The fight is more about praising Rayleigh's strength, than showing Borsalino's weakness. The first commander of the Roger pirates would have to be strong of course. His captain had a bounty of 5.5 billion. He would have to be strong to compare. Big mom's 4.4 billion, to Katakuri's 1.5 billion, should easily translate to Rayleigh being a really strong opponent, even at his age.¬†

While we are on the topic of age, I do believe I read an SBS where Oda said that age is not a major factor in one's strength, but I can't really find it.¬†


I've been trying to avoid Marineford, but it's kinda essential to talk about, since it's the only reference point we have to a major fight in the One Piece universe. About WB's condition, I do believe that he was still the strongest man at the start of the fight at least, until Squall's betrayal and his heart attacks. WB's strength compared to Kaido and the other Yonkou is kind of hard to understand. If we say that Primebeard went toe to toe with Roger, I think that in all his injuries and age, he would have weakened down to being the strongest Yonkou, but some would disagree, saying he was the weakest at time of the war. Note that Shanks parried an attack from WB pre TS, with an attack that split the heaven. The same WB couldn't one shot Akainu. So it's either that Akainu is actually way stronger than we give him credit for, or WB's strength had deteriorated quite a lot by Squall and other factors in the war.¬† Really don't know which is which, up for debate, I guess. Then there's Akainu blowing half of WB's face off.¬†

One thing I don't really like about the people in the comment sections is the insane double standards. The same people who say that Mihawk wasn't trying when his attack was blocked by Jozu, are the people saying Borsalino is weak AF because he couldn't defeat Marco. C'mon people, give WB's crew some credit. They aren't your run of the mill Yonkou crewmates. Some of these guys fought against guys like Rayleigh and Gaban in their prime. And yes, Marco was a kid at the time, but we see how Shanks turned out as an apprentice.¬†

About the Red- Haired pirates arrival. No, Akainu wasn't as scared as the anime portrayed him to be. He is as much of a warmongerer as Kaido, so given the chance he would have fought against Shanks too, but please note that Sengoku officially called the war off. Sakazuki wasn't stupid enough to go against his fleet admiral, and more importantly, he had suffered a direct blow from WB. It's not like he parried the hit at the end. You know what he did parry though? An attack from WB from before, with his legs alone. You know who else parried an attack from WB? Shanks.


Alright, alright. I got a bit too opinionated there. But the fact remains. People underrate the admirals way more than they overrate them. Sure, an admiral probably won't be able to defeat a Yonkou, but they should be able to hold their own in such 1 vs 1s.¬†


About the Akainu vs Aokiji fight. It's quite the incredible feat to be able to change the climate of a place. The battle between Garp+Roger vs the Rocks pirates didn't manage to do something of this scale, not that we know of anyway.¬†

Even if we were to ignore this comparison, the very fact that Aokiji's ice somehow hasn't melted in over 2 years when it is literally so close to magma, just speaks volumes about the strength of their devil fruits.¬†


Opinion alert ; Hmm, by now you probably deem me to be an admiral fanboy. But, it's just how I interpret balance to be in the One Piece universe. What prevented the Shichibukai from just turning against the WG? The easiest instance to do this would have been in Marineford. If Mihawk is supposed to be Yonkou level, and the Marines couldn't possibly defend against 2 Yonkou, why wouldn't Mihawk just turn against the WG? Because he isn't that kind of character? Because it would break the story? What about Doffy? He seems like the perfect guy to turn on the WG right? Especially after seeing Boa do so to save Luffy. Like Linlin said. They could just 'take over the world, then kill each other afterwards'. It wasn't like the swordsman Mihawk was looking for was in the Marines.¬†

By sheer circumstance of being the main antagonists of the series, they should be strong, even though we haven't seen enough out of them.¬†

I tried to be as objective as I could to present my perspective, but I probably failed in that aspect. Regardless, be sure to debate stuff.¬†

And yes, Fuji vs Sabo seemed like an even fight. But Fuji+ Greenbull was able to beat and *kill* Sabo and all of the revolutionary army that was present at the Reverie, which I assume had some executives who we've seen previously to be pretty strong too.


So in all my biased fashion, here goes the top 10 power rankings of the people currently alive and not arrested yet in One Piece, in decreasing order of RAW strength.


World's strongest creature, Viceroy of the Hundred Beasts Pirates, Kaido

Fleet Admiral Akainu Sakazuki

Admiral Kizaru Borsalino

Captain of the Big Mom Pirates, Charlotte Linlin

Captain of the Red- Haired Pirates, Shanks

Ex-Admiral Aokiji Kuzan

Admiral Fujitora Issho

World's strongest swordsman, Dracule 'Hawk-eyes' Mihawk

Admiral of the Blackbeard Pirates, Marshall D. Teach

Hundred Beasts Pirates All-star, King


Note that I have ignored Sengoku, Garp, and Greenbull in the above list, since we don't know enough about them. While I am a bit conflicted on the positions of Kuzan and Borsalino, I think the other admirals are placed correctly.¬†

Again, would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on things that I missed/ was very biased about. Of course, as someone who loves the story to death, I'm gonna have some biases, so thank you for taking the time to read, even if you disagree.¬†

frmrzg,Barkle11,Why dont characters communicate properly? (no spoilers please),"Im on episode 239 so please no spoilers afterwards please. 

So far , there has been numerous occasions where characters dont communicate with each other and it leads to fight for no damn reason. Example 1: luffy fights zoro for ""murdering"" the people of the cactus land. Example 2: just watched this, the ship wrights fight luffy for no goddamn reason and luffy doesnt say anything like ""why are you fighting me? what did i do?"" Even if sometimes a character does say something, the other one just fights/argues with them for some odd reason without having ANY facts. Its like they are retarded?.

Does this persist throughout the series? compared with other series, this stuff never happens. In naruto for example, some character wouldnt just walk and beat the fuck out of someone because they think they are bad based on a whim . It just seems like a waste of time, and its kinda annoying.

Dracule ""Hawk-eyes"" Mihawk. Badass as he is, he is often considered at Yonkou level, simply due to the fact that he dueled Shanks without a clear victor. Bringing to attention the fact that Shanks wasn't a Yonkou at time of their duels and also how the duels probably weren't fights to death, considering the kind of characters the both of them are, (Shanks being mostly easygoing and Mihawk also viewing Shanks as more of a crewmate than a rival. We see this relationship when Mihawk comes to show Shanks the new bounties and Shanks just offers him sake.)

frliy3,raobj280,What scene/battle are you looking forward to the most in Wano?,"If you only had to pick one thing you are most excited for in Wano (like a battle or moment/scene) I know that is tough cause it seems Wano will be a legendary arc, maybe even the best arc of one piece after it ends. For me my fav arc is Water 7/Enies Lobby and I think Wano will top it. 

I think for me I am most looking forward to Sanji and Zoro's 1 on 1 fights they are going to have this arc. I am very certain it will either be Queen vs. Sanji or Queen vs. Zoro and vice versa (king facing whoever does not get Queen) I can't wait for these moments especially because we have not really seen Sanji or Zoro go all out since the time-skip. 

Getting to see these 2 guys of the Monster Trio having to face their strongest opponents since water 7 will be incredible, AND on top of that we are gonna see new moves from these 2 like an upgraded diable jamble/plus new raid suit design from Franky and raid suit powers and demon ashura/emna badassery from zoro. 

I know our favorite scene could be something we never saw coming, but any scenes you expect to happen that you are most hyped about? Like shit I could change my mind tomorrow cause there are so many possibilities. Here are some other great answers some people could have: Jinbei appearing, Marco/whitebeard pirates showing up, grand fleet showing up, luffy vs. kaido, red scabbards vs. the numbers/kaido, apoo vs. brook/kidd, Momonosuke having a pivotal moment showing some strength/leadership and/or using his DF in a fight, seeing Orochi getting Spandam'd , luffy gear 5, sorry I could go on and on but I have been weeby enough already.",21,1585548877,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/frliy3/what_scenebattle_are_you_looking_forward_to_the/,OnePiece,1

However, when she was rediscovered by the navy in Enies lobby; she‚Äôs grown stronger combat wise; she joined a crew that picked a fight with the world government and took down CP9; she beat up and attempted to murder a high official of said cipher pol. 

With all of that after Enies lobby she increased her bounty by 1,000,000.

frjppb,Silver-Fang-Bang,Supernova,"How much stronger would Luffys crew be if it was comprised of the worst generation (minus Blackbeard ) rather then the straw hats.

1. Luffy would still be Captain 

2. Zoro let‚Äôs say swordsman / first mate. The way he joined Luffy could still be the same 

This is where I not sure how the order would be exactly so the numbers don‚Äôt represent the number I which they would join the crew I‚Äôm just using the number of the straw hat with the same job to list them here. 

3. X Drake as navigator he is loyal to Luffy completely so none of that, but I think he would have fast knowledge of the ocean consider his marine past. 

- So huge improvement combat wise over nami in my opinion yeah she has pretty good attack power but she is a glass cannon 

4. Capone as sniper, he has already proven to be quite the marksmen and with his ability his arsenal and firepower make him super dangerous with his durability is top notch 

- Probably not as good of a sniper as Usopp but I think he is over all more powerful

5. Bonney obviously as cook, she is a glutton has to know her way around a kitchen when she eats that much

- Weaker then Sanji but has a pretty OP devil fruit and good movement make good for fodder disposing

6. Law may actually be a better doctor then Chopper or at least on the same level his devil fruit makes it hard to be a better doctor to him 

- Law is OP huge combat improvement over Chopper 

7. Hawkins I don‚Äôt what make me think he would be best choice for archeologists but I think he would 

- I think yeah stronger then Robin yes her devil fruit is great for fodder but against a powerful enemy 1 v 1 Hawkins would stand a better chance against someone like Page 1 or Oven a higher up in a Yonko crew 

8. Kids devil fruit scream shipwright I mean if he had knowledge 

- No real feat and Franky is a beat but I gotta say kid is beast and an improvement in a fight over Franky 

9. Apoo musician no explanation needed 

- Him and Brook that close but his devil fruit has range and he might be stronger then brook I‚Äôm sure his music fruit has one crazy abilities oda came up with to make music bad ass

10. Urouge helmsman big and physically strong 

- Weaker then Jinbe but he did defeat a sweat commander so maybe not to much weaker 

11. Killer is a bonus like assassin of the crew of a look out from the crows nest.



In this I imagine them in the polar tang it metal so kid could work on it better then would be pretty notorious so help avoid marines. They would also be a little more hardcore at least Luffy would have to be to keep the crew in Line but after Gear 4th and advanced Haki I don‚Äôt think they can compete with him but I think reality the recognize Luffy as superior.

But how much stronger would the crew be in your opinion I think the warlords (exemption of Mihawk) would be no problem for this crew granted they were taken on individually.

And I think they can defeat Yonko commander individually or at least in teams of two

fripm2,Vinny1012,Why are the Marines after the Strawhats?,"So I recently got my friend into one piece, and around the time he finished alabasta he messaged me asking why the Marines are after the Strawhats, even though they hadn't done anything illegal besides calling themselves pirates. He says that they could've avoided conflict with the Marines by calling themselves sailors instead. I explained that their goal is to be a famous pirate crew, and that being a pirate to them represents the ultimate freedom. The reason why the Marines are after them is because they threaten the world governments agenda, and in the eyes of the Marines there's only black and white. There's no grey areas meaning if you're a pirate then your a bad guy and if your a marine you're a good guy. He's still not convinced though, and I'm honestly a little perplexed myself. I'm caught up to one piece so I know that they do commit acts against the wg, but around the time they liberated alabasta from crocodile what had they really done to Garner the attention of the wg. They took down alvida, buggy, kuro, krieg, arlong, and crocodile, but isn't that in the wg best interest? Aside from assaulting the corrupt marine working with Arlong I can't see why the Marines would be after them, unless they got a rule where they'll Chase down and attack any ship with jolly roger.",18,1585535934,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fripm2/why_are_the_marines_after_the_strawhats/,OnePiece,1
friovy,lifeofjwp,Yonko Theme and significance of each arc,"I just realized that the Yonko and theme focus on the abilities in the one piece world: 

1. Big Mom (Paramecia Devil fruit)
2. Kaido (Zoan Devil Fruit)
3. Blackbeard (Logia Devil Fruit)
4. Shanks (Haki)

The Yonko power tends to focus on the devil fruit with the exception of Shanks. In the whole cake island, Big Mom's crew mainly consists of Paramecia users (ex: Katakuri, Cracker, Smoothie, etc). Currently in Wano, Kaido's crew are Zoan users (ex: Jack, Queen, King, etc). Shanks doesn't have a devil fruit power but he does have strong Haki, which many people speculate that he has advanced Haki. His crew to our knowledge doesn't have devil fruit powers (ex: Benn Beckman, Yasopp, Lucky Roux, etc). 

Blackbeard is unique because not only does he have the strongest Logia fruit but the strongest Paramecia fruit as well. I feel that after Wano he will acquire the strongest Zoan fruit, which belongs to Kaido currently. His crew so far has displayed all three devil fruits: Paramecia (Shiryu), Zoan (possibly Laffitte), and Logia (Kuzan because he's now an ally of the crew). 

In addition, throughout these arcs Luffy tends to strengthen his Haki. In the whole cake island arc, he strengthens his observation Haki. Currently in the Wano arc, he strengthened his armament Haki. The next arc, he will strengthen his conquerer's Haki. With these Haki upgrades, he does gain a new ability in his devil fruit so far. Whole cake island (Snake Man), Wano (possibly Tiger Man that's just a guess), and the future arc (maybe gear 5 or his devil fruit awakening).

frgxhf,arongkatz,Does One Piece suffer from the Dragon Ball Z sickness?,"Hello everybody!

So im basically new to One Piece, Im on episode 123 i know I have some road to go. I got into One Piece because I traveled to Japan and saw for myself how popular it was, I also visited some attractions based on the anime and I loved it¬¥s flair so I decided to jump into the series.

But Im a little concerned about it¬¥s development since I was a big time fan of Dragon Ball but according to my personal taste, Dragon Ball was superb and when it went into DBZ everything got ruined. Why? well I found it more fun and interesting when the good guys found interesting ways to defeat the bad guys not just by being powerful, and also you could see that other characters beside Goku could really kick some ass. All that dissapeared when DBZ arrived and all battles could be won by just learning a new technique and by training. I know there are so many fans that love this formula but I found it too predictible and Im afraid that this could be the same thing for One Piece.  As of now I find it very cool that Luffy has fought with the main villains and most of the time he can  find an interesting way to find their weakness, he¬¥s not invincible, and also you can see some good battles with the rest of the cast, even with Usopp and Nami!. I love this honestly, I mean what was the last time Krilin or Yamcha put up an interesting fight beside the last tournament on DBS? All you see is Goku or Vegeta doing the cool work.

So anyone that is up to date on the episodes, what can you tell me? Did One Piece suffer from this disease? Or it still respecting the way it worked before on todays episodes and sagas?

frgnk0,BiboReyes,"""Canon"" and Anime/Movie Continuity","Hello! First post in this sr; please be kind! (No spoilers for past Amazon Lily, please!!)

I'd like to address the paradigm of ""canon"" in the OP community. I get it; long story short, manga and some peripherals are ""canon"", everything else is not. The thing is, I have no intention of reading the manga, and am strictly an *anime* fan. When I was gearing up for my binge a few months ago, I of course first did research regarding what movies, specials, etc. to and not to watch. The problem is, literally every single resource dismisses the movies as ""non-canon"".

I get it; if it's not by Oda, and not from the source material, it's not ""official"". I suppose the rules are different for manga/anime, but please understand that, to many fans who are not necessarily *manga* fans or *otaku*, dismissing everything else as non-canon is tantamount to, for example, categorically labelling the **Marvel Cinematic Universe** ""non-canon"". Sure, it's the not within the original *comics* continuity, (which is it's own canonical mess) but the MCU is its **own** canon with its **own** continuity.

I feel this is simply a semantics issue, pertaining to how fandoms utilize terms like ""canon"" and ""continuity"", but I digress.

My point is, I simply needed to know if the movies were part of the *ANIME* canon, as in the *ANIME'S continuity*. I'd like to think this is a fairly rational concern; the movies and anime are of the same medium, hence expecting some correlation or overlap is justified. Despite that, all I ever got was ""NOT MANGA NOT CANON NEXT,"" to put it bluntly. This was unhelpful, and provided me no resources to curate my binge.

That's all I have to bring up: that I wish the fandom could set aside what is ANIMATED and reasonably within one fairly airtight continuity as its *own* canon, and curate a ""pseudo-official""-slash-widely-accepted list of pertinent viewing. With that said...

&amp;#x200B;

**---------------------------------If you're interested in how I** ***did*** **eventually determine what to watch, do read on, as I'd appreciate your input.---------------------------------**

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some criteria I followed in curating my binge. This may trigger some folks, as I like to make up rules as I go along, but I'm confident the rationales should suffice for anyone who's even bothered to read this far in. For brevity's sake, allow the term ""canon"" to subsequently, in this post, mean ""***anime*** **canon**,"" which is to say, within anime continuity or ""required"" viewing.

1. Please note that I'm a *completionist*, and so right off the bat, ALL **filler arcs** are canon.
2. **Viewing order** is merely determined by **release date**, EXCEPT for Movie 9  (*Episode of Chopper*), which was retconned in and thus taken as a 2014 release.
3. ***Ganzack*** is like a pilot/protoype, so it's NOT canon.
4. Inconsistencies in **appearance/character design** are forgivable, for the most part. See: Captain Yorki changing design within the same setting in the anime itself.
5. If any Special/OVA/Movie directly contradicts or **""breaks""** any plot-related aspects of the anime (who/what/when/where), then it's NOT canon. Following this, Movies 3 (*Chopper's Kingdom*) and 8 (*Alabasta*) are NOT canon.
6. TV Specials (this is a quirky rule but bear with me): If it **features an anime OP**, then it should be taken as an ""extra"" anime episode, and is canon. I know that at least the first four specials fall under this.
7. If a special/OVA/movie **shares continuity with ANY anime episodes**, then that's canon as well. *Romance Dawn Story* (2008) falls under this now. Boss Luffy has anime episodes, so it's canon too, albeit in another reality.
8. If it DOESN'T have plot-breaking aspects, but **occurs within the anime's world** and is in animated form, then it's canon.
9. Movies and Specials that are just **RECAPS**, as they are either contradictory or lacking compared to the original anime arcs, to some may be canon *per se*, but aren't *required* in my view and thus non-canon. Particularly because, well, you've seen them already anyway. Movie 9 (*Episode of Chopper*) is an exception to this since it was retconned to have been a character's actual dream much later in the story. \[I would like to note that I'm open to changing my stance on this one, since apparently *Episode of East Blue* has an original wrap-up in the end. New material would have to be significant, though, so I'd appreciate insight from those who've seen them.\]
10. **Shorts** that occur in a ""cartoon/Looney Tunes"" world, like the sports ones that are attached to movies, while I suppose are not in continuity, ARE canon is they were attached to a *movie* that counts as canon. (The soccer one isn't canon since it came with movie 3.) Think of this as you would have seen the short anyway if you'd gone to see the canon movie. Call it ""required incidental viewing,"" if that helps. Another weird one but hey, I warned you haha
11. **Fourth wall breaks** that aren't previews are not canon. So *Infiltration! Thousand Sunny!* is, sadly, not canon.
12. One solid argument for the case of some movies being canon is that they manage to **fill in gaps** in the anime, like Gear Second and the Perfect Clima-Tact.
13. The **Toriko** crossovers share story with anime episodes, and so are canon.

&amp;#x200B;

Following all these criteria, I've determined this list as the most adequate ""animated continuity"" collection for my personal preference:

* **Anime**
* **Toriko**
   * Episodes 1, 51, &amp; 99
* **Movies**
   * Movies 1-2, 4-7, and 9-onwards
* **TV Specials**
   * SP 1-4
   * Episode of Luffy
   * ~~3D~~2Y
   * Episode of Sabo
   * Adventure of Nebulandia
   * Heart of Gold
* **OVAs**
   * Romance Dawn Story
   * Strong World, Z, &amp; Gold Preludes
* **Shorts**
   * Jango's Dance Carnival
   * Take Aim! The Pirate Baseball King\*
   * One Piece 3D! Trap Coaster\*\*

And there you have it! I would greatly appreciate it if you could point out if I missed anything based on the parameters above. Otherwise, if you found this helpful (if only in dispensing the information that it's really just Movies 3 and 8 that have plot-breaking inconsistencies), I hope you enjoy!

Thanks for reading!

frg5el,jan_67,Robin‚Äòs devilfruit powers in the newest episode,"In the new episode they expanded the Robin vs Ninja scene a bit. 
In the manga Robin lets her clone disappear just after getting some non-lethal hits, while in the anime version she takes some more, seemingly gets cut everywhere, even having wounds on her face.

When it skips to the real robin, she is unharmed.

Back then in alabasta it was shown that cutting Robins arms leads to her body being wounded too, and while the manga left it open if it still is an weakness of her and a great weakness of her body clone move, the anime basically showed that this is not the case.

Who knows if robin will ever get in another situation where Oda wants to use this point, but the anime kinda changed this weakness of Robin

Because personally I don‚Äôt think Oda forgot this detail, in the manga he clearly always showed Robins clone disappearing before taking lot of visible damage. So either he wanted to leave this open if it works like that or he wanted to show that Robin knows about the weakness and doesn‚Äôt let her body clone hurt that much.

Just want to know what you think, does Robins clone transfers wounds to her body like originally in the manga, and the anime just made a mistake with that scene, or do you think Oda will roll with this new fact that her clones basically can be beaten up and killed without harm for real Robin?",17,1585526031,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/frg5el/robins_devilfruit_powers_in_the_newest_episode/,OnePiece,3

That's how Blackbeard stolel Whitebeard's gura gura no mi: he killed him and then used his power to pull the Akuma no mi's entity  out of Whitebaerd's body putting it into himself.

I finally feel like I have enough to make this theory thanks to the reveal in the latest chapter.

TLDR version I think that the two Kurozumi elders were Cipher Pol agents

To start this theory we will look at the names

Just in case you don't remember Kumadori was the kabuki monk from Cipher Pol

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a11oinkw0ip41.jpg?width=553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97f308fae10d80483ed6d8e0bfe57bf63a7ff371

Kumadori is actually his surname. His given name is unknown

Kurozumi means **Black** Charcoal(ÈªíÁÇ≠) and Kumadori(„ÇØ„Éû„Éâ„É™) means **Black** Bird.

Not the most crucial piece of evidence but it's something.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m35xfa66yhp41.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cac68c88bddeac0db5534f9f48d8efc43a561058

Ok with that out the way lets figure out how a CP Agent could be linked to Wano

(Warning will require alot of speculation using past events in OP to assume this theory has a similar situation going on.)

Kumadori is someone who looks like he is a first generation immigrant from wano. From the way the acts to his physical features. He pretty much lives as a Kabuki actor and talks in a poetic manner often. While also believes himself to be a Japanese monk/priest. He has pink hair, which many from wano(and Marimo Zoro) seem to have out of the ordinary hair. Kumadori is stated to be from the South Blue. However the despite that ""Kumadori"" can still be from Wano. His descendants/clan could originate from Wano. Another thought I had is the Kumadori Clan could be fabricated by the WG. The purpose of this is to train people to be the perfect Wano Spies. Hence why Kumadori acts the way he does.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xxe4lp1jyhp41.png?width=1142&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63319ba8e7d4158cd2a4b9dcad39d2fe778f84f2

Now lets connect The Kumadori to The Kurozumis and Wano to Cipher Pol.

Orochi: I don't really have anything for him. Besides the fact that Kumadori's hair can make him look like a multi headed snake that's about it. Don't worry I saved the worst for first.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/269w5lkb1ip41.png?width=274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d565bb2221a87fd68606e9929e6c9898312a0b71

Next we have Granny AKA  [Kurozumi Higurashi](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Kurozumi_Higurashi): Is shown to be a priest of some sort. So she shares similarity with one out of three defining features with Kumadori. Kumadori considers himself to be a sennin and uses a shakuj≈ç(Buddhist monk staff). Also think about how perfect her powers are for Cipher Pol. There are two prevalent jobs of CP agents and one of them is spying. It'd be hard to find a better power than the ability to copy appearances.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l8npr9ke1ip41.png?width=857&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc57cd08053858a5544d5e4adf11bda183398eee

[Kurozumi Semimaru](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Kurozumi_Semimaru): There's really not much to say about him but that he is related to music and poetry like Kumadori. Kumadori often talks as if he is singing in a theatre and randomly says a poem from time to time. His power is also perfect for CP members. The other most important job is for them to be bodyguards. Creating a barrier is just the power a human shield needs.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ta4sr4u1ip41.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01bd7f4c20e81afa8643580f0a9d88d698ec8278

Lastly and the one most like Kumadori is Kanjuro. The man who also lives his whole life as an actor. The name Kumadori is actually in reference to Kabuki face pain and Kanjuro is both an actor and a painter. Also Kanjuro lived as a spy and tricked a group of people into thinking he was their dear comrade. The very thing a Cipher Pol agent would do. What Kanjuro did to Oden, CP did to the Iceburg). The talent may just run in the family.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f5ju0fl22ip41.jpg?width=330&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4caf6cb7015850c3490a32a636809b66c27d1696

Now the big question, Is this just a trivial connection or does it play a bigger role in the Story? Here's what I think, the two elder kurozumis were working for the world government and were possibly even Cipher Pol agents. They are **most likely** just working for Kaido, but there is a possibility that they answer to someone else with their own objective. What makes me think that they may not have started out working for Kaido is the fact that Orochi implied that he had to have enough money to team up with Kaido.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/58fl6wqm2ip41.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3214dbb6f49326bb4436792dd1af04c6c77e27e4

Higurashi and Semimaru have devil fruits of their own and even got their hands on the rarest devil fruit type(Mythical) that exists. Not just anybody can do that. Kaido is probably resourceful but he wasn't even a Yonko back then.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/asd811ts2ip41.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f10f8fc57e312de0bb401411e7c9f9f8bcdb051a

 If someone has easy access to devil fruits then there are two types of organizations you'll most likely find them. The underground market(UG) and the World Government(WG). In fact the Clone Clone fruit ended up passing onto Mr.2 of Baroque Works(UG).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvkz34rz2ip41.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97de0be6d9d5bd95ab6e62782301691c4954fbf4

What connects WG and UG is the Cipher Pol. When the WG is known to get their hands dirty and deal with the UG, they use CP to buy weapons, Devil Fruits, and even child slaves. It'd be interesting to see if WG/CP was involved in Kaido's origin story considering the role Mother Carmel played in Big Mom's. Also another case of a rare and strong devil fruit(soul soul) being in the hands of the UG/WG and being passed onto a Pirate. Also it's very likely that many of the children Carmel sold went onto to be cipher pol agents.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5bv48p7b3ip41.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75d0413c627211522cbd0a67f943d406ac826d6f

So here's what I finally propose. The two kurozumi's were Cipher Pol agents sent by the WG to have spies in Wano. Take power from within by assuming the role of a member of the Kurozumi clan and making a member of the clan(Orochi) the shogun. Orochi would be the figure head while the CP/WG rules from the shadows. The WG actually wants to rule Wano in secret because they no longer want to have to work with the UG. Due to Wano is closed off they can openly mass manufacture war waging weapons in an isolated country. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dc4cfqmx3ip41.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9638b2f0f88bea09ffbdb9b1439bdd5d36909194

They don't care if Wano becomes an awful place to live for the vast majority. Wano citizens would only blame Orochi and word would never get out to the rest of the world. Now the two elders that are working undercover aren't actually from the Kurozumi clan, but rather the Kumadori. Within Wano is their own version of Mother Carmel Known as Yamanbako. The Kumadori clan has been secretly working for the WG(for who knows how long). Yamanbako has been raising and selling clan members and orphans to the WG. She is also probably an agent of CP.(Really it doesn't **have to be** Yamanbako, I just picked her since she is actually a named character.)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fhqa9df44ip41.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20527e4a25fa598439334442480ba440500c0d10

Now where does Kaido play into all this? I see two scenarios.

1. Kaido approached Orochi and snakeman took the pirate up on his offer. The elders had no choice but to go along.
2. The elders were actually the ones who introduced Kaido to Orochi and planned their alliance from the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fyp7cjtj4ip41.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1928d8b18e0e4dda49eba7d5c9756bd4247b316

I prefer 2 because I think it would be more interesting if the WG has something to do with Kaido origin. Anyway, what ends up happening is that one way or another Orochi finds out that Semimaru(specifically him cause the old hag is dead) works with the WG. Kaido decides he doesn't want to work with the WG. Orochi then has to make a choice. Side with the WG or Kaido. Seeing is believing and he'd never seen what the WG is really capable of. It only makes sense he'd pick Kaido. Besides the Dragon God is already there and to make him leave would require a war..

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qdaexolp4ip41.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56a8ea414bd4da858e620cddcca40c00dd22409b

To conclude, what does this do for the story going forward?  Although chronologically in the past we do have Kaido's backstory to look forward to. Perhaps he was sold to the WG by Yamanbako as her prized child soldier similar to what almost happened to LinLin. It'd be interesting to find out that Kaido gets his tendency to attempt suicide from the same person as Kumadori.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ia2gy2725ip41.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a3576b62185fb4193538d966cdc3a89b3c2660c

&amp;#x200B;

And maybe will even play a role in the upcoming war. The Paramount War started out as White Beard Alliance vs the Marines. Then impel down escapees, Black Beard, and Red Hair pirates joined. Who will surprise us this time? Perhaps the WG [Sword](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/SWORD) &amp; [Shield](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/CP-0) will enter the fray.

frc4o8,CountZero07,About the Celestial Dragons' Protective Suit,"This is a lightweight theory that's been in my head for a few days. Definitely influenced by current events.

So why do the Celestial Dragons really live inside those protective suits? What if the Celestial Dragons released some sort of toxin  into the world (during the void century) that would suppress the potential/capabilities of normal people. Perhaps this is part of how they were able to assume control over the world. Those with the Will of D are the only people who are immune to this form of control. The world government who is aware of this tries their best to control the population of Ds so that this characteristic is not passed on to more people.

You could argue that there are enough other characters who are pretty strong (like Rayleigh and Shanks) but maybe they're just resistant to a certain degree or have built resistance by being in close proximity of someone with the Will of D.

Just an idea but the only real world equivalent of a four part location system is GPS systems which have center points (cell towers) and send out time stamps at a known speed (c) to measure distance and form radius's. And where ever multiple radius's overlap with all the cell towers would be your location. With three being able to tell you latitude and longitude and four being able to tell you elevation and position on the 3D sphere that is earth.

&amp;#x200B;

So the information on the poneglyphs that give a location might just hint at their starting point (center) and some radial distance away.

frayob,lolaspierrot,Who is the best written character in your opinion?,"Manga spoilers are acceptable, but please spoiler tag them.

In my opinion, OP doesn't perform exceptionally well in the writing of its characters, rather than giving each and every one a solid foreground, which at their base character, simply just makes them enjoyable. This, for me, makes few characters in One Piece actually *compelling* and relatable.

But when these compelling characters *do* show up, they do make One Piece shine reaalllyyy well, especially when it's in addition to the things it's already excelling in. So, here's a few characters I think are compelling:

* Corazon/Rosinante. Although he was explicitly just a flashback character, he was compelling to hell and back and made Law's backstory as good as it could've gotten, taking into consideration Law got dealt a pretty tragic hand in his childhood, and here comes this man, Corazon, ready to give all of it up for this sad kid he barely even knows.
* Bellamy. A character who in terms of character writing, and not purely just enjoyment, I could consider my favourite because he is *so* fucking well done if you actually take into consideration his character in Dressrosa.
* Blackbeard. *Holy fuck I love this man.* In a series that is LARGELY about romanticising dreams in every form possible, implementing this complex character who goes above and beyond for dreams was a fantastic idea. This guy's dream *makes* his identity, and while you could say that's pretty dull at a surface level, this really comes to shine when you see the disparity in his personality between his ""People's dreams never die!"" speech, and how he is later, at the Summit War. His speech in Jaya was genuinely compelling and made him seem like a *great* inspiring guy, which later gets turned upside down in the later arcs, but the beauty in that is that it didn't make his speech in Jaya *any* less genuine, and I find that extremely interesting.

Characters who I think have the *potential* to be interesting and compelling:

* Akainu. ""Good"" guy hate ""bad"" people, completely indiscriminate against pirates regardless of character. Very much. It's a generic formula at its base, but given how much of an extremist Akainu is, there should be *good* reason behind it.
* Kaido. I'm honestly not convinced he's going to be made compelling in a way that can strike me with how Oda has been writing him so far, but there'd be a LOT to dig into with how his character has been portrayed so far.

So, what do y'all think? What characters do you find compelling, and what characters do you think have the *potential* to become compelling and hard-hitting over the course of the series?",57,1585507832,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/frayob/who_is_the_best_written_character_in_your_opinion/,OnePiece,5

I mean, would Oda really waste some precious manga pages tackling about Marco and Neko's encounter if it wont serve anything in the storyline? Oda would have just put Marco's story in the title page sidequest if it wasnt that important.

The reason Oda wrote it that way(Marco couldnt come) is to have a tension in the story. It wouldnt be as exciting if all things happens according to plan.

fr8xjm,RodNun,Theory: The nine shadows are not people‚Äôs shadows,"Theory: **The nine shadows are not people‚Äôs shadows**

**Lady Toki and the prophecy ‚Äì Chapter 973**

Everyone knows about Lady Toky‚Äôs prophecy. She said: ‚ÄúNine shadows will bring a blinding sunrise‚Äù. She never said ""nine people"" or ""nine scabbards""; she said ""nine shadows"". It's not necessary nine people's shadows, it could be any shadow. It could even be something dark, that looks like a shadow‚Ä¶.

Sleep on this idea, I‚Äôll come back t this after some explanation of what I mean by that.

&amp;#x200B;

**The 9 scabbards and their duty**

After chapter 975, it‚Äôs clear to me that there won‚Äôt be 9 scabbards, but only 8, when Nekomamushi is back. Kikunojo‚Äôs brother (Izo) will not come back. It was already said that Edward Weevil (the elleged Whitebeard‚Äôs son) is hunting Whitebeard‚Äôs crew, and he already got 16 captains (chapter 802), but we don‚Äôt know anything about commanders. Maybe he already got some of them too, including Izo. Now he is going after Marco The Phoenix, so probably he (Marco) will be with his hands full.

So, supposing there are only 8 scabbards, and their duty is to open Wano, their goal must be to take Orochi‚Äôs heads, not Kaido‚Äôs head. Orochi is the official leader, and in his Snake-Snake form, he has 8 heads (chapter 933). I bet one scabbard will get each head.

And the thing is, Oda haven‚Äôt show yet what are the extensions of Orochi‚Äôs power. He is a coward, like Blackbeard, and even though, Blackbeard is a very powerful enemy. Orochi‚Äôs fruit could give him a lot of resistance, as we already saw in other mythical fruits before, and he had 20 years to train how to use it. He is not stupid, and he prepared himself to fight against the ‚Äú9 shadows‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

**Luffy is training to fight Kaido, but he won‚Äôt**

Luffy will have his hands full, fighting against Big Mom. Even if he wants to fight Kaido, Big Mom went to another emperor‚Äôs territory only to get Luffy. What we still don‚Äôt know is if she still wants to kill him or marry him. She could change her mind, who knows?

**Let‚Äôs talk about Zoro a little bit**

When I think about Zoro‚Äôs trajectory as a character, there are many pieces of information I can add up to build an understanding of his strength, his potential and ultimately, his hole in the Wano Arc. I would like to remember some steps he did before:

**Zoro vs Kaku ‚Äì Chapter 417 ‚Äì Asura: the 9 swords style**

Zoro can turn himself into the devil spirit Asura, who has 3 faces and 6 arms. In this fight he could win over Kaku using 9 swords. An important detail is at that time he had only regular blades, no black blades yet.

**Zoro vs Monet ‚Äì Chapter 687 ‚Äì A wild BEAST**

In this fight he refers to himself as an ‚Äúwild animal‚Äù, or in some translations, a ‚Äúwild beast‚Äù (what I prefer, and I use this one).

**Zoro vs Pica ‚Äì Chapter 778 ‚Äì 3 black swords**

Zoro could surpass Pica‚Äôs haki infusing his own haki into his blades. I know the blades were not black yet, but this showed how Zoro already had powered up a lot, having the capacity to turn any sword into a black blade.

**Zoro gets Enma ‚Äì Chapter 955 ‚Äì One of the two swords that had ever hurt Kaido**

After got Enma, Zoro‚Äôs powered up again, but this time with one of the two only swords in the world that had already hurt Kaido.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, in the end, what all these means?**

Assuming that Orochi could misunderstood Lady Toki's message (the same way Kinemon misread Yasuie's message), he is right on fearing the scabbards, because they are going after Orochi‚Äôs heads, as I said before. But they are not the ones that will fight Kaido. Zoro is the one that will fight Kaido, alone.

Why Zoro alone will defeat Kaido? Now it‚Äôs time to put all info together:

\- Zoro is a **WILD BEAST**. Kaido can be a beast too, so it will be a battle between beasts.

\- **Zoro can triple the power of a sword, using the Devil Spirit Ashura**. This means that he can use 3 Enmas. When Oden fought Kaido, he used 2 fine swords, so in this point of view, Zoro is more powerful than Oden. And he already has other 2 swords, that could be turned into more 6, summing 9 in total. Zoro has much more ammunition than Oden.

\- He can **turn any sword into a black blade** using haki.

&amp;#x200B;

So, going back to Lady Toki‚Äôs prophecy: ‚ÄúNine shadows will bring a blinding sunrise‚Äù. It could be any shadow. It could even be something dark, that looks like a shadow.

It could be... Zoro‚Äôs nine black blades.

I know it sounds crazy, but I believe it‚Äôs a classic Oda move. lol",16,1585500668,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fr8xjm/theory_the_nine_shadows_are_not_peoples_shadows/,OnePiece,0

fr6lg9,illogicalfuturity,Blackbeard Pirates.........,"I've felt the Blackbeard Pirates are the weakest of the Yonkos, they don't feel intimidating and Blackbeard doesn't possess that air or gravitas an Emperor should have.

Shanks using his Haki to make the weaker members of the Whitebeard Pirates pass out was a cool introduction, Whitebeard being a sickly man but still commanding respect and proving his badassery by flipping the ocean and dying without backing down, Big Mom being a crazed glutton belies the fact she is a monster, and Kaidou just appearing was amazing.

Blackbeard is an opportunist and doesn't pick fights he knows he won't win, I thought he was a dominant bad guy for what he did to Ave but that vanished when he wnet against Whitebeard and was almost pissing himself when pops went on the warpath for him. 

Blackbeard gathering devil fruit powers seems to be his undoing because one of the tenets of the New World is that Logias die young because Haki is prevalent in there.

Even his subordinates don't give me any feelings that they are powerhouses. The other Yonkous' subordinates did though, Jack and Katakuri are the best example then you have the Supernovae who are under then. Capine raising hell for shits and giggles but also being a family was good to see.

I feel that the newest dethroners of the Yonkos would be Luffy who is already dubbed the Fifth Emperor, Kidd, and Law.",15,1585491726,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fr6lg9/blackbeard_pirates/,OnePiece,1
fr6kcu,Villa827,Manga releases during quarantine,"Anyone have an idea if Shonen Jump has the ability to release chapters remotely? (Especially during this pandemic?)

When I picture a Mangaka working with his staff I get an image of people gathered together in a studio working diligently off of Oda's ideas/blueprints to create, ultimately, the final print.

Does anyone know if the current process allows for Oda to simply draw pages from home, scan them, and send them remotely to his staff and editors? Who ALSO might have remote set ups?

The most important thing by FAR is Oda and his staffs health, and by god- that man deserves a break!! (Even if he's forced to take one.) 

But my knowledge is limited, and I'm curious what the modern procedure for creating and releasing a chapter entails- and if it allows for this industry to keep going during the pandemic?

fr5pmf,strudel-doodles,"Yeah, Another Luffy VS Goku Post (Serious)","(Disclaimer: I honestly don't know why people can't comprehend the following points I make. It's not very hard to understand. I don't want any insulting me or anyone else in the comments. I want this to be a nice civil discussion. The following text was from a YouTube comment I posted on a ""Luffy vs Goku"" CBR video in regard to everyone automatically dismissing Luffy because of Goku's sheer strength. This was the following comment):

&amp;#x200B;

"" Luffy is rubber, he can withstand being poisoned with toxic gas, deadly explosions, being shot with canon balls, and getting crushed by giants. On top of this, Luffy has gotten up from being stabbed in the abdomen, getting his insides torn up, and having a lava fist penetrate his chest and taking a freaking trident to his liver and ribs then continuing a fight against his strongest foe yet, as of literally the last arc we just finished.  

Without Haki, Goku's blunt force attacks aren't going to do anything to him.  He could try an energy blast but Luffy is stronger and faster than those could ever hit. (As he can avoid a Pacifista's laser beam effortlessly, which are replicated from the ability of the guy who LITERALLY ATTACKS AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT)   Yes, with enough force, rubber can snap apart. Incomes Armament Haki.  

This ability allows Luffy to harden desired parts of his body to be able to handle any puncture based attacks such as swords, spears, and kicks that could break skin. Normally, it's already very tanky, but using it with Gear Fourth.. oof, nothing Goku would do is getting past that.  And now in the series, Luffy can use Haki to see slightly into the future, making Goku's speed null and void of argument.  

Also if people don't think Bounceman or Snakeman can even **hurt** Goku, then you're just being biased.  Just because a character can rival gods and all that nonsense doesn't make them top tier of any other character.  I know physically weak dudes who could wreck Goku's shit.  Such as Yuu from Charlotte (being able to take over and control the consciousness of anyone's body - sends Goku into orbit, R.I.P), or Rohan from Jojo.  (Goku's not too basically bright, have him look at Heaven's Door, write a command to prevent Goku from attacking Rohan, bam, wins.)

 It's not all about brawn and status. Sometimes good planning and amazing defense can come a long way. Also just the fact that just as nobody lacking Haki could touch a Logia because of their elemental abilities, the same applies for Luffy and Goku.

 Hate on me all you want, but there is no arguing, Luffy would either beat Goku over time, or the battle would end in a draw.  I'm not saying Goku isn't strong. He's the second most physically powerful guy in media imo, but Luffy would be such a bad matchup for him, haha.""

&amp;#x200B;

Listen, I don't care if Luffy in actuality cannot beat Goku. Maybe my theory isn't all correct. But I know a fair amount is at least reasonable. I don't mind Goku, I grew up with DragonBall Z! But I'm sick and tired of people shitting on Luffy and acting like he's a piece of cardboard in comparison to Goku, as if he posed little to no threat.",37,1585487640,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fr5pmf/yeah_another_luffy_vs_goku_post_serious/,OnePiece,1

fr4wqs,ishraklancer,What is Kozuki Toki sent JoyBoy 800 years into the future (and also left clues in laugh tale)!?,"Ok so hear me out, and also apologies if this had been discussed earlier because I couldn‚Äôt find any similar posts. 
So here goes. Toki is 800 years from the past right? 830 to be exact. 28 years prior to the Void Century. JoyBoy was also from around that time. And if so many of the ongoing theories are true that JoyBoy will return to fulfill his promise in Fishman Island and also fulfill the prophecy of the great war, that means that he will have to jump in time to achieve that (unless he has an immortality type fruit, ah that might be interesting). And isn‚Äôt Toki whose past we know so little about except for the fact that she jumped 800 years is such a convenient plot device ? I think that Toki knew JoyBoy and actually herself sent him to the current time, which is totally why she was obsessed with sending the Red Scabbards and momonosuke EXACTLY 20 years into the future... because she KNOWS that joyboy is there in the world at that time and will come to their aid.

Now this part is totally speculative but, They (toki or joyboy) also leave some sort of message or clue in Laugh Tale regarding when in time they will be, since they know at which point in time they will be. And that is how Roger Pirates knew they were EXACTLY 20 years too early.

 If Kuma still had his own free will it would make sense but at this point you're wasting a valuable weapon (cuz that's what he is at this point). Instead of given the CD a super strong Cyborg with the most OP fruit ever, why not give them a regular Pacifista instead? It's such a waste of a strong fruit.

I think they might get Oven's devil fruit. Many people think the BB pirates are going to WCI and if they are, there is no way they can defend it. Oven is probably the 3rd strongest there and I think he could be killed and get his fruit stolen. It is unlikely that we see Katakuri's or Cracker's so Oven's makes sense.

fqyu5o,GREENKING45,About the advanced armament haki ( as people like to call it ),"Now I have seen that 90% of the people in this sub call the new method of using haki that Luffy learned as advanced armament. People are thinking now that only the strongest can have that haki. Its something really special. And that haki would boost power of a person.

Now "" I will have to break that illusion of yours!'

Firstly there is nothing advanced about it AS all of the kuja pirates knew how to use it! Remember the arrows for the people who don't remember ( really how can you forget?). Even then Luffy beat all of them without having any haki at all! Kuja pirates had basic observation haki as well. And the so called advanced armament haki as well. Yet Luffy won. 

Now almost every sword user who uses haki is using that so called advanced armament haki as well. Because normal haki can't be enveloped. So include law,katakuri,smoothy and tons of big mom pirates having it. ( all of them are so advanced! Yet Luffy beat 'em) 

Get this the so called advanced armament haki does NOT boost your power. Its just a technique to use your power in a more useful way. In fact the basic haki is the same  it does not boost your power. Your real physical power is what's really important. 

Here is a side point. Maybe training with haki increases your basic physical power. The more physical power you have that's the amount of DMG you can do. I am not saying haki doesn't increase power. It does. But its adds into your own power. If you don't have much power having even the advanced armament ( so called) is useless!

Now to explain what this advanced armament ( so called) haki does. It can be used in 2 ways. 1 is to envelope weapons. ( it does more DMG and can catch logia of course it's very useful) 2 for non weapon users it can become an invading force which can shatter enemies from the inside.

Now here is to note that generally swordsman like zoro wouldn't use haki in other parts of body and would focus on swords so their cutting power would be max. ( we don't know if haki from swords invade enemies or not. Let's assume it doesn't) so he uses 100% of his haki in sword allowing maximum cutting power and having no need to have his haki invade enemies ( or maybe he can't through sword ). 

Now non sword users have to use haki for defense as well. So they use the excess haki they have to fight. And to invade and shatter enemies from within. So the use of haki differs between fist fighter and swordsman.

So we can just call it ""enveloping haki"" for swordsman and ""invading haki"" for fist fighters.

To sum it all up haki is way to boost your base power. So having a good physical power is important. This advanced armament ( so called ) is just another way to use haki. Which many have already been using. 

On a side note : we can call luffy's observation advanced because it increases his capabilities ( or rather the stats of his haki.) In one scanlation they tried to explain this observation with concept that basic observation can predict moves in the next 1 second. And with advanced you can do it for the next 5 seconds. But I rather like the anime explanation. About ""being able to predict the next move"" and ""being able to see slightly ahead in the future"".

If any of you have the power to logically defeat me then Try it in the comments. I welcome you. However I have yet to see any real high level otaku in this sub. All here are only good for fantasizing what one piece is. ( don't mean to offend those theories). Just saying that no real logical battle can be done here BECAUSE you guys are too emotionally attached to just one character. I'd rather the people from my most favourite series's sub can come here and beat me. It would be fun to be defeated as well!",35,1585451935,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fqyu5o/about_the_advanced_armament_haki_as_people_like/,OnePiece,1

Which is why when Kaido and Luffy fought each other, Kaido instantly became sober again as the curse activated. It also explains all the stories about Kaido being seemingly immortal but as we know still being damaged by Oden because the ""curses"" wasn't placed upon him yet.

fqxdkm,Sircrocodile666,Who is the most likely to die in the final battle in Wano ?,"Which character is the most likely to die in the final battle in Wano ?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the top 3 with death flags over them imo.

Law. I think Law is a possibility because he doesnt seem to have much of a purpose in the story after Doffy being defeated. He is kind of similar to Ace in a way. Loved, good looking character who might die.

Kinemon. He is the another beloved (non strawhat) character whose death would definitely shock and impact the readers.

Jinbei. Well he has a death wish for 500 chapters now...

Other characters who might die..

Killer. He is already fucked up and quarantined, Oda might as well pull the trigger to push Kidd over the edge.

Other Scabbards. Inu and Neko are a possibility, but it still wouldnt be the same Kinemon dying imo.

Kaido. Luffy crashes his opponent's dreams. Kaido dreams of dying, so I expect him in a jail cell in impel down in the end of the arc.

Big Mom. It could happen.

Sanji using Sky Walk to approach King and then them having a fire fight as Sanji uses Diable Jambe and King uses his fire abilities and Zoro would obviously have a sword battle with King. I feel that if they fight King together it would solve any power creep if they both fought a yonko commander on their own yet also make it more realistic for them to be yonko commander level when Wano concludes as they should also get some hits in on Kaido or Big Mom (if Zoro was to solo King I don't see how he would be able to do anything else in the war as well as Sanji vs Queen)",9,1585435755,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fquh8a/zoro_sanji_vs_king/,OnePiece,0

When my life wasn't so good, the new chapter was the only thing that I was looking for and kept me going through the week.
Time went on and my life became significantly better and I sometimes I even forgot to check it. Still every time the new chapter was released I spent half an hour every week(or two) enjoying it, reading through reddit discussion and Artur's analysis. It became kind of ritual for me.

And in the past weeks when the situation in the world is becoming more and more overwhelming I have never been so much grateful that the One Piece is still here. I fear every day about my future and I have a really hard time to find peace. 
I look forward to the new chapters like I have been looked 8 years ago and its again became the only thing that brightens my day and keeps me going. 
I'm not probably ever have a chance to personally thank Oda for his great work but I had to get it off my chest.

fqpt19,ErisGrey,[Theory] Luffy has the use of two devil fruits.,"Devil Fruit One - Gomu Gomu no mi

Devil Fruit Two - The voice of All Things

Inherited Will: 

The series is very big on inherited will, and we just assume it is Luffy's ""inherited will"" that gives him the power Roger had. I don't believe this is the case. This isn't passing on a desire, it is passing on power. Granted he can't hear all things all the time, but when he can there is a very strong connection. 

The Strawhat

The Strawhat is the most obvious connection. Much like Roger inherited the voice of all things, being able to hear the poneglyphs even though he couldn't read the language. Luffy is slowly inheriting it himself as well. The more unique places and people Luffy comes across, the more silent voices he can hear. The clearer people's heart comes to him. 

Creation

The Strawhat's are created in Wano. They were created in the same place the Poneglyph's were created. This is no mere coincidence and I believe the two are intricately connected. But how so has yet to be seen. 

The Ohara Scientists

We learned in the Ohara arc that the ancients spoke a language that no one alive knows anymore (except Robin). We learn about how great and advanced these people were, I can't help but feel they know languages change over time. 

Note* The biggest hype in media the year before One Piece was released was a book called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. An important part is the book had a very special hat in it. It could read what was truly in the heart of the people around them. It whispered in such a way, that the wearer would believe the voice was coming from inside their own head. 

Theory

The creators of the Poneglyph's created them knowing full well their society was coming to an end. They knew the collapse of their cities were inevitable, the destruction of their teachings couldn't be stopped. In an attempt to preserve their history they created the indestructible Poneglyph's (I believe by instilling the haki of their entire society into one giant block poneglyph similar to the black blades). But preserving something, doesn't necessarily mean it will remain useful. In order to make sure it could still be used, they needed a Rosetta Stone. Something that would be able to translate the tablet to who ever inherits the will in the future. 

Knowing that, I believe that they imbued a Strawhat with a mythical devil fruit (Omni Omni no Mi). Made sure that the Hat was always passed down from one generation to the next, so that it can reach the person it needs to in the future. I believe that is why we always see it going from a Captain to a Child. I also believe that Momonosuke wore the hat before Luffy and that is why he was able to hear Zou. I believe Odin gave Roger the hat to get it out of Wano when Wano was under attack in hopes to preserve it. 

Luffy

Luffy doesn't treat the hat like a possession. Luffy treats the hat as if it is a living breathing member of the crew (If not THE reason he is out at sea). He mourns for it's injuries greater than the injuries of his crew, as if he knows the hat is more important then they are. There's a good chance all his stupid ideas that worked out were the whisperings of an ancient hat ready to go home. 

The power to hear the words of the silent, to hear the truth hidden in lies, and to know the feelings of those around you. These are very specific powers. He didn't receive them all at once, instead he awakens them at different points in the story. His connections to all the different people in the land strengthens his connection to the voice of all things power of the hat. Once he circles the world, he'll be able to awake the full power of the hat, and read the poneglyphs. I feel why that is why Rayleigh told him the journey was just as important. 

I also believe that the hat was sorting all the early members for Luffy, ie ignore what this guy is saying he wants to join you. Yeah that chick really didn't want to kill you, you should help her. 

The most important person that works for a king, is the advisor. They are there to relay the wishes and desires of the people to the king. The Strawhat gives that power, and that's why the rulers who previously wore it, such as JoyBoy, were considered the happiest places to live. I also believe the peace that was in Wano prior was thanks to someone wearing the Strawhat.",7,1585420803,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fqpt19/theory_luffy_has_the_use_of_two_devil_fruits/,OnePiece,0

This post will be brief since there is not enough information to write a fully fledged theory as I have in the past. This is essentially just a well-informed hunch.

28 years ago Roger came down with an incurable disease which kickstarted his final voyage through the Grand Line and discovery of Laugh Tale. I believe that this was a case of [Love Sickness](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Love_Sickness) caused by Portgas D. Rouge. As we know, the disease is common with the Kuja Empresses who fall for men, and when the emotion is suppressed it eventually causes death. The only way to cure the disease is by following the one you love and accepting your emotions. Roger, like Luffy, is a man who desires freedom above all else. He would never lay down his dreams for a woman, and hence to him, this disease was incurable.

26 years ago Crocus gave Roger only a year to live, and this led to the crew rushing to finish the journey. Within months, the crew had found Laugh Tale and Roger was the King of the Pirates. The crew disbanded on Roger's orders and went their separate ways, but Roger wasn't to die for another 2 years. Was Crocus wrong? Or was Roger somehow able to delay the inevitable?

Following the disbandment, Roger reunited with Rouge and Portgas D. Ace was conceived. By following his emotions, Roger was temporarily cured of Love Sickness, however it was all just part of his new plan. This period with Rouge gave Roger the time he needed to do two things:

1. To have a son/daughter that would become Pirate King and fulfill the prophecy of Joy Boy described at Laugh Tale
2. To make preparations and enable the future Pirate King by instigating the Great Pirate Era

Once Roger had explained things to [Whitebeard](https://imgur.com/a/Cz2WGPb), [Rayleigh](https://imgur.com/a/nXlbREX), and the other forebearers of the Era that was about to explode, his time had come. He surrendered to Garp, a man he trusted as much as his own crewmates and who he knew could locate Rouge, and asked that he take care of his unborn child for him.

And thus 24 years ago, with his final words, Roger ushered in the Great Pirate Era, awaiting the day that another great man would emerge and fulfill the prophecy of One Piece.",13,1585419072,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fqp9jb/rogers_incurable_disease_was_actually/,OnePiece,0

I get that the SHs are main characters and not allowed to die but I am suppose to feel and question if  they are really going to and i feel none of that. It is either because of the excessive amount of plot armor or just the attitude of the enemies and them being unrealistic in trying to defeat/kill the Straw Hats. Like Kaido has this drunk, don't care attitude, and wants to recruit strong people and Big Mom always has hunger pangs or lost memories. And there were like countless times where i felt the enemies could have and should have killed the Straw Hats. Why make them so strong and unbeatable in the first place and then make so much plot armor just so the Straw Hats have a chance?

fqk3ng,Extinction17,The One Piece will be uncovered before the end of Wano. Blackbeard Takes over!,"I honestly think that when ""Whitebeard"" Newgate spoke of a ""War to engulf the world"" and Oden spoke of a ""war that will split the seas"" that they were talking about the same Battle. But there's one Detail Whitebeard mentioned that Oden didn't, The One Piece will be uncovered **before the War starts.** 

Now in my opinion, there's a certain fleet/squad en route to the One Piece which is most likely why &gt;!Blackbeard showed interest in where they were going and wanted to intercept them for whatever they're prize was.!&lt; And Akainu could find it anyway because he's so strong! I think there was a special crew or fleet sent out and are returning to Navy HQ with the treasure in tow... and The **Blackbeard Pirates** in pursuit!! 


 The Marines will have either have little time to prepare or will hopefully already be prepared. Knowing it's going to be worse than last time, because not only must they once again deal another one of the Yonko with the power of the Gura Gura no mi, but now the Yami Yami no mi as well, all wielded by *One man**! Blackbeard himself will reveal he's gotten stronger (and  probably awakened one of his devil fruits,) and wreaks *worse havoc on  New Marineford than even Whitebeard did at Old Marineford.* killing more Marines and their *families* across the Island.


 It's at this point, Fleet Admiral Sakazuki will get involved (God Ussop, have mercy on Teach at this point.) Wiping out multiple fleets with his powers before engaging Teach himself, Kuzan will admit his role in S.W.O.R.D. as he betrays Blackbeard and helps protect the Navy and their HQ, turning the tide back. Shiryu, sensing Blackbeard is gonna fail, turns on him, but is easily defeated and killed by Blackbeard. 

Blackbeard will be seen wearing a Straw hat (in mockery of Luffy) as he uses the Yami Yami no mi to cancel Kuzan and Sakazuki's powers. And levels New Marineford with the Gura Gura no mi and as Kuzan and Sakazuki are weakened, Kills one, and wounds/cripples the other to send a clear message to the Marines. 

Teach might both his powers to destroy/swallow the Red Line. Killing the World Nobles and declaring himself in their place as ruler of the world ( this may be an Unpopular opinion, but this makes sense for Teach do this if he really has Xebec's will, considering this what Xebec was going to do anyway: **Kill the Celestial Dragons and take their place**.) Also Fishman Island in the process, (which Madame Shyarly's premonition is fulfilled as Blackbeard was wearing a Straw hat to mock Luffy.) 

Teach takes the  One Piece from the Marines and as Sengoku feared from Whitebeard, uses the full power of the Gura Gura no mi to cause ruin around the world, and **literally split the seas** as Oden foresaw. Then creates a Black hole with the Yami Yami no mi to suck up and swallow the Red line debris, returning the sea level to normal (as he still wants a world worth taking over, not because he's actually saving anyone.) 

 With his own dream fulfilled, and Rock's will carried out, Blackbeard leaves with the One Piece. Established as the definitive Antagonist",10,1585401812,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fqk3ng/the_one_piece_will_be_uncovered_before_the_end_of/,OnePiece,1

So last night I watched One Piece Stampede and I was wondering how other fans felt about the movie. It seems that the general consensus is that it was quite good, but for me personally when I watched it, I was honestly let down. I love One Piece, currently reading the manga and about to get to Wano, but the movie just didn't do it for me the same way other people seem to be reacting. Idk if I missed something crucial or just didn't approach it right, but in the end it did an Endgame for me where it was a whole lot of fanservice and not a whole lot of movie, and I could write out my argumentation for my thoughts but if you guys ever got to meet me you would understand why reviewing it would become a colossal task for me.

Anyways, I always have and will always love One Piece so don't think I'm hating on it in any way. I'm just interested in what the rest of the community feel about it.",26,1585390779,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fqhi5q/what_do_you_guys_think_of_one_piece_stampede_poll/,OnePiece,1

my argument was-just because they look comedic dosen't mean they are weak;they do not necessarily need to be strong.pure strength isnt the only way to win ,they have been planning this for years;they do not need to be strong ;they can ally with other pirate groups and bring down the wg.they are not pirates and they dont need to fight person to person.they can do so with tactics and they have been shown to do things in secret;

i dont believe the revolutionary army is weak because of its members,they can cause quite a stir ; there are other ways then strength to win a war

Guess what Kidd, you do meet up in the new world. With a panel similar to this one, where you 3 team up again. 

Man I love the parallels in this show.

Side note: a marine tells Garp that Raleigh is ""captured"". He says he cant go face him cuz they will get wrecked, and besides, ""you dont wanna face off against TWO legends right now, do you?"", implying theres another legend that isnt normally there.

Luffy was 7 years old then, and recently in the manga, we got more info on the Yonko and their current bounties. According to Sengoku, Shanks is the youngest Yonko (ig Teach is a lil older) but has been one for 6 years. Luffy is 19 now, so subtract 6, and that means Shanks was labeled as a Yonko when Luffy was 13. This also means from the time of the lost arm incident, it took Shanks 6 years to BECOME a Yonko. 

Essentially, from when Luffy was 7, add 6 years and that‚Äôs when Shanks became a Yonko, then add another 6 years, which is not only the present (because this means Luffy is 19, which he is), but how long Shanks has been a Yonko for. 

One thing IDK about is Shanks losing his arm, I mean it was really early in the story itself, so ig Oda maybe didn‚Äôt think precisely about the logic of Shanks power and especially Haki in that matter, but then again it did take 6 years since that incident for Shanks to become a Yonko, and he might do things impulsively sometimes, so maybe he forgot to use conqueror‚Äôs Haki BEFORE saving Luffy lol. It‚Äôs just something we have to accept 

Nonetheless, man is EPIC, and I‚Äôd like to talk about him with the Gorosei, but that can be talked about in the comments if you guys want. I‚Äôm willing to discuss that too.",9,1585353733,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fq93yo/shanks_his_yonko_timeline_the_lost_arm_incident/,OnePiece,1

fq8u4r,Drogaritory,Is it even possible for Luffy to come close to Kaido at the end of this arc yet alone defeat him?,"I don‚Äôt know what Oda‚Äôs endgame for this arc is but I know the final battle will be Luffy vs kaido with Luffy‚Äôs friends helping him(as it always is). The issue I have is that, Oda has hyped up Kaido and made him so stupidly strong that it would make zero sense for Luffy to even come near him at the end of this arc, even after his workouts and Haki training in the prison. This is kind of an issue I have with One Piece, it just seems like Oda just keeps setting things up in a way where he can keep on dragging the story(or whatever this is at this point) for as long as he wants. If he didn‚Äôt make kaido some ridiculously overpowered animal then it would make sense for Luffy to at least be able to just barely beat him at the end of the arc but that isn‚Äôt the case, if Luffy wins any battle he has with kaido for the remainder of this arc it will feel like a massive asspull.

I figure they won‚Äôt be able to beat Kaido at the end of the arc and he‚Äôll show up again later in the series as an antagonist once more, this is what i meant by Oda dragging the story.",24,1585352803,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fq8u4r/is_it_even_possible_for_luffy_to_come_close_to/,OnePiece,1

My guess is they will play as an observer and won't pick a fight unless it's a direct clash with them, but you never know what Oda will come up with.

fq4ieb,miyukez,Kidd and Vegapunk,"This is a bit of a stretch, but I've been wondering if a connection between Kidd and Vegapunk will be revealed.

My evidence admittedly isn't much:

Kidd has a cyberpunk vibe, which is in line with One Piece's style of futuristic tech. 

Oda's [picture](https://images.app.goo.gl/19P81h4i6EYx2pf3A) of him as a child implies he is an inventor or mechanic. 

Kidd uses the word ""punk"" in the name of his ship, and many of his attacks. 

Here's why I think this theory makes sense:

Now, as we know, the Supernova were all invented on the spot, and Oda created their designs and characters within a day. Kidd was also conceived on this day, but Oda thought initially that he would be the most important of the Supernova going forwards. 

Law was always designed to be connected to Doffy in some way (probably). We know this because his flag was a play on Doffy's, which is a pretty unique design within the One Piece verse. He was also introduced at a venue which belonged to him.

So, it makes sense that the two Supernovas Oda placed the most attention on in their initial introduction were tied into future important characters/arcs, as that is an easy way to insert a completely new character into the story, and assure that they'd have some relevance down the line. Law was always designed to be related in some way to Doffy, and Kidd to Vegapunk.",1,1585339512,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fq4ieb/kidd_and_vegapunk/,OnePiece,1

-Zoro vs King(Lets have Zoro take out the right hand of a Yonkou)

-Sanji vs Queen (Queen and King have some sort of relationship like Zoro and Sanji so I think these match ups are perfect)

-Jinbe vs Smoothie(End his relationship with Big Mom once and for all)

-Killer vs Jack(he‚Äôs part of the worst generation and if Oda wants to have Kidd or Law play any relevant role in the story going forward their crews need to be strong. He had a higher bounty than Zoro pre-timeskip so he better fight a Calamity or I‚Äôm going to be disappointed)

-Jean Bart vs Charlotte Perospero(same reason as above)

Reminder: there are 4 headliners still not defeated

-Robin vs Headliner(needs a good battle to stay relevant. Come on Oda just one good Robin fight)

-Franky vs Headliner (needs a good battle to stay relevant)

-Brook vs Charlotte Daifuku (Big Mom wants to get back at Brook, here‚Äôs a good fight)

-Bepo vs Headliner (same reason as Killer vs Jack)

- Kid Pirates Person vs Headliner (same reason as Killer vs Jack)

-Nami, Chopper, and Usopp vs people who I don‚Äôt know the names of

Nine Red Scabbards vs Orochi and posse(I think the samurai vs samurai and pirates vs pirates is a good matchup for this fight)

fq2ehs,pokeboy626,Wano Anime Eye-catcher Theory?,"Have you noticed that for the entirety of Wano arc's airing in the anime, that they only used two catchers? The only eye catchers shown are Luffy's and Zoro's. Even in the recent episodes where Sanji was the main focus, the eye catchers were still Luffy and Zoro. There are a few possible reasons as to why this is the case:

1. Only Luffy and Zoro's eyecatchers have been made
2. The anime staff forgot to switch them out

or...

3.  **The anime is trying to give us a hint**

&amp;#x200B;

This isnt the first time that the anime has spoiled the manga. Remember how it alluded to Kanjuro and Kyoshiro? What if they are trying to tell us something again. Perhaps the reason why they keep on using Luffy and Zoro's eye-catchers is because those two will be the MVPs of the Wano arc.

fq12xo,G_STAR_4LIFE,Am I the only one that doesn't buy how much Peron cares about Moriah?,"When Perona found out that Moriah suddenly disappeared from the Marineford Battlefield, gripped with the idea he could have died, she was reduced to tears and was completely devastated. Flashforward two years later she discovers that Moriah is indeed alive and jumps for joy as if she's found her purpose for living again.

Now, I don't mind Moriah being a father figure to Perona, a person who took her in his crew, protected and raised her when she had no where else to go, this is the impression I got from Perona's reaction to Moriah being alive. I think this would be pretty dope the problem lies in the fact it doesn't make sense and seems very forced.

Before the timeskip, back on Thriller Bark when the strawhats were facing Oars, pandemonium was erupting all over the Island/Ship, it got so bad for the Thriller Bark Pirates, Perona decided to up and go.

How can Oda say this character deeply cares for Moriah, when at smallest sign of trouble Perona decides to desert him? She was literally going to steal his treasure, take the Sunny and flea from the scene altogether. She did it with zero remorse as well, then suddenly a few arcs later she starts crying for him because he could be dead, when she was LITERALLY GOING TO LEAVE MORIAH FOR DEAD.

Go back and watch the scene on youtube with Perona getting ready to leave Thriller Bark and Kuma stopping her, you'll see she acts like a pampered brat that's ready to leave her ""papa"" at a moments drop with no regrets.

It's quite weird how Oda did this. I personally don't buy her behaviour, it's too contradictory to how she behaves on thriller Bark.

What are you thoughts? Does it make sense? Do you think Oda could have developed more the relationship between Moriah and Perona? It's a very interesting yet weird relationship in my opinion.",6,1585329522,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fq12xo/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_buy_how_much_peron/,OnePiece,1

fq04r5,Jjy123,Just finished the arlong park arc in the manga and WOW,"So picked back up one piece from chapter 40 something 2 days ago. I finished the arlong park arc yesterday and it was great.

Nami's backstory was heart wrenching. And her struggle to maintain a cold detached persona in front of the fishmen while trying not to get anyone killed was so ingruting. The moment when she broke down and asked for help from luffy was amazing.

The emotion in this arc was fantastic too. You really felt the struggle of the village people under the fishmens rule during this arc. It did a great job of you wanting to see these guys get their justice and have the fishmens ass get kicked.

This arc was also so badass in how every member of the crew got to shine. It was the first time they really came together as a cree and it was so rewarding to see them all march into arlong park to help nami. And every member had their own fight that highlighted their strengths. I was especially impressed by usopp. He may be the most outwardly cowardly member in the strawhats but he throws that cowardice to the side multiple times during this aec to be the hero he envisions in his mind and its really respectable.

Also this arc made me realise why luffy works so well as a protagonist. He may be simple minded but that leads to him being and incredible charismatic and confident persona which is perfect for a leader. The way he just said ""lets go"" and the rest of the strawhats started walling with him was BADASS.

The final fight was also a pretty great climax. The fights aren't very complicated but the emotion behind the fights more than make up for it. Seeing Arlong gets axed was satisfying asf. It was great to see nami and her village finally be freed.

So yeah sorry for the long rant but this arc really impressed me. Im understand why this manga is so beloved by people now. And i know that the manga apparently gets even better after the east blue saga so im hyped for that.",20,1585326764,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fq04r5/just_finished_the_arlong_park_arc_in_the_manga/,OnePiece,1

fpy7fe,Orcas_are_badass,Some love for a lesser talked about talent of Oda's,"Something about One Piece that I don't ever see us talk about is Oda's ability to compromise with the editors at Shonen Jump, and to implement their changes without ruining his story. I think that's actually one of the main qualities of his that makes One Piece consistently good. There are many good series where the quality was ruined midway through and you can see it's cause the author agreed to some change that they just couldn't write well.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, chopper being cute. Oda's original concept for Chopper was a gruff chain smoking Dr. It's pretty obvious his editors pushed for Chopper to be a cute plushy character so they can make more money on merchandise. Oda was able to rework the character in a way that made him a fan favorite without ruining the heart of the series. And he still managed to give us the gruff reindeer for one ark in punk hazard by body swapping with Franky. Nami is another example of this. Her original design was a warrior with a big ass ax and mech arm. She was changed to the dainty cute girl design, and so he changed her fighting style to sorcery in order to keep the consistency of each straw hat being a fighter.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, his series was originally intended to be 5 years, but Shonen convinced him to drastically increase the time-frame and so he rethought the story. He added in the shichibukai, and split the grand line into two halves, which greatly fleshed out the middle. He did this instead of just doing his original plan then trying to add more afterwards like other manga writers have done. Think about how long he's had the Yonko saga in mind, but let it wait because he was smart enough to know that the end of the story needs to hold up. Kubo Tite, the author of Bleach, floundered when they convinced him to draw out his story and so the second half is absolute crap compared to the first half.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how conversations go at Shonen Jump of course, but I can't help believing that Oda is a shrewd negotiator who knew when to concede, and when to hold his ground. He kept enough freedom to write his story right, and played ball with the editors enough to stay the top author at Shonen Jump. I doubt they gave him as much creative freedom until after One Piece was #1.",58,1585320633,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fpy7fe/some_love_for_a_lesser_talked_about_talent_of_odas/,OnePiece,1

fpxf28,Seeker275,The Warlords &amp; Blackbeard," Continuing from where we left off, I know everyone‚Äôs all anxious over what will happen to the Warlords now that their system has been abolished. I also know there are tons of theories about it as well. As for me, I decided to reorganize on what we know so far and came up with my own theories on what happened. Oda himself said ‚Äúthings are going to be grim‚Ä¶ Hancock will‚Ä¶!! AAAAAAAA‚Ä¶!!!‚Äù

First let‚Äôs go over with what we know so far. As we all know the Warlord system was abolished during the World Summit, due to Riku Doldo III, Nefertari Cobra, and Fujitora citing the abuses committed on their countries by Donquixote Doflamingo and Crocodile, with the vast majority of votes agreeing. Blackbeard‚Äôs role in releasing all Level 6 Prisoners of Impel Down and attempting to sink Marineford might have also contributed to the dissolution. Another factor that contributed to the dissolution was when Fujitora and Ryokugyu brought up the Marine science unit working on a project known as SSG that is intended to replace the Warlord system. As a result, the Warlord system was abolished. Since it was abolished, the Navy wasted no time in attempting to arrest them. That‚Äôs probably what Mihawk was reading in the paper, hence why he sent Perona away for her own safety. True to the point the Navy arrived on Kuraigana Island. Vice Admiral Stainless arrived to arrest all of Buggy's Delivery. Edward Weevil is surrounded by the Marines at his current location. Lastly, Coby is on his way to Amazon Lily to capture Boa Hancock.

Now we come to my theories. First off, Buggy mentioned having his crew fight their way out, while in reality he, and possibly his officers, will slip away. It‚Äôs hard to tell what will happen, on one hand, Buggy‚Äôs got some crazy luck and he‚Äôs not entirely stupid, so he probably has an escape route all planned out. On the other hand he‚Äôs not very strong, and Stainless is a Vice Admiral, so chances are he might get captured, just like he was sent to Impel Down. Mihawk I‚Äôm not entirely worried about him, from what I‚Äôve seen he‚Äôs about as strong as Fujitora, and his sword is capable of slicing ships in half. Now for Weevil and Bakkin, we still don‚Äôt know that much about them, they‚Äôve only appeared in like a couple chapters/episodes. From an author‚Äôs perspective, Oda wouldn‚Äôt just introduce them and after appearing in a few chapters they already get caught. If Weevil really is the son of Whitebeard, now would be a good time to prove it. I still think Bakkin was once a part of the Rocks Pirates, if what she said about her and Whitebeard is true. Which brings me to Boa Hancock. Everyone‚Äôs all concern about her being a slave again, there are even rumors of her being chained up in Mariejois. I won‚Äôt disagree that something bad‚Äôs going to happen to Hancock, Oda himself said ‚ÄúHancock will‚Ä¶‚Äù meaning something‚Äôs going to happen. However, Hancock is very strong and Coby may have a hard time fighting her, I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôll be able to resist her beauty or not. She could evacuate the whole island and escape out to sea, but I don‚Äôt think Hancock‚Äôs the type that will run away from a fight. The way I see it, the only way Hancock gets caught is if she surrenders herself to the Navy in order to protect her people. Another way Hancock will get captured is if the Navy tests out the SSG, which was intended to replace the Warlords anyway. This will probably apply to the other Warlords as well, in order for the World Government to further establish themselves as an unstoppable force. However, there is one factor that I think we all missed. At first I was worried about Hancock being captured by the Navy, but after going back to Chapter 956, I don‚Äôt think the Marines are the only ones who are after her or the other Warlords. The person I think we all need to worry about is‚Ä¶ Blackbeard.

Why may you ask? Well let‚Äôs look at what we know so far. We know that the Blackbeard Pirates are currently hunting those with Devil Fruit powers and attempting to harness them for themselves. This was already proven when they killed Absalom and Shiryu has the power of the Clear-Clear Fruit. When Moria arrives to get revenge, Blackbeard invites Moria to join his crew, while Moria is both angry for Absalom‚Äôs death and terrified of Blackbeard‚Äôs power. But what stood out the most was this quote from Chapter 956: ‚ÄúOi! Boys! To sea! If they‚Äôre going to be picked up by the Marines, I‚Äôll just grab ‚Äòem first!‚Äù. I believe that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù are really the Warlords.

While we were all worried about Hancock being a slave again, I believe that she is actually going to be captured by Blackbeard. This would make a lot more sense because although both Hancock and Coby are strong, Blackbeard is stronger. Not to mention when Shanks was in Mariejois and he spoke to the Five Elders, he wanted to talk about ""a certain pirate"". I believe this ‚Äúcertain pirate"" is Blackbeard. This also coincides to when Rocks d. Xebec was introduced and Blackbeard‚Äôs flagship is called the ‚ÄúSaber of Xebec‚Äù. Obviously, there must be a connection between the two. But getting back to Hancock, her getting captured by Blackbeard will give Luffy more than enough reason to take him down.",4,1585317657,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fpxf28/the_warlords_blackbeard/,OnePiece,1

fpvrqs,redeagle51,Let's talk about Zoro.,"Yes i know another post discussing zoro's strength. Please bare with me for a while.

Can the people who are so adamant that zoro is not commander level give me one reason except he can't be because if he was that would mean he was stronger than luffy post timeskip.

Here are my reasons as to why i think he is commander level.

1. Zoro has still not gone all out post timeskip not even close i really dont like him getting enma before we saw his limits without it.
2. Many people use the birdcage as a counterpoint, the birdcage which even fujitora could not stop. I know a lot of people like to say fujitora wasn't really trying but i disagree why would he fuck around when civilians are in danger.
3. He still has not used asura post timeskip we dont know if he improved it so it may be even stronger than before.
4. This may turn up to be nothing but his eye, if he actually is keeping it closed by choice we don't what power he is hiding.

My point being we still don't know anything about how strong he is the biggest arguments people have is he can't be stronger than luffy other than that there is no reason to believe he is not commander level when he still has so much to show.
 
I'm mainly posting this for the people who are going to get mad if zoro fights king and ends up wining. Please keep an open mind we just don't know, we have not seen anything from him.",45,1585310662,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fpvrqs/lets_talk_about_zoro/,OnePiece,1

fpup4j,zdfc,Could Garp kill Akainu at Marineford?,"Time to settle this. Could Garp Kill Akainu at Marineford?  Vote!

My opinion is no. 

Garp was mad that Akainu killed Ace and brash people make imprudent remarks all the time. His emotions led him to say reckless stuff. Garp and Luffy has similar personalities and boldness. Luffy said he was going to kick Kaidos ass when he attacked his crew. Could he really do it?  I know the difference between the level of Luffy-Garp and Garp-Akainu is worlds apart, but it's just an example.

Let's look at BB's interactions with Garp and Akainu. We all know BB is calculative and knows his fights to take. At marineford, he had no qualm in fighting Garp and Sengoku, mocked them saying their era has ended and questioned if they could take him down. He was confident he could bring down Marineford. Granted Garp didn't really fight BB, he was ready to potentially deal with him cause there is no way Garp would just watch Marineford sink. He already got what he wanted (WB's devil fruit) and was basically just showing off. I am sure he knew Sengoku would have been fine with BB just retreating and not them fighting (Sengoku said get the hell out of marineford, and Sengoku is not the aggressive type). But he chose to fight and test his limits. However in another scene after the war, he ran away from Akainu like a total bitch when he saw him. Did he already get what he wanted (marine ship)? He also had his whole crew. He was even so scared of Akainu that he left Bonney behind, who he said wanted to make her his woman, just to distract Akainu so that he does not pursue him. That was how scared he was.

I would take prime Garp easily though. I like Garp but he is too old and Akainu is a monster. People put so much respect to the previous generation (Garp and Sengoku) and what the future generation is going to be (Coby). But they do not give respect to Akainu. He has some of the best feats in the whole series and is the head marine of this current generation, the one active in the story line. People just hate this guy because he is an asshole.

For me I gotta go with Luffy, Sanji, and Ussop vs Satori. Narratively, it does it‚Äôs job by introducing us to ‚Äúmantra‚Äù or whatever, but to me it just felt like it dragged on far too long with very little going on. Satori is one of the most annoying characters in my opinion, and so to have to watch him prance around and be basically untouchable for most of the fight was just really unentertaining. 

I also have... some issues with the Monet fight. Seems like a waste of a really cool devil fruit to me, considering she only gets about 2 or 3 chapters to actually be a threat.   The fact that Zoro cuts her down instantly definitely takes away from the tension of the situation. And tashigi... I just wanted better for her man.

fpstlg,ProCasual,What role would a new straw-hat even add?,"Before the Vivre Cards Databook outlined all of the strawhats with numbers 1-13 with the additions being Jimbe as 10, Merry as 11, Sunny as 12, and Vivi as 13 as a former member, there was a huge influx of threads talking about the next strawhat and **who** they would be (carrot a favorite) but never *what* they would be.

And the reason that's important is each strawhat is virtually perfect at their job and the story has made them absolutely essential because of their job. (Except brook but musicians are essential in their own way.) They are all unnaturally good at what they do and the story demand that a crew has that level of expertise. Luffy is the perfect charismatic leader, Zoro is the perfect swordsman (and the perfect first mate making decisions that the rest of the crew can't/wont but is necessary), nami the perfect navigator, Ussop is the best shot and Sanji is the best cook, chopper is a genius doctor, Robin is the only person who can decypher poneglyphs, Franky is a perfect shipwright, ~~Brook has bangers,~~  and Jimbe can litterally control any ship with one hand. 

Bit of a note from a wise man

&gt; historian isn‚Äôt a role exclusively made for sailing but it‚Äôs an occupation that broadens what the Straw Hats themselves are capable of. Instead of thinking what positions are still available to fill on a ship, think more on who‚Äôs someone that can help enrich the lives of the crew and expand their reach. u/mrdukedumas

So in that vien I can't imagine a lot of jobs that don't on some level overlap with what the straw-hats already have **and** enrich their lives, the common one was look out but 4 members of the crew have observation haki and Ussop has the ability to shoot across **islands** what better look out could you have? 

The only two jobs that I could imagine could be filled that don't overlap with the other strawhats

* **Tactician** \- Each of the straw-hats are smart but they never really have a plan (That is their style anyways so a strategist might not fit at all). But having someone who can plan around luffy's chaos to maximize the strengths of the other strawhats with the same level of success that Nami predicts the weather or ~~Brook makes bangers~~ , ussop hits his target would allow the straw-hats to have a level of strotegi that only Kinemon and Aizen have ever displayed. Both nami and robin are smart but to say you are a strategist the way ussop is a sniper or jimbe is a helmsman would mean you are military and planning genius. But even if we are being honest this person would be a secretary trying to balance luffy's craziness with logically planning so they are pretty unlikely.
* **Apprentice** \- The straw-hats have some of the most talented characters in the one piece world. it would almost feel to natural to have someone want to learn from them, looking from the outside in what is there to lose? It will be hard sure but the amount of skill and knowledge you would get from being a member of the straw hat crew is once in a lifetime.

fpsb9s,ProCasual,Momo vs orochi,"I don‚Äôt have a lot of support for this but it would thematically make sense if momo was the one to take down orochi. 

It would be the final kozuki kurozumi  fight and for those who think momo can‚Äôt do it isn‚Äôt so cut and dry. 

In the vivre card it was revealed that momo possesses Observation haki and has been training under zoro swordsman ship. 

Orochi has no haki nor does he have any skill with his sword (in his attempt to take down toko for laughing it was clear he has no idea what he is doing)

And while orochi has a mythical zoan momo also has the resilience granted from being a zoan user himself. 

Obviously there is a long list of people that have beef with Orochi but momonosuke is at the top. 

He took his rightful spot as shogun. 

Has his father murdered. 

Ruined his country. 

Brought kaido into wano in the first place.

fprkph,Small_Search,Law's devil fruit powers,"People say tha law donsnt use his powers efficiently and that he could have won in five secomds against doflamingo. 

Law used shambles on doflamingo 2 times, each time he caught doflamingo off guard, and after the second one he said that it won't work again. 

Now you may ask why he didn't swap doflamingo with the fish when they fought on the bridge, you may notice that when law swaps with pebbles, the pebble always appears in the middle of his body so the smaller object appears in the middle where the bigger object was, so doflamingo would appear in the air where that would give him time to sling back, even if he appears right over the water he can still sling back to the bridge.

Law's personality switch attack need him to hit the target with it to work and for another person to be there, all the times law manages to hit doflamingo with an attack nobody was present inside his room, also when he did it to the straw hats they were running away from him and sanji wasn't paying attention.

The reason law doesnt win againt everyone instatly is simple :Speed and observation haki, If you can dodge laws attacks they won't do anything and if he can't see you he can't actually shambles you since he can't get a good grasp of where you are, and even if he wanted to shambles you observation haki would help you dodge. 

All the times that law pulled off a shambles on doflamingo, doflamingo ether didn't know that law was there or was too angry to use observation (we know you need to be calm to use observation).

I am of opinion that strong enough armemnt haki can block only law's cutting attacks because eof what doflimgo said about vergo and the fact that law needed to get close to vergo to cut him, if he didn't need to get close then he put himself in danger for no reason. 

People almost assume that people can't dodge laws room attacks when obsrervation haki does exist. 

Offcourse if you were as pissed of as doflimgo your observation haki would be disrupted.

Tdlr: armement haki defends only against the slashing attacks of law's fruit. 

Observation haki and speed help you dodge all the other bullshit abilities like mes, shambles, personality swap...

So law would be good againt slow people who can't dodge and any one who can keep up with doflmingo would need someone to hold him down.

Remember that law used his hax attacks against foudder and his personality swap on the straw hats when they weren't paying attention and from behind.

If you believes it's a plot hole that dodging and observation haki are a thing then all the power to you.",1,1585287854,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fprkph/laws_devil_fruit_powers/,OnePiece,1
fprhyn,mbarakat81,Shanks!! from the void century??,"I have no idea why this has crossed my mind, but it every time i see Shanks i cant get the image of him crying in front of roger out of my mind, some said it is because he found out that roger is dying but i dont think that was the case!

things that makes me wonder, who is Shanks??

Shanks as far as i know has no information regarding his past life before he was 9, his hometown is said to be in the west blue i think, but nothing else is known about him.

he stopped the war and requested Ace and white beard bodies and had it his way, because he is ""Red hair Shanks"".

the 5 elders agreed to meet his because its him! what is he to them?

what made Shanks special so Roger would give him his hat? young Teach i guess said that they both (Shanks and buggy ) seems weak.

How did roger knew there is still a missing island and he is sure it is there!!!????

is it crazy to assume that Shanks was sent from the past, just as Wanos samurais were sent to the future?

and is even more crazy to assume the he is related to Im-Sama?  the He/ She \*\*Red\*\* eyes person? maybe she is his immortal mother who planned the war against her own ancient kingdom to gain immortality, and the one who sent Shanks did so to save him from her.

or ever crazier that they are a brother and sister/ brother and were sent to be saved, one ended up ruling the world and the other ended up on roger's ship searching the world looking for his missing sister/ brother?

could it be roger was certain there was still an island because Shanks told him about his past?

was Buggy the real reason why Shanks stayed and did not go to laugh tale? or is it because he chickened out and couldn't face his fears and waited Roger to ask him the questions he longed for their answers.

why did not Shanks aimed to reach laugh tale? and he settled with his position as a yonko?

Why did the 5 elders took no action when he met white bearded, and said "" \*But he is not a man who would try to upset the world himself. We will observe him without taking rash actions!\* ""

the questions Shanks asked roger what else could they be but questions about his past, and the tears he shed? why would a kid shed them for anything other than his own family?

I think Shanks continued looking for answers and he found Im-Sama, and that is the reason he is somehow special for the 5 elders, he decided to maintain the world on his way and the only way he knows, as a pirate...

he tried to stop Ace from chasing Blackbeard (maybe because he knows about the prophecy and thinks Ace who is Roger's son is the promised one, or maybe just because he knows he is Roger's son)

he also stopped the war because it has to stop!

anyway, all of what i wrote might be just a laugh tales, but one thing you guy must not let go, What did Shanks asked roger??

fprhf9,uknownada,A special moment for the end of One Piece,"I just imagined a really special moment.

So the One Piece manga has been over for a while now, and the anime is just now catching up with it all. Obviously doing a grand finale, but at around the same time, they also come out with a movie, perhaps from Oda's input, to really close off the franchise (before possibly a slightly mediocre spin-off). Naruto did the same thing.

The movie gets played around the country like the last few OP movies have, and big anime movies in general, with FUNimation of course tagging along.

Right after the epilogue maybe showing Luffy as an older, world-famous pirate, or even his happy execution, the credits roll.

&gt;(this is where the special moment begins)

a lone piano. Brook slowly walks towards it, and takes a seat. He starts playing those familiar notes: the beginning of Binks' Sake. As he plays, other instruments join in like the Rumbar Pirates. You hear ""Yohohoho~"" from all of the Straw Hats. Not long, the theater I'm attending starts singing along too! A passionate gathering of fans!

At the end of the first set of yohos, more voices are heard singing. It's other characters. Then the song really begins:

Foosha Village: ""Gather up all of the crew, it's time to ship out Binks' Brew!""

Orange Town: ""Sea wind blows, to where, who knows? The waves will be our guide~""

Throughout the WHOLE song, a look back on every single arc with each character singing the song! I can just hear the whole theater cheer at the fanservice as they sing the song and play along.

But then, near the end of the song, a different voice is heard, and the scene changes to live-action.

""Binkusu no sake wo, todoke ni yuku yo~"" the camera pans up. It's Eiichiro Oda. ""Kyou ka asu ka to yoi no yume~"" He sings Brook's brief solo during the original Binks' Sake scene. The theater doesn't speak Japanese, but some are still shouting loudly and some singing along, while a few stay quiet to give the moment to Oda. Not sure which one I would do.

After his solo, it cuts back to the Straw Hats to finish the song, and finally close the curtain on the franchise (before the possibly slightly mediocre spin-off). Thunderous applause.

The movie theater later gets complains from other showgoers because the fans were too loud.

Obviously that's a fantasy. Pretty sure One Piece is going to have a movie when the anime ends like Naruto did. Doubt they'd go that far with Binks' Sake but hey...it's nice to think about.",1,1585287422,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fprhf9/a_special_moment_for_the_end_of_one_piece/,OnePiece,1

fpr4ym,XShadicSJ,My thoughts on who could be the next Nakama,"I have a conflicted feelings about how many strawhats there are going to be in the end of the series.

There are 2 main possibilieties.

On one side, there is the theory that there luffy is going to have 10 nakamas , this theory is originated from 2 facts:

1-Luffy said he wanted around 10 Nakamas

2-Kurohige has 10 captains

On the other side however, we have the 13 nakama theory wich is supported with a lot of evidence, mostly foreshadowing, parallelisms, details and patterns that suggests that there are going to be 13 mugiwara on the end.

But then why there is conflict when the 13 theory has a lot more of evidence? Simple, time.

Because of time, the 11 theory is actually more likely, cuz if there where 13 then when would all of them join to not make it feel rushed or that they didnt spend enough time with the crew?

I still have hope that the 13 theory is possible but being realistic, is going to be 11

However, if there is any chance that there is going to be 13 Nakama then im pretty sure who those 3 missing ones could be.

I want to clarify that this is based on the 4/4/4 theory, for those who dont know this theory it says that luffy its getting 4 nakamas in each sea, 4 on east blue, 4 on paradise and 4 in New World

# 10th Strawhat-The Monster

This one is very obvious, even before he officially joined the crew it was easy to tell that he was going to be a member of the crew, we are talking about the great Jinbe

&amp;#x200B;

[Jinbe, Knight of the Sea](https://preview.redd.it/ks5cxsp265p41.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fbc066ea5ab2feed476ec8fafeb5afbc7798431)

What i find more interesting is the fact that he meets the requierements for the 4/4/4 theory and that is having paralelism with Zoro and Chopper, the first crewmate from each sea.

This parallelism being, 1-The three were considered monsters (Zoro because of his strenght, Chopper because of his appearance and Jinbe because he is a gyojin), 2-The three were chained during their first appearance.

Also Jinbe matches with a lot of patterns for the mugiwaras such as color theory, ab cd theory and cat theory

# 11th Strawhat-The Woman

For this spot i had 3 possibilities, but as the series progressed it came out to only 1

The 2 that I discarded were Vivi and Monet, Vivi because it is very unlikely that she travels with the strawhats again and Monet because the theories about her being alive are also very unlikely. Nonetheless, Monet would have been a great option but as soon as Dressrossa ended it became nearly impossible.

So the only one left is our dear Mink Girl, Carrot

 

[Carrot](https://preview.redd.it/rk3nx55h65p41.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05c37cdf0441a680fcbd2cd445b9f26955e4a6c5)

It isnt a surprise that she is the most likely from all of the characters on this list to became a strawhat (not counting Jinbe as he already is part of the crew).

She really doesnt have a lot of paralelisms with the other 2 women on the crew, but that doesnt really affect a lot since there are not a lot of girls, so it would be great to have variety

# 12th Strawhat:The Ship Upgrader

For this spot, as unlikely as it seems, there is only one option from teh characters we already know.

And that is the greatest scientist in the world, or atleast the funniest one

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Gangster Gastino](https://preview.redd.it/7zv5c6gz95p41.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01513c9e8a917f6bb42d6a444ebec77baf9ff948)

Wheter you like him or not, he has a lot of things in his favor.

He shares paralelisms with Usopp and Franky, such as being presented as the leader of a group or having skills for doing upgrades to the ship. He has a unique fighting style, as he would be the only Logia in the crew. He has been there since chapter 658, over 300 caps away.

The issue is that he is a villian and has done nasty things that wouldnt be forgiven easily. However this could led to an interesting story for him.

And something that I ask myself every chapter ¬øWhere The Fuck is Caesar? Like, we havent seen him since Wholecake, and he needs to be in Wano, after all, Kaido has the chemical weapons, and Caesar is the only one that can stop them. I hoped to know what happened to him in Bege Cover Story, but his is gone like Gas (shurororororo)

&amp;#x200B;

# 13th Strawhat: The Pervert

The last one is one that depends on another theory. That pervert could be Momonosuke, but he is a child and is very weak.

 Then who could be?.

But hey, why not Momonosuke?

This could be a stretch but I think Momo could join if the [theory of MarcoOPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VCC939m5n0) is right.

After all, he already is a pervert, he just needs the strenght to become a Strawhat.

&amp;#x200B;

fpqupx,BlueDreamandBeans,Discussing Wano so spoilers my dudes!!!,"I've been re-reading and re-watching the anime, specifically around my main man Jinbe-san. At first, I truly believed Jinbe would die or he would die in the Wano war that is about to engulf our lives. 

But lately, I've been thinking about it and now I see Jinbe coming into Wano with some dragon-level heat. Jinbe will be different, don't know how, maybe the eyepatch or limb missing, but Jinbe will be different somehow. He's going to be coming with someone big and no it's not Marco. I firmly believe Neko will bring Marco and the remnants of the Whitebeard pirates. Jinbe's bringing the sun pirates or the remnants depending on how WCI went. But these are the things I see in my mans future:

1. Jinbe will come with a new look into Wano
2. Sun Pirates will accompany him to Wano (for the big one, I'm leaning towards the SH Grand Fleet. I've tried to think of others, but this is the one that makes the most sense. When Jinbe leaves WCI, I believe he will run into the Grand Fleet already on their way. Luffy's vivre card has definitely without a doubt gotten smaller multiple times in WCI and Wano thus far. We have Luffy on WCI fighting off the BM pirates until Sanji arrives with food, Luffy vs Katakuri, Luffy getting baby-shaked by Kaido through his intro into the prison @ Udon.) This will be Jinbe's big moment as he comes back to officially join the straw hats and you know damn well we getting a team shot at some point.
3. Jinbe may receive a power-up or simply get stronger in the Wano battles. I say this because I truly don't see Jinbe dying until the final arc. He will be one of the essentials to winning the war. He has to travel with the SHs full crew and get to Elbaf.

fppdhv,GomuGomuNoKaio-ken,The final fight against Kaido,"With the raid on Onigashima finally beginning, I thought it'd be a good time to discuss the final showdown against Kaido. To make a long story short, I think the fight against Kaido will take place in multiple rounds.

Quick disclaimer: I wouldn't be surprised if I'm not the first one to bring this up. Just thought it'd be an interesting topic for discussion while we wait for next week's chapter.

Alright, so without further ado, let's begin!

If we take a quick look at previous arcs, we'll see that this isn't the first Oda has used multiple rounds to defeat the final villains. Some quick examples include:

* Alabasta: Luffy fighting Crocodile 3 times
* Thriller Bark: Oars facing off against the straw hats first before nightmare Luffy shows up to back them up
* Dressrosa: Law and Luffy fighting against Doflamingo (&amp; Trebol) before Luffy faces off against him alone in Gear 4th

&amp;#x200B;

Now in Wano, there has been no shortage of speculations for the final fight:

* Many have speculated that Luffy, Law, and Kid will take down Kaido together to represent the Worst Generation taking over the new era against the Yonko, as well as to make for up for the belief that Luffy may not be strong enough to defeat Kaido alone
* Others insist that Luffy needs to beat Kaido on his own to cement him as a fully-fledged Yonko-level pirate. Then comes the ""If it's one-on-one, Kaido will win"" line, it would be interesting to have someone (Luffy) defeat Kaido in a one-on-one to put an end to that reputation
* Some say that Zoro needs a moment to slash Kaido with Enma to showcase his strength compared to Oden
* Still, others suggest that Momo and the scabbards should fight him given how Momo was disrespected by Kaido in chapter [973](http://i9.mangapanda.com/one-piece/973/one-piece-13425205.jpg), as well as some parallels to the Momotaro legend.

&amp;#x200B;

While I don't necessarily agree with all of these claims, I do believe that many of them make sense AND could exist together. So how could Oda include all of these elements?

&amp;#x200B;

By having multiple people fight Kaido and giving Luffy the final fight.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've seen the Stampede movie, this would be similar to how &gt;!first, the Supernovas all fought Bullet, then we had the dream team of Smoker, Hancock, Sabo, Law, and Buggy (D. clown) fight, leading up to Luffy fighting him in the end, with a massive King Kong gun.!&lt; I imagine it would play out similarly with longer, more developed fights for each round.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm thinking something along the lines of:

* Round 1: Luffy, Law, Kid vs. Kaido
* Round 2: Scabbars support Luffy against Kaido
* Round 3: Straw Hats vs Kaido *(Here, Zoro can potentially slash Kaido)*
* Round 4 (FINAL FIGHT): Luffy vs. Kaido

&amp;#x200B;

Again, not all of these have to occur and maybe not in this order, but the concept would allow many of the key players to take a jab at the big boss, while still giving Luffy the chance to defeat Kaido alone in the end.

Let me know what you think!

**TL;DR:** I think the fight against Kaido will be in different rounds, similar to the fight against Oars and Doflamingo. This would allow different parties (Supernova, Scabbards, Straw hats) to participate while also allowing Luffy to deliver the finishing blow.",20,1585277815,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fppdhv/the_final_fight_against_kaido/,OnePiece,1

Luffy not only met them all, but made direct contact to them and almost every other top tier fighter in the world of One Piece.","Luffy has met almost all of the currently known strongest characters and had physical contact with almost all of them.

Top tier fighters of the current time line that Luffy met and the moment he came into contact with them:

- Shanks (as a child)
- Whitebeard (WB caught him after he got sent flying)
- Big Mum (Clash)
- Kaidou (Clash)
- Blackbeard (Clash)
- Rayleigh (During training)
- Akainu (When he got his scar and almost killed)
- Aokiji (When he got frozen)
- Kizaru (When he got kicked)
- Fujitora (Clash)
- Sengoku (When he got punched)
- Garp (Countless times)
- Dragon (No confirmation yet, but let's hope he touched his own son at SOME point in his life)
- Mihawk (Only one in the list that Luffy definitely only has seen and not had contact with yet)


Not including characters whose whereabouts and current status are unknown (e.g. Scopper Gaban), the only top fighters he hasn't met yet are Kong and Ryokugyu.

Garp and Sengoku are both held in high regard by the marines, and we've seen a huge number of Den Den Mushi that resemble their owners. Maybe the Golden and Silver Den Den Mushi were intentionally designed after them - Spandine's Golden Den Den Mushi was apparently even given to him by Sengoku himself as an admiral.

fpnnan,UltraBananaBuddy,Some Bounty stuff. Spoiler,"I've been thinking about bounties and there's some stuff I wanna talk about regarding them. First of all is Dragon's bounty. It's a huge mystery that hasn't been revealed by Oda. But I think we have a range to go by. I think that Dragon's bounty is somewhere between Whitebeard and Roger. So probably between 5.1 and 5.5  billion beli. I say this because Dragon has been called the most wanted man in the world since before the timeskip when Whitebeard still had an active bounty. It only makes sense being the most wanted would mean having the highest bounty, as bounties are basically the best way to measure how much the government wants someone captured or killed. The reason I say it's less than Roger is simply for story. Roger is the legend everything revolves around, he's the one Luffy's trying to surpass. As important as Dragon is to the story, his goals are secondary. This is about being the Pirate King. In fact the only characters I see having a higher bounty than Roger are Blackbeard and Luffy at the end of the series. You might be thinking that in chapter 957 Whitebeard and Roger were stated to have the highest bounties, but that was only among PIRATES, which Dragon is not, making it very much possible for him to have a higher bounty than Whitebeard at least.

That being said, I don't understand Sabo's bounty at all. 602 million seems way too low. Sabo is the second in command for the Revolutionary Army. This essentially means that if anything happened to Dragon, he would take over. He easily destroyed the Colosseum battlefield with a strike and took the Mera Mera no mi even when competing against Jesus Burgess, one of Blackbeard's Ten Titanic Captains, and likely one of the physically stronger ones. After getting Ace's devil fruit he easily defeated Burgess and more or less was on equal footing with Fujitora. With his strength and especially with his position, he should warrant a bounty in the billions. The only reason I have as to why his bounty is so low is that he's only recently been promoted to being Dragon's second in command and is a relatively unknown figure (besides name and face) to the World Government.

If anyone has some thoughts to this or any extra info I missed I'd like to hear it.",19,1585270927,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fpnnan/some_bounty_stuff_spoiler/,OnePiece,1

fpll3b,Rique47,The legend of the current generation's navy: Akainu.,"Before I start sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

 I see many people saying that the other common admirals are very close to Akainu, and they also say that the admirals are far above the first Yonkou commanders analyzing Akainu's achievements, but it is precisely for this and other achievements that Akainu must be the most admiral  strong.  Commander fights: Akainu simply had no difficulties and suffered any attack against one of them, managing to fight even after being wounded by WB against almost all divisions of commanders, and not even bothering with Vista and Marco's simultaneous attacks.  Being stopped only once by Marco.  Meanwhile on the side of the common admiral we have Aokiji was intercepted by a single third commander and only managed to get rid of him when he ended up being distracted.  The same happens with Kizaru, who was intercepted by Marco, and again only managed to finish Marco with the help of Kairoseki and depend on his distraction.  And Fujitora tries to get Sabo (who has not yet fully mastered his DF) out of his way, but he can't.  Arguments that the admirals were just playing or testing are not valid, if the difference were between 1st YC and ordinary Admirals it was as big as they say they would have got rid of the commanders without great difficulties, just like Akainu.

 Fight against WB: Akainu is the only one who came close to a real individual fight against WB.  Kizaru and Aokiji managed to intercept WB quickly, but Akainu had also done the same before facing WB individually.

 Now the achievements of the admirals: Akainu: His presence simply intimidated BB, a former Shichibukai and potentially Yonkou and the future greatest enemy of the Pirate King, along with his powerful crew of some pirates with incredible potential (Augur, Doc-Q  , Laffite ...) and the most powerful pirates of Impel Down who had made their name in history before (Shilliew, Devon, Vasco ...).  Aokiji: He intimidated the SH when not even one of them had Haki.  But he also managed to make Doflamingo back, but he must not even be in the 1st Commander.  Kizaru: Obliterated the Supernova in Sabbaody, but these were small fish even compared to old Rayleigh.  Managing to keep a fight with him, but that was not at its peak and was out of pace since he hasn't used his sword in years.  It has also humiliated Arlong, which is no big deal.

 Now the possible argument that many use to bring the other admirals together or just one of them to Akainu: The struggle for the position of Fleet Admiral: We already know that the fight lasted 10 days, and therefore many think: ""Aokiji has the fruit of ice  ! So he was clearly at a disadvantage and must have compensated with a better CoA or CoO than Akainu to balance the fight "". But it's not like that. Aokiji fruit is not Ice fruit.  Yes, ice is just one element within the real theme that Aokiji represents.  Each user has an ""epithet"".  This epithet is responsible for the theme of the power that the user will have.  And anything related to this theme will be addressed and used in the form of a poetic license.  For example;  Luffy is a Gomu ""Ningen"" (rubber man), ""rubber"", this is Luffy's theme, how he can stretch, compress and expand, all the licenses that the rubber theme brings with him Luffy will use to explore  .  In other words, every user of DF will be a human with their theme (rubber for example), and this is the real power within that theme, the rest are poetic licenses within that theme.  Aokiji is not a ""Kori Ningen"" (human ice).  In fact its epithet is labeled ""Hy≈çketso Ningen (Human FREEZING). Aokiji represents the force of nature, the phenomenon of nature to freeze something. And anything can be frozen, as long as it loses heat, including Magma being cooled.  the real capacity of Aokiji, cold vapor, his body being broken, or when his ice-shaped abdomen opens (WB Vs. Aokiji) are poetic licenses of the theme of his DF: Freezing. Not even his DF's name is ""Fruit  of the ice "", but"" Fruta do Frio ""(officially in the VIZ manga). It represents the phenomenon of things cogelando, and not just the ice, this is just one more detail of its power. Oda made evident the main effect after  the fight between Aokiji and Akainu: The climate change of Punk Hazard, which is why Aokiji managed to balance its fight against Akainu, it was a fight between two expert Logia users using their DF power to the maximum and balanced, Kuzan trying  freeze Magma and Sakaz  uki making Magma hotter and hotter ... But in the end despite his enormous powers of nature being in balance, resistance, strength, and maybe even Haki made a difference.  And due to the feats we saw in fights where Akainu proved to be very powerful, he ended up victorious in this confrontation, being well above the other admirals, being chosen to be Fleet Admiral and even one of Luffy's enemy and Finals, Being the legendary sailor  of the current generation, just as Garp and Sengoku were in the past.",16,1585263350,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fpll3b/the_legend_of_the_current_generations_navy_akainu/,OnePiece,1

&amp;#x200B;

I recently watched One Piece Stampede and while watching it this little EOS setting came to my mind so I thought about posting it to hear some other opinions on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now we have no Pirate King, Four Yonkos and of course the shichibukai (Anime).

At the end of the story Luffy will obviously be Pirate King but what about the four Yonko positions? if they remain at all..

I believe that at the end of One Piece the Yonkos will be:

\-Law, similar to Whitebeard a friend and rival of Luffy.

\-Kid, rival of Luffy but also in a more friendly way since they fought alot of battles together. 

\-Buggy, I mean yeah he rose to a way higher position than we all tought he would because he is Oda's favourite. So why can't he become a Yonko? I think he would be similar to Big Mom with a lot of alliances and underworld business. He would also be another ally of Luffy, like a hate love friendship.

\-And the 4th Yonko might be Boa Hancock,she is already very strong as stated by, has all 3 types of Haki and a whole Island of warriors under her regime. I think she would make a good Yonko as she is already called ""Pirate Empress"" ( might even be some foreshadowing , who knows).

This would also make all four Yonkos somewhat allies with the Strawhats.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Marines I share the common believe that Smoker will become fleet Admiral even if he needs a huge power up to gain that spot.

The three admirals could be:

\-Coby, this is a safe pick since it's his dream to become an admiral.

\-x-Drake, he was revealed to be a part of Sword and I believe that he is one of the ""Good Marines"".

\-Hina/Kuzan. Maybe Kuzan will come back to the Marine after the ""Evil Marine"" has been defeated. If not I could see Hina becoming the third Admiral by the end of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? I would love to hear some opinions or your thoughts on EOS characters?",4,1585261268,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fpl0p8/one_piece_eos_character_theory_short/,OnePiece,1

I don‚Äôt want a lot but the amount of time Sanji gets bailed out in wholecake by some random asshole is fucken annoying. We know Sanji can handle himself in a fight, he can outsmart his opponent at least or throw a wrench in the enemies plan but the only thing he does in wholecake is make a fucken cake? Honestly Oda pushed the pervert joke so much in the series that when he was having normal conversations with pudding I seriously couldn‚Äôt buy it. Why was he not going heart eyes? On top of all that he gets fucken shot by a bullet? A bullet? This far into the game? Sanji has one of the best observation Haki so far out of all the strawhats and he gets shot by a bullet.

So its the fan that decide who's in the trio, bcoz canonically there r like 5 moments of monster trio.

But I've seen people say Jinbei will replace Sanji, no post Wano Sanji will be stronger than Jinbei.

Jinbei, Zoro, and Sanji will be the new monster trio. Ok this is kinda reasonable many people want the gap b/w Luffy and Sanji/Zoro to be like how it is b/w Big mom and Kaido. Well its ok to have an opinion but I'm(my opinion) tired of this kind of stuff, Naruto and Sasuke can one shot people like Kakashi, Goku and Vegeta can one shot Gohan. So I want OP to be different. Also lets say if this happens I as a fan will still call them monster trio.Tho I know they will be on different tiers but the gap won't be that bigger as it is in case of BM and Katakuri.(I hope)

fpjkus,Pixel-Fun-Center,Question on Luffy vs Crocodile **SPOILERS***,"Hi all, 

I'm watching One Piece from the very beginning and enjoy the series quite a bit. Right now I am currently around episode 122 or so, after Luffy has fought Crocodile twice. So far the fights have been really fun, but one thing I wanted to ask:

Do they ever explain (maybe in this arc?) how Luffy survived being stabbed through his body against Crocodile's hook? It seemed like a major injury to him, and I wasn't exactly sure where he was punctured (I guess during his second fight it looks like his belly?). Now I know this is an anime like any other one, so you have to extend your imagination on stuff which is totally fine, but One Piece so far for me, has been pretty consistent on peoples injuries which I thought was neat, and maybe I'm missing something (or the manga explains), how Luffy survived such a huge injury.

fpevoa,sire59damos,I think we‚Äôre gonna see the regular version of G4: Tank Man against Kaido,"Now that Luffy can (possibly) use advanced armament at a regular rate, his damage output has been increased by a very considerable margin but whether or not his damage intake has increased remains to be seen. When Kaido and Luffy clashed, Luffy was beaten in one hit while he was in Bounce Man form. Now that he‚Äôs felt the power of an attack from Kaido, he knows he gonna need a better way to defend himself which is why I believe he will use Tank Man this time around.  Add advanced armament to this form of G4 and Luffy‚Äôs defense will have been increased by a considerable margin as well. 

Now I‚Äôm not saying that Luffy will now be able to brush off any of Kaido‚Äôs attacks like nothing, nor am I here to discuss whether it will be a 1v1 or a group effort, but when they do clash again, Luffy‚Äôs ability to take any hits from Kaido will definitely be a step above from when the first time they fought.",9,1585241318,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fpevoa/i_think_were_gonna_see_the_regular_version_of_g4/,OnePiece,8

fpdsev,mcanon89,[Name] D. Ussop,"As I have mentioned in my previus theory, I believe Ussop to be a D. This has been floating around, I believe, since Dressrosa- when he obtained the epithet of ""God"". Now not only am I going to lay out why i feel he meets all the criteria of a D (including from which parent he inherited it), but will also take a stab at his full name. However, before we get to that, we must take care of this whole D business. 

What do we know about D bearers so far? 
1) They are subject to fate, either shaping it, or falling victim to it.
2) They are said to ""Cause a Storm"" wherever they go
3) They, when they do die, will go out with a smile.
4) They are said to be the Enemy of ""God"".

I believe that, in a roundabout way, Ussop meets all four of these criteria. Let's go down the list, shall we?

1) Fate: I belive Ussop fits both criteria here. Let's be real here, Ussop is often dragged into each situation the Strawhats find themselves in because of Luffy, who by simple chance, landed on his island just in time to help him uncover a murder plot and save his friend. While you could say that fate landed Luffy right where he needed to be to score a soon to be world class marksman, it is also true that Fate gave Ussop just what he needed right when he needed it. Let us also be real in shaping fate. If not for Ussop, the Strawhats would not even been afloat long enough to reach Drum Island, let alone Water 7. Even after that, Ussop was instrumental in some of the Strawhats' more prominent victories. Notably, he took out Perona, who could have neutralized the entire crew in seconds. Most recently, he took out Sugar, twice, saving the one person on their crew who could read the poneglyphs, and his captain, respectively. So as a shaper and victim of fate, Ussop gets a Check.

2) They cause a storm wherever they go. This one is more literal. Two words: Clima Tact. Models 1,2, and 4 were Ussop' brain children. Yes Franky helped with Model #4, but his help was more technical. The concept and overall design were all Ussop. Yes, Nami is the one who uses it to make literal storms, but since Ussop was the one who made the Clima tacts, he is a key ""cause"" of the storms Nami made. Furthermore,  you could say thar Model 3, while not made by Ussop and likely by Nami, was based off of Model 2, can be attributed to Ussop. Storm causer, check!

3) They go out with a smile. This one may be the hardest to swallow, considering his constant bouts of the dreaded I'll Die If I Go to That Island Disease. However, I  have two pieces of evidence to work around that. First, let us consider other D bearers, Law and Teach, to be precise. Law rarely smiles. Most notably he did not smile when faced with Doffy or the prospect of an angry Kaido gunning for him. Teach has also been shown to cower when cornered, like when Whitebeard was still kicking after Teach and his crew pumped him full of lead. No, i think the bearer has to come the lucid conclusion that their time is up. That they have no other options and their fate is sealed. Such lucidity is hard to achieve in the heat of the moment. Should such a moment befall Ussop, I'm positive he will crack a smile. 

Second piece of evidence is his mother. We don't know much about her, just that as she lay on her deathbed, she smiled. This could be a case of putting on a brave face for her child, but that smile still  happened. It is my belief that it was Ussops mother that carried the inital and passed it onto her son. It is entirely possible that Yassop is a D, but we are looking at his mother for right now. Smiling in death, check.

4) Enemy of God. God, in this context has multiple meanings. First, and foremost are the Celestial Dragons. They are the ""God"", the ultimate power of the One Piece world. The second is kinda meta, but there are references to the God of Abraham, aka the Christan God. As anyone will tell you, God does not take kindly to other gods, or false idols as they often called. Furthermore, the Celestial Dragons would not take kindly to some lowly surface dweller running around being called God. While true he did not give himself that name, the fact that he now has a largr following calling him God would make no difference. This even cycles back into the whole victim of fate thing. Let us also not forget that in polytheistic pantheons, gods were known to beefs with eachother all the time, and Japan is no stanger to polytheism.  In this context, would have one ""God"" taking issue with another ""God"". This fits too well. Enemy of God, check!

5) Yes, 5. I forgot one. Inherited will. I dont think the Will Ussop carries is that of his mother, but that of Montblanc Noland. Consider this Ussop's main goal is to become a ""Brave man/warrior of the sea"". Before he set sail, he told Kaya that when he returned, he'd have more stories to tell her, but they'd all be true. As we've seen of him, this is Noland to a T. I would say that his will would be to to sail, collect stories, and most importantly as this was the impetus of his execution, for them to be believed as told to them. Ussop is well on his way to do exactly that. Inherited will, check!

So, with all four criteria filled, I belive we can say Ussop is a bearer to the Will of D. However, what is his full name? He is one of three Strawhats to not have their full name revealed. Nami, being adopted as an infant, is unlikely to have one, or the one she was born with. Brook is another example (one who actually fits all the other criteria as listed above), but our focus is Ussop. 

So what is Ussop's name? Stay with me here. A constant theme of Ussop is that his lies have a tendency to come true, from his signature cry that pirates were attacking, to his stories about a country of dwarves. These dwarves are important because the lie in question was told to the Dwarves. He told them that he was a descendant of Noland (which they bought, not only because if their own gullibility, but Ussop' helmet at the time). Now, as with all great lies, I think that there is a nugget of truth here. While I don't think he is descended from the Montblanc line, he descended from a Noland line. As in this is his family name, except that it isnt. No. I present to you Ussop's full name: Nolan D. Ussop.

Now, Kuma was former royalty and revolutionary turned slave for hire. He was the ultimate symbol for WG dominance. His slavery was a message. The celestial dragons viewed him as a luxury. So his death would definitely stir the pot. 

I think Sabo is being framed as the one who killed Kuma, that is why the revolutionaries are so horrified- how could Sabo kill someone so dear to them? I think Dragon doesn‚Äôt even believe that Kuma could be killed. After all he has immortal in his epithet.

On top of that, he realize how handy the suit is, which he needs to use to protect Nami and Robin, against stronger opponents, which pisses him off even more because he needs Germa technology in order to do so. Another sprinkle on that hate sundae, is the fact that he spent 2 years in HELL training and was still forced to use Germa technology. Cherry on top is the fact that Germa technology fulfilled one of his dream to become invisible, its great that the person he hates the most helped him achieve one of his dream XD.

fpb7dx,Samanaye,Akainu is Yonko Level And The Navy Could Take On 2 Yonkos,"Main arguments:

1. Akainu

The Navy went through some changes during the timeskip. Their new HQ is now located in the New World, making them actively compete against pirates. The Red Dog being their new leader, with his absolute justice motto, it's no wonder they are considered to be more powerful under him. Doflamingo even stated in his speech that the Navy is conquering the seas, which translates to that they are stronger than 1 Emperor crew.

The new fleet admiral is set up as being on par with the Four Emperors. Most people won't probably agree to this but there are a lot of reasons:

-Absolute Justice. While Akainu is quite powerful, what makes him truly terrifying is his sense of justice and his special hatred for pirates. This thus amplifies his power even more.

-Akainu's devil fruit is said to possess the highest offensive power of all fruits.

-He could find the One Piece in one year, according to Oda.

- His insane battle record in Marineford. Beat a second division commander with ease. While he didn't quite beat an old, sick Whitebeard, he did fairly well against someone who was considered to be the strongest man alive at that time. Took a hit from the quake quake fruit power at point-blank range and still survived. A freaking tank! Even after he got some beating from Oyaji, he was still able to continue fighting . Fended off Marco and Vista who were unable to even scratch him with armament haki. He then proceeded to take on Whitebeard's commanders (minus Jozu and some few weaker ones) + Crocodile. Guess what? He still couldn't be stopped.

- Blackbeard with the power of the quake quake fruit and his crew was scared shitless of the thought of facing Akainu. If Blackbeard can be Yonko level after two years, why wouldn't Akainu be on the same level when he could solo Teach's entire crew pre timeskip? I personally place Sakazuki above Kurohige. I think we can agree he is the weakest emperor as of now since he's relatively new.

2. Garp and Sengoku

These two are living legends.
Garp is seen as Roger's rival. They almost killed each other many times. He is past his prime, sure. But Garp is a healthier version of Whitebeard 2 years ago, maybe just slightly weaker. He should be at least as powerful as the admirals, just losing to stamina.
Sengoku I think we can assume is just a bit below Garp.

3. Current Admiral trio.

We've yet to see any of these 3 actually fight for real. Most people obviously can't wait to see Kizaru finally being serious. His feats are solid. He soloed a bunch of Supernovas. Went toe to toe with Rayleigh. He was basically chilling during the war of the best lol.
Fujitora seemed to be a bit of a disappointment in Dressrosa when he couldn't stop the birdcage. But that was just a stupid plot device by Oda and I believe he will impress us as we progress through the story. We don't know what happened with his fight against the RA but I'm guessing he and Ryokugyu managed to defeat them.

4. Momousagi and Tokikake

We've been introduced to new vice admirals after the timeskip, and they are stated to be strong enough to be admirals.
Even their aliases follow the scheme of admirals' code names.
Tokikake= Brown Pig
Momousagi= Pink Rabbit
Two admiral level characters more for team marine. That's a huge deal!
My personal theory is they will replace the current admirals later on since I think Oda is planning to kill at least 2 admirals in the story.

5. SSG

Although we know nothing about Vegapunk's new project, they apparently seem to be strong enough to replace the power vacuum left by the Warlords, at least according to Fujitora. They will play a vital role in the marine's power structure.

6. Aokiji most likely a SWORD member.

Since the revelation of X Drake being a SWORD member, there have been a lot of suspicion surrounding Aokiji being part of the group. What makes it more believable is the fact that 3 of the current Yonko group had at one point an individual revealed to be a spy for the WG.
Shanks - Shanks
X Drake - Kaido
Stussy - Big Mom
Blackbeard is the only one left and Aokiji would fit the role nicely.
If that turns out to be true, then that's a huge boost for team marine.


In summary, the entirety of the navy could take on 2 Yonkos at the same time. Both sides would obviously suffer a lot of damage but marines have an edge.

Navy vs Kaido + Big Mom match up:

Akainu + Sengoku &gt; Kaido
Garp + Tsuru &gt; Big Mom
Fujitora &gt; King
Kizaru &gt; Queen + Jack
Ryokugyu &gt; Katakuri
Aokiji &gt; Smoothie + Cracker

fpardo,G_STAR_4LIFE,Will Sanji be Yonko Level by the end of series?,"Honest question, I'm curious as to where people think EOS Sanji caps out? I personally have him at Marco Level or a little below that.

I've read others say that he'll be Admiral level so that he can compete against Kizaru. In my opinion that One Piece Opening with Sanji vs Kizaru gave everyone wrong expectations for Sanji. 

Sanji doesnt want to be the strongest anything, it doesnt make sense, narrativley, for him to compete against someone like Kizaru that can fight on par with Roger's RIGHT Hand, troll Old Whitebeard and destroy the entire supernova's all by himself. I think this idea of Sanji facing off against Kizaru stems from the fanbases undying resolve that the Admirals are weaker than Yonko. If the Admirals are weaker than Yonko then yes, Its plausible that Sanji will be Admiral Level by the end of series, but if they are the same tier strength then Sanji has no chance. 

I personally think the evidence points to the latter, When the marines found out that Big Mom and Kaido were meeting, they sent off Kizaru by his lonesome ( I know they were gunna send off a fodder fleet aswell but they dont count).

I could be wrong but I dont see Sanji touching Yonko Level. He'll definitely be top 20 by the end of series tho, maybe Katakuri Level...Maybe.

Please dont downvote me to hell for saying this, it's my opinion, I just wanna hear other peoples opinions and arguments to this.",45,1585226159,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fpardo/will_sanji_be_yonko_level_by_the_end_of_series/,OnePiece,1

...Have these games a good, deep playability? Are they compelling, as video games? I may be wrong but when I've watched gameplay videos, the feeling I've got is that they're rather shallow gaming experiences where you just smash buttons against hordes of mobs and then run in circles around the bosses hitting them when they stop between attack and attack. 

I have never played them so this is not a criticism: I may be wrong and they may be actually satisfying and have way more to them. So I wonder if someone can give me some input on the matter.

He took a direct attack from ancient zoan and came out with no damage. And He's INVISIBLE which is pretty op.
In the war sanji will have to fight against top tiers. Let's say he fights against queen or someone who are ancient zoan df users, he will have to cause a very great damage to hurt them.

fpa213,YouWHY,Did luffy actually just reach admiral level or above? (current chapters),"In a serious note..luffy training with seastone, this training probably gives him more endurance, improved his time limit on gear 4th and probably stronger punches but thats not just the case he also just got advanced armanent haki. What made me hyped is not only this stuff but he actually went to gear 4th and then went back to normal without any danger.

Some emperors like kaido/big mom and other top tiers haven't shown any signs of future sight so thats an advantage for luffy right here. Im not saying he is stronger than this yonkos ofc not but yh theres that. 

Luffy now has advanced armanent haki, observation haki completely maxed out (future sight). What would luffy need to reach admiral level or above? I just dont see what he can do.. maybe awakening? I think he needs awakening against the yonkos for now.

A lot of people got hyped after 975 thinking Bound man was Luffys new default fighting state. This isn't the case (probably. You can never be too sure with Oda.) Back at Sabaody, during the fight this chapter was mirroring, Luffy unnecessarily used third gear to beat up marine soldiers. It wasn't his default fighting state for sure, since back then he shrank after he used it, but he used it cause he was trying to flex on Kidd and Law. Same thing is happening here. They're all annoyed at not being the default strongest, so they're trying to show up.

fp54yi,AstralDoctorLN,Sanji and Zoro are evenly matched (973),"Yo guys I think now that Sanji has stealth black we can once again argue that he‚Äôs strong enough to be able to fight Zoro evenly to a stalemate.

Here is why me think this. 

Zoro being a really strong armament haki expert will no doubt be able to shrug off many kicks. Sanji on the other hand could not take more than a few serious Zoro techniques because Zoro is strong as fuck and has superior armament haki. 

Sanji despite the mad power disadvantage has become fast as fuck with his raid suit. He also has superior observation haki so his haki would make it such that he could endlessly evade Zoro‚Äôs attacks. Although Sanji‚Äôs attacks won‚Äôt cause Zoro much harm, his haki makes it so Zoro can‚Äôt harm him much either. 

Sanji might even have an advantage because his raid suit has crazy utilities and we haven‚Äôt seen the limits of his new power. Though the same could be said about Zoro since we haven‚Äôt seen his limits yet either, also enma. 

All this to say that I think Zoro and Sanji as of now could theoretically cancel each other out in a fight. Zoro vs Sanji could be a battle of wills that could last days in a similar way stalemate fights like Ace vs Jimbei or Aokiji vs Akainu lasted for days. 

I like this idea because Zoro and Sanji being equally matched just increases Luffy‚Äôs war potential even more. It‚Äôs raid time!!",26,1585196565,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fp54yi/sanji_and_zoro_are_evenly_matched_973/,OnePiece,1

fp4st3,masradenkun,(Spoiler) Zoro's powered up,"#ENMA

Enma didn't work like Raid Suit where it buff Zoro with no cost like someone who suddenly become hero after they got power ranger's transforming device. Enma just a sword that trained Zoro's haki like gravity room that boost Goku to frieza level in one arc.

I don't know why Oda didn't make Sanji's powered up like Luffy and Zoro that strengthen his haki. By the end of Wano, Luffy and Zoro's haki will be miles ahead of Sanji. But whatever Raid Suit is cool too, I'm power rangers, ultraman, gransazer, justiriser, kamen rider fan.

Back to Enma, by taming Enma, Zoro's haki will be advanced and stronger than before. If he managed to scratch even an inch on Kaido, it will be a massive feat for him (i believe he will land a blow on Kaido) and become the only living human to wound Kaido.

I created a web-comic called Barely a Hero - and this chapter (which mentions One Piece) talks about how the heroic ideal is not that accurate! A earlier chapter on the brain also has a devil fruit reference. 

[Barely a Hero](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/barely-a-hero/list?title_no=383804) is a more realistic portrayal of a loser who strives to become great - in contrast to the animes where the hero has plot armor and a lack of realistic obstacles.

fp27vl,KobeFanNumber24,Enma = Powerup?,"Do yall view Enma as a Power Up comparable to the Rajd suit, as in the sword itself gives Zoro a boost in stats like power speed the way the raid suit benefits sanji.... OR do you see enma as more of a training to strengthen zoros armament haki?

Enma was shown as this tough uncontrollable sword because it sucks the armament haki out of its user to perform strong slashes. So zoro getting enma is basically just him training with it, getting used to it while in the process strengthening his armament haki. Like it's not the sword itself based on its grade or sharpness that makes zoro stronger but more so the fact that it's so hard to control, the swords properties and character, and so the swordsman himself needs to be strong to even use it with full control. Sort of like a new method of training for zoro

fp2743,TailessTailedBeast,Some of the best chapters in One Piece are made even more epic in conjunction with soundtrack music,"On my second and third times reading the entirety of one piece, I matched up different anime soundtracks to different scenes while reading. It can be cumbersome switching back and forth between soundtrack and panels but it's worth it in my opinion. One of the best is matching up two specific chapters to the track:

 [A hero's desperation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLNx6rEwLTk)

The buildup in the track is epic and the trumpet drop sends chills down my spine. The two chapters I think are best appropriate for its use is chapter 81 and chapter 398.

**Chapter 81:**

*About:* Nami gets screwed over when she learns that Arlong is in cahoots with the marines and takes her savings. She breaks down and asks Luffy to help her to which he yells of course.

*How to use the track:* Time the trumpet drop at 0:58 with the panel with which Luffy screams ""of course I will"". The buildup of the track should match the panels in which Nami realizes she's been tricked, tries to stop the villagers, and stabs her pirates tattoo in anger.

**Chapter 398:**

*About:* Robin is captured by Cp9 at Enies Lobby and is so close to Luffy and his crew. She's scared that the Straw Hat pirates will abandon her but Luffy reassures her that she's a member of his crew. This is the infamous ""I wanna live"" chapter.

*How to use the track:* Time the trumpet drop with the panel in which Luffy has officially declared war on the World Government and screams ""I'd be happy to live with that"". Again, the buildup of the track should match the panels in which Robin is contemplating her situation, her history and Luffy orders Usopp to shoot the world government flag.

&amp;#x200B;

foy6pr,knutenffs,The Swan Pirates and its potential members,"This is a theory that I have thought for many years now but I still have not shared it!

It is based on which pirate crews and pirates I thought that potentially could join the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. Here I have thought about the nox pirates, sun pirates, kuja pirates, saryama alliance, rolling pirates and of course Mr.2. Some are more likely to join and some less but I am not going to discuss that in depth. Mr.2 could of course join one of the other crews in the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, but still I think the importance that Mr.2 have had in the story, that it would be most fitting that he would form his own crew. 

Of all this potentials one sticks out and that is Mr.2. All the other potentials have more fleshed out crews with more than just one named characters. And the Straw Hat Grand Fleet today have minimum 2 named or more characters on each crew. So then I asked myself the question who could then potentially join Mr.2 to form a pirate crew. Well they would most likely had to be in impel down to join the crew. This is where I think that Oda has through the story have sent named characters to Impel Down so Mr.2s pirate crew could be more fleshed out. I will name the crew the Swan Pirates since it is fitting with Mr.2 being the captain. I also think it is less work for Oda to use old characters if he were to establish the Swan Pirates rather than to introduce new characters.

Named characters that are most likely sent to Impel Down and could join the Swan Pirates:

Devil Dias: The slave that is trying to escape but his collar explodes. It is mentioned that he is either dead or will sent to prison.

Lip Doughty: One of the captains that signed up to follow the Fake Straw Hat Crew. It is shown that he is defeated by a pacifista.

Albion: Also one of the captains that signed up to follow the Fake Straw Hat Crew. Not shown that he is deafeated but he could potentially have been defeated offscreen.

Gyro: Pirate captain of the Gyro Pirates that tried to escape from Hody. They got beaten and sent up in a bubble to the surface in the New World where Smoker was waiting....

Brownbeard: Captain of the of the Brownbeard Pirates that we meet in Punk Hazard arc. He makes a deal with Smoker where they willingly will go to jail in exchange for getting treatment.

Then we have the Donquixote Pirates that all got sent to jail. But here I only see Senor Pink as a potential member.

&amp;#x200B;

How and if this comes to fruition I have no idea. But for the final war I think we will see many of the characters we have met through the story and this one of the ways I would love to see them reintroduced. Maybe I am going to deep down the rabbit hole of theories, but I really liked this theory and wanted to share it.",0,1585170139,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/foy6pr/the_swan_pirates_and_its_potential_members/,OnePiece,1

fox80c,EMC1894,Thoughts on the arc following Wano,"I‚Äôve been thinking about Luffy‚Äôs progress post time skip.
When Rayleigh and Luffy began training, Rayleigh explains that there are two types of haki, observation and armament - and some people are born with the ability to use a third kind called Conqueror‚Äôs haki.
After Dressrosa, Luffy‚Äôs pretty much showed us all the things he‚Äôs learned as a result of his training with Rayleigh: the ability to use all 3 haki, and gear 4th (including its variations, as far as we know).
WCI is where we first see that Luffy‚Äôs training with Rayleigh isn‚Äôt enough anymore, with Katakuri‚Äôs superior observation (and above  average armament) haki. The arc results in Luffy‚Äôs observation haki evolving into the ability to see just a bit in the future.
In Wano, Luffy‚Äôs armament haki isn‚Äôt strong enough to make a dent on Kaido, and we see that Luffy‚Äôs training in prison with Hyogoro is showing some next level armament (the ability to move your haki into what you‚Äôre hitting and doing damage from the inside? That‚Äôs my understanding, someone explain it better than me, please!).
So now I‚Äôm getting to my point. I have a feeling that Luffy (with maybe the help of Shanks or even Rayleigh coming back?) is going to make a leap in his ability to use Conqueror‚Äôs haki.

Here‚Äôs my reasoning:
1. So far the chronological order Luffy‚Äôs advancement in haki (observation in WCI, armament in Wano) follows the order Rayleigh introduces haki to Luffy (observation, armament, conqueror‚Äôs).
2. We know that there is a next step in Conqueror‚Äôs, as we‚Äôve seen Shanks‚Äôs haki do some physical damage to Whitebeard‚Äôs ship.

Curious what everyone thinks!

TL;DR: I predict Luffy will take his conqueror‚Äôs haki to the next level in the arc following Wano, based off WCI and Wano.",26,1585166927,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fox80c/thoughts_on_the_arc_following_wano/,OnePiece,1

fow2c9,sombrero69,really excited for Onigashima,"We'll most likely head there in the next chapter. what i'm most excited about is that we'll finally see the entire beast pirate crew, all of the flying six and the numbers. ik it will be a while until we see their powers and devil fruits but their designs and names will be enough for now.

I bet the flying six will continue the ancient zoan dinosaur theme we already have a spinosaurus and an allosaurus. i would love it if the rest of the tobi roppo were a triceratops (zoro's opponent?), a velociraptor, an ankyolsaurus and a stegosaurus but ik how much people love an old fashioned T-rex so maybe a T-rex instead of the stegosaurus. X drakes fruit is pretty similar to a T-rex just with the size difference. the velociraptor should be quick and the ankylosaurus should be tanky and pack a punch with that tail swing. here are all the different dinosaurs if you don't remember how they look.

I don't really see the numbers having ancient zoans because that would not make them as rare having all the ancient zoans in one crew and them reaching 18 ancient zoan users (3 calamaties and 6 FS + 9 numbers) is a very close number to the 28 known regular zoan users. they could be from a race we haven't seen before which would be really cool with paramecia fruits just for variety's sake, ik it would fit the theme but just to change things up.",11,1585163145,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fow2c9/really_excited_for_onigashima/,OnePiece,2

fotwcj,illinest,Nami is the real MVP here,"I believe that there must be a massive amount of behind the scenes planning and deal-making going on to support the crew's ambitions, and I believe that Nami is doing the bulk of that work. 


I'll go ahead first and credit Luffy for his leadership skills. That's an established plot point and I'd say that he's got to be doing even more than what the reader sees, not only managing egos but motivating and providing direction, etc... People don't risk their lives for unexceptional men. There's got to be a ton of Luffy leadership moments that get cut out and left on the editing room floor. His apparent idiocy - frequently played up for comedic effect - masks his brilliance.  But Luffy has also demonstrated a clear distaste for micromanaging important details. 


So who maintains contact with the fleet of pirates that pledged themselves to Luffy? Who handles supplies for the ship? Who keeps track of Luffy's constantly expanding list of allegiances and enemies? Why is it that only a small list of enemies have ever tracked them down, to go along with a million other little mysteries? 


Some of these duties I would say are certainly shared - particularly with Usopp, Sanji and Franky. Nami is not the only intelligent and competent planner in the crew, but she does have a leg up on the others due to her experience working for Arlong. Experience is a big part of my argument, and she was directly involved in the management of a major crew at the same time that Usopp was managing a few children and Sanji (presumably) was managing a kitchen. Franky was the boss of a gang of thugs which is a feather in his cap, but he seems happiest when his responsibilities are limited to fighting and taking care of the ship. He doesn't have the same hunger that drives Nami.


And Nami is ravenous. If you look down through the list of crew-members I think she's one of the only ones that I can't imagine doing anything else aside from being a pirate. Sanji could retire as a chef. Chopper, Franky and Brook have obvious alternate career paths. Robin is explicitly a scholar. Even Zoro and Usopp I think could do what they do without needing to sail under a Pirate flag, but Nami... I don't think so. I think she loves the grift. I think she's capable of making money legitimately, but I think she's got a little too much adventure in her. I think Nami is the one crew-member who would definitely find another crew if she couldn't sail with Luffy anymore. She's too valuable and too good at what she does, and I think she loves it. 


As I see it, she's basically second in command under Luffy. I think she works closely with Usopp to manage the day-to-day operations, with frequent contributions from Franky and Sanji. I think Zoro exists outside of the chain of command as Luffy's top lieutenant, but I think his contributions are generally limited to fighting things and lifting things. I doubt that the chain of command on Luffy's ship would ever be explicitly spelled out as I've attempted to do here, (in fact I bet Luffy would hate this) but I think that the crew probably naturally falls into this structure more often than not. 


Would it all work without Nami? I don't believe so. It's not necessarily a matter of competence (though the crew would definitely need a replacement navigator) so much as it's a problem with motivation and personality dynamics. Imagine Franky or Usopp trying to keep Sanji and Zoro from fighting. (I think Franky would join in!) Or imagine Zoro having authority over Sanji, or vice-versa. I just don't see how it would work.


I suppose it's not exactly fair to say she's the MVP because it's a team effort, but I do think that she contributes more drive and direction than anyone else except Luffy. I think more of her work gets off-screened than any other character and I don't think she gets nearly enough credit.

forglk,MikeSlav,Hello! So I started getting really interested in One Piece recently...,"I was planning on starting it today but I just can't decide whether to watch the anime or read the manga!! I've watched the first episode and read the first chapter and I'm liking both.

I've seen a lot of debates and whenever I think that one is better than the other, I find someone else that proves me otherwise... I don't have a problem with black and white manga cause there are over 800 chapters of colored manga, but I really like each characters voices. I usually make up characters' voices in my head while reading manga but I don't think I can do that for over 800 characters!

Oh and there is also the pacing and filler. I don't care about the filler, I can watch it completely fine. But the pacing seems kinda annoying. I watched a bit of the latest episode to see how bad it actually is and I was surprised to see how noticeable it is. There like a 1 second pause after everything someone says and sometimes there is too much zooming in and freezing on people's faces for no reason.

What do you think? Manga or Anime? If anyone even replies to this post, please explain why you think one is better than the other and why I should go with that one instead.

fopnzv,urveen257,Im Sama's real Identity,"I believe Roger surrendered himself for execution to the marines, because he turning into into Im Sama (a manifestation of Xebec). IM is THE disease itself caused by ROCKS D XEBEC to to Roger in his battle on God Valley.

IN CHAPTER 957 - Sengoku states while Garp Earns His Title as ""Hero of the Marines"" from The God Valley Incident after he defeated the ROCKS Pirates, however because Garp allied with a pirate (Roger) he is unwilling to talk about it. I believe Sengoku's explanation of why Garp doesn't like to be addressed as the hero of the marines is a little misleading. Yes while it is true, Garp doesn't like to talk about the God Valley incident because of Roger, Sengoku's explanation is NOT THE REAL REASON. The truth is, Roger was the real Hero of God Valley, Roger must have saved Garp's life, yet Garp got all the credit (ie the HERO TITLE) - When in truth a Pirate risked his life to save a Marine Vice Admiral. Garp is like smoker, he doesn't like FALSE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. Xebec's final attack was probably aimed at Garp, and Roger jumped in and Tanked it instead. Roger saving Garp's life resulted in Roger getting a incurable disease (from XEBEC's Devil fruit) resulting in Xebec's will to manifest in Roger. Also the guilt of Roger risking his life, to save an enemy like Garp resulted in Garp honouring Roger's last wish for Ace to be Adopted by Garp, because he OWED ROGER.

While Im has taken over Gol D Roger, I believe Im is NOT Gol D Roger himself. I do however believe Im has retained Roger's physicality, style of fighting, strength as well as his memories - Which would align with why Im is willing to let Ace (his own son) die, because Im isn't Roger, More Xebec than Roger so to speak. [Also theres a possibility that Im visited Ace in impel down to give him the option to join him and Ace refused to accept him as his father, acknowledging Whitebeard (Shirohige) instead though I think this part PROBABLY DIDN'T HAPPEN.]

I believe Oda has been giving us tiny clues that Im is indeed Roger. Firstly lets take a look at Im's throne https://ibb.co/r37gXpy Is there a Pirate we know with the same taste for those colours? https://ibb.co/4JrVZxD Still not convinced? No worries, take a look at the colour of the Oro Jackson. https://ibb.co/sVTShK3

ODA has been foreshadowing that Roger is alive (through Im), under the pretext that his will has been passed on. https://ibb.co/yg93P5X Remember Roger's speech to Rayleigh? ""Don't worry Partner, I won't die""

As you can see Roger and Im have alot of similarities; 1) both have been called King 2) Same taste for colours 3) Both have the same fighting style preference (using of sword) 4) Both are invested in the Will of D (Im has pictures of Luffy &amp; Blackbeard who are the 2 most prominent D's in the current storyline)

Now lets talk about what has happened in the present one piece storyline that makes this theory probable. So we've seen that shanks reports to the Gorosei, about Blackbeard. This raises 3 questions.

Question 1- Why would Shanks report Teach to Gorosei, we already know Shanks is more than strong enough to deal with Teach and his crew himself?

I mean you don't have double a person's bounty only to be weaker than that person. I believe Shanks is under the control/ order of the World Government specifically Im (formerely Roger) himself not to take any action on teach.Rather it is Shanks duty to report any intel to the Gorosei, Roger's messengers.

Question 2 - With Roger gone, and Shanks not having been on Roger's last voyage to find the One Piece, why hasn't Shanks attempted to find the one piece in order to become Pirate King by now?

Kid Shanks clearly stated in flashback - that he will one day assemble his own crew to find the One Piece. So it seems out of character, he has completely forgotten his goals and objectives. I believe theres a good reason for this, which is that Shanks hasn't attempted to find the One Piece and become Pirate King is because Roger is Im Sama himself (Shanks is clearly aware of this that is why he reports his intel to the gorosei who are the direct messengers of Roger/Im), It would be disrespectful to the real pirate king (Roger) himself if Shanks started letting others call him King - while he knew Roger was the real king ruling from the shadows.

Question 3 - Why would Shanks risk his life meeting the Gorosei?

Surely Marejois is guarded by some of the strongest marines. Theres always a possibility they refuse to let Shanks leave and execute/imprison him right then and there. From all the hype the Gorosei should at least be Admiral Tier themselves, and there were 5 of them and 1 of Shanks. Shanks still somehow felt comfortable around them (WHILST UN ARMED), which shows those guys have a professional and good working history seeing as they were talking to each other so casually.

Lets take a look at Marineford War. Shanks arrived after Whitebeard was already dead and somehow was able to end the war. Had the war not been called off, lets take a look at who Shanks would've had to fight. AOKIJI/AKAINU/KIZARU/GARP/SENGOKU/TSURU/Blackbeard. Garp feats alone from 957, shows that he by himself could probably give Shanks a hard time. So when you take into account the other 4-5 admiral Shanks would've had to fight there is no way Shanks got out of there alive (even with his amazing crew). Yet the world government (specifically Sengoku) chose to end the war. why? They had just lured Shanks out of his territory and onto theirs, where they had the upper hand (as well the 4-5 of the 7 schibukai) I believe these actions are consistent with Shanks working for the WG, Roger/Im specifically. Shanks was able to stop Kaido from coming to Marineford, I don't believe its because Shanks is stronger than Kaido. Kaido won't even listen to Linlin (another Yonko who was his former crew member - who once saved Kaido's probably from Captain Rocks himself - who probably got angered by Kaido's incompetence as an apprentice pirate). I believe Shanks somehow proved to Kaido that Roger was alive, and ready to kick his ass just as he did to Kaido's Captain back on God Valley (the only Man Kaido has ever FEARED). This led Kaido to pull off his attack on Marineford.

So what happened in the One Piece story was this, Roger was dying from some incurable disease as we know. We are also given information that no doctor could heal him. Now this is where things get blurry, either 1 out of 2 things happened. Roger got desperate to pro-long his life and ate a devil fruit like Trafalgar Law (ultimately transforming him to Im sama OR The illness Roger had is what made him into Im sama (ie he never ate a devil fruit). My best guess would be that he did eat a devil fruit. Because we know Roger was strong, if he could pro-long his life, theres no doubt he would've done it. So why didn't he? Unless he did, and it just hasn't been disclosed yet. I believe Roger ate a devil fruit to survive the incurable disease he had at the expense of losing himself. Realising his mistake, he thought by surrendering himself to Marines for execution could fix his error.

The theory Roger being Imu It would explain why the Im sama's sword looks alot like Roger's weapon. Also, https://images2.alphacoders.com/105/1057864.jpg Roger was a swordsman, hence the fascination with all the swords surrounding the throne in Marejois. I doubt ODA would make Luffy's strongest opponent in one piece a character (Im Sama) an UNKNOWN, ie someone we haven't heard of. Theres no hype towards making the strongest antagonist in in One Piece an unknown character with zero hype.

One Piece is supposed to be all about Luffy being the greatest pirate of all time. But there will never be a universal agreement that Luffy surpassed Gol. D. Roger, people will always make a debate that Roger is stronger than Luffy - So Oda's solution is to make Luffy fight Gol.D.Roger Through Im sama, this is ODA's way of showing Luffy has indeed surpassed Roger. Up to the current point in the story Roger is probably still the strongest character introduced (Some might believe Captain Rocks tp be strong, but that is speculation for now). When we look at some of the ways at how the some of the strongest characters in One Piece so far have died, people like Oden, Ace, Whitebeard etc NONE of their deaths have have been instant upon receiving their wounds (regardless how FATAL the wound was). Yet Roger, the strongest of them all died INSTANTLY in the middle of a speech, he was trying to finish. I'm sure Roger who carried the WILL OF D, was strong enough to at least survive another 5 seconds to finish his sentences on his execution platform. Hell, I mean ace did it with a giant hole in his body. Lets further examine how Roger died, 2 sword wounds through each of his shoulder. Were these wounds Roger got from the execution platform really more fatal than Whitebeard's 200+ Gunshot/Cannon Wounds+ His 20+ HEART ATTACKs, Giant Holes in Chest? Even someone like Ace's wounds should've killed him instantly, knowing that he is a D, he was able to last a bit longer to give luffy his final goodbye speech. Even ODEN himself LASTED HOURS IN A 1 million degrees boiling heat from a hot pot. So how come ROGER died instantly? I believe this was a ruse by the World Government. They had no plan for killing Roger. They were willing to lie for Doflamingo regarding him resigning from the 7 warlords, it seems in character with them to lie and say they killed Roger. If everything up to this point still hasn't convince you. LET ME POSE 1 FINAL QUESTION TO YOU, WHERE IS ROGER'S BODY - I mean where did they bury him - Why is oda being so secretive about where Roger has been buried? What possible significance could there be from hiding where Roger is buried, other than Roger being Im himself.",10,1585140327,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fopnzv/im_samas_real_identity/,OnePiece,1

Now lets talk about what has happened in the present one piece storyline that makes this theory probably. 
So we've seen that shanks reports to the Gorosei, about Blackbeard. This raises 3 questions. 

Question 1- Why would Shanks report Teach to Gorosei, we already know Shanks is more than strong enough to deal with Teach and his crew himself?

 I mean you don't have double a person's bounty only to be weaker than that person. I believe Shanks is under the control/ order of the World Government specifically Im (formerely Roger) himself not to take any action on teach. 

Question 2 - With Roger gone, and Shanks not having been on Roger's last voyage to find the One Piece, why hasn't Shanks attempted to find the one piece in order to become Pirate King by now?

 Kid Shanks clearly stated in flashback - that he will one day assemble his own crew to find the One Piece. So it seems out of character, he has completely forgotten his goals and objectives. I believe theres a good reason for this, which is that Shanks hasn't attempted to find the One Piece and become Pirate King is because Roger is Im Sama himself (Shanks is clearly aware of this that is why he reports his intel to the gorosei who are the direct messengers of Roger/Im), It would be disrespectful to the real pirate king himself if Shanks did that. 

Question 3 - Why would Shanks risk his life meeting the Gorosei? 

Surely Marejois is guarded by some of the strongest marines. Theres always a possibility they refuse to let Shanks escape and execute/imprison him right then and there. From all the hype the Gorosei should at least be Admiral Tier themselves, and there were 5 of them and 1 of Shanks. Shanks still somehow felt comfortable around them, which shows those guys have a professional and good working history seeing as they were talking to each other so casually. 

 
Lets take a look at Marineford War. Shanks arrived after Whitebeard was already dead and somehow was able to end the war. Had the war not been called off, lets take a look at who Shanks would've had to fight. 
AOKIJI/AKAINU/KIZARU/GARP/SENGOKU/TSURU/Blackbeard. Garp feats alone from 957, shows that he by himself could probably give Shanks a hard time. So when you take into account the other 4-5 admiral Shanks would've had to fight there is no way Shanks got out of there alive (even with his amazing crew). 
Yet the world government (specifically Sengoku) chose to end the war.  why? They had just lured Shanks out of his territory and onto theirs, where they had the upper hand (as well the 4-5 of the 7 schibukai) I believe these actions are consistent with Shanks working for the WG, Roger/Im specifically. Shanks was able to stop Kaido from coming to Marineford, I don't believe its because Shanks is stronger than Kaido. Kaido won't even listen to Linlin (another Yonko who was his former crew member - who once saved his life my guess is probably from Captain Rocks himself - who probably got angered by Kaido's incompetence). I believe Shanks somehow proved to Kaido that Roger was alive, and ready to kick his ass just as he did to Kaido's Captain back on God Valley (the only Man Kaido has ever FEARED). This led Kaido to pull off his attack on Marineford. 

I believe what happened in the One Piece story was this, Roger was dying from some illness as we know, and he got desperate because no doctor could heal him. Thats why he ate some devil fruit to prolong or possibly cure himself. I believe this devil fruit has something to do with the red eyes of Im sama (to survive the disease). 

Roger was strong, if he could pro-long his life, theres no doubt he would've done it. So why didn't he? Unless he did, and it just hasn't been disclosed yet. I believe Roger ate a devil fruit to survive the incurable disease he had. 

It would explain why the Im sama's sword looks alot like Roger's weapon. Also, https://images2.alphacoders.com/105/1057864.jpg Roger was a swordsman, hence the fascination with all the swords surrounding the throne in Marejois. I doubt ODA would make Luffy's strongest opponent in one piece a character (Im Sama) an UNKNOWN, ie someone we haven't heard of. Theres no hype towards making the strongest antagonise in  in One Piece an unknown character with zero hype. Alot of people seem to speculate Im is Captain Rocks D Xebec, if IMU was indeed ROCKS, he would've taken revenge on GARP by now (sent an assassin execute him or someshit like they tried with Doflamingo). Also no reason for Shanks to be reporting to him, Shanks was Roger's guy.

One Piece is supposed to be all about Luffy being the greatest pirate of all time. But there will never be a universal agreement that Luffy surpassed Gol. D. Roger, people will always make a debate that Roger is stronger than Luffy - So Oda's solution is to make Luffy fight Gol.D.Roger/ Im sama is his way of showing Luffy has indeed surpassed Roger. Up to the current point in the story Roger is probably still the strongest character introduced (Some might believe Captain Rocks tp be strong, but that is speculation for now). When we look at some of the ways at how the some of the strongest characters in One Piece so far have died, people like Oden, Ace, Whitebeard etc NONE of their deaths have have been instant upon receiving their wounds (regardless how FATAL the wound was). Yet Roger, the strongest of them all died INSTANTLY in the middle of a speech, he was trying to finish. I'm sure Roger who carried the WILL OF D, was strong enough to at least survive another 5 seconds to finish his sentences on his execution platform. Hell, I mean ace did it with a giant hole in his body. Lets further examine how Roger died, 2 sword wounds through each of his shoulder. Were these wounds Roger got from the execution platform really more fatal than Whitebeard's 200+ Gunshot/Cannon Wounds+ His 20+ HEART ATTACKs, Giant Holes in Chest? Even someone like Ace's wounds should've killed him instantly, knowing that he is a D, he was able to last a bit longer to give luffy his final goodbye speech. Even ODEN himself LASTED HOURS IN A 1 million degrees boiling heat from a hot pot. So how come ROGER died instantly? I believe this was a ruse by the World Government. They had no plan for killing Roger. They were willing to lie for Doflamingo regarding him resigning from the 7 warlords, it seems in character with them to lie and say they killed Roger. If everything up to this point still hasn't convince you. LET ME POSE 1 FINAL QUESTION TO YOU, WHERE IS ROGER'S BODY - I mean where did they bury him - Why is oda being so secretive about where Roger has been buried? What possible significance could there be from hiding where Roger is buried, other than Roger being Im himself. I don't see how it can be a coincidence that both Roger and Im have been referred to as Kings.",2,1585133192,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/foo8cw/im_samas_real_identity/,OnePiece,1

fonkzv,ZGMF-X09A_Justice,Can you see Sanji ever using his hands in combat?,"So one of the most commonly brought up points about Sanji's fighting style is that he is very vulnerable defensively because he just refuses to use his hands, aside from supporting his handstands. I think it can possibly be the ultimate instance of him sacrificing what he stands for-being a cook-so that he can better protect his friends, and could greatly improve his defense. Whenever Sanji is forced to block an attack instead of dodging, he is forced to stand on one leg  while the other is used as a shield, which can greatly limit his chances to counter. This might be mitigated if he used his hands. Sure, the Raid Suit adds to his durability, but it won't be enough all the time and he can't always just risk taking an attack hoping that the Raid Suit can tank it.",28,1585129525,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fonkzv/can_you_see_sanji_ever_using_his_hands_in_combat/,OnePiece,1

foligs,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapters 29-32: Neko Pirates vs Luffys Crew Begins!,"Yes, this is my first time reading One Piece

The chapter starts with Usopp facing down the Neko pirates, and also wondering how the fuck Luffy got lost. Usopp says an obvious lie and Jango somehow falls for it, which was pretty funny. The Neko pirates discover all the treasure Luffy's crew has, and as if on cue, Nami shows up. Usopp tries to trick Jango, which he surprisingly doesn‚Äôt fall for. Nami arrives and gets pissed at Usopp, and Jango's hypnotism gets told to Usopp. I do wonder how he didn‚Äôt already know about it though, considering he saw Luffy get hypnotized. There‚Äôs a great moment where Nami and Usopp are just standing and arguing about who should attack first while the Neko pirates just stand there awkwardly. It does definitely feel like the strength gap between Luffy's crew members right now is pretty big, with Luffy and Zoro being far above Nami and Usopp in terms of combat. But I guess Usopp and Nami actually have skill sets outside of pure combat, which probably makes up for it. Usopp grabs some spikes from his pocket and the battle resumes. 

&amp;nbsp;

We cut back to Zoro at the bottom of the oil pit. He‚Äôs able to hike up with two swords, and at the same time Luffy is still getting lost (seriously how does he not know which way north is). Nami and Usopp (well basically Usopp) seem to be doing alright, until Nami realizes she somehow threw the spikes behind them, and Usopp gets smashed with a stone axe. First of all, Usopp not getting knocked out after a hit to the back of the head like that is actually pretty impressive. Second of all, this scene is really nice. This is probably the lowest point of this battle, with Usopp down and the two strongest fighters still making their way over, and I think Oda writes this scene of Usopp desperately defending the village very well. Also the fact that this is the point where Nami decides to step in could be alluding to her history with pirates. Also it‚Äôs a really nice character scene for Nami. Jango tells them to move their asses before Kuro kills them, and so they all start moving as fast as they can. It‚Äôs interesting because I assumed Kuro was a schemer, but the way the crew acted I guess he‚Äôs a fighter as well. Then we get the big entrance, just as it looks like the Furries are about to corrupt the village, Luffy and Zoro finally get their shit together. I really like the comedic slant Oda puts on it, with Luffy getting mad Usopp didn‚Äôt tell him where north is. Also the paneling with the Neko crew being blown back looks really nice. Overall this was a good start to the battle, and it seems that with the full crew having arrived things are about to be kicked into high gear.

***

The chapter starts out with Kuro waiting in vain for his crew to arrive. He says he‚Äôs gonna kill his entire crew if they fuck up his plans, which does go to show that he really only cares about himself. It‚Äôs interesting, so far of the East Blue villains we‚Äôve seen all of them have generally had the running theme of being self centered, without feeling at all similar in design. Usopp is obviously shocked that Luffy and Zoro wiped out the crew. Luffy replies with ‚Äúof course‚Äù probably because he knows you have to be strong to be the pirate king, it‚Äôs a nice touch. The crew begin arguing again, until Jango finally shows why his rank is so high. He‚Äôs able to use his hypnotism to buff the crew, which is actually a really clever use of the hypnotism gimmick. It also makes Jango a lot more of a threat than I thought he was. They go from being pretty much ordinary people to being able to crush fucking walls, so it‚Äôs not a small boost either. Nami and Usopp head out leaving Zoro and Luffy to face the renewed Neko crew.

&amp;nbsp;

Well that‚Äôs what should have happened, but Luffy is Luffy so he ends up falling for the hypnotism again. Not only is this a good gag, it‚Äôs also a good way to get Luffy out of the way for Zoro's fight (which I‚Äôm guessing will come next chapter). We also get to see another rubber move. Gomu Gomu no Gatling is a pretty simple rush attack but the way Oda draws it as many different fists attacking at once is really pleasing to the eyes and also looks cool as hell. I also realized after Usopp's reaction that he had never seen Luffy's powers until now, something I should have figured out a long time ago. But anyways, this little bit of action was really good, and I like that Oda pushes it even further with Luffy running over to year off part of the ship and attacking with it. Jango rehypnotises Luffy into believing he‚Äôs asleep, putting him and pretty much the whole crew out of commission for the time being. Zoro telling Usopp to worry about his own injury first is both nice of him and another show of how much he trusts Luffy. It seems that Zoros fight is approaching, with the two Nyaban Brothers voices being heard from the top of the ship, who are apparently the alpha furries. It also seems that Kuro is approaching the cliff side, probably to kill everyone there, with the exception of Jango. I‚Äôm guessing next we‚Äôll see Zoro battle whoever the Nyaban brothers are, with the aid of Jango. Then Kuro will arrive and see how messed up everything is, with Luffy waking up in time to battle him. This was another good action chapter, I think Jango is the most interesting non Devil Fruit user so far, and Luffy's shenanigans were fun to watch. I‚Äôm also excited to see the two guardians of the ship in action, as well as captain Kuro. Overall a very enjoyable chapter, I‚Äôm excited to see more.

***
So this chapter was interesting to say the least. It starts off with Kaya, who I didn‚Äôt even expect to show up until after the fireworks. Her confusion over Usopp ‚Äúlying‚Äù was pretty sad, and so was her reaction to Meri being half dead. On one hand, it is satisfying to see Kuros bullshit be exposed, but I also feel bad knowing that Usopp was trying to keep anyone from realizing anything had gone wrong. Though now that I think about it, that was pretty much inevitable considering he‚Äôd have to take out Kuro. Also Kaya deciding not to sit on her ass was really admirable, especially considering she‚Äôs sick. I really do appreciate that every character Oda creates never feels useless, they all serve purpose in the story in some way, and it makes his locale feel more lively as a result. Characters like Kaya, Chouchou, and Boodle would have been nobodies in most manga so I appreciate Oda going out of his way to give them a purpose.

&amp;nbsp; 

We cut to the kids, who are talking about why Kuro was out so early. We see Kaya walking up, which probably means the kids are gonna get involved in some way. It‚Äôll be interesting to see Usopp's reaction to them showing up, whether he‚Äôll be happy or sad. We finally cut back to Zoro, who‚Äôs now facing off against two opponents, the Nyaban brothers. First of all I wanted to mention that Zoro has yet to have a fair matchup, he fought Cabaji while injured and is now doing a 2 vs 1. The Nyaban brothers Sham and Buchi, are very clearly Oda messing around with designs. And I love it. Even though I was joking about it before, these guys do look like genuine furries, but at least furries look slightly more professional. Still I have to appreciate the smaller details, like Shams eyes being slanted, and the cat bell around Buchis neck. It‚Äôs just really fun stuff, and I‚Äôm a big fan of the designs Oda is doing for these goons. I‚Äôll be honest when these guys started trying to pussy out I totally bought it, the whole coward act was pretty funny. At the same time though I really like this fight because it feels like an improvement of Cabajis. Sham and Buchi are bullshiters like Cabaji, but Oda gets more creative with the bullshitting in question. Also much like Cabaji, the Nyaban brothers really go all in with the ‚Äúcat‚Äù theme, Shams first real move is literally catburgling. It‚Äôs really entertaining, and as usual the paneling is very well done. This chapter was once again, really good. I feel like Syrup Village as an arc has generally upped the quality, and I already liked Orange Town. Zoro losing two of his katanas is gonna be rough for him, and I‚Äôm excited to see what other cat related moves the Nyaban brothers come out with. If there‚Äôs a hair ball attack I might actually cough up a lung. Overall,  very good chapter.

***

So this chapter starts right where we left off, with a standoff between Sham and Zoro. It seems like the theme of treasure has almost carried over here, as Sham discarding Zoro's Katanas and calling them trash leads to him going for the killing blow. Zoro slashes through Sham, but if we‚Äôve learned anything from Buggy it‚Äôs that if someone looks like they got cut in half, they‚Äôre actually alive and perfectly fine. Also Zoro's slashing panels look really nice. But at this point it‚Äôs just stating the obvious that Oda is a good artist. At first I thought Sham had eaten a Devil Fruit but nope, he just has a very thin waist. Once again, it‚Äôs so stupid that‚Äôs it‚Äôs kind of hilarious, and I can‚Äôt help but love it. Sham tries to hold Zoro in place while Buchi finally gets off his ass and does something, but Zoro is able to dodge in time. Buchi being able to crack the ground makes me think that Jango will definitely hypnotize him and make him crazy fucking strong (although the ending of the chapter is suggesting something different). Still though, it does go to show that the pirates Luffy's crew are fighting are definitely above average in the strength department.

&amp;nbsp;

Zoro realizes that Buchi is no joke, and that a direct hit will definitely do some damage. This little intermission panel is nice, and I think this fight is really a step up from the last one Zoro had. Although I think the highs of Zoros fight against Cabaji were higher (when he cut himself purposely) the actual choreography and abilities of Sham and Buchi make the fight far more even, and allow Zoro to actually struggle without cutting himself. The brothers use cat attack, which is pretty self explanatory, an attack that‚Äôs basically just a cat scratching. Like I said last chapter, I‚Äôm really enjoying these cat themed moves. Usopp decides to help Zoro out with his slingshot, which is pretty nice of him and once again shows that he‚Äôs not a complete coward. But then Zoro does a Zoro thing, and deliberately moves in front of the bullet to block it with his body. While it isn‚Äôt the same ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù level moment as with Cabaji, it‚Äôs definitely another big character moment for Zoro. He doesn‚Äôt want Usopp to get hurt, and at the same time I feel part of it might be his insistence on winning every fight without help. It‚Äôs another really good moment for Zoro, and I appreciate that every member of Luffys crew is getting some shine. Speaking of, Nami decides to help Zoro our by grabbing his katanas, but Jango once again surprises me by not being useless. He cuts Nami with these weird circular blades, but just as I thought Nami was about to get a solo fight, Captain Kuro finally arrives. What an entrance, after three chapters and Mitch buildup, Kuro finally shows up and boy is his entrance something. He scares Jango, Buchi, and Sham shitless as well as his entire crew. This is the same Buchi and Sham that were going toe to toe with Zoro! This guy shows up with every crewmate injures or incapacitated, and exudes this sinister aura. The kind of aura that says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to fucking kill all of you,‚Äù which he probably will. It‚Äôs a really great entrance scene, which is something that I think is very important when establishing characters, especially intimidating ones. Also shoutout to Oda keeping the crack in the ground consistent, that was a nice little detail. So this was my next batch, the fight has kicked off with a bang. I‚Äôve enjoyed it a lot so far, and I think things are only going to get more heated from here.",11,1585117639,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/foligs/one_piece_journey_chapters_2932_neko_pirates_vs/,OnePiece,1

Hitetsu one of the greatest swordsmith and his masterpiece is only a O Wazamono.  same with  Shimotsuki Kozaburo who's greatest masterpiece was Enma and Wado both O Wazamono....

this led me believe that the only way to achieve/obtain Saijo grade blade is through blackening and cannot be forged by a smith. so far in history their has only been 12 blades that has achieve blackening and become Saijo grade. because their has only been 12 person in history that has the skill and power to go that far....both user of known Saijo grade blade have the title of the strongest.

fojzmm,delicateenergy,Zoro and Luffy Pre-Ts. Zoro and Luffy Post-TS Dressrosa,"I know lots of people say Zoro and Luffy weren't equal Pre-Ts or Post-ts Dressrosa. I am here to give you facts written by Oda himself. I know people dislike Vivre Cards even though they are accurate.(All information that was inaccurate were primarily due to a bias the translator had/fan translation) Thus, this is why I recommend this fanbase learn some Japanese or have someone reliable with no bias translate. People like to say Zoro is Sanji tier, lol. This is laughable. The same people who say this, refuse to acknowledge Whiskey Peak because they say, ""It is a joke"". Zoro and Sanji's portrayal/rivalry has always been a joke. If you say that Sanji and Zoro are same tier, you have to acknowledge Whiskey Peak as serious. Even if you don't, people like to bring up Enies Lobby, I am laughing at this. I will come back to this later and destroy it. 

First, lets talk about how Zoro is always compared to Luffy. No one else in the crew is recognized as a potential captain of the strawhats other than Zoro. His recognition is never due to his personality but always to his feats(Throughout the Story). He is the only one of the Strawhats besides Luffy to be a supernova(Saboady). Both Luffy and Zoro or genuinely curious as to who is stronger, (Whiskey Peak Dialogue). 

Secondly, people bring up Enies Lobby and Doriki as evidence. Did they forget that Zoro also fought both Kaku and Jabra who's doriki combined is higher than Lucci's. People say Luffy left Zoro behind with G2 and G3, laughable. After Enies Lobby, Oda came out with ""One Piece: Grand Element"" a databook he authored himself and said that Zoro is equal to Luffy in fighting prowess/skill/power. This is after Luffy already defeated Lucci. Oda himself acknowledged that Pre-ts Zoro and Luffy were equals. 

Zoro has been nerfed all of pre-ts, not to mention that fresh wound Mihawk gave him that would take 2 YEARS to heal.(Chapter 94 I believe). Plus he took his own pain, plus Luffy's, plus that wound from a Yonko Tier character(Thrillerbark). That alone is good enough to say that atleast Zoro's endurance can be put above Luffy's. Though Luffy has him beat in the poison category. Both Luffy and Injured Zoro remained fighting during the war, Injured Zoro fought questionable Humandrills, Boosted Luffy fought marine fodder and evaded higher tiers. Also in Saobody, despite being heavily injured, he kept up with Luffy.

Now coming out of the TS. It is reasonable to say that Luffy and Zoro were equals based on them leaving pre-ts as equals. We got comparisons of Zoro and Luffy again, with Zoro going after the main antagonist of FMI and Dressrosa. We also saw Zoro fodderized a drugged up and bloodlusted Hyouzou who can be in the range of Drugged Hody due to him being faster than Hody in water. Zoro also went after Doffy but ended up clashing well with someone even stronger than Doffy.

People say G4 leaves Zoro behind, well Zoro still has Asura and has only used ONE flashback, a flashback that was at the beginning of the TS. You see???... G4 luffy couldve destroyed Doffy as we've seen, thus, Zoro and Luffy being equal at this point it is good to say that so could Zoro. Once again for those who haven't read the manga thoroughly, ZORO AND FUJI DID NOT TRY TO CUT THE BIRDCAGE AT ANY POINT. THEY BOTH CHOSE TO BELIEVE IN LUFFY. Also Luffy gained nothing notable fighting wise throughout this fight. Everything he used was already learnt.

Luffy vs Cracker without Nami. Luffy wasn't 100 when he fought cracker, he was already hungry. If he fought cracker without nami, Luffy's natural luck would've kicked in. He would've stumbled upon Cracker's weakness or Food for tankman. You can't deny it, Luffy's luck is a part of him. It even kicked in on saobody, in the form of Kuma. Ace's death was on Ace tbh. Luffy's luck had already worked.

Now when Luffy fought Katakuri, he definitely got stronger than Zoro. This is further backed by the Vivre Card after WCI that said that Zoro was ""just"" second to Luffy in the Strawhat crew.

Now that we're in Wano,  we see that difference beginning to close somewhat as they are the only two in the alliance who get comparison montages for their powerups.

**For the people who LOVE feats. What I also don't get is, people are saying Law has credibility to hurt Kaido. Other than story wise for him wanting to face-off Kaido, what has Law done to say he can stand up there with Luffy???? His abilities have been avoided by a non-yonko character. Nothing shows that he can stand up there, he can be seen as incapable ever since the dressrosa incident. Also, people who argue gamma knife was the reason for Luffy's win. We know doffy is a beast when it comes to his devilfruit. There is no way he isn't portrayed as skilled enough to have Gamma Knife not affect him majorly. Did you guys forget he is still alive and well, this is proof that his string ability was good enough for it not to really affect him. Also, for arguments that say ""Luffy couldn't move"". Oda himself said in an Sbs that Luffy could run away after the first round of G4, thus anyone ready to use that as an argument needs to read that Sbs. Not to mention part of Luffy's character is innate Luck.**",35,1585109846,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fojzmm/zoro_and_luffy_prets_zoro_and_luffy_postts/,OnePiece,1

For me:
Pre-time skip
Franky is a million times better, I think he is my least favorite straw-hat post time skip.

Chopper - I miss his more interesting fights using all of his transformations. Plus he went backwards as a character.

Zoro - he went from a fun personailty to a rage monster. He feels out of place with the crew now and out of place in the series.
 
Robin - next to Franky has anyone been hurt more by the timeskip. She's only higher than Franky because she is non-existant

Hard to decide
Nami - she has been pretty consistent across the board. I think Ennis Lobby was her evolution from helpless in battle to a powerful fighter.

Sanji - I liked whole cake island for his story, but miss Mr. Prince and his incredible clutch stealth moments.

Luffy - always the best

Post time skip
Brooke - he went from my least favorite strawhat to top 4. He looks at an emperor and says ""lets go"". Enough said.

God Usopp - I like his evolution with a littlle more bravado and courage. Not too much, but some. I also enjoy the evolution of his attacks.

fohijj,EstradiolWarrior,Distance from Water 7 to Fish-Man Island,"Now, we know that [Fishman Island is 10,000 meters below sea level](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Fish-Man_Island) (approximately 6.2 miles), which is one of the very few concrete examples of distance or time we get in the series. Normally, we wouldn't be able to tell anything from this, but during the post-Enies Lobby arc, when Kokoro points out Nami's log pose has reset, Nami notices that its pointing slightly downwards.

Now, if there's one thing I learned in my 4 years of engineering college, it's how to solve a triangle, so that's what we do here: Assuming that the smallest noticeable downward angle the log pose could have is one degree, and that the height of the right triangle is 10 kilometers, we can take the tangent of 1 degree equal to the depth of fish man island divided by the distance from water 7 to fish man island, giving us tan(1)=10km/x. 

Solving for X gives us a distance of **\~573 kilometers, or 356 miles, from water 7 to fish man island**.

But of course, we're in quarantine! So we're not stopping there. I looked up historical voyages that would have been similar in length for reference. What I found is that [Nassau to Havana](https://www.distancecalculator.net/from-havana-to-nassau), a common voyage for [historical pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy_in_the_Caribbean), is almost exactly the same length. This trip took a wildly different amount of time depending on the kind of ship, but we know that the [Thousand Sunny](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Thousand_Sunny) is a [Carrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrack) type ship. The top speed of a carrack is about 8 knots, but on average, they would cross about [80 miles a day](https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~vaucher/History/Ships_Discovery/#carrack). Assuming average conditions, and that the horizontal distance between the Sabaody Archipelago and Fish Man Island is negligible, then **the trip from Water 7 to the Sabaody Archipelago would take about 4 and a half days**. Of course, the Straw Hats were held up by Thriller Bark, but that's beside the point.

fodwb7,mcanon89,Nami's Devil Fruit,"I have recently come across a theory (JoyBoys review of Ch 975) that says Big Mom has to die. I would like to build on that. When Big Mom does die, her fruit would be recirculated back into the nearest appropriate vessel. Said vessel, if she dies, may very well be among the hordes of fruit at Onigashima. Said vessel will consumed by Nami.

I don't have much to go off of here, but I would like to point out that 3 out the four times Big Mom's power has been aligned with the Strawhats, they were through Nami's hand. 

The first instance of this was Big Mom's vivre card. Who used it to control Big Mom's homies? Nami.

Who tricked Zues into zapping Big Mom by stuffing him full of thunder balls? Nami.

Speaking of whom, the thunderhead is currently palling around with the Strawhats, but where does he stay? In Nami's Clima Tact. In fact, Zeus is serving as Nami's powerup. 

This is foreshadowing. We are already shown that Nami can invoke fear, if only for comedic effect. Let's not forget, Luffy is a ""5th Emperor"". Even if you don't place on that level, you would not want to mess with anyone who sails in a crew like that. That name recognition alone may pre dispose people to be weary of her. It has also been shown that while Zeus is dangerous on his own, Nami has been able to make more, if not just as much, use of him than Big Mom did. This will be the main use of the Soru Soru No Mii that we will see from Nami. She may even craft a fire homie of her own, who knows. 


Currently, the Strawhats are on their way to Onigashima (and Big Mom herself) with Zeus in tow. I do believe that during this battle, Zeus will defect back to Big Mom, and will dissipate when Big Mom dies. 

Either during the battle or the aftermath, Nami will be eat the newly formed devil fruit and craft a Zeus of her own. One that will be loyal to her, and only her.

That's my theory in a nutshell. If you want to hear/read of another theory I have (the second D of the strawhats), please let me know.",4,1585086293,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fodwb7/namis_devil_fruit/,OnePiece,1

Impel down = Prison arc/mission save ace
Wano = Udon(act 2) /mission save luffy

Marineford= War arc/mission: rescue our brother
Onigashima = War arc/ mission: avenge or captain/father

focuvx,DocWeisz,Corona-chan made me start with One Piece - First impression (Manga till chapter 69),"Since there is a nationwide quarantine (I'm from Germany) I decided yesterday to finally start with the monumental task of reading all of One Piece. I wanted to try it a few years back and started watching the anime, but the dragged out fight scene with Michael Jackson gave me the impression that this would be a chore like running an ultra-marathon barefoot through the Sahara and I was not ready for this. I thought back at the times I endured similar hardships with Dragonball Z, but I realized that my kindergarden self had apparently the patience of a god and I no longer possess such fantastic abilities. The fight scenes of 90s shonen are in reality  fight scenes with myself that I cannot win.  But now with the quarantine I wanted to try it again but this time with the manga, since I figured that the pacing will be a lot more tolerable.

I started yesterday and I read the first 69 chapters. Many people said that One Piece really picks up at chapters 100+, but I gotta say that I really enjoyed it from the beginning and it's a breeze to read (which is rare for me). 

Luffy is a fun protagonist and has this simple-minded, happy, curious attitude that I prefer much more than the edgier types. Reminds me of Gon in Hunter x Hunter. For me it's one of the biggest appeals to see him start with only a small boat and progressively build up his pirate crew. 

The world seems creative and feels alive. The restaurant in the sea for example makes you think that the world is inhabited with all kinds of different, colorful microcosms. It feels vast through the tons of implications that make you want to explore it together with the characters. The overpowered swordsman Van Helsing (that's what he looks like) who sank a huge fleet by himself, gives you a glimpse of what is yet to come and crashes the naive bubble where our main characters were the overpowered ones.

The background stories of the characters are actually really good (like of Sanji) and give them depth. The characters in general are quirky and have tons of personality.

I hope as the manga gets more mature over time (I heard that this is the case) that there will be less overexplaining (less written like a children's book). Even with the manga the fight scenes can drag on too much for example with the addition of forgettable villains like the guy with a big plate as a body in the Baratie Arc . And this was mostly it with the negatives.

In conclusion I really enjoyed the first 69 chapters. The thought that there are more than 900 chapters to go feels both daunting and exciting. I look forward to the journey and his progress in becoming the pirate king and to see what the world of One Piece has in store.

Maybe I write the next impression at chapter 420. Stay safe and healthy people!",0,1585082884,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/focuvx/coronachan_made_me_start_with_one_piece_first/,OnePiece,1

foc0ij,Kirosh,/r/OnePiece No-Chapter Week Event - Discussion &amp; Drawing Thread #03 - Alabasta Saga,"Hello everyone!

As you know, we currently have a break meaning there isn't a chapter this week, so it's time for a new Drawing and Discussion thread!

This time the theme is : 

#The Alabasta Saga


##Meaning we are now talking about chapter 101 to 217 of the series, with things such as what was your favorite arc of the saga, villain, characters of this Saga? Did you like/dislike the arc/Saga?  Are there any characters you want to see again (Dorry/Broggy or others)? What were you surprised about when you reread/rewatched it? Is there anything you want to know more about that hasn't been explained yet? Did you want Vivi to stay as a Straw Hat? Did you expect Robin to become part of the crew? 

So really, it can be anything, from serious and dramatic, to silly and wholesome. So feel free to talk about this saga, and even request drawing related to it or it's characters (example : Vivi with Crocodile's devil fruit).

People who have eaten a Devil Fruit are ""hated"" by the sea, and cannot swim. The ""sea"" here can refer to anything from rivers, pools and baths to any kind of standing water. On a worldwide level, they are all the ""sea."" When these people enter the water, not only can they not use their powers, they have trouble moving their bodies at all. They might be able to struggle a bit, but it wouldn't do much good. That's if their entire bodies are submerged in the ""sea."" With less than half the body or just the limbs, it gets easier.  ""

my thery was about roger not having a devil fruit because he was shown relaxing in a bath pool with friends, the theory is solidated with robin's talk with shinobo when they were in bath :

foa6yd,Jdiggy0424,Zoro in Wano War Arc,"So just caught up with the manga and i had a question regarding Zoro and the sword(s) Enma and Wado Ichimonji:

In the manga it is said that the two swords were created by the same Wano Blacksmith Kozaburo. The 3rd sword that Oden had (Ame no Habakiri) was also created by the Blacksmith too, so as of now we know that there are 3 swords currently that have been created by the same guy.

During the entire Oden flashback we only saw him ever wield two swords and use ""Oden style"". If Zoro has 2 of the 3 swords created by the same Blacksmith, even though Zoro has never used said style, is it possible that he could do ""Oden Style"" in the future due to the nature of the swords? Or is a more practical Oden thing? (which makes sense because of its name featured in the style).",4,1585074305,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/foa6yd/zoro_in_wano_war_arc/,OnePiece,1

Evidence from Oda:

1) big mom rushes to kaido because she knew luffy doesn‚Äôt stand a chance fighting kaido
2) she changed her heart after learning the truth from pudding and katakuri , which is also why those 2 did not show up in the current arc because they are exhausted changing big mom‚Äôs view on strawhats.
3) she won‚Äôt let sanji die as he is the only one who can make heavenly cakes
4) big mom fought luffy in udon prison because she lost her memory
5) big mom started the alliance with kaido just to get his guard down.
6) no point to have big mom fighting luffy again as luffy has finished her ‚Äúarc‚Äù already

fo7td2,PotatoPotluck,Just a thought...,"Does anyone think that Oda might do a reincarnation kinda thing with Oden? The only reason why I‚Äôm asking is because the thought just occurred to me that Zoro was naturally talented with the Two Sword style, much like Oden. Roger‚Äôs execution was 20 years before the present, but Oden‚Äôs execution was 1 year after, so 19 years before the beginning of the story, the same age Zoro was pre time skip, 19. Much like Oden, Zoro displays incredible strength despite his youth, but also shares a bad sense of direction/navigation. What‚Äôs more, Oden‚Äôs ‚ÄòOden Two Sword style‚Äô was a variation of the two sword style that he created himself. Zoro did the same and created the ‚ÄòThree Sword Style‚Äô. I know the ‚Äòsunacchi‚Äô phrase was a dialect used by the Kuri region of Wano, which Oden was the daimyo of. And that Zoro‚Äôs village has various connections to Wano, including the dialect. But I just thought that the time stamp of Zoro‚Äôs age and Oden‚Äôs execution matched up. As well as Zoro‚Äôs original talent of using the Two Sword style, similar of Oden‚Äôs Oden Two Sword style, eventually creating their own variation but starting off with the Two Sword style. It just seems like one hell of a coincidence. Maybe Oden couldn‚Äôt navigate his way towards the afterlife and ended up reincarnating as Zoro, who knows. 

There‚Äôs a very slight chance that Oda might actually do that, but the only reason I came up with this thought was because I ran out of things to do in quarantine and decided to rewatch all of One Piece for some insane reason.",1,1585066642,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fo7td2/just_a_thought/,OnePiece,1

fo6hpb,SeglaJordenRunt,An emperor analysis,"Okay so I've seen a lot of post about the Yonko. What makes them emperors? Is Luffy an emperor? Can there be five Yonko? Who where the previous emperors? Who will be the next four?

So i thought i would give you my take on it. I will try to exclude any personal opinions to the best of my abilities. There won't be any powerscaling.


So first of, what is an emperor?


 Well, an emperor someone who is really strong and really influential. That's really all there is to it. Currently, we have four pirates that stand out in this category. And therefore, four emperors. Hence the name, Yonko.

One thing to keep in mind is that there is no official Yonko title, just like how there is no official king of the pirates. Being as strong as a Yonko doesn't guarantee  Yonko status, and finding Laughtale doesn't guarantee that people will call you the pirate king. It's all about how the world chooses to see you.


Who where the previous Yonko?


 It depends on what you mean. Who where the four strongest and most influential pirates before the current ones? That's a pretty straightforward question with a simple answer (even though we don't have it currently). But if you are asking who actually held the title of emperor, things get more complicated. 

The four strongest pirates aren't automatically emperors. If there is five pirates that excel in strength and dominance, then there would likely be five emperors. If there is three, three etc. Maybe nobody really stood out? If the steps between all of the pirates/pirate crews were roughly equal, it's likely that there would be no emperor status at all. 

So what we need to do is split the question into two pieces. Who where the strongest pirates before the era of the Yonko? Did they stand out enough from the rest to get a special status?

These questions are a not easier to discuss and get decent answers from.


The last question i want to talk about is, who will be the Yonko after the defeat of the current four?


Efter that previous analysis, this question is a simple one to answer. It depends. We know that there will be a top 4, but will they stand out enough from the rest to get a special status? Maybe a top 5 will? Or top 8? If that's the case then that's probably how many emperors we'll have. 

This question i would like to split aswell. Who will be the strongest pirates after the defeat of the Yonko? Will there still be a small group of pirates that stand out from the rest and that gets this special status?

Will Luffy be an emperor? Maybe, it's actually pretty likely that he would get some special status because he seems to stand out amongst the non Yonko captains currently. But will there be exactly three more alongside him? Less likely.


So, this may not have answered the question people have about the Yonko, but hopefully you'll now know which ones you should ask to get a somewhat interesting discussion.

That's all folks, have a nice Tuesday. Oh, and if you have anything to add or if you think i got anything wrong, please share it.",11,1585061979,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fo6hpb/an_emperor_analysis/,OnePiece,1

fo29ie,Masterduck321,My thoughts on Zoro vs Kaido. (Has spoilers from the manga so if you aren't caught up to the latest chapter and don't want to be spoiled then don't read this).,"I don‚Äôt understand how people can think that Zoro can deal massive amounts of damage or even kill Kaido. So, what I‚Äôm going to say are my thoughts on what we have seen so far. So, no head canon or random stuff like ‚ÄúZoro can 1v1 Kaido‚Äù as I‚Äôve seen some people say while being 100% serious. Also I haven‚Äôt browsed Reddit much so if someone has already talked about this topic in the same way I have then that‚Äôs fine.

Zoro, he‚Äôs nowhere near Oden‚Äôs level. Even when he does fight Kaido with Luffy and everyone else and has Enma mastered I still can‚Äôt see him being stronger than Oden. When they do fight, he won't be stronger than Oden at that point and he'll be fighting and even stronger Kaido than the one Oden previously battled in his flashback. I also believe Zoro has much less speed, power and durability than the G4 Luffy that got speed blitzed and one shotted by Kaido. Also, even when Zoro has Enma it doesn‚Äôt automatically mean he will be able to scar Kaido. When people say ‚ÄúEnma is the only sword to cut Kaido which means Zoro will cut him as well‚Äù is pretty stupid I think, because not only was Kaido scarred by Ame no Habakiri (Oden‚Äôs other sword) it was mainly because of Oden‚Äôs insane amount of strength and control over the two blades and his haki that he was able to inflict massive damage on Kaido. I do believe that he might be able to damage him with the swords, but this will be after he gets other power ups from fighting people in Wano. The people I think he will fight before getting to Kaido will be Orochi, other members of the Flying Six we have not seen as we have only seen two of them being X-Drake and Page 1, and either King, Queen or possibly Smoothie. Even after fighting people like them and getting stronger the damage he will inflict on Kaido will still be less damage than what Oden did to the younger Kaido, since Kaido is stronger since then and Zoro is weaker than Oden right now.

Please give me your thoughts and opinions on Zoro vs Kaido. If you believe Zoro can kill or massively damage Kadio please also give me your reasons and opinions on how and why.

Kuma says ""I am an officer of the revolutionary army, that's why I intend to let the straw hats escape"". 

The fact he still considered himself an officer of the revolutionary army makes me think that his obedience to the world government and even his transformation into a human weapon for them may be part of a bigger plan for the revolutionary army.

I think maybe vegapunk has a way to bring him back to consciousness. Otherwise it would make no sense for someone in the revolutionary army to forfeit his freedom simply to work for the people he aims to destroy. At first i thought he might've defected/betrayed the revolutionary army but this is obviously not the case.",13,1585040666,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fo1yja/could_kuma_retrieve_his_consciousness_in_the/,OnePiece,1

And there is more to the purpose of Noah.

* Roger laughs when he reads Joyboy's tale. Luffy laughed when heard Koby's story of how he got on Alvida's ship. When they meet again in chapter 433 he laughs again remembering it. 

* The Sea Kings might be able to sense him. They knew when the two sovereigns had been born and the other was in a distant sea. Koby has passed through the Calm Belt. And he is going to the Calm Belt again to arrest Boa Hancock. Something interesting might happen since I don't think he will be successful.

They could be taken out similarly to how the original rocks pirates were taken down, The Marines teaming up with a Pirate like Luffy or maybe Shanks. Imagine if the newly formed rocks pirates were defeated, the worst generation and others would try to become a yonko, and Luffy would surely be a Yonko. Not only that but Shanks could die leaving Luffy as the only yonko because right now some might not consider him one but after this war he would be.
  The world would be thrown into chaos and the new generation of pirates would go crazy, the Navy would be heavily weakened, still healing and lost a great amount of power and have to attempt to manage this chaos.

fnz31h,Masterduck321,My thoughts on Sanji vs Zoro (Has Spoilers for those who are not currently caught up to the manga),"**Sanji vs Zoro**

What i'm gonna say is my thoughts on what we have seen so far. So, no head canon or random stuff like saying stuff Zoro or Sanji can do when they can't etc. I‚Äôm Not gonna tell you who I think will win but what I will tell you is the information I currently remember and have for Sanji and Zoro. 

**Sanji**

&gt;Sanji is faster than Zoro in base and even more so in Raid Suit but loses in the strength department.

&gt;Raid Suit gives Sanji more speed, strength and durability. It also has stealth and a shield for his cape. 

&gt;Sanji has better observation haki and we have yet to see Sanji use armament haki.

&gt;Sanji‚Äôs strongest kick so far is his ‚ÄúCrosse Strike‚Äù which he used against Big Mom to save Reiju

&gt;Sanji has had a fight with stronger people than Zoro has so far. Vergo, Page 1, and a clash against Doflamingo. With his fight against Vergo he cracked his leg and if they continued fighting, he would‚Äôve ended up breaking his leg. And against Page 1 he overwhelmed him with his speed and stealth, but he did almost no visible damage. He has had other fights, but these are his strongest opponents so far.

**Zoro**

&gt;Zoro in base form is stronger and has more stamina and durability than Sanji though only if Sanji doesn‚Äôt use the Raid Suit. 

&gt;Zoro now has Enma which powers up the amount of haki he can release and the overall control of haki throughout his body. 

&gt;Zoro has better armament haki and decent but worse observation haki than Sanji.

&gt;Zoro‚Äôs strongest sword technique so far is his ‚ÄúThree Sword Style Secret Technique: The Billion-fold World Trichiliocosm‚Äù which was used against Pica. And in stampede (Non-Canon).

&gt;Zoro has had a fight with Pica and Killer as his strongest fights so far. He has also had a clash against Admiral Fujitora and Kyoshiro. He washed Pica easily in the fight though he did use his strongest currently known attack in the fight.  Also, he fought Killer while Killer was in a weak state and they still ended up having a draw. Although they both didn‚Äôt have all their main weapons and Zoro was also fighting Gyukimaru at the start, the fight still ended with them both one shotting each other. This was pretty surprising considering the amount of damage Zoro can usually take. He has had other fights, but these are his strongest fights, clashes so far.

So overall, Sanji has fought stronger people than Zoro so far since the time skip. Sanji is faster in both base and Raid Suit. With the Raid Suit his durability, and stamina get close to the level of Zoro‚Äôs own durability and Stamina. His strength also gets a boost but as of now I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs of the same level as Zoro‚Äôs since his main focus is strength while Sanji‚Äôs is speed. Sanji has better observation haki though Zoro‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seem to be that far off from his. While Zoro has better armament haki, we haven‚Äôt actually seen Sanji use armament haki yet. I think that If we base this off how Zoro is stronger but Sanji is faster than Zoro should have stronger armament haki when we do see Sanji use it. 

They both have a wide verity of techniques and skills they can use during the fight. They both also have a temporary transformable state that they can use. These are Sanji with his ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Memories‚Äù and Zoro with his ‚ÄúNine Sword Style: Asura‚Äù. Sanji used this against Wadatsumi in fishman island where he ignites his whole body on fire and his kicks can light his target on fire when he kicks them. Zoro used Asura against Kaku of CP9 in the pre time skip and against a Pacifista PX-4 during the Sabaody Archipelage Arc.

From what we have seen of these temporary transformable states is that they can only use one powered up attack and then the form ends. Maybe later these will be actual forms that they can keep active for long periods of time just like Luffy‚Äôs Gear Second.

This is all I have to say on the matter of the **Sanji vs Zoro** topic. Leave your thoughts in the comments below. Also don‚Äôt say or make up stuff that we haven‚Äôt seen like Zoro or Sanji isn‚Äôt at full power yet or something stupid like Zoro‚Äôs eye can open. This Post is about what we **HAVE** seen not that we haven‚Äôt or will see later. And don‚Äôt be saying stupid stuff like ‚ÄúZoro fanboy‚Äù or ‚ÄúSanji fanboy‚Äù I like both characters equally as of right now in the story.

This amazing pirate we've been constantly shown flash backs off and been led to believe who is dead has actually been deceiving us. Why hasn't Shanks strived to find the One Piece and become the Pirate King (unless the original PK, ROGER is still alive). It would make sense with how Shanks was able to end the war at Marineford. I mean the Marine had Garp/Sengoku who would've been enough to take down Shanks. We've seen Garp's feats in 957, no way Shanks got out of there alive with AOKIJI/AKAINU/KIZARU/GARP/SENGOKU.

fny9ku,Onianexiaz,The pacing of Wano has made me realise one thing,"Oda will never be able to show every hype moment he has built up. Don't get me wrong I love Wano as it is but the pacing and Odas determination to end One Piece before he can't anymore means that we are gonna skip a lot of anticipated moments we will never get to Shikis full plan, The old Admirals, the story of Ryuma and also the Shimotsuki clan or even a full flashback of Whitebeard likely even God Valley will be shortened. 


Elbaf in itself could have been a full blown ragnarok with Luffy leading the fire giants and Loki against Odin and Thor but I think Oda will shorten it.


I wanna see these moments but at the same time I wanna see the endings and the best solution in my mind is if Oda allows others to have more access to his materials. The Ace and Law novels as well as Z and Stampede are good starts but even then there is a confusion if they're canon or not. 


I think Oda should outright say that the novels are canon and the characters of Z and Bullet are also canon. Maybe even say that Z did die to Kizaru and Bullet did fight all the Shichibukai just Luffy and the supernovas were not there. 

This will build existing characters like the Shichibukai and Admirals as answer questions and give character development that frankly Oda won't have the time for. 

Also more novels on Whitebeard Ryuma Mihawk /Shanks would really help. 

But what do you all think what will be the best way for Oda to cover all bases.",7,1585021376,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fny9ku/the_pacing_of_wano_has_made_me_realise_one_thing/,OnePiece,1

fnwhdw,Herbb__,One Piece Character Evolution,"First time One Piece watcher here, and I just wanted to comment on something that I feel is so good in One Piece compared to the other anime i‚Äôve seen.

It‚Äôs truly the only anime I‚Äôve watched with characters that aren‚Äôt just one time beat by the MC and then discarded, they grow as well. I‚Äôve just finished Alabasta, and it‚Äôs awesome to me to watch not only the Straw Hats grow, but even less relevant characters like Smoker keep retuning, and people like Alvida (from the first episode!) returning with a new devil fruit powers makes things so interesting! It‚Äôs also funny to me to see side characters settle into their lives after getting their asses whopped by Luffy (see: Jango randomly being a marine). It‚Äôs also cool that they show OP characters early who are on a whole different level from Luffy because I know he‚Äôll eventually get there (like Ace and Shanks).

It really does make the world seem more real, and always makes me excited when an old enemy/friend comes back!

Wado Ichimonji will actually be the blade to scar Kaido. Its arguably the most important Zoro sword + he is using it for the longest time.... Haki....

7. Apoo - Strong potential firepower from devil fruit, no feats
8. Hawkins - Amazing defense from DF, tarot cards and decent offense

-this lead to Zou's punishment of walking for eternity, maybe the minks where banned as well

-And since my big bro loves the real world and its history so much

Many of us have been wondering about what the third race was for a long time now - I myself always brushed off Oars and Oars Jr. as giants, but yesterday I realized that they are too different to be just regular giants. Afterall, the Elbaf giants look like humans, but larger. The Oars line looks more like demons (Oni).

Oars and Oars Jr. are obviously of a different race - other redditors already pointed out their similarity to both Kaido and the Numbers, with Kaido being a possible hybrid between human and that race.

- Between act 3 &amp; 4 Blackbeard will raid Wholecake island to steal the poneglyph, and on his way they will kill Katakuri and kidnap Pudding to help him decipher the stones

- Sanji will ultimately face off with Big Mom, while Zoro will face off with Kaido

- Dr. Vegapunk will be introduced in Act 4 and will end up explaining the mechanistic of the devil fruits

Devil fruits:
- It will turn out that Gol D. Roger had planned for his devil fruit (likely wind devil fruit) to pass on to Monkey D. Dragon: the spirit of the devil fruit goes into the nearest fruit. Dragon, who as a former marine was close to the execution site with eg apples (perhaps even given by Roger) eats the fruit and inherits Roger's power. With his public execution Roger advertises his cause and passes on his power to someone worthy.

- Dragon's / Roger's devil fruit is the missing ancient weapon.

- The is no real reason why seawater should draw the power from devil fruit users. We have just accepted that as dogma. It's equally likely that devil fruit users just cannot maintain their powers submerged in the _body_ of another devil fruit user. There should in my opinion be a water water fruit or sea sea fruit, still in use by some ancient being.

fnpf73,Rumbar_29,Quarantine Project - SMILE: an unofficial ONE PIECE documentary,"Hello r/OnePiece! 

I am Nick Philomeno, a filmmaker who absolutely loves One Piece. Much like most other people in the world currently, I've been social distancing and staying home for the past few days. Mainly because I've been bored, I started working on a script for a One Piece project where I'll document the series' impact on fans, Japan, the world, and Oda.  

A few days into rereading the story, experiencing the many emotions some moments brought again, and writing the script, a very important question came to mind:

""What does One Piece mean to me?""

The series' impact on me and my life, essentially.  After sitting on the question for a bit, I realized I shouldn't be asking this just to myself, but the the rest of the community too. So I've come here, to r/OnePiece, to ask for you guys' help in making this project a reality by  answering this question:

What does One Piece mean to you?

You can answer that question in any form you want (comment, video, post, etc). 

Extra note: The project will have small dubbed scenes from the manga (a few seconds long each), so I'm looking for people interested in voicing them! Here a list: 

Gol D. Roger, Luffy, Zoro, Robin, Whitebeard, Oden, Hiluluk

fnp3u7,Crazyghost511,All my bets for the upcoming Wano War *MIGHT CONTAIN TONS OF SPOILERS*,"Hello nakamas, just a random inactive user coming here with some big (or not so big) speculations about the title. They will be made in green text style so they will not be so boring of reading. Take easy on the comments:  


\&gt; next chapter X-Drake will reveal to be a double agent to the navy, if we follow the logic of the two most recent chapter, 974 and 975, every traitor has been revealed on them. We can also expect to see some known faces such as Coby and smoker  


\&gt;Coby will unwillingly tell to Boa Hancock about Luffy and Wano and then she will set sail immedaitely, revealing that both cares about him  


&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Caribou will be surprisingly useful in this war, as we can't forget all that cover story of his (specially the part where the revlutionaries started to follow him and he later devoured an entire weapon factory ,chapter 722, so we can almost assume thet these revolutionaires will arm themselves and help in the battle.  


\&gt; Luffy will fight Big Mom rather than Kaidou, because he picked her up for a fight during the Fishmen Island and we're yet to see him actually fighting her rather than simply running away&gt; Jimbe will use his tlak no jutsu to convince Katakuri, Purin and (why not?) even Brulee to let him and Germa go and they will join the alliance in the war, but only that, Jimbe will convince Neptune and his army to fight as well, and, thinking even higher, the 50 k of fishmen that sought to kill Luffy for his bounty will also join them, totalizing a total of over 60 k of reinforcement for the alliance  


\&gt; The numbers are homies made by Big Mom requested by Kaidou and they 're the favor that Kaidou owes her. They can also be the reason of Kaidou's immortality  


\&gt; As weevil fights the Navy, it's likely that he might be captured, despite his enormous strenght, or at least be delayed enough so that Marco changes of mind and also go for the war  


\&gt; Buggy, while escaping the navy will fall in Onigashima  


\&gt; Kanjurou learns that the ones who killed his parents were not anyone affiliated to the Kouzuki, but the Kurozumi, then, he will eventually turn his back to Orochi and genuinely help the alliance, but at the end of the arc he will be banned from Wano and having nowhere else to go, he joins the mugiawaras, pretty much like Robin did. Besides, the crew needs another member with spying and drawing skill  


\&gt;something will happen to Momonosuke and his body will match his current age (28), likely that Bonney will be related to this  


\&gt; Moriah wil also be there, he would be the Crocodile of Wano  


\&gt;the alliance will be much bigger and will be separated in two parts  
Zoro, Law, Kid, the samurai. Caribou with the revolutionaries, X-Drake, etc.... will fight Kaidou. Luffy Sanji and the fishmen will fight Big Mom  


\&gt; Kaidou can only be killed for real if Big Mom falls first, because of the numbers (7 theories above this one)  
\&gt;Momonosuke will defeat Orochi but will not kill him, Orochi will comit seppuku offsreen and Black Beard will get the Hebi Hebi Yamata no Oorochi Model  
\&gt; The allies of the SH will appear, at least in part

fnodt1,_Yonko-Shanks_,The death of a strawhat,"Its an ongoing debate that luffy's recklessness will end up resulting in the death of one of his crew mates. 

He was reckless and got captured by both bigmom and kaido. Hell, even ceaser caught him. There has been plenty of times he's been scolded by zoro for bot being serious, i also think that luffy need a reality check. He is in the new world, fighting yonko. This isn't anything like the first half, loose your Concentration and you are dead. Just like he faced reality at saboady. 

If it comes to pass and one had died. I think it'd be jimbei. Like the rest of the strawhats he carries his dreams on his shoulders. He wishes to one day bring the fishman to the surface and live peacefully with humans. Why i think it's him is because only his dream can be carried by someone else, just like he carries otohime's. Even if he dies luffy can and will fulfill it. Unlike the rest of the crew members dreams.

Some might say usopp needs to die, because he's a coward. But i don't see that happening, atleast not until he reaches elbaf. I know luffy has gotten stronger since. Turns out there's always someone stronger until you become the best.

fno98f,ecass305,Inspiration for Zunesha,"I think Zunesha is partly inspired by Behemoth from the bible.

It's speculated that elephants are one of the animals Behemoth might be based on. If true it might provide hints to some of the mysteries surrounding Zunesha. 

1. At end times Behemoth and Leviathan are supposed to clash with God slaying both during the fight. That might be Zunesha's crime, he fought with the Sea Kings which inadvertently broke JoyBoy's promise.

2. Behemoth is lives in an invisible desert east of the Garden of Eden. First half of the Grand Line is Paradise and east of that is the East Blue. So maybe Zunesha's destination is hidden island in the East Blue.

fnnvyc,TTVBlueGlass,Speculation: Zoro is the 3rd hero samurai of Wano,"Ryuma used 1 katana, Oden used 2, Now Zoro is coming in with 3.

First, I don't think he will take the Heaven and Hell swords (Emma and the other) permanently, they should go back to Hiyori and Momo as they were their dad's sword. IMO it will be used to finish the job Oden started by helping kill Kaido and then put back into the hands of the rightful heirs, symbolically ending Kaido's reign and the Koizuki clan winning in the end. Originally Momo said he felt he was not strong enough to bear the burden of his father's blade and I am sure Hiyori feels the same about the other one. Momo will eventually feel ready to take up the mantle and lead Wano, and take Enma, while studying swordsmanship under the Scabbards.

During the fight with Kaido, Wado Ichimonji will become the 3rd blade to ever cut Kaido, as it is of the same grade as Enma and Heaven, by participating in a 3 sword cut.

Secondly he currently possesses Sandai Kitetsu, the 3rd class sword of the Kitetsu line. I believe somehow he will upgrade the Sandai, with Tengu giving him the Nidai Kitetsu.

Finally, after he willingly gives back the swords and starts looking for another one to be his #3, Zoro will be gifted back Shusui by Momo, from the capacity of being Shogun of Wano, because he will somehow be convinced that Ryuma did indeed give the sword to Zoro himself, and he earned it fair and square, plus deserves it for his aid in freeing Wano.",11,1584984362,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fnnvyc/speculation_zoro_is_the_3rd_hero_samurai_of_wano/,OnePiece,1

fnndzq,Tony_Wood,Theory Kuina's death explained and the Identity of Shimotsuki ... from Shimotsuki village,"I think Shimotsuki Kozaburo is definetily going to appear at some point in the story and clear up a lot of questions. This theory came to my mind because of several ideas that made sense and even though some were disproven some elements make sense.

First of all my conclusion is:  SHIMOTSUKI KOZABURO = SCOPPER GABAN = RYOKUGYU

I believe that just like his son Denjiro. Kozaburo should be very tricky with his Identity

The questions that can be answered if this holds up are:

.Why does young Denjiro look like Koushiro?

.Why does Tashigi look like Kuina?

.Where is Kozaburo and what happened to him?

Firstly we know that Kozaburo is a swordsmith who crafted the Enma and the Wado Ichimonji and, as his name implies he was part of the Shimotsuki family just like Yasuie. We also know that 50 years ago he fled the country. I think its fairly obvious that koushiro is kozaburo's son because he had the Wado Ichimonji and he's 51 years old right now which means when Kozaburo left Wano, Koushiro was 1 year old. Also, Denjiro should be about the same age which means that he's possibly his twin brother and it's important to note that Denjiro is an orphan so it should make sense.

Ok. So, they are all Shimotsuki. But this isn't too relevant because Denjiro took his own path by following Oden, and bloodlines in One Piece don't define who you are but the WG does care about bloodlines and this is where it gets CRAZY.

I think its important to put focus on Kozaburo's personal story and why he wanted to leave. We know that the Wano citizens weren't allowed to leave so it should be clear that he wanted freedom, but after they finally had left, imagine that there is actually a Goverment that oversees the whole world.            So the escapees got to the most peaceful sea which is the East Blue and we can see them in Shimotsuki Village and Logtown but Kozaburo probably wasn't satisfied with this.

The main point of this theory is that some time after that(maybe 5-10 years) he found Roger who didn't care when the WG tried to stop him and so he left his wife and kid and he also left anything that connects him to Wano(swords and name) which are like shackles that threathen his freedom. And so he got the name Scopper Gaban. 

When he met Oden I'd say he acted dumb but I understand its questionable. And from here it's defenitely a snowball but I still want to continue this.

After Roger's death he couldn't have been executed because, just like Rayleigh he can protect himself and on top of that he might have changed his identity again so, I think he regreted leaving Denjiro and made his mind to come back to Wano. I also believe that Tashigi is Denjiro's daughter and when Oden came back we didn't know what he was doing and so, making a family is a possibility.

I think that when he assessed the situation he believed that this was denjiro's business so he shouldn't interfere though I don't think he was that selfish so there might be more to that. But basically he decided to take his grandaughter Tashigi with him and on top of that he might have taken Zoro to Shimotsuki village and even though his connection with Ushimaru is still unclear it can make sense beacause 50 years ago he was 25-30 years old if he is on Rayleigh's age range so a lot could have happened.

After that with his new Identity Ryokugyu, (a big hint to this is the fact that Ushimaru appeared to have bulls on his coat) he throws his pride away and brings his sword skills back with a Samuraish name. Also he plots something because he already knows about the One Piece and the War after 800 years ( in 20 years) that Oden mentioned and so infiltrates the WG similar to what Denjiro did. He probably introduced a lot of the sword culture (since he's a swordsmith) that we see in the marines, for example Shiryu's sword.

Then somehow they found out about Kozaburo's family in Shimotsuki village and he couldn't do anything or didn't see it coming but basically she was the continuation of Scopper's lineage and they assassinated her.

In the present Kozaburo probably still wants to avenge Oden and so I have a prediction.

Orochi wants Dr.Vegapunk, and Tashigi and Smoker were with Dr.Vegapunk, and they are probably going to need to put admirals along with the delivery to put a handle on the situation which would probably be Ryokugyu and also Fujitora because he fits with the theme, his reltionship with Smoker and he could opose Kozaburo after he finds out the truth. Also Tashigi could possibly have nowhere to go.

And since he knows about the prophecy we have a lot to learn from him, or just like Rayleigh he doesn't say a thing but he's probably ploting something to help this prophecy.

It's gonna be weird seeing sanji fight with a raid suit all of a sudden after seeing him kick ass all this while in a suit smoking a cigarette using his own strength. I'm just not a huge fan of sanji depending on something else for power instead of using his own strength. However what I am a huge fan of is seeing sanji giving the raid suit to Franky and having Franky implement the raid suit into his own cyborg system. Sanji said it himself, we already have a freaky transforming pervert on the crew and that's more than enough. 

Tldr; I don't like how sanji's aesthetic has changed with the raid suit and how he depends on something else instead of his own strength and I would like to see Franky use the raid suit instead.",80,1584978460,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fnm4s1/why_i_dont_like_osoba_mask/,OnePiece,1

One of the things i like about One Piece is that actually doesnt follow the typical formula of each new enemy being stronger then the last and usual their are very good reasons they put up less of a fight then the later ones. 

Two examples i can think of would be how Enel and Crocodile both lost due to their weaknesses being exploited especially Enel who's Devil fruit was hard countered by Luffys but still put up good fights while Lucci had no real weakness to exploit so he was harder to beat and Doflamingo experienced an almost fatal attack before facing G4 Luffy.

my money is on the monster trio, their chemistry and teamwork would be top notch. also this is heavily debated but i dont think law is stronger than zoro. rs sanji has also been impressing me so i have doubts of whether law is even stronger than him. i feel law is more op in terms of support.

fnismd,jobriq,Old hint at Kaido‚Äôs DF ability,"Just realized that Kaido‚Äôs ability to fly was hinted at during his introduction.  He jumped from Urouge‚Äôs sky island, but he apparently got to that island by himself and without a ship.  Riding a knock-up stream without a ship seems impossible, doubly so for a devil fruit user who would have to be in the ocean to do so.  Additionally, due to his ‚Äú100 beasts‚Äù epithet, it was widely believed by fans that Kaido had a zoan-type devil fruit, if he had one at all.

Therefore it would seem logical to conclude that Kaido arrived on the sky island by flying (or some other long-distance transportation ability)

Smoothie who didn't really get to strut her stuff as a Sweet commander and was overshadowed by Oven and Pespero.

fneqv2,SkySky0,Now they know that they are coming for them!,"From last chapter one of the beast Pirates men gave an order to report to onigashima about all alliance forces heading to there.
This means only two things I think, since kaido really hates to have his palace as a battlefield he won‚Äôt just set there and he will get mad and go to destroy the fleets... or even if they didn‚Äôt do anything now that big mom and kaido know they are coming things got even worse because ROCKS alliance guard won‚Äôt be down and their plan will be for nothing (remember they planned to attack them unarmed while drunk and in surprise).

So with that in mind, my conclusion is that their plan will be kind of changed ... how you may ask how? I think caribou is finally about to play his role, with his tricky logia ability he could just absorb all alliances forces inside of him and walk through the ground camouflaging as part of it... RPCKs alliance will be like these rats freaked out and escaped we will hunt them after party or something but then they come out  of blue just inside of the palace... that‚Äôs very one piece style. .. remember ceaser, brolly and Luffy coming out  from inside wedding cake?",4,1584941925,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fneqv2/now_they_know_that_they_are_coming_for_them/,OnePiece,1

fnacej,swoozes,Ranking Germa 66,"I'm going to exclude Sanji for the moment as his power is currently in flux However I will argue that he is, before taking raid suits into account, as strong as Ichiji

Now going from Weakest to Strongest

* Yongji - Youngest brother, and quite possibly the weakest of all of Germa. The biggest reason for this is that his portrayal and who he's fought hasn't been particularly impressive. Reiju managed to send him flying even after he blocked her kick and Sanji was easily able to dent his face with no problem at all. Add to that the fact that his greatest feats are blocking one Daifuku slash and beating Yuen
* Judge - Honestly speaking, I would have put Judge at the bottom save for the implications that he managed to fight Snack and wasn't completely bodied by him (Even if the fight was off screen). And that ultimately has more weight to it than anything Yongji has done.
* Niji - Honestly, he's the hardest of the siblings to place, I fully believe he's stronger than Judge and Yongji, but unlike Ichiji and Reiju, he's got no real definitive wins or feats that make me go ""Maybe he should be higher?"" or ""Maybe he should be lower?""
* Reiju\* - While having the least amount of fights of Germa, I'd honestly say she's had some of the best feats out of all of them beyond just sending Yongji flying with a kick he blocked. Her kick was able to force Smoothie to let go of Nami and also make her note that her poison was troublesome. She is also the only member of Germa we've seen manage to take a named Big Mom attack in Heavenly Fire. Now we can't speak for Yongji nor niji as they were both off paneled by Big Mom, but we have a direct comparison with Judge being one shot by Big mom's Thunder bolt.
* Ichiji - Easily the most impressive of the siblings, in terms of attacks. His major punch on Perospero, cutting Katakuri in half (albeit by surprise) and doing massive damage to Oven. It's honestly hard to argue against him being Germa's strongest. The only exception relies on a potential rather than what could be factually quantified
* \* = Reiju(Devil Fruit) - This is entirely situational and depends on what exactly Reiju's devil fruit ends up being. We know that Reiju has a yet to be revealed devil fruit and that whatever said devil fruit is has nothing to do with her Poison abilities. The situational placement relies entirely on if Reiju's devil fruit is one with absolutely no combat capabilities. AKA if she has one of those pure utility Paramecia like Mr 2.

However, Sugar caused her downfall thanks to one of her biggest flaws: her spitefulness. Sugar knew she should have gone to a safer location due to her previous one being found out but she just couldn't resist trying to get revenge on Usopp first which backfired and got her knocked out. Granted, Sugar thought the grape was full of poison and it would kill Usopp once he ate it but she could have turned Usopp into a toy or let Trebol take care of him since Usopp was clearly Donflamingo's enemy.",2,1584920831,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fn9vvo/sugars_downfall/,OnePiece,1
fn9qje,Alejandroah,[spoilers] Pseudo-Theory and open questions about SWORD,"So, I think that SWORD's objctive might be to have a more proactive role on creating a better world. That means not accepting the status QUO and trying to go beyond upgolding the current ""balance"" of the world (Marines, Warlords, Yonko, etc.).

In that sense, I believe one of SWORD's main objectives is actively dealing with the Yonko instead of just accepting their role. Maybe the most tangible way in which they are moving towards that goal is ""Yonko Infiltration"" as a first step towards eventually defeating them. 

Maybe, just like Drake is a SWORD agent in kaido's forces, Aokiji is a SWORD agent in Blackbeard's crew!

We've known since the start that Aokiji joining Black Beard makes no sense from a storytelling point of view. We know there has to be an explanation, since losing and disagreeing with Akainu and the marines' current leadership is not a sensible reason to freaking join BB... 

I would think that maybe someone like Garp convinced him to start working on a more independent ""Rougue"" division of the marines instead of just quitting the institution. A division with its own agenda, where he could make a difference without upholding Akainu's ideals of ""douchebag justice"". (Yes, this means I believe Garp is involved in sword, which would also explain how koby got there).

SWORD isn't necessarily involved in the abolition of the shichibukai, but now their initiative will probably be more important than ever!

So..

Do you think this assesment of Sword makes sense?

Do you think SWORD has already infiltrated the other Yonko Crews? If you do. Is there anyone on Big Mom's side who might reveal him/herself as a hidden marine?

Do you think Sword will infiltrate Shanks crew?

Who else do you think are a part of SWORD? Maybe Fujitora is involved with them and he supported the abolition with confidence because he believes SWORD will accomplish its mission! 

DISCLAIMER: I know this is probably not a breakthrough theory or anything like that. But I wanted to shed some light on the details of how all of this might come together.

fn9oho,GumsGang,"One Piece Journey Chapters 25-28: The Big Reveal, Captain Kuro!","Yes, this is my first time reading One Piece

Alright so how I‚Äôm going to do this is just write thoughts on each chapter before reading the next one instead of doing four in one go. Thanks to everyone who helped give out suggestions, I really appreciate it!

The chapter starts where we left off, Clahador is being a dick about Usopp's bloodline and because he just doesn‚Äôt trust him. I can‚Äôt say I blame the guy, I understand wanting to help your mistress out but he took things 50 steps too far. I feel for Usopp as well, I think most people know how it feels to be insulted on a personal level in that way, and I think it‚Äôs a big character moment when he decides not to use violence. It shows he‚Äôs a good guy at heart, and he puts his friends' interests before his own. This is also the part where you can see that Luffy is growing to like Usopp, judging by the fact that Zoro was having to hold him back. Clahador gets a bit of background, and it makes him more sympathetic. I get that he wants to help out Kaya but he‚Äôs taking it too far and really isn‚Äôt considering the other viewpoint. Hopefully he figures that all out because he doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad guy in the same way as Buggy or Morgan. 

&amp;nbsp;

Zoro deciding not to go after Luffy is another good moment to show he trusts Luffy. Jango looks fucking hilarious, and the fact that he was trying to blend in wearing the most noticeable shit is great too. Really like these goofy nonsensical characters, it lightens the mood and is also really entertaining. Then we get this little moment from Luffy and Usopp, which changed my mind about Usopp not being on the crew. We get the Yassop reveal, and holy crap Oda is good at these. I guess by these I would mean making his world feel connected, Shanks and Buggy, and now Yassop being a part of Shanks crew really makes everything feel like a part of the same world. It‚Äôs also a really good way to generate hype, when you know someone is related to someone else you really like it can get you excited. But yeah, I think Yassops inclusion is gonna be the end goal for Usopp, to see his dad, and to do that he has to join the crew. We get to here that he was a good sniper as well, so that will probably be Usopp's role in the crew. I wonder if there‚Äôs more to Yassop leaving Usopp though, but it might really just be that the Pirates life was calling. Now the whole ‚ÄúClahador is gonna assassinate Kaya‚Äù thong, I‚Äôm just not buying it. I‚Äôve seen this trope a lot where Luffy and Usopp will probably misunderstand what they‚Äôre saying and everything will be fine. I just doubt Clahador is that kind of guy. I will say that it could be interesting if he was though, but I just don‚Äôt think it will be. I‚Äôm guessing Usopp and Luffy will misunderstand what they‚Äôre saying, and end up looking dumb. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôve seen too many mediums where this exact thing happens for it to fool me. Overall this was a good chapter, Yassops reveal was nice, Jango is funny and I‚Äôm interested in his relationship with Clahador, and Usopp had some good character moments. Overall a really well rounded chapter.

***

So I was way off. The chapter wastes no time in saying ‚Äúyes, this guy Clahador is actually a pirate named Kuro,‚Äù which fits the theme quite nicely actually. Usopp represents what‚Äôs good about lying, while Kuro represents how it can be used to deceive people for evil. It‚Äôs also nice to see a villain that isn‚Äôt as straightforward as Buggy and Morgan. Suddenly Jango is a lot less silly, when you realize he‚Äôs basically there to trick everyone into thinking Kaya died by accident. Kuro is a lot less over the top design wise than Buggy and Morgan, which is also probably on purpose. The whole background is a nice set up, and I like the variety of the villains that were getting. Also the fact that Kuro tricked me as well is a testament to his acting. Or I‚Äôm just an idiot. Also the shits on Kuros suit make way more sense now. Kuro repeating the entire plan to Jango would usually be stupid, because why would you need to do that with someone you know, but it‚Äôs been established Jango is kind of a dumbass, so I‚Äôll let it pass. The shadow art of Kuros crew makes them look nice and intimidating, though I expect they‚Äôll be fodder. Much like Nami, it seems Usopp is a lot more logical than Luffy, and I think they play off each other really well. Usopp freaking out and then Luffy standing up and yelling at them was fucking hilarious, and it was a nice lighthearted moment to prepare us for the rest of the chapter. 

&amp;nbsp;

Luffy's ignorance and Usopps reactions are just a brilliant comedic duo. The hypnotism bit was also great, and it‚Äôs a nice way to get Luffy out of the story so Usopp can have his big character moment. I really do feel for Usopp here. He‚Äôs way out of his depth, basically learning that he‚Äôs actually going to get attacked by an entire pirate crew, and Kuro is absolutely right when he says no one will believe him. I mean he‚Äôs basically a kid who just got thrown into a life or death situation, and I think as wacky as Odas drawing style is, it reflects this very well. I also do like that Zoro doesn‚Äôt really care about the situation until the kids mention something big happening at the shore, since he knows Luffy went there. Usopp runs and yells at the village about the pirates, but of course, no one believes him. It‚Äôs really another gut wrenching moment, something Oda is incredibly good at. You feel bad for Usopp, but understand exactly why no one believes him. We finally get to see Kuros' crew, and uh‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs a bunch of furries. Not what I expected but interesting nonetheless, and after Buggy‚Äôs clown crew I shouldn‚Äôt be too surprised. With that being said this chapter was very good, all the pieces are in place for a big battle. Kuros pirates are approaching, and it seems like Luffy's crew will once again be facing them on their own. Very good chapter, excited to see more.

***

Alright first of all: what a fucking ride this chapter was. We start out with Kaya getting new glasses for Kuro, and we see that Usopp was unable to convince the villagers that he was serious. It does mirror the boy who cried wolf story in some ways, but I think it‚Äôs way more emotionally investing because we actually know Usopp is a good guy. We see Luffy telling the kids what happened, also I feel like the fact that he can‚Äôt remember what happened means he‚Äôll probably get hypnotized again. It‚Äôll probably end up being Zoro vs Jango and Luffy vs Kuro, unless Kuros crew has some wild cards. It‚Äôs also funny that the first thing Luffy thinks about is not getting any meat from the butcher. So this is the part of the chapter that really demonstrates why Oda is a really good emotional writer. Usopp goes to Kayas house and tries to warn her, but of course she thinks it‚Äôs a bunch of bullshit Usopp made up because he was mad. It‚Äôs a really hard hitting scene for a lot of reasons. I felt really terrible for Usopp, because as I said before, he‚Äôs just a kid and it‚Äôs obvious from his actions that he‚Äôs basically trying to save his village. Because of all his lies, he‚Äôs basically realized that the entire village is dead, and he can‚Äôt do anything about it. It‚Äôs also hard watching Kaya deal with this, as we already know she‚Äôs sick and from her point of view the only person who was really able to cheer her up was actually an asshole. This is such a well done scene, and I think the drawings portray this desperation beautifully. It‚Äôs a defining moment in this arc, and I just really love it. Also turns out I was right about Usopp taking after his father and becoming a sniper. Also the band on his arm looks like Yassops headband, if that was on purpose it‚Äôs a neat detail. 

&amp;nbsp;

We cut to the end of the day, with Usopp walking back after being shit on by his entire village. Before I even get to the writing, I once again want to praise whoever colored this because the sunset here is fucking gorgeous, and so is the nighttime scene afterwards. But anyways, Usopp basically tells the kids that he was bullshiting. This is another really big character moment for Usopp, even in his complete freak out mode, he‚Äôs still looking out for those kids and making sure they don‚Äôt get hurt. Although he seems to be the weakest and the biggest coward out of the crew members we‚Äôve gotten, Usopp has quickly grown to become my favorite. His decision to not involve his village and fix his own mistake is really fucking admirable, especially because he probably knows he‚Äôs outmanned and outmatched. Luffy decides to step in, and it‚Äôs looking like the main event of this arc is starting to arrive. Overall I loved this chapter, I‚Äôm beginning to understand why so many people love this series, it‚Äôs funny and has good action, but more than that it‚Äôs emotional writing is incredibly well done. 

***

The chapter starts out with Usopp trying to pretend he‚Äôs not shitting himself in fear. Luffy and Zoro basically restate what I said in the last chapter, that Usopp is a brave motherfucker for facing down an entire pirate cre on his own, especially when you consider the fact that he‚Äôs never even messed with real pirates like Luffy, Zoro, or Nami. We get the location for the fight, I think a cliff side is a nice change of pace from the last two battles, which took place in towns. The whole ‚Äúwhat are you good at bit‚Äù was funny, and it does show that Usopp is still scared out of his mind. We cut to Kuro, who‚Äôs finally bringing his 3 year plan into action. This death scene is really well done, and the nighttime lighting is once again gorgeous. I think the crescent moon thing might have to do with the fact that Kuros pirate crew is based on ~~furries~~ cats. Kuro is also a lot more intimidating of an antagonist then Buggy and Morgan, because unlike those two he‚Äôs not an idiot, and he‚Äôs been planning this entire operation for three years. It‚Äôs also interesting that we never actually see how he kills, Oda is probably hiding his weapon until he brings it out against Luffy. 

&amp;nbsp;

We cut to team Fur Affinity, getting ready to launch their attack on the village. I‚Äôm fine with more gimmicky crews, I think they‚Äôre fun and it makes them more interesting. Jango actually looks pretty cool now, but I‚Äôm interested in why he and Kuro have basically nothing to do with cats, when their crew is about cats. We see that Usopp has poured oil all over the cliff side, which is actually pretty smart of him, a nice change from Luffy and Zoro. The sunrise spread is pretty much the signal for the fireworks to start, with all the major players being shown in one page. The Neko pirates arrive, the ship is pretty much the opposite of Buggy‚Äôs, with darker colors being used instead of brighter ones. Once again, the Neko pirates do look generally more intimidating than Buggy‚Äôs crew, even if they‚Äôre all furries. It‚Äôs here that everything starts to go to shit, with Usopp realizing the pirates must have taken the back entrance. Honestly if I were him I would have put two on each end, then have one run over to get the other two when the crew attacks, but given the situation it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd expect Usopp to be super focused. Usopp tells everyone where to go, but of course it doesn‚Äôt work that simply. Usopp and Nami get there alright, but Luffy gets lost because he‚Äôs an idiot, and Zoro ends up getting stuck at the bottom of the cliff. So the battle has just started and Luffy's crew already has the cards stacked against them. I‚Äôm excited to see how this all plays out, and I also respect Usopp for actually fighting instead of hiding. This was a good set up chapter, and it seems like the main event has begun.",16,1584920061,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fn9oho/one_piece_journey_chapters_2528_the_big_reveal/,OnePiece,1

With the two pieces Reported 

1. An assassination attempt
2. A murder

Garp In the first two manga pannels I posted mentions that ""**blood was spilled""** in regards to alabasta but no one died. And then Shirahoshi explicitly mentions **""Vivi""** and earlier in the Arc the Gorosei actively plot against the Nefertari family. And then before meeting with Im about the **""light that should be extinguished""**  he was holding a picture of vivi leading me to believe that the Nefertari family was either one or both of these pieces of news. We also have two more pieces of information that is a bit confusing about Wapol And Black beard

1. Wapol has Information that seems to be relevant.
   1.  [https://images.mangafreak.net/mangas/one\_piece/one\_piece\_956/one\_piece\_956\_8.jpg](https://images.mangafreak.net/mangas/one_piece/one_piece_956/one_piece_956_8.jpg) 
2. Something is available now that Black Beard wants

But lets dissect the first piece of extra information. Wapol specifically has no link with the Schichibukai or Sabo only having a link with the Nefertari family as Vivi was there helping the strawhats in Drum island and we know that Vivi's relationship with the strawhats is a point of contention.

1.  [http://animerulezzz.org/MangaReader/\[AnimeRulezzz.org-Read\_Manga\_Online\]One+Piece+-+Volume+23+-+Chapter+216+-+Vivi%27s+Adventure%20-%20Page%2015.png?aid=26&amp;attl=One+Piece+-+Volume+23+-+Chapter+216+-+Vivi%27s+Adventure&amp;p=15](http://animerulezzz.org/MangaReader/[AnimeRulezzz.org-Read_Manga_Online]One+Piece+-+Volume+23+-+Chapter+216+-+Vivi%27s+Adventure%20-%20Page%2015.png?aid=26&amp;attl=One+Piece+-+Volume+23+-+Chapter+216+-+Vivi%27s+Adventure&amp;p=15) 
2.  [http://animerulezzz.org/MangaReader/\[AnimeRulezzz.org-Read\_Manga\_Online\]One+Piece+-+Volume+23+-+Chapter+216+-+Vivi%27s+Adventure%20-%20Page%2016.png?aid=26&amp;attl=One+Piece+-+Volume+23+-+Chapter+216+-+Vivi%27s+Adventure&amp;p=16](http://animerulezzz.org/MangaReader/[AnimeRulezzz.org-Read_Manga_Online]One+Piece+-+Volume+23+-+Chapter+216+-+Vivi%27s+Adventure%20-%20Page%2016.png?aid=26&amp;attl=One+Piece+-+Volume+23+-+Chapter+216+-+Vivi%27s+Adventure&amp;p=16) 

And from the Manga its explicitly stated that if **Vivi was found out to be a former strawhat she would be a criminal.** And using a little assumption what if wapol spread that information allowing the Gorosei and Im to criminialize the entire Nefertari family as criminals. Either murdering Crocus and attempting to murder Vivi or successfully murdering Vivi and only attempting to Murder Crocus.  

But either way I believe both the Assassination and the Murder have to do with the Nefertiti family because if one of them was attempted to be assassinated but the other wasn't that leaves the question of why save one. **And I am under the impression that Crocus was Killed and Vivi was only attempted, since she was under the protection of Rosewald the Celestial Dragon.** 

But what does that leave for Sabo and Blackbeard? Well the current consensus is that sabo was ""killed"". The page that leads everyone to think that is this one.

1.  [https://images.mangafreak.net/mangas/one\_piece/one\_piece\_956/one\_piece\_956\_9.jpg](https://images.mangafreak.net/mangas/one_piece/one_piece_956/one_piece_956_9.jpg) 

""The specifics of the incident the government failed to cover up... \[Alabasta and Sabo\]""

""Along with the King's decision and the resulting incident \[The Schichibukai\] Spread across the world like wildfire, stunning all of those reading it""

With Ivankov saying its impossible to happen to sabo, but if sabo died that's totally possible, he was rushing a compound with ALL of the admirals. Ivankov knows this even the commanders of the revolutionary say they could die.

 1. [https://images.mangafreak.net/mangas/one\_piece/one\_piece\_908/one\_piece\_908\_9.jpg](https://images.mangafreak.net/mangas/one_piece/one_piece_908/one_piece_908_9.jpg) 

But if we look again at the people crying over sabo they are all enemies of the world government (good people but ""criminals). So what if instead of sabo dying he did something ""unthinkable"" like killing someone or betraying the revolutionaries something so out of character for him or even being captured in the eyes of ""criminals"". But him dying wouldn't have made much sense given Ivankovs reaction. I can't conclusively say what Sabo did but him being murdered is unlikely.

But what is black beard after? The shichcibukai? Kuma? The treasure of Mary Gieose? I can't say the only conclusion I would reliably say is 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Crocus is Dead and Vivi was the victim of attempted murder due to Wapol/And The Gorosei**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Sabo wasn't murdered he either did something unspeakable or was captured \[Based on the reactions of those reading it\]**

fn98py,sorkaem,Missing information about the strawhats,"So I was thinking about Sanji's past and started wondering what information we're still missing for each SH. So I thought why not make a post on reddit about it :) 

**Luffy**

* Between his two flashbacks (the one with Shanks and the one with Ace and Sabo) I think we know a lot about him. Only one question remains, who is his mother ?

**Zoro**

* His flashback was more about his dream than his origins. Wano gave us some information in the background about his village, but really nothing meaningful. I think more is coming in Wano, but I don't think it will be hugely important. I just wonder if he was raised at the dojo or if he had parents...

**Nami** 

* I don't think we miss anything from Nami's past. We don't know her last name, but considering she's an orphan, it's not that surprising.

**Usopp**

* I think we have all the necessary information. We don't know his last name, and if anyone in the crew turns out to be a hidden D, I can see it being Usopp, even though I'd rather not. 

**Sanji** 

* The two flashbacks covered every important detail of Sanji's past. So we're good. 

**Chopper**

* Complete flashback, nothing more needed.

**Robin** 

* Complete flashback. Only missing information (and I don't know if it's important) is how she got her devil fruit. It's surprising that Oda didn't just draw a panel of her finding the fruit and eating it...

**Franky** 

* Complete flashback with a funny new detail in Wano. Other than that, maybe we could find out the identity of his parents, but I don't think we will.

**Brook** 

* Complete flashback, even though we didn't see his childhood. It could be interesting to have new information, especially considering he was a pirate before Roger's era. We don't know his last name either, but I think that's more because he already died than because there's some mystery about him.

**Jinbei** 

* Even though we didn't see his childhood, the fishmen island flashback was clear enough about it. I don't think we need to know anything else. He doesn't have a last name but so do all the fishmen and merfolk we met.",13,1584918386,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fn98py/missing_information_about_the_strawhats/,OnePiece,1

What if Kings enemy isn't one individual?But its actually 2?Without a futher a due i represent to you the opponents of King and the clues that lead me to this.

KING vs ZORO + SANJI!!

Yep, you read correctly!First its not expected and Oda likes those things.

Clues regarding Zoro:
King has a sword, so he is a swordsman
King has flames and he is literally on fire and zoro is quite intrested on cutting fire and always wanted a fire sword.

Clues regarding Sanji:
Well not so much except that we saw King kicking BM's  ship using a similar technique to diable jumble.
Also King is flying not only because of his DF but he has wings(not confirmed that he can fly).So battling against Sanji also makes sense to me.

But what if we combine the reasons behind Zoro and Sanji fighting King?The dude is probably has more than 1B bounty so both fighting King seems more possible and logical.AND IT WOULD BE COOL AS FUCK!

i don't know if anyone thought of this already..if he has give me a link to his theory or his youtube theory.

You either need a giant body or a power to expand yourself (gum-gum devil fruit). Thats why shanks had the gum gum fruit, as he knew that after 10years the fated one will be born in a faraway sea which is east blue. He had the devil fruit and luffy was the kid at that time who had 'i will be the pirate king' dream. So shanks was just fullfilling his role to deliver the devil fruit so that in future luffy could wield joyboy's treasures. The way luffy ate devil fruit is so bizzare. When shanks and co had the devil fruit, it could be that they would store it somewhere in a safe, but luffy found it on counter, without any protection and ate it. Maybe it was shanks who did all this knowing about the requirement to wield joyboy's weapons. All everything related to joyboy is gigantic like noah ship, mermaid princess, that big straw hat, so how could his weapon or treasure be small?

Di Manes in ancient roman religions are underworld deities sometimes thought represent the soul of deceased love ones. The word di is short for deities. 

Heres a quote from apuleius that i thought related strongly to the will of d in one piece. 

says ‚Äúindeed, that the souls of men are demons, and that men become Lares if they are good, Lemures or Larvae if they are bad, and Manes if it is uncertain whether they deserve well or ill... He also states that the blessed are called in Greek Œµ·ΩêŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒºŒøŒΩŒµœÇ [eudaimones], because they are good souls, that is to say, good demons, confirming his opinion that the souls of men are demons.‚Äù

The words larvae in roman religion is a wicked spectre of the dead, that appear terrifying and grotesque much like Higurashi. In fact higurashi is a species of cicada which may also relate to the regular meaning of larvae. They are said to haunt living relatives ... Orochi.


 
Do you think this could at all relate to the will of the D or the wano arc in general?

fn49ab,Use_Your_Illusion3,"So let me get this straight.... (full Wano arc spoilers, stay away if you aren't current and don't want spoilers)","-The Wano arc opens up with an amazing accomplishment by Zoro that is **a callback to an earlier scene in the series between Zoro and Mihawk** (whom Zoro is seeking to surpass to become the greatest swordsmen), **showing how much Zoro has grown since the beginning of the series**

-Zoro forms a bond with Hiyori, a character central to the injustice of this arc's plot.  The daughter of the martyr of this arc's story.  **Zoro's bond with Hiyori is deeper than any bond he's had with any major character of... any story arc so far in this series.  Zoro's connection to the people wronged in this arc runs deeper than his connection to any of the people in peril of any story arc in this series so far.  And after spending so long largely ignored in the last few arcs, Zoro is featured much more prominently here.**

-Zoro, of all people, agrees to give up his most prized sword, Shusui, because **the people of Wano believe a curse has befallen Wano for the removal of his sword.**  In real world time, OVER 10 YEARS AGO, Oda had Zoro cross paths with Ryuma's corpse (the original owner and wielder of Shusui) and because of this Zoro brought back Shusui to Wano and allowed this national treasure to be restored to its rightful resting place.  **We are told that a legend in Wano is that Ryuma slayed a dragon.**

-After this, **Hiyori gives her sword from her father (Oden) to Zoro.  We are told Oden is the only one who has been able to wound Kaido.  And Oden wounded Kaido with the sword (Enma) that Zoro now wields.**  The reader gets a visual cue of Oden's damage done to Kaido with a big, glorious X-mark (just screaming to get slashed up again, I wonder who will slash at that spot again?) on Kaido's body.

-After receiving Enma, **Hitetsu tells Zoro that people unfit to wield it would be rendered a husk attempting to use it and telling Zoro that if he were to master it, the sword could become even stronger from becoming a full black blade.**  Zoro reflects that by the time he has gotten used to the blade, he will be that much stronger.  **The comments here from Zoro and Hitetsu essentially imply that Zoro will have received a power-up by mastering the sword and taking it farther than it's ever gone before** by causing it to become a full black blade.  How far did this sword go before being fully utilized?  It wounded Kaido, said to be the only thing that has wounded Kaido.  So how far will it go once properly mastered by someone carrying the will of revenge on Oden by Oden's daughter, Hiyori?

-Right after the reader is taught that mastering this blade will yield in a power-up for Zoro, we see that Luffy has got a hang on the power-up he has been seeking to damage Kaido.  **So we see these two, Luffy and Zoro, have gone to a higher level (Luffy) or will be soon reaching a higher level (Zoro with mastering Enma) are being primed to work together to defeat Kaido**

-Just a bit earlier before the events of Zoro receiving Enma, Zoro is with Hiyori as they watch Yasui die (in chapter 942), there is a unique placement of dialogue over panels farther setting up Zoro's role in taking down Kaido.  The townspeople watching Yasui's death comment that no one in 20 years has been able to ""take Kaido's head"".  **The dialogue ""take Kaido's head"" is placed in a panel showing only Zoro.  This whole arc is about all the effort that has gone into waiting for this golden moment that would come 20 years after Oden's awful death.**  Again, with Zoro's connection to Hiyori (and the rage he shows at Yasui's death) we have never seen Zoro so intimately close with the people so central to the conflict of a story arc.  Orochi was only able to kill Yasui because of the power and safety net Kaido kills him.  As Oden learned in his flashback, to get rid of Orochi, you must defeat Kaido.  To avenge Oden and Yasui and take out Orochi, Kaido needs to be taken out

-And, multiple times throughout this story, Sanji has mocked Zoro for having a lower bounty than him.  There are exceptions to this (like misunderstandings) but generally, bounties are set by noteworthy achievements

-I do not understand how after all of this--all of this narrative trail pointing towards Zoro fulfilling prophecy/destiny and leveling up and doing what Oden started with Enma but taking it farther and finishing the job--why there is so much pushback and denial from so much of the One Piece fandom on what is clearly narrative set up for Zoro to play a crucial role in the defeat of Kaido.  

-So often, **if a reader just simply sees the writing on the wall and looks at what Oda has been building up towards and is just honest about the buildup for Zoro here in regards to Kaido's defeat, they are incessantly downvoted (remember, the downvote is not a 'disagree' button) and/or just dubbed a Zoro fanboy wanting their fanfiction to make it into the story.**  

- **Why is it such a big issue to so many for Zoro to have such a huge accomplishment like playing a vital role in defeating Kaido?** Roger was barely the King of the Pirates for like just a few months.  **If Luffy wants to clearly hold that throne, especially for a longer time period, there are going to be so many people gunning for him for that crown.  

- It makes sense that for him to have a strong claim to the crown, he needs an accomplished crew that is a cut above the rest.  **Zoro playing a vital role in defeating Kaido is a feat that boosts Zoro towards his endgoal of being the greatest swordsmen out there and having the greatest swordsmen as his right-hand man is a beautiful boost for Luffy's desire to have the title king of pirates**

-I understand disagreeing, but **how can any reasonable person read/watch Wano and deny that Oda is clearly growing a narrative here of Zoro being vital in defeating Kaido?**  I'm not saying Zoro is gonna 1-on-1 Kaido, but look at all of this stuff in the story.  **People aren't pulling this out of thin air**.  Zoro has barely been touched outside of some so-so fights since the timeskip.  Yet in this arc, he has been getting so much build-up for the final conflict and forming a deep bond with the daughter of tragic hero of this arc.  

- **You mean to tell me all of this is just about Zoro having a fight with King and that's it?  You may not like what is being set up here but why do you have to discount the thoughts by people who are paying attention to the narrative in such an immature way?**",135,1584901121,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fn49ab/so_let_me_get_this_straight_full_wano_arc/,OnePiece,1
fn4665,Shadowonthewall6,One Piece Volune 8: Gin and old faces?,"So I've been rereading the manga and had a thought.

At the start of Chapter 67, Gin takes Don Kreig away but tells Sanji that he hopes to see Luffy again on the Grand Line. Obviously, several hundred chapters later, that hasn't happened...yet...

Now, obviously Gin was ages ago in the East Blue, but if there's one thing Oda has shown, it's that he can keep bringing back plotlines and characters featured ages ago back into relevance in a big way. Whilst I honestly doubt it will happen given where we are in the story and Luffy's current big name opponents, it'd still be pretty cool if we ever were to see Gin again, even if it were in a side-stoy of some sort.

Granted, Gin is a small fish in a big sea and last we met, he was poisoned beyond full recovery...but there has been a two year time-skip AND it has been shown repeatedly that people can recover from deathly situations, or prolonge their life as appropriate.

So, what do people think? Is there any chance of seeing Gin again? Anyone have any cool thoughts for what happened to Don Kreig's number two? 

Or, are there any East Blue baddies/characters that people would want to make a comeback, even if it would be almost impossible at this stage? And what do you think they've been doing since their defeat at the hands of the Strawhats?",6,1584900847,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fn4665/one_piece_volune_8_gin_and_old_faces/,OnePiece,1

fn3toa,EmperorSahir,One Piece 975 Reaction,"Chapter 975 Reaction

Denjiro's character is just very fitting in this chapter. Since he has infiltrated Orochi he knew about all information on both sides. So he knew about yasuei's change of plan and the plan that leaked to Orochi. Knowing both sides he thought that Kin'emon leaked false information to the traitor that is why Denjiro saw this as Kin'emon's smart plan. 
But this was only on Denjiro's perspective at first. Then came the best timing for Denjiros reveal since he have just been waiting for the traitor to reveal himself, after the traitor Kanjuro revealed himself , that is the right timing for Denjiro to also reveal himself. 
So when you look at it, Denjiro was playing along with what he thought as Kin'emons smart plan (which includes of luring the traitor out). So knowing who the traitor is Denjiro reveals ""Kin'emons smart plan"" to everyone. Now everybody is thinking what Denjiro had thought but the truth is that Kin'emon had just misunderstood yasuei's message. The 20 year long plan and sacrifice of Yasuei had just been misunderstood by Kin'emon which led them to this day that gives prosperous them hope. Hope to fulfill Odens wish.

And I also like how Denjiro used the story of the mountain god incident to reveal himself to Kin'emon. The connection between the two made this chapter deliver its real intent.

Ussop - Showcased Observation Haki in Dressrossa. Being a sniper this can be game-changing in any battle. Also, using armament Haki on his sniping can be pretty powerful too. 

Robin - Robin's strength will shoot up if she learns to use Armament Haki with her DF power. She will be pretty unstoppable. 

Franky - Since he is a cyborg and not an android, he can use Haki. Also he is very strong physically and hella durable. He can use Armament Haki with his attacks to make himself much more durable making him a terrifying tank. 

Brook - Brook can use Armament Haki and Observation Haki since he is a swordsman like Zoro and can get a significant powerup. 

Chopper - Chopper relies on his wit rather than his strength in battle so he can use Armament Haki with this Kung-Fu point or in Monster form (that seems unlikely considering how taxing it is on Chopper). 

Nami - Nami prefers to be a long-range fighter after timeskip and since she has Zeus, I don't see anything significant with her using Haki.

fmzp2y,G_STAR_4LIFE,How does Doflamingo make his string clones look so.....real?,"I've always found Doffy's ability to make clones a bit bs, but I let it slide because there are more bs things in One Piece so it's kinda minor, but the other day I had what you might call a shower thought. 

Okay I understand that Doflamingo is basically coiling his strings together into a shape that resembles him, I can totally get behind that. The problem lies in the fact that his clones are shaded in colour and appear have real human flesh. 

Mr 3 from Baroque works had a similar ability to create wax clones but in Impel down he stated that without Miss Goldenweeks artistic colouring they're not good at fooling people because they still resemble wax figures.

So how in the hell does Doflamingo give his clones a 'real life' look to them? Prior to Kyros cutting off his clones head, everyone in that room believed the real Doffy was present, which means that clone must have looked realistic as hell, even Violet with her glare glare powers couldnt distinguish him, neither could Luffy, Law and the executives who are all observation haki users.

I'm trying to rationalise this in my head but it doesnt make sense. The only plausible answer to this is that Doflamingo is able to alter how people perceive his clones by somehow aligning his strings in multiple layers that even light itself bounces off them and creates optical illusions. This would work if his string are reflective but even that would be BS. 

It's really jarring what Doflamingo can do with just strings. Please dont downvote me to hell for saying this but Oda went too far with this power, because some stuff is just silly. Shit like stitching his internal organs back together, how can he even see what hes stitching if its happening internally?

Blackbeard tells Gecko Moria what's going on in world and in the scene points that Supernova captains ( Luffy, Law, Kid, Hawkins, and X Drake) are going up against Kaido and chasing party is Big mom.

Apoo is also a Supernova Captain but wasn't mentioned.

fmzapj,Tomtoro24,Watching one piece - a newbie's beginning,"Hi all

Just started one piece and decided to record some of my thoughts as I watch it. Previously myself and my wife have got a kick out of new ppl watching fandoms we like so thought I'd do something in case others like it. I'll probably post every ten episodes or so which might take a few days depending on how busy I am. Let me know if you like it, if you wana talk about the early days of one piece or if you want something else; if you don't like it, I get it no worries, keep scrolling :)

I'm on episode 90 ish at the moment, just met chopper at last and seen him defeat a guy in 3 minutes. Seen chopper a lot and really couldn't wait to see him. Totally surprised to see him kick some ass! Kinda thought he'd me like kon from bleach, the cute animal for comic relief xD love him already, especially his heartbreaking back story which seems to be a staple story mechanic for one piece? Think it's the thing I like most, like a guy turns up and I'm like screw you guy, you suck, then I know his heartbreaking back story and then I'm like I'm so sorry guy, you're cool, don't worry, we're cool right sob sob. 

How on earth are ppl keeping hats on in this manga/anime! If I was an opponent, I'd punch em straight in the hat man, there's no elastic or ribbon there at all..... Altho pretty sure someone took his hat and got punched in the face hole.. So you know... Probably shouldn't. 

Looooving the back story we get in pretty much every character, they seem to be quite heart breaking and I'm loving how fleshed out everyone and everywhere is, it's like everywhere already existed for hundreds of years and then I turned up to hear some old stories. I think that and the humour is what's carrying my interest currently. The humour is wonderful, like luffy trying to eat chopper at first xD

I can see why one piece is so popular but currently I'm having to put conscious effort into carrying on instead of watch another new anime..... OK, watch hunter x hunter or death note for the millionth time xD because I've heard one piece is super awesomely amazing whereas so far I'm finding it amazing, instead of super awesomely amazing... If that makes sense. But I've heard that it's like diesel, slower to gain momentum but doesn't ever stop, just keeps geting better and better. And I'm also wary that I'm watching episodes that are 20 ish years old? So I can't really compare them with anime that is newer than that. It is easier to watch than other anime though, not sure if I've seen filler yet but sometimes 20 episode fights with entire episodes of screaming or talking in between fights can really kill the momentum so onepiece is really easy to watch, it seems like a good rhytym. 

Luffy, the best protagonist I've seen so far. The other characters are actually amazing too, I tend to prefer side characters more than protagonists though. They're usually way better. But luffy is the best main character in any anime/manga so far. His delivery of diagolue and rhythm, how he says things, are so funny. It's hard to explain, you know what I mean, when he's not geting something straight away or when there's food or something, it's just funny, he's really cool. Way better than all other main characters. 

I dunno man, shorts and sandals, that's pretty cold. 

Zoro, badd, ass. Can't wait to see him more. I'm wondering if he does anything else with his swords, like techniques and stuff. His training scenes are epic, like the sword training using heavy weights. Nice. Love it. 

Ive heard that one piece is typical Shonen Jump story telling, which js great, I love Shonen Jump style like death note and hunter x hunter and Hajime no ippo, they're my favourites. But I'm also aware that one piece isn't fight - train - gain power - fight - defeat boss. And I usually love for that formula, so focusing more on individual back story and depth and adventure and new lands is new to me; I'm enjoying it, but kinda miss the more in depths battles and the brains behind them, like how characters fight their opponents in naruto and ippo and hunter x hunter. I know the fights get even more awesome and more Shonen, but I also think that that's not the focus of the show? So that'll be interesting.

So anyone that eats devil fruit can't swim? In a world of pirates? That's gotta be a major issue right? I'm keeping an eye on that, that's gotta be addressed. It's like a world of cake and nobody can pick up a spoon. 

So, so far it's brilliant, it's like I've been watching kids with tonka trucks for years and now someone has shown me people making monster trucks..... One piece is so much more fleshed out and there's way more to it......noniffence meant to tonka truck enthuasts, they're cool, they are, we're cool right tonka truck man, right?

fmz53y,boyplunger56,Theory - Blackbeard link with Drum Island and why he came to Drum island,"1. In chapter 965, there is this particular background scene of a snow country with mushroom where Whitebeard crew was landed and immediately there's where Blackbeard was picked up in the following panel. [http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece/965/5](http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece/965/5)
2. Mushroom + Snow combination kind of island has actually appeared once before
3. When chopper went to retrieve this amiudake mushroom, he has this encyclopedia of mushroom which shows where they are from in the various parts of drum island
4. When luffy and co wants to get to the castle above, the cable car was said to be destroyed. But in some of the flashback, Wapol was sitting on a cable car that was actually shaped in mushroom design
5. In one piece 9th movie, though it is non canon, Oda actually designed Wapol brother as Musshuru. The entire character design is based on mushroom where its the name in japanese, its devil fruit power and the hair design
6. Back in drum island arc, there's also a scene where Luffy was talking with Sanji about a urband legend ""people from snow countries don't sleep"" and Sanji replied that thats because they will die. Clearly, a foreshadow about Blackbeard coming to today
7. Now that we have linked Blackbeard potential connection with Drum Island, this makes speculating blackbeard journey back to Drum island a little more credible
8. Blackbeard for some reason is somewhat linked to a hippopotamus design. Wapol is another particular character with this linkage as well.
9. When Blackbeard came to Drum island, he was said to be in a crew of 5 people, therefore quite possibly, Dr Q has already joined the crew and Blackbeard didn't come back to find a doctor
10. There's one special thing about Drum island ties quite a bit of mystery in One piece and that's Wapol devil fruit, Baku baku no mi. This devil fruit is special in that when wapol consumes 2 bodies, he could actually produce a combined human body with 2 person joined together. 
11. In wano arc, there's this particular smile devil fruit that's very interesting for me, Dobon, the guy that ate Hippo Smile and there's a scene where the hippo that grew out of him, ate him, as though a metaphor of Hippo eating Hippo.
12. You get the hint here? Hippo eating hippo. Wapol eating Blackbeard, forming the weird body of Blackbeard.
13. Blackbeard probably knows the power of Baku baku no mi and therefore journeyed his way back to Drum Island because of his history with Drum Island",3,1584879883,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmz53y/theory_blackbeard_link_with_drum_island_and_why/,OnePiece,1

fmypao,JoueShot,One Piece Live-Action Thoughts,"Hey guys I just wanted to say that One Piece Live-Action is going to be fucking disgusting. Like utterly dogshit. Take the Netflix Death Note and shit 500 times on it then u will see what this Netflix adaptation will be like. They're going to have some newbie actors, who will never be able to pull off the uniqueness of the One Piece world. Like can u imagine taking a guy with a bloody sword in his mouth seriously. One last thing, there is no way any woman on this planet can ever compare to the One Piece girls cos they sexy af and whoever plays Nami would be unlucky cos they're not going to be able to make it. Then we have Luffy. Who tf is going to be able to play Luffy without fucking up? He's such a weird character and if these guys failed to play Goku then there's no way ever they can make a successful Luffy. One Piece isn't even that popular in the West and after the Live-Action I'm guessing it'll be less popular in the West cos people will literally throw up after seeing it.

TL;DR: It will be pure shit, so just get ready to send those 1 star ratings to tell Netflix to fuck off.",9,1584877657,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmypao/one_piece_liveaction_thoughts/,OnePiece,1

Seconsly I know sometimes fan groups like new people to post every now and then and let them know how they are geting on with the series (nostalgia and interest I guess), is this something ppl wouod want from someone watching it for the first time?

fmyhhb,AmokRule,Why is the spread of information in One Piece so inconsistent?,"I find it odd that for convenience, distribution of information disclosure for certain aspect is somewhat questionable. I just realized how most of marines are ignorant to pirates' abilities, and I am talking about some most famed ones, even though it is literally their job to encounter them head on. And it is illogical to assume that the WG and marines just hand out bounties and acknowledge some pirates' existence just based events they caused without actually knowing their capabilities, there are always evidence and witnesses everywhere. It is slightly annoying to me and I feel things like these are essentially dumbed down to make more shocking ability reveal, and I figure that might just be the writing style of Oda. And take Strawhats as example. With some bright crews and the most prestigious historian in the world on board, are sometimes so ignorant about world's events and how they could get away with many dangerous situations with almost zero knowledge on their opponents, even though they are stupidly notorious. The most plot convenient thing I could point out is that no Strawhats were aware of Ace's capture, the biggest news at the time, which occured between Water 7 saga and Thriller Bark, when there is not a single reason in my opinion not to know that in a span of weeks or even months.",12,1584876470,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmyhhb/why_is_the_spread_of_information_in_one_piece_so/,OnePiece,1

fmw2am,parte-boca-dos-300,Little Oars Jr and Numbers connections,"I believe the numbers are part of the same race as Little Oars Jr and Oars (it was stated that Little Oars Jr is a descendant of Oars). Let‚Äôs not forget that the numbers where specifically called numbers ‚Äòfrom‚Äô Onigashima and there‚Äôs also a looming connection between Oars‚Äô (who‚Äôs confirmed to be the same race as Little Oars Jr) epithet (continent puller) and Wano‚Äôs geography but that‚Äôs another theory.

And if we want to go even further that might be the comeback for Little Oars Jr in the story. There‚Äôs no way Inuarashi is coming back empty handed I think he might come with some of the Whitebeard subordinates (Little Oars Jr and Izo for instance). But that‚Äôs just speculation 


Some more bullet points to support theory:

- Oni means demon in Japanese (if I‚Äôm not mistaken) and Oars/Little Oars Jr. resemble Onis.
- When Oars was introduced he was frozen so it‚Äôs possible that Moriah got his corpse from Ringo
- There‚Äôs a big skull in Onigashima that straight up looks like Oars/Little Oars Jr 
- Even the smallest looking number (the one with the round face easily dwarfs the very big Inuarashi and Nekomamushi (assuming it‚Äôs the same number from back then)
- It was shown that Little Oars Jr was given a straw hat by Ace which he learned how to make in Wano so Oda could‚Äôve been implying to a connection back then

Momo will be the future shogun one day. but he still doesn't have the leadership or power rightnow. in with the red scabbard momo want fully grow to his leadership role because of how they treat him like a baby still. in doing the war he will see that for hisself and then will come to the conclusion that he will have to leave with luffy to get stronger for the future of wano 

Momo will ask Hiyori take ova for a while why he goes traning and to see the world hiyori will say yes remembering something her mom once told her in then will convince everyone I that momo need to go being momo taki for Oden when he was out on the sea's 

But before they leave some how otama will find out luffy is Ace Brother and will beg him to go to sea with him. An luffy relationship with Otama I like a roger shanks relationship and luffy relationship with momo is like roger and buggy

fmv5fr,Terthelt,Parts of the series worth watching animated?,"I‚Äôm binge reading the manga for the first time after years of being too intimidated by its length to start (it‚Äôs a good distraction from... world events), and I‚Äôm loving it to bits. I‚Äôm already up to the Little Garden arc, and I‚Äôm eager every day to read more.

I don‚Äôt want to miss out on anything cool from the anime, though. I know it has a lot of problems with pacing, filler, varying animation quality, etc, but I‚Äôve also heard and seen a lot of pretty awesome shit from it over the years, and there are a couple of parts so far that I‚Äôve read and would love to see in motion. I figure I‚Äôll get a lot of good suggestions here.

I‚Äôm particularly interested in cool fights, but I‚Äôm open to anything that‚Äôs enhanced by animation and audio. Just name the thing and give me the number of the episode or episodes it‚Äôs from. I‚Äôm not too worried about spoilers for pre-time skip arcs because I‚Äôve absorbed a lot of spoilery stuff already, but still, spoiler tagging things would be nice, especially if your suggestion is more detailed than ‚ÄúLuffy vs ___‚Äù or something like that.",7,1584857096,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmv5fr/parts_of_the_series_worth_watching_animated/,OnePiece,1

When I got back into anime in college I assumed this series was just another too long shonen and although I was willing to watch Naruto, I just remembered One Piece feeing very slow and having way too many episodes. So I never watched again and I just let YouTube podcasts etc spoil me on major events for years. Oddly this let me know a lot about One Piece. Enough to satisfy me just watching the occasional end of arc fight. However in the last year I recognized the series prestige especially with the hype of recent manga arcs. I just read the Wano arc since I already knew all about Wholecake Island. 

Now since I wanted to fill in some wholes in my knowledge I‚Äôm just watching these short videos which highlight most of what happened in each arc. This will help me get more into it going forward without wasting my time. I don‚Äôt really have time with work to watch or read all of it.

In Oden vs Kaido the difference in their numbers was a major highlight but Oden knew CoC infact his CoC was probably much stronger than Luffy yet we clearly see him having to fight his way through despite black lightning being emitted. 

Also thematically Oda has been really hyping up the importance of not just strength but the numbers of a pirate crew as well Big mom Kaido Whitebeard had huge armies despite having probably  some of the strongest CoC currently. Only Roger and Shanks are outliers but they couldn't or don't intend to achieve the defeat of the World Government. 


If Wano is a prelude for the final war then Oda will likely hammer the importance of an army to the Strawhats by having 1000s of Whitebeard pirates saving the day rather than CoC. 

Tldr I believe CoC is important for an Yonko but soo is an army and Wano war will prove that.",5,1584853066,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmucns/why_coc_wont_work_in_the_raid/,OnePiece,1

fmu3hm,kashebe,Oda and the One Piece anime,"I think I‚Äôm almost 100% under the belief that Oda is telling Toei to make some of these fights longer and put more details into them. One of the biggest reasons for why I say this is because Oda has been keeping a lot of the fights short in the manga. 

For example, Luffy vs Kaido and Soba Mask vs Page One. Both of the fights were kept short in the manga but were stretched out and extremely detailed in the anime. And honestly, I have absolutely nothing wrong with this. Hopefully we can even get something like this for Zoro vs Kamazou and Gyukimaru. 

I feel like this also goes along the lines of Oda actually meaning that he wants to end OP in around 5 years. Or maybe he‚Äôs just really rushing to get to the war. Either way, I really do think that Oda is telling Toei to do these things now.

fmtqvw,bakwan,Spoilers 975 - Tin foil hat time! The Pirate Alliance and the raid.,"I wonder if Kaido and Big Mom's combative and distrustful past experiences together will come back to bite them. Big time. 


Once the shit hits the fan on Onigashima, won't the Beast Pirates immediately suspect the Big Mom pirates of foul play? Kind of like how the entire WCI incident was attributed to 'Luffy's genius' and the whole Tokage port and Hato screwup was later interpreted as being 'Kinemon's brilliant plan', would it be that much of a stretch for the Beast Pirates to immediately jump to the conclusion that this was all an insidious plot orchestrated by Big Mom?


Luffy returned from WCI (relatively) unscathed; Vinsmoke Sanji was supposed to be married to Pudding Charlotte, Big Mom's daughter, (and as far as the Beast Pirates are aware, they still very well could be); Pekom's, the Mink, is (was) on Big Mom's crew and it just so happens a giant army of Minks are in the raid party; and the biggest red flag for me personally, Nami has a thundercloud made up of part of Big Mom's soul!


Who wouldn't be suspicious at that!

I insulted their intelligence, called them horrible names whenever they said that Zoro would low diff Sanji. I am sorry and I hope you can forgive me!  Zoro low diffing Pica should have been the indicator but I was still holding out hope that Oda would deliver as he did pre-skip, but unfortunately, he did not for Sanji's character. I just want to say that the Zoro fans were right and I was wrong! Zoro and Sanji are not on the same level nor are they even in the same tier. Zoro would beat RS Sanji low diff. Whilst I love the character and it will always have a special place in my heart, I see that Sanji is a cook, not a fighter and he is nowhere near as strong as Zoro. Once again, to anyone who I've insulted when you claimed the reality of Zoro and Sanji not being close or in the same tier, I am sorry, I was a fool and I hope that you can forgive me!

fmsjnu,Dreambokek,My fear with CoC.,"I fear Oda will slowly but surely write CoC out. Kinda like how he's been neglecting Law's abilities because they're way too OP. I will not be counting Sengoku not using CoC in MF because that was a retcon so Oda maybe didn't have it in mind at the time, but Oden not using it against Kaido? Yeah that was utter bs. Ashura has seen Oden use this ability, and Oden himself used it against WB, so it makes no sense that he didn't use it against Kaido's goons. 

Before you say ""Well it wasn't shown so we don't know"" we do know because every panel Oden is in, Kaido's goons are either dead or out cold, but they don't have that thing in their mouth whenever someone is knocked out by CoC. I think Oda will just use it when the numbers are too huge like in Fishman Island, but in Wano I'm thinking he won't use it because there's only 40,000 guys and Luffy can easily take out 50k. . .

I hope Luffy uses it, and it works on most of them but not all of them. That way it makes sense and I don't feel like Oda is becoming a trashy writer üò§. I don't think Luffy has knocked out any smiles users, so Oda could use that to his advantage.",20,1584845426,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmsjnu/my_fear_with_coc/,OnePiece,1

fms2up,Yonko30,Gin's Return in Wano - Theory,"I posted the original one on Amino, which you can check out [HERE](http://aminoapps.com/p/1n2dpl)

I'm going to be discussing why I believe Gin will be making a comeback in Wano. Sorry if this is a bit too long, but this is as short as I could make it. Anyways, below are the reasons why I believe Gin will be returning soon.

Gin's Last Words

So in [this picture](https://v93.mangabeast.com/manga/One-Piece-Digital-Colored-Comics/0067-002.png) Gin says that he wants to meet again in the Grand Line. Now this may not sound like that big of a deal but the thing is that Oda wouldn't make Gin say this and then never make them meet ever again. Also, if he was to make Gin die then he would've killed him off in front of us, because by now we should all know that no one is dead in the One Piece world unless they die right before our eyes or if they die in a flashback. Unless your name is Sabo lol. On the other hand, you could argue that he only had a few hours to live, but remember this is One Piece where you can survive anything as long as your plot armour is strong enough.

 
Oda Hasn't Forgotten About Him
 
I've heard quite a few people say that Oda probably forgot about Gin or he doesn't care enough about him to make him come back, but guess what? In 2015, over 15 years after Gin's last appearance, Oda told us Gin's birthday in an¬†SBS¬†in Volume 81.

 
Beasts Pirates
 
One of the reasons why I believe it's very likely for Gin to make a comeback in Wano rather than a future arc is that he seems like a good candidate for the Beasts Pirates. Firstly, there is a theme of card ranks and card games within the Beats Pirates and coincidentally there is a card game called Gin. Also, it is very much possible that Gin ate an artificial Zoan DF to boost his strength and become a part of Kaido's SMILE army. This would also explain how he survived in the New World.

 
His Relation to Wano
 
Gin was actually shown to have quite a few Japanese elements to him. First off, his weapon of choice is a pair of¬†[Tonfas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Tonfas.jpg)¬†tipped with iron balls. Tonfas are mostly associated with the Okinawan marital arts, which originated from the Okinawa Islands in Japan. Also, the¬†[dragon](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/4/49/Gin_Anime_Infobox.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20181010201600)¬†on Gin's jacket¬†has a similar shape to¬†[Kaido](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/a/a8/Kaido%27s_Dragon_Form.png/revision/latest?cb=20191208070737)¬†and¬†[Momonosuke's](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/3/34/Momonosuke_Dragon_Anime_Concept_Art.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20180904170103)¬†dragons. Dragons in the One Piece world are only associated with Wano, which is further proof that Gin could have some sort of relation with Wano.

 
His Role in Wano
 
I think I may be going too deep into this, but I'll say it anyways. So I think that he will most likely fight Sanji, because in East Blue he was slightly stronger than Sanji and it would be cool to see them reunited again and see how strong both of them have become since the last time they met. I think that after his fight with Sanji, he might help out the Straw Hats as a way to repay his debt to Sanji from when he fed him in Baratie. That would be really cool and it would show how Sanji's kindness towards Gin helped the Straw Hats make a strong ally or some shit like that. I'm going to stop now cos I'm just making stuff up at this point lol.",1,1584843515,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fms2up/gins_return_in_wano_theory/,OnePiece,1

fmrreh,downtimeredditor,My Strawhat Tier Rankings,"Got kinda bored. Wanted to try this

**Tier 1: Luffy**

He's Captain of the crew and usually takes on the boss so gotta be Tier 1.

**Sub Tier 1: Jinbe**

I wanted to put Jinbe up there with Luffy but I wanted to give the captain his own tier even though I know Jinbe is about Luffy level too

**Tier 2: Zoro and Sanji**

Both of these guys have always been seen with Luffy as the monster trio in their crew so yeah I think they are tier 2. Despite the training both got I still view Jinbe as ahead of them right now

**Tier 3: Franky, Usopp, and Chopper**

Franky is as Brave as the monster trio but I think his lack of Haki I think puts them in the tier below. 

Usopp and Chopper are part of the scaredy cat trio of Nami, Usopp, and Chopper. But with Choppers control of Monster point I gotta put him here. And I also have to put Usopp here as well as since he unlocked his observation haki. Prior to him unlocking that I'd have him in the tier below this one but him unlocking that haki yeah I'd put him there 

**Tier 4: Nami, Brook, and Robin**

I could have easily switched Robin and Ussopp spot but it's just since Alabasta arc maybe skypiea  she just isn't in too many boss fights. She has the strength to do it all I mean she took out a boat in alabasta arc and took down one of the alabasta soliders. But Oda kinda uses her more for archeology and some espionage. 

Nami has obviously gotten great control over weather but she's isn't too fond of fighting, but she can hold her own via tactics &amp; strategy. I'd honestly place her in the same tier but again I'm giving Usopp that edge due to Haki. 

Although Brook has gotten better using Devil fruit powers and unlocking new powers, combat wise i don't really see large improvement. His moves have largely stayed the same since Thriller Bark.  I am actually tempted to Brook below this tier tbh

In conclusion, I don't mean to put the Ladies last but it's just based on what have seen so far I feel like Robin is very underutilized. I can see the argument that I'm weighing Usopps haki to heavily. Tbh Franky is only a tier below Sanji and Zoro because of Haki. If Franky had some armament Haki I'd put him right up there with Sanji and Zoro. Yeah I'm maybe weighing Haki more than I should but that's just me. 

What do you think and what is your ranking of the straw hats

Tl;Dr: 

Tier 1: Luffy

Sub Tier 1: Jinbe

Tier 2: Sanji and Zoro

Tier 3: Franky, Usopp, and Chopper

Tier 4: Nami, Brook and Robin.

Only changes I would make is bringing Usopp to tier 4 with Nami and Robin but Haki pushes him up and Franky moving up to Tier 2 should he ever get Haki. 

And I feel Robins combat skills are underutilized",32,1584842238,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmrreh/my_strawhat_tier_rankings/,OnePiece,1

fmrdl2,Twenty-Two-Twenty,Unpopular opinion but One Piece is not a master piece! It have lots of errors.,"Don't get me wrong. It's a great manga, I love it but like the rest of the mangas it have its errors and its not a master piece.

Let's start with a recent incident. Eichiro Oda not Gichiro Goda who is a great man which I respect failed to explain something beautifully in the last chapter. I mean he is a human after all. Readers failed to understand it but when people fails they don't like to say it. So these boys acted like they understood it which is something even Oda and his character Kinemon couldn't understand either. So one of the gentleman made a post here explaining how he understood it üòÇ and apparently he is helping others which is hilarious üòÇ because its about something that didn't made any sense. I pointed that out so all the fanboys down voted me  thinking that's how they prove their point ü§î. Called me a Troll because apparently that's how you prove you are right. 

So I wanted to make a different post to explain why eventhough it's a great manga it's not a master piece. Apart from this little incident his excellency Mr  Eichiro Oda made few errors in the manga which makes it not a master piece:

1. A manga based on pirates but 90% of the fights goes on land. At first Oda wanted to do lots of fights in the sea but he failed because he is a human like us. He failed because of the rules of devil fruits. Doesn't want the fights to be where its about one guy trying to sink the other guy because they are both devil fruited hammers.

2. Large pirate crews with fodders and marines with fodders doesn't make sense in the fights. Let's look at marineford. Those fodders on the battle field made no difference.

3. When Oda first brought Logia devil fruit's to the manga he had no idea about haki and later he decided about haki and brought it so it could be possible to fight logias. At first Oda wanted to give each Logia df user a weakness like water to Crocodile but than Oda found out he cannot do it for all the logias so he came up with the concept of haki.

4. Haki again. Color of armament or something like that. When Oda introduced it he didn't introduced it a way to show the readers whether they are using it or not. So after the time skip he decided to shade it.

5. Size difference of characters. This is another downside of this great manga. The size difference of characters isn't drawn accurately. There are huge mistakes in this area.

6. Power ups of pre ts and after ts Luffy and some others. So a Pacifista can take all of Straw Hats pre ts but after the time skip Luffy can one shot it. So the people of Luffy's strength pre ts should be one shotted by post ts Luffy who could get one shotted by Kaido. This power gap of pre ts and post ts makes no sense. So pre ts Lucci is fodders fodder but somehow even Admirals praised him.

7. Taking that long for Akainu and Aokiji to finish that fight. Same with Ace and Jimbei. When Oda made this 10 to 15 days fights he thought about the endurance and closeness of the opponents are why those fights were so long. So will he be able to show such a fight that takes days in future. I don't think so. So Oda should have made the fight shorter. Could have said they are so fast that they are doing all those in few seconds.

8. Time. Yes time. Oda is not good with it. The way time flows during the chapters. He cannot handle it very well. How many days it take for Luffy to travel from A to B. How long it takes in each island. Apparently it takes some days in most of the islands but when it show its was like a day or two in each island.

9. Gear 4th. How Luffy can float in the air and how there can be air coming out of his legs/shorts. Yeah doesn't make sense.

10. Slow ass white beard in marineford. Kizaru could have fodderised him with his speed of light.

11. Kizaru could travel the OP world in mili seconds and find raftel and one piece but Oda's excuse to this is he is lazy.



Conclusion: Don't get me wrong, it's a great manga that I enjoy to read and discuss but not a master piece. Not at all. Also bring in with negative karmas because you boys cannot refute those arguments.",27,1584840670,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmrdl2/unpopular_opinion_but_one_piece_is_not_a_master/,OnePiece,1

Which got me thinking, if he used the form for a few blows then voluntarily opted out of the form instead of running up to it's time limit and needed to wait for his haki to regenerate, then I think there wouldn't be a wait time at all. If that's true then I think it could open up possibilities for Luffy to use the form in more everyday fighting and make him a more terrifying figure as it has incredible destructive power. Without the downside of the downtime after use and long as he regulates himself I think it makes sense.

fmnp8a,GoldXP,The relationship between Buggy and Shanks is really underrated. (Spoilers),"I love how Buggy doesn't care AT ALL that Shanks is an Emperor. To him he's just Shanks. During the end of the Marineford War Buggy was yelling in his face and putting his hands on him. It easy to see why the fodder pirates thought he was brave. If one where to do that to another Emperor it would be seen as suicide and beyond stupid.

Shanks still cares about Buggy. Like when he saved him from drowning, or when he stayed behind with him while the rest of the Roger pirates when to Laugh Tale. I also like how Shanks has really matured, but Buggy is still pretty much the same as he's always been. It wouldn't surprise me that if Buggy was ever in real trouble Shanks would come to his aid. I can imagine the conversation being something like this.

Buggy: I didn't ask you to come save me you red-haired idiot!! Don't expect me to thank you!!

fmn4qx,King_of_the_Beasts,[Joke] Imagine if Law did *that* special surgery on...,"....*Kaido*?

(I'm referring to the immortality transfer surgery which will kill Law in the process.)

Many of us assume Luffy will be the one to recieve the immortality power. But imagine if *hilariously* and ironically, *Kaido* got the immortality transfer? Now that Kaido is definitely unable to die, he loses all interests in waging a Global War to die/suicide. Maybe he juat walks away from Wano, a defeated Dragon?

So picture this scene: Luffy and his allies have gone all out against Kaido. Gear 5, Awakening etc. You name it, and they've attempted it. But *its still not enough*. But then Law does a IQ9001 move and takes away the one thing Kaido wants most....death.

I don't know what happens next. Maybe Kaido just mentally shuts down from the despair and ""eventually stops thinking"". Or a reformed Big Mom uses this opportunity where Kaido is paralysed by fear to steal his soul/life energy. 

(So Kaidos *body* can't be killed, but without a soul its just an empty shell, kinda like Oars from Thriller Bark).",12,1584826260,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmn4qx/joke_imagine_if_law_did_that_special_surgery_on/,OnePiece,1

fmmv0w,G_STAR_4LIFE,"Law's heart switching ability and teleportation should be two separate powers, or Oda should have never given him that fruit","Remember what Law did to the strawhats back on Punk Hazard? He casually switched their hearts while they were all running the opposite direction from him, and it appeared almost instantaneous. what's more, because it's hax there's no way to avoid it while in his room. When Law made that massive room to cut the meteor he should have used Shambles to instantly switch the hearts of Doflamingo and Fujitora.

Please don't give me bullshit like, ""They would have blocked it with haki"", haki has never blocked anything like that before, or ""Doffy knew his abilities"", yes Doflamingo knew his abilities but he still got hit by them a few times didn't he? How many times did Doflamingo get forcibly teleported by Law? There you go.

Let's be honest guys, Law was nerfed to make for a more interesting plot. On Punk Hazard Law switched the strawhats hearts around and he did it with utmost ease, he didn't even need to look at them (his back was turned and he did it while talking to Smoker). As long as there are multiple people within his room, Law should fuck them up. 

Oda should have never given Law this ability because it's just stupidly broken, that's why he doesn't use it anymore. think about it? In Wano he could have switched a drunk Kaido with some fodder crew member.  It's not even just that heart switching ability: the ability of his to forcibly teleport anything in his room is overpowered in of itself, that itself would normally be just one power, yet Law's fruit has so many ridiculous uses. 

I've found on this sub that people really downplay how overpowered teleportation. Do you know how overpowered it is to move from point A to point B, instantaneously, without actually traversing the distance? If you haven't watched Naruto search up on youtube ""Fourth Hokage vs Tobi"", then you'll see how broken teleportation is.

I'm not a Law fanboy or anything, it's just so frustrating to watch Law's fights because he's supposed to be a really intelligent guy but he doesn't use his powers the right way (it's not that he doesn't, he's just nerfed by plot).",19,1584825552,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmmv0w/laws_heart_switching_ability_and_teleportation/,OnePiece,1

fmmjdw,wanokuni,Strength of the Alliance:,"Currently the alliance has 5400 men. However, if we take into account the amount of people and their apparent strength, then we can calculate a more accurate yet hypothetically inflated number.

Kinenmon has stated that Denjiro was worth approximately 100 men in battle. With Kinenmon being the leader of the scabbards in his day, we can assume his strength is comparable to any of the others during the flashback. I understand that all scabbards aren't created equal, but lets assume they're close enough in power. So, this means that the scabbards are the equivalent of 800 men. 

Now, Doji, Denjiro, Inu, Neko, and Kawamatsu survived through the 20 years. It is said by Inu and Doji in Chapter 950 that they have grown stronger over the 20 years. We can assume Kawamatusu can be left out of that category, as he was in prison and did not have time to train. Let's assume that the 4 have then doubled in strength since the time skip. This would mean each is worth approximately 200 men. Meaning that 4 are worth 200 and 4 are worth 100, making the scabbards alone worth approximately 1200 men. This then ups the fighting power to approximately 6600 men.

Zoro and Sanji were stated by Luffy to be worth approximately 1000 men each. If we apply this rule of power scaling to Luffy, we can assume Luffy is worth 2000 men. THis is obviously a low ball, as he can knock out 50,000 pretty easily. Lets put Kid, Killer, and Law in the middle of this monster trio at approximately 1500 men's worth. The named monster trio and supernovas add approximately 8500 men's strength to the fighting force. If Jimbei shows up we could add another 1500 for approximately 10,000 men's worth. Lets assume the other Strawhats, Law's main crew, and Kid's main crew are each worth \~ 100 men. This would put another 1200 men's strength to the overall mix.

All of this put together, the approximate strength of the alliance is 17,800. This is compared to the 40,000 at the banquet, which approximately 300 will be disposed of after the ships sent out are sunk. 

So, 39,700 to 17,800. With Luffy and Kid's conqueror's Haki, it should be able to get evened out.

I understand BM and Kaido have Haki to deal with the alliance, but you can assume that each samurai has a large will based on the 20 year wait for this moment.  I also understand that most of the main players in the alliance will be fighting named characters from the Yonko party. However, one can assume a lot of fodder will be eliminated in the process. 

TLDR; The alliance has more ""man power"" than seen based on some loose interpretations of numbers and it should be an even fight..",3,1584824671,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmmjdw/strength_of_the_alliance/,OnePiece,1

fmm538,rumpyhumpy,Some problems i want to discuss about in regards to the communtiy,"I was on r/memepiece, where there was a post about a guy saying kny was a better anime than one piece and one piece  had bad world buidling, now first of all he dude in the post is a complete dumbfuck just by saying one piece has bad world building, but then some dude in the reply section just started going out on naruto fans for no apparentr reason and calling kimetsu no yaiba one of the worst shows on the plant and  now i have 2 questions to ask you all because even though i have watched every single ep and read the entire manga, i am just 4 months into the fandom, so still relatively new, here are the questions :

1. Why do you hate naruto so much ?? I just want to know why , i like both shows equally and while there are somethings one piece does absolutely better than naruto, there are some aspects of naruto which i enjoy more than one piece, so i just can't understand why whenever someone talks a little critically about one piece, you guys bring out the dude to be a naruto fan and shit, like why do you hate naruto so much


2. Whenever a manga is compared to one piece, why do all of you immediately start to shit on it about how it does not even compare to one piece ?? I understand that the discussion in debate might be a little one sided, but why shit on the manga just because it is being compared to one piece, i just heard some dude call kny the worst manga of this year, and i don't know what to say, instead of congratulating goutuge about her manga being successful, every single post i have seen discussing that has just shat on KnY to even being conpared to one piece


One piece is a great show, and i absolutely love it, definitely in my top 5, but its community is almost unbearably toxic, i am truly sorry for saying it but my time on r/one piece has not been he best because of the community, so please mind giving me a little explanation, thank you",33,1584823550,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmm538/some_problems_i_want_to_discuss_about_in_regards/,OnePiece,1

fmljmz,goodyfresh,"Sunny definitely has a Klabautermann: We just saw our first evidence for it that is definitely not just a gag (major spoilers for Ch. 975, proceed at your own risk)","Note: TL;DR summary at bottom.

Let me start this off by saying that yes, I know many claim we have already been shown hints of Sunny having a Klabautermann based on how it makes ""facial expressions."" However, the issue with those ""hints"" is that Oda is very fond of sight-gags, so there is literally no way to know if those are meant as serious foreshadowing, or if they are just jokes, especially considering that a figurehead is made of rigid wood and can't actually change its facial expressions. Thus those cases cannot be considered conclusive evidence for a Klabautermann.

However, in Chapter 975, we saw our first piece of evidence for Sunny's Klabautermann that is within canon (Episode of Merry doesn't count) and for which the only rational explanation is indeed a Klabautermann. What I noticed was this: **Nami's tangerine-trees, and presumably the other personal-items on deck belonging to the crew, survived the explosion when Sunny did, as we saw the tangerine-trees in the background in 975.** This of course can't be for the same reason why Sunny itself survived; that explosion was huge and encompassed the entire ship, and Sunny only survived because it is made of Adam Wood; there is no way that ordinary tangerine trees could survive such an explosion.

I've thought about it, and there are only *two possible logical explanations* for Nami's trees surviving the explosion:

1. It is a plot-hole, an oversight by Oda. But such a thing is **very unlikely** as we call Oda ""the Almighty Goda"" for a reason, he is a master of his craft who writes his story extremely consistently and almost never, ever creates plot-holes.

2. The Sunny has a Klabautermann, and said Klabautermann manifested itself (as we know Klabautermanns do so during extreme/dangerous situations) in order to protect its beloved crew's personal-items which were on deck. Note that **the sails were destroyed and had to be fixed,** and this provides further evidence; In order to protect the crew's items which were down on deck, Sunny's spirit had to prioritize that area and allow its own sails to be destroyed. 

Of course this makes a ton of sense, as Sunny is as well-loved a ship with the same awesome crew (but now with even more members) that Merry had, and has been far better physically cared for than Merry was. Nami is its navigator who has saved it from sinking by reading the waves and weather in dangerous situations, so of course Sunny would want to protect her most precious possessions! It also makes sense because **Oda is very, very fond of subtle foreshadowing, so a hint like this is precisely the kind of thing we can expect him to include in the series.**

***TL;DR Summary:*** Unless it is a plot-hole (which Oda never does), Nami's tangerine trees surviving the explosion would have been impossible unless Sunny has a Klabautermann which protected them. This means that Sunny has a Klabautermann who is a sweetheart that let its own sails get destroyed so it could protect its crew's stuff!

fmhsza,Landlord_Lock,"Me: ""God"" Usopp's post Wano/pre Elbalf Power Up? Let me know something? I'm a Usopp fanboy"," Now I'm high on marijuana cigarettes while playing 2k so bear with me.

God -Prophet ‚úî/Savior ‚úî/Leader (in progress...)/Creator (?)

Prophet: lies... (Need I say more?)

Savior: Dressrosa

Leader: I believe Luffy &amp; Zoro will leave him with the chore of commanding the Grand Fleet. (Why even mention Zoro you say? Are you saying Zoro is Vice Captain? SLOW DOWNNNNNNN Zoro fan club!!! I'm just saying ""TWO"" people drank from the FATHER cup in Dressrosa &amp; neither was Luffy....) But he has been known to think on his feet with everyone's abilities in mind and he shouts and carry out plans. Sanji &amp; Nami (and Robin ofcourse)  are probably smarter but what set's Usopp apart is him thinking with everyone's abilities in mind to achieve the goal. Everyone else thought process is just what CAN I DO to save everyone.

This is where it get's funky 

Creator: Yeah he's a bluffer, yeah he's for comic relief, yeah he's a sniper, &amp; yes he can actually live on the land and know plants and shit.    Oh yeah and he just got observation haki... How will we progress past that? He's about to fight a Yonko... This has to be creative. I won't tell my full theroy but this will basically give you what you need;




FS1.....     Usopp still feels useless... Anytime he becomes brave and thinks of a plan he still needs people to achieve his goal. He always needs something. He'll be great and better if could be a little more independent. (He even rides chopper while everyone else runs)

FS2.....      Who DESIGNED the flag?


What if there was a devil fruit ability of some sort that allows the consumer to bring ART to life? I wish ODA would create that... Then it spawned on Wano somehow and Usopp accidentally consumes it in a very funny way.... A devil fruit like that would not only be useful for battle. But Usopp can combine it with Skull King's music and they could potentially create music videos lol j/k. But that would be some nice comic relief because Usopp can draw but he's not the best so it won't be OVERPOWERED but funny in situations when playing jokes or investigating lol.

2. A dragon who ate an Oni fruit?
3. A human who ate a dragon fruit?
4. An Oni who ate a dragon fruit?
5. A human-fishman-hybrid who ate a dragon fruit?

Since Momo's artificial fruit seems to be based on Kaido, I think he isn't a dragon originally. I also don't think he he a human - he shares physical traits with Oni, and has an Oni weapon. What speaks against the Oni theory is that he would be a totally different race, and traditional Japanese  (humanoid) mythical creatures don't exist in OP (Kawamatsu turned out to be a fishman, not a Kappa). A human-fishman-hybrid is likely too, as most horned people turn out to be fishmen in OP, his scale tattoo (and Katakuri's teeth, if he really is the father) support this.

fmetzt,Villa827,Kaido's Final Form!!! (Spoiler),"Considering we're now closing in on the final battle with Kaido... I'm predicting we're going to see something new from him:

We've seen Kaido I'm his human (errrrr.... Oni?) form.

We've seen Kaido in his Dragon (beast) form.

Kaido's devil fruit is a Zoan. And every Zoan user we've seen has no less than 3 forms they morph between- Human (untransformed), Beast (fully transformed), and a HALFWAY TRANSFORMATION- a mixture of their Beast and Human form that is far far stronger than the other two.

So at some point during the battle on Onigashima, (most likely at the climax of the battle) once Kaido realizes hes actually being wounded (by Luffy using Max power Armament Haki), I think we may see Kaido make one final transformation:

His Halfway- full powered form- A DRAGON MAN TRANSFORMATION!


Granted, if he has this as a trump card, you can argue that he didn't use this form against Oden... But perhaps he never took Oden seriously untill he got a serious wound from him!

It's also very possible that Kaido is such an incredible badass that he's ALWAYS resting in his half-way  Dragon man transformation, and is constantly at maximum power.   In that case.... I'd be kinda delighted to see what his human (untransformed) form would be.

I am just concerned for the first time watchers of One piece who use arc list to skip filler arcs will skip those episodes and then be confused when Aokiji comes back after Enies Lobby. Is there a way to report this mistake/ or change it? Those episodes were fire and needs to be watched.

fmd65y,bibek070,"Is it just me or has Wano as an arc made you look at strawhat and MC as ""meh"" [Spoilers upto 974]","No disrespect to any characters or our main roster whatsoever, but after Oden's flashback, the entire series upto this point almost feels like it was about Wano and its journey to attain liberation.

Its my personal opinion; but I dare say

The amount of info we got as we approached Wano and journey of Oden himself up until this point has almost made me feel like

""yeah yeah strawhat luffy and his pirate crew's journey....blah blah blah..whatever...show me more of the old era..show me more of Roger's time. Hell with marineford...show me god valley incident- the full scale of it""...

I don't know if this is just with me, but Oda has really made me indulge heavily with Wano as an arc of One Piece. I have not felt this way since skypiea and jaya arc combined. 

And I hopefully will speculate that the fact we've been thrown a lot of information regarding the series as a whole in Wano would be understatement in itself, as I suspect, there's more coming our way. 

This has been the **first One Piece arc** for me, that constantly put myself hungry for more of story building plots of the series, its history and other old era events on a weekly basis.",8,1584787490,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fmd65y/is_it_just_me_or_has_wano_as_an_arc_made_you_look/,OnePiece,1
fmd59z,merzow,For those still confused on the ending of chapter 975,"The original coded message was intended for habu port but the plan was leaked and yasui gave out the request to add 2 lines to the snake (habu in japanese) to make it a lizard (tokage) and thus changing the location of which port they were meeting up with.

However this wasnt the case. The only one who belived that that was yasui's intention was kinemon and so kin told the allience the meeting place will be at tokage port instead of habu... Hence why only the scabbards and the pirates were at tokage port.

Yasui's ACTUAL intention was to place 2 lines, Symbolising to cut the middle off in the sentance of ""habu minato"" (minato means port so literally, habu port)

HA | bu mi na | TO &lt;-- \[remember, the 2 lines are what kinemon thought were legs\]

So now the message reads hato which means wharf in japanese. But you may be wondering how would we have known what wharf yasui wanted to meet up at? Well the location of habu didnt exactly change, The only thing that did was instead of meeting up at habu's port, We are changing it to habu's wharf. Which all the scabbards should of known that habu port was yasuis favourite maple forest.

Denjiro complimented kinemon on his skill of hiding yasui's real intention by feeding the group with misinfomation by telling them the new location is tokage port. however kinemon just misinterpreted  yasui's message and actually thought that the meeting place was tokage port. So essentialy he screwed up but it worked out in their favour by identifying the traitor.

fmbrqy,daredevil005,People who say Ace died because of his stupidity don't understand his character.,"So I've seen lot of people say that he died because of his stupidity but I think that was his character, his character 'as made evident in the flashback of Luffy, Sabo, Ace' was that if his friend got insulted he would not let it pass no matter the danger and Akainu dissrispected arguably the most important person in his life so he had to stay. Its similar to Sanji saving his family members even tho  they were fucking assholes(except Reiju) or when Zoro took Mihawk's slash head-on and not on his back bcoz 'swordsman pride', we think of these scenes were legendary because both of them survived, but imagine if Sanji/Zoro died people would call them stupid so yes in your perspective Ace arguing with Akainu will look stupid (to me it does too) but that's because most of us don't have the same personality, now I'm not saying that if he didn't argue he would have been out of character but than he would be called intelligent but as the things happened they were just bcoz of his character which got him killed.

fm9ww5,Regulator_Joe,Just Me Venting About My Favorite Character (Spoilers),"I love One Piece that is something teenage me never thought he would say. But I do ever since I came back to the anime around Impel Down and decided to read the entire manga I couldn't get enough. The story the characters the devil fruits the ships I have loved it all. 

However I have been disappointed in one aspect. The treatment of my number 1 and number 7 favorite characters. Smoker and Tashigi respectively. I loved these two from the moment they came on the scene. smoker being the Dirty Harry-esque bad ass Marine who can give Luffy fits and Tashigi the quirky sidekick with a ton of upside I was hooked. It made me love him more when they were dealing with Crocodile. Showing that he knows when he needs help dealing with a bigger problem. Then telling the higher ups to eat shit man that dude is cool. What I like the most though is that he never stops the pursuit of Luffy. He is not all of a sudden buddy buddy with him Luffy is still his target which I find refreshing.

Now comes the timeskip. I was wondering how long we would have to wait and see Smoker and Tashigi and it happens right after FI. I am hype Smoker got a badass new look and I'm ready to see him kick ass. For me the hype was real

Then came Punk Hazard or as I think of it The Castration Vice Admiral Smoker. Am I being overly dramatic probably but man I was depressed that how arc. To see my guy Smoker be consistently humiliated with no chance shine. He went from getting bodied by Law, having his heart stolen, being put into Tashigi's body, having to beg for his life, getting bodied by Vergo, then getting one shot by Doflamingo. You would think Oda hates this character. I mean damn I haven't see a burial that bad since Booker T took on Triple H. Not to mention Tashigi needing an assist from Zoro. I love Oda but I do wish he would learn that other characters can save the day.

I mean seriously wouldn't it been narratively speaking wouldn't have been better if Smoker and Tashigi fought there battles had to overcome and triumphed like hero's do. Wouldn't the image of Smoker handing Law back his heart telling them they are even and walking away giving Law a full view of the Justice kanji on his back. Wouldn't it have been better if Tashigi showing that while she may not be physically as strong as Zoro her skills take a back seat to no one and take out Monet all by herself.

Come on Law still could have had his epic speech and derp-sliced a mountain and Zoro could have been the one to finish off an already beaten Monet. Sending these two off on a strong note (especially with Smoker about to get one shot)

I still have hope that Smoker will truly be the new Garp and show he is a force to be reckoned with and that Tashigi will show there is more to swordsmanship than brute strength but I got to admit it still makes me sad to think about the state of my favorite (and 7th favorite) character

Tl;dr Butt hurt Smoker fan is butt hurt

P.S. Kid is my second favorite character and I hope Oda has him show out",13,1584767735,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fm9ww5/just_me_venting_about_my_favorite_character/,OnePiece,1

Instead the ships ended up serving a completely different purpose. While the 4,200 men left one night earlier with the necessary amount of ships, they left behind all the extra ones Franky had built. These served as decoys, since the Beast pirates destroyed them thinking they had destroyed the invasion force‚Äôs entire means of transportation, when in reality, they had only destroyed extras asked for by Franky. 

Without these extra ships, Kinemon‚Äôs 5000 IQ plan would never have worked, since Orochi would have known something was up if the port had been empty.

fm62p9,ASKMEIFILIKEKPOP,Matchup predictions of the final battle,"Now that the stage is set and we pretty much know all the allies on Luffy's side, what do you predict the matchup to be and why?

I will go from more likely to less likely predictions:

Zoro vs King: King is the 2nd strongest after Big Mom and Kaido. That's who Zoro has always fought since the beginning of OP. Both are swordmen and Zoro has mentioned he wanted to learn how to cut fire and King has a fire ability. King is probably the strongest swordman on the island and it wouldn't make sense for Zoro not to face him if he wants to be the WSS. Yes a lot of people says Zoro is nowhere near yonko commander level but we haven't seen him go all out yet - and I bet Oda chose to do it intentionally to hide his power level and surprise us at once.

Jack vs Inuarashi + Nekomamushi: For revenge of their missing limb.

Kaido vs Luffy + Kidd + Law: Luffy can't solo Kaido. Law will assist Luffy and Kidd in dealing damage. I don't think Law is strong enough to directly do damage versus Kaido if he didn't get a powerup since Dressrossa. Doffy was scared shitless against Kaido but he completely overpowered Law. 

Queen vs Sanji: Queen is a very flamboyant person.. a bit like an Okama.. you know... the type of person that Sanji hates. Queen is also a biomechanical engineer and I wonder if Sanji's raid suit can counter his poison and other weapons?

Denjiro, Ashura Doji, Kawamatsu, Jinbei vs Smoothie + Perospero + Daifuku. I don't see who else on the Alliance side is strong enough to face Big Mom's strongest subordinates.

Robin vs Kanjuro: Robin used to be a covert spy in her past organizations and betray them. She's also able to make a clone of herself just like Kanjuro. Also revenge for ryunosuke.

Franky, Brook, Chopper, Nami, rest of the scabbards vs Flying 6 or some Numbers: it's about time we see the other strawhats go all out.

Kinemon (or Momonosuke) vs Orochi : Leader of the scabbard vs shogun who usurped the throne.

Big Mom vs God Ussop: Nobody else on Luffy's side can take on a yonko 1v1 except Ussop. All jokes aside, I don't think Big Mom will participate in this battle. I think she will be incapacitated in one way or another like in Whole Cake Island.",46,1584750674,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fm62p9/matchup_predictions_of_the_final_battle/,OnePiece,1

With the war about to begin (HYPE) I don't think someone like X-Drake will be enough to record it, I don't think he'll have the time to begin with.  Morgans is busy with the reverie so I don't think he'll be there. There's no point for Kaido to broadcast this war either. This war can't happen without anybody seeing it, I feel like it won't have as much impact if the whole world finds out about it a few days later. Normally around this time(right before the big event) Oda introduces the character/device that will tell the whole world what about to happen.

fm2gaz,thouxan77,How to power scale,"In my personal opinion instead of ranking do it in tiers because some characters are around the same level i.e. all the yonko however in this power scale people from tier S and above cannot be beaten 1on1 vs someone in the below tier and I'll explain why 

Tier SS: Dragon Imu [PIRATE KING LEVEL]

Tier S:  Shanks Kaido Big Mom Blackbeard Gorosei
[YONKO LEVEL]

Tier A: Akainu Mihawk Luffy Garp

[TOP TIER ADMIRAL LEVEL]

Tier A1: Benn Beckham Shiryu Kizaru Aokiji Kidd 

[MID TIER ADMIRAL LEVEL ]

Tier B:  Fuji Greenbull  Yasopp Lucky Roo King Marco Sengoku  

[LOW TIER ADMIRAL LEVEL]

Tier C: Katakuri Queen [ THE REST IS COMMANDER LEVEL]

Tier D: Smoothie Cracker  Jack 

Tier E: Snack Hancock Kuma Urouge Dofllamingo 

Tier F: Law Hawkins X drake Bege 

Firstly I'll a dress TIER SS : 

Imu : it's obvious because he's the King of the world he's obviously going to be strong and probably going to be the main villian at the end 

Dragon : the reason being that he's the world's most wanted and he and his revolutionary army a threatening the balance of power considering that the balance is the 3 great powers with 2 aligned against 1 so he and his army is rivalling that is insane 

He luffy father so he must be very strong it makes no sense for garp to be fighting Roger and wb and top and being arguably in his prime yonko level for an admiral is insane then luffy will surpass Roger and arguably be stronger so he's will be pirate king level so from those deduction dragon must be inbetween meaning that in his prime he should be able to beat everybody except prime Roger and wb and luffy eos and imu 

Thirdly is that in my personal opinion he has a admiral level right hand thats in secrest so dragon must be yonko level or above 

And finally his mission is to overthrow the wg to do that u need to fight the admirals gorosei cp0 etc. No way is someone like dragon who we haven't seen fight who so calculated and has all these opposition weaker than admiral he must be at minimum yonko level and plus if 4 of his commanders were able to fight 2 admirals and I believe that he has a true right hand man who isn't savi because there's evidence for that then his true RH should fight on par with an admiral 

Tier S: is self explanatory yonko are feared government are so shook they need to get the 7 warlords to equal the yonko and even then is not enough so yh 

Gorosei is interesting because not many people would think so I think they are all yonko level is because the wg have kept power for 800 years for them to do that they need to be string and I believe all the gorosei are fighters and are insanely strong look at the dialogue they have with akainu Shanks and sengoku they don't even cower infront of them and they act as if they can get rid of them easy so yh I have more points but cba.

Tier A: akainu and Mihawk is obvious so is garp the shooker is luffy and I'll explain why he's here I'm assuming full mastery if armament and observation luffy in gear 4 should be able to give anybody who ain't a yonko a high diff fight people need to remember the only reason why the admirals where able to dick around as people say in marineford was of superior haki mastery (observation and armament ) luffy has got both and he got better armanat than the admirals and in my personal opinion g4 has the destructive power of doing damage to an admiral plus luffy is about to go defeat kaido and bm I think by end of wano he's a legit yonko but rn he's top tier admiral",20,1584737277,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fm2gaz/how_to_power_scale/,OnePiece,1

fm104c,Seeker275,What Happened at the World Summit,"I know everyone‚Äôs all anxious over what happened during the World Summit and I know there are tons of theories about it as well. As for me, I decided to reorganize on what we know so far and came up with my own theories on what happened. Oda himself said ‚Äúthings are going to be grim. Sabo will‚Ä¶!! Vivi will‚Ä¶!! Hancock will‚Ä¶!! AAAAAAAA‚Ä¶!!!‚Äù

As we all know some sort of incident happened after the summit. But according to Morgans, there were multiple incidents, all happening simultaneously. Incidents involving Alabasta, Sabo, casualties, and an unnamed killer. Morgans seems like the type of reporter who doesn‚Äôt bother with truthful facts, he just takes whatever‚Äôs juicy and slaps it on the front page and leaves it to the imagination of the populace.

As we know Monkey D. Dragon‚Äôs goal was to declare war on the Celestial Dragons and he sent Sabo, Karasu, Lindbergh, and Morley to infiltrate Mariejois. While there, they scoped out the castle and discovered their comrade, Kuma, a slave. Sabo says that if they are going to rescue him, then there will only be two possible outcomes: success or death. According to Blackbeard, Sabo's group fought Fujitora and Ryokugyu in Mariejois on Day 4 of the Summit to rescue Kuma. I‚Äôm not sure what exactly happened, but from what I can tell, Sabo and the other Commanders pulled a ‚ÄúFisher Tiger‚Äù and as a result, got attacked by Fujitora, Ryokugyu, and possibly Cipher Pol. After the incident was published Makino, the Dadan Family, and the Revolutionary Army were all shocked that something bad had happened to Sabo. Dragon and Ivankov refuse to believe it, until they have all the detailed facts.

Then there‚Äôs the other incident involving Alabasta. According to Garp, something occurred after the Summit, it involved Alabasta, and the Marines were working on resolving the situation. Ever since Cobra met Robin, he intended to ask the World Government about the Poneglyphs and how his ancestors were involved. The Nefertari Family was one of the nineteen other royal families to create the World Government, but unlike them, they did not abandon their country to live in Mary Geoise. Because of that, the Elder Stars consider the Nefertari Family to be traitors, since their ancestors preferred to stay in Alabasta instead of joining the other Kings who moved to Mary Geoise. They aren‚Äôt the only ones, their leader, Im, has shown a hostile interest in Luffy, Blackbeard, Shirahoshi, and Vivi, having cut apart pictures of the first three while holding a picture of the fourth. Once he/she sat on the Empty Throne, the Elders asked Im the name of the ""light"" that needed to be extinguished from history. Considering what the World Government did to Ohara when they began studying the Poneglyphs and the WG‚Äôs resentment towards the Nefertari Family, I fear that all of Alabasta is in danger.

Now here come my theories. Morgans mentioned something about casualties and a killer, he also mentioned something bad happened to Sabo. And Garp mentioned the Navy resolving an incident involving Alabasta. At first, I thought the two incidents were connected, with Sabo being framed for killing Cobra. But I realized that A) That sounds like something Cipher Pol would want Morgans to write; and B) The timing was off, the incident involving Sabo was on Day 4 of the Summit, during his fight with Fujitora, Ryokugyu, and possibly Cipher Pol. The incident involving Alabasta occured after the Summit. 

My theory is that Sabo was supposedly killed during the declaration of war, but knowing Sabo, he‚Äôs cheated death before. On the other hand Oda states ‚ÄúSabo will‚Ä¶‚Äù so most likely he was captured and will probably be sent to either Impel Down or to be executed. This would kinda make more sense considering he was up against 2 Admirals and possibly Lucci. I‚Äôm not entirely sure whether the other commanders escaped or not, or whether they succeeded in rescuing Kuma or not.

As for Alabasta, we all saw what the WG did to Ohara when they were caught studying the Poneglyphs and the Void Century, not to mention the Elders consider the Nefertari Family as traitors for not entering Mariejois. Although they say they want to ‚Äúavoid conflict‚Äù, my theory is that when Cobra started to question the Poneglyphs and his ancestors, they ordered Cipher Pol to assassinate him in order to make sure that their secret doesn't leak. Then there‚Äôs Im, either taking Vivi prisoner or attempting to kill her as well in order to end the royal bloodline and extinguish the ‚ÄúLight‚Äù they mentioned. This kind of stunt would obviously throw all of Alabasta in an uproar, that‚Äôs probably why they sent Cipher Pol to force Morgans to cover it up. But Morgans published it anyway. After the story was released, Alabasta must‚Äôve started rioting over the death and abduction of their beloved monarchs. Garp mentioned the Navy being sent to quell the riots, in a situation like this, there is no ‚Äúbest case scenario‚Äù. Knowing the Navy, the ‚Äúbad case scenario‚Äù will be that they sent a high ranking officer to fill in as a viceroy or puppet king, similar to when Captain Morgan ruled Shell Town, or Cipher Pol ruling Enies Lobby. The ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù is that in order to make sure Pluton is not discovered and/or that its citizens don‚Äôt rise against the WG, they ordered a Buster Call on Alabasta. Normally the Government would try to cover an incident like this up by fabricating lies, but since Morgans flew the coop (pun intended), their plans will eventually catch the attention of the Straw Hats.

flzggb,KingDworld,Anime Female designs and nosebleedings,"I post it here because this is the subreddit i like the most but it's about the anime media in general.

I have a serious question:

WHY DO FEMALE ANIME CHARACTERS ALWAYS LACK BOOTY!!!!!
 
One Piece is particularly concerned bcause we know the attention Oda gives to our ladies' breasts but for some reason they're all flat from their back down. (Not here to bodyshame anybody btw, all bodytimes are sexy)
At First i thought that maybe its just a thing with the japanese, maybe they're all boob guys. But I'm not japanese nor am I racist and within a population there is always a huge diversity of tastes and ideals even if there remains certain stereotypes.
I thought about it and I came to a semi serious theory.
We know how in the manga media, the nosebleeding is here to metaphorize excitement and *hm*boner*... There's not any scientific link between excitement and nosebleeding at all but I got a side theory. The gimmick could come from the legend of Attila who died from nosebleeding in his bed the night he was celebrating his wedding with his new beatiful wife. This is not the accurate story if you wanna learn about it it's all over the internet. Maybe the inspiration rised from that.
But that's about the male side of things

When it comes to the females, especially in shonen, as for the males, sexuality has to be censored while at the same time, implied in order to tickle the young boy's ""interest"". So, drawing larger boobs is a way to emphasize sexuality without being too obvious since boobs are not really sexual. Putting the emphasis on butts would be way too disturbing because it implies the sexual act right away, it's not subtle enough.
Furthermore you can notice that in ecchi and even hentai, the bodytypes become kinda more diverse. Not to mention the recent emulation around the ""thicc"" characters.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. I'm aware that not many people would care about that since many guys (or girls) like the big boobs body type anyways. But I find interesting the way the manga medium has to depict certain realities and emotions.",21,1584727013,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/flzggb/anime_female_designs_and_nosebleedings/,OnePiece,1

flyjfs,EmperorSahir,Chapter 975 Reaction,"Denjiro's character is just very fitting in this chapter. Since he has infiltrated Orochi he knew about all information on both sides. So he knew about yasuei's change of plan and the plan that leaked to Orochi. Knowing both sides he thought that Kin'emon leaked false information to the traitor that is why Denjiro saw this as Kin'emon's smart plan. But this was Denjiro's perspective at first. Then came the best timing for Denjiros reveal since he have just been waiting for the traitor to reveal himself, after the traitors big reveal this is the right timing for Denjiro to also reveal himself. So when you look at it, Denjiro was playing along with what he thought as Kin'emons smart plan. So knowing who the traitor is Denjiro reveals ""Kin'emons smart plan"" to everyone. Now everybody is thinking what Denjiro has thought but the truth is that Kin'emon had just misunderstood yasuei's message. The 20 year long plan and sacrifice of Yasuei has just been misunderstood by Kin'emon which led them to this day that gives them hope. Hope to fulfill Odens wish.

fly27l,Alpha_ii_Omega,"Guys, please respect logic of positive and negative feats","One thing that irritates me to no one end on this forum are powerscaling arguments where people refuse to bow down and accept the rules of logic. For example, there are positive and negative feats in One Piece relative to any given character -- X character beat Y character, or X character lost to Y character. 

And not all feats in One Piece can be used in powerscaling arguments -- especially negative feats used for plot convenience to generate tension. 

This came up in a recent discussion about the power level of Dorry and Brogy. They were able to defeat the giant goldfish (pretty insane feat), but then Brogy was easily subdued by the pretty weak Mr. 3. Those feats are clearly at odds with each other, so which one takes precedent? The obvious answer is the goldfish feat. Mr. 3 defeating Brogy doesn't count, because that is a plot convenience to generate tension. 

Another one is Luffy struggling with Doflamingo's clone. People used this to argue that Luffy had no chance against Doflamingo, because he struggled with the clone and was even 'defeated' by it, needing to be rescued. This was just done for plot convenience to create a cliffhanger, and has literally no powerscaling relevance. 

So please, please people -- stop bringing up stupid arguments when it comes to negative feats for a character, especially if those feats had ANYTHING to do with a cliffhanger or generating tension.",45,1584722221,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fly27l/guys_please_respect_logic_of_positive_and/,OnePiece,1

flxuky,Smokeysama,Wano Arc - Thoughts and Speculations (**Manga Spoilers**),"To put it simply, this Wano arc is awesome. I wanted to make a post and maybe open up a discussion on your thoughts so far and where the story may be headed. 



First is the fact that X-Drake is an undercover Marine and the captain of their new Sword unit. Even though he was told the Marines wouldn't be able to make a move on Wano, I don't think Oda would have revealed this to us for no reason. It might not make much of a difference during the actual raid, but I feel like it'll come up again once it ends.



Dragon is on the move. The last time we saw him, he and Ivankov were reading about Sabo's supposed 'death' at the Reverie and said they need to go confirm the details for themselves. Personally, I dont think Sabo's dead. Maybe he overheard Coby and X-Drake's conversation about the alliance between Kaido and Lin Lin. If that's the case, I could totally see Sabo losing his cool knowing that 2 Yonko are actively trying to murder his brother, messing up whatever they went to the Reverie to do and getting the other RA Commanders he was with caught up. Either he's somehow on his way to Wano, or whatever the situation is could be what leads into the next arc.



Blackbeard is also on the move. People have been theorizing that he might show up at the end of Wano and take Kaido's Devil Fruit. Rogersbase had a theory that Moria would come with Blackbeard for revenge, and use his ability to steal Kaido's shadow and make a super strong zombie with it. I could see this happening, but since Blackbeard's crew hunt Devil Fruit users, I could also see them killing Moria and giving his fruit to another crew member. If they show up it'll probably be closer to the end of the final struggle.



Jimbei and Neko are still unaccounted for. We haven't seen or heard from Jimbei since escaping Whole Cake, and since the newspapers or Big Mom haven't said anything it's safe to assume he is indeed alive and well. The last time we saw Neko he was being refused by Marco, who also gave him a message to give to Luffy. With the numbers disadvantage, one of them is bound to show up late with some much needed reinforcements (or both, who knows.) Jimbei should have been able to leave Whole Cake at the longest a day after the Strawhats, so he should've been here. I think maybe after their escape the Sun Pirates wanted to continue to support Jimbei and the Strawhats, and are possibly rounding up members of the Grand Fleet (though I have no idea how they would even know about the SHGF, being that Jimbei or any of the Sun Pirates were there when it was formed.) I don't think Marco will come with Neko, but if he were to encounter Izo he'd definitely come, maybe spurring a handful more to come as well. 




Caribou. The last we saw of him he helped take over Udon by smothering the Boss Pond Snail. He was captured and brought there by X-Drake, and he also knows that Shirahoshi is Poseiden. Luffy agreed to let him escape with them on their ship too so we'll definitely see him again, the question is when and how? 






Issho. We know he's a samurai from Wano, he absolutely hates the Warlord system, and has seen something so bad or evil he took his own eyesight. We last saw him at the Reverie talking with Green Bull. I think we could possibly get some information regarding the life and family he had in Wano, or maybe even a personal appearance.




It's pretty much all speculation at this point, I just wanted to bring up some topics I've been wondering about week to week and maybe get your thoughts and opinions as well.",4,1584721505,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/flxuky/wano_arc_thoughts_and_speculations_manga_spoilers/,OnePiece,1

flw2uw,Locky_Strikto,The One Piece Theory,"I have figured out what is One Piece.  
Oda has planted One Piece with the words written below  
""Thank you for the 26 years of support! Thank you all for reading!""  
Why did Roger and his crew laughed? First, we have to re-look at the scene again. Roger laughed before his crew did, what did he realized before any of his crew could?  
It simple actually, it was something he know closely related to him than the others. It was none other than the fact that he left for sea 26 years ago. They all laughed because they realized that are all part of a story. He decides to set this up so whoever comes later will realized that this world is just a story.  
This is where you say, ""This doesn't make any sense!""  
Have you guys forget who the author is? It's GODA! Why did he set the current story specifically for 26 years after Roger's execution? IT WAS ALL FORESHADOWING! YES! The next person who read it will realized that Roger has set him/her up 26 years ago and laugh at it and Roger specifically named the island Laugh Tale so that the person will realized that this was all a laughable tale, meaning he/she is all just part of this tale!  
GODA is a genius, and what better way to show that?  
Some of you might realized it now, yes, One Piece will end 26 years after its debut! NOW THE MESSAGE COMES IN FULL CIRCLE! WELL PLAYED GODA! WELL PLAYED!  
However, GODA was not perfect, he made 1 mistake when he first started. He chosen 24 years to start off with, but halfway through this journey he realized it and rectify this mistake by giving it 2 years TS. Given the fact that when Roger actually started his journey is pretty much unknown... If One Piece doesn't end 26 years after the debut, GODA can just rewrite this number in anyway he wants and add more TS to make sure the number matches for us.

flvhka,Universenumber1,One piece is a crappy series idea.,"Remember that one kid in elementary school, the kid that would always go ""My guy's power is to be a hillion jillion times stronger than your guy ever will be!""? This series is what happens when that kid gets a budget.

Frankly, it's nothing short of amazing that this series ever succeeded at all. Just about everything about it is awful, with no indication that anything is ever going to get better. How does it suck? Let's start with the main character...

Luffy is the dumbest, most boring character in shonen, and a strong contender for the dumbest, most boring character in all of fiction. First off, his backstory so dumb and simple that it might as well not even exist, so immediately we're left wondering why we should even care about him. Next, he decides to just drop his entire life and become a pirate because... he wanted to. So now he has basically no motivation either, so none of his actions make any sense. He proceeds to then cheat all logic and reason and get the greatest superpower ever again for no reason, complete with a stupid-as-hell design (seriously, what kinda hat is that).

The end result of such a poor character is as one-dimensional as its starting point: a guy whose sole trait is a single dumb joke. That will never, ever stop. If the creative force behind Superman can be summed up as a monkey pressing an ""Increase Power"" button, then that creative force behind One Piece  is a plot armor-monkey that broke the muffin button and went to go throw shit at everybody that was putting in actual effort.

And this laziness spreads to every part of the series, at times even delving into a general mean-spirited attitude. Zoro is just a dumbass whose entire purpose is to mock everything that's actually fun about anime. The villains aren't interesting or memorable, and they leave almost as soon as they get introduced. And every other character is a forgettable one-dimensional cardboard cutout that was probably thought up during a bathroom break, with no character arcs or development at all. In fact, the setup ENSURES that Luffy can never change because if he ever did develop into a caring person, he would end all crime and evil everywhere in an instant (like the Flash if the Flash was somehow even more poorly-written) The only character that's worth the audience's investment is Usopp, the only guy in the entire series that genuinely wants to do good and help people. You know, like a real hero. So what does the series do? It shits on him at every opportunity and makes it abundantly clear that this guy and everything he believes in and fights for means absolutely nothing.

In fact, just about everything in the series means absolutely nothing. The only ""theme"" in the series is that if you're not a pirate, you suck forever and deserve to be shoved in the dirt whenever possible. Your beliefs? Worthless. Your altruism? Fuck that. Your conviction and drive? Completely irrelevant. Everything about you that makes you a unique and good individual? Give up now, because you will never be worth anything thanks to the guy that lucked into infinite power and doesn't give a shit about anyone.

 Just the idea that such a stupid idea could even get off the ground is nauseating. But it doesn't get truly awful until you find out just how it started to succeed. Apparently the entire reason it did is that a one-in-a-billion fluke happened where the exact right executive just happened to see it by pure chance and threw money at it. Oda seemingly took this in good stride by riding a wave of success he didn't earn and phoning in everything he ever did to spite everyone who was working their asses off trying to get even 1/100th of what he just lucked into. It takes a special kind of person to go out of their way to laugh about submitting half finished rough drafts while everyone that actually cares about the craft is working hard to make genuine, likeable pirates. I would be tempted to say that the setup of the show and the attitudes in it are a meta-commentary on Oda's own views of the industry and his position within it, but this series is nowhere NEAR smart enough for something like that. So I'm sticking to my original theory that Oda is just an asshole.  


Oda isn't a good creator. He's not even a decent one. He's just an asshole that got lucky, and his stupid ideas should have been left in a dumpster behind MC Donalds where it belongs.",24,1584712822,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/flvhka/one_piece_is_a_crappy_series_idea/,OnePiece,1

flusnv,Amirkasem,Big mom is going to die but Lin Lin will live," The title is a sort of a click bait but I will explain . I believe that the big mom we know will die in the sense that big mom the pirate will die . 

Confusing huh ? Lol 

Well this goes back to how big mom originally got her powers to begin with. We are led to believe that big mom ate the children along with mother Carmel and this somehow allowed her to receive the powers ! 

We Know that from her abilities that she has displayed that she can basically give inanimate objects life by giving them portions of her own or others souls !  With her own souls she creates her weapons with other souls she creates her homies ! I do believe she could create homies with her own soul but I believe it would be a waste of her soul so she uses the people that live in her territory as a source! Her own soul is used to give to her weapons bec I assume the stronger will that was attached to the person the stronger the object becomes when brought to life ! 

Now the theory portion I believe that big mom is not the one In charge of her own body. I believe that when and if big mom ate mother Carmel she not only inherited the powers of the fruit but also her personality. 

Recently big mom suffered from amnesia and seemed to revert back to her personality as a child . If she forgot her memories then why would her general demeanor be reverted back to her child like self . She acted very very similar to how she did as a child ! Almost action for action . If an adult loses their memory then they won‚Äôt wake up and act like a 5 year old . Their general demeanor would be that of an adult. Big mom did not show this. 

I think that in this arc or the next their will be through some happening that big mom will rid herself of mother Carmel influences and come to terms with her past traumas. 

It could be that she comes to terms with her emotional trauma hence becoming or reverting to her younger self mentally . The big mom we know now could be a combination of herself and mother Carmel . When the picture of mother Carmel was broken she seemed to lose control of herself. This could be the dormant ‚ÄúLin Lin‚Äù freaking out and the more surface level personality ‚Äúbig mom‚Äù losing control over herself . Allowing for a conflict in the body . 

So To sum things up , I believe the personality that is big mom will essentially ‚Äúdie‚Äù allowing for the actual lin lin to come back . With this her dream of living and eating with all types of people could be achieved wholeheartedly through actual acceptance rather then fear. This could be how the luffy and company defeat big mom in this arc . Not through her death but through saving her . 

Head cannon twist: this is just some complete speculation but I believe the situation I believe to be involved explained above could lead to explaining black beards ability and souls !",16,1584709968,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/flusnv/big_mom_is_going_to_die_but_lin_lin_will_live/,OnePiece,1

flum5o,eio_uwu,why one piece?,"so i'm sure you've seen this questions tons of times before but i've always been intrigued by one piece and stories i've heard about it. it's that type of anime that i think i'd really like and is probably right up my alley, but i've just never brought myself to start it.

i need someone to give an explanation as to why i should start one piece and actually watch it (i prefer anime over manga)

here are some of my questions i would love answered:

\- what's the best part about one piece?

\- why not another anime like bleach, or gintama?

\- how long would it take me to catch up to the anime? HAHA probably forever

\- what should i expect?

flu7jv,lucifer_18,regarding the yami yami no mi,"considering its the devil fruit of the final pirate boss,shouldn't it be a little good??? It has so many weaknesses such as increasing the pain to its own user,df nullification only when in contact,does not work as well as black holes should do...etc

&amp;#x200B;

i mean pre ts,it was  mediocre  fruit,since it could only nullify devil fruits,nothing more .the move black hole dosent work as well as its supposed to where things arent completely obliterated never to be seen again (during his battle vs ace,he uses black hole on buildings,only to bring their ruins back again,ace couldve done more damage with fire tbh)

&amp;#x200B;

now with the introduction of haki,logia users and special paramecia users arent as great and untouchable(as long as you have stronger haki,you can damage them,and the fruit has no uses on non df users).the yami yami no mi is totally useless unless it can be used to farm other devil fruits which can explain why teach has the gura gura no mi

&amp;#x200B;

isnt the fruit a bit overrated btw,its not as strong as people hype it to be,based on what we've seen",4,1584707352,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/flu7jv/regarding_the_yami_yami_no_mi/,OnePiece,1

Right now, that legendary weapon is being used as a grave marker. I‚Äôm not upset about that, I think the coat and flag hanging from it are an iconic image. I‚Äôm just wondering if you think anyone would try to claim that weapon and utilize it in the end war?

I think the only one who could potentially wield it is Weevil, but he‚Äôd have to undergo some serious character development and somewhat be motivated to adopt WB‚Äôs will moving forward. That means Bakkin would have to go. 

What do you guys think? Will WB‚Äôs weapon ever be wielded again? Or is it gonna be a grave marker till end of series?

I saw an image that showed Rayleigh and Shakky's similarities to Mihawk. I thought it was funny because the similarities were not very convincing.

I remember that in Oden's flashback it is shown that Rayleigh think is a bad way how Oden is raising his son, which suggests that he may have already created one. And Roger also comments: ‚Äúit was a while since we had a baby on the crew!‚Äù

I personally think it will be the Auction house trio against Kaido. But I've seen people make fun of and crucify the person who just expresses that he wants Zoro vs Kaido. I understand that Auction trio v/s Kaido makes much more sense plot wise but its fiction and a fan can believe what he wants. I also completely understand that this was actually started becoz some people were saying Zoro will cut Kaido as a fact and it annoyed lot of u guys but if u want to be a sensible person you mustn't do whats called 'reverse racism' basically bcoz Orochi's clan was discriminated he now is destroying Wano which is stupid, period. I just thought this was needed to be mentioned if we want to stay away from being a toxic community so I can even believe Aokiji will defeat Kaido bcoz its fiction and its a fiction of Goda so yeah you can disagree with people but don't hate on them.

flq3be,Hellrazor725,Kinemon theory (SPOILERS),"Something is really bothering me about Kinemon. It seems that so far in this arc everyone in Wano isn't aware of devil fruit abilities and thinks that it is sorcery. Everyone from Wano that we know that has a devil fruit except for Kinemom is related to Orochi but we don't know where Orochi and his family got their devil fruits from. I think there is some hinting going on that they got their devil fruits from some source like the world government or they just had the devil fruits hidden somewhere that only their family knew.

But my question is, where did Kinemon get his devil fruit from? He claims that he ate it a long time ago but if that is true then knowledge of him eating a mysterious fruit should be known more. I know people have theories that Kinemon has the epithet that he is a trickster and can actually create amazing disguises. This relates a little bit too much to Kanjuro's situation where he was actually the traitor and he faked being bad at using his devil fruit. I have a feeling that there is something hidden about Kinemon as well. It was also a bit strange that Kanjuro said to Kinemon to drop the disguises and then Kinemon almost without hesitation slashed him... as if it was going along with the plan to reveal Kanjuro. Having two traitors would definitely be quite a twist. Also I can't remember, but did Kinemon actually end up meeting his wife? If not, then his excuse to not meet his wife might indicate that something happened to the real Kinemon and this could just be one using his disguise. This latter part is definitely a stretch but I thought I would put it out there.",25,1584685145,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/flq3be/kinemon_theory_spoilers/,OnePiece,1

flol06,Seeker275,WHAT HAPPENED AT THE WORLD SUMMIT?,"I know everyone‚Äôs all anxious over what happened during the World Summit and I know there are tons of theories about it as well. As for me, I decided to reorganize on what we know so far and came up with my own theories on what happened. Oda himself said ‚Äúthings are going to be grim. Sabo will‚Ä¶!! Vivi will‚Ä¶!! Hancock will‚Ä¶!! AAAAAAAA‚Ä¶!!!‚Äù

As we all know some sort of incident happened after the summit. But according to Morgans, there were multiple incidents, one happening right after the other. Incidents involving Alabasta, Sabo, casualties, and an unnamed killer. Morgans seems like the type of reporter who doesn‚Äôt bother with truthful facts, he just takes whatever is juicy and slaps it on the front page and leaves it to the imagination of the populace.

As we know Monkey D. Dragon‚Äôs goal was to declare war on the Celestial Dragons and he sent Sabo, Karasu, Lindbergh, and Morley to infiltrate  Mariejois . While there, they scoped out the castle and discovered their comrade, Kuma, a slave. Sabo says that if they are going to rescue him, then there will only be two possible outcomes: success or death. According to Blackbeard, Sabo's group fought Fujitora and Ryokugyu in Mary Geoise on Day 4 of the Summit to rescue Kuma. I‚Äôm not sure what exactly happened, but from what I can tell, Sabo and the other Commanders pulled a ‚ÄúFisher Tiger‚Äù and as a result, got attacked by Fujitora, Ryokugyu, and possibly Cipher Pol. After the incident was published Makino, the Dadan Family, and the Revolutionary Army were all shocked that something bad had happened to Sabo. Dragon and Ivankov refuse to believe it, until they have all the detailed facts.

Then there‚Äôs the other incident involving Alabasta. According to Garp, something occurred after the Summit, it involved Alabasta, and the Marines were working on resolving the situation. Ever since Cobra met Robin, he intended to ask the World Government about the Poneglyphs and how his ancestors were involved. The Nefertari Family was one of the nineteen other royal families to create the World Government, but unlike them, they did not abandon their country to live in Mariejois. Because of that, the Elder Stars consider the Nefertari Family to be traitors, since their ancestors preferred to stay in Alabasta instead of joining the other Kings who moved to Mariejois. They aren‚Äôt the only ones, their leader, Im, has shown a hostile interest in Luffy, Blackbeard, Shirahoshi, and Vivi, having cut apart pictures of the first three while holding a picture of the fourth. Once he/she sat on the Empty Throne, the Elders asked Im the name of the ""light"" that needed to be extinguished from history. Considering what the World Government did to Ohara when they began studying the Poneglyphs and the WG‚Äôs resentment towards the Nefertari Family, I fear that all of Alabasta is in danger.

Now here come my theories. Morgans mentioned something about casualties and a killer, he also mentioned something bad happened to Sabo. And Garp mentioned the Navy resolving an incident involving Alabasta. At first, I thought the two incidents were connected, with Sabo being framed for killing Cobra. But I realized that A) That sounds like something Cipher Pol would want Morgans to write; and B) The timing was off, the incident involving Sabo was on Day 4 of the Summit, during his fight with Fujitora, Ryokugyu, and possibly Cipher Pol. The incident involving Alabasta occured after the Summit. 

My theory is that Sabo was supposedly killed during the declaration of war, but knowing Sabo, he‚Äôs cheated death before. On the other hand Oda states ‚ÄúSabo will‚Ä¶‚Äù so most likely he was captured and will probably be sent to either Impel Down or to be executed. This would kinda make more sense considering he was up against 2 Admirals and possibly Lucci. I‚Äôm not entirely sure whether the other commanders escaped or not, or whether they succeeded in rescuing Kuma or not.

As for Alabasta, we all saw what the WG did to Ohara when they were caught studying the Poneglyphs and the Void Century, not to mention the Elders consider the Nefertari Family as traitors for not entering Mariejois. Although they say they want to ‚Äúavoid conflict‚Äù, my theory is that when Cobra started to question the Poneglyphs and his ancestors, they ordered Cipher Pol to assassinate him in order to make sure that their secret doesn't leak. Then there‚Äôs Im, either taking Vivi prisoner or attempting to kill her as well in order to end the royal bloodline and extinguish the ‚ÄúLight‚Äù they mentioned. This kind of stunt would obviously throw all of Alabasta in an uproar, that‚Äôs probably why they sent Cipher Pol to force Morgans to cover it up. But Morgans published it anyway. After the story was released, Alabasta must‚Äôve started rioting over the death and abduction of their beloved monarchs. Garp mentioned the Navy being sent to quell the riots. In a situation like this, there is no ‚Äúbest case scenario‚Äù. Knowing the Navy, the ‚Äúbad case scenario‚Äù will be that they sent a high ranking officer to fill in as a viceroy or puppet king, similar to when Captain Morgan ruled Shell Town, or Cipher Pol ruling Enies Lobby. The ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù is that in order to make sure Pluton is not discovered and/or that its citizens don‚Äôt rise against the WG, they ordered a Buster Call on Alabasta. Normally the Government would try to cover an incident like this up by fabricating lies, but since Morgans flew the coop (pun intended), their plans will eventually catch the attention of the Straw Hats.

flnume,Shuroromuda1,Expectated awards for Wano arc.,"So we are probably nearing half of the Wano arc and, therefore, it is time to start thinking who are gonna win the season awards.

MVP - I am divided betwenn Kin and Luffy. On one hand Kin is the leader of the Scabbards and is orchestrating the whole plan. However, if Luffy smashes in the war and manages to beat Kaidou alone, he would be the undeniable MVP.

DPOA - Well, the defensive player of the arc has to be someone who hold his own and helped the alliance along the arc. I am willing to give this to Law because despite he being arrested and tortured, he didnt bulge.

MIP - The most improved player has to be someone whose character development has been steady and we can perceive a difference in the end of the arc. Gonna be very disappointed if Momo does not win this one.

ROA - The rookie of the arc has to be someone who was been introduced this arc and has made a hell of an impact. Denjiro will win in a landslide.

COTA - The coach of the arc will be the old man Hyou teaching the one of the MVPs candidate how to improve on his haki.",17,1584674711,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/flnume/expectated_awards_for_wano_arc/,OnePiece,1

flmg4d,Riftwalkin,Zoan Fruits ideas that might be interesting to see in the future,"so far we have seen all of the kind of zoan fruits and by far the most intense and interesting ones are prehistoric and mythical fruits. I've been thinking of the next mystical fruit that will see and I cannot take these out of mind. The main theme of One Piece is pirate and how vast, beautiful and dangerous is the sea. In the era of pirates, there were a lot of legends or mythical monster that pirates ""confronted"" or ""seem"". These legends can vary from differents folklore or mythology, but they are definitely legends of the sea worth mentioning. Which is where One Piece is supposed to be focused on. There's a lot of legends or monsters of the sea, but I'm just gonna put there the most interesting ones.

1. Kraken:(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Colossal_octopus_by_Pierre_Denys_de_Montfort.jpg/200px-Colossal_octopus_by_Pierre_Denys_de_Montfort.jpg)

The Kraken is a giant Octopus that brings terror upon those sailors who sail in the waters where it lives. The Kraken would wrap its large tentacles around the ships and pull the ships to the bottom of the sea, devouring them along the way. 

I like this one because the hybrid form or transformation would be really helpful for the user, using tentacles is a plus

2. Lernean Hydra: (https://www.ecured.cu/images/3/3b/Hidra.jpg)

The Lernean Hydra was a nine-headed serpent that lived on the coast of Lerna. If one of the hydra‚Äôs heads were cut off, two more would grow back in its place. The Lernean Hydra also lived near the entrance of the underworld. 

We have seen a user similar to this one, Orochi has a mythical fruit that allows him to transform in a dragon with eight heads(correct me if I'm wrong) so the full transformation for the user would be chaotic, image all the thing the user could do.

3.J√∂rmungandr:(https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/5/58/Ganger.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190830094234)

This serpent sea grew so large that it was able to surround the earth and grasp its own tail. As a result, it received the name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. 

I'm not saying the user would be so large that it will be able to surround One Piece seas, but it should be cool to see a different kind of species out there, not only calamari or pulp.

4. Taniwha(https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/413/885/large/chase-cabebe-taniwha.jpg?14459912440)

Taniwha may be considered highly respected kaitiaki (protective guardians) of people and places, or in some traditions as dangerous, predatory beings, which for example would kidnap women to have as wives.

Idk this one seems really cool, maybe the user could be the guardian of an island or something like that. 

5. Devil Whale(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Moby_Dick_p510_illustration.jpg)

The Devil Whale is a legendary demonic whale-like sea monster, (or a sea turtle in some legends). According to myths, this whale is of enormous size and could swallow entire ships. It also resembles an island when it's sleeping, and unsuspecting sailors put ashore on its back. When the sailors start a fire, the Devil Whale awakes and attacks the ship, dragging it to the bottom of the sea. Because of this Christianity began associating the whale with the Devil.

I could see the user being one of the Kaido men guarding the island with a user that could transform into something big and chaotic.

I know that all of this may be impossible because, from the beginning, the user of devil fruits cannot swim or move in the water. But I think these are cool ideas for mythical creatures of the seas. There is plenty of mythical creatures that come from different folklore or mythology, but I found these ones the only worth mentioning right now.

flet3j,readerashwin,What if Luffy dies at MarineFord?,"This is what I think will happen. I hope it doesn't sound too absurd. I will try to give my reasoning to why I feel certain things would or would not happen.


The Crew: I believe Ussop would awake his haki. He would make a 180¬∞ shift in character and become the captain of the crew. The remaining crew would be almost the same just be more depressed sad and serious. They would not be as carefree as they are now.   Luffy's will will be passed down to the crew. An additional member will join the crew: Coby. He would be disillusioned by the Marines, and decide to take the baton from Luffy along side Ussop. 

Here is a start...you guys can build from here on, or give your own thoughts ignoring my opinions. Just interested to know how certain things would play out.
1. Reverie
2. Dragon, Sabo and Revolutionaries
3. Warlords - I doubt if Luffy dies the alliance with Law can take place. The crew would be distrustful. Maybe, they would have the samurais but not Law.
4. Marines - Garp would retire and drink or eat himself to death, I guess. Coby would be absent from Sword. Not sure if that would impact as much.
5. Doffy vs Coby and Zoro they can win together i guess. But not if only one of them fights him. Maybe, they will ally with Law, there. 
6. Sanji would go and without luffy, i doubt they would risk going after him. Zoro would be against it and I doubt Ussop would take that risk. They will be generally more cautious. So no Sanji in Wano.",5,1584641901,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/flet3j/what_if_luffy_dies_at_marineford/,OnePiece,0

1. A sworduser joining
2. A pervert
3. A mechanic/scientist
4. A girl
5. A monster

2. Carrot
3. Kinemon
4. Vegapunk

Jinbe would be the monster
Carrot the female
Kinemon the sworduser and pervert 
Vegapunk the scientist

To add to this, Brook only uses one sword and Zoro three. Kinemon would fit the crew with two and Shuisu would still be with the Straw Hats.

Also we saw someone from Wano joined Roger's Crew as were Minks. 

Jinbe is already a given imo.

Now Vegapunk is interesting. I think his story will be much bigger and involve the Gorosei.

Nami and Robin both had stories including Marines and the World Government. What is higher than that?

Vegapunk is a character we do not know anything about. But I feel he will be the last member. Like Jinbe he has been foreshadowed and mentioned for a while and Jinbe became a big part of the story. 

As we are in the endgame of One Piece I feel the last few people joinimg are characters we already have some sort connection with.

fl69kw,RoloEdits,Awakening Might be Tied to Conquerors Haki.,"A lot of people question when Luffy would have time to learn Awakening, with the pattern as one arc being dedicated to some form of Haki. Whole Cake being an improvement to Observation, Wano being and upgrade to Armament, and speculation that Elbaf would be Conquerors. Keep in mind that these boosts are more than just strengthening what he had, its an advancement of utilization. 

My thought is perhaps when he learns to improve Conquerors he will also learn to Awaken. Now you may find it strange how I connect these two things that seem very separate but allow to explain where i'm coming from. 

Firstly, the known users who were able to Awaken:  Katakuri, Donquixote Doflamingo, and the 4 jailers of Impel Down(probably the 5th one too). Other users may have shown hints of Awakening as well such as Boa Hancock, who is able to turn inanimate objects to stone, and Crocodile, Kuzan, Ace and Sakazuki, all being able to change the environment/weather. Last one I want to bring up is chopper. His monster point may be an Awakening as well.

Of these users, 4 are known to have Conquerors Haki: Boa Hancock, Flamingo, Ace and Katakuri. I would argue that Kuzan and Sakazuki would fit having it. Crocodile too. Now whether this is likely or not i'm not hear to pound the table for. The others, Chopper and the Jailers, have shown no signs of conquerors nor do they seem the type to have it.

Chopper may have made a drug that would allow him to go into an Awakened form, and before the time skip showed similar traits to the known awakened Jailers. They all seemed to have lost their sense of self or complex thought as the cost to awaken. Now this could just be the side effect for all Zoan Awakenings but why would they be the only ones with this downside?  Paramecia users have shown to have no downsides and if we speculate that Crocodile, Kuzan, Ace and Sakazuki are also Awakened, they also seem so show no downsides. 

My theory is based on that although the Zoan's we have seen may be awakened, it seems incomplete or maybe even forced. Now it may just be that all users would need to grow used to the form over time to remove downsides, but I have a different thought. That, like chopper, the jailers are a Forced Awakening. If Chopper can come up with a way to achieve this, I think its safe to say that so could the world governments scientists. Namely Vega Punk. 

So how does Conquerors Haki come into play in all this? My thoughts tie into the ""Devil"" in Devil Fruit, and the ""domination"" of Conquerors Haki. Domination in this case not only being the minds of others, but also on ones self and the very environment around said Haki user. Without Conquerors Haki one may lose to the ""Devil"" inside them. This soul would influence the user more as its influence is increased over the user. 

Now Chopper has learned to control his Monster Point post time-skip, and I don't follow this charterer well enough to say for sure, but it may be that he improved the drug in some way or maybe the implication is that Awakening is not exclusive to Conquerors. I'm not sure on either. 

There has to be more use to it than just a cannon fodder nuke. I think the Conqueror/King in the name implies the ability to rule over things. Whether it be to tame, knock people out, change the very environment how they please, or even influence themselves. Reality Warping basically.

This is all just speculation and the story is too big for me to be able to think through everything and this is mainly getting a thought that popped in my head out there to see what people think. If this is flawed then I apologize for making you read through this ramble.",12,1584604556,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fl69kw/awakening_might_be_tied_to_conquerors_haki/,OnePiece,1

his main problem is that he's lazy/a coward and barely trains.

anyone remember obito from naruto? his eyes allowed him to travel to a different dimention and he used it to pass through objects and what not. Our bodies are basically 99% empty space. Similar is the case for other objects. We cant walk thru objects because of something called pauli exclusion principle. Point I'm trying to make here is,  If buggy is able to split his body on sub-atomic level, then control the said pieces however he wishes, it means he can control their energy level. Ofcourse, this would require a LOT of stamina, but that isnt something thats lacking in onepiece world.

Akainu constantly talks about how he should've killed Luffy at Marineford, but Jimbei was a bigger name pirate and a bigger threat at Marineford, yet he only displays regret for not killing Luffy and not Jimbei.

I‚Äôm missing a ton of knowledge but surprisingly I get the bulk of it just through anime podcasts, top 10 lists, etc.

So briefly explain to me what I‚Äôm missing because I‚Äôll never have time to see or read all of it in my adult life. Here‚Äôs what I know:

Everything through Arlong I‚Äôve watched. I know Loguetown. I know most of Skypeia (spelling?) but don‚Äôt remember that old power system they learned there fully. I know most of Alabasta but gave up there watching as a kid. I know most of Sabody Archipelago. I know ‚Äúnothing happened‚Äù in that Gecko Moriah arc (pun was intended cool Zorro moment). I know the premise of Impel Down but no specifics. I know a good bit of Marineford and even watched a tiny bit. I know there‚Äôs a timeskip.

After timeskip I know there‚Äôs Fishman island and there‚Äôs some merman shit and the Joyboy Poneglyph and Noah‚Äôs arc and those theories. I know a bit of Punk Hazard. I know a bit of Dressrosa. (No good specifics on any of this) Wtf is Zou? Talking animals live there? Jack shows up? Some of the samurai and the traitor (I know who the traitor is) likely gave away info that led Jack there? I know a good bit of the Wholecake Island arc except what ends up happening with Sanji‚Äôs fam or why exactly only he left (they‚Äôre power rangers? Do they all live, how does their story wrap?) Mostly just know the Katekuri fight tbh. Does anyone have true fights with Daifuku and Oven? I know most of The Reverie actually in decent detail. I know the back half of Wano (basically the hype chapters with bounties, warlord system going bye bye, the Oden flashbacks in full). I‚Äôve also seen only one movie and it‚Äôs Stampede.

So what did I miss? I know it‚Äôs a lot so hit the main explanations of the arcs I was clearly lost on and or didn‚Äôt even list.

fl3yd4,menokami,Luffy vs Issho Anime Detail,"While rewatching this battle at the end of Dressrosa I noticed a strange detail and had to get some clarity...

Throughout the entire fight there were a couple occasions were Luffy was struck by Issho's gravity ability numerous times and yet he sustained no physical damage, ie. Scratches, scuffs, blood. 

I thought it was just my eyes but then Issho lands Raging Tiger on luffy and literally tailed beast bombed the hokage mountain AND STILL Luffy had no scratch marks.

This leads me to believe that with both DFs belonging to the paramecia class there is a singularity where Luffys elasticity hardcounters Issho's gravity and while it can make him heavy or light it cannot damage luffy like it did to Zoro, making him bleed and fall into a pit much like the low level thug that was swindling Issho at the gambling hall.

I personally think this is a symptom of not enough focus on the SH's post-time-skip. All the fights, all the cool interactions, all the worldbuilding has been based on Luffy, even in Sanji's ""arc"", we got Luffy doing everything and side characters like Bege taking on roles that could easily be accomplished by the SH's. There are a lot of Oda apologists out there who will claim that we are just being ungrateful but look at the evidence. **In the most hyped arc of all OP, one which Oda has said will make Marineford look cute, One Piece sales are down.** I think people are sick of waiting for Oda to deliver with the SH's. From any popularity poll, Zoro and Sanji have double the amount of fans combined. When you shaft these characters to the side and make everything about Luffy, then these fans will no longer invest in the series. 

Oda is not infallible and the fact that many fans are in denial about this and it just adds to that delusion. Oda's editors need to remind Oda of what made OP great, the SH's and their camaraderie. He needs to give fans who have invested in his series some payoff. Oda like any writer owes everything he has to his fans so don't come at me with the ""you should be grateful"" response. So far Wano has had nearly 70 chapters and nothing that makes ""Marineford cute"" has happened. This is an arc that has been hyped for years and unfortunately, Oda is not delivering. The old excuse of wait he is just building to it is nonsense, because fans have been waiting forever for him to deliver and nothing has happened.

Oda:""Huh...!?You remember things over 40 vol. ago!?N...no,they dont!!Lalalalala (note:its the sound in japanese someone makes who got caught)

So,here come me the crazy guy! If Shakky was actually in the same group as WB,Kaido,BM,Shiki,Captain John,Silver Axe and Quan Xi and also considered a threat from Garp to be chased by him, could she be the lurking legend or having an appearance in wano?Since BM and Kaido joined forces?i would like to see what ppl think about shakky in this thread.

fl0l4k,Alpha_ii_Omega,Dorry and Brogy adjusted bounty is $2.22 Billion each,"One interesting thing I saw is that Dorry and Brogy both seemed to use a variation of the spear of Elbaf, which Oda himself said is ""the strongest spear of Elbaf"". You can draw your own conclusions when deciding if Big Mom factors into that or not. 

They also were pretty clearly using haki in retrospect. Even though people try to disagree with this, it's pretty obvious that giving them the ""New World Treatment"" would see them have haki. 

And of course the most interesting point is their $100 million bounty. This might not seem impressive, considering Luffy already had a $300 million bounty by Sabaody. However, their bounty was 100 years old. If the One Piece world has an annual inflation rate of 3.15%, which there is no reason to assume it doesn't, then Dorry and Brogy's modern day bounty would be $2.22 Billion each.

I actually think this might be a clever way of Oda foreshadowing their true power level, without actually telling us directly.",32,1584578113,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fl0l4k/dorry_and_brogy_adjusted_bounty_is_222_billion/,OnePiece,2

fl0bup,Carlos1502,So about Ryuma...,"SPOILERS OF EARLY WANO AND [MONSTERS](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Monsters):

I started One Piece with the anime and I've never read the chapters before the time-skip so back in december during that 3 week drought we get every year I started the series from the begining. I've especially been trying to pay attention to everything that could be some kind of foreshadowing in order to develop my own theories about future chapters. Now I'm at Thriller Bark and I think I found something interesting about Ryuma.

Ryuma is in reality a character from a one-shot Oda wrote in 1994. This short story seems to be cannon as Oda confirmed in [volume 47 SBS](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/SBS_Volume_47#Chapter_457.2C_Page_166). It depicts how Ryuma killed a dragon but the place where this story happens is clearly not Wano, in fact Ryuma says himself that he is an outsider. The fact that Ryuma got out from Wano actually makes sense as he is a worldwide renown legend and if wano was as isolated as it seems to be he wouldn't have been so famous.

Ryuma leaving Wano makes the theory about Zoro actually being a gran-grand-grand...son of Ryuma a bit more plausible.

This also confirms the existance of dragons in the One Piece world, not just artificial ones, which also makes a bit more plausible the theory of Kaido being an actual dragon.

I haven't found anything about this in the subreddit so I thought you may like it.

And also, this certainly means nothing but the village where Ryuma kills the dragon is very similar to Banaro Island (where Ace and Blackbeard fought).",29,1584577116,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fl0bup/so_about_ryuma/,OnePiece,7

She would be the daughter of the King of the Pirates and the Warlord ""Pirate Empress""

Seeing that Orochi, (an exiled Korozumi) came up through the ranks under Shimotsuki Yasuie, got me thinking if their is a connection between the two families.

We know there were a few six clans in Wano, who they had a history of relationships between themsleves for generations. So possibly some members in the Shimotsuki clan may have always been close to Korozumi clan, to the extent of offering shelter and protection in secrecy after their attempted coup.

We know that the Korozumi clan was persecuted (""beaten, thrown into rivers or outright killed"" as put by Orochi). So, is it possible that an ally in the Shimotsuki sheltered some Korozumis eventually helping them escape and settle in Shimotsuki village in East blue?

IT IS I! **GOD ENERU**, here to use my 'Mantra' and predict the participants, and outcome, of this **incredible fight**!!!

Let's see.....ohhhh, looks like the Humans...and a few 'Monsters'...are going to show up soon; my my! This looks like ***quite*** the battle!

I would even call it...**A WAR OF THE YONKO**!!! Yahahahahahaha!

- **'Onigashima'** is the skull of the old '**continent-puller**', the **ancestor of Oars**, who is an **ancestor of Kaido**
- **Kaido** is an experiment of **Vegapunk**, who managed to extract the '**lineage factor**' of the '**Dragon**' from it's **Mythical Zoan fruit**, and **combine** it with the **lineage factor** of an **Oni**, amongst '**other things**' ... Vegapunk succeeded, but **Big Mom** rescued him from his fate, along with **Xebec**
- **Big Mom** is a failed experiment of **Vegapunk** also, an attempt at '**gigantification**' that failed, or so he thought, who was taken in by **Xebec**
- Luffy, Law, and Kidd will take the Samurai to the opposite port, where everyone is waiting...because Zunesha told Momonosuke the '**true plan**'!! They were ready for this defection!! **He knew it was Kanjuro all along!**
- **Marco** is there (he is in the latest chapter, bottom right of the double-spread in disguise)
- X-Drake, Hawkins, and Apoo will gather with Kaido and Big Mom...
- Kaido, his Clamaties, and his Hundred Beast pirates, his Worst Generation members, and Big Mom will be assembled
- **Zunesha will land**, carrying the Minks, Nekomamushi, Jimbe, the New Fishman Pirates, Bege, Bellamy, and **the Straw Hat Grand Fleet**
- The **Big Mom Pirates** will land, and join with **Big Mom**
- **Blackbeard** will arrive some point soon! I can't believe that **Monster** is going to be there!!! Oooooo, and he's bringing **Moriah** with him...whose heart seems **filled with anger** and **revenge**...this battle will **not end well for him**

- At some point, **Zoro will use 'Asura' during this War**, probably to deal the final blow to Kaido
- At some point, **Sanji will use 'Hell Memories' during this War**, probably to deal the final 'blow' to Big Mom

Well, that's all for now...who knows!! Maybe a particular **Monkey** will make it harder for my Mantra to be accurate...in any case, this coming **Yonko War** is going to make the **Whitebeard War** look absolutely cute!!! I can't wait!!!

fkv8b9,Onianexiaz,A late night theory about bullets and Ryou,"A lotta people have theorised that gun users like Beckmann Yasopp and Van Augur use Hardening on their bullets to make them viable but can a hardened bullet really damage any good haki user,can it even retain the hardening. This brings me to flowing haki the very purpose of this haki is expulsion so it can probably remain ok much longer without direct contact with user. if a gun user uses it he may create something like explosive bullet that damage logias, top users may even use Advanced Armament so that even if the bullet doesn't pierce the skin, haki will enter your body and damage your internals. Ofcourse this raises the difficulty of being gun user in the New World exponentially since you would have to have both future sight and master Advanced Armament to actually be a threat to bigshots but on the flipside it explains why guys like Beckmann Yasopp and Van Augur are such hyped characters.",5,1584558801,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fkv8b9/a_late_night_theory_about_bullets_and_ryou/,OnePiece,1

fkuv3m,Onianexiaz,Why Usopp would fight the traitor and other parallels,"We knew that the Scabbards were meant to parallel Oden but now with the true nature of every Scabbard revealed I believe we can draw a somewhat clearer comparison
Luffy =Oden (apparent)

Zoro =Denjiro (bowed to their enemy for their leaders sake)

Sanji =Ashura (initially reluctant but became part of family)

Jinbe=kawamatsu (Fishman, mature)

Usopp =Kanjuro (liars, hide/don't realise their true strength)

Brook =Inurashi(European fighting style)

Franky =Kinemon(goofy, rebel past)

Carrot(maybe) =Nekomamushi (easygoing, heavily affected by loss of close one) 


Nami =Shinobu(worked for enemy) 

Robin=Raizo/Kiku(not as apparent) 


Now going back to my original statement I believe each of the strawhats or atleast Luffy Zoro Sanji Usopp Carrot(debatable if strawhat but will surpass neko/inu) would surpass their parallel scabbard/Oden especially Zoro who may do a double Jump and even surpass Oden. And for this Oda has laid clear path and this includes Usopp vs Kanjuro 

While everyone wants a scabbard to beat Kanjuro for emotional impact imo the samurai are still not as adapted to fighting unique devil fruits and its no exaggeration that just in terms of pure possibilities Kanjuro has the strongest. Now which strawhat has a consistent record of defeating hax df users Usopp Kanjuro would continue the theme of a seemingly unbeatable df being beat by Usopps strategy and luck while compared to Perona and Sugar Kanjuro would be an actual challenge strength wise also forcing Usopp to properly learn Observation /Armament or both.

fkuc7u,Cartoon_Star,Kinemon's power,"So far Kinemon's very specific abilities, prominently his DF and ability to cut fire have shown some sort of (major) significance for the respective arcs he appeared in. Especially his  **Kitsunebi-ryu**  = Fox-Fire style is too special and unique to be left unexplained.

\-He is one of the strongest samurai of Wano and a great swordmaster. He was able to cut the steel doors on punk hazard with ease and was essential to defeat Smiley (by setting it on fire) and cutting the subsequent explosion (we have not seen his Fox-Fire-Style since, with the exception of the Oden flashback).

\-On Dressrosa his DF, the Fuku Fuku no mi, allowed him to pose as Doflamingo and infiltrate the palace (on top of helping the Strawhats to disguise themselves prior to that)

I picked those 2 scenes to point two things:

1)while he is clearly not as strong as the strongest fighters on the alliance currently, he can hold his own against strong opponents, we have never really seen him go full out, I would imagine his passion to Wano and Oden is another boost to his already great power. And again, his ability to cut with and cut through fire is oddly specific for a ""regular"" human. I would be a little disappointed if Oda never came out and explained how he is able to do this (or why only he is doing it).

\-&gt; I think that this ability will have some significance to it in the battle to come. I am just picturing this epic double spread page, Kinemon with a dead serious face, cutting his way out of a ring of fire and right through his opponent saying something like ""Don't underestimate the samurai of Wano Kuni, protector of the Kozuki family. And there is a reason they call me Foxfire Kinemon!""

&amp;#x200B;

2) Again, a common trope for plot-twists is subverting expectations, like having a seemingly useless DF be super relevant or hard to deal with. While I am not as sure about how Oda can pull this off, but I really hope and see potential to have Kinemon's fruit play a role in this arc again, other than providing adequate attire for the Strawhats.After all, Wano seems to be the arc of betrayals and infiltration, his power suits this very well, paralleling the events of Dressrosa.

\-&gt; I hope Kinemon or his alliance will find a way to use his devil fruit for their advantage, maybe by infiltrating Kaido's or Orochi's forces by disguising themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: Kinemon as a character, through his abilities and history bears so much significance to the story and has yet to take the spotlight. He has been travelling with us since the very beginning of the New World, it is time for the new ""hour of legend""!",18,1584555729,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fkuc7u/kinemons_power/,OnePiece,2

fktps1,Babeko,Ice Hunter arc,"Ice Hunter arc is so underrared. It's not as good as G8 arc but the arc have a lot cool moment. The fight scene is good and funny. Sanji and Usopp vs the married couple is hillarious. Franky and Nami vs that hockey guy is also good and of cource, Luffy vs Accino. The villains have cool power and character designs. The magnet twin power is so creative. Accino with the proto-Oven-DF is also great.

I really though that the antagonist fit so well with the canon. They are so fun too. Turns out, Oda designed them himself. Toei seems to put a lot of thought into this. They even include Accino family in the opening song.

The only downside to this arc is Phoenix Pirates. Their design is so plain. So when compared to SH and Accino Family, they are so lackluster and stuck out like a sore thumb. Their background and history is good but they can do without the Pirate King thing. I just can't seem to sympatize with their dream because I know that it won't happen because they are filler. So instead of uplifting, I felt even more sorry for them.

The setup is also great. It got my attention but as soon as the SH enters Lovely Land. The arc got worse. But still, I really like this ar  for the awesome moment. Like how the SH paniced when they missed their Flag and afraid of being scolded by Luffy. It also acts like a buffer.

fkt0nm,KillaKast16,Marine invasion will definitely happen in Wano,"https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/cwqydh/zoros_character_development_in_wano_and_how_kuina/

So I definitely believe this theory linked above has a lot of weight to it, and my theory is expounding on the reveal of how Kuina was murdered.

### Remember - Wano is Zoro's time to grow
With that being said, there is no greater character development for him to undergo than to face the very emotions of Kuina's death. Feel free to look into that theory, but I believe it is very likely that her death is not random, this is Oda we are talking about guys.

### But where does Marine Invasion tie into this?
Well I've read another theory in regards to how there is a historical event with marines invading, and I can't find the link but I think with how Oda likes to reference historical events it makes it more likely. **But in regards to Zoro's development, a marine invasion is critical**

### Why is marine invasion needed?
There happens to be a marine who looks exactly like Kuina. She will be part of the crew that arrives at Wano, whether it was random chance, or she jumped at the chance to sign-up for this mission because of her love of swords style and Wano's history. She will be arriving at Wano, and she will cause the murderer of Kuina, who will be a strong swordsman, to remember how he killed a little girl that looks like her. **Thus, Zoro find out the truth, and grows in ways we will not be able to predict**",15,1584551258,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fkt0nm/marine_invasion_will_definitely_happen_in_wano/,OnePiece,1

fkstnx,JagIsa,What does Dragon actually know.?,"New to making posts here, sorry in advance. These here are just some questions I‚Äôve had that everyone could discuss if they are appropriate questions.

From the recent chapters Oden spoils to Toki that if she was jumping ahead of time for a reason then she needed to just jump 20 years more. Roger states that he is 20 years too early upon finding One Piece and learning the truth.? 

This is huge information stating we almost certainly now know that a big war is coming and maybe 800 years ago it was prophesied.? 

My questions regard Dragon. 

Do you believe Dragon knows about Imu.? Or the true nature of the WG.?

Does Dragon at least know some information about the OP.? Do you think he knows about Joy Boy.?

Was he always preparing for the upcoming war.? Did he know of it.? Is that why the revolutionaries are  making their moves now.?

Most of this would be of irrelevance but during the time skip we know that our archeologist Robin stayed with Dragon, so it begs to question that they both know/learned a lot of knowledge during that time.

1. The [Fuku a Fuku no Mi](https://v93.mangabeast.com/manga/One-Piece-Digital-Colored-Comics/0663-011.png): This fruit was consumed by Kinemon, and it can be reasonably assumed based on the language he uses (claims to have eaten it a long time ago) that ate it in Wano.

2. [Kanjuro‚Äôs currently unnamed Devil Fruit](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/1/13/Kanjuro%27s_Devil_Fruit.png/revision/latest?cb=20200316115442): He received this power before Wano was taken over by Kaido

3. [The Juku Juku no Mi](https://v1.mangabeast01.com/manga/One-Piece/0924-009.png): This fruit is debatable, since we aren‚Äôt sure when she ate it, but since Kaido focuses on Zoan type fruits, and Devil Fruits are quite a commodity that wouldn‚Äôt just be misplaced, that it is a Wano fruit.

4. The [Hebi Hebi no Mi: Model Yamata no Orochi](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/3/3e/Hebi_Hebi_no_Mi%2C_Model_Yamata_no_Orochi_Infobox.png/revision/latest?cb=20191217060910): We see Orochi receiving this fruit from the old folks.

5. The [Bari Bari no Mi](https://v93.mangabeast.com/manga/One-Piece/0969-004.png): We see Kurozumi Semimaru use this ability, and it‚Äôs highly likely he had this fruit when he met Orochi for the first time because...

And I believe that‚Äôs every fruit that is likely from Wano. While it‚Äôs possible other abilities, such as the Beast Pirate Zoan users, are from Wano, we lack proper evidence for those claims.

fkr7uh,Batbadet,Chapter 653 had so many foreshadowings,"I wanted to restart Punk-hazard for its relevancy to Wano, and decided to start just one chapter before in order to have a better introduction to it. So there I was reading the last chapter of Fishmen Island and so many things have brand new meanings now, they were probably theorized back then already, but I though a reminder couldn't hurt:

\-first just a reminder that Luffy will eventually destroy the Island but still relevant to the future, even now.

\-Then, again not so relevant but still an amazing foreshadowing at the time: the hint about the tamatebako's explosion

\-Now something that seems very important, but have not yet been relevant, the new log-pose. It has only been used for the way to punk hazard to this day, although I am sure the details with which it was introduced must mean it will have an impact in the future.

\-Then we have the fishmen's generals telling Luffy they will gather the strongest army in the all Ocean, and Luffy answers he cannot wait to see it.

fkr62x,Batbadet,just re-read chapter 653 and there are some many important foreshadowings in it.,"I wanted to restart Punk-hazard for its relevancy to Wano, and decided to start just one chapter before in order to have a better introduction to it. So there I was reading the last chapter of Fishmen Island and so many things have brand new meanings now, they were probably theorized back then already, but I though a reminder couldn't hurt: 

\-first just a reminder that Luffy will eventually destroy the Island but still relevant to the future, even now.

\-Then, again not so relevant but still an amazing foreshadowing at the time: the hint about the tamatebako's explosion

\-Now something that seems very important, but have not yet been relevant, the new log-pose. It has only been used for the way to punk hazard to this day, although I am sure the details with which it was introduced must mean it will have an impact in the future. 

\-Then we have the fishmen's generals telling Luffy they will gather the strongest army in the all Ocean, and Luffy answers he cannot wait to see it. As it is different from the one Jimbei is leading, I feel this particular army is never mentioned in theories, although it appears that it might be crucial in terms of power. Which is emphasized later by the king ""I won't forget this kindness"".

fkpx6l,JamesJokerDW3,"Carrot, Usopp, and Chopper will defeat Perospero","Since the beginning of One Piece, what kind of enemies has defeated Usopp? Enemies with abilities that weren't close-ranged. Jango, Chew, for instance. Enemies with strange devil fruits: Perona; Sugar; and Miss Merry Christmas. And when he had to fight close-ranged enemies, like in Alabasta with Mr. 4, who fought with him? Chopper. I'm not gonna talk about Daruma, because he barely was an enemy for Usopp.

Then, what enemy do we have in Wano with a strange ability, truly diverse, versatile and not very close-ranged? Perospero. His ability seems more like support, rather than direct fight. Like a sniper.

Usopp deserves a real fight already; he's about to face his father, and he can't do that just having defeated Daruma and (so to speak) Sugar. He needs this. Obviously, a man with a bounty of  700.000.000 bellies, is too much for just Usopp. Who's going to fight with him then? First, Carrot.

Carrot, for obvious reasons, is gonna be there fighting Perospero. Pedro died trying to kill him and failed, so Carrot will have his revenge. But what happens, Usopp and Carrot barely know each other; they haven't been together long, so it would be kind of strange to have them fighting together, like rushed and unrealistic. Who is very fond of both of them, and have fought alongside both of them? Chopper.

Chopper and Carrot have a great relationship and made a nice combo during WCI. Chopper and Usopp have fought together many times, and their relationship has been one of the closest relationships in the crew. So Chopper is important as he'll be the bond between Usopp and Carrot, he'll join them together.

I think these three are enough to defeat Perospero, and they can make an incredible fight. I expect some great thinking by Usopp and Chopper, like in Alabasta, but this time Carrot delivering the final blow.

In my opinion, they can pull it out and make it one of the greatest battles in Wano.

I thought about who Usopp can fight in Wano. None of the samurai. King, Queen or Jack? Too much. Any other of the Beast Pirates? That's too low. Smoothie? She uses a sword and her ability is close-ranged, and once again, I think she'd be too much. Then, when it comes to Charlotte's family, who else we got? Daifuku? He doesn't seem to be able to do anything but fight with his genie. Oven? Could be, as someone who keeps the distance can fight his heat, but I'd say Jinbe will defeat Oven.

fkofke,JeR_raH,Regarding Jinbe in Wano,"So.. I've been thinking about how Jinbe might return to the Straw Hats in Wano.

My speculation was that Jinbe will show up on the port just before the Pirate-Mink-Samurai-Ninja-Alliance leaves for the raid on Onigashima. But he did not, so I thought maybe he will chase after them to catch up before they'll arrive on Onigashima.
But because of Ch. 974 I figured: What if Jinbe joins the naval battle which will most likely take place next chapter(s)? He is obviously well suited for combat in/from the water and it could make a cool re-appearance.
It would be a good point in the story to get Jinbe tied directly into the Wano arc (at least imo). Possibly even bringing his former crew as reinforcement. Or they only took Jinbe to Wano and he will come alone, swimming to the battle.

Of course all this assumes that Jinbe did not die, is held prisoner or got taken care of otherwise by the Big Mom Pirates.

So what are your thoughts? (When) will Jinbe return to the Straw Hats? And where? And how?
Or do you think Jinbe sacrificed himself with Luffy's last words to him being: ""Even if you die, don't die!!!""",15,1584532993,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fkofke/regarding_jinbe_in_wano/,OnePiece,1

fknlr9,pice0fshit,The Great Era Of Piracy,"Roger, Rayleigh, Oden and Whitebeard knew about the One Piece and Ancient History.  


Rayleigh tells Robin that when they found out about it, they came to a conclusion. He also mentions that she might come to a different conclusion to theirs, but as things stand, she wont be able to do anything about it.  


From Rayleigh's story, we find out that Roger almost planned out his last words and started the Great Age of Piracy. Whitebeard continued his legacy by confirming the existence of One Piece and inspiring thousands more. Then we come to Oden. From his flashback, we know that Joyboy was destined to arrive at Wano 20 years later. The prophecy mentions this in with certainity. What this means is that Joyboy would have definitely arrived at Wano and later found the One Piece. So Roger didn't start the Great Age of Piracy to guide Joyboy to this journey.  


I think the conclusion mentioned by Rayleigh was when Joyboy arrives, he would need allies for the Great War. Which is why Oden was shown preparing for Joyboy's arrival in Wano. So the reason Roger started the Great Age of Piracy and Whitebeard started the next era has to do with creating an army of pirates. A huge naval army to oppose the Navy. The one who can head this army must be someone with the power to turn his enemies to allies, the deadliest power of the seas as remarked by Mihawk. And that person will become the 'King of Pirates'.",13,1584528421,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fknlr9/the_great_era_of_piracy/,OnePiece,1

I think this is possible since Lola might still think that Big Mom is kind hearted enough to listen to her, given how she believe Big Mom would actually help Nami in time of need just by vivre card. All it took is a newspaper stating Big Mom is chasing the Strawhats to Wano to find out about the situation.

Could this perhaps be why the cover story is stretching? To delay the reveal that another supernova is going to show up to Wano country.

I'm guessing since Momo is a child or trained as a samurai he adapted more easily. Chopper should feel inclined to 'treat' him and help him find balance with his body. I've wanted this since the Zou arc and im starting to worry it won't happen. I'm still hoping Momo gets ahold of his first rumble ball this battle to unlock a hybrid form. He is awkward in his dragon body but a more human hybrid might lend itself to the training he has taken in his human form and allow him to participate in the fight beyond giving luffy a ride and as he defeats kaido to symbolically take over as 'the dragon that rules over wano', and if the SHs leave him with a prescription of rumble balls he can follow chopper's footsteps, eventually permanently gaining new forms and just needing RBs to reach ultimate.",11,1584506586,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fkjvrn/i_really_want_momonoske_to_get_ahold_of_choppers/,OnePiece,1

fkj92i,unitaya,The timeline/pacing of One Piece is so weird if you think about it,"This definitely isn't an original thought that hasn't ever been discussed before but I have no IRL friends who watch/read One Piece (too long which I understand) but damn the timing is so weird.

1. The Strawhats were together as a crew for less than 1 year (I think someone said that from the time Luffy met Zoro to the 2 year time skip, maybe only 6 months have elapsed) 
   1. So essentially they were apart longer than they were together
2. Brooke was straight up ready to die for any of the Strawhats after 1 week as a member. Yes I understand that relationship dynamics are different in the OP universe but wow that's a short time
3. We meet Kinemon around episode 580 and we FINALLY get to Wano Country around episode 900 which means that almost half of the entire One Piece Universe has passed before we even started to get down to business with Kinemon's arc
4. Jinbei was essentially initiated as a Strawhat towards the end of Fishman Island right? So around episode 575 and we're at episode 922 right now, so like point 3, Jinbei was basically introduced as a Strawhat and hasn't been heard from in since half of the series

This is mostly my fault as I read the manga and I probably read it way too fast to actually absorb all of the information that was thrown at me, but the timing is just so odd logically (and yeah I shouldn't be throwing in logic in a universe where the main character is made of rubber and you can attach a head to a pair of legs and survive).

Because of Corona, I wanted to do a deep dive back into the universe and decided to start again at the Punk Hazard arc, and it feels pretty recent in terms of the in-universe timeline (probably only like, a month before the current the arc?), but I just checked and the first volume published about this arc was in 2013 which was s e v e n years ago. 

I'm not sure if I wanted this to be a discussion or an empty rant but I'm truly baffled at the concept of time flying by so fast in real life and then reading a chapter a week where the chapter essentially just spans like, 10 minutes of dialogue or 5 minutes of a fight.",32,1584503585,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fkj92i/the_timelinepacing_of_one_piece_is_so_weird_if/,OnePiece,1

fkhljo,makmugens,Are the World Nobles supposed to represent Israel?,"This has been a thought that‚Äôs been turning in my head for some time, but I noticed that there was striking correlations between things in One Piece and the real world.

For one, it seemed like the World Governments Marines was a symbol of the US- a political organization whose military presence extends around the world. 

Second, that they seem to protect a peculiarly small entity in the world that receives complete and unquestioned support from the US- which would be Israel. Much like Israel, the US has often said that it will come to the aid of Israel against any attacker. 

In One Piece, both the Marines and the Nobles are shown to be rotten groups in general- even though their may be a few people in it who have conflicting views, ultimately, they are still functioning under the Marines and supporting them and the Nobles. This seems to be the State of Israel (I‚Äôm not talking about a race here...)

Then I saw the Shichibukai who are basically government-sanctioned terrorists that the WG uses. They receive caste-Blanche support from the WG.

The Revolutionary Army is a group of people who have seen the truth of the government and Nobles and try to fight them. The WG names them all terrorists. 

This seemed to strong a comparison to dismiss, but I could be wrong...",19,1584496460,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fkhljo/are_the_world_nobles_supposed_to_represent_israel/,OnePiece,1

fkgjyc,Shanal9,I've figured out how far Luffy can stretch!,"As we all know, in the Volume 4 SBS, Oda stated that Luffy can stretch about 72 Gomu Gomus. Now, we all wondered what Gomu Gomu means in miters, yet when asked; Oda instead just gave as an entire unit system based off of several kinds of Gomu Gomus.

But **I** have managed to crack it down. Though there isn't an 100% accurate answer, so we'll measure it in a range of lowest to highest estimation!

In SBS Volume 8, Oda slipped a critical info surrounding Gomu Gomu;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h9v511h2tbn41.jpg?width=614&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dba38ca5762a9ad7bc80980bcfd20048819362a

As we can see here, 705 Poison Gomu Gomus mean 7050 Gomu Gomus, but we now know that it's also considered **COSMIC DISTANCE.** Now, the term Cosmic Distance in itself is very vague, so we'll chop it into low estimation, and high estimation.

**Lowest among super low estimatnion:** The very, very, very, VERY smallest distance that may apply to Cosmic stuff is most likely Earth's radius, which in itself is small as HELL compared to distance between our surface and the nearest man-made satellite. So, here it's **6371 KM.**

**Highish/Average Estimation:** Now, something like A.U would be faaar too crazy, so we'll go with the distance between Earth and the celestial body closest to us; Moon. This is about  **384,400 KM.**

Now, we don't know how much Luffy can stretch NOW, but it shouldn't be improved by that much because he can't really alter his fundamental body properties THAT much (G2, G3 and G4 are part of his body properties, albeit enhanced by Haki. And no, example of Zoro sprouting two extra frickin' heads and pair of arms doesn't count.)

But since Luffy was already trying to go for 100 Gomu Gomus, we'll give him benefit of doubt, and say he can finally reach that distance. So-

**Low Estimate of Luffy's Stretching Distance:** 90 Kilometers!!!

**High Estimate of Luffy's Stretching Distance:**  5452 Kilometers!!!!!!!!!!

**Conclusion:** Luffy might just be able to reach Raftel by stretching alone.

You will (and did) call me a **'genius'**, then a **'second Oda'**, then a **'troublemaker**, and then ***insane, crazy, and childish***

If you want to know what One Piece is, you must go from being a **Human**, to a **God**...and then a **Bhudda**...and then realize what you are, and what One Piece is

***Only Oda can tell you what One Piece is, in a way that you will believe it***

***Every single panel, every line of dialogue, every island, every Arc, every key clue, and every single fact and mechanic Oda has shown us, is LINKED***

Once you find the meaning of Freedom, you will become **like Kami**...and your *Mantra* will not encompass, just **one Island**, but the ***Whole World***...

Wondered why Wano feels like the *best Arc so far*... ?

Wondered why we *feel like we're getting so many answers and clues lately*... ?

Wondered why Oda thought it would take **5** years to write, and why it has been **20**... ?

...and why he says it will **take only 5 more**... ?

For the same reason he told you this:

***Marineford will look cute compared to what's coming***

Take every single word Oda has ever said about One Piece, every single 'fact' you have, and hold every single arc in your mind at once.

Does Oda ever **forget a character**?

Does Oda ever **give useless information**?

Does Oda ever fail to **explain *everything***?

The reason no-one has figured it out yet, is because **none of you are thinking like Luffy does** yet. You must think of **nothing**, and yet **everything**

Like so: 

Luffy, Law, and Kidd, will land on Onigashima. This is the start of the Final Great War. Marineford, or the 'Whitebeard War', will be nothing compared to the 'War of the Yonko' that is about to start:

- Borsalino
- Sakazuki
- Lucci, Kaku, and CP0
- Zoro and Killer
- Blackbeard
- Kuzan
- Kaido
- Big Mom
- Shiki
- Xebec
- Luffy, Law, and Kidd
- X-Drake, Apoo, and Hawkins
- Shirahoshi, and Momonosuke
- Jimbe and Wadatsumi
- Zunesha, with the Minks
- The Straw Hat Grand Fleet
- Bellamy and the Hyena pirates
- The old retainers of Oden
- Kyoshiro, Hyogoro, and the Yakuza
- Coby, with Hancock
- Shanks, with the red-haired pirates
- Mihawk
- The 'Oni' of Wano
- Buggy the Clown and his crew
- Vinsmoke Judge and GERMA-66

- **Enel**

And we will see:

- Pluton
- Poseidon
- Uranus

I apologize...as when I first 'pieced together the puzzle', I got *UNIMAGINEABLY* kind, supportive, and encouraging comments, which pushed me on and on, to get to the end of the line. The more I 'figured it out', the crazier I sounded, and I almost became like Kami....power corrupts, but **absolute power corrupts absolutely**. I am a **Human**, the same as **Oda**, and the same as **You**

I am going to be the 'Whitebeard' of this Arc, of this post, and of this ***wonderful, fantastic, beautiful, sad, amazing, tragic, unwavering, consistent*** and ***Divine*** story that we all hold so close to our hearts:

***ONE PIECE!!! DOES EXIST!!!***

Peace, love, and enjoy the Beginning of the End.

P.S: If anyone believes me, I'll answer ANY question you have about One Piece, but I will *try* to answer it by pointing to the things **right in front of our faces** that have been **telling us all along**, because I now realize the sheer responsibility that comes from knowing ***One Piece***...

It seems so crazy to me to see these three back together again, though I know for a lot of you it has felt a lot longer than it has for me.  I love the difference in expressions between then and now. Back then, Luffy was so much more serious because he had just saw Camie being treated like a piece of property in the auction house while Law and Kidd had just watched this crazy rubber kid punch a Celestial Dragon in the face. Now Kidd and Law have both had to deal with everything that's happened to their crews in Wano while Luffy has just had the time of his life training and kicking ass, and he's probably riding the ocean's biggest adrenaline high.

What are you all expecting out of this team up?

If you submit without a flair, the bot will send you a reminder message, and remove the post until a flair is selected. 

Some versions of reddit already have forced flair enabled. Others can't be configured to force flairs. Those should now be fixed by this bot. 

You may not know, until now us mods have been responsible for fixing unflaired posts *manually*. It's long overdue that we modernize. 

---

Because of this change, rule 12 is being updated: 

* Old ""Flair your posts if required"" 
* New ""Flair your posts correctly"" 

We already had a report option for wrong flair, but it was discouraged, since rule 12 was previously a guideline. Now if someone has the wrong flair please report it. Every little bit helps. These won't be removed, just fixed by a mod. 

[Here is the list of flairs and what they are for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/flair) 
* The most incorrectly used flair is [Analysis], which is for facts, observations, details and data, not theory or opinion. 
* The second most incorrect is [Media]/[Fanart], which are often mixed up, since Fanart should only be drawings or (rarely) 3-d renders. 
* [Discussion] and [Theory] are often mixed up, but this does not matter at all, because the overlap is huge. They can be ignored. 

[The full text for rule 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/rules) has been updated accordingly.

Welcome one, welcome all, we're glad to have you! If you're new to Bets and Bravery, B&amp;B is a weekly thread on this subreddit where users bet with fake currency, the Beli from in-universe, on what they think will happen in each week's chapter in a series of bets made by yours truly. I keep track of everyone's money in a giant Google Sheet, which is available in the links above. So, if you're new, enjoy your time! But, if you're a regular on this thread, we're glad to see you back at r/OnePiece's unofficial official pasttime!

I hope you've all had a good week so far with whatever's been happening in your lives. If you haven't had such a good week so far, I'm wishing the best for you and hope I can brighten your day even a little bit with this post.

Before we get started, let's refresh your memory of last chapter to get you back on betting track!

##Last Time on One Piece

So, let's talk about that chapter.

After roughly 5 years of waiting, Oda finally reveals what we suspected all along: ~~Bariete was the traitor~~ someone was a mole for Orochi and Kaido all along. In the most dramatic twist reveal since Shuten-maru turned out to be Ashura Douji, Kanjuro admits to his fellow Scabbards that he was the traitor all along. As an unfairly persecuted member of the Kurozumi Clan, the artist merely sought a place to die and was granted that wish by Orochi, who used him to gather info on the Kozuki. Kin'emon cuts down what turns out to be a drawing of Kanjuro, who is actually artistically competent ~~and even more evil for creating Nekozaemon and Rising Dragon Ryuunosuke in such a sadistic manner~~ before he grabs Momo to bring him to Orochi. In spite of his flawless plan of revealing himself to be a traitor before 6 highly skilled samurai and without securing a route to Onigashima himself first, Kanjuro is surprised to find that the main character of the story showed up to help his nakama after being absent from his own story for 15 chapters. Luffy, Law, and Kid arrive on the scene to fight off Kanjuro's Beasts Pirates ambush, and with this, it seems as though we're finally about to start the Wano War.

To everyone who properly guessed Kanjuro's status as the traitor (or even further, his being of Kurozumi lineage), congratulations. To everyone else who didn't ~~lmao, imagine being that stupid~~ there's always next time!

With that out of the way, let's get into the real meat of the thread.

#Chapter 975 Betting

##The Bets of the Week

###Bet 370

With Shinobu out of action at Kanjuro's hands, the proper heir to the Wano Country, Kozuki Momonosuke, is in a bit of a pickle. Captured by the traitor to the Scabbards and in the clutches of one of Orochi's loyal vassals, Momonosuke is to be transported to Onigashima and delivered to the Shogun personally. At the same time, this will probably be the first time since leaping through time that Momonosuke will come face to face with both his father's mortal enemies: the enemy of the Kozuki, Kurozumi Orochi, and the man responsible for Wano's decline, the Yonkou Kaido. 

After 20 years of waiting, Kaido's seemingly got questions for the living Scabbards, but I imagine he'll be even more interested in Oden's child ~~oh fuck that sounded better in my head~~. At the same time, all Orochi has to do is kill Momonosuke to, what he thinks, eliminate all possible claims to the throne of Wano other than himself. Of course, all this speculation rides on one crucial thing: whether or not Momonosuke is transported to Onigashima in the clutches of the enemy. Dear audience, for the first bet in a while, let's have some fun! Will Momonosuke be transported to Onigashima by Orochi's forces?

* A. Momo will be taken to Onigashima personally by Kanjuro (includes methods involving his Devil Fruit)! Odds 1:2

* B. Momo will be taken to Onigashima by other members of Orochi's forces! Odds 1:4

* C. Momo will be rescued by members of the Alliance in the ensuing battle at Port Tokage! Odds 1:3

* D. Momo will be rescued somehow else by members of the Alliance! Odds 1:4

###Bet 371

Born in a theatre troupe where he would lose his parents due to lynch mob persecution of his family, a young Kurozumi Kanjuro was approached by a then-scheming Orochi with a deal in hand: spy on the Kozuki Clan, feed Orochi information, and vengeance against the people of Wano responsible for his family's death will be granted. With a Devil Fruit in hand, a role to play, and searching for a place to die, Kanjuro was recruited by Oden as a retainer, where he joined forces with 8 other samurai to become one of the Nine Red Scabbards.

After living alongside his allies in both sickness and in health, through good times and bad, through a long and weathered history from the past t----resent ~~anyone feel like we just skipped something important?~~ Kanjuro continued to spy on his allies all the while up until revealing himself on the night of the present Fire Festival. He claims he meant the Scabbards no harm and that he was wholeheartedly prepared to die alongside them and Oden, but was that all an act too? Shonen manga is no stranger to the enemy-turned-ally character trope, but has Kanjuro taken things too far to where redemption is no longer possible? It still feels like there's more to his story than we currently know as, even now, he's still sorely underdeveloped for how long he's been a part of the main cast. Has Kanjuro crossed the point of no return? Will Kanjuro be forgiven? Will he redeem himself?

* A. Kanjuro will remain loyal to Orochi and is not worthy of forgiveness! Odds 1:4

* B. Kanjuro will be forgiven but will remain loyal to Orochi first! Odds 1:3

* C. Kanjuro will attempt to rejoin the Alliance but won't be forgiven! Odds 1:5

* D. Kanjuro will be forgiven and will rejoin the Alliance! Odds 1:2

###Bet 372

It's time for everyone's favorite bet preceding a chapter with a fight. After a good long while of flashback where we knew most of the outcomes to major battles, we have one battle that *could definitely go any way!*

Place your bets, who will win the battle at Port Tokage?

* A. The Alliance! Odds 1:1.5

* B. The Beasts Pirates! Odds 1:4

* C. Big Mom outta nowhere! Odds 1:30

* D. The battle will end in a draw! Odds 1:10

###Bet 373

This bet is where you can bet how many pages Chapter 975 will feature!

**Note:** Shounen Jump covers, fan art pages, or translator note pages from either Jaimini's Box or Mangastream are not counted here. Double page spreads are counted as two separate pages. Color pages and color spreads are counted. Cover story serials and fan-requested cover pages are counted.

* A. 16 or less pages! Odds 1:15

* B. 17 pages! Odds 1:1.3

* C. 18 or more pages! Odds 1:10

###Bet 374

Our final bet this week is about the main focus of this week's chapter! The chapter may cover multiple storylines, in which case, the correct answer will be whichever storyline the chapter gave the most attention to in terms of pages or panels, should it get that close!

* A. The battle at Port Tokage! Odds 1:2

* B. The Alliance elsewhere in Wano! Odds 1:3

* C. Other storylines, such as Denjiro, Kaido and Orochi, Big Mom, or something else outside of Wano! Odds 1:5

##Weekly Mini-Game

It's only fair that the man at the center of last week's central conflict as well as many of the major conflicts of the past few hundred chapters, Kanjuro, gets a special focus during this week's mini-game! Dear audience, I want you to guess in how many panels the Kozuki traitor will appear in Chapter 975!

* **Criteria for WMG:** Kurozumi Kanjuro appears in person in a panel in Chapter 975.

* **Note:** Kanjuro has to appear in person in a panel. Panels that only mention Kanjuro by name, a recognizable epithet, or show him in a thought bubble do not count toward the total. Panels featuring ink clones only count if we're unable to discern whether or not it's the real body (basically if the cast thinks it's really Kanjuro, we're right there along with them unless told otherwise). Panels that make up scene transitions are subject to these same rules and are counted separately.

Guess 100% correctly on this, and you'll receive a whopping 1,500,000 Beli! If nobody guesses correctly, the closest answer receives 750,000 Beli! If multiple people guess correctly or are evenly close to the correct answer, the bounty is evenly split among them to the nearest 1,000 Beli!

fka9nk,thethreetrueandy,New character(s) introduction theory,"With Wano drawing closer to the final battle, i'm still trying to wrap my head around how Luffy and friends will defeat Kaido and his new allies the BMP. I know mostly all of Luffy's allies has received some kind of training to make them stronger but even combined I feel like they would still be no match for their monstrous opponents. Even with the possibility of other allies showing up like Jimbe or Luffy's grand fleet it's still not adding up. Which is why I believe Oda will soon introduce a new character so strong they could take on Kaido and Big Mom at the same time. 

Although the possibilities are endless I think it will be somebody from the WG. At first I thought maybe the BBP but I think even Blackbeard isnt stupid enough to take on two Yankos just yet. The same goes for Shanks as well as the rest of the Warlords as they have their own problems they are currently dealing with. Which leaves the WG who have already sent in people from both the marines and CP to gather intel to see how bad the situation is. 

(My 3 predictions)

Green Bull - His character introduction is long over due and if what Doffy said is true I believe he could take on both Kaido and BM.

CP leader - Whats bothered me for a long time is that Oda has listed every rank for the Marines but has given little to nothing when it comes to CP. I know they have nine factions and 1 elite faction zero being the most secret and deadliest receiving direct orders from the WN. I know Kong and the Gorosei both lead the Marines and CP. However Akainu is third in command for the Marines so who's third in command that leads CP 1-9??? I believe this is another character Oda could introduce that could take on both Kaido and BM.

Vegapunks gen two pacifista - Its been a while since we've seen a pacifista in OP, with the first gens being mainly used for low tier pirates now. I think Vegapunk will unveil a new more sleeker and stronger pacifista, made specifically to take on high tier pirates(possibly even Yankos).",11,1584469548,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fka9nk/new_characters_introduction_theory/,OnePiece,1

fka3j4,BonGatsu,Sanji And Luffy Have The Same Dream.,"First of all, NO Sanji dosen't want to be the King of Pirates.

To understand Sanji's goal, we have to realize Sanji is already one of if not the best Chef. That's why Oda never wrote dialogues for the Strawhats to mention improvements in Sanji's cooking. His foods are great since day 1. The only thing we read is how much theh miss his food after a temporary separation. 

Then what does finding All Blue really means to Sanji if not to improve his already perfect cooking skills. 

Sanji set his goal during his tragic childhood. Cooking means the world to him as it represents originality and creativity. The two elements that his brothers lack since the day they were born. MORE IMPORTANTLY. THOSE TWO ELEMENTS MEANS FREEDOM. And that's all he wants, to be free from all the bullying and sorrows he experienced in Germa.

Now here comes the spicy part. Why All Blue? So a Chef can cook whatever he wants to. All Blue is the ultimate embodiment of freedom for a Chef.

So finding All Blue is not the end goal for Sanji, his goal is to be the FREEST CHEF. Much like our beloved captain Luffy, by becoming the Pirate King, they are both chasing that INTANGIBLE FREEDOM.",12,1584468989,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fka3j4/sanji_and_luffy_have_the_same_dream/,OnePiece,1

* I really feel that Katakuri is going to show up. Maybe Bruleee will transport him to Onigashima via the mirrors in order to help BM? But he turns on Big Mom and sides with Luffy and this would lead to a fight against King?

King vs Sanji

* Latest anime episode somewhat teased it and even if we ignore King's filler Diable Jumble, this fight is really interesting because both can fly and both are affiliated with fire.

King vs Marco

* The flames of healing vs the flames of destruction! Maybe Marco changed his mind and decided to follow Nekomamushi to Wano? And he could end up fighting King.

King vs Zoro

* The moment King was introduced everyone including me knew he was going to end up being Zoro's opponent. But since Zoro now has Enma, a blade that can cut Kaido, it doesn't make sense for Zoro to fight King unless it's some sort of a ""warm up"" match.

1. Luffy (Obviously)
2. Jinbe (At this point I believe Jinbe is still stronger than Zoro and Sanji, however he is older with less room for improvement, so I deffinitly believe Zoro and Sanji will have overtaken him by the end of the series)
3. Zoro (Functions as the vice captain, his only role is a fighter, slightly stronger than Sanji imo)
4. Sanji (His role is not just as a fighter, personally I like him more than Zoro so this is not bias)
5. Franky (He has shown the most, and with his improved body, general Franky and high durability, I believe he deserves the number five spot, despite the difference between him and number four being quite large)
6. Robin (She is seriously slept on. Her powers are insane, and people underestimate how much her giant limbs help her in the strenght department. She is a skilled fighter both close and far away, however she desperately needs haki)
7. Brook (Number 5, 6 and 7 are really up in the air imo, however Brook just doesn't have the insane durability of Franky, or the camping abilities of Robin)
8. Chopper (I've seen a lot of people overestimate Chopper. People tend to forget that monster point only lasts 3 minutes, and that form is quite slow, meaning an enemy can easily camp it out for the duration of the Rumble Ball. His other forms are still neat however they can not compare with anyone above him on the list)
9. Nami (She would have been number 10 had it not been for her WCI upgrade)
10. Usopp (He is a fantastic sniper, and my personal favorite character as well, however in close combat he can't do as much as everyone else.

fk8okc,ishawn04,Maybe Luffy already awaken his devil fruit just don't know yet,"#SIMILARITIES

So there are 2 paramecia type user who already awaken their devil fruit.
It's doflamingo and katakuri 
And lets see what they both have in common in terms of devil fruit consumption because I think it's matters 

1.Both got their fruits when they were young (idk think it's confirmed that katakuri got his at young age but it's makes sense being one of the eldest son and better than most of his brother and sister, that's why may be big mom gave him fruit early, being emperor and all)

2. Excessive use of their devil fruit. Both of those used their devil fruit since they where child but doflamingo were better in terms of fruit using because he can control other people by controlling their moter nerves in spine and that shit is hard af if you think about it. And katakuri well he is also uses his devil fruit above average of you look at his fighting style even if he use his haki mainly.


#SIMILARITIES LUFFY HAVE 

And now why Luffy might've already awaken his devil fruit because he also fits in these criteria 
He got his fruit at early age ‚úì
He use his fruit excessively ‚úì like he said he trained for 8 or something year to perfect his gum gum pistol (can't remember the exact number)
And now we have our facts I can prove he already uses his ability



#DETAILS HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT

So you guys remember 2nd or 3nd episode of one piece? Where shanks saved Luffy from that seaking? I think literally everyone of us thought he saved him with the power of friendship or some other bullshit (lol that's why I didn't like this at start)
But later revealed it was haki, like wtf? 
And Luffy previously used haki even without knowing it and maybe you guys don't even realized that either 
Like think when did Luffy used observation haki? 
Well maybe it was enis lobby arc but that not true he used his observation haki first time against Mr. 3 when he made clones of himself and Luffy said it was luck. But nope it was haki and that damn oda we really don't appreciate him much. 
And same as advance observation haki he used that against hawkeye. 
And I'm not sure about conquer haki tho I think it way again that bull before sabaodi.

So now we know oda loves to hide these things in plain sight 
And couple of minutes ago I thought we at a manga and that's why it happened and oda utilizes that fact to make it goofy 
Like nami hitting Luffy like why can't nami use armament haki like we know their are various versions of haki like earlier stage, normal and advance. Maybe nami posses early  stage haki and every time she hits him she always Angry and that might work as catalyst and those sences are funny AF and I thought ""man this doesn't make sence, maybe oda knows this is a manga and that's why he just utilising that fact and plus no one question it because it's funny AF"" and I'm not sure about other members like sanji and Zoro when they hit Luffy but never angry with his like nami expect one time, not sure when tho. 


# MAIN REASON
Now to the main part why I think Luffy already awaken his devil fruit and it's related to gear 3rd.
I use to thought this is also a manga thing and oda did this so he can draw easily like imagine after gear 3rd end and Luffy still in his normal sized clothes, that will make things complex and really hard to draw and express the story 
So, when Luffy uses his gear 3rd he exhale all the air from his mouth ( well their can be medical explanation for that but let's talk about that later) and we knows he always little exhausted when he uses that thus over using devil fruit power. Now you might think he also use his devil fruit excessively during gear 2nd but he uses his body (if that's makes sence) during gear 2nd only his heart uses his devil fruit ability excessively and save itself from explode from that blood pressure. But during gear 3nd his one major part of body stretched like hand, legs or other Part. And this leads to using his power more that normal and in the end awaken his devil fruit and because he didn't master his ability yet that's why only his clothes affects.

well it's a long shot but still worth taking.",5,1584464247,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fk8okc/maybe_luffy_already_awaken_his_devil_fruit_just/,OnePiece,1
fk8l7c,YannickSD,How I think One Piece will end,"This is not a theory on what will happen in the final act, with the One Piece and Laugh Tale and all that. It‚Äôs a theory on what will happen to each character after the climax, like where they‚Äôll end up after the story ends.

# The Straw Hat Crew

**Luffy:** All my theories about the SH crew rely on Luffy dying in the end. I think One Piece mostly tells his story and that of the Straw Hats and if he doesn‚Äôt die they all stay together and their story doesn‚Äôt really end there. There have also been many hints throughout the series, as he‚Äôs been shortening his lifespan repeatedly.

**Zoro:** I think Zoro will take up a sort of Rayleigh role. He‚Äôll become the world‚Äôs best swordsman and after Luffy dies continue his journey alone. He will obviously still remain in contact with the other Straw Hats but he wouldn‚Äôt follow anyone other than Luffy and he isn‚Äôt necessarily cut out to be a captain.

**Usopp:** ‚ÄúThe weak don‚Äôt get to choose how they die.‚Äù Well, God Usopp won‚Äôt be weak by the end of the story and he will have chosen his end all the way back in Chapter 119. (See picture below). I don‚Äôt think he will die during the story though. Maybe he‚Äôll replace Heracles and look after the Boin Archipelago. That way his prophecy would come true and it wouldn‚Äôt be sad.

**Nami and Sanji:** While Oda doesn‚Äôt write much romance, I do think Sanji and Nami will end up together. Sanji will have found the All Blue by the end of One Piece but Nami‚Äôs dream is a bit more complicated. She wants to draw a map of the entire world. This means she‚Äôll have to travel the world and I think Sanji will be right by her side. Maybe they‚Äôll even start a family.

**Brook:** He‚Äôs the most obvious one I think. He‚Äôll reunite with Laboon and travel with him.

**Chopper:** His dream is to cure all diseases, which is pretty impossible but he‚Äôll do the best he can and open up a hospital and continue his researches. I could see him ending up with Milky (the reindeer mink).

**Franky:** Franky will go back to Water 7 and work there as a shipwright. He‚Äôll be known, just like his father Tom, as the man who built the Pirate King‚Äôs ship.

**Robin:** She‚Äôs the one I really don‚Äôt know, because just like Sanji she will have achieved her dream by the end of One Piece. Maybe she‚Äôll just join one of the other Straw Hats. I could see her and Zoro becoming roomies (or more).

**Jinbe:** Fishman Island will need all the protection it can get if Luffy falls, and who better than the Knight of the Sea? Whether the island is still on the bottom of the ocean or on the surface Jinbe will be there.

# The World Government and the Marines

The World Government will fall and the Marines will be reduced in numbers as a consequence.

**Aokiji** will be Fleet Admiral and his three Admirals will be:

1. **Coby**
2. **Fujitora**
3. **Smoker**

# The Yonkos

I believe all current Yonkos will fall and the four people who will rule the New World will be:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Trafalgar D. Law** will control Kaido‚Äôs current territory.
2. **Eustass Kid** will control Shanks‚Äô current territory.
3. **Marco the Phoenix** will control Blackbeard‚Äôs current territory.
4. **Charlotte Katakuri** (so the Charlotte family won‚Äôt actually fall)

fk7wnl,ProCasual,Kanjuro double agent crack pot theory.,"I have seen a bit of stuff saying that it‚Äôs obvious that kanjuro is a traitor and it is. But passed twist have always been more elaborate. Nami being a traitor, the water 7 cp9 reveals, the entire impel down saga. Where if you got the hints in hindsight it made a lot of sense but the hints were much smaller than the evidence against kanjuro as a traitor. 

But what if that wasn‚Äôt the reveal. What if oda is only using this a diversion from the real twist. That odens loyalty made kanjuro an actual scabbard. 

There is a little evidence for this but it‚Äôs flimsy so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm asking you smart fellows who know more than I a filthy casual is there instances that support of deny this crack pot theory I‚Äôm missing. 

Evidence so far 

- all that has to be done to remove the spark of rebellion is to kill momonosuke. The fact that he is alive as the rightful heir is what made him one of the three important pieces in doflamingos game outlined by Nami at the beginning of dressrosa. The important pieces were Caesar for the SAD the factory and momo. But dispite having plenty of chances to off momo even now he holds him hostage. Which is strange to say the least. It‚Äôs not like orochi wants any of the kozuki alive so why wouldn‚Äôt he tell them. 

-the things he has done so far haven‚Äôt actually resulted in any hinderance to the objective if anything he made the rebellion have more allies. 
Cat and Dog both have personal vendettas against kaidou now even though most of the other scabbards (kawamatsu asura doji and denjiro have almost given up their vendetta) the attack on zou was unsuccessful the alliance delay was unsuccessful the capture of law and luffy was unsuccessful the gathering of weapons was unsuccessful. 

Now this isn‚Äôt saying that was his intentions but it is note worthy that he hasn‚Äôt actually done anything to stop progress. 

- And the biggest piece of evidence 
He was willing to die in the pot with oden. Why would a traitor who hates the kozuki do that without having some affection for the kozuki and Oden. 

Again pretty flimsy theory but I felt one worth sharing to see if there is any credit or discrepancies I‚Äôm missing (because I‚Äôm a noob)",14,1584461577,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fk7wnl/kanjuro_double_agent_crack_pot_theory/,OnePiece,1

fk4shn,G_STAR_4LIFE,"How the heck was Shirahoshi so well renowned for her ""beauty"", when she had been locked up in the hard shell tower since the age of five?","For a long time, it had been built up that the mermaid Princesses beauty was so great that even Hancock paled in comparison. Oda hyped up Shirahoshi's beauty for so long, but looking back it doesnt really make sense.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but after the death of her mother, she started getting harassed by Vander Decken's death proposals. It was at this point Neptune decided to place Shirahoshi under full lockdown in the hard shell tower, and she was 5 when this took place.  No one had access to the tower aside from; Neptune, the brothers, ministers and maybe a few soldiers, but Oda went to lengths to make it clear that the residents of Fishman Island hadn't seen Shirahoshi in years, this is why they were so surprised when she came out of Megalo's mouth. Even Shirahoshi herself said she hadn't been out in 10 years. Not to mention most of the Neptune army who regularly reside in Ryugu Palace didn't even know what she looked like. I recall a scene where Sanji and Chopper are being arrested by Neptune soldiers and Sanji asks if the mermaid Princess is beautiful, the soldier replies he doesn't know but hes heard shes beautiful. This goes to show that even among the Neptune army, who have access to Ryugu Palace, seeing Shirahoshi is rare indeed and only specific people are given that level of clearance.

This begs the question, no one has seen Shirahoshi for a decade, WHO THE HELL IS CALLING HER MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HANCOCK!! No...forget that, if she was last scene in the public eye at age 5, WHO THE HECK IS CALLING A 5 YEAR OLD GIRL BEAUTIFUL?

In the current timeline Shirahoshi is 15 years old, yet every grown adult like Brook and Sanji fantasize about seeing her. Why are people so obsessed with a 15 year old girl that hasnt been seen since the age of 5?( of course I know shes out in the open now)

I think Oda initially wanted Shirahishi to be a lot older, because even pre-timeskip pirates were saying Hancock  couldn't match her beauty, but Shirahoshi would have been 13 at this point and she was last seen when she was 5. Its a bit creepy when you think about it, but I dont think its intentional, it's one of the rare instances in One Piece where Oda decided to retcon something.",21,1584449812,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fk4shn/how_the_heck_was_shirahoshi_so_well_renowned_for/,OnePiece,1

My theory is that uranus is a flying vehicle.

1st of all the three ancient weapons are all different in how they move.
     - poseidon aka shirahoshi is of the fishman race so she is able to swim at high speeds and breath underwater.
   
      - pluton is a warship so it's on water, not much is known other then that which is relevant to this theory.

     - if my logic is correct it will go under, on and above

2nd of all uranus is the Greek god of sky or heaven which is easy to understand why it would support my theory.

All of the flying vehicles revealed.
Caesers flying gas ballon
Shikis Island ship
God eneis ark maxim
All of the following are devil fruit reliant so there are no flying vehicles that don't require certain devil fruit abilities.

fk45nf,fizicar94,Kanjuro Devil Fruit Theory,"Kanjuro has a devil fruit has da devil fruit where he draws stuff/people to life with personalities, we don't know the name of the devil fruit.

We know that Kanjuro used to create brushes from dead people hair, and that he stole the body of yasue.

The Theory goes like this:

Kanjuros drawings take the personality from the hair from the brush.

The stronger the character, the better the drawing.

I think that shinobu was drawn with Yasues hair, because he is loyal and probably stronger than the average joe. Shinobu(Drawing) needed loyalty to kanjuro to pull it off on the beach.

&amp;

Kanjuro drew himself with his own hair, that explains the personality traits.

Kanjuro has a lot of hair, so we don't a haircut.

Maybe:

The strength of the drawing is based of the strength of the personality, because yasue has a strong personalty, Kanjuro stole his body to cut his hair.

Kanjuros drawings have the personalities of the original owners hair.

1. He is older than everybody in the crew. He feels out of place in a crew of teenagers. He is 44 for god sake.

2. He is too serious. We never get a funny comment of behavior from him. Even zoro that is always calm is hilarious sometimes.

3. He was already part of another Yonko crew. Doesn‚Äôt feel very loyal to me.

4. He doesn‚Äôt have a dream like everybody else.

fk2yxw,Blaue_Nase,Shinobu theory,"After reading chapter 974 most people assumed that Shinobu was most probably struck down by Kanjuro. In one panel we saw Shinobu holding Momo.

[Shinobu holds Momo](https://preview.redd.it/pd3nuejoi7n41.png?width=231&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9df06ef477942c594ae4259deb43292ad2882208)

The next time we see Momo he is held by Kanjuro.

[Kanjuro holds Momo](https://preview.redd.it/vw5ewgnvi7n41.png?width=255&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06d23a2a5d665b481bb5933db1c0e35df4dc9eb7)

The ""Kanjuro struck down Shinobu"" explanation just didn't work out for me, so I came up with a wild theory, based on actually just 2 minor facts. I don't know if someone else had this theory already, please let me know if this is the case!

I think that Kanjuro, the one Kinemon cut down, has always been a drawing, while the old Shinobu was the real Kanjuro all the time. My assumption here is that Kanjuro can change his appearance with his devil fruit power. So he acutally transformed back to his Kanjuro appearance on the coast. And he was the one holding Momo all along. 

The first ""minor fact"" is that the way Momo is hold is pretty much identical.

[Comparison of the two panels](https://preview.redd.it/5p6i4uihk7n41.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a39178ac259fa373f938bff1ce4d4b02c61e1153)

The second ""minor fact"" is just Shinobu's appearance. She changed quite a lot of these years. I know in some parts of Asia (at least South Korea, I've been there), people say that women look pretty up until their late 40s and don't really change their look. And ""over night"" they look like old grannies (in South Korea: so called ""ajumma""). However, I don't think this is the case here. She's also the one who comes up with theories who the traitor might be.

&amp;#x200B;

No where does that leave the real Shinobu? I don't have any evidence on where she could be. One thought was maybe as a spy with the Oniwabanshu, but cannot figure out which one it could be.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you think about that wild theory! I'm sure I missed some parts when Kanjuro and Shinbou are together but I couldn't find the time yet to analyze that.

I'm also pretty sure we will get the answer if this theory is correct or not in the next chapter :)

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Kanjuro was a drawing all along, old Shinobu was real Kanjuro",11,1584440838,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fk2yxw/shinobu_theory/,OnePiece,1
fk2ytc,FreeFunkFreed,Usopp will receive a real hammer on Elbaf,"I‚Äôm back again with another crackhead theory.

As we all know, a lot of Usopp‚Äôs lies end up coming true:

1) A giant goldfish (Little Garden)

2) A huge mole inside the mansion (Mrs. Merry Christmas)

3) A Cerberus (Thriller Bark)

4) A country of dwarves (Green Bit/Tontatta Tribe)

5)  A beautiful swordsman with meat (Rebecca)

There is more (Vegapunk‚Äôs Dragon), but the one I want to talk about is Usopp‚Äôs hammer!

Usopp has fought against a handful of opponents, and in [most](https://i.imgur.com/g4boU22.jpg) of them [he](https://i.imgur.com/VPIXk1s.jpg) has used a [hammer](https://i.imgur.com/vcoLSQs.jpg). 

His hammer has remained fairly consistent with his fighting style, and I believe he will eventually get a real hammer. It might not be the ridiculous 5 tons, but a heavy one nonetheless.

Usopp is apart of the original 5. He will become strong. His Dressrosa bounty spike was just the beginning. He too will be up there with Zoro and Sanji as Luffy‚Äôs main force. The infamous scene from [Arlong Park](https://i.imgur.com/vcoLSQs.jpg) was major foreshadowing. Additionally, he needs to surpass his father exactly how Luffy needs to surpass Shanks.

I‚Äôm not saying he needs a *hammer* to surpass his father. He can surpass him in sniping alone and that might be enough, but who knows.

**WHY ON ELBAF?**

1) Elbaf has references to Norse Mythology. We‚Äôve heard names like **Thor** and **Loki** thrown around casually. From Big Mom‚Äôs flashback, we see an obvious Viking feel from Elbaf. Mjolnir is an obvious thought as well. 

2)  Elbaf to Usopp is what Whole Cake Island was for Sanji, and what Wano is for Zoro. Usopp will undoubtedly receive his form of the Raid Suit or Enma during that arc. 


I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that the one member of the crew that wants so badly to visit Elbaf is known for using a hammer while he fights. It doesn‚Äôt have to be some special hammer, like Mjolnir, but one that he can use in combat against the stronger opponents moving forward.",53,1584440817,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fk2ytc/usopp_will_receive_a_real_hammer_on_elbaf/,OnePiece,1

fk0d04,Soulstriker1994,944 - Oda being funny,"I know I'm late to the party but I just recently started rereading some chapters containing denjiro\*. And I remembered there was a theory that something big was going to happen in Chapter 944. 

The theory stemmed from this cover art that had Zoro sitting on a grave that had 944 on the tombstone. 

 [https://i.redd.it/ig63anadknr21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/ig63anadknr21.jpg) 

People thought that someone was going to die ie. Zoro/Mihawk. Since a previous cover art had Luffy holding an Ace card and a death card before Ace's death.

 [http://i.imgur.com/Jv5ABeH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Jv5ABeH.jpg) 

People held such a high regard for the chapter and thought it was going to hold a massive impact on the story. Although there was an impact, it wasn't as game changing as someone dying. It did in fact hold a key part of Oda and his hatred of spoilers. So much in fact that he used Luffy to straight up tell us that ""no one tells him who's gonna die"".  

 [https://i.redd.it/fcmu5mftb6n41.png](https://i.redd.it/fcmu5mftb6n41.png) 

I find it even more amusing that this subreddit can legit be Queen sometimes.

I know this is a stretch, but such an iconic and future endowing scene with Luffy only makes the impact even greater. It's Oda's story, our predictions keep us at bay while new chapters release, but we gotta let the man surprise us every once in a while. He's done a great job the last 20 years, I cant wait for at least 5 more of these suspense filled years!

I looked around and I'm pretty sure he hasn't beat 10 of any big enemy so far. However...

In the current arc, we've already been shown the shadows of giant enemies, the Numbers from Kaido's crew. Now, based on the theme of Kaido's crew, playing cards, how many of the ""Numbers"" should there be? That's right. **10.**

Now this might be because I haven‚Äôt consumed enough media, or I just live under a rock of reading shitty manga, but this theme is very interesting to me, because I‚Äôve never really seen it tackled before. Obviously I‚Äôm not saying One Piece was the first to, it‚Äôs just that in media, lying is almost always portrayed as a really bad thing to do, even when it‚Äôs used for good it‚Äôs never really acknowledged. So to see Oda tackle how lying can be used for good and bad is very interesting. We get to meet Clahador who just screams ‚Äústuck up prick,‚Äù the suit and the way he‚Äôs standing in a really uptight way, shows this well. Oda does an excellent job of conveying a characters general traits based on design alone, and it‚Äôs something I can really appreciate. I guess he‚Äôs not really that villainous, but you can tell he looks down on Usopp, even if he tries to excuse it as protecting Kaya. So Usopp gets to Kayas house and begins telling her tall tales to make her feel better. I didn‚Äôt think Usopp would be joining the crew before this chapter, but I‚Äôm a lot more uncertain because of the events that take place during this one. More importantly, because as someone on reddit told me, Luffy thinks he‚Äôs a good dude. Which is ultimately the most important part of getting onto his crew.


&amp;nbsp; 

Luffy decides to go to the mansion after hearing this. Luffy basically home invading was funny, and honestly it‚Äôs a very pirate thing to do, and it‚Äôs nice to be reminded that they‚Äôre pirates every once in a while. Luffy half paying attention to Usopp while he talks about Luffy being part of his crew was funny as well, I think Usopp is written in a way where he could have been really fucking annoying but ends up being likable because of Odas good writing. Clahador comes to kick them out, Luffy asking for a boat and being instantly denied was great. So here we get a big character moment for Usopp. It turns out he actually is prideful,  because as soon as Clahador brings up his pirate dad, Usopp gets fucking pissed. This explains why he chose to make a group based around pirates, and also why he offered to join Luffy's crew. It also shows that Usopp isn‚Äôt a complete coward, when his dad's name is on the line he‚Äôs more than ready to beat the shit out of Clahador (which was really satisfying). It‚Äôs also interesting that Luffy implies knowing something about Usopp's dad. I swear if it‚Äôs Shanks I‚Äôm gonna die, but honestly they look nothing like eachother so I doubt it. Yeah this was a good chapter, I‚Äôm liking Usopp a lot, and the themes that Oda is exploring through him. I also just think the subtle comedy was really good here, and never got in the way of that impactful moment of Usopp punching Clahador.",5,1584421778,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fjzlbn/one_piece_journey_chapter_24_usopp_and_clahador/,OnePiece,1
fjzl3n,DarkWitch77,The problem with the other characters being the traitor,"Now that we know who the traitor is, the main problem with the other characters being the traitor specifically Carrot, Law, and Shinobu is that they wouldn't have the same emotional impact as compared to a Scabbard. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some people like Artur really wanted Carrot to be the traitor, but her being the traitor would not have any emotional impact especially to  characters like Kin'emon and the other Scabbards. The only thing it would have done is leave the readers in shock and that's it, the whole point of this traitor was more than to shock the readers. It was for both the readers and for the Scabbards to really feel betrayed, if someone like Carrot or Law was the traitor only the readers would maybe feel betrayed.

&amp;nbsp;

The feeling of really being betrayed as well as the emotional impact to Kin'emon and the other Scabbards would not really be there if the traitor was Carrot or Law, especially since those two didn't spend a whole lot of time with them. 

&amp;nbsp;

That's why a Scabbard being the traitor made a lot more sense, they have been with each other for a very long time and all of them served under Oden and were all loyal towards him to the point that they were willing to die alongside him. Having one of them be the traitor would not only be a huge betrayal but at the same time there would also be a huge emotional impact going with it as well, especially after the whole Oden flashback.

&amp;nbsp;

Again the whole point of this traitor wasn't just to shock the readers and have the readers feel betrayed, but it was also to have the characters specifically Kin'emon and the other Scabbards to really feel betrayed. 

&amp;nbsp;

Artur said that Carrot being the traitor would've had such an insane impact in the community, but imo I really don't think that would be the case. Yeah it would shock the community but more and more people would really start to question it especially with all the major flaws of her being the traitor. Her being the traitor would only shock the community and that's it, I really don't think it would leave any insane impact and characters like Kin'emon wouldn't really feel any emotional betrayal as compared to one of his closest friends being the traitor.   

&amp;nbsp;

He also thinks that Carrot being the traitor would make her have story relevance, and that is not true. Carrot doesn't need to be the traitor to have story relevance, don't forget the character focus that she had during the WCI arc. Oda can still give Carrot some story relevance, the problem right now is that the Wano arc has so much characters that Oda can't focus on everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

Overall a Scabbard being the traitor imo made a lot more sense not just for the story but also for the characters and the emotional impact that came with it, if it was Carrot, Law, or Shinobu then that same feeling just wouldn't be there. The only feeling would be shock and betrayal to the readers, again this traitor was to have a huge effect not just on the readers but also for Kin'emon and the other Scabbards.",4,1584421749,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fjzl3n/the_problem_with_the_other_characters_being_the/,OnePiece,1

fjw82f,sam_thunderdogs,Aokiji joining the raid on Onigashima?? *spoilers*,"Apologies if this theory has been posted before but I've been rereading the Wano arc and the old Jaminis Box translation notes brought up something interesting.

They mentioned the tale of Momotaro, the famous Japanese folk tale of a boy born from a peach. He goes to defeat an Oni on his island of Onigashima with his friends a dog, a monkey and a pheasant.

With how this relates to One Piece, I think we can clearly see Monosuke as Momotaro (hence their similar names) and Kaido as the Oni (Demon) on his island. But we still have a dog, a monkey and a pheasant to round out the crew. The monkey should be pretty obvious ^it's ^buggy but the dog could have a couple of choices. Most blatant is that it's Inuarashi, being a literal dog and all that. Other interpretations could be Kine'mon, as he is known as 'Foxfire' (this one is less believable but put for the sake of variety) or the Lion-Dog from the beginning of the arc Komachiyo. The pheasant is still unaccounted for, and the most obvious is being Aokiji, whose name translates as 'Blue Pheasant'.

***But how does he get there?*** -I hear you ask

This is where I think SWORD can be seen as an answer. We know Drake is secretly a spy for SWORD, a secret Marine agency to monitor the Yonkos. He is spying on Kaido. Its also shown that SWORD does not work with CP-0, who work for the Celestial Dragons, as Drake was worried about their presence in Wano. 



So here's my theory:

SWORD are a Marine organization who do NOT work directly under the Celestial Dragons. Instead, they work as a self-governing secret group within the Marines itself. As stated, the Admirals work directly under the Celestial Dragons, which is why Garp never became one, although he could have easily qualified for the position. 

I believe the leader of SWORD is Garp, my evidence being his distrust of the World Government (as shown by his not wanting to become an Admiral) and that Koby, his former pupil, is part of SWORD.

Carrying on, Aokiji is said to be currently bumming around with Blackbeard, another Yonko, after his resignation from Admiral position. Aokiji is also shown to respect Garp quite highly when he was younger (I think this is shown in one of the chapters released for the movies?) and states he 'owes a favour' to Garp anyway to Luffy, so they have history. Therefore I believe Aokiji is secretly working for SWORD, spying on the Blackbeard pirates for Garp. Blackbeard also stated that he was going to 'get something' before the Marines could. I think Blackbeard, and the Marines, are heading for Wano, which would bring Aokiji along with them, bringing him into contact with the Momotaro squad.

**THE WAR OF WANO**

- The Nine Red Scabbards, to bring a Dawn to Wano's Centuries closed borders, fulfill a Destiny foretold 800 years ago, when JoyBoy sent Toki forward in time..the 'D's would come, and liberate Wano from its Enslavement by the World Government, forced to Forge their Seastone...for so many years....they kept secret the limits of their craftsmanship, for 800 years ago, the first Kozuki, **Kozuki Peach**, leader of a **Warrior** Country, a **Spirit** country, a **Haki** country, a **Ryo** country, and a **WILLPOWER** country, **FORGED** the Poneglyphs for JoyBoy, for the first Kozuki **was Uranus, the reincarnation of the Sky God himself**, and his bloodline would **slave away**, and **look the fool**, no matter how long it took, for the Foretold One...the one who would rescue them...and re-unite Wano with it's original co-inhabitants....

- THE MINKS, Whose island segment that was once connected to Wano, ZOU, had been placed on the back of Zunesha, by the first Kozuki (Using his immense Advanced CoC, using 'The Voice of all Things'), in order to aid JoyBoy in protecting and rescuing them before the World Government could complete its invasion and takeover...which, when the dust settled, was easy. 

- How does the World Government, who committed the Void Century, make sure this violent, primitive nation of Monkeys **KEEPS** its borders closed, so you can **enslave** them to forge you **Kairoseki** evermore? You send **CP0**, your strongest of strong, and most *secret of secret* organization, to **make sure** they understand. 

Oden was Uranus. BAHAHAHAHA Oda that's so rude! URANUS IS ALWAYS BETTER BOILED 

This is why he could hear 'the voice of all things', he had the Sky God's incarnation, their Spirit...their Haki...their Dispositon. THIS is why he was so strong from such an early age, because he had Conquerors Haki, VERY STRONG Conquerors Haki...he didn't have the Disposition of a King, he had the **Disposition of a God**, and THAT'S why One Piece feels so powercreep. Roger took Oden, because he HAD to...to show him the TRUE HISTORY written there...where did he take him?

 Skypiea. Water 7. Fishman Island. It's all right there people. 

***Ready?***

**The 9 red scabbards of the Worst Generation**

- Luffy (""""""awakening"""""", c'mon guys, wake up)

- Kidd

- Law

- Killer

- Zoro (who will go Demon mode btw, expect asura/black blade off the wazoo, he has kings haki)

- X-Drake

- Apoo

- Hawkins

- Blackbeard

and all of their crews (thus, also Kuzan)

**alongside**

- Momonosuke, known to History as the Ancient Weapon Uranus, all of the older Scabbards, all of the warriors and samurai and ninja of Wano, and all of the Yakuza, lead by Hyogoro and Kyoshiro
- Zunesha, with the Minks, Jimbe, Shirahoshi (known to History as the Ancient Weapon, Posiedon), Wadatsumi, and the **entire straw hat grand fleet**, who were all delivered a single thing: a tiny, tiny little scrap of paper, with the word 'ZOU' on it, and a note, with a word: **COME. WANO.**, (Hence Hajrudin left Buggy suddenly)

**Yonko Alliance**

- Kaido, the Calamities, the Hundred Beast Pirates, and all of his SMILE imbued Fleet of warriors

- Big Mom, along with the arrival of all her Sweet Commanders, Officers, and greater fleet

**The Marines**

- Sakazuki, and Borsalino, flanked by Rob Lucci, Kaku, and the rest of CP0, and 10 Battleships/Vice-Admirals (double buster call), and the newest range of Pacifista, now that the Shichibukai are no more

***Other***

- Dracule Mihawk

- Red-Hair Shanks

*SO*

Kaido is there fatefully, because his Ancestor, **Oars**, was made to pull the continents of Wano together, to easier control the ""difficult races"", and is an 'experiment' of the World Government, in COMBINING two Mythical Zoans.... Dragon + Oni 

Oni are characters in Japenese literature and theater, and are typically stock enemies in folk stories, such as that of ""Momotar√µ"" ""Peach Boy), who informs his parents when they find him inside a peach that he was blessed to them by the Gods, and fights an Oni and bunch of demons on their land, along with a Monkey (Luffy), Dog (Kidd), and Pheasant (Law) to help him along the way.

However, in THIS story, there are opposing Dog (Sakazuki), Monkey (Borsalino), and Pheasant (Kuzan)

Big Mom. After Linlin killed the Giant King, 'Jarul', another giant wanted to pierce her in her sleep, and kill her sheer demonic strength, but mother caramel begged him to let them simply leave, and who begged Jarul to kill Linlin.....Hajrudin

Mother caramel, who was known as Holy Mother due to being so lovely, but was actually selling children to the world bloody government, to become **marines** and **Cipher Pol** agents....SHE SOLD LUCCI TO THE WORLD GOVERNMENT, AND NOW HE'S BACK IN WANO, FOR THE BIG FIGHT, REVENGE AGAINST LUFFY.....this woman, said they would leave....

***So, here we go:***

- Big Mom, Kaido, and BlackBeard all have part of Xebec's soul in them, and that's why they so strong, and thats why they all want to be King of the World (see: Luffies 'shadow' put into Oars in thriller bark, making him immediately wanna be pirate king and assume he can strerch) **FORESHADOWING GODA**

- *The plan* is for Big Mom to take from Blackbeard and Kaido, the Soul of Xebec that they have stored for so long, that has given them such strength, that has birthed their own Dreams....and to put it in **Teach**, who would then, having the Gura-Gura (strongest Paramecia), and the Yami-Yami (strongest Logia), be ***Xebec Reborn***

- BUT, this is Rocks we're talking about, and not Whitebeards *family* crap, here it is kill or be killed, Big Mom plans, at some point, JUST when the Mugiwara look beaten, to rip ALL of Xebec's 'Haki/Soul' from Teach, and to split it with Kaido, and thus re-unite their Families, and become King and Queen of the World

- However, Big Mom will ***steal it from Teach AND Kaido***, and thus ***take back*** the debt that he owes her...SHE would Inherit the Will of Xebec...and ....and....dammit, why now? Why, of all times, would she **think of that wonderful cake now**, the *only time* in the last few decades she had felt that happiness...that ***love***....she would ***unite all races in the World, as their Queen***

- TEACH, will do the same thing he did at Marineford: he will **use the Yami-Yami to absorb the Spirit into Himself**, and thus, we near the climax...***THIS WAS ROCKS SECRET PLAN, THE LURKING LEGEND***, the plan that **Teach**...that poor scared orphan, not  able to sleep, lest Xebec take over...***never knew he was following***

- ***ROBBED OF HIS WILL***

- ***ROBBED OF HIS DREAM***

- ***HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT***

- ***IN PIRATES THEMSELVES***

When Luffy uses Red Hawk, and thinks of Ace, and his Blood gets Burning.....that's Fireblood. Spirit. Haki. Ryo. Mantra. Soul.

Luffy has the **Disposition of a King** like no other, and *every time he uses Red Hawk*, we get *flash ups* of Aces face.

And what does Tama say when she sees Luffy use Red Hawk, after only having met Ace once?

*it reminds her of Ace*

......wait......
........do you hear that?..........
.......   its....its a.....RUMBLE.........

**""Huh? Are the Humans fighting? How noisy...no matter. Die.""**

""***RAIGO***""

*Kaido, shrivelled, thin, and weaker than he had felt in so long...in decades....finally devoid of that toxic, immense Haki...that Conquering, controlling, **POWERFUL** Haki....he was free*

*the ground cracks beneath *Xebec*'s feet, as his legs and arms expand, his torso reforms, his hair grows wilder, the very *SKY* above him splits, even he did not think his plan would go so well....*

*o-Tama walks up to Kaido, unable to hear anything, unaware of the screams of the Retainers, of Zoro, of *Luffy*.....and takes a piece of *kibi* off her cheek, placing it in Kaido's mouth*

***WARMTH. HEAT, not cold, but surges of fiery blood ran down his veins, and Kaido felt .... warmth.....happiness.....love***

**Kaido + Big Mom + Rocks Flashback* (You'll see, GOda)

*CLENCHING his fists so that his fingers cracked the ground, - to the startled cries of the futiely approaching *mugiwara* - Kaido threw back his impressive head, and through streams of crystal clear tears, he SCREAMS:*

***MUGI-WARAAAAAAAA!!! THANK....THANK YOUUU!!!!!!!!!***

*Luffies face only hesitates for a moment, before flickering into a smile*

***""ShiShiShiShi, you're welcome! For what?""***

***-inhaaaale- ONE PIECE!!!!!!***

silence 

***DOES EXIST!!!***

**a solid beam of light pierces right through Kaido's chest, his face still mirroring Luffies closed-eye, ear-to-ear smile. It didn't look too good, but hey, he'd never truly done it before**

***KABOOOOOOOOOOOM***

*""Myyyy, myyyyyy......they just do it to themselveees.""*

*""BORSALINO, I NEED YOU TO TAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUSLY FOR ONCE, SO GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR EAR, LUCCI, TAKE CP9 AND GO FOR MUGIWARA, BORSALINO, KNOCK THAT PRICK OUT OF THE SKY, EVERYONE ELSE, PACIFISTA-X (or whatever new Pacifista will be called), AT TEACH!!! CHAAAAAARGE!!!!!!""*

***Shanks will show up, to stop Teach, to stop Xebec, as Roger did...as Whitebeard was trying to....***

***Mihawk will show up and kill Enel with a single slash***

silence 

***Then he will kill Shanks***

***he had failed...it was Luffies task now...***

Dont worry borsalino will die tho, Sakazuki will escape, Luffy will escape, as will Xebec, with heavy losses tho, not that he gives a fuck, and Lucci, having been beaten AGAIN by Luffy, will begrudgingly fight by his side in the Final Great War. 

**Called it.**

Also, **JoyBoy had the Lightning-Lightning (Rumble-Rumble) Fruit last, and Im has desperately searched for it ever since, and *I know where it was***

As for Pluton, it was obvious:

*a ship with the power to wipe out an island with a single blast*

*a ship needing intricate metalwork, glass work, ancient knowledge of electricity, and lots...*LOTS* of Gold*

*a ship, last built by Kozuki Peach, and his Master Shipwrights, for JoyBoy himself to use against Im-sama*

*remember when there was a door, right back at the start, that Higuma kicked down? In the next panel it was fixed...someone asked him about it...and he said something to the effect of, *""oh, um yes! Good spot! I was wondering if anyone would, see that...Ugh, Ahem, anyway, that was the most masterful woodsman in the world! and this is what he looks like!""* 

***wanna know who it is? The craftsman, that Franky is working under, when in hiding, in Wano***

*a ship that Franky will recognize, that HE and Iceberg, some of the most amazing shipwrights of the Shipbuilding Island, wondered if it was even possible to build*

*an Ancient weapon that was not buried in Alabasta, that was just JoyBoy's middle finger at Im, for he knew he would look, and instead left it in the hands of its creators (or at least carriers.....): the Master Shipwrights of Water 7*

I could say more to convince you, but I've said enough.

You'll see.

fjvxdl,VergoVox,About Unintentionally Spoiling Titles(Up till ch.974),"Some threads in this sub-reddit have lately been much too eager to use unconventional names that apply secondary spoilers to other users, especially anime-onlies.

For example, I and my friend theorized Kanjuro being a Kurozumi and traitor after the chapter with boiling(first we thought it was the Kurozumi granny/ink painting, next chapter confirmed it could be a painting), and thus when the sub-reddit started posting Kanjuro threads on Wednesday before the most recent chapter, like ""Just noticed Kanjuro's hair looks like paintbrush"" ""Is Kanjuro gonna be relevant"" etc, it became quite obvious that the traitor was indeed him, and the traitor reveal would very likely occur this week. More credibility was given to the thoughts when the threads were either downvoted/deleted. Right now there's a thread 

""The traitor was right-handed all along"" which has the potential to give away at least these pieces of information to those following the anime, or having not read the most recent official release:  


* There IS a traitor
* The now-confirmed traitor is right-handed, which means that he has likely used his weaker arm for what he has done, which means that it COULD have to do with Kanjuro's shoddy art. (It may also mislead some to think of Nekomamushi because he lost his left hand, but that's quite far-off)
* The traitor sub-plot is brought up again and concluded
* The thread is marked as spoilers, so it is not a parody

There have also been a lot of ""Naval Battle"" titled speculation posts and posts about the last spread, which spoil that there will be a confrontation at Sea before Onigashima, and it starts/occurs in chapter 974. Now with this era of infrequent releases, I find myself being able to visit the sub-reddit only from Friday evening-Tuesday evening, due to the ever-increasing chance of unintentional spoilerposting.(Friday evening is the time I expect the first quality scans to pop up, but am now prepared to wait till Sunday evening if it looks like there's only a day's delay)

My post is a bit messy, and I realize that a lot of the userbase is fine with things as is, but sometimes I feel that people do not respect the other fans, especially those waiting only for the official releases",10,1584405817,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fjvxdl/about_unintentionally_spoiling_titlesup_till_ch974/,OnePiece,1

One thing I haven't seen talked about is how Luffy has already surpassed Roger in so many ways. Roger was the Ocarina of Time of pirates- sure he was a revolutionary step forward for his day, but his exploits haven't exactly aged as well as the world remembers.

Luffy is the Breath of the Wild of pirates. Taken the tone and spirit of the series and catalyzed it into something that's truly timeless, despite his faults.

fjty5a,Scicageki,Wano - How Myth and History have been weaved together,"&amp;#x200B;

[dooon \~](https://preview.redd.it/snf50ibel2n41.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3533156d6ece8017900b9b27afc29b368940120)

It's undeniable that Oda has been setting up Wano arc for a long time, starting all the way back being mentioned the first time back during the Thriller Bark arc (in 2007, chapter 450), and that this arc is one of the most well thought-out since the time skip.

What I personally find masterful about this specific arc in the series is the level of detail that has been given to different elements of the setting. It's quite easy to make up an ""alternate version"" of Japan just by taking few elements here and there and plotting them out basically changing the names of characters and places, but what Oda is doing here is quite different! He is weaving together taking from all *Japan history* and *Japanese mythology* together to make a world that ""feels like Japan"", while being different enough to not being immediately recognizable... and what I found really astounding is the number of small references you could find here and there to facts and fictions.

This post is intended as being both an appreciation post of the arc that's going on right now and being as well a detailed analysis of the biggest historical and mythological sources present in the stories... and maybe, knowing what's already there and what's not it would be easier to plot out theories for the future of the Wano arc and what would happen next.

# 1. Momotar≈ç (""The Peach Boy"")

The history of Momotaro ""The Peach Boy"" has been a heavy source of inspiration for the conflict in between Kaido and Momonosuke.

https://preview.redd.it/pe9jetpr43n41.jpg?width=318&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e95c5369036b74105aea05cd14365cdff1a3e5f1

&gt;*Once upon a time, in a small village, lived an old man and his wife. One day, the old woman saw a very big peach coming down the river. She picked it up and took it home. Later, when they cut the peach, a small boy came out of it. They named him Momotaro and, since they had no children, they raised him with love and care.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Momotaro grew up healthy and he become the strongest man in the village. When he heard that some oni living on the Onigashima island (""island of oni‚Äú) were terrorizing the nearby villages, he decided to go to drive them away. His old parents were worried, because an oni is a scary creature. Having a humanoid shape, thick red skin, powerful claws, horns and long, sharp teeth, the oni is huge, very strong and carries an iron club called kanabo. But Momotaro begged them to let him go, so the old woman prepared for him some kibidango (Japanese dumplings made from millet flour).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*On his way, Momotaro met a dog who asked him where he was going and what he was carrying. So Momotaro told him that he was going to Onigashima, and that he was carrying the most delicious kibidango in all Japan. Then, the dog agreed to go with Momotaro and help him in exchange for the delicious kibidango. Later, the same thing happened with a pheasant and again with a monkey.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*They all went to the island and because they ate those kibidango, the best in Japan, Momotaro‚Äôs party grew so strong that they easily vanquished the oni and made them promise that they will never attack the villagers again. Plus, Momotaro took all the treasures stolen by the oni and gave them back to the villagers‚Ä¶*

The following are the recurring elements in the story:

|*Mythic Element*|*One Piece Element*|*Chapter*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Momotaro**|Kozuki Momonosuke|[chapter 685](https://i10.mangapanda.com/one-piece/685/one-piece-3646773.jpg)|
|**Onigashima**|Onigashima|[chapter 920](https://i6.mangapanda.com/one-piece/920/one-piece-11385073.jpg)|
|**King of the Oni**|Kaido|[chapter 818](https://i2.mangapanda.com/one-piece/818/one-piece-7166713.jpg)|
|**Kanabo**|Kaido's Mace|[chapter 923](https://i6.mangapanda.com/one-piece/923/one-piece-11486695.jpg)|
|**Kibidango**|O-Tama|[chapter 911](https://i4.mangapanda.com/one-piece/911/one-piece-10995499.jpg)|
|**Talking Dog**|Inuarashi|[chapter 920](https://i8.mangapanda.com/one-piece/920/one-piece-11385007.jpg)|
|**Talking Monkey**|Luffy||
|**Talking Pheasant**|Marco? Kuzan?||

That's kinda straightforward. I think that both Marco and Kuzan could be ""the last possible ally for the alliance"", since they both could fall in the pheasant figure while being absent from the scene for far too much time.

# 2. Yamata no Orochi (""Eight-Headed Giant Serpent"")

The history of the defeat of Yamata no Orochi has been a heavy source of inspiration for the conflict against Orochi and in his characterization as a character:

https://preview.redd.it/m0wqry8193n41.jpg?width=340&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53492df209615f3a4f66ee0933d7f78efb553710

&gt;*Yamata no Orochi is a serpent-dragon in Japanese myth. The Orochi has eight heads and eight tails, and its enormous body reaches across eight valleys and eight hills. (You're probably noticing a pattern here.)*  
&gt;  
&gt;*When* *Susano\*\*o is in exile from the heavens, he finds a couple and their daughter crying by the river. They explain their sadness to him ‚Äî that every year, the Orochi comes to devour one of their daughters. This year, they must give up their eigth and final daughter, Kushinada.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*To save her, Susanoo proposes marriage to Kushinada. When she accepts, he transforms her into a comb which he can then carry in his hair. Kushinada's parents must brew sake, he explains, and refine it eight times. They must also build an enclosure with eight gates, each of which includes a vat of sake.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*When the Orochi arrives, he is lured in towards the sake, and dips each of his heads into one of the vats. The drunken beast is now weakened and disoriented, allowing Susanoo to quickly slay it.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*As Susanoo cuts the monster into pieces, he uncovers a great sword that had grown inside the Orochi. This blade, the Kusanagi, is presented to Amaterasu as a gift to reconcile their dispute.*

The following are the recurring elements in the story:

|*Mythic Element*|*One Piece Element*|*Chapter*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Yamata no Orochi**|Kurozumi Orochi|[chapter 932](https://i3.mangapanda.com/one-piece/932/one-piece-11866315.jpg)|
|**Susanoo**|Zoro? Momo?||
|**Kushinada (with cumbs)**|Kozuki Hiyori (adorned hairs)|[chapter 928](https://i7.mangapanda.com/one-piece/928/one-piece-11645833.jpg)|
|**Kusanagi**|Ame no Habakiri|[chapter 954](https://i10.mangapanda.com/one-piece/954/one-piece-12828331.jpg)|

In the original myth, Yamata no Orochi also asked for young females as sacrifices and Kushinada would have been the last one. Notice that in many sources Yamata no Orochi is described as being often drunk, trait that I think has been influenced the depiction/development of Kaido as a character. Also, it's worth to notice that the [Kusanagi blade](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ama_no_Murakumo) is also named Ame no Habakiri, so the parallel here is striking.

# 3. Hyakki Yagy≈ç (""Night Parade of One Hundred Demons"")

Hyakki Yagyo is a concept in¬†Japanese folklore, where a parade composed of a hundred kinds of¬†y≈çkai march through the streets of Japan at night.

https://preview.redd.it/hfyhwsjfc3n41.jpg?width=1598&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c41ca6ef79a7a383afc8b883dfbd83abeae126f1

I think that this myth here has been split. Naturally the Beast Pirates has been inspired (in their monstrous form and in their numbers, also as a general [visual identity for the Numbers](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/f/fa/Numbers_Infobox.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20190830062656)) by the riot nature of the Hyakki Yakgyo, but the source story seems to me too much relevant in this specific situation.

&gt;*Sometimes an orderly procession, other times a riot, it refers to an uncontrolled horde of countless numbers of supernatural creatures known as* *oni* *and* *y≈çkai*\*, lead by Nurarihyon, a monster that cannot be caught. In some sources, that number is referred as being 500 demons.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The story that originated the Hyakki Yagyo is: ""A young nobleman is ordered to close up his house in Kyoto and move immediately to the new Imperial court in Fukuhara. Although while he's gone a trusted servant stays behind to care for the house, when he returns, he finds the house infested with one hundred* *y≈çkai* *lke* *Oni*\*,\* *Tengu* *and others. All those demons were using his house to make a good party.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Such story of the Hyakki Yagyo originated in a Shinto Fire Festival myth about the Kumano Mountains. It is said that, once a year, all the Shinto gods are supposed to meet on this mountain.*

The following is speculation, but I feel it's based:

|*Mythic Element*|*One Piece Element*|*Chapter*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Fire Festival**|Fire Festival|[chapter 958](https://i7.mangapanda.com/one-piece/958/one-piece-12936781.jpg)|
|**Trusted Servant/Nurarhyon**|Kyoshiro/Ushimitsu Kozo|[chapter 973](https://i999.mangapanda.com/one-piece/973/one-piece-13425253.jpg)|
|**Young Noblemen**|Kurozumi Orochi|[chapter 958](https://i1.mangapanda.com/one-piece/958/one-piece-12936769.jpg)|
|**Procession**|Samurai Prisoners|[chapter 955](https://i3.mangapanda.com/one-piece/955/one-piece-12871777.jpg)|

My interpretation of such a myth is that we will see a procession of freed peasant Samurai coming from the Flower Capital, marching during the Fire Festival, guided by Denjiro, who was trusted by Kurozumi Orochi (...and that was his plan all along).

# 4. Benkei and Yoshitsune

This was the myth surrounding two historical figures in Japan, Minamoto Yoshitsune (on the right) and Benkei (on the left). Naturally those two spawned the whole Ringo region story, being the source material for Onimaru and the Shimotsuki clan.

https://preview.redd.it/aag3y5yoh3n41.jpg?width=3159&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2a2833c0e8778d3da32f3f8373d60abc23b0bbe

&gt;*Benkei was a warrior monk who lived in Japan in the twelfth century. Though most of the stories associated with him are exaggerated to the stature of myth and legend, he was undoubtedly a real person.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Minamoto Yoshitsune is one of the best-loved historical figures in Japan. He was a brilliant warrior who lived from 1159 to 1189. He helped his older brother Yoritomo gain control of Japan. Later, Yoritomo established the first shogunate in Japan.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Yoshitsune‚Äôs father, Minamoto Yoshihomo was killed by his enemy Taira Kiyomori in 1160, when Yoshitsune was less than a year old. Kiyomori spared Yoshitsune, but put him in a monastery in Kyoto. Here, Yoshitsune trained to become a Buddhist monk.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Legend says that it was near this monastery, on the Goyo Bridge in Kyoto, that Yoshitsune met Benkei. A popular version of the story maintains that Benkei would hide by night under the Goyo bridge, and challenge all who passed to a swordfight. He would keep the swords of those he defeated. In this way Benkei had collected 999 swords and was in search of the one-thousandth sword when he encountered Yoshitsune.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Yoshitsune and Benkei remain among Japan‚Äôs best-loved heroes. Their adventures have given birth to a host of myths, legends and stories, while incidents from their lives often form the theme of Kabuki plays and Noh performances.*

The following are the recurring elements in the story:

|**Minamoto Yoshitsune**|Ushimaru Shimotsuki|[chapter 953](https://i10.mangapanda.com/one-piece/953/one-piece-12799471.jpg)|

It's worth to notice that historically Minamoto Yoshitsune was killed due to betrayal (in the same way it happens to Ushimaru in the series). It's very interesting to notice that the Zoro Shimotsuki theory here is heavily supported by having many sources about a potential surviving son fathered by Yoshitsune with his mistress Shizuka, who fled the castle while carrying is unborn child... not a fan of the theory, but it still starts to have more legs now.

# 5. Shimabara Rebellion

The Shimabara Rebellion was the largest civil conflict in Japan during the Edo period, and was one of only a handful of instances of serious unrest during the relatively peaceful period of the Tokugawa shogunate's rule.

https://preview.redd.it/oonl7dyxn3n41.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4feaa15ef6311117c2897903748fdd789637e97

The¬†**Shimabara Rebellion**¬†was a Catholic peasant uprising in Japan that occurred from 1637 to 1638. The rebellion occurred in reaction to tax increases and the persecution of Christians by the Tokugawa Shogunate, and the Tokugawa sent 125,000 troops to suppress the rebels at Hara Castle. In the wake of the rebellion, the prohibition of Christianity was strictly enforced, and Japan's isolationism was tightened and the official persecution of Christians continued until the 1850s. Some interesting elements are the fact that the Rebellion grew around the Hara castle (which was a dismantled castle), the fact that Myamoto Musashi fought with the besieging forces as well as the Koga ninja and that the rebels were ultimately defeated. Emosaku Yamada is believed to have been a traitor from the Tokugawa shogunate.

|**Miyamoto Musashi**|**??**||

It's important to notice that the Kurozumi Shogunate is realistically associated with the Tokugawa Shogunate, since the period in which Japan was under tight isolationism was during the Tokugawa Shogunate. The most notorious person who was fighting under the Tokugawa Shogunate at the time was Miyamoto Musashi, known as being historically ""one of the strongest swordsman in history"". Is there somebody else (possibly a dual-wielding samurai) we still don't know who could represent such a strong samurai? Maybe the Mimawarigumi's captain?

# 6. Tokugawa Shogunate

The **Tokugawa Shogunate** was a shogunate led by the Tokugawa clan from 1603 to 1868, reigning for exactly 265 years. In this case, being the Tokugawa Shogunate similar to the Kurozumi Shogunate in portrayal, some of the elements have been kept, mixed and then used for the story.

https://preview.redd.it/v02dw38es3n41.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87e3ea2e65eb2027a905a9c9475411dca5b9ecc9

* **Sakoku policy (""Closed Country"")**

&gt;*Sakoku  was the* *isolationist* *foreign policy* *of the* *Japanese* *Tokugawa shogunate* *under which, for a period of over 220 years, relations and trade between Japan and other countries were severely limited, nearly all foreign nationals were barred from entering Japan and common Japanese people were kept from leaving the country.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Japan was not completely isolated under the sakoku policy. It was a system in which strict regulations were applied to commerce and foreign relations by the shogunate and by certain feudal domains. There was extensive trade with* *China* *through the port of Nagasaki, in the far west of Japan, with a residential area for the Chinese.*

* **Mimawarigumi (""Special Force Police"")**

&gt;*Sakoku  was the* *isolationist* *foreign policy* *of the* *Japanese* *Tokugawa shogunate* *under which, for a period of over 220 years, relations and trade between Japan and other countries were severely limited, nearly all foreign nationals were barred from entering Japan and common Japanese people were kept from leaving the country.*

* **Katanagari (""Sword Hunt"")**

&gt;Several times in Japanese history, the new ruler sought to ensure his position by calling a sword hunt (ÂàÄÁã©, *katanagari*). Armies would scour the entire country, confiscating the weapons of the enemies of the new regime. In this manner, the new ruler sought to ensure that no one could take the country by force as he had just done.

|**Sword Hunt**||[chapter 926](https://i4.mangapanda.com/one-piece/926/one-piece-11561917.jpg)|

One of the most important historical element that's still missing is the event of the [**Kurofune**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ships) **or ""Black Ships""**, that coincided with the arrival of Westerner vessels entering the Edo Bay and that was the whole reason for Japan opening their borders (in real history). I personally take this historic event as a possible hint of the arrival of Blackbeard right at the end of Wano for him to force the island to open their borders by gunboat diplomacy (and take a new fruit or a road poneglyph? Who knows, really).

# 8. Ak≈ç incident or Forty-seven Ronin

The revenge of the forty-seven *r≈çnin*, also known as the Ak≈ç incident is an 18th-century historical event in Japan in which a band of *r≈çnin* (leaderless samurai) avenged the death of their master. It could be pointed at being one of the sources of inspiration for the *Nine Red Scabbards.*

https://preview.redd.it/3m6t89m0n3n41.jpg?width=1446&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d350abf53484e408a02524e18fc577658ccb0a9

The story is a detailed revenge mission that was taken after years and years of the death of their lord, so it's very simple to make some connections here. I still think there is a little bit more behind some of the Scabbards, at least for their names, roles and/or other details.

1. **Oden -** Oden seems to be partially inspired by Oda Nobunaga, whose name is very similar, (being the very last noble before the Tokugawa shogunate, having a bad attitude/fame and having his castle burned down to ash) and [Goemon Ishikawa](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Excecution_of_Goemon_Ishikawa.jpg/170px-Excecution_of_Goemon_Ishikawa.jpg).
2. **Kinemon -** A different rebellion against the Tokugawa Shogunate was the [Kinmon Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinmon_incident);
3. **Kanjuro -** Emosaku Yamada.
4. **Raizo? -** Possibly a reference to Hanzo, a famous Ninja of the Iga clan (not from Koga)?
5. **Ashura Doji/Shutenmaru -** Named after the eponymous creature [Shuten-Doji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuten-d%C5%8Dji).
6. **Kawamatsu -** Inspired from the myth of [Urashima Taro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urashima_Tar%C5%8D), which was a fisherman who saved a small turtle on the beach which was tortured by a lot of evil people... and Kawamatsu was exactly that tortle. It's relevant to notice that the rest of the whole plot for that myth has become already Fishman Island.
7. **Denjiro -** Nurarihyon.

First of all, I had to delete all my previous posts, because once you ""discover"" One Piece, you realize why you discovered it, and what it is.

Do you want to see it, Human?

Lo, I have become Kami:

**THE WAR OF WANO**
- The Nine Red Scabbards, to bring a Dawn to Wano's Centuries closed borders, fulfill a Destiny foretold 800 years ago, when JoyBoy sent Toki forward in time..the 'D's would come, and liberate Wano from its Enslavement by the World Government, forced to Forge their Seastone...for so many years....they kept secret the limits of their craftsmanship, for 800 years ago, the first Kozuki, **Kozuki Peach**, leader of a **Warrior** Country, a **Spirit** country, a **Haki** country, a **Ryo** country, and a **WILLPOWER** country, **FORGED** the Poneglyphs for JoyBoy, for the first Kozuki **was Uranus, the reincarnation of the Sky God himself**, and his bloodline would **slave away**, and **look the fool**, no matter how long it took, for the Foretold One...the one who would rescue them...and re-unite Wano with it's original co-inhabitants....THE MINKS, Whose island segment that was once connected to Wano, ZOU, had been placed on the back of Zunesha, by the first Kozuki (Using his immense Advanced CoC, using 'The Voice of all Things'), in order to aid JoyBoy in protecting and rescuing them before the World Government could complete its invasion and takeover...which, when the dust settled, was easy. How does the World Government, who committed the Void Century, make sure this violent, primitive nation of Monkeys **KEEPS** its borders closed, so you can **enslave** them to forge you **Kairoseki** evermore? You send **CP0**, your strongest of strong, and most *secret of secret* organization, to **make sure** they understand. 
- Oden was Uranus. BAHAHAHAHA Oda that's so rude! URANUS IS ALWAYS BETTER BOILED 
- This is why he could hear 'the voice of all things', he had the Sky God's incarnation, their Spirit...their Haki...their Dispositon. THIS is why he was so strong from such an early age, because he had Conquerors Haki, VERY STRONG Conquerors Haki...he didn't have the Disposition of a King, he had the **Disposition of a God**, and THAT'S why One Piece feels so powercreep. Roger took Oden, because he HAD to...to show him the TRUE HISTORY written there...where did he take him? Skypiea. Water 7. Fishman Island. 

It's all right there people. Ready?
- Big Mom has the soul-soul fruit. She got it by accidentally EATING mother caramel, who was known as Holy Mother due to being so lovely, but was actually selling children to the world bloody government, to become **marines** and **Cipher Pol** agents....SHE SOLD LUCCI TO THE WORLD GOVERNMENT, AND NOW HE'S BACK IN WANO, FOR THE BIG FIGHT, after Linlin killed the Giant King, 'Jarul', another giant wanted to pierce her in her sleep, but mother caramel begged him to let them simply leave, and who begged Jarul to kill Linlin.....Hajrudin
- ugh I'm bored of connecting all the dots, just so much to write, you get the idea, basically its:

**The 9 red scabbards of the Worst Generation**
- Luffy (""""""awakening"""""", c'mon guys, wake up)
- Kidd
- Law
- Killer
- Zoro (who will go Demon mode btw, expect asura/black blade off the wazoo, he has kings haki)
- X-Drake
- Apoo
- Hawkins
- Blackbeard
- and all of their crews

As well as 
- All of the older Scabbards, all of the warriors and samurai and ninja of Wano, and all of the Yakuza, lead by Hyogoro and Kyoshiro
- Zunesha, with the Minks, Jimbe, Shirahoshi, Wadatsumi, and the **entire straw hat grand fleet**

- Kaido, the Calamities, the Hundred Beast Pirates, and all of his SMILE imbued Fleet of warriors
- Big Mom, along with the arrival of all her Sweet Commanders, Officers, and greater fleet

- Sakazuki, and Borsalino, flanked by Rob Lucci, Kaku, and the rest of CP0, and 10 Battleships/Vice-Admirals (double buster call)

Kaido is there because his Ancestor, Oars, was made to pull the continents of Wano together, to easier control the ""difficult races"", and is an 'experiment' of the World Government, in COMBINING two Mythical Zoans.... Dragon + Oni 

Oni are characters in Japenese literature and theater, and are typically stock enemies in folk stories, such as that of ""Momotar√µ"" ""Peach Boy), who informs his parents when they find him inside a peach that he was blessed to them by the Gods, and fights an Oni and bunch of demons on their land, along with a Monkey (Luffy), Dog (Kidd), and Pheasant (Law) to help him along the way.

However, in THIS story, there are opposing Dog (Sakazuki), Monkey (Borsalino), and Pheasant (Kuzan)

Oh, and Big Mom, Kaido, and BlackBeard all have part of Xebec's soul in them, and that's why they so strong, and thats why they all want to be King of the World (see: Luffies 'shadow' put into Oars in thriller bark, making him immediately wanna be pirate king and assume he can strerch) **FORESHADOWING** and Xebec will probably ""Return"", it will be everyone mutually taking him, BM, Kaido, and BB on basically. BUT, Teach will betray him/them, and steal Xebec or Kaido or Linlin, or ANY of MANY Devil Powers (he doesn't do it via the 'eating' way that LinLin did....)

When Luffy uses Red Hawk, and thinks of Ace, and his Blood gets Burning.....that's Fireblood. Spirit. Haki. Luffy has the Disposition of a King like no other, and *every time he uses Red Hawk*, we get flash ups of Aces face.

And what does Tama say when she sees Luffy use Red Hawk, after only having met him once?

*it reminds her of Ace*

......wait......
........do you hear that?..........
.......   its....its a.....RUMBLE.........

**GOD ENEL, descending from the sky, sitting atop his golden throne, on ""Pluton"", ""Ark Maxim"", a legion of automata in flying craft flanking him, one foot up, a bored look on his face, his head leaning on his hand, muttering**

**""Huh? Are the Humans fighting? How noisy...no matter. Die.""**

""***RAIGO***""

*a ship with the power to wipe out an island with a single blast*

*a ship that Franky will recognize, that HE and Iceberg, some of the most amazing shipwrights, wondered if it was even possible to build*

*an Ancient weapon that was not buried in Alabasta, that was just JoyBoy's middle finger at Im, for he knew he would look, and instead left it in the hands of its creators (or at least carriers.....): the Master Shipwrights of Water 7*

**Skypiea**

**Water 7**

fjr9f5,PlagueComics,[THEORY] Roger's Devil Fruit,"I think the question of ""What is Roger's devil fruit"". Well, I thought about it a bit, and I have an interesting theory. As we all know, in One Piece, a treasure isn't something like gold...but something that holds value to a specific person. Now, in One Piece, you don't see treasure chest often because of this fact, but when you do, the treasure is usually big (the Tamate Box or whatever its called). Now, let's go back years and years...to the very start of the story. Shanks (a man that was in Roger's crew, and holds the same value) is in the east blue. He has inherited his straw hat from roger. It appears that's not the only thing inherited from Roger though. ANother item he has is that is notable is a treasure box. One of the few seen in the series, and inside of it is the Gomu Gomu no Mi. Shanks isn't the type to care about gold or anything, so the fact that the Gomu Gomu was inside of the treasure box means that it had some kind of personal value to him. The Gomu Gomu no Mi is Roger's fruit. What use does Shanks have for carrying this devil fruit around? He cares none for gold, so he probably would not sell it, if his intention was to give it to his crew, or for him to eat it himself, don't you think he would have done that once he had gotten it?

&amp;#x200B;

Just like how Luffy wanted to preserve Ace's devil fruit, Shanks wanted to preserve Roger's devil fruit, both in order to prevent the power of somebody special to them from going into the wrong hands.

fjqwwx,TheGreatGod42,What are the best One Piece arcs to watch?,"So I've recently been catching up on the One Piece manga currently. Considering I am only 100 chapters away from the final chapter, I wanna ready myself for the dreaded ""weekly chapters"". So to keep myself busy I wanted to check out the anime. The only problem is I don't have the time (nor inclination) to watch the whole thing, so I'm curious to know that are your guys' favorite arcs of the One Piece anime. It doesn't necessarily have to be anime-only arcs, just Arcs that were well adapted from the manga in terms of pacing, animation etc.   
I've already watched the Impel Down arc animated and I remember it being very good, but I've also heard Fishman Island, Punk Hazard and Dressrossa don't get handled very well in the anime. So what are your recommendations?

Both can definitely take responsibility and lead. Nami handles all the money and navigation and Sanji took control of the Kitchen during WCI. As a chef he understands the likes and dislikes of the crew which is a way of showing Sanji‚Äôs understanding of each crew member. Plus he‚Äôs been shown to be the more strategic type and is willing to take charge if the situation calls for it. 

In Zoro‚Äôs case I‚Äôve never been impressed with his ability as a leader. He‚Äôs the loner type who kinda does his own thing, however, he‚Äôs great a right hand. Backing up the Captain, giving them advice, etc..

I was reading chapter 974 again and noticed that when the Scabbards are still at the port with Momonosuke, Shinobu is still present, but when Kanjuro identifies himself as the traitor to the rest of the scabbards via the painting he made of himself, she is nowhere to be seen.  


We last saw Shinobu holding back Momonosuke at the port but then, \*pop\*, there is Kanjuro holding him.

[\*pfft\* this paint-editing tho.](https://preview.redd.it/ras51skvn2n41.png?width=1001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23cbac5a6f796ef5f3a3fde3a951f7ca1bd0e061)

2. Possibly Shanks son or Kaido's son? There are theories going around as well that Shanks is the son of the Rocks Captain, who supposedly also has red hair. Kidd has features that give a resemblence to the silohuette of Rocks D. Xebec, but his eyes also remind me of Kaido.

3. Just a character of the worst generation like luffy and law, who don't stay down after getting socked.

fjlmr1,Lambo256,Toki's Prophecy for the 9 Scabbards after latest chapter,"Before I get into the post, here's Toki's prophecy:

&gt;You are the moon unaware of the dawn  
&gt;  
&gt;May your purpose be fulfilled  
&gt;  
&gt;**And cast nine shadows on the night woven of 20 years**  
&gt;  
&gt;And you shall know the brilliance of the dawn

The 9 shadows is seemingly an obvious reference to the 9 Red Scabbards, but now that we know &gt;!Kanjuro is the traitor,!&lt; does it still refer to the same people? I have 4 different answers myself:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Toki doesn't have prophecy powers and we shouldn't take this too seriously. She didn't know that &gt;!Kanjuro was the traitor!&lt; and literally meant it in the obvious/straightforward way.
2. &gt;!Kanjuro!&lt; is still playing a role, although not the intended one, thus the prophecy still holds true.
3. It's a reference to the Strawhats (but what about Jimbei?!?!).
4. My personal favorite: Even in the original meaning of the 9 shadows, it had to include Nekomamushi, so we can expect him to come back. I don't think he'll come back empty handed (remember he was trying to recruit the former Whitebeard pirates as allies), which gives us a perfect opportunity to see Izo return to Wano. The addition of Izo and Neko will complete the 9 Scabbards and fulfill the prophecy.

fjkk8c,101_Almagamations,I know almost everyone's talking about the latest chapter but...,"^^^Remember when Oda once thought of pre-One Piece characters having ""sorcery"" powers way back on his ‚ÄúRomance Dawn‚Äù oneshot?

I'm still very glad Oda didn't implement some of kind of ""magic""/""battle aura construct""-esque power system like Naruto and Bleach, or even the ""inherented superpowers"" idea like in My Hero Academia. Don't get me wrong, when done right, a virtually supernatural power system can be phenomenally amazing, it's why I love the concept of Nen in Hunter √ó Hunter and Stand Powers in the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series. Then I see Fairy Tail's own ""power system"" via literal ""skidaddle skidoodle"" magic, by which then it just feels pretty mediocre, to be honest. I don't know why, but I can always sense there's something wrong with it. Even Bleach's power system is far more interesting, even though I feel like it's all over the place.

In conclusion, I definitely prefer Devil Fruit abilities and Haki for One Piece. Try to imagine One Piece characters having Nen abilities. Though it may sound fucking awesome, I doubt it will ever work for a story like One Piece. This is also because I really love how, theoretically, **ANY** One Piece character can achieve Yonko-level strength. In fact you don't even **NEED** a Devil Fruit to become a Yonko (ala Shanks).",18,1584363577,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fjkk8c/i_know_almost_everyones_talking_about_the_latest/,OnePiece,1

fjh3rd,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 24: Usopp Arrives!,"Yes, this is my first time reading One Piece

We start off this chapter with Nami saying they need more supplies. Luffy once again says they need food, which makes me think the next crew member will definitely be a chef with how many times they‚Äôve mentioned needing one. Nami also says that they need a better ship, which is true and is the whole purpose of this next mini arc. Being short on crew members is also true, and I feel like Luffy will get one or two more before entering the Grand Line. So then we meet Usopp, who even more than the other three crew members so far, wears his personality in his appearance. Look at this guy for more than 5 seconds and you can instantly tell he‚Äôs a prankster and a liar. I think the nose gives it away more than anything, it just radiates a kind of lying energy (no offense to any long noses out there) as does the rest of his attire. Side note that whoever Yoroshiku is, it‚Äôs cool they tell us about Usopp possibly being a play on Aesop.The ‚ÄúBoy Who Cried Wolf‚Äù similarities (which I‚Äôll get to in a second) are just too big to ignore, but it never feels like Oda is trying to rip that story off, just convey the same lesson. So yeah, Usopp goes to the village, lies about pirates and then runs away. It‚Äôs a classic ‚Äúboy who cried wolf setup‚Äù and inevitably pirates will actually show up and Usopp will realize his fuckup. We get to see that Usopp has a little fake pirate crew, which is interesting to me. Why pirates? It feels like Oda definitely picked it for a reason, especially because Usopp offers to go with Luffy later this chapter. It‚Äôs clear he has some motivation to be a Pirate, and we‚Äôll probably get to see why later in the story. 

&amp;nbsp;

A third boy shows up and basically tells Usopp that Luffy has shown up. Usopps whole interaction here hammers home another important thing about him, he‚Äôs kind of a bitch, which is fine, if I saw Buggy‚Äôs flag I wouldn‚Äôt be running down to fight him, it‚Äôs just something that I think might be important later since Oda emphasizes it here. Maybe he intertwines the theme of ‚Äúthe boy who cried wolf‚Äù and ‚Äúbravery‚Äù in some way, maybe by having Usopp actually face whatever pirates will inevitably show up. I do have to say that one thing I miss about the forest of judgement is that it provided some variety to the location, but it‚Äôs fine having mostly small sea towns until Grand Line, which will probably introduce more exciting locations. Usopp gets caught, lies his ass off, and then gets called out for it. It seems that Luffy likes Usopp a little, although I doubt he‚Äôll be joining the crew (I‚Äôll explain why in a sec). He‚Äôs also apparently really prideful, but that could just be more bullshit he made up on the spot. We cut to all of them in a bar, where Usopp explains that the only person who could give them a boat is sick and has no parents, which again, Oda why are these minor character backstories so tragic. Anyways interestingly enough it‚Äôs not Luffy who objects first, but rather Nami who says they can‚Äôt ask for a boat. It‚Äôs only interesting because up to this point we‚Äôve mostly seen Luffy as the guy who takes charge emotionally, so Kayas backstory might have some ties to her own problems (losing a loved one close to you?). Usopp offers to join their crew as captain, and seeing as all of them refuse i'm guessing that Usopp probably won‚Äôt make the cut as a crewmember, but it‚Äôs also possible there could be more to his character than meets the eye. The chapter ends with Kaya asking to see Usopp, meaning they probably have more of a relationship than Usopp is letting on, what that relationship actually is, is yet to be seen. Overall I enjoyed this chapter, it‚Äôs a good introduction to this village and Usopp is a fun character for me, as I love the goofy comedy characters the most. I‚Äôm also interested in seeing where all of these plot threads go, as this arc has the most up in the air at once so far.",7,1584343916,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fjh3rd/one_piece_journey_chapter_24_usopp_arrives/,OnePiece,1

fjfw4n,Ukeee,"What if, Kanjuro is a double agent?","So I was reading /u/OharaLibrarianArtur chapter analysis, specifically #12 and thought of this.

I kinda have a theory on why Kanjuro did not commit seppuku over Yasuie's death. It's because Yasuie never died. My explanation is probably a stretch but here goes:

I noticed Yasuie's name is similar to how you would say Jesus in eastern languages; Iesu in Japanese or Yesu in Chinese. This is further strengthened by the fact that he was crucified before being executed, not sure if it's common style for execution in Wano though. Now how would Yasuie have escaped death? Well turns out Kanjuro knows how to draw, proven how he tricked the other Scabbards with his ink double. Now who's to say he didn't do one for Yasuie? He even went as far as to burry Yasuie himself which kinda raised the question, did he really burry him or did something else instead, like maybe hid Yasuie in a safe place? Now I'm just waiting for the whole, rose again after three days to happen.

Then recently, Orochi mentioned how scary Kanjuro was with his acting that he would actually receive the same punishments as the other Scabbards which prompted me with, what if Kanjuro was actually serious about it, that he was in fact a double agent? What if Oden's commitment and resolution turned Kanjuro the other way as he realized that the Kozuki family wasn't the bad guys.

Well that's just my theory though, its probably way off and wrong.",5,1584337038,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fjfw4n/what_if_kanjuro_is_a_double_agent/,OnePiece,1

fjfs6i,Boundman101,Regarding Kanjuro...,"Kanjuro despite being the second of the scabbard to be introduced and being a part of the story for longest(after Kinemon) was never given much focus. Kinemon was a big part of PH, Raizo was the main focus of Zou, but all Kanzuro was apart of was a small side story in an already dense deressrosa arc.¬† He was always in the backgrounds, an irrelevant side character almost, which now i realize was on purpose.

Now what is Kanjuro's character supposed to be? The answer i have come to conclusion is""Nothing"". He doesn't have a character. The only life he knows is the one lived on stage pretending to be someone else. He laughes when it is appropriate, cries when required and harbour no ill will towards other ""actors"" in the stage that most people call life. He plays the part of traitor becoz that is the role bestowed upon him and when it is time to reveal himself he has an evil face on as now it is the time to play the ""bad guy"" role. This is most brilliantly depicted when he meets orochi and he has the form of a blob that has no definite dimentions and can change shape according to the ""vessel"" that he is put in. He is willing to die to fulfill the role he is playing and i think that is the most brilliant part of his reveal. Simple but brilliant.

Now regarding the future of his character, i think it will be intresting to see the way his character goes now that he is releaved of the role of the character. Will he take the role of the evil guy and die fullfiling the role or will he have a redemption arc and sacrifice himself for the alliance. Whatever happens¬† i think his death is definately in the cards.",31,1584336451,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fjfs6i/regarding_kanjuro/,OnePiece,1

fjexpw,rasouddress,The Will of D and what that potentially means for certain characters,"Tekking made a video not too long ago where he postulated that once a D's ""role"" in the destruction of the current WG era has been completed, they die with a smile on their face. Looking back on the D's we've known, it does appear to fit reasonably well. Roger's death signaled the great pirate era that would bring about the beginning of the end. Ace's death motivated Luffy and really built the government up to be the end game boss, as well as Blackbeard. Teach can't really get out of this alive and is hard to picture *without* a smile. Xebec (assumed to have died I believe?) set the stage for the relationship between Roger and Garp, ensuring Ace's influence on Luffy. Oden is not confirmed to be a D, but sure seems to have the calling card.

This raises some questions about the future. As many have speculated, Luffy is probably going to die at the end. Many question the whole ""quickly shortening lifespan"" plot point that has seemed to have gone unspoken for a long time. 

Also, what are Garp's and Dragon's final roles? Dragon obviously needs some kind of payoff to his existence, so him having some role in an upcoming arc is pretty much a given. If this trend continues, however, Garp seems like a given to die in a battle almost parallel to the Paramount War --this time, he makes the right decision (the one he couldn't make before-- and saves Luffy's life, resulting in his own death. That is extremely speculative, obviously, but if the idea that his role has not been completed yet is to be believed, it would make a lot of sense with his personal story.

Trafalgar D. Water Law is the person who most seems to be set to follow this trend. Obviously, he cannot be the Pirate King, his main mission of revenge for Coraz√≥n has been completed, and now the only thing keeping him working really seems to be his alliance with the Straw Hats, something he could easily have just reneged on once his real goal was complete. With no real purpose at this point other than the fact that he is a fan favorite, I feel that he is giving off serious ""I only still exist to be a later plot point"" vibes. Why else would he stay? He even straight up told Luffy that he was dissolving the alliance and he ended up going back on his word because ""reasons."" It feels like someone so discerning and goal-oriented wouldn't just wander the seas for no reason unless Fate was revealed to have a heavy hand in him remaining with the alliance. If this is true, the question then becomes, ""For what purpose does he die smiling?""

Obviously other people have brought up the idea of dying with a smile on your face, but the idea that these roles ARE DIRECT CAUSES of the death doesn't seem to have too much refuting evidence, even if the supporting evidence is on the weaker end. It makes me worry for some of my favorite characters, but it also makes me excited to see what grand scheme Oda has in store for that last heartbreaking panel where Luffy smiles.",2,1584332190,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fjexpw/the_will_of_d_and_what_that_potentially_means_for/,OnePiece,1

So next week, chapter 975, and being the last chapter with 5,7,9 it will surely have the biggest and unforseeing reveal.

What if, Ener was on Onigashima ? Maybe captured by Kaido when he arrived on the blue sea.

We always see Onigashima hit by the thunder.

Furthermore I don't think Luffy, Kaido, and Law can win against Kaido. But with Ener added it would make a great ally. 

Also I don't think Ener will come back as a bad guy thanks to his travel on the Moon, je has more compassion and feelings than before (thanks to his soldiers).

Why would Kaido need Ener ? Maybe he is used by Vegapunk via is demon fruit to create a weapon (needs more energy).

fjdqqx,Scopper_Sanji,Who is the richest Kingdom apart from the Celestial Dragons?,"An interesting thought, because we have all these different royal families but who exactly is the wealthiest. Alabasta seems to be economically poor as 1 Billion Berries was a massive amount for them and Dresrossa collected 10 Billion despite it crippling the kingdom. Then we have the Bourgeois Kingdom (Cavendish‚Äôs ex kingdom) who gave him 500 million berries when they exiled him. Also the Vinsmokes increased Sanji‚Äôs bounty by 50 million themselves and they are depicted to be incredibly, incredibly wealthy because of their scientific gadgetry and warmongering. So who has the richest kingdom?

Personally I think the Germa Kingdom is the wealthiest non celestial dragon kingdom. They can afford to craft hi-tech suits for them and their army. War mongering is booming for them considering how much money they got for the Broccoli Island war. Also their castles are enormous and not too mention they can be anywhere they want which means their warmongering reaches everywhere. And as we all know war is extremely profitable for some.

So I was thinking, who takes down Akainu? Well, in the series, there's probably a few characters who have a beef with him, but the two would be Luffy and Sabo actually!

&amp;#x200B;

My prediction is that Sabo will be the one who fights Akainu, using the same Fire fruit that Ace couldn't beat him with, but maybe it'll be augmented by either Awakening or Haki and then Sabo can get revenge for his brother that he couldn't save before.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe Luffy will have a hand in it, but it's very possible Luffy has another fight going on with someone bigger.

Later in a conversation Coby got with X Drake he said he was Worried cause he saw CP0,  Coby said what could they be doing in Wano, and Drake said probably making some internal deals.

The world Goverment is probably buying or trafficking weapons for them or other people, they are preparing for War.

Oden said the reason the borders remained closed was to protect Wano fro a very Big power. Probably Marigoise secret Weapon. 

By the end of this arc by reading the poneglyphs we will learn something terrifying and if Luffy is the person Roger and Oden were waiting for, Luffy wont be able to protect Wano if he is heading for Laugh Tale.

fjau4r,dannydankwood,"Theoretical Explanation for Haki, Devil Fruit, Seastone, and the True History (re-uploaded for edits and accurate title) (Necessarily Lengthy)","As always, long post. To explain and understand Haki, Devil Fruit, the Void Century, and any and all of One Piece, you need the key, insane background that Oda has made so clear, but so esoteric.

*Inherited **Will**, the tide of the times, peoples **Dreams**; as long as people peruse the meaning of **Freedom**, these things will never die!

My treasure? You can have it, but you'll have to search the whole world to find it...I left everything in that place, **One Peace** *

Oda gave it ALL away RIGHT here.

**Haki**

- God is Will, he is Spirit, and he is King
- God made Yggsrasil, on Earth, garden of eden, with huge Spirit
- Yggdrasil made Poseidon and Uranus, the Seas and the Sky
- Poseidon birthed the Sea Kings, Uranus birthed Zou
- The Seas, water, is life itself, and the blood in Yggdrassils veins (global roots)
- From these, all Mythical land and sea creatures were born
- From these, all species and life was born
- The Souls/Spirit of living beings go into it when they die, and are reincarnated in another of their species
- An ever-decreasing amount of Spirit in each living thing, but every living thing has Spirit
- The 'Voice of all Things' is the voice of Spirit, of Will, and of Kami
- The stronger your Spirit, and the closer it is to the Disposition of the King, the more you can bend reality to your Will, influencing your Luck and Destiny
- Only those with Advanced Colour of the Conquerer can even hope to have a strong enough Spirit to speak the Voice of all Things, normally spoken by Gods, and Ancient, Mythical beings
- Similarly, the stronger ones Haki is, *especially* if they have the Disposition of the King, it can lead to **Advanced** Armament and Observation Haki: one can project their vision so far, and so well, they can even see the future, and one can project their physical 'Spirit' so strongly, they can coat themselves in protection, and even PROJECT this force outside of their bodies

**The Cataclysm**

- Angels were not allowed on Earth, and got jealous of being the lowest on the Spirit hierarchy
- Wanted Justice, to overthrow God
- So they figured out how to create pure 'Spirit', and called it 'Pyrobloin' (Pyro+Bloin, Fireblood, 'Burning Blood', Haki, Spirit, Ryo, Mantra
- They make an Ark, and crash on Earth
- The core of Pyrobloin surged into the Earth, and took the 'essense' or 'nature' of every species (lineage factor, DNA) item, element, tool, food, fundamental force (gravity, light, 'Noroma Particles'), weapon, invention, you name it, and all the souls of the dying Birkans, and surged into Yggdrasil: Poseidon, Uranus, Humans, and other life
- The Sea Kings, Kraken, and other sea life largely survived, but genetics all over the globe was changed forever
- Fish + Men became Fishmen, Man + Man became Giant, Sea + Stone became Kairoseki, and when volcanic eruptions still happen on the Sea bed, Pyrobloin is launched into the air, and Sea + Cloud makes Sea-cloud, Island + Cloud makes Island-cloud, the Skypians are oblivious Birkan descendants who live on such clouds, and this is why life has evolved on them strangely
- Dials are shellfish in the Sea Cloud that are affected by the Pyrobloin, and thus come to be Fire Dial, Air Dial, Impact Dial, Sound dial and etc...they're not unexplainable, they're a key clue
- Creates Treasure Tree Adam and Sunlight Tree Eve
- Adam is made of nigh-indesteuctable wood, and was on God Valley, the Emerald City of green, grassy plains that would be bombarded and bombarded by the Humans who came to fill the world, trying to kill the remaining Birkans, who always rebuilt their city under the protection of Adam
- Into Eve went all of the Souls and Essenses, and Eve reincarnated Poseidon into a Fishman, and it would always continue to reincarnate into a Fishman, effectively giving that person the Haki/Spirit equivalent of a God. Hence, Shirahoshi is so large, and can not only speak to Sea Kings, but command them: she has the Haki of *the* 'Sea King', she is not weak-Hoshi, she is strong-Hoshi
- Eve reincarnated all life as normal, bexcept for the Birkans: they were **Devils**, who had defiled the garden of eden, and so from her branches sprouted the **Devil Fruit**, into which she poured all of the 'essenses', elements, objects, animals, and information the large Pyrobloin core had dematerialized
- Im, who used Poseidon to command the Sea Kings to patrol the Calm Belt, who *put a giant hole through the Earth to create Reverse Mountain* at Enies Lobby, and wiped out the Birkans, creating the Void Century, fought Joy 'Dream' Boy, who wanted to unite the races in peace, in order to be the *freest man on the seas*, and this is why Im used his power to create the LARGEST seastone structure we've seen; the prison of Impel Down, and created Mariejois on top of the 'Eve' tree, above Fishman island
- Im (who is actually secretly Vegapunk) thus had control over all Devil Fruit, and documented their existence in an Encyclopedia, and after wiping out the Birkans, spent the next 800 years reverse-engineering their technology: gigantification, the bizzare weather and look of islands on the grand line, extracting the lineage factor from animals and making his own Devil Fruit (smiles), he went from island to island, experimenting, even if it meant the island being destroyed
- He worked with Ceaser, on Punk Hazard (named because Vegapunk worked there, and it was Harardous, completely off-limits to any pirates except the schichibukai, and Ceaser learned of the 'lineage factor (DNA)', accidentally caused an explosion, and was fired. This island was chosen because it had a HUGE Pyrobloin despot right in the middle of it, and thus when Aokini and Akainu went to fight there, their awakening + this deposit caused the islands appearance to permanently change
- The 'Treasure of Mariejois', is Pyrobloin: is **anything you want to be**
- Doflamingo is the son of Celestial Dragons, the ancient spoiled brat descendants of Im, who left the kingdom because they felt bad due to the 'True History': Doffy HATED this, he was a KING, descendant of ROYALTY, so took up his ancient father's goal...he blackmailed the WG into giving him a supply of Pyrobloin, and kidnapped Ceaser, using his expertise to experiment with gigantification, create the Seastone encasing for the SAD lab for protection, and to work on making his own artificial fruit...SMILES, which he then sold to the highest bidder on the Black Market (where Franky bought Adamwood, as the Black Market is full of technology and secrets forbidden by the WG), and thus, the WG accidentally created the Kaido/Wano situation, as Kaido himself is a Dragon reverse-engineeted from the Dragon-Dragon fruit, whose life was saved by Linlin, as he was rescued/recruited by Xebec
- Vegapunk/Im tried to make Dragon fruits with this, but it failed...Momonosuke is Uranus, and thus can hear the Voice of all Things, and who the Fruit WORKED on, because his Spirit alone could mould and reform the shoddy DNA into the right thing
- JoyBoy failed in the First Great War, but was friends with some of the Kingdoms: Water7 made Pluton out of Adamwood for Im, but kept the plans, just incase another would ever needed to be made, and the WG, who always thought the Master Shipwrights might keep it, would for 800 years try to bribe them to give the plans back, but JoyBoy told them of the 'True History', which would be passed down with the plans, and Tom thought Roger might be the 'D' prophesied to take down Im, and thus used Adamwood he had saved to build Roger's ship, the WG came back to take him, and tortured and killed him to give the info (Im could do so easily), and thus went back to PROPERLY get it from Iceberg, who gave them to Franky, and lo and behold: the TRUE 'D' did come, Luffy, and Franky burned the ancient plans, and Im saw the Straw Hat of JoyBoy, of Roger, and grew worried
- JoyBoy also went to Wano, which had PyroBloin in its volcano, and thus were master craftsman and Spirit warriors, with Advanced knowledge of Haki, still called Ryo there, as JoyBoy had them make the Poneglyphs out of indestructable Seastone, to spread the 'True History' over the world and prepare for the coming 'D' who would inherit his Dream and defeat Im
- Wano has a HUGE Pyrobloin deposit in it's volcano, which is why the Wano people have such strong Spirit, and are such masterful Seastone craftsmen. They even invented the Cursed Swords, which are imbued with varying degrees of Pyrobloin. This is why they 'drain the Haki' (spirit/Fireblood/Pyrobloin) of the wielder, and store it. As such, the stronger the swordsman, the stronger the cursed blade they can wield. It will keep storing Haki, growing ever stronger, until it absorbs so much it becomes a PERMANENTLY Black Blade. The mightier the 'Grade' of the blade, the more cursed it is, and the higher the power ceiling of it. 
- Joyboy rescued Poseideon, earning the eternal friendship of the Fishmen, but could not fulfill his 'Promise' to unite them with the surface, although he DID have Noah built of Adamwood, to carry them from their Islands Destruction in the future, and carry them to the air: Luffy will fulfill this, when the Final Great War happens at Mariejois, and destroys the Red Line, uniting the World, creating the All Blue (as it was before the Cataclysm), and achieving One Peace of all races
- Roger learned of AAAAALL this, learned he was 20 years too early, but knew Im thought it was HIM to fulfill it, and what did he do? *he laughed*. He told Whitebeard and Oden he would start the Great Pirate Age by turning himself in, and with his dying words, would propel Luffy towards his Destiny
- This is why Oden KNOWS the borders must open
- Whitwbeard recognized it was Luffy at Marineford, and THIS is why he didnt save Ace...with his strong Observation Haki, he could see that by saving Ace and Himself, he would stop Luffy from activating his Colour of a King, and so he let Luffy 'save' Ace (was emotionless and grave when Ace was about to die), and again, when Ace is struck down, he feels the pain of SACRFICING A SON, a SON that ROGER HIMSELF had entrusted to Whitebeards protection, lest he be the one to satisfy the 'D', and asked him, WAS I A GOOD FATHER? and Ace replies, OF COURSE YOU WERE. His heart ready, Whitebeard accepted his death, and, like Roger, gave Luffy the push he needed, even if he was in shock and unresponsive: ONE PIECE, DOES EXIST
- This is why Im has made it forbidden to learn of the Void Century, the Poneglyphs, and the Ancient Weapons...as we as controlling Seastone, he put a Marine base before each entry to Reverse Mountain. And thus, including the Calm Belt, he could separate the World enough to never put all the pieces together: he used the OpeOpe to make himself immortal, as well as his son Mihawk, and used Bonneys fruit to continuously de-age his 5 most trusted leaders, the Gorosei...but now both have been largely lost, although Bonney has been 'recovered' by Akainu before BlackBeard could steal her fruit for himself (you'll understand soon)
- Eneru learned all this on Birka, a Skyisland that was the last vestiage of this long-forgotten past...and he was MAD. He took the strongest fruit they had, which was what the ancients used to call Kami, the Thunder-Thunder fruit, recruited the strongest to be his Priests, and DESTROYED BIRKA, went to Skypiea, and enslaved them to make the ARK MAXIM, a second Ark, to return him to Heaven: Fairy Earth. THIS is why he had Observation Haki strong enough, combined with his fruit, to not only SEE AND HEAR OVER AN ENTIRE COUNTRY, BUT TO SEE HOURS INTO TJE FUTURE: HE IS URANUS
- He even has an AWAKENED LOGIA, due to his insanely strong Conquerors Haki, and chose his fruit as such, and it was FATE that made Luffy able to stop him, and DESTINY that will bring them together again. This is why Skypians have wings that point up, they are Angels: Birkans, including the Priests, and Eneru, have wings that point down, they are fallen Angel's. Fallen from Gods grace. So Eneru did as the Birkans FIRST did: decided to be God. He cut his wings off, and replaced them with a circular, Pyrobloin/Seastone band, adorned with drums, so that when he taps them with his Devil Fruit Lightning, the wavelength reverberates through it and amplifies.

**Devil Fruit**

- Each Devil Fruit has the Soul/Spirit of a Birkan in it, along with an 'essense': to eat a Devil Fruit you become an '____ human', because you become 'The Essense + Human'
- This is why the VERY FIRST BITE transfers the 'power', the Birkan soul immediately goes into that vessel
- You will, however, explode if you eat more than one, because no living being is strong enough to contain more than one additional Birkan 'Soul', before their bodies explode from the sheer energy
- This is why Devil Fruit users are 'cursed by the sea': the Ancient and old blood of Yggdrasil, the very life-blood of the Earth itself, will reject you, thinking you are a Birkan Devil
- This is why 'Seastone' drains the strength of a Devil Fruit user: it 'emanates the same energy as the Sea', because it is literally the Sea + stone, not simply stone originating from the Sea
- Eve reincarnates these Fruit SoulPowers into other fruit, and thus, Burgess was attempting to kill Sabo and steal his Fruit by it going into a fruit into his bag, but that's NOT how Blackbeard 'stole' Whitebeards 'Fruit'
- This is why when someone has VERY strong 'Haki', such as the Colour of the King, they have very stront 'Spirit', or Burning Blood, FireBlood, Pyrobloin
- As your 'Haki' wavelength increases in strength, it pushes up the wavelength of the Birkan Soul within a Fruit User, increasing its power tremendously
- This can lead to 'Awakening', also known as Enlightenment (there was one such Human on Earth during the Cataclysm: the Buddha, and this is why there is a 'Buddha Buddha' fruit, 'Human Human' fruit, a 'Jacket Jacket' fruit, and a 'Surgery Surgery' fruit: it's just every single thing
- This is why there are Mythical Zoans, but the Mythical creatures died in the Cataclysm, and are extinct, and THIS is why there can never be a 'water water' fruit or any sort of Ocean Zoan: the Sea protected the Life in it from being killed and 'broken down' by the Cataclysmic Pyrobloin explosion
- When one has Conquerers Haki, strong enough to influence *even the world around the user itself*, THIS is why an 'awakened' user can *change the world itself with their Devil Fruit power*
- The Yami-Yami no Mi is the **strongest Logia** because it enables the user to attract anything, Light, Pain, and *even devil fruit powers*, and thus, when someone dies, a YamiYami user can technically attract the *dying Fruit users Soul and Spirit itself*, including the Birkan Soul and its Power
- This Soul and Spirit would normally kill someone who already had a Fruit 'Power', but the YamiYami user, similar to Caribou's SwampSwamp Fruit, can *store an infinite amount of things within themselves*, including the Soul and Spirit, and thus, be 'made of' both 'powers'. THIS is why Teach said to Luffy that SKY ISLAND DOES EXIST, and A MANS DREAMS NEVER DIE: *he knows the True History*, and wants to be the D to achieve it, and so he has stolen the Devil Encyclopedia, originally stolen by Xebec, and inherited his will (ship is called the Saber of Xebec): to be King of the World, but he fears death, and isn't a King, so in the Final Great War, he will realize this, and sacrifice himself to allow Luffy to achieve it, and to win, and he will die with a smile on his face
- The D are not enemies of God, only the *self-proclaimed God of Im*
- Eneru will return for the Final Great War (HYPE)

Final Great War will be 
- Luffy, with his entire Strawhat Fleet (Im will be FURIOUS), every race and species
- Blackbeard, with his massive fleet of monsters
- Eneru, with an army of automata
- Im, with the Gorosei, Fleet Commander, Admirals, and entire marine force
- Dragon, with the revolutionary army, descended of the Shandians, and waiting for the coming time, fighting in secret through all of history

You can probably figure out a LOT, if not ALL, of the One Piece world and story, from the information I have given alone, and I am attempting to write up and do so. I believe this is the insane, crazy, yet perfectly consistent world that Oda has created. It's all symbolic: there are no good or bad guys. This is why Rayleigh tells Robin, ""who knows, maybe you'll come to a different conclusion than us"". Even they thought it seemed crazy, but Im is just doing the same as the Birkans, the same as Eneru, the same as Doffy, the same as Kaido, the same as Fisher Tiger, the same as Hody, the same as Crocodile....everyone wants **power**, to be **King**, to rule over all. ONLY Luffy, and JoyBoy, had the pure, Kinglike disposition to simply want FREEDOM. The pain and cycle of Hatred in Humanity is always due to GREED.

*Inherited **Will**, the tide of the times, peoples **Dreams**; as long as people peruse the meaning of **Freedom**, these things will never die!

My treasure? You can have it, but you'll have to search the whole world to find it...I left everything in that place, **One Peace** *

People think he meant 'one piece' as in all the treasure in one place, or that it's called 'One Piece'...by pursuing his 'D'ream, Luffy would find and achieve One Peace, by travelling the WHOLE WORLD, and become King of the World, a God...and he will refuse it. Because he got his Dream, the be the freest man in the world.

Teach mentions that he feels twice as much pain as a normal person, maybe that's because when a normal person would black out from pain, Teach can't so he's forced to feel every agonizing second.

How can you knock out someone who can't be knocked out? Teach will just keep getting back up, over and over and over again, there'll be no end to it.

fj8u8c,dannydankwood,"Haki and Devil Fruit, explained in detail","**Haki**

- God is Will, he is Spirit, and he is King
- God made Yggsrasil, on Earth, garden of eden, with huge Spirit
- Yggdrasil made Poseidon and Uranus, the Seas and the Sky
- Poseidon birthed the Sea Kings, Uranus birthed Zou
- The Seas, water, is life itself, and the blood in Yggdrassils veins (global roots)
- From these, all Mythical land and sea creatures were born
- From these, all species and life was born
- The Souls/Spirit of living beings go into it when they die, and are reincarnated in another of their species
- An ever-decreasing amount of Spirit in each living thing, but every living thing has Spirit
- The 'Voice of all Things' is the voice of Spirit, of Will, and of Kami
- The stronger your Spirit, and the closer it is to the Disposition of the King, the more you can bend reality to your Will, influencing your Luck and Destiny
- Only those with Advanced Colour of the Conquerer can even hope to have a strong enough Spirit to speak the Voice of all Things, normally spoken by Gods, and Ancient, Mythical beings
- Similarly, the stronger ones Haki is, *especially* if they have the Disposition of the King, it can lead to **Advanced** Armament and Observation Haki: one can project their vision so far, and so well, they can even see the future, and one can project their physical 'Spirit' so strongly, they can coat themselves in protection, and even PROJECT this force outside of their bodies

**The Cataclysm**

- Angels were not allowed on Earth, and got jealous of being the lowest on the Spirit hierarchy
- Wanted Justice, to overthrow God
- So they figured out how to create pure 'Spirit', and called it 'Pyrobloin' (Pyro+Bloin, Fireblood, 'Burning Blood', Haki, Spirit, Ryo, Mantra
- They make an Ark, and crash on Earth
- The core of Pyrobloin surged into the Earth, and took the 'essense' or 'nature' of every species (lineage factor, DNA) item, element, tool, food, fundamental force (gravity, light, 'Noroma Particles'), weapon, invention, you name it, and all the souls of the dying Birkans, and surged into Yggdrasil: Poseidon, Uranus, Humans, and other life
- The Sea Kings, Kraken, and other sea life largely survived, but genetics all over the globe was changed forever
- Fish + Men became Fishmen, Man + Man became Giant, Sea + Stone became Kairoseki, and when volcanic eruptions still happen on the Sea bed, Pyrobloin is launched into the air, and Sea + Cloud makes Sea-cloud, Island + Cloud makes Island-cloud, the Skypians are oblivious Birkan descendants who live on such clouds, and this is why life has evolved on them strangely
- Dials are shellfish in the Sea Cloud that are affected by the Pyrobloin, and thus come to be Fire Dial, Air Dial, Impact Dial, Sound dial and etc...they're not unexplainable, they're a key clue
- Creates Treasure Tree Adam and Sunlight Tree Eve
- Adam is made of nigh-indesteuctable wood, and was on God Valley, the Emerald City of green, grassy plains that would be bombarded and bombarded by the Humans who came to fill the world, trying to kill the remaining Birkans, who always rebuilt their city under the protection of Adam
- Into Eve went all of the Souls and Essenses, and Eve reincarnated Poseidon into a Fishman, and it would always continue to reincarnate into a Fishman, effectively giving that person the Haki/Spirit equivalent of a God. Hence, Shirahoshi is so large, and can not only speak to Sea Kings, but command them: she has the Haki of *the* 'Sea King', she is not weak-Hoshi, she is strong-Hoshi
- Eve reincarnated all life as normal, bexcept for the Birkans: they were **Devils**, who had defiled the garden of eden, and so from her branches sprouted the **Devil Fruit**, into which she poured all of the 'essenses', elements, objects, animals, and information the large Pyrobloin core had dematerialized
- Uranus went into a Human, and eventually Im

**Devil Fruit**

- Each Devil Fruit has the Soul/Spirit of a Birkan in it, along with an 'essense': to eat a Devil Fruit you become an '____ human', because you become 'The Essense + Human'
- This is why the VERY FIRST BITE transfers the 'power', the Birkan soul immediately goes into that vessel
- You will, however, explode if you eat more than one, because no living being is strong enough to contain more than one additional Birkan 'Soul', before their bodies explode from the sheer energy
- This is why Devil Fruit users are 'cursed by the sea': the Ancient and old blood of Yggdrasil, the very life-blood of the Earth itself, will reject you, thinking you are a Birkan Devil
- This is why 'Seastone' drains the strength of a Devil Fruit user: it 'emanates the same energy as the Sea', because it is literally the Sea + stone, not simply stone originating from the Sea
- This is why when someone has VERY strong 'Haki', such as the Colour of the King, they have very stront 'Spirit', or Burning Blood, FireBlood, Pyrobloin
- As your 'Haki' wavelength increases in strength, it pushes up the wavelength of the Birkan Soul within a Fruit User, increasing its power tremendously
- This can lead to 'Awakening', also known as Enlightenment (there was one such Human on Earth during the Cataclysm: the Buddha, and this is why there is a 'Human Human' fruit, a 'Jacket Jacket' fruit, and a 'Surgery Surgery' fruit
- When one has Conquerers Haki, strong enough to influence *even the world around the user itself*, THIS is why an 'awakened' user can *change the world itself with their Devil Fruit power*
- The Yami-Yami no Mi is the **strongest Logia** because it enables the user to attract anything, Light, Pain, and *even devil fruit powers*, and thus, when someone dies, a YamiYami user can technically attract the *dying Fruit users Soul and Spirit itself*, including the Birkan Soul and its Power
- This Soul and Spirit would normally kill someone who already had a Fruit 'Power', but the YamiYami user, similar to Caribou's SwampSwamp Fruit, can *store an infinite amount of things within themselves*, including the Soul and Spirit, and thus, be 'made of' both 'powers'

You can probably figure out a LOT, if not ALL, of the One Piece world and story, from the information I have given alone, and I am attempting to write up and do so. I believe this is the insane, crazy, yet perfectly consistent world that Oda has created, and is why we all love it so much.

#Bets and Bravery!

Another exciting ~~4 month hiatus~~ betting period has come and gone, and it's time to look over what all happened with regards to the show during Kozuki Oden's legendary flashback!

While I did make the excuse that I couldn't really ask many questions during Oden's flashback since we already knew much about what would happen by the end of it (such as Oden scarring Kaido, his boiling, Toki's timeskip, the formation of the Scabbards, among much more), I 1) didn't expect it to last 13.5 dang chapters and 2) didn't expect to see anything regarding Roger and Whitebeard until either the end of the Wano Arc once peace had been restored or until we got closer to Laugh Tale. But, at the end of the day, Oda has surpassed his storytelling abilities yet again with this latest flashback, telling quite possibly some of his best material regarding the legend Kozuki Oden himself and his adventures in Wano and beyond. It's only making both the resolution regarding the 20-year conflict with Orochi/Kaido and the 800 year Void that much more exciting, and I don't think I'm the only one who can't wait to see what else Oda has in store.

So, without further ado, let's get right into the flashback results!

#The Kozuki Oden Results

##The Kozuki Oden Payouts

Because we haven't had an actual new betting thread, everything here with regards to payouts is all going to be from Newly Resolved Bets, for which we have quite a few to chronicle! So, without further ado, let's get started!

##Newly Resolved Bets

###Bet 190 From the Chapter 917 Edition

Is the Kozuki Clan truly righteous like Momo and Co. suggest or are they evil like Orochi says?

With Wano's history now brought to light, the rumors of the ""evil"" Kozuki family turned out to be just that, rumors. 20 years of propaganda will do that, I suppose. Orochi, using his powers as Shogun of Wano, led the people of Wano to believe that his becoming ruler saved the country from the evil Kozuki Family. And while the Kurozumi Family was unfairly treated and hunted down for the sins of only a couple of its members, the Kozuki as a whole have also been unfairly treated by history. 

I've heard many a theory regarding the resolution of this arc having the welcoming back of the Kurozumi Family into Wano's ruling class with both sides learning to stop blaming unrelated members for the sins of their fathers. It's sad to say that everything wrong that's happened with Wano in the past 20-odd years has been the result of revenge warfare brought on by unfair treatment, but perhaps Shogun Momonosuke will be able to reunite the country as one. **Outcome A for Bet 190 is correct!**

###Bet 211 from the Chapter 921 Edition

Will the Kaido Assassination Plot be exposed before the planned execution?

As we'll discuss a little later, a certain someone did happen to expose the plan to take Kaido's head to the Beasts Pirates and Orochi's forces prior to the planned time. As a result, the samurai allies of the Kozuki were cut off and the Scabbards themselves were ambushed by Beasts Pirates warships en route to Onigashima. Only time will tell if the battle will continue at Onigashima or back on the Wano mainland. **Outcome A for Bet 211 is correct!**

###Bet 231 from the Chapter 925 Edition

Will Kid team up with Luffy to fight Kaido?

As a fellow prisoner in the Udon Mines, Kid and Luffy made an unlikely team for their short while together before the two were broken free thanks to ~~O-Lin's~~ Big Mom's breaking-and-entering and subsequent brawl with Queen. While Kid left the prison with his first mate, Killer, in tow, it was only a matter of time until we'd see the supernova enter the fray again.

As it turns out, Kid's crew meeting an unknown fate at the hands of Kaido's crew and Killer's subordination at the hands of the SMILE fruit were all the motivation he needed to join hands with the Strawhat Alliance and fight Kaido. For the first time since the slave auction house at Sabaody, the three most prominent captains of the Worst Generation united in an offensive at sea against the Beasts Pirates, coming to the aid of Oden's Scabbards. When you're at sea, you fight against pirates! **Outcome A for Bet 231 is correct!**

###Bet 286 from the Chapter 937 Edition

Since Zou, theories have been around that there was a traitor or mole inside the forces opposing Kaido and Orochi. Theories from one of the Minks ~~to everyone who attacked future Strawhat Carrot, apologize before I do to thine ass what Jack did to Zou~~ to even one of the Wano samurai. Could the stoic leader, Kin'emon be a traitor? What about Raizo himself? Inuarashi? Nekomamushi? Or, as clever detectives perceived, was Kanjuro the mole?

Since his first mention as Kin'emon's ally who sacrificed himself to allow Kin's passage to Punk Hazard to save Momonosuke, Kanjuro has appeared as an ally to the Strawhats since Chapter 700. 274 chapters later (28% of the story's current runtime), Kurozumi Kanjuro revealed himself as not only a traitor but also a family relative of the evil Kurozumi Orochi! Born in a theatre troupe and immediately persecuted by lynch mobs for merely sharing blood with the Kurozumi bloodline, Kanjuro was scouted by Orochi to become a Kozuki mole as part of his plan to assume the throne and, since then, has acted on behalf of the Kurozumi Clan. 

The immediate reaction is to despise this traitor. After knowing him for over 1/4 of the story, the largest betrayal in One Piece history is sure to bring a lot of hatred to the samurai, but let's think rationally. Born without a place in the world, Kanjuro was raised to hate everything the Kozuki stood for through allowing continued persecution of the Kurozumi bloodline. Beyond that, while he was allied with Orochi, Kanjuro did fight alongside Oden and his fellow Scabbards for over a decade. We have to ask, how much of Kanjuro's ""persona"" was a persona? Where does his true allegiance lie? Could Kanjuro be in a similar situation to how Pudding was midway through Whole Cake? While I don't believe Orochi can be forgiven except possibly by Momo (and even then, I give it a 10% chance of happening), I can definitely see Kanjuro being swayed by his Kozuki allies to fight for what's righteous. Regardless, I'm very excited to see the next confrontation between Kin'emon and Kanjuro and the legendary fight that will take place! **Outcome A for Bet 286 is correct!**

###Addendum to Bet 310 from the Chapter 943 Edition

Will Port Tokage's meeting be uncovered by Orochi's forces?

I'm just daft and actually resolved this previously by saying an incorrect outcome was indeed correct. We previously knew that the meeting at Port Tokage was prevented by Orochi's forces, but now we know how he was able to do so: Kanjuro's information. **Outcome B for Bet 310 is correct!**

###Bet 311 from the Chapter 943 Edition

Will Orochi regain the trust of his men after Yasuie's execution?

Thanks to information provided by Kanjuro, Orochi was able to regain the trust of his men. That's about it, not too nuanced a bet. **Outcome D for Bet 943 is correct!**

###Bet 337 from the Chapter 949 Edition

Will the return of Oden's Scabbards be relayed to Orochi?

Aside from their initial sighting months prior when Raizo, Kanjuro, and Kin'emon left Wano to seek out Inuarashi and Nekomamushi on Zou, the return of Oden's Scabbards was just a fleeting rumor to Orochi and his forces. However, with the return of Kurozumi Kanjuro, Orochi's fears were confirmed as the mole relayed information regarding not only the return of the time-traveling team but also the assurance that the other members were alive and well. However, we have yet to learn whether or not Orochi and Kanjuro know anything about Denjiro assuming the role of Kyoshiro, so this could be an interesting turn of events! **Outcome A for Bet 337 is correct!**

###Bet 342 from the Chapter 951 Edition

What are Kid and Killer's course of action now that they're free from Udon?

Since their departure from the Udon Mines some 40-odd chapters ago, we'd yet to see anything about Kid and Killer. However, with our return to the present time, we've seen him return to action alongside two fellow Supernova in Law and Luffy to fight the Beasts Pirates and rescue the Scabbards. With this, we can infer that Kid and Killer are declaring war on Kaido alongside the Strawhat Alliance to avenge their fallen crewmates! **Outcome D for Bet 342 is correct!**

#End of Kozuki Oden Payouts

And with that, we've come to the end of the payouts for this edition. However, we're not done with the results thread just yet, we've got more in store for you all!

Oden's a chad, Orochi's a bitch, Roger and Whitebeard are total bro's, Buggy and Shanks should definitely form a crew now that Buggy's not a Shichibukai, everything about the final voyage was a nut, and we still have no fucking clue what's going on with the Void Century or the One Piece or why it's so damn funny ~~who names an island after a funny story they read in a book once?~~ 

All I can say is that this was undoubtedly the best flashback in terms of worldbuilding and that Oda's really doing a great job of hyping up Wano and beyond. I'm more excited to continue reading with each and every chapter!

That's about all I have to say personally this week, so thanks for listening!

Or was he disguised as Shinobu and revealed himself once his painting copy disappeared? If it‚Äôs the latter, did Shinobu ever exist in the first place, meaning Kanjuro had always disguised himself as her? Or maybe he only started doing it after the 20 year jump and we still haven‚Äôt seen present day Shinobu? Or maybe he just disguised himself as her for this chapter only?

fj7prm,dannydankwood,Wano + Latest Chapter (974) Explained,"I reckon Kozuki family 800 years ago made the poneglyphs for JoyBoy, and promised to keep the borders closed until the time prophesied time came.

The Kurozumi clan, betrayed this great leader, and turned over Joy's secret, and thus the countrymen have hated them evermore, even though the Kozuki line is the same as the Monkey line, and thus is always kind, unjudging, and incredibly powerful. Kaido knows, so he found Orochi Kurozumi to use as a shadow-leader, and steal the country from the WG, who are understandably furious, as it's their source of Seastone. Wano has a HUGE Pyrobloin deposit in it's volcano, which is why the Wano people have such strong Spirit, and are such masterful Seastone craftsmen. They even invented the Cursed Swords, which are imbued with varying degrees of Pyrobloin. This is why they 'drain the Haki' (spirit/Fireblood/Pyrobloin) of the wielder, and store it. As such, the stronger the swordsman, the stronger the cursed blade they can wield. It will keep storing Haki, growing ever stronger, until it absorbs so much it becomes a PERMANENTLY Black Blade. The mightier the 'Grade' of the blade, the more cursed it is, and the higher the power ceiling of it. Mihawk (an immortal son of Im), uses one such huge, 'Supreme Quality' blade, and long ago made it Black, as he has similarly incredible Haki to his 800 year old father. THIS is why he was almost known as 'Clairvoyant' Mihawk (Oda changed it to HawkEyes, less of a giveaway, but cmon guys, look at their eyes); he has Colour of the Conquerers Haki - a Kings Disposition, inherited from his father. All CoC basically not only makes other Haki types stronger, but bends reality to your will: observation haki can be pushed to see even into the future, and armament/hardening can be strengthened until you can project your 'Spirit' (Haki) itself into the environment. Advanced CoC is when you bend ALL Spirit, ALL Life, to your side: Luck, Fate, the Winds and the Seas, and reality itself become your command. THIS is why Mihawk feels out of place: he has wandered the Seas, bored of his Royal Heritage, and finding someone strong enough to challenge him. THIS is why he recognized Luffies 'greatest strength' at Marineford: the RAW strength of his Kings Disposition.THIS is why Kaido and Big Mom are nigh invincible: they both fought with Rocks, and have incredibly King-like Haki. So did Whitebeard, and thus, all 3 became Yonkou in pursuit of what Rocks failed in: becoming World King. Not Pirate King, because Whitebeard knew that he was strong enough to become that, but also knew from Roger that another 'D' was going to be the one to achieve both goals, and recognized that in Luffy. CoC is what FUELS Awakening, because as your Spirit/Haki strength starts to become monstrous, it amplifies the 'wavelength' of your 'devil fruit', which is just the Birkan 'Spirit' + the power it got combined with and stuck with. This allows Awakening, new heights of power, and a fruit to influence THE WORLD AROUND IT. THIS is why Doffy didnt understand that Gear 4: Python WAS awakening: Luffy was already unconsciously unlocking it, just like he did in Marineford. His RAW Spirit is insane. EVERY LIVING THING HAS HAKI/A SPIRIT, HUMANS can have the strength of a GOD, if only their Disposition is like that of 'a King' (more accurately, THE King, Kami), but very few have enough Will to have Haki, let alone to get to that strength. Sea Kings and Zou have INSANE Kings Haki, which they got from the original Cataclysm that created the devil fruits (birkans crashing into earth with Pyrobloin, smashing Yggdrasil, and creating the Adam and Eve trees), and that's why if your Kings Haki is strong enough, if you are AWAKENED (Enlightened) enough, you can speak 'The Voice of all Things', as Roger and Oden did, and as Luffy did. Whe JoyBoy made the poneglyphs 800 years ago, because he knew he would lose the Great War against Im, he went to Wano, the greatest Seastone craftsmen in the world. The World Government had enslaved them, forcing them to close their borders, and provide manual labour, forging Seastone for them, which they exclusively controlled. However, the original Kozuki betrayed rhe World Government, made the Poneglyphs, and closed the border forever, stopped the WG from ever getting to the Pyrobloin, and abusing it. This huge deposit is why WANO WARRIORS have so much SPIRIT, and raw strength; their warrior culture evolved from the Haki emanating in their country, and thus over time, they mastered it quite well, although they called it something else: Ryo.

I have thinked two ways this cant happens.

You need to kill all the crew... Wich is not only not easy to do, Luffy woundt allow it. But if that happened at Sabody with Kuma Luffy would have probably quit from being pirate king and just go around the world feeling guilty.

The other method luffy alredy said what it was to Ussop,  you basically need to spoil Luffy what the one piece is.

fj6e79,sombrero69,About the whitebeard pirates,"Even though the whitebeard pirates were the first yonko crew we have seen (red hair pirates don't count) we don't know that much about them, most of the fandom only remember the names of the top 5 commanders and recently Izo.

It is funny to think about that after 10 years of the marineford arc ending we now know more about izo than all of the WB pirates bar oden and ace, we only learned of the devil fruits names of marco and jozu recently but blamenco and rakuyo's flail supposed fruits names we still know nothing about. we also don't know what most of their divisions do.

&amp;#x200B;

A refresher on the 16 commanders:

* **Division Commander #01**: [Marco the Phoenix](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Marco) Medical division maybe
* **Division Commander #02**: [Fire Fist Portgas D. Ace](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Portgas_D._Ace) 
* **Division Commander #03**: [Diamond Jozu](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Jozu) Combat division
* **Division Commander #04**: [Thatch](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Thatch) (deceased) Cooking division maybe
* **Division Commander #05**: [Flower Sword Vista](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Vista) Swordsman division
* **Division Commander #06**: [Blamenco](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Blamenco)
* **Division Commander #07**: [Rakuyo](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Rakuyo)
* **Division Commander #08**: [Namur](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Namur)
* **Division Commander #09**: [Blenheim](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Blenheim)
* **Division Commander #10**: [Curiel](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Curiel)
* **Division Commander #11**: [Kingdew](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Kingdew)
* **Division Commander #12**: [Haruta](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Haruta)
* **Division Commander #13**: [Water Buffalo Atmos](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Atmos)
* **Division Commander #14**: [Speed Jiru](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Speed_Jiru)
* **Division Commander #15**: [Fossa](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Fossa)
* **Division Commander #16**: [Izo](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Izo)

We barely know anything about commanders 6 to 15, even their powers aren't that expanded upon. take 12th division commander haruta for example, we know he's strong but how? he doesn't have a flaming sword like fossa or a DF like blamenco but he at least got a unique design looking like a kid, 9th division commander blenheim while strong looking doesn't stand out in any particular way either. 11th division commander King dew or He-man as tekking likes to call him, we haven't seen this guy even talk i think but he's probably all about punches.

Some of the other commanders that we don't know much about but at least we have smth to work with like blamenco who i'm interested to see fight and see what other weapons he can pull out of his pockets, speed jiru has one of the most unique weapons in the op world where he has a joust and a shield and he lives up to his epithet by being fast, Rakuyo has another interesting weapon which is a flail with a spiked ball at its end that has teeth and the head seems sentient but doesn't look like any animal. curiel has a cool design with his dual pistols and bazookas, namur is the only fishman on the moby dick, i wanted to see him fight but unfortunately we didn't get much of him. namur most likely joined the WB pirates when WB made FI his territory, i feel like it was a missed opportunity to not have him take part of the FI arc.

i hoped to see thatch in the latest flashback but looks like he joined much later.

there is no point to this post i just wanted to talk about the WB pirates and speculate what their powers or fighting styles be and what the divisions they lead would be about. also who is your favorite commander from 5-15?",13,1584298590,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fj6e79/about_the_whitebeard_pirates/,OnePiece,1

It's because he is truly God Usopp, but the biggest reason is that his Observation Haki far transcends Katakuri/Enel/Luffy at the same time all combined.

fj4yxd,G_STAR_4LIFE,I think in Oda's mind Sanji has to be made into a complete joke at least once in every arc.,"Let's be honest guys Sanji's portray has been dragged through the mud Oda constantly uses him as a hype tool to make the bad guys look good, but I dont mind that because Sanji's goal isnt to become the Worlds strongest anything's, he just wants to find all blue and be a chef. What I am frustrated about is how Sanji has to be the ""butt"" of every joke. Look I get it, Oda likes to use Sanji for comedy; I like Sanji and his gag moments but sometimes Oda goes too far with the gags to the point where it really hurts Sanji as a character. 

1)Did Oda really have to make the Sanji nose bleed gag an important plot-point for the Fishman Island arc?
Yes I know that the whole point of Sanji almost dieing was to highlight the racial tensions and the whole blood theme, but come on! Couldnt he have done it in a way that doesnt make Sanji look like a complete joke! I mean...it is now Canon that Sanji almost died of a nose bleed! Think about that for a second. 

2) Sanji saying he had found his all blue when he met the mermaids. I remember thinking this was the end of Sanji's character when I read that chapter. Are you honestly telling me that the dream Sanji has had as kid is comparable to seeing some sexy mermaids? It just makes Sanji's dream look cheap compared Luffy and Zoro. I'm not going to lie, I did laugh and I probably could have brushed it off as just a funny joke, bu my then Oda had to....Remember when he said to chopper he'd rather turn around and fulfill his dream of looking at Shirahoshi even if it meant death. That was was Oda injecting more comedy to give us a funny moment, but at the cost of what? He didnt need to trample on Sanji's dream of all blue again.

3)Absalom vs Sanji. Initially, the premise for the fight was strong: Sanji's anger at how Absalom had been sexually harassing Nami and Robin was palpable and had been established several chapters prior, and he was trying to stop Nami from being unconsciously wed to the same perverted bastard. Here we had a great asswhupping to start off the fight as Sanji unleashed his justifiable anger at Absalom's actions and clearly established that even though he too was a pervert, he still wouldn't go so far as to molest, harass, and claim women like Absalom did. Kicking off Absalom's invisible bazookas as a setup for Sanji knowing what Devil Fruit he had was also pretty cool, as was the reveal that Sanji had wanted this fruit all along....then it started going downhill.
Sanji futilely trying to give a reason for wanting the Suke Suke no Mi other than peeping on girls in the bathroom wasn't too bad in and of itself, since it worked with his personality, but then Oda started trying too hard to inject more comedy into the battle with the four(!) consecutive reaction shots from the same minor zombie, as well as Sanji suddenly giving up on his dream to attain the fruit's power for the sake of another reaction shot. On top of that, the fight-ending exchange felt extremely underwhelming - Absalom stabs Sanji with a knife for some reason, then Sanji grabs his leg and hits him with a barrage of kicks that 1. embeds him in the wall in the Jesus pose, and 2.¬†doesn't even completely defeat him. And of course the one-liner at the end involves Sanji mentioning peeping one last time.",27,1584293503,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fj4yxd/i_think_in_odas_mind_sanji_has_to_be_made_into_a/,OnePiece,1

fj4pbs,PapaaGanja,Theory on redeeming the traitor (SPOILERS!!),"Theory on Redeeming Kanjuro

Okay. Hear me out. What kanjuro did was sorta irredeemable in some sense. Oden took you in, and Orochi. Everything he did it to save everyone else, even if it was selfish (in the fact that he wouldn‚Äôt let anyone else in on his burden causing the downfall of Wano) and stupid, it was for the simple reasoning of an apology. Which fits perfectly in why kanjuro might begin to feel.

Okay, now that I got basic logical issues presented there is a deeper story being told here. Oda has gone on record to say that most of the characters in one piece are below average real world intelligence. It‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs a story after all there has to be liberties taken. 

I only say all of this before hand because right after the chapter I struggled with this thought because on one hand it‚Äôs perfect. All the themes Oda has been trying to set up could coalesce in Kanjuro Kurozumi the red-scabbard. On the other how could you redeem the guy who fucked over oden so badly. Unless oden wouldn‚Äôt care and would forgive him anyway. Which is the guy we have seen.

What themes has Oda been setting up? Family bloodlines vs family through bonds. Traitors on both sides. Forgiveness or leeway possibly. Preparing for a new dawn or future. I‚Äôm sure there are more but these are the most prominent. 

Alright. I think we saw oden‚Äôs backstory to see how he walks own path, then we saw the dancing even though it most likely would never work and he could have possibly won. I think he did it because he wanted to apologize to the Kurozumi‚Äôs. His family fucked up but he wants to have a brighter future that includes everyone. So he dances for 5 years hoping Orochi might have even the smallest bit of remorse and change or actually leave.

I think Kin and the rest of the scabbards are going to hate kanjuro but he is going to actually begin to feel emotions, he is going to be the real Heir to the Kurozumi‚Äôs after Orochi and after watching Ohara‚Äôs recap hearing about how kurozumi also means black ink. It would perfect for the new kurozumi clan to began from a devil fruit user who draws.

I‚Äôve mentioned feeling emotions multiple times now, but honestly it‚Äôs going to be a huge part of it. I‚Äôve acted a lot in my life, and the number one skill you must have is empathy. You have to understand where the character is coming from. Now the thing you could say is he is a sociopath, but [Joys and sorrows, but hating none of you](https://imgur.com/gallery/mgF2B4h)
This panel shows us foreshadowing for actually feeling bad. Imagine the sad piano music with the soft flute while kanjuro realizes how much he fucked up and just then he turns the tide of the battle, and then Toki‚Äôs prophecy doesn‚Äôt get fucked up also.

Last thing. Toki‚Äôs prophecy says that all nine red scabbards are going to be there. Unless toki is completely fucking useless and even messes up the prophecy! Kanjuro has to at least fight on the scabbards side one last time even if he isn‚Äôt redeemed.

fj4l6z,PapaaGanja,Theory on Redeeming Kanjuro,"Okay. Hear me out. What kanjuro did was sorta irredeemable in some sense. Oden took you in, and Orochi. Everything he did it to save everyone else, even if it was selfish (in the fact that he wouldn‚Äôt let anyone else in on his burden causing the downfall of Wano) and stupid, it was for the simple reasoning of an apology. Which fits perfectly in why kanjuro might begin to feel.

Okay, now that I got basic logical issues presented there is a deeper story being told here. Oda has gone on record to say that most of the characters in one piece are below average real world intelligence. It‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs a story after all there has to be liberties taken. 

I only say all of this before hand because right after the chapter I struggled with this thought because on one hand it‚Äôs perfect. All the themes Oda has been trying to set up could coalesce in Kanjuro Kurozumi the red-scabbard. On the other how could you redeem the guy who fucked over oden so badly. Unless oden wouldn‚Äôt care and would forgive him anyway. Which is the guy we have seen.

What themes has Oda been setting up? Family bloodlines vs family through bonds. Traitors on both sides. Forgiveness or leeway possibly. Preparing for a new dawn or future. I‚Äôm sure there are more but these are the most prominent. 

Alright. I think we saw oden‚Äôs backstory to see how he walks own path, then we saw the dancing even though it most likely would never work and he could have possibly won. I think he did it because he wanted to apologize to the Kurozumi‚Äôs. His family fucked up but he wants to have a brighter future that includes everyone. So he dances for 5 years hoping Orochi might have even the smallest bit of remorse and change or actually leave.

I think Kin and the rest of the scabbards are going to hate kanjuro but he is going to actually begin to feel emotions, he is going to be the real Heir to the Kurozumi‚Äôs after Orochi and after watching Ohara‚Äôs recap hearing about how kurozumi also means black ink. It would perfect for the new kurozumi clan to began from a devil fruit user who draws.

I‚Äôve mentioned feeling emotions multiple times now, but honestly it‚Äôs going to be a huge part of it. I‚Äôve acted a lot in my life, and the number one skill you must have is empathy. You have to understand where the character is coming from. Now the thing you could say is he is a sociopath, but [Joys and sorrows, but hating none of you](https://imgur.com/gallery/mgF2B4h)
This panel shows us foreshadowing for actually feeling bad. Imagine the sad piano music with the soft flute while kanjuro realizes how much he fucked up and just then he turns the tide of the battle, and then Toki‚Äôs prophecy doesn‚Äôt get fucked up also.

Last thing. Toki‚Äôs prophecy says that all nine red scabbards are going to be there. Unless toki is completely fucking useless and even messes up the prophecy! Kanjuro has to at least fight on the scabbards side one last time even if he isn‚Äôt redeemed.

TL;DR Kanjuro realizing his mistakes and how oden would forgive him anyway would cause him to begin to feel emotions right at the peak of the battle. Which would be the perfect symbolic turning point bringing odens death back in a meaningful way.",4,1584292116,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fj4l6z/theory_on_redeeming_kanjuro/,OnePiece,1

fj48pk,ahood34,Xebec and the Darkness Logia,"First off, years ago I remember a ton of people speculated that Roger may be a rubber man, and that Shanks was carrying around his fruit as a memento of his late captain when Luffy ate it. However, Luffy has interacted with so many people who knew Roger and none of them have said like, ‚ÄúWow, that is Roger‚Äôs power‚Äù so we can be sure that Roger wasn‚Äôt a rubber man. 

Now I‚Äôm starting to hear that Xebec may have had the darkness logia and he is subconsciously controlling Blackbeard to obsess over the fruit, leading him to kill Thatch. However, I feel like if Xebec did have the darkness logia then Garp, Sengoku, or Rayleigh would have said something. They all saw him display it in front of the world at Marineford. I feel that would illicit a reaction if they had seen that power before.

fj3o8b,neilnoahbanares,[Wano Arc] 975 Prediction and Chronology of events,"As we move close to **Chapter 975**, I want to share some of my predictions and for those of you who are confused on the movement of the story I have made a chronology of events to better understand the situation of the **Ninja Pirate Mink Samurai alliance**

**PREDICTIONS:**

* **DENJIRO help's LAW escaped**
   * Law's Dialogue: If letting me escape is part of some grand plan of yours, then I'll go along with it.
   * We know Denjiro has some grand plans while X-Drake is just feeding information to WG.
   * Silhouette of foot is plain and no straps just like X-Drake 2 belt like strap
   * Orochi told to Torture Law and it seems that Yakuza's are good at it over X-Drake
   * Denjiro has better interest in letting Law escape over X-Drake since if X-Drake let Law escape, sooner or later it will be reported to Orochi/Kaido and he needs to escape Wano for good. unlike Denjiro that waited 20years for this siege to be favorable in his plan.
* **KID saw the Alliance gathered in Neko Harbour in KIBI**
   * Kid's Dialogue: There is a lot of Samurai and boats waiting like idiots on the opposite port.
   * We all know that the **Neko Harbour at Kibi (North of Wano**) is the opposite of **Tokage Harbour at Udon (South of Wano)**
   * Geographically speaking, it solves most of their problem
      * it is near at **Itachi Harbour  at Kuri** which was attacked night before the siege.
      * **O-Chou (Yakuza)** having hard time to travel the weapons since **Ringo-Hakumai bridge was destroyed**, thanks to **Kibi-Ringo bridge since it is not destroyed**
      * it could explain why Luffy told Kinemon **""Sorry were a little late""** since they came up to Kibi which is way farther than the original meeting place.
* **NEKOMAMUSHI is already with Strawhat**
   * We need to complete the 9 scabbard panel (and including Shinobu as 9th)
* **DENJIRO and LAW freed the 1,000+ Samurai**
   * Hours before Orochi's departure, Denjiro made his plans on the move.
   * Either Law use Room to swap the Jailers and Prisoners or they use force to make it happened. 
   * It is a waste of military power if they leave those 1,000+ samurai in place.

fj3ay2,ComradeCornflakes,"If both sides went through with the wedding with no ulterior motives, Sanji would probably have become Big Mom's favorite son (in law)","Considering how much Big Mom seems to appreciate his cooking, he would probably get a lofty position in the Big Mom family with Pudding as his wife. 

Plus from what we were shown, all of Big Mom's kids are terrified of her when she goes on a rampage and Sanji is now a complete solution to that giant problem. If it became known that he was responsible for keeping Big Mom from destroying the island, then the people of WCI would appreciate him and the rest of Big Mom's family would at least respect him. 

Granted, Sanji would still be miserable but he also is cunning when it comes to stuff like this. Maybe he could use his new influence to manipulate Big Mom into helping Luffy in Wano. That or basically control Big Mom through his cooking and become the actual ruler of Whole Cake Island behind the scenes.

fj37s8,thomazambrosio,A parallel between Attack on Titan and chapter 974,"Hey everybody. Obviously OP spoilers and AOT spoilers as well

&amp;#x200B;

So, last chapter we finally got confirmation that Kanjuro is the traitor, being actually a Kurozumi. It was pretty strongly hinted already, but with this info I remember a scene on the first season of AOT. When the Female Titan first appears, she attacks the scout and Reiner is captured by her, but manages to escape. Later we learn that they are actually comrades, and that she let him escape.

  
This reminds me of Dressrosa. Why tf didn't they kill Kanjuro when he was left behind? He wasn't captured at all, he was never in any risk there and they were supposed to find him all along. Of course, is not like anyone knew except for Kaido and Orochi, but consider their connections with Doffy, I wouldn't be surprised if he was aware of it as well and was instructed not to hurt him. It's all speculation of course, but I do think its related.

From the get go he was raised as a marine and later promoted to the secret organization sword. Many have speculated about drakes role at wano, with how everything has unfolded it is highly unlikely he will continue to serve kaido.

So is Kuma secretly a spy or traitor to the government?? Because Zoro should be dead. I don't know why Zoro isn't dead.

The Strawhats just beat Moria. It was an extremely hard fight, so they're all exhausted and can barely move. Then Kuma, *another* 7 Warlord shows up. His boss says the Strawhats are a threat to order, and an insult to the world government. They can't just let them continue to disgrace the government, because they're taking down government organizations 1 by 1. So Kuma's boss tells him to kill everyone who's a witness to Moria's defeat. 

Kuma then comes down, and shows off his stuff. He's super powerful, as a 7 Warlord should be. The Strawhats and company stand no chance, as they should. They barely survived facing one Warlord, they shouldn't be able to beat a fresh Warlord immediately after. 

Kuma says he'll kill them all. Then after seeing their conviction, he says he'll spare them as long as they give him Luffy's head. This makes sense for him. Luffy's the big boss of the whole thing. He's the one who has 1 v 1'd every warlord and god the crew has met. He's the leader and the symbol. Kill Luffy and the whole noise will just die down. Everyone obviously refuses, so Kuma sets off a big bomb.

Everyone's alive... for some reason. Zoro can even fight back. Zoro says to take his head instead. Kuma agrees. This is a really dumb idea for Kuma. Without Zoro, Luffy and the gang can still bounce back and continue fighting the government. Unlike without Luffy, where it would all lose momentum and fizzle out. But I guess Kuma has a huge sense of honor.

Zoro's barely alive after fighting Brooke's shadow, getting directly hit by Oars multiple times, and by Kuma's bomb attack. All of this in 1 day. So how the hell is he alive after enduring all the pain Luffy went through, condensed? Kuma meant for that to kill him. That was the whole point; Kuma will only leave if Zoro dies. He *heavily* implied Zoro would die, and Zoro was completely willing to die.

Was Kuma lying about killing them all, though he's a ""dog of the military"" and his boss directly told him to kill every witness to Moria's defeat? Is he a spy or traitor? 

If he's not, then what's the point of the Warlords? How are they supposed to be taken seriously, if they can't kill one man, who is willing to die, after taking near death injuries? The Strawhats already had tremendous plot armor, being more durable than every building in the Grand Line, but Zoro's fine after all that? Why should I ever worry about the Strawhats, or be intimidated by any of their enemies, if Zoro is fine after all that? Why should I give in to any sense of danger, or suspense? Does the government even care they're being slowly whittled away, cause it seems like Kuma doesn't. Zoro doesn't even have a devil fruit, he's just a really strong human.",34,1584282050,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fj1zvb/first_time_watching_thriller_bark_is_kuma_a_softy/,OnePiece,1

fj1kaz,ImmaIvanoM,How Zoro's swords work (and general misconceptions around Swordsmanship) [spoilers],"Enma is 21 great grade sword that, as stated, drains excessive amounts of Haki from the user. Enma does not give the user power they do not have.

Zoro as seen Dressrosa was slicing up Pica's golem body with his haki clad swords. This by default shows Zoro can already cut that cliff in Wano if he uses haki and any sword he wants.

The difference between these two situations is that Zoro WANTED to cut Pica and he did, while in Wano Zoro WANTED to just cut a tree and he ended up cutting a whole Cliff. This right here is what makes Zoro a failure as a swordsman in this sense.

During Alabasta we get a very clear breakdown of what a good sword and and good swordsman is. When a swordsman makes his sword only cut what he wants to cut is when they, the swordsman and the sword, are actually good.

This is demonstrated on numerous ocassions.

Zoro gains the abilty to cut steel WHEN he tells Wado Ichimonji to not cut the leaves and the sword doesn't. The same way his master failed to cut a paper because he chose to not cut the paper.

Zoro argues with Sandai Kitetsu when it cuts too deeply into people the same way he argues with Enma for drawing out too much of his energy

Zoro uses Shusui for the first time and draws out too much power and fails to properly execute an attack he learned in Skypiea and then comments that he has to master the sword which is similar to what he said about getting used to Enma.

Swordsmanship follows intent. Zoro isn't a betrer swordsman for UNWILLINGLY cutting a cliff WHICH HE COULD ALREADY DO. He is a worse swordsman for letting his sword do what he didn't want to do. Or at the very least, he's just not a good enough swordsman to use this particular sword.

Therefore when Zoro trains himself to become strong enough to STOP THE SWORD from taking his power unwillingly, the entire Haki draining thing will cease to exist. Enma will function exactly the same way as every other sword Zoro has, the same way it did exactly the same amount of Damage to kaido when Oden used it.

We know that after Kaido is defeated,someone needs to protect wano after the SH's leave their country. The nine red scabbards you say?

Momo will be that intimidating force. But how? He is just a kid with a defected DF. How can he protect wano? Once Kaido is defeated,I think his long wish of dying will be fulfilled and will die at the end. What abouthis DF? It will get transferred in the best suitable vessel nearby. And who else is a dragon in Wano? Momo is going to be the new vessel of the dragon fruit. Once he gets that fruit,he should be intimadating(not strong but intimidating) enough of enemies.

fiybfp,LeftQueef,Do you think that the one piece has anything to do with the red line?,"It's kind of obvious that the red line isn't a natural phenomenon. It's like at some point in the void century, someone used a devil fruit or ancient weapon to make the seas so dangerous and untraversable that it's impossible for someone to rule the entire world with no resistance. 

The entire world is made up of tiny islands, and then there's just a huge, useless, unnatural chunk of land that's big enough to create entire continents. 

Do you think that the one piece would unite the seas by getting rid of the red line and connecting the lands, and therefore maybe get rid of the calm belt? It would make sense as to why no one knows what the one piece is. Roger could get his hands on ancient weapons and invincible devil fruits if he wanted. The only reason why no one knows what the one piece is, is if he never used it. Gold and other treasures without a use can't even be called treasures in front of him. He definitely wouldn't destroy the red line and give the world government the opportunity to truly take over the world when he was close to dying. 

If the red line disappeared then it would definitely expand the all blue if it exists. 

The only actual info we have about the all blue is that waves from it deposit salt onto the roofs of water 7 once each year. That doesn't confirm that the all blue currently exists though. It could just be the sea currents from the 4 seas converging once a year to create a tsunami.

All we know is that it's a legend, and although it has definitely existed, I don't see how the 4 seas could be connected with the red line dividing them in half all the way around the world. If the all blue does currently exist, then it exists in a tunnel that goes under the red line like the one used to pass under the red line into fishman islands. 

If none of this makes sense and it has a lot of flaws, don't worry about it. I'm just a drunk man writing down his thoughts so that I can think about them with a clear head in the morning.",6,1584261313,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fiybfp/do_you_think_that_the_one_piece_has_anything_to/,OnePiece,1

Wait... what if all the worst generation members is teasing an appearance by Urouge, Bege, and Bonnie?  Bonnie could show up because of what happened in Mariejois, Uroge followed Kaido after the battle bellow, and Bege is coming because of the Lola side story since Lola might be coming for her mom for all we know.

fix0v2,Love_Shock,On how was Jack able to reach Zou twice...,"With the latest chapter reveal of Kanjuro being the traitor, I think explaining on how was Jack able to reach Zou became clear.

Remember a few chapters back where Oden was talking to his RS about his voyage with Roger in Laugh Tale, he mentioned that the Kozukis and Minks were indeed a sworn allies since a long time ago and if ever they need of help they should go to where they are.

I think that Oden may have requested a vivre card or the former ruler of the Minks gave him a vivre card when they went there for the Road Poneglyph. Oden then gave each RS a piece of the vivre card.

Fast forward to where Momo, Kin, Raizo and Kanjuro jumped 20 years in to the future. Where they were immediately ship wrecked after they attempted to reach Zou were Raizo was then separated from the 3. I think then Kanjuro sent another message to Orochi about Raizo's location together with his(Kanjuro) piece of vivre card.

Then Orochi shared this info to Kaido where he then sent Jack. Remember on chapter 974 that Kaido said to Orochi to not kill them because he wanted to ask them something.

My take back then is that there's no way that Jack and his crew have a vivre card of Raizo. I just didn't have enough evidence to back it up aside from - I don't know if this is anime only or also in manga, the vivre card moves towards to where the location of that person.

On where that vivre card made from is I don't know. But if I where to take a wild guess, Zunesha.

So yeah that's what I think may be the reason on how Jack was able to reach Zou twice.

PS: I'm not sure if this has been theorized before, if so please forgive me. Also first time poster here apologies if I made some mistakes, do correct me if I may have made mistakes on this theory.

fiwoo0,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 22: Judgement Island,"Yes, this is my first time reading One Piece

We start off this chapter with Luffy's hat being fixed. I liked this a lot as a character moment for Nami, it shows that she‚Äôs a good person, but also that she understands the value that Luffy gives to his hat. The chemistry between these three in general is just really well done, the conversation feels natural but is still really entertaining. Luffy and Zoro both need food, and since it doesn‚Äôt seem like any of them know how, I‚Äôm guessing the next crew member will be a cook. Zoro and Luffy find a deserted island, and of course go right towards it. Zoro falls asleep, and Luffy and Nami decide to explore, and end up seeing weird animal hybrids. Why did Oda decide to do this? Beats me, but at least they look cool. My personal favorite is the Bunny Snake hybrid, it‚Äôs such a weird combo, but Oda manages to make it look almost cool. Now we get to the actual ‚Äúforest of judgement‚Äù part of this chapter. Gaimon basically tells Luffy to piss off, or else he‚Äôll face the forest of judgement. Luffy is of course completely oblivious to this warning, and gets shot in the back, which doesn‚Äôt do anything. 

&amp;nbsp;

So now we actually get to meet Gaimon. He‚Äôs a side character so his design doesn‚Äôt really give much more away than ‚ÄúI got stranded on a deserted island,‚Äù with the bush head, the grown out beard and the missing tooth. He‚Äôs been stuck on the island for 20 years, which is actually pretty sad when you think about the fact that he had no one to talk to in that time. Luffy and Gaimon have some common traits, Gaimon says he‚Äôs okay with being a Pirate even if it means putting his life on the line, and like Luffy, also can‚Äôt read a map to save his life (which could explain why he‚Äôs been stuck on an island for 20 years). Then we get to probably the most important stuff in this chapter, more info about the sea Luffy and crew are sailing on. There are 2 oceans in the One Piece universe, separated by the Red Line, and in the opposite direction is the Grand Line. Basically in order to find the One Piece, you have to sail on the Grand Line, and across the Red Line, a route that only Roger has been able to take. So now we have a basic trajectory for the rest of the series, which is nice. But then we get more information about the Grand Line itself. Like everyone else who has talked about it, the Grand Line is pretty much renowned for being extremely dangerous, so much so that it‚Äôs literally called the Pirates Graveyard. All of this is really intriguing, and I‚Äôm excited to see what exactly makes the Grand Line so dangerous. Gaimon tried to explain why the One Piece is probably fake, but Luffy has confidence that it‚Äôs real, I‚Äôm not sure where this confidence comes from, but I guess it might be a result of something with Shanks? 

&amp;nbsp;

Now we get to Gaimons backstory. Much like Chouchous, this backstory is way more tragic than it has any right to be, with Gaimon getting stuck in the chest and his crew leaving him. All that he had left is the treasure, but he could never get it, and so made sure no one else could have it either. It‚Äôs really sad, but it only gets worse afterwards. Nami and Luffy agreeing to help Gaimon out was nice, and shows that Nami does have principles even when it comes to treasure. But this next part is actually one of my favorites in the series so far. In most other manga that I‚Äôve read, this would have been a pretty cut and dry filler chapter about Luffy and Nami helping out some bush dude. But Oda really does try to go the extra step in making this special, and does a fantastic job. Gaimon has lost literally everything in his life, his only meaning was protecting this treasure on top of the hill. So when Luffy launched up and said he wasn‚Äôt going to give it back, I already knew something was wrong. But the reveal of the treasure chests being empty was just crushing. The way Oda handled this entire scene was amazing, and I really appreciate how he went out of his way to make this more than just a side story. Not only is this a great character moment for Luffy, it‚Äôs also a really heartfelt scene for a guy we met and are leaving (probably forever) in the same chapter. The fact that Luffy basically saved this guy from paranoia over his treasure to the point where it became his entire purpose is incredibly well done, and Gaimon telling Luffy to find the One Piece is a great subtle way to show his change as a character. So that was the chapter, I‚Äôll probably end up counting it as part of next arc, so I can say that if One Piece keeps increasing in quality, and has more genuinely moving moments like this then I can‚Äôt wait. Awesome mini chapter, and Luffy and crew are once again sailing for the Grand Line!",4,1584250952,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fiwoo0/one_piece_journey_chapter_22_judgement_island/,OnePiece,1

fiw2y4,treescoffeerain,Theory on Kanjuro's power and Shinobu,"In the latest Chapter, Shinobu is shown standing behind Momonosuke. After Kanjuro revealed that he's the traitor and sliced by Kinemon, the real Kanjuro has captured Momonosuke while Shinobu is gone. Where did she go?

What if this whole time, the current Shinobu is Kanjuro's drawing? OR if Shinobu was Kanjuro drawing on himself to look like her, while the ""real"" Kanjuro has always been his drawing. 

When he was sliced by Kinemon, you can see the emotions in the drawn Kanjuro's face, meaning his DF power can draw things with emotions, feelings, and thoughts. Maybe his powers are way more complicated than we currently know. What is known his that his drawing does not get wet, as seen in the last chapter. Maybe it can only be defeated when it's cut or sliced. 

Here are some inconsistency in Shinobu's character/traitor like personality from the past chapters.

1. The positioning of her sword. She used to carry her sword from left side 20 years ago. Now, she carries her sword from the right. Oda never gets wrong of the positioning of weapons, scars, and marks on a character. Maybe Kanjuro forgot this detail? 

2. Her backstory. In chapter 926, she told Nami that she is scared of sharp objects. But in chapter 970, she is holding multiple kunai in her left hand and even one in her mouth. Since she's a drawing, what if she's saying this to avoid being around sharp objects or being cut?

3. Leaking Plans/Blaming others
In chapter 936, she says ""Did someone leak our plans?"" to Nami and Robin when Hawkins and Drake come to the bathhouse. She points the blame to someone else, when it could be her who leaked the information. 

In Chapter 938, she blames Bepo and the Heart pirates for ""leaking"" their plan. Again, shes playing the game of blaming others to create the idea that she's on the good side and someone else is leaking the information. 

4. Not remembering Yasuie. In Chapter 938, Yasuie asks Shinobu ""Are you Shinobu Chan?"" and she just has a blank face not having a clue who Yasuie is. Kanjuro also has a blank face when Yasuie says ""And you're Kanjuro Kun!?"" 

People have been guessing that Shinobu could've been the traitor. Maybe these two are both traitors or be the same person.",17,1584247673,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fiw2y4/theory_on_kanjuros_power_and_shinobu/,OnePiece,1

fivubw,TheoMurgan,Luffy is possibly connected to the One Piece???,"Just a disclaimer, I have no concrete evidence, it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve been thinking about for the last couple of chapters. Maybe you guys can help add to this idea.

I‚Äôve been trying to think of why Roger laughed at the One Piece. We know it should be some kind of treasure, but why would it be funny enough to name the final island ‚ÄúLaugh Tale‚Äù? In the recent Oden flashback, Oden said to Toko that certain people would come to Wano some 20 years in the future. This is very likely the reason she sent Kin‚Äôemon, Momo and the others 20 years into the future. But how did Oden know Luffy would arrive 20 years later? Did he know of a possible future??? Also, think back to Joyboy‚Äôs promise with the people of Fishman island and their instructions to keep Noah safe until a promised day. But Joyboy is supposedly dead now so how could he fulfill this promise? Did he see someone else fulfill the promise in the future and gave instructions to the fishmen to keep Noah safe until that day?

With the intro of time travel in One Piece with Toko, and Madam Sharley‚Äôs accurate predictions, it‚Äôs not a stretch that there could be a power or item that allows one to SEE THE FUTURE or at least a possible future. And that item (could be a devil fruit) is the One Piece. 

Therefore, the reason Roger laughed is because he saw something funny happen in the future. Luffy is a pretty funny main character. Maybe he saw a future where Luffy did something funny and that‚Äôs why they laughed.

This would explain why Oden knew that certain people (the straw hats) would arrive 20 years in the future since this is after he returned from his voyage with Roger. Or another reason why Rayleigh decided to train Luffy. I would even say this is why Shanks was ready to sacrifice an arm for Luffy for ‚Äòa bet on the new era‚Äô, but now we know Shanks never went to Raftel...maybe someone on the crew told him about it after?

That‚Äôs all I got! Hopefully that makes some sense.",11,1584246455,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fivubw/luffy_is_possibly_connected_to_the_one_piece/,OnePiece,1

fiuhx8,Aoi_Haru,One demon in Kaidou's crew,"Hi guys,  


I had a bunch of theories about Kaidou and the last fight at Onigashima. As you know, that's the island where Momotaro wins his fight against the king of demons (helped by a monkey (Luffy), a dog (Inuarashi?) and a pheasant who asks for kibi dango (Otama?).  


 I was thinking about the four symbols from China, since Oda likes mythology and our boy, Luffy, is pratically Son Wukong. We already have the dragon (Kaidou/Momo), probably the phoenix (Marco), and I was thinking about the tiger (Fujitora?) and the turtle.  


Anyway, I don't really care about that, so I avoided writing about it lol.  


In fact, I'm going to talk about something else, something funnier I think. As we can see, Kaidou truly is some kind of Oni. And he's not the only one, there are a lot of One Piece characters with those strange horns on their head. I'm thinking at Jack himself, Avalo Pizarro and a lot more. One of them was Oars.  


I was watching Marineford saga again, because of the hype for the incoming battle (and to see Akainu punched by Whitebeard). Well, I forgot a fact about Oars Jr. . I don't remember why but I'm pretty sure he was talked to be linked to Wano somehow (maybe since it could be the island where Ace made the nice hat for him?). Well, as we can see watching at his flag, he's Oars III.   


So, the ""theory"" is ... how about an Oars II actually in the ranks of Kaidou, as a number?   


P.S.: maybe Oars body was one of the many things stolen by Gekko Moria when fighting in Wano.",1,1584240192,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fiuhx8/one_demon_in_kaidous_crew/,OnePiece,1

fiu27l,dannydankwood,How Wano will end,"Marking this spoiler becuwse I've 'figured out' one piece, so although I technically don't know for a *fact*, this is what's gonna happen

- Luffy, Kidd, Law, and all of their allies will fight Kaido
- Luffies Haki is going to continue to increase almost exponentially, and all of the powercreep in one piece makes sense
- He will 'awaken' his devil fruit (he already has, he just doesnt know, see: python bouncing in dressrosa)
- They will ALMOST be losing against Kaido
- Blackbeard will show up, fighting ALONGSIDE luffy against a mutual enemy, though they won't SIDE with eachother
- They will kill Kaido, or almost kill him, and CP0 will reveal themselves, Lucci will maybe kill Kaido, or BB will
- CP0 is here to keep the borders closed, as they always have been, because Wano's volcano is the main source of, and this is the key clue which cracked the whole story - *Pyroboin* (aka 'Fireblood', which is pure 'Spirit'/Haki/Ryo) which they use to create and masterfully manipulate kairoseki even better than the WG, as they are the source of it, and the WG keeps them secretly enslaved to provide it to them, hence why only they use it in mass
- BB will 'steal' Kaido's fruit by absorbing his Spirit, along with the Birkan Spirit/Power the fruit put in him, at once
- Lucci will die or escape 
- BB will escape
- Wano will be freed, but the Final Great War is pretty much almost here, as the World Government has fought to keep Wano closed for a reason...the Pyrobloin, and by extension, Kairoseki, is one of the most tightly-controlled WG secrets, and connects everything else they hide, including the mysteries of the Void Century, Ancient Weapons, Devil Fruits, and Haki itself, which all mutually explain eachother 
- Luffy will move on, possibly to Elbaf, which is a completely deserted, 'dead' country


Do you want to know EXACTLY WHY and HOW Alabasta, Skypiea, Water 7, Enies Lobby, Long-Ring Land, Sabondy, Fishman Island (which isnt an island, because the WG has oppressed them and every other non-human species for centuries), Punk Hazard, Dressrosa, Marineford, Wano and Zou connect, along with every other arc, moment, fact, conversation, relationship, and MOMENT in the series?

 If you do, you also have to be ready to have the *rest of the series* spoiled for you, because once you *get* one piece, you'll see why you can 'predict' the outcome of everything: because it's been 'predicted' before...it is destiny

fitlp4,bmtrocks,"I really, really think Katakuri is Kaido's son, and here's why!","I know this is going to be a controversial topic, but looking at it from a narrative perspective it makes a LOT of sense.

Ever since Fishman Island, Oda has been building up this Wano arc with narrative links. Let's look at all the main villains of each post timeskip arc:

Hody powers up with super drugs.
Ceasar creates drugs (SAD and gigantifaction tests) and distributes them to underworld brokers.
Doflamingo rules the underworld.
Jack is a go-between man for Kaido and Doffy (as briefly showcased in Punk Hazard)
Katakuri...????
Kaido is the most valuable broker of all.

See the pattern? So where the hell does someone like Katakuri comes into play in this theme? Its simple.

Katakuri is Kaido's illegitimate son.

Why is this important narratively? Cause Katakuri represents a weaker version of Kaido. Maybe one that existed - I dunno - 20 years before the story started. The one Oden couldnt defeat. So when Luffy triumphed over Katakuri, that establishes that he's truly the man the Scabbards needed. Of course everything isnt perfect here; Luffy had to go through a lot of hurdles including a straight loss against Kaido.

However I think more importantly, Luffy will realize that power isnt going to be everything in this fight. I think more or less everyone is going to work together to beat Kaido, which will be quite different in how he approached his fight with Katakuri.

It also fits into Oda's theme of heritage in the series. Which - to be fair - isnt always about bloodlines. But let's look at all the great pirates...

Roger -&gt; Ace
Dragon -&gt; Luffy
Whitebeard -&gt; Weevil?
Big Mom -&gt; COUNTLESS

And potentially Xebec -&gt; Blackbeard or Shanks

Kaido need a baby boy to match with these great pirates! Katakuri is the man for this plotline.",9,1584236253,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fitlp4/i_really_really_think_katakuri_is_kaidos_son_and/,OnePiece,1

fitdxs,CrimsonKai,Pirate warlords looking for a powerful weapon and grasping the countries theme,"In One-piece there has been a theme that has always repeated, i.e. a powerful pirate warlord takes over a country through deception and power and it is up to the straw hats and some of the country rebellions to fight and overthrow the pirate lord. 
1) In Alabasta arc, we see Crocodile has a reputation of being the Hero, he is a shiichibukai, he is very popular and powerful and he has been a threat to the royal family and the people of the country.He will soon rule Alabasta. The navy are powerless and cannot interfere. Vivi recruits the strawhats, Luffy fights Crocodile for the first time and is defeated, He fights crocodile again and is defeated and he finally defeats crocodile during the third fight. ( I know Crocodile was after Pluton but he would not have minded having a country under him).
2) Dressrosa arc-  This to me seemed more like a what-if scenario- what if Crocodile had succeeded. Don Flamingo is more or less like that. He takes over the royal kingdom, he rules Dressrosa for over 10 years, he creates smile factories and provides powerful weapons to Kaido, countries and other pirates. He too is looking to amass more power.  This time Law recruits them, they fight Don flamingo, Luffy  fights him for the first time, he is pushed aside by his clone, Luffy fights him with gear four but runs out of time, and after he fights him for the 3rd time, he finally defeats him
3)In the Wano Arc, Kinemon recruits the minks, Law and Strawhats to fight Kaido and Orochi. This is more like what if Don Flamingo was not defeated and won against a force like strawhats. The 9 scabbards and Oden are like the strawhats, Oden is similar to Luffy but more mature, mainly and a man who takes responsibility, also a big flirt. His scabbards are more or less like the strawhats(Except for the traitor). Kaido defeats Oden's forces and kills Oden and continues to rule until the latest chapter. He is more or less undisputed. At the beginning of the arc, we see Luffy go all out and is defeated in their first fight. So most likely, we will see Luffy fight Kaido two more times (the second time with the Supernovas and Luffy will be the one to land the final blow on Kaido) and free Wano. 
The whole Pirate warlord, taking over a country has been used 3 times and yes different elements have been added in each arc.
It is more like Kaido inspired Don Flamingo and Don Flamingo inspired Crocodile.
Or you could say Oda was not satisfied with Alabasta arc so he planned to write/draw Dressrosa and Wano and he wanted to try different scenarios and see how they went.
So This what I have observed so far.
There have been many twists and turns in each arc but more or less they follow the same pattern.

fitdk7,ray198999,Spandam,"Oda is indeed a very talented manga author. It's amazing how he can change Spandam from a villainous comic relief character to one of the vilest pieces of work to ever appear in the world of One Piece. For example, in his first appearance, he immediately suffers some slapstick but then goes on to cause Franky's foster father Tom to unfairly get executed and lets Franky get run over by the Sea Train and laughs at what happened afterward. When Spandam makes his present debut, he once again falls victim to comedic abuse such as spilling coffee all over himself, gets mocked by his own subordinates for how he weak he is compared to them, and excuse of performing sexual harassment by Kalifa just existing. However, he quickly reminds the audience of how loathsome he is by going back on a promise to keep the Strwahats safe, taunting Franky over what happened to Tom, brushing off all the possible marine deaths he could have possibly caused by accidentally activating the buster call as ""acceptable sacrifices"", and all the mental &amp; physical abuse he gives poor Robin when is escorting her to the Gates of Justice.

With the events of Oden's flashback coming to an end we learned joyboy prophesied a large scale war to break out and Oden figured it would happen around 25 years time based off of the voices him and Roger heard about the two kings being born in 10 years, and then 15 more for them to grow strong. Its worth noting that the voice seems to be unsure, his quote is ""Soon the two kings will be born... this time things will surely work out, even if it takes 10 years until they're born, even if they take another 15 to grow strong"". Even though Luffy doesn't quite fit that 10 years til they're born, but neither did shirahoshi, it seemed like it was more of an estimate, however the 25 years part definitely seemed to be true, as the events unfolding happen 25 years after Roger and Oden hear the voices.

However This really just solidified what some suspected which is that Luffy truly contains the inherited will of JoyBoy, as the two kings meeting refers to Poseidon (Shirahoshi) and the Pirate King (Luffy, or pirate king to be) meeting on Fishman island, and the event of these two coming together would lead to Luffy completing Joyboys promise to the fishmen, which was that him and poseidon would lift Noah and save it. 

 I'd also like to add, and this is where the first part of my theory comes into place that I don't think that the relation between Luffy and Joyboy ends at just the inherited will. I think that Joyboy created the D lineage and every D in the series is related in some way to Joyboy (similarly to how Nobles have some relation to the former monarchies, but the ones who have direct connections are the celestial dragons) but those related by blood are the strongest,  however the Monkey family is the closest living lineage to Joyboy. I believe this because every single direct relative we know of Luffy's is an absolute monster. The hero of the Marines, Monkey D Garp, and the leader of the revolutionaries and the worlds most wanted man, Monkey D Dragon. Seems way too convenient that every person in this dudes family has such a high threshold of strength and they all have the ability to become legendary fighters, almost like they have a very close lineage to one of the main forces in the void century. 

First I want to say: I don't think Shanks is some sort of all future seeing prophet but I do believe that he has a lot more knowledge about the events unfolding around the world than he gives off and I personally believe after Rogers death he took it upon himself to be a balancing act between the Pirates and the Gov't until the great war begins, he just wanted to wait until he knew the Pirates would win, and he knew his best chance was to wait for A true descendant of Joyboy HE could turn into the pirate that would change the world. 

I believe Shanks came to Foosha Island because he knew that the Monkey family was the closest living lineage left to joyboy, and Luffy fit the age of the king mentioned, he'd   And he spent a year in foosha village to help guide Luffy along the path that would best fit the world. It was important to do at that age he intervened because Garp would soon begin training luffy in combat (along with Ace and Sabo) because he had planned on them becoming Marines. 

Theres on big thing that happens on Foosha Village that I think Shanks did that really set the stage for Luffy, and that was deny him a voyage on his ship. Luffy had asked if he could come along, Shanks said no, his crew even asked and Shanks simply said ""If one of you give up your spot he can come"" and they all stopped trying to help him at that point. I find it really interesting because Shanks obviously liked Luffy and so did his crew and Pirate apprentices are pretty common it seems throughout the one piece world. However I think Shanks may have been worried if he took Luffy at that point it may set up the world in a bad angle,  because in order for Luffy to truly discover his destiny and become as strong as he could, he had to go his own path, and not the path that Shanks was taking. Shanks wasn't interested in being pirate king and knew it wouldn't be right to take Luffy there as a crew mate. He had to become pirate king with his own crew, just like Roger did. 

Now some of you guys might be thinking

""Frizzykid how do you even know Shanks knows about the great war, what if Roger didn't tell him!"" 

2 things.

The first: We must ask, why did Roger find Laugh tale? It seems like it wasn't meant to be found yet based off what they learned, however its at this point Roger begins to suspect that someone was going to shake up the world, someone more powerful than him.

But what if Roger was supposed to find Laugh Tale? What if he needed to find Laugh tale in order for someone to intervene with Luffy to make sure he followed the right path to avoid history repeating itself. Someone that joyboy didn't have. I think that someone is Shanks, and Roger left the knowledge to rayleigh, and after Rogers death I believe Rayleigh told Shanks, that is why Shanks started his pirate crew, to meet the man who would change the world. He knew he had time though, as he started his crew shortly after Roger died 24  years ago so Luffy wouldn't be alive for another 5 years, and Shanks wouldn't visit foosha village for another 12 (luffy was 7 when he met Shanks, 5+7 = 12)

My other clue, You guys may remember [this panel](https://imgur.com/a/hXQEyTU) from the manga. I believe it is here we know for sure that Shanks knows what is coming. Shanks knows that they will soon meet because it is time for Shanks to give Luffy the final tools he needs to complete his journey. I don't think he has the final poneglyph,  but I believe he is hiding it for Luffy because he had to make sure that whoever found what is on Laugh Tale was worthy of the power that it would give them. I believe the ultimate end of Wano will be Luffy being told where to go find the final road poneglyph as to avoid the Marines from completely taking over with whatever their new weapon is.",8,1584235274,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fitdce/spoilers_theory_regarding_why_shanks_visited/,OnePiece,1
fitb03,purtahan,How can Aokiji clean hit Blackbeard if they decide to fight?,"I really want Aokiji as a character. He's laidback persona and combat prowess really appeals to me.

fisd6y,WinLoseRatio,Sanji's Cake,"Heya,
So there's something that has been bothering me for awhile and it's Bege's line here:
https://imgur.com/a/zXKU2U2

Now remember, before this Bege didn't agree to just let the cake be. He wanted to put poison in it and it makes a heavy amount of sense to do that when given a one in a million chance of a guaranteed way to eleminate a Yonkou. Especially considering he was planning to assassinate her the past few years. 

Even with Sanji's moral, Bege would have done so anyways. But no, after tasting the cake (or I think just smelling the cake), he concluded that the poison isn't even necessary at that point. That it is something more stronger.

So that leads me to believe this cake will have a significant impact in the future fight, either directly or indirectly. 

Some of the things I suspect:

1) We never get to see the fate of Germa and Jinbei so she might let them live because of the cake.

2) The real reason Big Mom went to Wano is to take Sanji by force. 

3) Big Mom will betray Kaido just for the sake of Sanji. Or maybe Sanji can control Big Mom now without her realising it.

Well something along those lines.

We did get to see how she was after she ate the cake and the strawhats left though, still angry and being her scary self. But maybe it's an act? I just feel like there should be a way for Oda to use this.

The main point is, the cake will play a bigger role.",2,1584231098,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fisd6y/sanjis_cake/,OnePiece,1

firat5,QuaccDog,Zoro Kurozumi,"This is now very possible. Zurozumi are a family of actors. They start their missions at a very young age, and are incredibly committed to their roles.

Oda setup:
-Virgo. Vice admiral. Zoro Parallel. Was a traitor for a pirate crew. His marine subordinates couldn‚Äôt believe that he was traitor even as he hurt them. He played his role and quietly covered up the actions of Doflamingo.
-Rosinante. Was an executive in Doflamingo‚Äôs crew. A spy for the world government. 
-Katakuri. Second in command of Big Mom pirates. Zoro Parallel who acts contrary to how he really is like inside. His whole family thought they knew his personality, but they didn‚Äôt.
-Kanjiro. Kinimon‚Äôs sidekick. His comic relief (that he couldn‚Äôt draw) was a lie.

Zoro was excited when he was in thriller bark and heard the word samurai. Hiyori recognized Zoro‚Äôs battle cry. Zoro‚Äôs comic relief (that he gets ‚Äúlost‚Äù a lot) could be fake. Maybe informing someone. Remember when law was following Zoro in Zou when he was getting lost?

His possible missions:
- Learn the sword techniques of a sword master that left Wano.
- Recover Wano artifacts that were taken from Wano.
- General information gathering.

Sidenote: Zoro doesn‚Äôt have to be Kurozumi to be a traitor. I only think he is specifically Kurozumi because of Hiyori. It would also be exciting for the story since it would put a time limit on his cover.",12,1584226761,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/firat5/zoro_kurozumi/,OnePiece,1

I thought about the Edd War when I saw sunny shooting a cannon on Beast Pirates ship.

Oda usually doesn't show Roger and his crew fighting; I think it is because he doesn't not want to spoil the abilities and powers the Strawhats are yet to have.

But naval warfare in One Piece is supposed be more rich than running away from marines.

I also think that Oda is, hopefully, too realistic to miss an important aspect like this in Pirates' life.

fipw0v,Messimenia,Spoiler: The recent reveal of the traitor and why I am not so mad about him," So allot of people saw it coming, that Kanjuro is the traitor. But for some reason I don't feel as mad about him as I do about Orochi and Kaido out of a simple reason. Kanjuro was used more like a tool, his backstory and his reasonings are different from being simply pure evil.

Yes I know that Orochi also lost his parents and was persecuted but in contrast to Kanjuro he is torturing and killing the people out of pure evil and hatred. Kanjuro on the other hand appears like an empty shell. With simply no will to life or emotions. He even was ready to die with the Scabbards and in his own words never intended to do the other harms from his will but was merely playing a role like a robot with no soul. Seeing your parents getting murdered by a mob for no apparent reason is something horrible.

Orochi and Kaido on the other hand do show emotions, sadistic emotions getting pleasure from other people suffering. This is why I have rather disappointment towards Kanjuro rather than hatred as I do to the other two guys.

fip46e,BeeTheKing,Need your help for Power Scaling (mathematically),"Guys, I been working on my Power Ranking for a while.. But I still think something is missing..
And that is maths background.

I have a really good scoring system. My own secret method..  it consist raw strength, haki, abilities and everything else used in a fight.
And the best part of the method that its almost perfectly match with the bounties.

So my question is:

How can we mesaure difference between characters???
Mathematically!

Some examples:
(Subject A will always have 1.000.000 Power Level (PL). And that is Katakuri in my system.)

So
1. Subject A defeat 2 Subject B with same PL, in a high diff fight.

2. Subject A defeated by Subject B in a 
a. High diff (that matchup is Katakuri vs Luffy) 
b. Med diff
c. Low diff
fight. 

In your opinion how much is the Subject Bs PL??
Do you think there is a math way to measure the differences?

These are just some examples. You can bring your own examples if its needed. Just wanted to point on what I am thinking about.

I really appreciate any answers! Thanks",7,1584218355,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fip46e/need_your_help_for_power_scaling_mathematically/,OnePiece,1

fionxg,Tails6666,Denjiro vs the Traitor,"Hello, the traitor has finally been revealed in the last chapter and I can think of no perfect opponent for him other than Denjiro. 

It is my personal wish and I do also theorize that Denjiro is going to be the one that cuts down Kanjuro. The two traitors, one good, one bad. Denjiro hates Orochi more than just about anything but I feel is the type that will hate Kanjuro even more. I'd love to see a confrontation between these two and I think it is going to happen. 

If it doesn't happen, then I think the perfect opponent is going to be Kinemon. Though I just imagine it would be so perfect if Denjiro revealed himself and fought Kanjuro to save Momonosuke. He already has protected Hiyori for so long and for him to reveal himself in order to protect Oden's other child would likely give me goosebumps.

fimrp7,machhour,The Final Battle - The Ultimate Ending (theory),"I‚Äôve been thinking and I believe I have a foolproof theory about the final battle in One Piece.

So Oda likes to go full circle often in his story. He likes to keep things symmetrical. He draws parallels often and likes to tie things back to dynamics from the beginning of this epic tale.

My theory is this: 

Luffy‚Äôs final battle, the one that will decide the fate of the world, won‚Äôt be against Blackbeard or Imu, not even against Akainu.....

His last fight, the one for all of the marbles and for the title of Pirate MF King, will be against his true original arch-nemesis Buggy D. Clown.

Buggy has been there from day 1, even from the days of Roger. He even came out of a fight with Mihawk, the most powerful swordsman in the current world, UNSCATHED. Soon he will make his next jump from Warlord to Gorosei, and then to the new Imu. 

The final battle between him and Luffy will result in such a huge, powerful clash of Conqueror‚Äôs Haki that it will completely level Mariejois and reunite all four seas into one again, the All Blue. 

In my humble opinion, this is the only plausible end to the tale of One Piece.

fimd0b,soulpocus,One Piece whole ending theory,"In the Void Century there was a magical race, similar to that of the Jotnar from Norse Mythology. **Im** and **David** are part of this race. Im has the power of **darkness**. David had the power of **fire**. **David was the king of the huge and prosperous Great Kingdom** (Debiddo no Ookoku?). He was wearing a **straw hat**.

**King David from the Bible** was the king of Israel and he expanded it, made it prosperous and unified its kingdoms. David was usually wearing a red band. Jesus was a descendant of David and fire is the symbol of God. Absalom was David‚Äôs son, Saul was another king of Israel, both Israel and Marijoa are called Holy Land. The Great Kingdom is very similar to Israel. 

David, Poseidon and the Sea Kings tried to take the inhabitants of Fishman Island to the surface using Noah, but **Im divided the twenty kingdoms of the Great Kingdom**.

‚Äú**Pangaea**‚Äù in ‚Äú**Pangaea Castle**‚Äù: divided Great Kingdom. Oda didn‚Äôt want to talk about this term, where‚Äôs the Great Kingdom?, why hasn‚Äôt Oda told us the names of the Twenty Kingdoms, apart from Nefertari and Don Quijote?, Nefertari and Don Quijote people ruled on islands, the Twenty Kingdoms were described very vaguely.

**David fought Im but he lost and Im took his hat.** **Ace VS Blackbeard** was a foreshadowing of David VS Im. Ace lost to Blackbeard and he also lost his hat. Blackbeard said that the Yami Yami no Mi is unique and it grants the most evil abilities. Maybe this is because this power belongs to Im. Are Akuma no Mi the powers of this race? Toki came from a distant past and had eaten the Toki Toki no Mi.

Before his death, David created the Red Line with his power of fire. ‚Äú**In the last moment of his life, he turned his fading ‚Äúflame of life‚Äù into a huge fire that enveloped the world**‚Äù. These are Rayleigh‚Äôs words about Roger‚Äôs death. Plus, a certain **cross** often returns in One Piece. God created the world. The Jotunn Ymir was killed and his body created the world.

At the end of Stampede there are the **streaks of fire left by Sabo and the place where the festival was held** √† reference to the Red Line and the Reverse Mountain area.

If the Great Kingdom is the Pangaea, **the All Blue is the Panthalassa**, that was the only ocean of the world. People talk about the All Blue because they know about it from the books, but the Red Line, the Grand Line and the New World made it physically disappear. Were the Grand Line and the New World created by David‚Äôs death (the death of Jesus unleashed a storm)?

The island on which David died is Laugh Tale. This island is very similar to the Great Kingdom. Raft + El (God). Raftel = Let far. The words Rayleigh said after those we saw are: ‚Äú**I‚Äôve never laughed more than on that day**!!‚Äù

**Laugh Tale was enveloped in flames and now is within the Red Line**. This island is indeed the last island of the New World, but it‚Äôs not on the visible sea. Roger and the others were the only ones to completely explore the New World √† this fact tells us that there‚Äôs a place in the New World that nobody, apart from them, has ever explored.

**The red band of the straw hat and the red colour of the Road Poneglyphs are a foreshadowing of the Red Line**. **The material used to create the Poneglyphs was taken from the Red Line**, because both these things are considered indestructible.

**The 400 Silent Years** (similar to the Void Century) were a period between the Old and the New Testament in which God didn‚Äôt speak to the jewish people. In this period there were:

1. Changes in the government of Israel (like in the Great Kingdom).

2. Many apocryphal books (the Poneglyphs).

3. The necessary preparations for the coming of Jesus Christ as the Messiah (Roger).

**Noah was faithful and obedient to God for more than 900 years**. The events of the Void Century date back to 900 years before the beginning of the series.

**Im forced the Twenty Kingdoms to form the World Government and then they made sure that the Twenty Kingdoms were the ones who did everything**. The Empty Throne and the swords aren‚Äôt a symbol of equality and peace. Clover hypotesized that the enemy of the Great Kingdom could have survived throughout the centuries and the Five Elders seemed worried.

**Im erased everything (also God Valley) with their power of darkness.** Is the race of Im the extinct race? Is Im responsible for the extinction? Do Buster Calls replace Im‚Äôs power of darkness? Many real life governments censored things. Oden said that the Kozuki Clan closed the borders of Wa because of a certain strong power √† Im‚Äôs power of darkness.

**In the Room of Flowers there were pictures, clues about Im:** 1. Luffy: he reminds Im of David. 2. Blackbeard: he has Im‚Äôs power of darkness. 3. Shirahoshi: Im knows she‚Äôs Poseidon. 4. Vivi: her ancestors refused to go and live in Marijoa (were they trying to rebel or protect something in their homeland?) and her family is causing problems. Im has decided to make Vivi and her people pay.

**The Kozuki invented the Poneglyphs because they wanted people to:**

1. **Destroy the World Government** that was just born with the help of the Ancient Weapons.

2. **Find David**, thanks to the Road Poneglyphs. Laugh Tale isn‚Äôt present on any map because it has always been hidden. The Road Poneglyphs are the only way to reach Laugh Tale.

3. **Never forget the history of the Great Kingdom and that of every nation that was part of it.**

4. **Read David‚Äôs apologies to the inhabitants of Fishman Island.** David was known as Joy Boy.

**The Will of D. is the will of the people from the Great Kingdom and the current D. bearers are the descendants of these people**. Those from the Great Kingdom used the D. in David as a code, to never forget him and who they were. They handed down the D., as hinted by Saul and Law, but Im noticed this and erased their memories of David with their power of darkness. **They handed down the D. without knowing its meaning.** Oda said that the D. is extremely important:

1. The World Government hid the D. in ‚ÄúGol D. Roger‚Äù.

2. If the D. bearers don‚Äôt remember the meaning of the D., they aren‚Äôt a threat (think about some marines).

3. Corazo‚Äôn said that the D. bearers are the sworn enemies of the gods.

4. Kureha said that the D. bearers are dangerous and revolutionary people. 

5. Jaguar D. Saul was the only known member of the D. Clan to be a giant. Giants come from Elbaf, but if the D. Clan comes from the Great Kingdom, then **Elbaf was part of the Great Kingdom.**

6. The **Will of David** is similar to the **Will of God.**

7. Whitebeard said that **killing someone with a D. in their name would not extinguish the flames of their will.** Are D. and fire connected? He also talked about the One Piece right after having thought about the Will of D., giving the impression that maybe the two things are connected. When Whitebeard was discussing the Will of D., he also mentioned the One Piece. Are D. and the One Piece connected by more than just Roger?

8. Usopp and Robin asked Rayleigh about the One Piece, the Void Century and the Will of D., all within one conversation.

9. After having found the One Piece, Rayleigh said he now understands why the World Government wants to hide the D. in Roger‚Äôs name.

**David reincarnated first in Gol D. Roger and then in Luffy.** **It is said that king David (Joy Boy) still lived in the Messiah (Roger and Luffy). Roger had affinity with fire:**

1. Rayleigh‚Äôs words about his death.

2. In an anime episode he seemed to control the fire of a lantern.

3. Ace had the power of fire.

Roger said that **he would have liked to be born in the same period as Joy Boy‚Äôs.**

**Luffy has affinity with fire too:** Red Hawk technique.

Roger had a straw hat and Luffy has Roger‚Äôs straw hat. In a chapter there are children wearing straw hats √† the straw hats are being sold and Roger bought one because he felt that something was missing.

**Both Roger and Luffy were helped by David (God):**

1. Roger won against Shiki because a **storm** sunk half of Shiki‚Äôs fleet. Plus, Jesus‚Äô death unleashed a storm, like after the death of Roger (Jesus).

2. Luffy was saved by a **lightning** just before his execution. Nyon said that **Luffy seems to be protected by somebody up in the sky.** Luffy told Nami that he‚Äôll find the One Piece because **he‚Äôs lucky.** 

**The David from the Bible was saved by God in every one of his feats.**

Roger smiled before his death and Luffy smiled before his execution. Roger said to Rayleigh that he wouldn‚Äôt die, even if his death was inevitable. He would have lived again, somehow. His fatal illness was an expedient that Oda used to let Luffy begin his journey. **Roger turned himself in to the Navy to spread his message to Joy Boy.** 

Roger and Luffy know they have a mission:

1. Roger said to Rayleigh: **‚ÄúThis is a fateful meeting, Rayleigh. How about overturning the world together with me?‚Äù.**

2. Luffy wants to find the One Piece and become Pirate King.

David, Roger and Luffy look alike (God is similar to His creations). Luffy told Buggy that he wants to become Pirate King and Buggy said: **‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre the Pirate King, then I‚Äôm God‚Äù**. Crocus said that Luffy had a **strange aura** and that they could be the people they were waiting for.

Luffy says the same things that Roger said. Roger and Luffy have the Voice of All Things.

Shanks said to Rayleigh that he saw a kid in East Blue that said the exact same things Roger said, so he was surprised.

**Gol Roger = objective received.** **Joy Boy = joyful boy** (Luffy)/the David from the Bible was only 30 when he began reigning on Israel and he was joyful/king Joyoboyo. Joy Boy is written in quotes √† it‚Äôs a pseudonym.

Roger was waiting for Luffy (Joy Boy), so Blackbeard isn‚Äôt the person for sure.

Laugh Tale (1): before his death, Roger wanted to warn Joy Boy to go and find the One Piece, but he also wanted to make fun of those who thought there was a treasure trove on Laugh Tale.

Luffy will need words that remind of **‚ÄúOpen, sesame!‚Äù.** Oda was inspired by One Thousand and One Nights and ‚ÄúOpen, sesame!‚Äù is the most characteristic thing about this work. Within a mountain (Red Line) there‚Äôs a treasure (the One Piece). 

Nyon said these words about Luffy:

**‚ÄúWhat incredible fortune! Monkey D. Luffy, have you actually managed to SHIFT THIS MOUNTAIN (Hancock) that no other could budge?‚Äù**

Roger‚Äôs words: **‚ÄúI have come here and will lead this passage to the farthest ends of the world.‚Äù:** these are the words to say at the end of the New World, in front of the Red Line.

**Roger opened the passage (thanks to the Voice of All Things?) because he was Joy Boy. Luffy will do the same because he‚Äôs Joy Boy.**

Laugh Tale (2):

1. There‚Äôs nothing at the end of the New World, but Laugh Tale is there and nobody notices it.

2. If somebody knows the words to open and close the passage and forgot them, they would be stuck in the cave forever (this part is a bit cruel).

**The One Piece is the BURNING BUSH (Joy Boy‚Äôs soul):**

1. **Bright as a treasure, a miracle** (Roger said it was ACTUALLY a MIRACLE EVERYTHING he did with his crew. He had known something miraculous, other than the adventures with his crew), **God and fire, has a voice, is within a cave.**

2. **Mount Sinai** is similar to Laugh Tale and they both seem difficult to climb. When God went to Mount Sinai, He caused **smoke, tremors and bad weather.** **Sinai Peninsula** and the Red Line portion in which Laugh Tale is hidden are similar. 

3. God said to Moses to go and free the jewish people √† David will tell Luffy and the others to go and free his people (**‚ÄúLet my people go!‚Äù**).

4. Almost all Ace‚Äôs attacks are a reference to God. The attack ‚ÄúShinka Shiranui‚Äù: **Shinka = God‚Äôs fire ‚Äì Shiranui = mysterious/unknown light on the sea** (the Shiranui is a real life phenomenon).

5. Im and the Five Elders like to **extinguish lights from history**. Maybe there‚Äôs one light they missed (Blackbeard, are you sure darkness wins over fire?).

6. Zoro doesn‚Äôt believe in **God**. He might change his mind in the future.

7. Joy Boy didn‚Äôt have the time to leave anything, he was dying. Joy Boy told Roger and the others a funny or joyful story (Joy Boy‚Äôs funny and joyful and makes people laugh). Joy Boy then told them that they were too soon because he discovered that Poseidon (Shirahoshi) wasn‚Äôt yet born, so they can‚Äôt implement the final plan yet. 

8. Oden said: ‚Äú**I‚Äôll keep the fire alive**‚Äù (but the translations are different).

9. Usopp asked Rayleigh if Roger had voluntarily started the Great Age of Pirates and Rayleigh said, with a smile, that **this should be asked to Roger himself, who is dead**. He then added that **only the people who are alive right now can decide the fate of the current time**.

10. The kanji of ‚ÄúOne Piece‚Äù mean ‚Äú**the great treasure that unites humanity**‚Äù: God/Joy Boy (he tried to unite people).

11. Kaido: ‚Äú**They will be talking about you and your incredible death for years to come**‚Äù. Oden: ‚Äú**They can forget me for all I care, my soul will live on!**‚Äù: this is exactly what happened to Joy Boy. No one spoke about his incredible death, everyone forgot him and the meaning of the D‚Ä¶. But this doesn‚Äôt matter to him, because his soul (the One Piece) will always be there. God never abandoned His people.

12. Whitebeard: ‚Äú**The One Piece exists**!!!‚Äù: ‚ÄúJoy Boy exists (God exists)!!!‚Äù.

13. When Roger was looking at the **fire of the lantern**, he remembered the One Piece.

14. Gol D. Roger‚Äôs message in Stampede: ‚Äú**In a deep, lofty darkness, you will find your answer**‚Äù: in the darkness (Im/within the Red Line) there‚Äôs the answer (Joy Boy/God).

15. One Piece: Won Peace: God brings peace to the world.

17. **Joy Boy‚Äôs ‚Äúflame of life‚Äù was FADING, but it never WENT OUT.**

**With Joy Boy‚Äôs help, the Rio Poneglyph will be revealed.**

Other references to fire:

1. People in Wa were talking about the return of the Kozuki Clan: **‚ÄúIs this the work of the ghosts?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of asking? This spark will start a fire!‚Äù.** 

2. Description of the Nine Red Scabbards: **‚ÄúThe 9 men he had gathered, now samurai, walked in unison, illuminated by the light of a scarlet sun, made those vaillant men glisten red like flames, as did the swords on their waists, refelected the blaze of their lives, the Wano country would later respectfully call these loyal men the Nine Red Scabbards.‚Äù**

**Pluton will destroy the entire Red Line and Marijoa.** **Laugh Tale and Joy Boy‚Äôs soul will be destroyed too, but they will have already served their purpose by then. Many of the Mugiwara‚Äôs dreams will be more achievable. Celestial Dragons will have to go and live with humans, who‚Äôll make them pay. Fishman Island will be destroyed too, but with the help of the Sea Kings and Noah, Poseidon (Shirahoshi) will finally bring the inhabitants of Fishman Island to the surface. Joy Boy (Luffy) will keep his promise.** 

**The World Government‚Äôs defeat will be watched live by the whole world, that will have known the truth. Will Uranus be involved in Im‚Äôs defeat?** 

**Luffy will become Pirate King because he‚Äôs the freest person and has helped others and brought peace, like God.** 

‚ÄúOne Piece‚Äù: 

1. Joy Boy‚Äôs soul.

2. Laugh Tale (ONE PIECE of the Great Kingdom).

3. The All Blue.

4. The moral union of people and countries.

5. Roger and Luffy (ONE PIECE of Joy Boy).

I‚Äôd like to conclude with other Rayleigh‚Äôs words about Roger: **‚ÄúHe was our captain, and he was a magnificent man!!!‚Äù.**

Before, we saw Yasue's speech about unbeheaded Kaido IN Zoro's panel. 

Then, parallel between Oden and Zoro. 

Both wielding Enma, met 26 years old Toki and Hiyori, fainted and treated, enraged by Orochi, two sword style'd Orochi, scaring Orochi, someone help Orochi (barier/denijiro) 

Little by little he became Oden 2.0 the only thing left is wounding kaido? 

Now that we see this panel. Oda definitely planned something big for this Maigo Kenshin.",4,1584200368,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fik8as/spoiler_i_noticed_something_from_the_latest/,OnePiece,1

fik33f,carlosaugus1o,Kanjuro: a bad hair day (spoilers),"So, finally, Kanjuro was revealed to be the traitor. Not only that, he is also a Kurozumi. And now that he has become one of the enemies, it's quite possible that someone will have to fight him in the future. And these are the roots for this theory.

At first, not much is revealed about Kanjuro. In chapter 962 we're told that he was a weirdo that used to steal hair, both from the alive and the dead, ir order to make brushes. Now, that's a weird habit to say the least.

[A hairy situation](https://preview.redd.it/s9dgdadjknm41.png?width=725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54fe61fddd3685f0363a1eca8424a6b5fb2ca939)

Now, here comes an interesting detail. After Lord Yasue's tragic death (may him rest in peace), in chapter 951, Kanjuro is chosen as the one responsible for taking care of his corpse. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 3uep5gp0nnm41...*

One interesting thing about Yasue was his epiphet. ""Yasue the Hedgehog"". That was due to his very distinct spiky and blue hair (can't think of any Sonic jokes, sorry).

&amp;#x200B;

[Your sacrifice will not be in vain!](https://preview.redd.it/46xv11g9onm41.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af10679f0c90f88fbe98e61ca28f70504f060a1a)

Now, i think you can see where I'm going with this. Kanjuro's favorite material for his brushes is human hair. And Yasue's hair would make for a quite distinct brush. Maybe a brush capable of making quite phenomenal pieces of art as well. How cruel would't it be if the scabbard fated to defeat this demon discovered that Shimotsuki Yasuie's hair was being used as a weapon by a traitor. That not even is his death, he could rest in peace?

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hope the theory was objective end easy to read. See ya!",133,1584199792,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fik33f/kanjuro_a_bad_hair_day_spoilers/,OnePiece,1

fijt1x,AladdinMathafacka,Spoiler. About the Spy,Am i the only one that feels like Oda fucked it up. I mean. What? I don't really care who it was. But the timing was 100% terrible in my opinion. I mean if the plan was to ruin their plan and get Momonosuke. There could be atleast 100 ways of doing it just by keeping his identity hidden. Why reveal it? It feels so stupid. Orochi is a paranoid person. Therefore he always tries everything to be safe. I mean he did it for over 20 years. His patience have been really high even tho it doesn't seem like it sometimes. But come on revealing it now and doing that entrence with Luffy was just unclimatic... well in my opinion i think it would have been better to keep the spy hidden. But well if that was the case then Luffy would not have any chance winning. But if Luffy is going to win at least make him deserve it. Don't just throw everything on a silver platter. Its always been the case in every anime but im kind of tired of seeing this over and over again... if Luffy is gonna be King of whatever.

He is worse than Kurohige and Akainu so he deserved to die for what he did. If Roger and WB would have know what he did, they would have killed him without compassion. If you doubt that, ask this to Buggy or Squard

fig3ge,Ra_19,"Possible connections between Zunesha, Momonosuke, Kozuki family, Wano and upcoming Wano War.","Minks have always been close to the Kozuki family. And for some reason, Momonosuke was able to converse with the big elephant(Zunesha) and order him to destroy Jack. A little flashback on Zunesha. In the ancient past, Zunesha was sentenced to walk the seas for eternity and only act upon being ordered to do so for committing an unspecified crime.

How are the Minks and Kozuki related if Zou is a moving island on top of Zunesha? Why is Wano a closed country all these years and why did Zunesha ask Momonosuke's permission?

I think the Zunesha's crime and Wano being a closed country are related. It could be that Zunesha did something wrong and the one who punished her was a Kozuki leader. Or it could be that Kozuki leader died while protecting Zunesha and it casted a punishment on itself in self guilt. So it has to serve the sentence and the only way it can act is by taking permission from the Kozuki family.

The peculiar geography of Wano has also to be taken into consideration. If the height of Zunesha and Wano could be comparable, it may be possible that Zunesha used to stay near or beside Wano and aided them. After it went away, due to crime it committed and Wano became closed country.

During the Wano war, Zunesha may return along with the minks to fight and redeem itself for the crimes it committed and help to open Wano's borders once again.

So I'm guessing Sanji and Zoro will also get teamed up when they fight King and Queen. Because.. well. They aren't strong enough to take them themself. No evidence of it whatsoever. Luffy's gonna bet tagged so it's likely that his future ""Commanders"" will too. We just gotta wait and see who they team-up with. My guess is Sanji will be with Drake and Zoro with Hawkins after their ""scuffle"" was probably a hint to that.

fif389,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 21: Orange Town Conclusion,"Yes, this is my first time reading One Piece

The chapter starts with the aftermath of the Buggy fight. Luffy is still asking Nami to join his crew, Nami is still refusing. I‚Äôm predicting that the next arc will have something to do with her, and end with her joining the crew. All we have is that she needs to buy a village, and someone close to her was killed by pirates. Not much to go off of, but I‚Äôm still going to keep my guess of her needing to buy back her village from pirates, who took it from her. Luffys hat being busted really sucks, but it seems like he‚Äôs still able to wear it, which is why he isn‚Äôt bawling his eyes out. Also he beat the shit out of Buggy, which was probably cathartic. The Buggy pirates are down for the count, which makes sense seeing as they just saw their captain get launched. Zoro being able to sit up after all the shit he went through was crazy, but I guess Nami is right in saying they‚Äôre inhuman. The villagers arrive and we get a scene similar to the one from Romance Dawn. I feel like Luffy is either incredibly stupid or incredibly smart for what he does, I think it just stems from the fact that he‚Äôs oblivious to everything and told the truth without realizing how bad it made him sound. On the other hand, you can tell from Luffy's dialogue while running away that he thinks the villagers are really good people to be getting so mad, showing that he could have just been messing around to see how they would react (although I'm definitely leaning towards the former) . I don‚Äôt know which it is, but I do know Zoro laughing his ass off was pretty funny. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is kind of a culmination of all those smaller subplots in a satisfying way too. Chouchou comes in to help Luffy out, it didn‚Äôt need to happen but it was a nice way to finish out that whole mini arc. We see three goons at the harbor who apparently didn‚Äôt get the memo that Buggy got fucked. The whole interaction with Zoro was funny, and a great way of showing that even after a fight like his one with Cabaji, he‚Äôs still intimidating as fuck. We get to see Boodle wake up, who realizes what happened and races after Luffy to thank him. Boodles little character moment here is nice, the running theme of picking your battles is something that I think will continue throughout the series, as it was a big part here and in Romance Dawn, even if it wasn‚Äôt really the central theme. Luffy leaving treasure behind for village repairs was another really subtle but great character moment for him. With that, the Orange Town arc is completed, it seems that Luffy is moving into the forest of judgement next. If I had to guess, it might have something to do with past events and whether they should be held against you? Or it‚Äôs just a cool name to give to a random island. 

&amp;nbsp; 

So, how did I feel about Orange Town? I liked it a lot actually! I feel like it‚Äôs a step up from Romance Dawn. That arc established characters and themes, while this arc feels like it‚Äôs actually starting to explore them. Buggy is a great comedic villain, and I find his past with Shanks to be interesting. The central theme of treasure is integrated really well, and I like all the little side village characters that make the town feel more alive. So yeah, I thought this arc was pretty good. I‚Äôll start putting them in rankings at the end of each one, just for fun. Right now it‚Äôs looking like
1. Orange Town
2. Romance Dawn
But yeah, I‚Äôm really enjoying One Piece so far, I can‚Äôt see why everyone adores it, but I do know why it‚Äôs generally well liked and popular. But from what I‚Äôve heard, these are palate cleansers for what‚Äôs coming up next, which excites me a ton.",6,1584173036,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fif389/one_piece_journey_chapter_21_orange_town/,OnePiece,1

fieqap,downtimeredditor,Law's ultimate special devil fruit ability and the conflict of when he'll use it,"Quick Side Note: I watch the anime. I don't read the manga.  

So main topic: laws special ability the surgery to give eternal youth at the cost of the death of user who performs this procedure aka law. I'm not sure if Law knows how to do this procedure. Based on the fact that Law is a doctor and also Doflamingo consistently demanding he do that procedure on Doflamingo I think Law knows it. Maybe Law has a desire to be Pirate King, but I don't feel like Law has expressed it in such a way that it is his goal like Luffy has and Kid has. Luffy is obviously really open about that desire. As is Kid who said hes killed people who laugh at his dream.  So I don't think Law has any real desire to be Pirate King but then again who knows maybe at the end wano or something he reiterates that's his desire who knows. Law also seems to have some knowledge of Will Of D. Since he teases Doflamingo about it and in reference to Luffy. This obviously just guess. I think the general consensus is that the illness he suffered from as a kid he treated himself but doing surgery at the molecular level so I feel like we can probably write off that he didn't do the surgery just yet. Is it possible the surgery is a multi-step procedure and that he did part of it to Luffy after the Summit War when law fixed Luffys wounds without anesthesia?  Will he eventually do it to Luffy?

Which comes with a conflict. 

 Luffy after the Summit War and Aces death beat himself up that he wasn't strong enough to save Ace hence the two years of training. Luffy wants to get strong enough so that he can save his close ones from death. Oda has stated in the past he doesn't really care to kill characters and the only reason he killed Ace was to make Luffy train to become stronger. Besides flashbacks we have obviously seen deaths in present time like Pedro sacrificing his life for the Strawhats and pound sacrificing himself for chiffon. But I kinda wonder if Luffy will be sad if Law used it on him and feel a bit of defeat that he wasn't strong enough to save Law. Let's be honest with how quickly Luffy attaches himself to people he probably cares a great deal for Law. So Law did it to Luffy and sacrificed himself for Luffy like would it hurt Luffys badly that he wasn't strong enough to keep law alive. 

Like we probably get the vibe that Luffy doesn't care to live a long life. Like I think if Luffy became pirate king and died the next day he'd probably be okay with it since he achieved his goal. 

Obviously with the Poneglyhs, Im, and the Frozen big Strawhat in Maryjoeis there are other things at play as well. Plus Whitebeards statement to Blackbeard that he ain't it chief.

But yeah as much as we think Law will use it on Luffy will there be that conflict of Luffy not being able save Law come at play. Idk

Also do you guys that eternal youth procedure is a multi-step procedure and law did the first step when performing surgery on Luffy without anesthesia after the Summit War?

Quick end question: how do I read the manga on the site this subreddit uses? 

Tbh I don't really know how to read the manga. Like I know that this subreddit use a site so I was wondering how I would I read it there. I am an American so typically I read the comics from left to right and top to down and I turn the comics pages from right to left. I know it is different in manga where it is read right to left but I'm not if it is read bottom of the page to top or if it is top of the page to bottom and I know in they open the books from left to right. So I guess how do I read the manga on the site they use in this subreddit.",2,1584170590,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fieqap/laws_ultimate_special_devil_fruit_ability_and_the/,OnePiece,1
fiep7y,optechhas,The next chapter and the war! [SPOILERS],"2 predictions for the next chapter:

1- The war is happening at the sea:

""When you're at the sea, you fight pirates"" is not an arbitrary line by Luffy. Kanjuro will use his powers to inform Orochi of what happened. Orochi will stay scared back at Onigashima, while Big Mom and Kaido will come and meet the ""pirates"" halfway, like it happened with Oden, but this time, at the sea. The scabbards will reach Onigashima and get their revenge against Orochi and his army.


2. We'll know the what is the egg of Oro Jackson: 

Someone pointed out a similar-looking egg on one of the ships heading to Onigashima in the current chapter (Kidd's ship probably).

I think Oda will raise the stakes even more since we still didn't see the curtains for Act 3, the supposed climax of the story. Many people already predicted that Uranus will be revealed in Wano, revealing an ancient weapon here would raise the hype 10 times!

fie75t,destinymaker,Is the traitor a bad traitor or a good traitor?,"I'm not talking about Kanjurou being redeemable or whatever, I'm talking about him being a good traitor for doing his job great for the past 20 years. For me he is not such a good traitor. Let's look it in the perspective of those who are in their universe not as a reader(ignoring hints like the drawn birds when they were sent to the future, anime opening, etc.). 

Dressrosa, yes he was captured and sent to jail but was not transformed. Maybe because when he was sent there, he doesn't know Doffy is under Kaido's protection. Remember, they jumped into the future. So when he was in the jail, he hid himself into the wall like when Kin'emon saw him, eating and drinking his BEST DRAWN food supplies. Doffy might not known about the teleported to the future thingy so he doesn't bother to tell Kaido any of it and just thought the samurai are escaping on Kaido's reach. Jack went to Zou but no one went to Dressrosa to capture them, especially Kaido thinks how weak Doffy is. So Kanjurou calling for back up is a good chance for them to get captured. They've been resting after the fight. But nope. Kanjurou didn't care cause he thought he'll just get Raizo at Zou. So bad, not even a good traitor. If you want to send information, make sure to send every bit of information you can. He unknowingly destroyed Doffy's plan via Usopp's ammunition. 

Zou, we now know how Jack got to Zou. But Jack didn't care about Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, cause maybe Kanjurou didn't thought those two scabbards made it outside the country. Kanjurou was there while Inuarashi explains everything about the road poneglyph, etc. Kanjurou have the full information about Robin's ability to read them and that people will try to get her. Kin'emon also said at chapter 818(?) not sure but it's the chapter after the Raizo is safe, that Kaido is attempting to get info out of them. So Kanjurou, do your job and report to your master Orochi that someone can still read the stones! But nope.. Cause we go to Wano... 

At Wano... Kanjurou didn't even tell Orochi about Robin. Cause if he did, Orochi would know that one of his geisha is Robin cause Kin'emon all planned what role they will do and what objectives they will get. He's an actor, yes, but he also said that all he does is feed Orochi infos.. All he did was telling about the plans and specific info(20 yrs tp, Raizo, Oden attacking Kaido, Law's subordinates[?]) not the most important things like Robin. He even told about Thousand Sunny's location. He didn't tell Orochi about Raizo being in Udon's prison so that they can capture him there.

I'm guessing he didn't even told his master about the poneglyph inside the whale at Zou. 

tldr: Kanjurou is a good actor, but not a good traitor and/or spy.",11,1584167203,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fie75t/is_the_traitor_a_bad_traitor_or_a_good_traitor/,OnePiece,1

fidpdi,lawofsandrick,Final Road Poneglyph (Shanks Possession[Formerly Roger's]),"Since everyone is confused about where is one of the road poneglyph is located I went back to some of the earliest chapters. And I was like why a pirate group like that of Shanks is in the weakest sea? Then it comes to my mind that maybe Shanks owns one of the poneglyph which is the one Roger had and then he left it the least suspicious place like how in the hell will you leave something important to a place like that? I think that will be the start of the Strawhats to fully travel the world, them moving back to the 4 blues and repeat to find the last piece to reach Laugh Tale. Anyway, it's just a thought so comment down if you have any ideas on your mind.

Take note that most of the yonkos have one of the road poneglyph like kaido and big mom that's why I think shanks have one too as a former member of the legendary pirate crew that would be some awesome feats for shanks since he was overhyped since the beginning, this might be one of the many reasons for us to fully know who he is.

ficsa7,d00dleb0y,The theme of the Wano Arc is about secret identities. The truth about Zoro and the ‚ÄúOne Piece‚Äù will be revealed in this arc.,"So far, there have been many aliases/disguises/spies/secret identities that have been revealed throughout this arc. 

Shutenmaru is actually Ashura Doji. 
Gyukimaru is actually Onimaru. 
Kamazo is actually Killer. 
Komurasaki is really Kozuki Hiyori.
Kyoshiro/Ushimitsu Kozo is actually Denjiro.
Kanjuro is actually a Kurozumi Clan member.
X Drake has actually been an undercover Marine this whole time. 
Bepo was actually working with Kaido‚Äôs crew prior to his alliance with Kid and Hawkins.
Raftel is actually ‚ÄúLaugh Tale‚Äù. 

Not to mention all of the other reveals in the Levely Arc.

I believe we are still not done with the reveals. Considering how Zoro is playing a main role in the storyline, and also how much of the storyline in this arc has introduced crucial backstory into the past of One Piece, I think the arc will eventually culminate with the reveal of what the One Piece actually is. 

I also believe we will find out that Toki is still alive. She might have used her powers on herself when people thought she had ‚Äúdied‚Äù.

The Marines are focused on taking out the Shichibukai and watching the newly formed alliance between Kiado and Big Mom, Blackbeard has the biggest opening he will ever get to weaken one of his biggest obstacles to being Pirate King and greatly increasing his strength in one move. 

I know I'm Reaching but if it is excited right Luffy will have a near impossible obstacles to overcome (even if Law perform the Immortal Surgery on him), making it that much more satisfying when he wins. It also gives the Marines, the new Fleet Admiral, and World Government reason to focus every ounce of their strength to crush him (solely to prove the are still a great force).

Moles: general irritability and increase in speaking because moles have the fastest mouth of any vertebrate.

Cats: insane bloodlust, but a cowardice towards anything percieved as marginally dangerous.

Dogs: enjoy heirarchy, might want to establish their own, good at detecting bad people, insanely loyal. Wolf only has the heirarchy part.

Spiders: Male: loyal to the point of suicide, but incredibly horny. Female: motherly to the point of suicide, but also really into bondage

Snakes: curious and patient

Ungulates: curious and nationalistic

Rodents: increase in intelligence and sometimes empathy

Non sawfly Hymenoptera: generally stealing a kid from their parents and replacing them with your own, as well as breaking into houses. If social, very nationalistic and willing to die for their family.

Lepidoptera: gluttony, compulsion to knit/build

Other insects: too many to list

Dinosaurs, including birds: intelligence, bloodlust

fibmir,ahood34,What did Whitebeard know about Blackbeard that we don‚Äôt?,"We know a theme of One Piece is characters playing their part in destiny and then passing their will to the next generation. We saw this most notably with Roger and Oden, and though we can‚Äôt understand some of their actions yet, that is just because they are privy to knowledge we as the readers are not (the Void Century, One Piece). That being said, everybody has a part to play in this grand scheme.

Blackbeard is a very peculiar character, he has lots of suspicious mannerisms and a mostly unexplored background. He is a D, but people have mentioned some inconsistencies between what we know of D and his actions. However I think Blackbeard begging Pops for his life was more strategic than cowardly. 

Any way, Whitebeard mentions Teech by name to Roger in their final conversation, and that provoked Roger to reveal many secrets. I wonder if Roger said anything that would make Whitebeard think that Teech has a part to play in destiny. That he is essential in some way for the final war. 

After that conversation, Teech stays in WB‚Äôs crew for like twenty years, gaining strength but remaining out of a leadership role. Sticking to behind the scenes. WB had to have been privy to him scarring Shanks and his past, I can‚Äôt imagine WB just is ignorant about one of his own sons. 

Nonetheless, he kills Thatch and WB gives him a special exemption. He tells Ace to let it be and accepts that Thatch will go unavenged. Why do that? It must have broke WB‚Äôs heart to come to peace with that. But if he believed Blackbeard had a pivotal part to play in the future maybe that‚Äôd explain his special exemption decision. Also, WB clearly knows something about Blackbeard‚Äôs past that makes him especially dangerous. I doubt he just learned whatever that is after he killed Thatch, he had to have known that for a long time, so why never address it? 

Any way, I think Ace‚Äôs death put WB over the edge, where he couldn‚Äôt accept the ‚Äúspecial exemption‚Äù mindset anymore. He was too heartbroken in the present to be concerned about the future. And that‚Äôs why he apologizes to his sons, because he fostered Blackbeard and let him loose on the world. 

In his final speech WB takes solace in saying that, even though this future is coming, Blackbeard will not be the Roger‚Äôs ‚Äúchosen one.‚Äù He may have a part in destiny but he is not destiny fulfilled. Blackbeard will play his part and set the stage for other players. 

 But for whatever reason, I feel like throughout his life, WB felt like Teech needed to be alive for the sake of the future. And he held that resolution up until he couldn‚Äôt bear it any longer. And when he went lethal he was too late, and he is sorry.",6,1584153368,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fibmir/what_did_whitebeard_know_about_blackbeard_that_we/,OnePiece,1

But for some reason I don't feel as mad about him as I do about Orochi and Kaido out of a simple reason. Kanjuro was used more like a tool, his backstory and his reasonings are different from being simply pure evil.

Yes I know that Orochi also lost his parents and was persecuted but in contrast to Kanjuro he is torturing and killing the people out of pure evil and hatred. Kanjuro on the other hand appears like an empty shell. With simply no will to life or emotions. He even was ready to die with the Scabbards and in his own words never intended to do the other harms from his will but was merely playing a role like a robot with no soul. Seeing your parents getting murdered by a mob for no apparent reason is something horrible.

fi99gs,Akainu14,Why Charlotte Smoothie Is highly Underrated,"For some reason it‚Äôs become a meme in the OP community that Smoothie is the weakest of the Yonkou commanders or that she isn‚Äôt deserving of her rank, which makes no sense so here is why I think she is highly underrated in terms of power. 


Smoothie‚Äôs devil fruit‚Äî the Shibu Shibu no mi‚Äî is quite versatile, it allows her to be effective close range and long range. She can buff her own range by absorbing water, using that water she can create massive water slashes like she did in chapter [894](https://i.imgur.com/7NqWICY.jpg)not even a named attack yet those slashes were as big as the Sunny and had the crew fearing for their lives. NOTE:  Only one slash was shown on panel but the strawhats‚Äô dialogue in that scene implies that multiple slashes were fired at them off panel similar to what was shown in the anime. What‚Äôs also worth noting is that the Sunny was at least 1 km ahead of her(from the Coup de burst) so you can‚Äôt really blame her for missing the ship either

In close combat she can juice enemies to the point that they become dried out husks or alternatively she can cut enemies with her sword to dehydrate them and absorb their water. With this also comes with the ability to remove poison, as we have seen throughout the series poison is no joke, so the ability to easily wring it out is an invaluable utility 

Lastly, gigantification power ups usually aren‚Äôt that impressive in the world of One Piece (Moriah‚Äôs Shadows Asgard, Enel‚Äôs Amaru, the average Giant, etc.) but the fact that we have a commander level character that‚Äôs basically a sponge with no known limit is downright terrifying.


Even if you don‚Äôt agree you have to at least respect her position in the New World, to put things into perspective, she‚Äôs a General in one of the four strongest pirate crews in the series, second only to Katakuri. In WCI, Luffy in Gear 4 struggled against commanders from the same crew, in Wano even an adept swordsman like Zoro was surprised by the strength of Hawkin‚Äôs strawman, he also got overwhelmed by Gyukimaru and Kamazo. Let‚Äôs not act like a 15 ft tall swordswoman worth 932 million would be an easy warm up fight  for any of the strawhats or supernova for that matter. After all, Oda went out of his way to say that she is ‚Äú[very tough](https://i.imgur.com/5uSS08z.jpg)‚Äù for a reason.

fi8xyo,MicrophoneWithAMouse,I gotta say I'm disappointed in a lot of y'all,"So there was a major reveal in this newest chapter that just dropped, and since it literally dropped less than 30 minutes ago I won't say what it was.  But that's a common courtesy everyone should try to practice.

Instead, I found out about that reveal earlier today when just idly scrolling through the sub.  I clicked on another post that was marked as a spoiler for other reasons (Denjiro) and more than half of the comments explicitly referenced the spoiler thread for the as-yet unreleased chapter.

I get it.  You're excited, it's cool, you want to talk about it.  But a lot of us, myself included, avoid the spoiler threads because we want to experience the chapter with a blank slate.  Please give us the courtesy of not taking away that choice.  I really don't want to have to avoid this subreddit as soon as the spoiler thread drops because people are too trigger-happy talking about them.  The rules state to not talk about spoilers until the chapter drops.  It's not that hard.  And it's really frustrating for literally everyone else when that rule gets broken.

I'm sorry for the rant, but I wanted to air this.  There was a panel this chapter that I really wanted to be shocked by.  I really wanted it to have a strong impact.

fi87sy,BlacBuddha,Vengeance in Wano - 974 spoilers,"Sorry for the length -- I'm curious what everyone in the reddit community is thinking as far as how Oda will tackle one of the major Themes of this arc: Vengeance.

Often times, revenge (or Avenge) is seen as a method of resolving issues in stories, especially in action. But Oda doesn't usually write in this black and white way in his solutions. 

WCI had such a heavy theme of parenting/guardianship. And, in that, he didn't make it black/white. Parents who were not present were on a spectrum of good and bad, from Judge to Pound; guardians who WERE present were also on a spectrum of good and bad, from Mother Caramel to BM to Capone (maybe even Jimbe with the Sun Pirates.) The spectrum offers the thought that committing to being a guardian doesn't make you virtuous in how you raise those children. Also (in Pound's case,) not raising your children doesn't mean you can't have a positive effect on them when you get the chance. \[I guess Judge helped as well\]

That brings me to Wano. There are a SHIT LOAD of people seeking vengeance in this arc. I know this arc is compared to Marineford, but that arc was not about Vengeance as Wano clearly is. So here are the people in pursuit of (specifically) revenge in Wano (let me know if I miss someone:)

* Orochi against Wano
* Kanjuro against Wano
* Kidd against Kaido
* Momonoske &amp; Scabbards against Kaido &amp; Orochi
* Denjiro against Orochi
* Big Mom against Luffy
* Kaido against Luffy
* Moria (if appears) against Kaido
* Maybe: Kidd/Hawkins against Appoo
* Maybe: Zoro against Orochi

Already, it's clear that revenge is not everything because the villains in this arc are only villains because of this vengeance. So, how do you all think Oda will resolve the arcs for those in pursuit of vengeance? Do you think any of them will get to inflict that revenge as a positive resolution? Will any non-Wano vengeful people make their way? Where the fuck is Shinobu?",9,1584138817,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fi87sy/vengeance_in_wano_974_spoilers/,OnePiece,1

So what can be done to bring Sanji and Zoro up enough for them to get to commander level. Both have had a few tune up fights this arc, Zoro with Killer, Fox guy and the fodder ninja, and Sanji with Page One, and the Yakuza. Both have clashed with Supernova‚Äôs, Zoro with Hawkins and Kyoshiro, and Sanji with Drake, but all these were left unfinished.

fi6s07,setu21,Strong slaves of Celestial Dragons being mind controlled,"I was thinking about Kuma being a slave of Celestial Dragons(CD) and how he got into that situation and why didn't he escape on his own.

We know that Kuma is a pretty strong character and he was even one of the shicibukai. We don't really know how he ended up as slave of CD but we can assume it has.to do with the deal he made with the world government. But what I'm wondering is if there are other strong people that are slaves of CD and why don't fhey escape.

We know CD like to collect unusual people to be their slaves, but they also want strong slaves that will be able to carry on the tasks that they give them. So there are probably some really strong people that are currently slaves of CD but we didn't see them. We know only of Kuma. 

But why wouldn't these characters fight their way through and escape. Well first reason for most might be that Ciper Pol and marines are there and they would catch them and once brought back to CD they would be punished so violently that it's better not to try to escape.

Second reason why I think no one escapes, and this is the theory part of this thread, is that CD or world goverment has put some things on these slaves to control their behavior so they never escape.

We saw some slaves in Sabaody when CD appeared and they were all having a clear mind with no signs of some mind or behavior control, but I think this is because they are not that strong and they would never try to escape becaus od Ciper Pol and marines.

While on the other hand, strong guys like Kuma, who are capable of escaping, het special treatment where they are put in mind or behavior control process which stops them from thinking on their own and puts them only jn obey mode.

We saw a use of this, when Kuma was protecting SHP's ship in Sabaody after time skip. He said to Franky that before Vegapunk finished his operation, to put in his task to protect SHP's ship until their return. So simar thing might be used on potential escapees to prevent them even trying to escape.

What do you guys think about this?

fi6e5m,1prozentIAS,Kidd joins luffy as 2nd division commander,"Whats your honest opinion?

I believe it was foreshadowed in Sabaody Arc.

Yeah yeah... i know all about Lawand Sanji. Hear me out

I see 2 possible ways here

1st.) Kidd dies or is so heavily defeted that the  Kidd pirates split up. Especially with the ""killer-smile"" character development in mind. 

Thats not gonna happen.

2nd.) Kidd deals some heavy blows on Kaido but is to weak and gets beaten up but not defeated entirely. 
Then Luffy will finish Kaido and Kidd will hold off Big Mom in combination with Law for a while. Both get destroyed. (I dont underestimate BM)

Luffy deals final blow on Big Mum. 

Kidd will see Luffy's Haki and development and finds a new path in Luffy's flag after Wano. 

Since the forming of the alliance Law is more of an ally than Nakama. Needless to say only the OP pirates have those sort of real allys like Roger (i assume) and Newgate. (Marineford arc)

Sanji is the cook and very OP, further in the future probably over Katakuri Level. But still, Luffy needs his food fresh on the Sunny.

fi4vwf,Piterno,Long Ring Long Land is... [Spoiler],"I was randomly jumping through time using my Toki-Toki no mi and... No, I mean, I was rereading chapter 304-5.

Long Ring Long Land is another member of the ancient alliance, alongside Jaya, Alabasta, and Wano. Look at its shape: a ring of circular islands; similar to the symbols of these other kingdoms.

It's described as a land where everyone and everything ""feels free"", so they grow longer and taller.  It's a land of adventure where the nomads that live there cross the islands every 3 years even though they don't need to. Sounds like the ancient kingdom to me; freedom being the most important thing.

My theory is that they've been waiting for something: the dawn of the world. Usopp comments that it will take 20 years to ""reunite with your people"" similar with what's going on now in Wano.

The tides rise and lower, going between being many islands and being a wall that separates the outside from the middle. My theory is also that this is a phenomenon similar to the Red Line's division of the ocean, so maybe they had the technology to make this kind of thing happen back then...

Counterpoint would be that the other ""rings"" of dots on symbols only have 8, rather than the 10 islands that Long Ring Long Land has. But it's very similar.

But what would be in the middle of the water to complete the image? Another island perhaps. I don't want to make any undue assumptions, but Raftel could be right there.",18,1584126312,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fi4vwf/long_ring_long_land_is_spoiler/,OnePiece,1

fi3dq9,EmmaNielsen,Stupid Question but could Ohara actually be.,"Raftal?  even if it isn't. I think there is way more to this Island, and I do not think it's utterly destroyed.

I'm re watching entire show,- and I know that Oda doesn't draw stuff for fun, whenever he does something there is an idea behind it. But what questions my sanity is that during the buster call upon Ohara, the ""Intelligent""  people, where busy dumping all their books out the window into the lake. Quoting ""Preserving knowledge for the future"" I'm no smart person, but my immediate though process of the following would be the books would be ruined in the lake, because.

book versus water + Aging = not good. 

So why would Intelligent people Quote that and dump the books like that?  My understanding is that the books are either sealed to withstand water, or made of a specific material that can't be destroyed and persevered in water. Like those are the only two things that somehow might make sense. 

So I do not know what Oda is thinking, but I've a feeling these books will re-surface. Robin will read them. I've a feeling that Ohara still exists.",6,1584120721,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fi3dq9/stupid_question_but_could_ohara_actually_be/,OnePiece,1

So to recap, he's increased his base strength, further enhanced his grasp of observation haki and future sight and gained an instructor who has successfully taught him advanced armament haki techniques.

fi0uf5,Yaahh,Help us understand what's going on with the traitor,"Normally I don't read spoilers but a friend urged me to read because he desperately wanted to discuss a few things regarding Kanjuro. We found a few points to be confusing and unsatisfying in a logical manner. So we waited for the scans to get more information. Now that we did, we are still confused and wonder what the community thinks about this and/or if we have missed something.

A few points:

* When Orochi talks to Kanjuro, he looks about the same age as he is when working for Odens' father. So he met Kanjuro about the same time as Oden did. 

* Kanjuro is introduced to Kaido as an insane person without emotions. He also states it himself.

* Kanjuro seems to be an outstanding actor.

Now here are the problems. Why is it that Kanjuro is that loyal to Orochi when he knows both, Orochi and Oden, for about the same time? It would've made much more sense if Orochi raised and manipulated Kanjuro after his traumatic experience. But at the time Wano was persecuted, Orochi himself was a kid so they are about the same age.

In addition, we are told he is emotionless. This explains, why even after experiencing Odens'/Scabbards' great character/s and feats, he doesn't feel connected enough to question his motives regarding betraying them. But on page 10, he says himself ""I experienced joy and sorrow together with you..."" If he has no emotions, how can he experience those? And if he isn't really that emotionless, how come that after all those events, especially Odens' sacrifice, he didn't have a change of perspective?

Lastly, his acting skills. Yes, he was the child of an acting family. But even if he was taught early to act, it can't have been enough time to reach this current skill. Especially after his traumatic experience, acting can't have been something of a priority for him.

I found the chapter to be great. But can't deny that Kanjuro, to us, felt a bit too much like a plot device.",7,1584111199,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fi0uf5/help_us_understand_whats_going_on_with_the_traitor/,OnePiece,1
fi0u30,DragonFistSabo,"Luffy""s CoC","Is there any possibility that Luffy already has advanced CoC? What if a Advanced CoC is the ability to use the kings disposition to make others Obey/follow without imposing on their wills.

Like when Mihawk stated that luffy's greatest skill was his ability to bring enemies and friends alike together. Like what if people want to be their for luffy, rather than him having to force them to do it. What if Advanced CoC is as simple as basic respect without the need to have to demand it from others. 

Maybe that's why its so rare, having the ability for everyone to elect you because they see that you would be the best for the job. Which in reality is very very difficult, look at all our politics. I was reading this manhwa/LN Solo Leveling where the main character is treated as this king by his soldiers after he defeats them. And they aren't just his puppets, he is their king, they truly ""WANT"" to serve him they feel joy in fighting with him. What if that's similar to a form of advanced CoC? Where these monsters, like zoro, sanji, katakuri, sincerely want to follow luffy just by the basic aura/will he gives off. When people want to be there for u without being imposed upon, they are truly showing u Love/Respect/Honor. Isn't that what it means to be a true king?

But Rayleigh also mentioned that she might discover something different from what they(Roger and co.) discovered. 
I know I am stretching this a little but this might link to the fact that Roger was too early for reaching raftel and what Roger learned from the island might be completely different from what the straw hats will discover in the future because of the 20 year prophecy by toki.

In an industry where anything can just switch on you so quickly; this man has managed to make one of the greatest pieces of fiction ever and that‚Äôs not even getting into the pure of metrics of sales and statistics. Never have I been so enthralled in a piece of fiction as I have One Piece; this genuine praise of a man who has enriched the world with what he has brought from the depths of his mind.

fhvvmy,KingDworld,A different perspective on Haki,"Well I'm sure some people might get at my throat but I will try not to be too illogical.

While haki has been explained and divided into categories, it still stays so blurry as we keep on discovering new things on it.

The most recent one, the ryuo, is not only a different name for haki but rather a different way to use it. Like the mantra was slightly different from the observation haki we now know. ""The ability to cut diamond and the inability to cut paper if you want to"" means mastering your sword at the highest level and by doing so turning your will into physical reality. And that's something Zoro was able to do before learning any haki. Add to that all the other pre ts manifestations of haki that stay to this day unexplained.

Recently again, the vivre cards revealed that the rokushiki is Kind of a preliminary form to the haki and that information caused confusion and some people called bullshit on that. I'm not here to argue about the legitimacy of the databooks, but it seems that haki is way more diffuse than what we think it is.

I think the reason for that reaction is because the haki was introduced as a magical way to touch devil fruit users that Luffy had to TRAIN with a master in order to unlock. So we subconsciously consider haki more like a technique among others in the series rather than a concept/ability while we know that ANY living creature can use it without any master at all.

So my final take on this is that haki is just the physical incarnation of a strong will. Haki could just be the ability to turn your will into a flowing energy that can either affect your body or affect other people or matter itself and since you are able to use it, you can feel it from other living creature or objects endowed with it. So people in OP world categorized it in three groups of abilities that rely on the same use of haki and some of them theorized techniques out of it that are the most commonly known. But it doesn't imply that there has to be a hierarchy or a set limited list of things you can do or must be able to do if you use haki. For example, you could use haki to strengthen your body but not be able to touch devil fruit users yet or vice versa. Or make your body as hard as diamond or as light and pliable as paper. Everything is up to your own will and experience.

In the future of the series, we will surely learn more about it and its origins and maybe at the end of the day, every ability we saw in the series might be related to haki in some way shape or form and even devil fruits might turn out to be included. When that happens, people will definitely diss. IMHO I think it could still be great because it wouldn't alter the diversity of abilities in the series since it wouldn't be linear and hierarchical.

Finally I think haki is the second best shonen power system behind the nen. Both are based on will power and juggle with crazy unlimited possibilities without being over the top.",11,1584084430,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhvvmy/a_different_perspective_on_haki/,OnePiece,1

fhv9jk,SavageRage206,Just Another Gear 5 Theory,"&lt;(spoilers)&gt;

Like the title says I was thinking of a theory, maybe that other people have thought of but wanted to see what others would say. I was watching King of Lightning's vis live reaction of chapter 973 and something he said caught my attention; Luffy and Oden have alot of similarities and that something that happened to Oden similarly may happen to Luffy.

Let's say Luffy loses, maybe even all the straw hats, regardless Luffy is tasked with being boiled for one hour, if he survives the time he and the straw hats get to live if not they die anyways. He uses armament to harden his body and holds up the straw hats or does it solo. And survives and he looks a bit smaller and shrivelled up. Tossing away the straw hats to run or just plopping out of the cauldron, it storming still and the weather is getting colder as Kaido and Orochi laugh and sentences him to death, Kaido gives him the same honor as he did Oden and readies a pistol. Luffy still clad in near full body haki, breathes in the cold air as the rain falls upon him and exhales what he thinks is his last breathes saying, ""I will still be the King of the Pirates."" Kaido will shoot him but the bullet will just ping off of Luffy's body which is even stronger then his armament was before; entering Gear 5.

Sorry for the long winded story but I did some studying and when you heat rubber it shrinks and shrivels up quite a bit but when it's cold the opposite occurs expanding and hardening.",4,1584080575,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhv9jk/just_another_gear_5_theory/,OnePiece,1

fhuymj,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 21: Luffy vs Buggy Conclusion,"Yes, this is my first time reading One Piece

We start out the chapter with Buggy attacking Nami, proving that he‚Äôs not completely stupid. It almost feels like the opposite of Luffy, where Buggy is stupid in things that Luffy is intelligent in, and vice versa. Luffy crotch kicking Buggy has no right to be as funny as it was, probably because Oda can draw exaggerated faces like no other Mangaka I‚Äôve seen. Luffy telling Nami to run before she gets hurt is another moment of him looking out for other people, which was nice. Nami tells Buggy that it‚Äôs her treasure now, to which Buggy responds by using his final move, the Bara Bara Festival. I do want to draw attention to the stripes on his shirt signifying where he splits, someone told me that last chapter and I thought it was really cool. I think Buggy‚Äôs Devil Fruit is really creative, and I like that Oda is thinking outside the box when making these abilities up. Like every overpowered attack though, Buggy‚Äôs move has an Achilles heel, his feet have to stay grounded. Luffy starts messing with Buggy‚Äôs feet, which is just another excuse to give Buggy some amazing faces. Seriously, I cannot stress enough how great of a job Oda did in this department. 

&amp;nbsp;

Nami slams a treasure bag into Buggy, which he catches. This next little scene is good for a couple of reasons. Luffy attacking Buggy mirrors how he acted when Buggy tried to attack Zoro. It‚Äôs clear Luffy expects a fair fight, and Buggy isn‚Äôt that kind of guy. But this also shows that Buggy cares less about killing Luffy, and more about the preservation of his treasure. We get another great shot of Luffy nailing Buggy in the side of the head, and with that the fight is pretty much over. I do like the touch of Buggy‚Äôs head landing in a pile of treasure. Luffy acknowledging Boodle was really nice too, it shows that he doesn‚Äôt just see him as someone in the way. Luffy gets the Grand Line map, and Buggy tries to call all of his body parts, only to realize Nami ties them up (another weakness of the Bara Bara). Also little Buggy looks funny as hell. We get Luffys big finisher, Gomu Gomu No Bazooka, and with that, Buggy the Clown Pirate is defeated.",17,1584078775,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhuymj/one_piece_journey_chapter_21_luffy_vs_buggy/,OnePiece,1

fhua5w,zoro_mihawk,[spoiler] The numbers,"I have an interesting thought about the numbers from beast pirates. So far we do not have enough information about the numbers. All we know is they are giant in size. They seem to have horns and look scary. 

Now what do we know about the Minks? Here‚Äôs the description from onepiece wiki:
‚ÄúIn order to transform, a mink would need to look at the full moon for a period of time until the transformation is complete. During transformation, the mink's hair grows exponentially as well as their body becoming significantly larger, and they emit an electric charge. Along with their altered appearances, their strength and speed also vastly increase. This form is strong enough, that when a single mink transformed, it caused panic among the members of the Big Mom Pirates‚Äù

We also know that the Minks have a long history with Wano. 

Let‚Äôs take an example, Pekoms was afraid of turning into his sulong form as he wasn‚Äôt sure if he could control it. Implying that he could go berserk in that form. 

Now I see a very close similarity between the numbers and the sulong form(don‚Äôt ask me for the specifics, I don‚Äôt have an answer. It‚Äôs just my head canon and speculation)

What if the numbers are minks that went into their sulong form and couldn‚Äôt get back to being normal? They could have gone out of control. Or they have awakened to a state where they can stay in the sulong form permanently and still have control?

fhtztz,StrawHatJD,Quick Appreciation For Oda," I know we praise Oda for being this amazing writer, but goddamn.

 I‚Äôve never read or watched a single series that has had the same beautifully written storyline as the Wano Arc is.

 Oda introduces Momosuke and Kinemon in 2013 in Punk Hazard. After giving us a small bit of info on them we‚Äôre brought to Dressrosa to another samurai (Kanjuro) and learn more about them (Momosuke not being Kinemons son, etc.)

 Then there is Zou with the info dump of the Minks and Kozukis alliance and a vague history, and a pause for WCI and now we‚Äôre here. Oda has worked 7 years in the background bringing these side characters to feel like Straw Hats (at least in my opinion).

 I thought about this in class today and I‚Äôm really just blown away by how amazing Oda is as a writer and how much the world outside anime underrates how amazing One Piece is.

 I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm actually prepared to say goodbye to Momosuke and Kinemon. It‚Äôs been a hell of a journey.",14,1584073403,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhtztz/quick_appreciation_for_oda/,OnePiece,1

This time though Akainu pierced Squard killing him, I feel like that could have been full circle with Akainu convincing Squard to turn his back on Whitebeard and Ace, to being the reason Ace survived stopping Akainu from achieving his goal by turning his back literally and figuratively on Akainu. In a way in that situation Akainu would have caused his own downfall as Squard might not have done that originally if not for his betrayal on Whitebeard. Just a cool idea I thought of as Squard isn't currently relevant in the story but Ace being alive could have been. Like Ace could have been a current character in Wano in someway, possibly relating to the obvious card theme of Kaido, Doffy, and Ace's crews or O-Tama. Imagine the bounty Ace could have had after Marineford lol. Just a fun little idea but I enjoy the way Oda writes his own story and only wanna see more of it!

fhs1y8,Jimbediesspoiler3d2y,Law and Kiado,"I was re readimg around chapter 699 and the start of the Luffy and Law alliance. 

When they first started the alliance, law approached Luffy with a plan to take down one of the yonko. So a millions chapters later we are nearing the end of laws plan.

I do know he was ready to die to fudge up Doffy, but originally he had thought out a way to take down a yonko.

Why? Why does he want to take down a yonko. Hear me out. 

-It's shown law can switch bodies and when the bodies are switched you can use that users DF. Franky used choppers monster point. 

- Kaido seemingly can't die. One of Laws abilities is 'eternal youth"" (We don't know exactly the limits tho)

What if law wants to swap bodies with Kaido and Kaido will be so happy he is in a body that dies that he uses the eternal youth power on somebody and then dies and then law becomes the most powerful beast.

fhryz5,greenchars,Just done reading all the chapters from 001 to 973! I have some theories about the next arc after Wano," I love how subtle is the whole next arc build, but it's pretty clear for me now- 

1. Zou and Wano share the same fate - i believe Zou (the elephant) is aiming for Wano, as the Kozuki clan and the minks are a sworn family that both awaits for the ""new force that will change the world"". no wonder he was willing to obey only Momo's words and not Luffy's.

2. The ""new force"" describes the two kings- it's pretty clear one of the kings is actually a queen- Shirahoshi, as Roger himself indicated so. surprisingly, i dont think Luffy is the other king, because the sea kings were the same who murmur about their kings in front of roger, yet they didn't identify luffy as their king at the fishermen island arc, in fact, they were surprised he can hear them, like roger could. my headcanon here would say the other king is, once again, not a king but an another queen- Vivi. Both the Fishermen Island and Alabasta Kingdom are the black sheeps of the Celestial Dragons. 

Butttt, whoever is the second king isn't my main point- the era of the two kings is right around the corner, at the end of the wano arc. Oden and his wife signified that something at the end of the current era in wano will cause turmoil and shake in the world, Oden even told his wife to simply jump 20 years ahead and see the future she waited for finally happening (but she refused), and he made sure his loyal samurai will make sure to open Wano to the world when it's time- my guess here is that's the downfall of Big Mom and Kaido. 

  
 3. With the new haki ability Luffy gained thanks to Hyogoro and is aiming to use at Kaido, I realized the battle between Roger and Whitebeard has briefly shown us a small and hidden, yet very important info, in front of our eyes- when their sword clashed, their swords didnt touch each other at all- that's because they were covered with haki. 

My note here is that their haki wasn't the kind of Internal Destruction Haki. if both of the swords were to be covered with the destruction haki that luffy has just learned to use- what would become of everything that touches it or nearby it? perhaps the new haki ability is more dangerous than we think? with a powerful enough user, it can simply erase everything that's nearby it- and luffy is.. strong. if both the internal destruction haki and the protection haki are simply application of controling the flowing haki (with the only difference of one being teachable and the other an inheretance) - then what would become of luffy's Haoshoku haki if he can control the haki flow? can he perhaps not only cause people to faint- but to destroy them from inside out? maybe that's why animals and fish fear or run away when there's a Haoshoku user nearby? an awaken Haoshoku would be a huge problem for everybody, not a single DF user would withstand it..

4. Hence why Luffy can't learn about the truth of the One Piece before he's strong enough. He can only get stronger by encountering strong enemies, we were told that time over time, and as he progress his abilities are becoming more and more OP in the world of One Piece. If Luffy is indeed ""Joy Boy""- then can't we consider Joy Boy being a entity that mastered the Haki control to the point it's now a destruction weapon?",9,1584064269,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhryz5/just_done_reading_all_the_chapters_from_001_to/,OnePiece,1

fhq7as,MarineRitter,The Reason Blackbeard was looking for Yami Yami no Mi,"On top of its ability to nullify Devil Fruit users, even among logias, Yami Yami no mi is a weird Devil Fruit. It's the only logia that can't nullify the damage to the user by having the said user turn into its element.

And why is that? Well, simply put, because there's constantly light around. If what I'm thinking is correct, Blackbeard would need a pitch black situation to turn into darkness itself. Does that [remind you of anything](https://68.media.tumblr.com/908e062ec2196439dd2bf738be6710ea/tumblr_inline_os4iaoDYVh1sg3o5d_540.png)?

Under the blanket, Teach was probably able to become darkness itself and somehow absorb Whitebeard's power (I have no idea how he did this so I won't speculate).

However, let's try to tie in something else into the mix - a scenario where Teach would be the strongest person in the world. And that scenario would be possible under one condition - if the whole planet was engulfed in darkness. Something like darkness via an eclipse caused by using Uranus to line up the moon/s in front of the sun is one crackpot theory that comes to mind.

In that scenario, Teach would be able to use all the darkness around him, which would be practically everything...


But that's not all - let's discuss the meaning of D. while we're at it. Recently, there's been a lot of talk about Luffy being the one to bring a new Dawn to the world, which is what I think Luffy's D. represents. However, I find it likely that Teach's D. represents Dusk, which would tie in perfectly with the theme of Teach and Luffy being the opposites of one another. Just think about it - by beating Teach, Luffy will quite literally bring the new Dawn. What are your thoughts?

**TL;DR** - the D. in Teach's name represents Dusk, and he wants to engulf the world in a state of constant night which would make his Devil Fruit would be the most OP ability in the world. Luffy's D. represents Dawn, which would make the prophecies about dawnbringers literal.",19,1584056935,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhq7as/the_reason_blackbeard_was_looking_for_yami_yami/,OnePiece,1

For Example, Pudding Pudding marine commodore in the 77th Branch of the Marines and sanji's Pudding that 3  puddings, Pudding has 3 eyes and san means 3, so 3+3+3=9, Zoro in Ashura form have 9 swords, there also was 9 red scabbards two of them are minks so 9+9=18-2=16 this is age of sanji's Pudding, 16 is 3 years above the age of consent in Japan, 3 of red scabbards stayed in pass math don't lie.

fhpp6p,danomite42,Scabbard=Strawhat,"Just wanted to see what ppls thoughts were on if one of the scabbards will join Luffy and the Strawhats once the Wano Arc is over.  

I've been re reading the manga lately and it seems like after every major arc Luffy gets a new Nakama in some way.  And if Oden eventually set out with the pirate king, then surely one of the scabbards will also set out with Luffy right?  Maybe one of the ways Wano can open it's countries borders is by journeying the seas and spreading the word to the people of the world? My bet right now would be Kinemon, since he's the one we've known the longest, he can't simply have such an intense backstory without a big build up? Am I the only one who feels this? Luffy also asked him to join his crew when he saw half of Kinemons body on punk hazard lol.

fhopmw,Pickle8314,Nami might actually have the hardest dream out of the straw hats,"So I was trying to rank the strawhat dreams from easiest to hardest and It went like

8th: Ussop, becoming a brave warrior of the sea really isn't that hard and you could honestly argue that he's already achieved that


7th: Franky, while creating a ship that is good enough to travel the grand line and new world is hard there is no risk involved in doing so, Tom managed to do this without even leaving water 7 and if one attempt fails you can easily try again


6th: Brook, the only reason this dream is so hard is because he made it hard by joining the straw hats if he decided to go back from thriller bark to the beginning of the grand line with his strength he could make it back pretty easily


5th: Chopper you really don't have to make an enemy out of anyone doing this. In fact you could probably join the World Government and become well know enough as a doctor prodigy to be protected and having the most reach in the world they would make it way easier to be able to accomplish choppers dream

4th: Robin, finding the secret of the void century is tough you immediately make an enemy of the world government but it's easier to do this in secret without drawing to much attention to yourself like later entrys and normal archeologist like the people from Ohara were pretty close to finding the answer without finding the poneglyph


3rd: Zoro, while debatable I would argue that mihawk is Yonko level and to surpass that Zoro would have to become that strong as well and as chapter 923 showed us, even now no one one the crew is anywhere near Yonko level despite how hard they might have trained and the fact that 2 years with training with the best swordsman in the world still doesn't put him close to a Yonko really shows how hard this one is

2nd: Luffy, this is basically Zoro's dream but harder you have to become at least Yonko level, gather a crew up, sail the grand line and new world which are extremely unpredictable while being chased by the world government and (once you've made a name for yourself and are close to finding the one piece) all 4 Yonko and after you become king of the pirates and find one piece you will basically have every pirate, marine and bounty hunter after your head for probably the rest of your life

1st: Nami, so why is she number 1 for the simple reason that she has mark every island in the world, including all 4 blue's the calm belt grand line and new world with the Yonko territory the all blue and, oh yeah, Laugh Tale. Which would mean finding/stealing the road poneglyph and you'd have to be at least yonko level to do that so you'd make a name for yourself and be labeled a pirate so you'd have to go through all the crap I listed earlier that's involved in becoming king of the pirates. There's also the fact that the world is huge in one piece the straw hats have only gone on one path in the grand line theirs got to be at least 5 different routes so that's 5 trips up the grand line and new world. There is no easy way to create a world map if she's trying to make one as complicated as ours so that's why Nami's is by far the hardest dream of the straw hats.

Sanji is not on this list because his dream is either impossible if the all blue doesn't exist or easy plus if Nami's dream is fulfilled then it would involve his dream getting fulfilled as well.

So do you agree or not I'd like to hear your lists",25,1584051161,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhopmw/nami_might_actually_have_the_hardest_dream_out_of/,OnePiece,1

fhoako,DragonFistSabo,Mihawk Haki?,"Does Mihawk have advanced haki? IMHO i believe Mihawk has all types of haki and for sure has both advanced CoA and CoO.

When the argument on mihawk being not being able to cut jozu comes up i always think its bs. I've always been on the side that the slash mihawk sent towards WB was just a regular slash without/very basic haki.

If mihawk wanted to wound jozu he would have added some advanced ryou the hyou described it. If sentomaru used the first level of advanced haki, like deflecting stuff, I'm pretty sure the worlds sww can also do it. This is just my head cannon. The fact that Mihawk, like shanks, froze everyone in the war as he made his move showed that he is more than just second or third commander level. Mihawk was just at the war to kill some time. Not actually fight the WB pirates to spill blood. just my thoughts.

I think Mihawk is atleast top 10 strongest characters in OP atm. I think oda is just saving him till the so he doesn't cheapen the phrase ""World's Strongest ----"". Whitbeard the WS Man had the illness to dilute the phrase but still showed how fearsome that title was until death. Kaido the WS creature completely wrecked Luffy who arguably was at the edge of first commander level with barely 1 hit. 

Mihawk the WS swordsman has to be a monster. Even if mihawk is slightly weaker than Shanks, someone who imo could win 4 out of 10 fights, should tell us that he is the real fifth yonko.

fho0zc,delicateenergy,How Zoro will gain/lead the samurai....,"Okay in chapter 822, we see Zoro say that he will be leading the samurai in no time.

In chapter 921 we see Shutenmaru talk about the samurai not having any leader to guide them.

The two candidates for leading the samurai would be either Momo(due to heritage and bravery?) and Zoro(self-explanatory)

I think the way Zoro will gain and lead the samurai is through this...

What do we know of both Oden and Ryuma? They both cut a dragon, although the latter killed his. I know there are some who just dislike this idea, but they dislike it for no good reason.

Lets look at the foreshadowing, we have Zoro cutting down a dragon in punk hazard, we have his samurai speech,  we have Ashura Douji's speech and we have Enma which cut a dragon before.

Do I think Zoro will kill Kaido? No

Do I think Zoro will achieve a feat between killing and cutting Kaido? yes (meaning I think he will give Kaido a serious cut)

Also, Ryuma said that Shusui had chosen Zoro(If i remembered correctly, correct me if I am wrong). We also know Shusui was taken from Zoro, but I believe after he achieves such a feat at the end of Wano, people will see him worthy of it, but he might not take it due to it being a treasure of Wano.",28,1584048670,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fho0zc/how_zoro_will_gainlead_the_samurai/,OnePiece,1
fhnokq,silentdrestrikesback,Momo and Kaido....," Well lemme explain in full detail, We know Zoans enhance a persons abilities no matter the type
 We know there can never be two types of DF, there can be different versions , but not exact type(Human-Human fruits and Snake-Snake Fruit)
 Now to Momo, Tho he can transform and create clouds , his Dragon form lacks any of the physical buffs of a Zoan type DF.



 We know in universe, Vega punk deemed it a failure and abandoned the idea of Artificial DF altogether, But we were never given a reason for this 180 change in mindset, Tho Kaido's DF name isn't confirmed , its safe to say that if Oda is following a pattern for Mystical Zoans, Phoenix isn't laid by any bird nor mates with any bird, it ""manifests"" , The same is true with eastern Dragons, Budda also , tho being a man in the Buddhist religion, his Origin is mostly unknown , at least his birth, Now back to DFs, If we follow this pattern, Oda is still keeping the lore of our world by simply making these powers DFs




 Now to Momo, He has the same version of Kaido's unofficial DF, Even tho it is impossible, This is where I inject just one part of FMAB, The requirements for philosopher's stone is death (on a large scale but still death) The requirements for the manifestation of a new DF is the death of the previous user, What if the reason why Vega punk abandoned the idea is cuz he can't make a DF if the current  user is still alive, Any further experimentation is fruitless, Thus a failure.


 So if Kaido dies where would it go,Another fruit or Momo ??

fhmdnt,GarringMan,Luffy VS A Straw Hat Death,"I see a lot of people expect a Straw Hat to die within the final arcs of One Piece but I don't really get it. Why would Oda do that and what would that add to the finale aside from making it bittersweet? It's gonna be bittersweet enough saying goodbye to the series. For one thing, Oda's always been explicit about providing happy endings, but for another, I feel like it would invalidate Luffy's will as the protagonist, as a D and as a conclusion to his character arc.

The way Luffy is, the One Piece isn't his end goal, it's a means to a farther end. We actually don't entirely know what that end is but he's given us some pretty good hints. Luffy craves true freedom for himself and everyone else, he has genuine trouble understanding why anyone wouldn't fight for it. Which makes sense, almost no one in his young life couldn't defend themselves, and at the very least no real harm came to them.

That's why the Water 7 Saga hit him so hard, he's used to strong willed people who are riddled with confidence that usually works out for them one way or another. He was about to lose 2 of his best friends because they thought they were too weak for their will to matter. Then he decides to become so strong that he won't lose anyone to that fear ever again. Then Marineford hits and he learns that even then he wasn't strong enough to stop a death and for the first time seemingly in his entire life he doubts his claim to be Pirate King.

That's a big deal, Luffy is a person who greets people with declarations that he will be Pirate King as if to say ""If this will make us fight down the line, let's just get it out of the way now."" It's his primary motivation in life. When asked what Pirate King means to him he calls it being the freest. More free than anyone else. Ace's death didn't free him from anything, it tied him down. The only thing that brought him back was remembering that he still had everyone else.

Facing that trauma didn't teach him to accept death, that's never been how Luffy operates. It wouldn't be much easier for him to cope with the death of anyone else close to him. He actively triggered a time skip to make sure that everyone was strong enough that it would never happen again. Getting the One Piece isnt the end for Luffy, becoming Pirate King is a first step into something else. Luffy wants to be the freest man with the freest crew and that's not possible if any of them die. One Piece doesn't discuss misery and trauma to feed into it, it discusses them to show how people can overcome it and outright defy it. 

The D clan Defies, Luffy doesn't have to suffer to be Pirate King. One Piece never glorifies trauma and pain, it leaves wounds that don't just disappear. Most character quirks are more than likely coping mechanisms. Like Se√±or Pink's outfit and Zoro's rejection of stairs. What would be the point of adding on more of that in the final cour? It's kind of the same for Shanks, there was a reason Oda brought Pell back. He wants happy endings, there's nothing wrong with that. We don't get enough happy endings in real life, we NEED more.",14,1584042735,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhmdnt/luffy_vs_a_straw_hat_death/,OnePiece,1

fhktw8,Zelina4991,Wano Country structure.,"This post is marked as spoiler for anime-only watchers\*\*\*I suppose.

I just want to discuss something that I've been noticing, and I'm sure many others have noticed as well. I think there's something to be said about it, for sure.

Specifically, when it comes to the Wano Arc, it does seem that there are a lot more things happening off-panel than other arcs. The thing is, I  get the feeling that Oda probably made a deal with Toei Animation. I think Toei wants more time to shine and expand upon Oda's work, which results in Oda skipping over certain things quickly. This also probably has to do with the fact that the anime is very close to where the manga is, so it does serve as a way to extend the anime. 

There is also a matter of what exactly is being skipped over; specifically, it's mainly fights and some character moments. I'm not sure if Oda wants to skip over fights intentionally or if it's Toei that wants to expand upon those fights a lot. Therefore, to an extent, I do blame Toei partially for how the Wano Arc is going, in the manga. I get the feeling that if Toei wasn't so close to where the manga is, then things would be different. If Toei was seasonal for One Piece, then I do genuinely think things would be very different for the manga.

It's definitely possible that the reason why he skips over fights now is because the Wano Arc has a final battle, which consists of many battles happening at once. I suppose it depends upon whether or not the final battle will make up for the lack of battles prior to the war.

fhkqvc,Subliminal_Syllables,Numbers Theory,"So far we are 2/2 with the Wano theories. We have proven denjiro is kyoshiro and Kanjuro is the traitor. 
I believe that kanjuro created the numbers. The Numbers have an odd silhouette that reminds me of a children's book ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Ryunosuke the adorable mess was a red herring. Kanjuro has a vast control of his abilities and the numbers are his masterpiece with much more detail and fine art. If you remember Ryunosuke showed signs of life when it struggled to climb up the coastline. I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers eat,drink and sleep. Maybe the numbers dissolved when kanjuro traveled thru time and they were brought back to life.",1,1584036771,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhkqvc/numbers_theory/,OnePiece,1

fhkla6,Aleeex-,Theory on the purpose of the moons SPOILER,"The moon seems to be special in One Piece. The moon buffs the minks, allies of the kozuki clan have a crescent moon tattoo and an ancient civilization lived there who left a prophecie which will probably play a bigger role in the future. We probably dont know everything yet.

One weird thing is that we have never seen more than 1 moon in the sky even though the ohara library shows that there are 6 moons and one of them even has its own moon. Why do they even have that model? I thought they studied the void century and not astronomy? And why havent we ever seen more than 1 moon in the sky?

This probably happens but maybe only once every 20 years? 100 years? 800 years?

What if once every 800 years all moons are visible? What if the Roger Pirates learned that at Laugh Tale and thats why they knew they were too early and they are not the chosen ones. Thats why Oden told Toki to send Momo and the others 20 years into the future and thats why Roger started the great pirate era because he knew that the chosen one will be born in the next generation. Rayleigh also knew that the chosen one will be born in the next generation and he believes that the chosen one is Luffy.

But what could happen (pure speculation):

1. **Minks get an insane buff.** On top of that the minks seem to be very important for the story because they are a race which is 1000 years old and they have connections to the Kozuki Clan which is somehow tied to the void century.
2. **Special islands will rise up.** God Valley could be an island like that which appeared but later disappeared once the moons disappear. Sen Goku didnt say that God Valley was destroyed but that it disappeared without a trace. He also mentioned that the World Government wanted to keep that island secret? But why? What if this island is somehow tied to the void century and only under specific conditions it appears? What if the celestial dragon part of the story is just there to hide the truth? Because... Why are they even there? Was it their resort? Sen Goku is very serious about this topic thats why I dont believe that. The public will believe this story because the Rocks Pirates were known to be a terrorist group and Garp is marine so it make sense that he protects the celestial dragons...
3. **Uranus can be used.** We know basically nothing about Uranus and we dont know much about the moon, but many think that the egg on Rogers ship could be Uranus and what if this egg hatches once all moons are visible? 

Its all just speculation and I might be completly wrong but I think its kinda weird that we know so little about the moons even though they have such a special role in the story. There must be something void century/end of one piece related to the moons and I think we will find out in the future.",13,1584036189,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhkla6/theory_on_the_purpose_of_the_moons_spoiler/,OnePiece,1

fhkeof,anvinhnd,The Wano theme of Inherited Will and Individual Dream,"Firstly, I have to disclaim that, despite the fanciful title, I only have some discrete shower thoughts. I just want to post this to have people join and further discuss.

Everyone can see the prominent theme of Inherited Will in Wano arc, at first from Oden to his retainers and Momo, then from the Kurozumi clan to Orochi.

Also, relatively perpendicular to that theme, there is a theme of, for lack of a better term, Familial Injustice and Rebellion: Orochi was chastised (before cooking up the long-term plan, also chastised is a mild word in their cases), Oden's retainers and Momo are chastised (from the past, leading to the present, at least officially), all because of their respective families' deeds (in fact, perhaps only the deeds of a few people of their respective families). In other words, their individuality are cast aside just because of their lineages. In addition, one can argue that Oden was treated badly by his lineage: he wanted to see the world and opened the country, but the burden of generations of Kozuki clan stood in his way.

In all above cases, so far only Oden found a way and rebelled against his lineage. Orochi in a way is enslaved by his clan's will (justifiably, given his past situations, but still he cannot break the cycle of hatred, although in fact he was kinda manipulated by the two elders). And, last but not least, Momo. Momo is also enslaved by his father's will and the burden of Wano. Ok, enslaved may be too strong a word, and Momo seems to be fine. In other words, apparently, his father's will is his chosen will, his father's burden is his chosen burden, his father's dream is his chosen dream. So far so good ... right? Imho, the conversation between Kaido and Momo in chapter 973 revealed a hint of something else. Momo has an individuality and an agency, but he cannot and should not present it now because of his duty to his parents, to his father's retainers, to Kozuki clan, to Wano and its people. Imho, he is doing the right thing. But, what about after the victory? What's next for him? Realistically speaking, should he rule Wano at the age of 8? Ethically speaking, should he continue the cycle of hatred between Kozuki and Kurozumi? (in this particular thing, imho, Oden did something right, he had no hatred to Kurozumi clan, only to Orochi because of Toki and Wano people)

Actually, the above thoughts came to me out of confusion. I don't know which message Oda wants to give to the readers through those relatively competing themes. For sure, everyone gets the message of ""not judging people by their lineages, but by their characters"" from Oda, but how about the theme of Inherited Will which is passed through familial relation (loosely speaking, as Oden's retainers are basically his family) ?",7,1584035511,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhkeof/the_wano_theme_of_inherited_will_and_individual/,OnePiece,1

2. He has the time power that Toki had. We seem to see all the DF in Wano recycled (barrier/clone). This would mean that he hasn‚Äôt fasted for three years, but rather he just came from three years in the past.

Like ok maybe the plan depends on Orochi being alive and what not. But after going through 20 years of that would you really jump in front of a man you hate to parry a killing blow. 
And why would the plan require Orochi to be alive anyways. What would Kaido do exactly? the strawhats could hide for a bit and then storm him with all the samurai and what not",19,1584013177,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhezef/spoiler_so_about_blue_perm_guy/,OnePiece,1
fhew3p,YajanBasel,Ope ope no mi and No. Of Immortal Peoples.,"I think there are many immortal peoples in the OP world.

People with Ope ope no mi powers may have done the immortality surgery in the past when they were certain of their imminent death.

For example,  A seriously ill person or very old person who has ope ope no mi power could use it to make their beloved person immortal. They wouldn't want the powers to be wasted with their death.

So, During 800 years, there may have been 10 generations (assuming ope ope no mi user lives for 80 years.). There might be 10 or 9 guys who are immortal. 

Also, considering the powers of Ope Ope no mi, it might have been in possession of World Government and might have later stolen from them to reach Trafalgar Law. Which suggests that most of immortal peoples (if they exist) are in the World Government. 

Sorry if I missed something or bad grammar.

fhdosa,yaxy97,Jack the Punching Bag,"It feels a lot like Jack the Drought was introduced in the show as a punching bag, and more importantly a power scaling device. He was the first character introduced with the big B bounty, and had an exact bounty of 1,000,000,000. Not like Katakuri who had a not so round figure. 

I feel his point is basically showcasing the strength levels of the people who can whoop him. Scabbards don't have a bounty, so they had Inu and Neko spar with him in turns and then Ashura confidently attack him alone, thus laying the base that these characters are of the tier that can take on YCs. He is literally a joke to King and Queen, and is the stupidest fishman ever for eating a devil fruit.

We know that objects can eat devil fruits and thanks to that gaining life for example Funkfreed or Lasso. If we fed a devil fruit with human human model devil fruit or some zoan type would it turn them into human or animal with devil fruit powers or would they just explode. We could get a new character in one piece universe thanks to that. Image  devil fruit with legs, arms and grumpy face. It could work with the yami yami no mi since it is ""the most evil of all devil fruits"" and thus i think possesing the strongest soul among them.

fhcqa0,neilnoahbanares,[Wano Arc] Go D. Ussopp vs,"**Go D. Ussopp vs 10 Numbers**

Its a popular theory but I want to add the exact details of what chapter and page it is said so check the chapter as shown below.

[\[Chapter 221 page 13\]](https://w11.mangafreak.net/Read1_One_Piece_221)

We see the giant shadows of Shandorians casted from Skypiea to the Sea and they think its a Monster. after the incident on the next chapter.

[\[Chapter 222 page 2\]](https://w11.mangafreak.net/Read1_One_Piece_222)

We see the panel Ussopp lying to Chopper about if he get's serious, he could beat those monsters and added that he beat **10 Giants** in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving to Wano Arc

&amp;#x200B;

We are introduced to the existence of Numbers in the Beast pirate crew, and it is safe to assume the Beast pirate's crew is based on the deck of cards. King (13), Queen (12), Jack (11), Numbers (1-10) &amp; Joker. [\[Chaper 954 page 12\]](https://w11.mangafreak.net/Read1_One_Piece_954)

I assume Kaido is not part of the deck of cards therefore Ace is just Number 1.

if this came true as many expecting, Go D. Ussopp might be considered as Yonko Commander level by the Government (Since X Drake is present in Wano and can report it to Government) and it is comedic if he recognized by the government before going to Elbaf and later on to Raftel.",26,1583998947,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhcqa0/wano_arc_go_d_ussopp_vs/,OnePiece,1

fhbq28,Getty513,Story structure after Wano,"Many people, like myself, are curious as to what events might unfold after the Wano arc.

A lot of people are also concerned with the amount of content yet to be explored, in relation to the time left until the supposed ""end"" of One Piece. I'm of course referring to the ""5 years left"" thing that frankly I dont believe at all.

Parallels can be drawn from all the different arcs and sagas throughout One Piece. The most obvious parallel (in my opinion) connecting Paradise with the New World.

We can simplify the first half of the grand line, otherwise known as ""Paradise"" into 3 categories  starting with the 3 major Sagas, Alabasta, Skypia, Enies Lobby/Water 7, followed by a series of ""mini"" arcs such as Thriller bark, Sabaody, Amazon Lily, Impel Down, which finally lead into the war arc of Marineford.

The second half of the grand line, otherwise known as the ""New World"" can be similarly categorized. We have the 3 major sagas such as Dressrosa, Whole Cake Island, and Wano which we can assume is to be followed by smaller arc(s) pertaining to finding the One Piece and becoming Pirate King that ultimately lead into the concluding war of the series.

A major difference with the New World is that most if not all of the arcs are more closely related to each other. A specific example would be that early on in Punk Hazard we are introduced to Kinemon, who Carrie's a storyline throughout all the arcs leading up to Wano where we assume the conclusion will take place.

This is to be expected as the story of One Piece is nearing 75% completion if it has not already. The world is becoming more tense and consequences have become much more vital to story progression and character growth.

 So far this post may seem like common knowledge, or some sort of recap of the series however the main point I want to share specifically has to do with the ""mini"" arcs part of this parallel.

There are still quite a few islands we know about left to explore, and story arcs to tie up, such as Elbaf, Raftel, the One Piece, God Valley? And much more. A lot of content to cover with so little time. It's easy to think that these islands/stories will be rushed or passed over but I believe we should look at the near-end of the series differently. 

With the series nearing its end I believe the tension and excitement will only go up from here.  In my opinion Wano will be the last big arc (aside from the final war) and we will enter into a quick, but large series of small arcs that deal with all the remaining islands and loose ends, similar to the ""mini"" arcs of Paradise, but on a grander scale. This is to say they will not be poorly done purely because of their smaller size, especially in comparison to the much larger arcs. Yet they we be done so magnificently that it will be nonstop excitement.

We were excited during the time of those ""mini"" arcs in paradise to see how things would unfold so that we eventually entered the New World. Now we will be even more excited to see all of the things that will connect the story together and bring us into the final arc of One Piece.",4,1583992660,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fhbq28/story_structure_after_wano/,OnePiece,1

fh99l6,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 19: Buggy‚Äôs Past,"Yes, this is my first time reading One Piece

We start the chapter with Buggy falling over after being trucked by Luffy. You can tell Luffy is fucking pissed, but as much as I hate Buggy, he‚Äôs got a point about the whole ‚ÄúI can say whatever I want about Shanks.‚Äù But that doesn‚Äôt include destroying his hat, so yeah he‚Äôs still a bit of a dick. But the rest of this chapter does a good job of explaining why Buggy hates Shanks, even if it‚Äôs really his fault, but we‚Äôll get to that later. The Buggy crews faith in their captain was actually nice, you can tell they trust him a lot, and even though they‚Äôre all dickheads they aren‚Äôt the worst people in the world. That might just be my bias of liking Buggy so much though. We cut back to the villagers, who decide to go back on their own. Once again, it‚Äôs nice to see the village feel very alive, they aren‚Äôt robots that wait until Liffy shows up to do anything, they take action on their own, just like Chouchou and Boodle. It‚Äôs very good worldbuilding, and I enjoy Oda taking the time to put it in, even if some people find it boring. But all of that is just the precursor to Luffy and Shanks backstory. 

&amp;nbsp; 

We start by seeing Shanks and Buggy fighting over the North and South Poles. This doesn‚Äôt really mean anything, but we know that at this point in time, Buggy and Shanks were around the same level. It makes me wonder how Shanks got so much farther above him, but it might have something to do with Buggy relying too much on his Devil Fruit powers instead of training, which could be why he ended up being a small time pirate in East Blue. We see Buggy‚Äôs attitude clearly hasn‚Äôt changed too much over time, even in his youth he‚Äôs still talking about how treasure is all that matters. Buggy finds a big ol treasure map, with the treasure being in the ocean. This next moment is big, both for Buggy and Shanks as characters. Like Shanks said himself, Luffy is very similar to how he acted at his age. He has a big dream, instead of being pirate king it‚Äôs sailing around the world. It‚Äôs a goal that Buggy makes fun of, similar to how he attacked Luffy for saying he would be pirate king. The whole point is, they both have big dreams, and the will to fulfill those dreams. Buggy playing the realist in this situation makes sense, he‚Äôs clearly a guy who doesn‚Äôt have dreams as lofty as Luffy or Shanks. He just wants as much treasure as he can carry. It‚Äôs a really great scene, and a nice insight into Shanks way of thinking. Next we get to hear about the Devil Fruit the captain got, which doesn‚Äôt interest Buggy until he hears about its monetary value (big surprise there). Also I feel like Buggy is majorly underestimating the benefits of having a Devil Fruit here, but I guess the map he just got only works if you can swim so I‚Äôll give him a pass. 

&amp;nbsp;

We then get Buggy standing with the ‚ÄúDevil Fruit,‚Äù which he eats. Obviously it‚Äôs fake and he‚Äôs going to use the real one for money. Until Shanks jump scares him and he eats the fruit by accident. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs funnier, the fact that Buggy somehow thinks it‚Äôs Shanks fault that he‚Äôs an idiot, or the fact that all Luffy took away from the flashback was Shanks saving Buggy‚Äôs life. But yeah, while I can see why Buggy was pissed, I think he‚Äôs just trying not to blame himself, which makes sense seeing as vanity has been a running theme throughout the villains so far. Buggy finishes his flashback and charges at Luffy. So that was the chapter, and I liked it a lot much like the last two. I feel like this arcs climax has been quite satisfying so far, we get to see a lot more than in Romance Dawn. I‚Äôll go into more detail about how I feel about Buggy‚Äôs backstory later, but right now I do want to say that I think Buggy always had his priorities screwed up, and there wasn‚Äôt really a big moment where he became a dick, he just was one. That being said, I imagine that losing his life‚Äôs plan didn‚Äôt really help make him a better dude.",16,1583980313,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fh99l6/one_piece_journey_chapter_19_buggys_past/,OnePiece,1

fh8xhy,thedrifter129,Post- Wano One Piece,"So what do you think will be the story arcs post-Wano?  Will it just be the core SH crew or will they have guests traveling them again like Kinemon and Momonusuke did?  

&gt;!My take:  !&lt;

&gt;!After Wano we will get an update on what happened to Sabo during the Reverie, this will kick off a Revolutionaries mini arc wherein Luffy finally encounters Dragon. I think there has been enough build up towards that in the manga. !&lt;

&gt;!Of course the next big location the SH's have to go to is Elbaf. Not only is it Ussop's dream, I also believe the final Red Poneglyph is kept safe there. In Oden's flashback we saw that one of the Red Poneglyph was on Fishmen Island (and granted it might still be hidden there) and it's likely that Jinbei gave it to the Giants for protection after WB's death and FI came under BM's protection.  Oda's already hyped the Giants as having the world's greatest army during WCI.   Luffy reuniting with Shanks and Ussop meeting Yassop might happen on Elbaf as well.  Oda's already hyped up Shanks crew as having  high average bounty and his executives (Beckman, Lucky Roo, Yassop) as being notable as well, making them the closest parallel we have to the SH crew.  !&lt;",25,1583978871,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fh8xhy/post_wano_one_piece/,OnePiece,0

So, this isn‚Äôt really a theory based off of evidence, but one I‚Äôve thought of to explain some stuff I‚Äôve been thinking about. In chapter 1, Shanks talks about how the red hair pirates got the Gomu Gomu no mi from an enemy ship. An enemy that we know shanks fought in the past is Blackbeard. We also know that Blackbeard has been collecting devil fruits for some reason. I think that Blackbeard pirates were fighting with the Red Hair pirates over the Gomu Gomu no mi. At this point, Blackbeard would have the Yami Yami no mi, but no paramecia to accompany it, later becoming the Gura Gura no mi. Luffy has done some crazy stuff with the fruit, so I can see why Blackbeard would want it. He may have heard about this and wanted it because this was the fruit used by one of, if not the strongest pirates to ever live; Rocks D. Xebecc to conquer the seas.",8,1583976298,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fh8afm/blackbeard_rocks_shanks_and_the_gomu_gomu_no_mi/,OnePiece,1
fh8650,CrimsonKai,Wano arc seems to be heavily based on/ inspired by 47 Ronin.,"Wano arc so far seems to be influenced by 47 ronin.
You can see many elements of 47 ronin.
1)The direction of Kinemon and the remaining 9 scabbard's quest to take revenge on Kaido and Orochi  is very much similar to 47 Ronin taking revenge on Kira Yoshinaka for the death of Asano Naganori
2) Oden acting like a fool with an ulterior motive is very much in the line of  ≈åishi Kuranosuke Yoshio acting dishonourably to deceive Kira Yoshinaka. When Oden asks Toki is she will leave him, the scene depicts the life of ≈åishi Kuranosuke. His wife also know why ≈åishi was acting dishonourably so she never left him, this was seen with Oden and Toki as well.
3) The 9 scabbards along with the straw hats and heart pirates pretending to take up different occupations to gather more information on Orochi and Kaido and to deceive them is very much in line with the 47 ronin doing the same to Kira Yoshinaka
4)Momonoske was very much based upon Oishi Chinkara as Oishi Chinkara also worked with the 47 ronin and with his father Oishi Kuranosuke, the same can be seen with Momonoske working with the 9 scabbards to defeat Orochi and Kaido.
5) The stockpiling of the swords in one piece by the samurais is very much in line with the 47 Ronin doing the same to prepare for their attack against Kira.
and Finally, I feel Orochi's death will be very similar to how Kira was killed (begging on his feet and crying)
The arc is not a complete rip off of 47 ronin, you can see many elements has inspired Oda to base the Wano arc on the famous 47 Ronin. Wano is inspired by other historic events besides 47 Ronin.
The 47 Ronin story was/is an important event in Japan. They are still respected and worshipped even today and there have been countless plays Kabukis and different media based on this tale. So it is not surprising that this has left a huge impact on Oda. Overall it is still great to see how amazing Wano arc has been so far.
I noticed similarities between the two if I have missed anything let me know.",1,1583975827,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fh8650/wano_arc_seems_to_be_heavily_based_on_inspired_by/,OnePiece,1

\- managed to get some power and worked his way up in the flower capital

\- served under the man who is LITERALLY THE REASON why his goddamn face changed

\- became the HEAD of the Yakuza (which is huge btw!)

\- took care of Hiyori and made her the most beautiful women of wano, Komurasaki, who had enough success and fame to scam some rich old ugly men

\- all that money he and hiyori earned probably went to the poor, (if they didn't buy some fancy stuff for themselves lol) as he was wandering through villages at night

\- he helped a lot people who are still loyal to the kozuki plan survive. because of his high rank he was able to let them work under him as members of the yakuza or in the udon prison (which is why there were still so many loyal prisoners)

\- and FINALLY...he got blue hair which is way cooler thank ashura's hair.

Perhaps I'll sleep once I get it out. This is still a thought half-finished, and most of it is complete speculation, a lot of it is dubiously plausible, but just maybe, SOME of it is true. 

This theory almost completely explains the Birkans role in the world, the Ancient Kingdom, the origin and mechanics of the Devil Fruits, 'the will of the D, the Void Century, the Celestial Dragons, and how all of these tie together. It's a *THEORY*, again, so I don't wanna incite anger by saying it's correct, because it's not: by definition I'm admitting it's all ultimately conjecture, and it is.

Its morning, and I remembered half of the theory PROPERLY after sleeping on it, so here it is. I truly don't even think a TL;DR is possible, seeing as the sheer number of individual facts would make it half as long as the post, but I will try to do one (I tried, so long that if you even read it, you'd cbs re-reading it all again). I urge you, if you've made it even this far, to read just the first paragraph or two, and if you like it, just one more. And etc. etc.

Spoilers for chapter 967 at the latest*

- The Birka race of winged people that lived on the moon had mastered many very advanced forms of technology, but suffered a depletion of all their natural resources. They had SO FAR advanced their learning, they had some sort of a device or mechanism that was capable of harnessing/containing an element, Lineage Factor of a species, or even simple objects, foods, weapons, or FORCES OF NATURE, and COMBINING this with a Birkan, to make them composed of that element, hybridised with that Lineage Factor, or 'an X human', with the properties of that object/food, and all the powers that come with that.
- When the Birkans migrated to Earth, their flagship, containing all of their technology (including the above one), crashed upon landing, being impaled onto - *the 'Eve' tree*. This mechanism, device, or power, was destroyed in the process of the crash (as was most of the Birkans technology, and a lot of the Birkans, including ones imbued with many powers), and in the process, somehow melded or reacted with the Eve tree. In one unprecedented event, through the roots of the Eve tree, this flowing 'power of powers' touched the bodies of the power-imbued Birkans, *as their souls left their bodies*, and the 'power', along with the Birkans soul, were absorbed by the Eve tree, which could not contain so many Souls, and thus sprouted - *The Devil Fruits*
- Birkans are hydrophobic, their bodies completely adverse (either allergic to, or LETHAL) to the substance, as it does not exist on the Moon (perhaps they wore pseudo-spacesuits to protect from water on Earth, which the celestial dragons wear a version of). *This* is why there will never be a 'water' devil fruit: the 'power' couldn't, and didn't, ever exist on the Moon. *This* is why a Fruit user becomes immobilized and 'drained of strength' when submerged in water: the 'power' transferred by the Fruit also came with the properties of the Birkans soul, and thus become 'cursed to be rejected by the sea', they're simply 'hydrophobic' now. *This* is why a 'normal human' EXPLODES when they eat more than one Fruit: the average living being cannot hold more than one Birkan 'soul' at most, before their entire body is destroyed by the strain of it. 
- Thus, regarding the great mystery of Blackbeard possessing two Fruit Powers, supports the 'cerberus' theory over the 'Yami-Yami' theory, but does not necessarily conflict with the 'consuming heart/flesh' theory. I'm not going to claim a particular one here, as based on this theory so far, its truly possible for him to have either: (A) Eaten Whitebeards heart or flesh, thus transferring the power to him, using the huge black sheet as a cover to hide the secret from public knowledge. Lin-lin ate Caramel, achieving this effect by accident. In Dressrosa, Burgess was attempting to Kill Sabo, and transfer the power to a random fruit in the bag, because as soon as Sabo died, his soul would leave, and the 'power' would leave his body, but I am unsure why it goes to another random fruit, the only missing link. This is why Blackbeard jumps in JUST in time to get the killing blow on Whitebeard, there is only a narrow time frame. Or, (B), Blackbeard has some sort of Cerberus fruit, or an absorbed twin or twins, and he had fruits under the cover for the power to transfer in, and then ate them, and again used to the cover to hide the strategy/technique of this.
- This island was to be inhabited by the fallen Birkans, and eventually became - *The Ancient Kingdom* - a kingdom that surpassed all others in technological achievement and power. The Birkans, upon realizing that the planet was already inhabited by a sentient species, went about sharing its technology - and the newly existing fruits - throughout the world, as it is said that they have friends all over the globe, and their capacity to both make the poneglyphs, and spread them to every corner of the Earth, shows that even the Grand Line was nothing to their capabilities and knowledge
- Eventually, many Human Kingdoms formed, and Humans are a greedy species indeed. Twenty of these Kingdoms conspired together, envious of the greater technologies and powerful fruits that the Birkans coveted for themselves (they knew that they were too dangerous in the hands of war-mongering Humans), and overthrew the Ancient Kingdom, slaying every last Birkan in an unprecedented genocide, and seizing power over the globe for themselves. They could do this because they gathered and created weapons of incredible power - *The Ancient Weapons* - and used them against the Birkans. 
- Unwilling for History to be forgotten, one Birkan fought not against the Humans, but FOR ALL species to live together, in harmony. For this Birkan had a single dream, a single Will, which would never exist if the Humans succeeded in their quest for dominance over all other races: *to be the freest man in the world*. This Birkan, was *Joy. D. Boy.*
- Until now, Haki was not widely known about, as it did not exist in a great capacity. Many regions considered more primitive, which practiced ancient techniques and esoteric teachings, had forms of it; Wano has 'Ryo', a form of Advanced Haki; Eneru and his Priests knew of it as 'Mantra'; even the Six-Fold path used by CP9 is a form of primitive Haki, although it focuses more on physical techniques for improving the body. Haki is fuelled by *Will*, and as such, thrives in the heat of battle, where one's Will is pitted against anothers. Joy. D. Boy was the first to have such an intense Will, such a strong dream and desire, that he created and spread the Poneglyphs, to record the story he knew would be stricken by the soon-to-become *World Government*, and apologising for failing to fulfill his ambition in time (part of which was creating Noah for the Fishmen, to bring them to the surface and unite the peoples of Earth). He perished, although his Will, strong as it was, was to be passed on and inherited by many to come - *the Will of the D*
- As the *Void Century* came and went, the technologies and Devil Fruits of the extinct Birkans filtered out through the world. Some countries became leaps ahead, while others remained untouched. As the world broiled, History churned, and time rolled on its huge axis, the Will of the D continued. Inherited Will increased in the world, and the spiritual intensity increased, and the peaks of Haki strength worldwide have slowly increased over time. Soon, *Conquerors Haki* emerged: people with such intense Will, and such ruling disposition, that they could overwhelm the 'spirit' (haki) of those significantly weaker than them, rendering them unconscious. At the very limits of its power, those with the most advanced Conquerors Haki, and the strongest Wills, could even attract the aid of Fate itself, bending luck to their side, and easily earning the hearts of men.
- The World Government obviously has all the best Devil Fruits and technologies for themselves in this case. Dr Vegapunk - whether he be a Birkan, a human made immortal by the Ope-Ope no mi, or simply a human that made himself machine using the advanced birkan technology, becoming effectively an AI, and working for the WG to analyze the technology and retro-invent it all over again - was perhaps based with all this strong stuff at God Valley, which Xebec was the first ever to assault. Roger, knowing of the future he needs to preserve, goes to stop him taking over the world and becoming the strongest king to ever live. He and Garp won, Vegapunk lived, and God Valley was all but destroyed - before being not just destroyed, but *wiped from history* by the WG themselves.
- The *Celestial Dragons* are descendants of the first and only World King, who united the 20 Kingdoms centuries ago, and was the only Human to have Haki as strong, or stronger, than Joy. D. Boy - *Im-sama*. Im is either a Birkan, who are effectively ageless due to perfecting the technology ages ago, or has had the Ope-Ope no-mi Eternal Youth surgery performed on him, and this is why the World Government wants Law's fruit so badly. This is ALSO why Doflamingo *knows of the Eternal Youth surgery*, as WELL as why he knows what the 'treasure of Mariejois is. Im-sama, after being the creator of the Void Century, did not stop there in exercising his power. Throughout the last 8 centuries, he has 'erased from existence' *almost every member of the D. clan*, in an attempt to stop the dream of his only true opposer, Joy Boy, from coming true, and necessarily bringing his reign to an end. 
- This is why the Celestial Dragons are so untouchable, and why they are the MOST PROTECTED individuals on the planet, despite coming across as completely ignorant, cruel, spoiled, and child-like - *they are all the spoiled brats of the worlds most powerful Dad* - who has the strongest members of his private global police force - *the Marines* - HAVE TO exercise no restraint, and spare no resource, when punishing those who might even TOUCH some of the most painfully hated characters in the entire One Piece world. This is ALSO why the Celestial Dragons wear the psuedo-spacesuits; they are so *unbelievably upper-class and spoiled*, that they truly refuse to even breathe the same air as 'mere Earthlings'
- Roger, upon arriving at Laugh Tale, finally learned the full truth of the Void Century. Joy. D. Boy, the being with the strongest Will, Spirit and Haki to ever permeate history, had such advanced Observation Haki, that he glimpsed centuries into the future, and foretold of a time when his dream - which he saw was to be inherited and drift through history - would finally be fulfilled. He could even narrow it down to an exact date (within at least a year). Roger, the strongest Pirate the world had ever seen, holder of the 'D', and the man with unmatched Haki and Will, read ALL of this history and more, and saw with overwhelming amusement, that he was twenty years too early.

*and he laughed*

fh39yd,Ignaciodelsol,"With the recent mentions of the Moon, lets take a minute to discuss the moon in One Piece.","The moon is one of the biggest mysteries in the series. For one, it isn't entirely clear how many moons there are. We, as an audience, have never seen more than one moon, yet the globe in Ohara showed 6 moons, one of which had it's own moon (subsatellite). This is the only mention of any other moons we have seen, and all references to the moon have in reference to ""the moon"" as in singular. Either the globe in Ohara was for a different planet or something happened to all of the other moons/subsatelites. 

To tie it into the Kozuki claim, they have the crescent moon as their symbol and again refer to the moon as a singular entity. The minks also use the moon to go sulong, which would be considerably overpowered if there were another 5 moons at any given time.

The other issue is the previous inhabitants of the moon and the space pirates. We know all of the sky peoples initially came from the moon and left behind their technologically advanced city. We also know there are currently space pirates who come from god knows where. 

I invite you to list your own theories about why Oda would subtly  introduce such a major inconsistency, and what it could possible lead to. Here is mine:

All of the moons were inhabited, and at some point all but one of them crashed into the earth creating various islands and accounts for some of the unique races to OP. I imagine this would have happened well before the void century as the consequences of a moon crashing into the planet would be impossible to cover up and would have far greater consequences that would still be visible 800 years later.

TLDR: We know very little about the one piece moon and it seems to be growing in importance. I theorize there were more moons that crashed into the planet at some time.

Are there any other moon insights you have or theories you may have.",12,1583956734,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fh39yd/with_the_recent_mentions_of_the_moon_lets_take_a/,OnePiece,1

fh280j,sombrero69,Current cover story purpose,"Skip to the bolded text in the center to skip the fluff.

Bege and his family are currently occupying the cover story page for a long time and I've seen ppl around the sub get frustrated at the length and cuz nothing is happening but i feel that the cover story will play a big part in the next arc and I'm glad we got bege's bounty, waiting~~ for jinbe's updated one now.~~

Cover stories aren't just fillers but are good to know characters whereabouts and what happened to them but more importantly they show us characters that just we left on a recent arc that will reappear in some time and their small journey for many reasons, to ease in their reintroduction and not waste precious pages and panels showing how they got to a place. 

The latter example was helpful for coby and helmepos story, buggy solo journey, hatchan story (where caimie was first introduced), baroque works cover story, ace's search for blackbeard, jinbe and most recently caribou's cover story paid off.

If we didn't have these cover stories then these characters suddenly being somewhere would be kind of jarring, imagine coby suddenly coming with luffy's grandpa or hatchan suddenly being in the last island in paradise when he was last seen in east blue or wapol as a king again in the reverie when he was sent flying by luffy.

**Back to the current cover story**

After bege left WCI chiffon free from big mom decided to find lola and they found traces of her being in dressorsa, reminder that lola was in water 7 in an earlier cover page series. 

Lola most likely hasn't met a husband yet i doubt oda would let her do that off screen, lola is now in the NW not lost in the florian triangle where even big mom's information network couldn't find her and another island in the NW is elbaf, let's say her ex fiance loki finds out and kidnaps her or lola decides to go to elbaf to marry the man who loves her by her own terms not forced by her mother.

Tbh i don't have a solid theory to what gets here there but i feel she's gonna go there bcz Lola's ties to the story were that she's the daughter of big mom and on WCI we find out that the prince of giants wants to wed her and now so close to elbaf bege gets a cover story where he looks for her, no way it's just for a simple family reunion, this is how bege gets relevant again and gets back in the story. Just like jinbe leaving FI and his cover story leading up to WCI this cover story will follow suit

The strawhats already have many allies in elbaf from dorry and broggy to oimo and kashi, the giant from the auction house and now hajrudin and his crew. The elbaf giants may also respect luffy more for antagonizing big mom and maybe possibly defeating her in wano (i hope big mom gets her resolution in wano but that's a story for another day)

Lola could open up the door for SH's ally in the royal family up in the giant bean stalk. Lola going to elbaf would tie up the plot points that oda introduced and knowing oda he didn't introduce them aimlessly.

fgz8ya,v_a_ibhav,Act 3 = Infinity War and Act 4 = Endgame,"I have seen a plethora of theories regarding the traitor or discussion threads of who will fight who during the war, but I haven't seen anyone talk about whether the Fire Festival will be the final battle of Wano or not.

*There will be spoilers for Anime onlys and those who haven't watched Infinity War and Endgame so read at your own risk.*

I recently watched Mr Morj's videos of why the Fire Festival will end in failure and why Wano will be 200+ chapters long and would recommend watching them after reading this post. So after watching those videos, I agree with what he said and I would like to expand upon that.

In all the big One Piece arcs there is always a plan the Strawhats have and it always go haywire due to one reason or another. After that, there is always a low point in the story and our protagonists then make a comeback and defeat the big bad of the arc. This is the basic formula of almost all the big One Piece arcs.

That's why, I think the Strawhats will fail during the Fire Festival which will mark the end of Act 3. The Wano arc is following the Kabuki play structure and a Kabuki play has 5 acts in which, the 3rd act is the longest one and always ends with a dramatic low point. Similar to how at the end of Infinity War, Thanos snapped and we all know what happened after that. The Strawhats will fail, most likely their biggest defeat in the whole series. Someone significant could very well die and I would be fine with that.

The Strawhats will be really sad after the defeat and possibly someone's death which will really hit their morale since Luffy said after Marineford  that he won't let any of his nakama to die. 

In Act 4 of a Kabuki play, the protagonists defeat the big bad after regrouping and getting over their melancholy blues.  Sounds familiar? That's what happens in almost all One Piece arcs and also happened in Endgame. I can see the Strawhats trying to get over their horrible defeat together as a crew and this would be a nice way to give the Strawhats time together, that people have been asking ever since Fishman Island. This would be the moment similar to how the Avengers were after the snap. They would be sad and the weight over their shoulders would be way more compared to what it is right now.

Here ends my theory. Now, after this is my headcanon so read at your own risk!!

First of all, I can see Luffy trying to go for Kaido during the Fire Festival and getting some solid hits at him and makeing him bleed but Kaido destroys him nonetheless but this time it takes more than one shot. Then, I can see Zoro and Sanji trying to rescue Luffy and I can see Zoro's Shandai, haki infused, breaking by taking a single hit from Kaido. What if his Wado also breaks during the process. THE FEELS WILL BE TOO MUCH TO HANDLE!!! 

Then when they attack Kaido again after training for a while, I can see Zoro wielding Nidai and Shisui (if Wado breaks, which is HIGHLY unlikely) and defeating King in 1 on 1. I can see a Strawhats assemble scene similar to Endgame with all the STRAWHATS, GRAND FLEET, SCABBARDS, ALL THE SUPERNOVAS AND LITERALLY ANYONE SIGNIFICANT. I can see Luffy leading them from the front and marching toward Kaido and Big Mom with all that firepower.

One more reason I think the Fire Festival will end in failure is because the hype in this arc is nowhere close in making Marineford look cute. I am not denying I am not super hyped, but let's be honest, its just not enough to make something like Marineford look cute at all!! And it will also make Luffy defeating Kaido seem plausible. I can also see Law dying during the final fight.

fgz295,TheEvman,Romance in One Piece,"This isn't me trying to ship characters coz I don't really care about that and it is not the least bit important to me or Oda in terms of One Piece as a whole. However, do you think Oda will ever form any sort of romantic relationships later down the line in the story.

I don't think there will be unless we get a timeskip at the end of the story like 10-20 years in the future where you might see some relationships. This isn't asking who you would like to see together, I'm asking if you think realistically Oda will write any characters together.

For starters, I'm fairly sure that none of the SHs will be romantically involved with each other as that would just feel weird and ruin the whole ""family"" dynamic. And quite honestly, I don't see Oda taking too much time to explore romance in the story as for most fans (including me) that is not a priority. But if he were, the only ones that I can realistically see potentially happening are (I don't think any of them will happen though):

* Luffy and Hancock
* Zoro and Tashigi
* Zoro and Hiyori
* Sanji and Pudding
* Robin and Law

I know a lot of people think Nami and Luffy or Nami and Sanji, but then again, I don't think the SHs will become romantically involved among themselves. Once again, I don't really care if any of these end up happening or not, but I would like to hear what people believe the chances of Oda actually implementing any relationships at the end of the series are.",46,1583941126,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgz295/romance_in_one_piece/,OnePiece,1

fgyxpp,KingOfMustache,Is there anyone who you thought would‚Äôve/should‚Äôve join the Straw Hats but didn‚Äôt? (Excluding Vivi),"I plan on eventually doing a series on different characters in the series and whether they should‚Äôve joined the crew, I know which characters I‚Äôd like to cover but I want to get a feel for how the community sees it since I only got into One Piece in the last year or so. Plus, it‚Äôs just a fun what if scenario. We‚Äôre excluding Vivi just because she‚Äôs the obvious choice. I‚Äôll also say that I realize this could be a touchy subject, so I‚Äôll ask everyone to stay positive, taste is subjective, and everyone is entitled to their opinions. Wano discussion is allowed, but I‚Äôd like to mainly focus on characters from previous arcs, and I would remind everyone to use spoiler tags if necessary.

While there aren‚Äôt many characters that I‚Äôd say ‚Äúshould‚Äôve‚Äù joined, I still personally believe that Camie and Hachan should‚Äôve joined after Fishman Island, though I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm strongly biased seeing as how the two are among my favorite characters. 
Camie would join as a non-combatant, and her official role on the crew would be the tailor; she would act as an in-universe explanation for the Straw Hats‚Äô ever-expanding wardrobe beyond just shopping. As a mermaid, the fastest race in the water, she would be a great lifeguard for the Devil Fruit eaters. I would suggest that she could act as a messenger, especially in Wano, a country connected by rivers, but given her luck she would probably just end up in the belly of a sea king or a fisherman‚Äôs net. Franky could rig up something for manuvering on land, perhaps even finding a way to take the Eve bubbles outside of their climate.
Hachi would be a combatant mainly, though a swordsman like Zoro, he carries his own unique sword style, which he combines with his ink (octopus ink is poisonous by the way) to make himself into a more technical fighter. You could give him an official role, but it would likely be something minor like cabinboy or resident takoyaki chef. In most cases he would probably just act as Camie‚Äôs bodyguard. Not to mention the fact that he is, currently, the strongest swordsman on fishman island
Having them both join would be a great way to push the theme of racial unity, and could act as a vehicle for character development from Nami given her history with Hachi. It could also act as a way to introduce a dash of romance into the series without any unnecessary will-they-won‚Äôt-they drama. Just a cute relationship in the background. The only really good argument  I can see against it is that Hachi‚Äôs dream is to open a takoyaki shop, which he‚Äôs already done, but you could write around this with higher loyalties or responsibilities. Like maybe Camie decides to join the Straw Hats for one reason or another and Hachi joins so that he can protect her. Anyway there are a million ways of doing it so there isn‚Äôt any need to split hairs.",89,1583940655,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgyxpp/is_there_anyone_who_you_thought_wouldveshouldve/,OnePiece,1
fgyuga,dannydankwood,"The One Piece ""Theory of Everything""","I'm writing this at 2AM because I can't sleep, and this entire epiphany came to me on the edge of dream. Perhaps I'll sleep once I get it out. This is still a thought half-finished, and most of it is complete speculation, a lot of it is dubiously plausible, but just maybe, SOME of it is true. I will make a TL;DR in the morning. 

Spoilers for chapter 967 at the latest*

- The Birka race of winged people that lived on the moon had mastered many very advanced forms of technology, but suffered a depletion of all their natural resources. They had SO FAR advanced their learning, they had some sort of a device or mechanism that was capable of harnessing/containing an element, Lineage Factor of a species, or even simple objects, foods, weapons, or FORCES OF NATURE, and COMBINING this with a Birkan, to make them composed of that element, hybridised with that Lineage Factor, or 'an X human', with the properties of that object/food, and all the powers that come with that.
- When the Birkans migrated to Earth, their flagship, containing all of their technology (including the above one), crashed upon landing, being impaled onto - *the 'Eve' tree*. This mechanism, device, or power, was imbued into the Eve tree, through whose roots was absorbed all the elements, species, and technologies/items/tools/weapons/foods of the humans and Birkans, which were transferred into - *the Devil Fruits* - which sprouted all over the tree
- This island was to be inhabited by the fallen Birkans, and eventually became - *The Ancient Kingdom* - a kingdom that surpassed all others in technological achievement and power. The Birkans, upon realizing that the planet was already inhabited by a sentient species, went about sharing its technology - and the newly existing fruits - throughout the world, as it is said that they have friends all over the globe, and their capacity to both make the poneglyphs, and spread them to every corner of the Earth, shows that even the Grand Line was nothing to their capabilities and knowledge
- Eventually, many Human Kingdoms formed, and Humans are a greedy species indeed. Twenty of these Kingdoms conspired together, envious of the greater technologies and powerful fruits that the Birkans coveted for themselves (they knew that they were too dangerous in the hands of war-mongering Humans), and overthrew the Ancient Kingdom, slaying every last Birkan in an unprecedented genocide, and seizing power over the globe for themselves. They could do this because they gathered and created weapons of incredible power - *The Ancient Weapons* - and used them against the Birkans. 
- Unwilling for History to be forgotten, one Birkan fought not against the Humans, but FOR ALL species to live together, in harmony. For this Birkan had a single dream, a single Will, which would never exist if the Humans succeeded in their quest for dominance over all other races: *to be the freest man in the world*. This Birkan, was *Joy. D. Boy.*
- Until now, Haki was not widely known about, as it did not exist in a great capacity. Many regions considered more primitive, which practiced ancient techniques and esoteric teachings, had forms of it; Wano has 'Ryo', a form of Advanced Haki; Eneru and his Priests knew of it as 'Mantra'; even the Six-Fold path used by CP9 is a form of primitive Haki, although it focuses more on physical techniques for improving the body. Haki is fuelled by *Will*, and as such, thrives in the heat of battle, where one's Will is pitted against anothers. Joy. D. Boy was the first to have such an intense Will, such a strong dream and desire, that he created and spread the Poneglyphs, to record the story he knew would be stricken by the soon-to-become *World Government*, and apologising for failing to fulfill his ambition in time (part of which was creating Noah for the Fishmen, to bring them to the surface and unite the peoples of Earth). He perished, although his Will, strong as it was, was to be passed on and inherited by many to come - *the Will of the D*
- As the *Void Century* came and went, the technologies and Devil Fruits of the extinct Birkans filtered out through the world. Some countries became leaps ahead, while others remained untouched. As the world broiled, History churned, and time rolled on its huge axis, the Will of the D continued. Inherited Will increased in the world, and the spiritual intensity increased, and the peaks of Haki strength worldwide have slowly increased over time. Soon, *Conquerors Haki* emerged: people with such intense Will, and such ruling disposition, that they could overwhelm the 'spirit' (haki) of those significantly weaker than them, rendering them unconscious. At the very limits of its power, those with the most advanced Conquerors Haki, and the strongest Wills, could even attract the aid of Fate itself, bending luck to their side, and easily earning the hearts of men.
- Roger, upon arriving at Laugh Tale, finally learned the full truth of the Void Century. Joy. D. Boy, the being with the strongest Will, Spirit and Haki to ever permeate history, had such advanced Observation Haki, that he glimpsed centuries into the future, and foretold of a time when his dream - which he saw was to be inherited and drift through history - would finally be fulfilled. He could even narrow it down to an exact date (within at least a year). Roger, the strongest Pirate the world had ever seen, holder of the 'D', and the man with unmatched Haki and Will, read ALL of this history and more, and saw with overwhelming amusement, that he was twenty years too early.

fgyakt,EmmaNielsen,What One Piece is actually about.,"I'm at a point where I am working on my Master Thesis and I just need something familiar to run next to my work, something I know in and out so that I don't need to pay 100% attention and can smoothly work on my thesis. 

Now with my already known knowledge of Rogers demise, and how he had to sacrifice himself for the pirate era to begin, I realized one thing. 

I feel like Roger always wanted to take down the worlds corruption / government with the lines ""Let's turn the world upside down""  as in, he wanted to re-create the world as we know it.

He got sick, and couldn't find a cure, so the only thing left was to ignite a soul into new set of pirates that would follow his steps. There Luffy comes, care free and all he wants is to sail free as in Freedom. Which means Government doesn't exist.  Or worst case re-shaped from corruption.

Now Luffy's Crew entry to the grand line, the doctor says ""Is he the guy we have been waiting for all this time Roger?"" before the episode comes to an end. As in, is he the one who will pick up where Roger left and face the government. 

As someone who believes in Tashigi x Zoro  I've to believe that Smoker will be the Brave Marine, who can't stand the Marines at the end and won't bow for corruption and even support Luffy at the end, where even Tashigi starts to believe that they are doing the right thing. So that Zoro x Tashigi is a possibility. 

But yes  All in all, my belief of one piece is Luffy vs WG.  In the end, they will find One Piece which is a legendary Island of beauty.  Paradise on Earth.  Sanji finds All Blue. 

I also have a feeling that entire Grand Line will be demolished somehow, so that the 4 seas can connect. by demolished i'm talking about the outer-ring",11,1583938156,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgyakt/what_one_piece_is_actually_about/,OnePiece,1

fgy35k,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 18: Luffy vs Buggy The Clown Pirate,"The chapter starts out with pretty much everyone out of commission, except for Luffy and Buggy. Buggy trying to taunt Luffy with the information and him not understanding it at all was funny, Buggy and Luffy have had really good chemistry. So now the fight starts with Buggy and Luffy using their Devil Fruit abilities to their fullest. The choreography in this fight is great because of it, both of the fighters have really unique abilities, and the way those abilities are integrated into the fight is great. Buggy‚Äôs torso popping off to rush at Luffy, and then Luffy using his arms like web shooters from Spider-Man to dodge is really great stuff. Gomu Gomu no scythe and Buggy‚Äôs head flying off to dodge it was really good too, and I think it shows that for all of his bullshitting, Buggy can hold his own in a fight. The audience reactions are great too, it shows that a battle between two Devil Fruit users is simply on another level. Buggy‚Äôs separation on his arm is awesome stuff as well, and then he accidentally scuffs Luffys hat. This is a great lead into the central theme of personal treasure, and how Buggy metaphorically tries to destroy it by impaling the hat with his blades. We now see Luffy pissed for the second time.

&amp;nbsp;

So then we get more on Shanks and Buggy. They were part of the same crew at one point, which answers some questions but raises others. Who‚Äôs crew were they on, and why did they end up splitting? How did they end up with such wildly different personalities? But before any of that, we see Luffy fucking truck Buggy as he tries to do the Bara Bara Escape, with some more great Buggy faces. So that was the chapter, this review was shorter because obviously it was mostly action. I will say like I did at the start of the chapter that I‚Äôm a big fan of Devil Fruits, and the crazy powers they give to people. It doesn‚Äôt seem like you need one to be successful though, as Shanks doesn‚Äôt have one and we probably won‚Äôt see him for a while, because I doubt Luffy is giving the hat back that quickly in the story.

fgxpe0,DustyGaming370,Discussion Why can't Zoro be stronger than Luffy?,"Something that keeps coming to mind whenever I think of the strength between Luffy and Zoro is that there is no reason why Zoro can't be stronger. A lot of people assume that because he follows Luffy he must be weaker but Luffy never beat him in a fight. Zoro didn't choose to follow Luffy because of his strength. He chose to follow him purely because he respected him and believed he would reach his own goal while on Luffy's path. 

But one thing that really comes to mind is when they first ran into Kuma. Kuma tested Zoro by removing all of the damage Luffy had taken and placed it into Zoro. Not only had Zoro dealt with his own fights, but he now had to take all the damage that was enough to make Luffy go unconscious. And when everyone woke up, Zoro was still standing and conscious. In addition to this, Zoro is only strawhat that has ever actually trained in his free time. He practically lives in the gym just training.

So what if the reason Zoro hasn't been in spotlight post time skip is because he's already at a level that Luffy is working towards? Oda just isn't ready to show that. So rather than showing him struggle for some reason, he just hasn't given him a reason to flex.",43,1583935691,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgxpe0/discussion_why_cant_zoro_be_stronger_than_luffy/,OnePiece,1

I am thinking about why literally every person so far pretty much reinvented themself or already was some sort of a significant person when he/she ate a Devil Fruit. Is there like.. the most generic person ever, John Doe, working 9 to 5 in an office job somewhere and somehow through some weird event he ate the Nagi Nagi no Mi (calm calm fruit) or something similarly unexciting like the Bata Bata no Mi (butter fruit).. and his life probably would not change much. Do you think there are lots of DF powers out there in the hands of ""boring"" people, maybe even unknowingly? I just found the idea funny and ironic. This guy, fed up with his exhausting and tiring job comes across a DF, he is excited, takes a bite and then... just the calm calm fruit.

We have seen glimpses of stuff here and there, like the parting of Reyleigh and Gol D Roger, WB and GR meet, the whole GR and portgas D rouge scene, and the actual execution scene where all the major players of the game were present and witnessed it. I feel there has to be some more layers to this whole story given how lively and greater then life character Gol D Roger is or was. Also need more detailed crew interaction.

fgv89s,HighLaugh,He need sum milk.,"This is a serious post.


So, amongst all the unsolved mysteries of this intricate and beautiful shonen manga by the legendary Eiichiro Oda, the one mystery that stands out the most today for me is Marshall D. Teach aka Blackbeard's missing teeth. Just who in the world gave this man less teeth to worry about?


I have two culprits so far, the first, Shanks.
It has been noted throughout the manga that both these guys have been going at it, judging from the Oden flashback chs, more than once. We all know BB gave Shanks his scar, and since Shanks isn't one to boast about feats, the assumption can be made that Shanks may have also returned the favour by giving Teach his missing teeth. BUT, as we also know, Shanks is a sword user! He could've socked him for all I know, but tbh, it just doesn't make sense to me for a swordsman to disregard his weapon of choice to use his fist in the heat of battle. Which leads me to the next culprit...


Buggy D. Go-, I mean Buggy.
An excerpt from the Wikia, Buggy's abilities: ""The Bara Bara no Mi is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to be immune to slashing attacks and to be able to split their own body apart into pieces and control the said pieces however they wish, mostly by levitating them away from the user's main body, making the user a Splitting Human („Éê„É©„Éê„É©‰∫∫Èñì, Barabara Ningen?)"".
It's unknown whether or not of buggy was around when shanks received his scar, there was a revised anime ep showing shanks and buggy parting ways in Rouge town(I think), but I don't know if it's canon or not.

My theory on how Buggy could be responsible is, as soon as Teach struck Shanks, Buggy pulled a Shoot(hunterxhunter), he probably hid one of his hands, as soon as Teach let his gaurd down then,  BOOM! Colgate smile for life.

Prediction: I really want Buggy D Goat to be the one who gave Teach his beautiful smile we all know and love.

fguua4,Carpax,MANGA SPOILERS - Turning the World Upside Down.,"Libraryofohara recently came out with his [analysis](https://thelibraryofohara.com/2020/03/10/chapter-secrets-chapter-973-in-depth-analysis/) of the most recent chapter in One Piece, Chapter 973. In this, he refers to different parallels made throughout One Piece that has relevance to the current arc of Wano and the most recent flashback of Oden's and the 9 Scabbard's lives.

One thing that stood out to me and many others, was both Oden and Whitebeard in parallel 16 curious way of referencing to the One Piece and what will happen when it is found. They say the ""World will be turned upside down"". And they are not alone about that. Libraryofohara also adresses that Roger said that to Rayleigh, when they first met for their adventures.  He tells Rayleigh the two of them meeting must be fate and asks if he'd like to come along and ""turn the world upside down"" with him.

  
I wonder if ""Turning the world upside down"" might be literal. I think it could refer to Luffy and the Straw Hats destroying the Red Line, sinking it and Mariejois to the bottom of the ocean instead of the   
standing on the top, thus turning the established order and the WORLD Government upside down, resulting in freeing the rest of the world from its despair of 800 years of oppression.

There are many theories going around that either one of, if not all three, of the Ancient Weapons, will sink the red line, thus creating the All Blue. I wonder if the One Piece is the final key for taking down this hurdle.

&amp;#x200B;

Not the most in-depth of theories but here it is I guess.

fgugy0,Scopper_Sanji,What was the point of WCI for Sanji? (Spoilers),"So how exactly did Sanji's character develop in WCI? People call this a character arc, but there is literally no development of Sanji's character. All the things of Sanji that were displayed were already known to us at the start of the series when he is introduced. 

We know that he is unparalleled when it comes to cooking, we know already that he would sacrifice his life for his crewmates, and we already knew that he would feed anyone if they were hungry. We also know that Sanji will not hold woman's sins against them already (Sanji and Viola and Sanji and Robin). So what exactly was newly developed in Sanji's character?

I for one was left very unsatisfied with the ending. Judge still saw him as a failure and by wearing the RS, Sanji is just reinforcing that Judge was right. Don't get me wrong I love the aesthetics of the RS and think it makes Sanji look very cool, but I hate how it is portrayed. 

I personally think that a fight at the end of the arc was needed and a perfect opportunity would have been at the end where Judge is facing off against Snack. Judge is getting pummeled and Sanji steps in, saves his father and shows his strength given to him by his real father, Zeff, proving Judge's view of Zeff being an inferior figure to be wrong. They need not have had an all-out fight, but Sanji could have clashed with Snack, showing Judge that when it comes to combat, Zeff was his true mentor. Zeff gave Sanji, not only his code and his skill in cooking but also trained him to be a fighter with his own style. The raid suit essentially denies Zeff's legacy, because it makes Zeff inferior to Judge in terms of how they have shaped Sanji's combat skills. 

I personally think that Oda ran out of ideas for Sanji's fighting style and just winged it because the RS looked cool. It seems really, really out of place to have Sanji have a technological suit out of nowwhere. It's not like Franky who has a continual theme of technology or even Usopp. Sanji's suit and tie, are an integral part of his character. People will say that it doesn't affect his style and it is just a weapon no different to Zoro gaining a new sword or Luffy's DF. But Zoro has been honing his swordsmanship ever since his introduction and Luffy's DF is part of him, the Raid Suit is an extra device to power up Sanji that just doesn't sit right and comes out of left-field.

fgtyjz,ImmaIvanoM,Finally this Traitor business makes sense,"Hiyori gave Kyoshiro the alliance paper when she got ""cut down"" at the banquet. The next day the samurai were being rounded up in the capital.

Kyoshiro did this in order to use Orochi's army to find and round up all the rebels as quick as possible instead of relying on Usopp and company slowly collecting rebel members which wasnt guaranteed to collect everyone in time.

It's shown that Orochi doesn't actually know that the people with the tattoo are rebels meaning the Traitor has only been feeding partial information to Orochi which is only explainable if the traitor is actually manipulating Orochi as well.

Orochi comes up with the plan to blow up all the bridges except those of the flower capital. This plan was suggested by Kyoshiro so that when the time comes, he can free the prisoners in the capital and lead them to the port.

Kyoshiro learned about the change in the port because he's the one who came up with it. He met with Yasuie when he was arrested and they devised the new plan to change ports and Yasuie pretended to be the Witching hour boy.

Kyoshiro told Orochi the whereabouts of Hiyori so that Orochi would send forces to Capture her and these forces would get ambushed and destroyed. Kyoshiro knows where Hiyori is because the two are in cahoots as the traitor.

That's the general behaviour of Kyoshiro and the traitor and Hiyori explained.

The few missing things are Kyoshiro/Hiyori/the traitor told Orochi the whereabouts of the Sunny and fact the Udon prison was taken over. The only explanation is that Kyoshiro hates outsiders. He knows an outsider took over udon so he snitches on them so that Kaido's forces would go and kill the outsider and the prisoners would just be put back to work. Then he told Orochi about the Sunny and we see Beast pirates blowing it up. What's interesting is that Hiyori seems to like Zoro a bit so there might be conflict with Kyoshiro about how to deal with the outsiders.

This explains why Kyoshiro stopped Zoro from killing Orochi, because he hates outsiders that much.

TL; DR
Therefore technically, there is no traitor, just two people with their own Agenda and plan to deal with Orochi. (Even in the flashback there was no traitor.

fgsw5a,gyuukarubi5,The Secrets of Stampede: War Against the Pirate King's Rival and the Mystery of One Piece (manga spoilers),"***One Piece: Stampede.***

The 20th anniversary film. One that Oda himself didn't want Toei making until now.

I think that many tend to overlook this film as mere popcorn fare because it isn't considered canon. However, Oda has chosen to reveal some of the deepest mysteries of the series in this film. Many feel that meant ""Laugh Tale,"" but I actually think there's more to it than that.

Y'see, a lot of the film *doesn't actually make sense.* Specifically, character motivations and actions. Now that it's streaming legally in the US, I've rewatched it and came out with more insights and questions than the first time I saw it.

So I figured I'd recount these. Lots of it is healthy speculation, but I think it's worth watching and asking yourself the same questions. I love rebuttals too, so please chime in with any other ideas. 

Moreover, this has been done from the perspective of someone up to date in the manga. Spoilers follow.

**Regarding Bullet**

* The film opens with Blackbeard gathering his crew in a bloody prison riot. This scene is much darker than we initially were led to believe in both the anime and the manga. Blackbeard leaves Bullet. Is it out of fear? Or because of competing ideologies?
* Don't underestimate the significance of Bullet. Oda created him. That means he *chose* to include ***one of the crewmates of the Pirate King*** in this film. Think about how much significance Oden and Rayleigh had. Don't believe me? Think about this:
   * Bullet is said to be as strong as Rayleigh, making him a major player on Roger's crew.
   * He was also said to be Roger's rival and adversary. I sort-of view him as Roger's Katakuri, in some ways.
   * Bullet is called the ""Demon Heir,"" clearly in reference to Roger being a demon. They call him ""the heir to Roger's strength.""
   * Bullet is a master of Devil Fruit awakening (confirmed in this film to be an extension of paramecia abilities to the outside world) AND has the Ambition of Conquerors.
   * Bullet's CoC manifests in a blue wave. Bullet's Haki literally turns his skin blue in his demonic form, as he infuses it in his body. I wonder if anyone with CoC Haki can do this (including Roger), since the ability is not explained. He also uses it in Ultimate Faust.
      * Luffy's CoC Haki manifests in a red wave. King King King Kong Gun seems to be infused with CoC Haki.
   * Bullet's ideology seems to be very similar to Rocks' ‚Äî he's got some great quotes:
      * ""The road to the top is paved in blood.""
      * ""The seas are a battlefield!""
      * ""Power's the only thing that matters in this world!""
   * Bullet's goal is to be ""the strongest."" Whatever was on Laugh Tale would *make* him that, which is why the Marines, the World Government, and Crocodile wanted it so badly. So One Piece confers power.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Observations + Questions**

* When the Eternal Pose to Laugh Tale is revealed, Morgan says ""An Eternal Pose to Laugh Tale? A scoop like this could flip the world upside down!""
   * Roger, Whitebeard, and Toki have all said this exact same phrase about One Piece. I get the feeling that the power on Laugh Tale may literally flip the world over in some manner.
   * Festa's goal: ""My festival will plunge the world into a state of madness! We'll call it a stampede!""
      * What did the title of the film refer to? The stampede of characters? I think of animals... specifically, giant animals. And the only animals that I can think of stampeding in their world...would be the giant elephants. This may be a major hint.
   * Roger seems to have a penchant for hiding hidden treasure in the sky.
* Law *must* be a marine. Buggy (+200 pirates) were running security at the festival and solely went after him... why Law specifically? ***Because Marines aren't allowed.***
   * Bullet wasn't the one who injured Law at the beginning of the film, as he was surprised to learn that fact from Crocodile later in the film. Who did it, then?
* When the knock-up stream explodes and the Supernovas fall to the island below, Urouge is shown being revived by his crew. He definitely has a devil fruit.
   * He seemingly can increase his size and strength based on the damage he takes. Hence, ""Karmic Retribution.""
* I like how Bonney throws eggs at Bullet and ages them into doves. I would imagine that she may be able to do this with all food, making her ability more powerful than I imagined.
* Kid is definitely Luffy's foil, as both become human weapons. Luffy is a gun, Kid combines into other weapons.
* The Marines, Garp included, have shed a lot of blood under the ideology ""stamp out evil by any means necessary."" They're just as guilty in their crusade for righteousness. What drives them? What did the world look like in its most chaotic state?
* Robin is extremely suspect as a character. Her actions don't make *any* sense in the film and come across as self-serving. Why was she looking for those documents? How did they help anyone?
   * Robin seemed to intuitively understand Bullet's goal without even probing.
   * Why was Robin called ""Miss All Sunday""? Is this some sort of code by Oda, similar to Sanji's ""Mr. Prince""? All Sun day? Think about how that ties into ""romance dawn"" and Toki's prophecy.
* Bullet says to Luffy ""You're using your devil fruit with that much Haki? You're going to burn out in no time at all!""
   * Luffy shortened his life with Second Gear, but we haven't even started to think about how Third and Fourth Gear have compounded that effect.
   * I think the burnout here is literal too. Luffy will become ""Fire Luffy.""
   * Oda reveals that fire moves are Haki. Sanji's Diable Jambe is confirmed to be Haki in his fight against Smoker, Sabo uses Ryuo against Bullet, and now this.

fgsoe0,delicateenergy,Zoro Advance Armament,"Zoro has advance armament haki. Why are people even questioning this? Here is the proof:

Emission. Emission is an advance form Busoshoku. Zoro cuts monet's cheek with an emitted slash. Logias can only be hit by Haki or their direct weakness(Crocoboy and water). I see people using Rankakyu as an argument, when has a Rankakyu ever hit a logia? 

Hyogoro's explanation. Luffy explains to Hyogoro what he is trying to do, emit his haki. Hyo isn't familiar with the term ""haki"", but is familiar with the basic outline of what Luffy is trying to do. Hyogoro then goes on to explain the technique then literally showcases it. How do people misinterpret this? I am very concerned for those of you who thinks he is explaining basic busoshoku. Hyogoro can literally see that Luffy knows the basic hardening technique, why the hell would he be explaining that to Luffy who knows it, he is literally explaining the advance technique. First he explains it, then literally showcases it for Luffy.

I won't even talk about how Zoro can control his haki to the point where it is released and he can pull it back in(Enma)

How do you guys even read the manga? 

Yes, I know Luffy has an even more advanced busoshoku, but I am talking about Zoro.",20,1583907361,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgsoe0/zoro_advance_armament/,OnePiece,1
fgsk58,PernidaParknjas,Will it happen?,"Will the strawhats actually overcome a Yonko? Do you think it will happen, and if so do you think it will make sense? Luffy and Zoro got big buffs in Ryou and Enma respectively, but will it be enough? The supernovas are there too and are all probably looking to make a name for themselves or get revenge. 

I‚Äôm gonna do my best to line up the factors in play.
We know the Beast Pirates are mostly fodder up through the headliners, with their abilities being straight Garbo. Kyoshiro is probably going to turn his yakuza against Orochi and Kaido, bringing up the forces of the rebellion to over 4,000 men total. This is including the powerful scabbards, ninja, and samurai of wano who joined the cause. That being said, you‚Äôve still got absolutely monstrous forces going for the Beast Pirates.
Jack, King, and Queen are all incredibly strong, with Jack measuring up to one of the strongest scabbards in Ashura Doji. It‚Äôs unknown how strong King and Queen are, since their only interactions have been with the lead balloon herself, but they‚Äôre definitely at least on par with Jack. Then there‚Äôs the giant spooky ghost bois the Numbers, who are apparently threatening enough to be constantly run from at all costs (awakened zoans?). Kaido is Kaido. Then there‚Äôs the real wild card, the alliance with Big Bertha. I do not know if DenjiKyoshiro knows of her presence, and that could be a huge confounding factor. It‚Äôs a big maybe if the strawhats and gang can best one yonko, but two? That‚Äôs just not happening.

fgsc7v,AHickey1995,Re-writing One Piece if Luffy wasn‚Äôt born.,"So in another thread someone detailed what would have happened to a variety of characters if Luffy didn‚Äôt exist. It compelled me so much that I ended up making a huge wall of text explaining the implications of that especially from a new world perspective. Since I‚Äôm weird and can‚Äôt sleep I decided to expand on this and rewrite the story if Luffy had never been born starting from the beginning. This is mostly based on memory and I‚Äôm only gonna cover the really major plot points. Feel free to point out if I get something wrong.

Shanks never meets Luffy so he never looses an arm and keeps his straw hat. (Presumably this would mean he wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúbetting on the new era‚Äù which maybe means he actually goes after the one piece but I‚Äôm not gonna change the story for stuff like that.) also bandit dude lives.

Luffy never meets Ace and Sabo. This I don‚Äôt think changes a whole lot considering Ace and Sabo already planned on becoming pirates, also it means bluejam probably doesn‚Äôt get involved with them because they hide and Luffy doesn‚Äôt open his mouth. Sabo still ‚Äúdies‚Äù but, Ace would‚Äôve still escaped the fire with Dadan. This leads Ace to still be motivated to leave at 17 to become a pirate. Sabo is still probably rescued by the revolutionary army considering the reason Dragon is there is because it‚Äôs his hometown and he‚Äôs showing his members the injustice of it all not because of Luffy.

Koby works as a Cabin Boy on Alvidas ship until she inevitably gets killed by other pirates. He then is insignificant.

Zoro is captured and starved/killed by Morgan.

Buggy takes over Orange Town, probably would eventually be captured by a Marine coming to save the town.

Nami continues stealing from pirates until betrayed by Arlong who then kills her and the townspeople. Arlong would probably try taking over the whole of east blue, like buggy though, he is probably captured by Marines at some point.

Ussop is killed by Kuro, or he does nothing. Either way Kuro inherits Kaya‚Äôs fortune. He kills his crew and lives happily ever after, probably.

Sanji continues to work at Baratie. This is interesting because it is implied that Krieg only survives against Mihawk because Mohawks interest is instead devoted to the ‚Äúfight‚Äù against Zoro. In my version Mihawk just kills Krieg and enjoys a nice meal before departing. Sanji works as a chef for 2 years until Germa 66 forces him to marry pudding. Sanji would actually be happy about this since she is cute and he has no other obligations, but he and the rest of Germa are wiped out on the wedding day.

Moving to the grand line...

Laboon dies from head butting the redline too much. Brooke never gets his chance to fulfill his promise. 

Chopper is probably killed, or just lives a miserable life. I honestly don‚Äôt remember much of drum island tbh.

Crocodile takes over Alabasta. Kills off the Nefertari line and probably kills Robin for not telling him where Pluton is. If she decides to spill the beans, then he wages war and it would become an entirely different series, so I‚Äôm just gonna say he just decides to be king of Alabasta.

Enel is king of Skypiea, maybe try‚Äôs to come to earth, gets his shit kicked in by an admiral. Or he just ends up on the moon still.

Franky gets killed probably and the world government gets their hands on the blueprints for Pluton, probably allowing them to subject the world more harshly and kill the remaining pirates, but for our sake let‚Äôs just say the blueprints are a dud/unable to follow, or iceberg/franky burn them before CP9 can get their hands on them.

Moriah is a lazy bastard and just lives out his remaining time stealing people‚Äôs shadows. 

So Blackbeard unable to take out Luffy and turn him in for a spot in the Shichibukai, probably sets his sights on another Supernova. Now the next part greatly changes what would happen in the world. It has to do with whether or not Ace catches up with Blackbeard before he captures his target. For the sake of making things more interesting we‚Äôll say he does catch up and is captured and turned in by BB leading to BB gaining a spot in the Shichibukai. 

BB then still tries to break into Impel Down but his crew is wiped out by Magellan since there is no riot and Shiryu is not set free meaning no antidote. 

Marineford war still goes down as the World Goverment still wants to set an example by executing Ace. This time it is a resounding Marine victory as Luffy isn‚Äôt there to free Ace and They execute him the way they intended. Whitebeard still looses his life this time to the Admirals after trying to sink Marineford. Shanks still presumably comes to stop the war.

Into the new world...

Fishman Island is probably eventually taken over by Hody, although probably wiped out by Big Mom considering that idiot was gonna kill the population and he doesn‚Äôt look like he knows how to make candy. Either way he dies as his plan to kill the kings of the world was stupid.

Seemingly Law would still become a Shichibukai but his plan to kill Doflamingo would falter. Maybe he tries allying himself with another new world pirate, but yeah that plan was pretty much hinged on the strawhats.

Doflamingo would still be king of Dressrosa, he seems very scared of Kaido so I think he would just continue to make Smiles for him. 

Zou is wiped out by Jack, and after some digging finds Raizo and the road ponoglyph. 

Kaido and Big Mom would fight a huge war based on the ‚Äúfree‚Äù territory in the fallout of Whitebeards death. I don‚Äôt think the remaining Whitebeard pirates could‚Äôve put up much of a fight, and because Blackbeard is dead I can‚Äôt see another pirate who could come and take it. They also now have the full capabilities of the SMILES in Kaidos case and the technological power of Germa in Big Moms case. I think Big Mom would edge this fight since I put more stock in the power of Germa than the SMILES. Also maybe Caesar is able to produce giants. This would lead to her taking most territory in the new world. Also she would most definitely be able to snuff out any Wano rebellion either from the scabbards or Supernova pirates. She would also have 3 of the 4 road ponoglyphs. With pudding being able to read them.

This would of course lead to direct conflict with the Red Hair Pirates and probably the World Government considering how close she would be. So from here, either she looses and basically the World Government takes control of everything or she wins, finds the last road ponoglyph, becomes the Pirate King. Depending on what that implies, the earth could just become one big Tottoland where everyone is happy and gives part of their souls to the ruler of the world Big mom.

So the big winners here are Kuro, Crocodile, Moriah, Enel and Big Mom.

People born with the Will of D get to choose how they die, apart from natural causes like cancer or old age. This may be why Im is shown to be more hostile towards Luffy and Teach, implied by the state of their wanted posters. This may also mean Im is a god-like being with the power to ‚Äúextinguish any light from history‚Äù other than the descendants of D. This would also make people carrying the title of D. the only threat to Im‚Äôs existence.

The Gorosei obeys Im because they do not possess the Will of D., along with the rest of the World Government. Garp being another figure who may know the entire truth, Oda may choose to show inner conflict within Garp where he cannot hedge his bets on the remaining D. descendants to stop the World Government and losing his family in case they fail.

fgrb6y,chitt12,Robin backstory - Essay,"There are a few people who don't appreciate Robin's backstory. I don't expect to change your opinion, but let me put another perspective to the situation where Robin for the first time puts her wish in the words, 'I want to live.'

Robin had been running all her life. She lost her home and people she cared about. She had a huge bounty since her childhood, so everyone she met would just try to sell her out. Anyone in her position would have turn to the dark side. But she just SURVIVED. Until Alabasta, where she met a random pirate crew who actually cared for each other. She had never seen that feeling of 'care' or depending on someone. She took a chance and asked Luffy to join the Strawhats, she was welcomed with smile and celebrations. She felt like home with bunch of strangers for the first time in her life. 

When CP-9 threatened to hurt the people who cared for her, she thought, it would be better to just surrender. Because she wanted to die with a feeling that somebody actually cared for her. She might afraid because what if Strawhats would come to know about her ties to CP-9 and World Government, Strawhats would turn their backs against her as they are no where close to fight a whole fleet and CP-9. She was afraid for the fact that they would call a Buster call, if she wouldn't corporate. So she turned her self in, just so she can die with a few happy memories without spoiling it. (Also, saving the Strawhats and giving them more time to improve their skills)

(At Ennies Lobby) When she was ready to die, the whole crew brought the chaos in the gates of one of the Marine Base, (which is pretty insane) for someone they only knew for a few days. Their chances are still not good of getting out of Ennies Lobby, which she knew, but Luffy asked for only one thing in return. To put her wish in the words. Luffy wanted her to believe that there are people who has got her back, regardless of the situation.

After a long life of running from one place to another, she finally found, not just one, a group of people who wants her to live and sail to the end of the Grand Line. Most importantly, Strawhats didn't even know or care for her abilities (i.e. able to read Poneglyph) nor they knew of her past. 

I don't know if you have ever lost the feeling of hope, I really wish you won't. But having the feeling of Hope when you are about to Die, is something beyond comparison. When she said, 'I want to live' ... It is one of the most painful and hopeful scenario I had even seen.

fgr96c,KillaKast16,My theory on the Will of D,"Right now we know of powerful people who carry the Will of D. 

- Monkey D. Luffy
- Gol D. Roger
- Rocks D. Xebec
- Blackbeard D. Teach

# Observations
1. Powerful anti-Celestial Dragon **Good-hearted** people carry the Will of D. *(Monkey D. Luffy, Gol D. Roger, etc).*
2. Powerful anti-celestial dragon **Bad-hearted** people carry the Will of D. *(Rocks D. Xebec, Blackbeard D. Teach).*

# My theory:
In the Void Century, when the world government was emerging, or in response to their rule, there was a rebellion. There was a tribe of people who wanted to overthrow this new figure. *However*, there were two different strategies on how to do this. There were those who wanted to simply eliminate the force and **make the world a better place**, *(Monkey D. Luffy and crew).* And there are those who simply want to overthrow the world into Chaos (Rocks D. Xebec and Teach). I believe in the Void Century the bad faction beat out the good faction resulting in a failed rebellion.

## This explains
Why some bad people carry the Will of D. It is because they are part of a different faction that has the same goal, (overthrow the world government), but their methodology is completely different. For Luffy, to fulfill prophecy and change the world, he first has to stop the plan of the other faction (Blackbeard D. Teach), and then bring down the world government.",5,1583899644,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgr96c/my_theory_on_the_will_of_d/,OnePiece,1
fgr8ib,SauceMeistro,What happened at the Reverie (Spoilers),"There are two things going on right now involving an incident at the Reverie. One involves the Alabasta Kingdom, and another is Sabo. 

We know someone died, and it is either suspected to be Sabo, Vivi or Vivi's father, King Cobra of Alabasta. 

My solid belief is that Sabo died, and here's two reasons why I believe that.

1. The number of people that knew Sabo that were either shocked or in tears upon reading news content regarding him (his ""brother"" Stelly said that he was in Mary Goise, so this involves his attempt at rescuing Kuma) (Makino, Koala, Dragon, Ivankov, the bigger lady with dreads that I cant remember her name), the bigger lady said something important in one of the translations. 

""We just found out he was alive! How can this be true?""

Let me say something about this as well. They discovered Sabo was alive around the time of Dressrosa. She would not be in utter despair upon learning something such as him being caught. Also why mention that they just found out he was alive if he didnt die?

2. Blackbeard says something that proves this theory. He is at beehive island upon reading the news here, and he says that ""instead of letting it land in the hands of the marines, Id much rather take it for myself"".

We know that Blackbeard and his crew were after Sabo's devil fruits as well as other powerful devil fruits, so it makes sense that on the SAME PAGES OF EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT SABO, BLACKBEARD IS REFERING TO THE DEVIL FRUIT THAT ACE AND SABO USED, which means Sabo has died.

About the Alabasta Kingdom, the main hint for what happened involves Walpol. As Morgans is talking about leaving the area due to being discovered and was almost blackmailed by Cipher Pol, someone says that Walpol just leaked some information to them. 

Heres what I presume: Vivi was with the strawhats from the beginning of the grand line up until Alabasta where they departed due to Vivi having Royal duties and the presence of the Marines after Crocodiles defeat. This means that Walpol knew Vivi was with them in the Drum Kingdom, which he got punted half the world away by Luffy. Knowing that Walpol could not possibly get revenge on Luffy and crew due to a vast difference in strength, he decides to get revenge by leaking that Vivi was with Pirates, which would be a crime considering that Alabasta is part of the World Government Alliance. After that is leaked, the government takes action and decided to punish the Kingdom in some way.

However, when Shanks asks WB about it, he gives the impression that if he didn‚Äôt send Ace there‚Äôs be no justice, and he reiterates the iron rule of his ship. Also, at the execution, WB falsely claims that it was his fault for this ordeal because he sent Ace after Teech. The WB Pirates all agree with WB, except Ace who is visibly stunned by the false confession.

fgqete,Drogaritory,Why does it take so long for anything to happen in this?,"I don‚Äôt know everything feels like it drags on for way too long in this show. A story arc or story beat that would take another show maybe 25 episodes to complete, these guys will take 100 episodes to do so. I don‚Äôt read the manga but I‚Äôm not just talking about the things the anime animators do to stretch the pacing, I‚Äôm talking about the actual story itself. I just finished the whole cake island arc and it feel like that thing took years. A simple story about Luffy going to BM‚Äôs territory to get Sanji and Sanji finding a way to refuse Big Mom‚Äôs Wedding Arrangement turned into this whole thing with Bege and Jimbei and Fishmen and Germa 66 and alll that. I don‚Äôt know it just feels like instead of being focused in telling a well rounded, tightly knit story,the writer is just more interested in seeing how many new characters and plot lines he can cram in without it being a mess/disaster. 


I started watching this Wano arc and how slow it‚Äôs been progressing has kind of put me off. I‚Äôll probably come back in 2 or 3 years when it‚Äôs time for Luffy to actually fight Kaido because with the way this is going and with all the plot lines(Oden, Samurai, Time Travel, Worst Generation etc) it‚Äôs obvious this arc isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon.

I don‚Äôt like comparing but look at how well told the pain arc was in Naruto, there was build up to it and it took just a couple of episodes for them to tell a wholly satisfying story with a very fleshed out and well rounded villain. Significant Development of the main character, Intense Fight Scenes, interesting/engaging plot and cool new characters were all in this arc and it took them just what?

fgpxuf,WanderingFodder,I Know who ate Corazon's Devil Fruit,"So we know Corazon's devil fruit was never seen since his death.

Fortunately it is quite obvious who ate it!

It's none other than Stronger the horse on Blackbeard's crew. Doc q the owner of the horse is the doctor of the bb pirates....


Who else is a doctor? Law and was Law's homie? Thats right! Corazon..

The connections are all there


Secondly, we know Doc q will fight Brook at the end of the story due to his nickname and reaper like appearance WOOOOOOW


Brook's specialty is music and since Doc q doesnt have noise cancelling headphones it only makes sense that his horse will do the noise cancelling! That is a big brain move!

Lastly, the Blackbeard pirates seem to for the most part specialize in devil fruit powers that allow them to sneak and be deceptive
(Shiryu,Devon) 

This df would give the Blackbeard pirates a sneak rating of 110/100.

fgoeiy,GumsGang,"One Piece Journey Chapter 17: Cabaji vs Zoro conclusion, also Buggy and Shanks?!","Whew, this chapter has me excited and interested for a lot of reasons, but before any of that let‚Äôs discuss the main event. Cabaji and Zoro face off in this panel, I really like the contrast between Namis' worry and Luffy's excitement. We get more shit talking from both Zoro and Cabaji. I have to say, Zoro's determination is respectable and like I said last chapter, I definitely agree with him that an injury like that shouldn‚Äôt stop him from beating a clown like Cabaji. Nami tells Luffy how's she‚Äôs basically heading out, but we can see that Luffy has grown a lot on her when she asks him to team up again if he fulfills his part of the bargain. Cabaji throws out a metric fuckton of tops (seriously where was he keeping those?) which gave me flashbacks to that one guy in HunterXHunter who also had spinning top powers. He then unicycles up the fucking building for a downward thrust. Like I said before, I like Cabajis fighting style a lot because it‚Äôs basically just a circus act in the form of a fighter. Buggy goes in for the cheap shot, which at this point doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Obviously Luffy says ‚Äúno fuck that‚Äù which shows how he actually does care a lot about Zoro, but also about the difference between his and Buggy‚Äôs mindset as captains. Buggy was more than ready to basically cheat in order to win, whereas Luffy sees this as a fight between two men, and doesn‚Äôt feel the need to interfere, both because of his trust in Zoro, and him not being a fucking dickhead like Buggy. Zoros ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired‚Äù bait was awesome, and it shows that he takes his shit seriously, even when he‚Äôs fighting with a fucking hole in his stomach. The Oni Giri panel was satisfying as hell, and I really like that these impacts get whole pages dedicated to them. Zoros ‚ÄúNot a common thief, but a pirate‚Äù was a great character moment as well. But it looks like Zoro is out, leaving Buggy and Luffy. It‚Äôs going to be our first real Main Event battle, seeing as Morgan and Alvidas fights were both less than a chapter. But before that we get Buggy‚Äôs reaction to Luffy saying he wants to be the pirate king, which like everyone else‚Äôs, is complete ‚Äúwtf‚Äù. It‚Äôs understandable though, since Luffy isn‚Äôt even at grand line and is already making these claims. 

&amp;nbsp;

But then we get the big bombshell reveal of this chapter, Buggy knowing Shanks. I have to say, this shocked me when I first read it, so much so that I had to do a check to make sure I had it right. But yeah, Buggy knew Shanks and that makes me very, very excited. We might get history on Shanks, as well as how they ended up meeting, and where Shanks might be now etc. it‚Äôs a big reveal done very well, it‚Äôs not like Buggy just goes ‚Äúyou like Shanks because reasons,‚Äù he actually knows about the Straw Hat. Overall it was a reveal that I‚Äôm very excited for, and combined with the already great fight makes for one of the best chapters so far.",24,1583887222,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgoeiy/one_piece_journey_chapter_17_cabaji_vs_zoro/,OnePiece,1

fgo7a2,Soul699,My prediction is becoming true [SPOILER CHAPTER 973],"With the new chapter, we have now confirmation that Denjiro = Kyoshiro. The question still lurk to this day tho: who is the traitor? Well, I think the anime already hinted it. You see, the anime already hinted at Denjiro being Kyoshiro in the opening, showing Kyoshiro in the rapid succession of the scabbards. Granted, it could have been a simple coincidence and Kyoshiro appeared there just for filling the scene, I won't deny that possibility. But my point is, that the anime for a while, has made some...interesting additions on a certain character screen time. That person being O-Kiku. I initially thought that they were simply teasing the reveal that Kiku was a trans, but the more they added, the different they were painting him. Like the anime was suggesting that Kiku was hiding something much more...sinister. Here's all the suspicious additions the anime added:
_When the scabbards get sent to the future, the camera pans for a few seconds on Kiku face but without showing his eyes, and they also show him smiling deviously, until the group get reached by rebels.        
_when Kaido arrive at Okobore Town, Kiku is the third to rush towards the village, after Luffy and Law who is trying to stop him. And even more, when Kinemon stop Kiku from going he also ask why Kiku want to go there, and Kiku actually take a couple of seconds before answering that ""he's worried for O-Tsuru-san"". Now, what if Kiku actually wanted to go there to tell Kaido about the position of the scabbards and Luffy crew?                
_After Kaido boro breath, Kinemon was momentarily got buried under some trees, and when he get out, he call around for Kiku, who then show up. The suspicious part is that Kiku was shown first already watching Kinemon while he was getting up. Like if he was checking if he was still alive, and if it was the case of revealing himself or stay hidden.                  
All these moments led me to believe that someone on the anime team know that Kiku is the traitor, and decided to drop hints here and there. Heck, it might even be a request that Oda left on one of his notes (I'm talking about those notes that Oda started giving to the anime team of things he couldn't put in the manga due to time restraint). I can see it being something like: Kiku is the traitor, feel free to leave some hints, but DON'T make it obvious. You'll probably wants some manga evidences as well:                  
_when the scabbards arrived at Port Itachi, Kiku was the only one with a unfazed expression. Sure he had a mask who covered almost all the face, but Kiku eyes weren't of someone shocked or in despair like the others. Those were the eyes of someone who was expecting it. 
_This is more for the motive of Kiku treason: remember that we still don't know who the father of Kiku and Izo is, who apparently got sent into prison by the people of Wano, who also treated Izo and Kiku pretty bad until Oden came. What if Kiku never let completely go of that hatred. And when Oden decided to continue travelling with Roger instead of staying at Wano and fix it, Kiku snapped and decided to side with Orochi?             
_Just to make it clear, the traitor MUST be one of the time travelling scabbards. The reason being that the samurai rebels wouldn't have been able to walk freely and prepare if the traitor, which constantly informed Orochi of every movements of the rebels was there. We can exclude Kinemon because he could have killed Momo many times while they were alone after separating from Kanjuro. Momo is also to exclude. The only ones left are Raizo, Kanjuro and Kiku.",13,1583886396,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgo7a2/my_prediction_is_becoming_true_spoiler_chapter_973/,OnePiece,1

Nefertari refused and Donquijote left the position sometime later.
The thing I don't get is why there are other kings now? such as Neptune and others and they live in their own countries? Are these knew reigns made afterwards? 
I guess these 'new kings' such as Neptune are less important than the World Nobles... Can someone help me?

The traitor is Denjiro

He was angry he didn't get to kill Oden himself

Which is why, because he's the traitor,

He cried when he found out Hiyori was safe, as he definitely would have hoped she would die, and made his own master's daughter a prostitute

Denjiro was always evil

He literally then went on to serve Orochi, and he has kept Hiyori alive for the sole purpose of luring in the scabbards 

My theory is Oden was responsible for something happening to him or his family in his reckless days 

Not sure.

And as for present day Intel, it can only be assumed, being the mob boss, he has eyes everywhere, or a second traitor at the very least. (Likely Ashura if so.

fgl41d,Shanal9,Detailed One Piece Tier List For Alive Characters,"The order of individuals within a certain tier is from strongest to weakest, though the gap can be very small. It doesn't imply that the higher one in a certain tier would always win against the lower one in same tier, either, as that's more match-up dependent. Just in general, though, yeah. Characters occupying same spot in a tier list means they're roughly equal in terms of feats, portrayal and hype.

Left out the characters who know absolutely nothing about power-wise, as in Gorosei and others, given they might be World Leaders- but they don't need to be incredibly strong for that. Hype and feats taken in for characters we know at least somewhat about. Likes of post-skip Lucci and whatnot are left out, too, as our knowledge of them are limited to just movies.

***----------Transcendent:***

Buggy The Clown.

Mohji The Beast Tamer

Cabaji The Acrobat

Richie

***----------S Tier:***

**-Kaido of The Beasts:** The strongest creature.

**-Charlotte Linlin**

**-""Hawkeyes"" Dracule Mihawk:** Could very well be below original admiral trio. Him and Shanks remains a controversial topic, though given the WSS title, as well as Vivre Card (alongside Oda putting him in same bracket as Shanks and Whitebeard in SBS), I'd put him slightly higher.

**-""Red-Haired"" Shanks**: Again, could very well be below original admiral trio, this is just based off of personal opinion of general (not super recent) Yonkos being overall superior. Plus, I think he has some portrayal to be considered above 'em. 

**-Akainu/Kuzan/Kizaru:** Always portrayed in more or less equal light, having similar experience within navy and whatnot. The battle between Akainu and Kuzan took ten years, and Akainu's victroy could definitely be considered a match-up thing.

**-Fujitora/Ryokugu:** Both were portrayed in similar light at first. Other than that, we don't know anything about Ryokugu. Both are admirals, so gap would be minor anyway. Putting these two below the original trio mostly because of the latter having more experience, being admiral for longer period of time, and being overall just more hyped ones.

***----------A Tier:***

**-Marshall D. Teach:** Was already on Yonko Commander level pre-skip. Got Whitebeard's insane DF, then had two extra years to master it and get even stronger and whatnot. Is one of the Yonkos now, though portrayed to be weakest one.

**-Monkey D. Garp**

**-Sengoku**

**Monkey D. Dragon:** Worst criminal due to his leadership within Revolutionaries, but otherwise his hype portrayal considering individual strength isn't really all that... insane. His subordinates, while strong, aren't really all that comparable to top Yonko Commanders. Sabo managed second in command even before getting Ace's fruit. With that said, don't see him below the said Yonko Commanders, even if it's Ben. 

**-Ben Beckman:** His Vivre Card states that he's ""comparable to Red-Haired"", though not specifying much about comparable in what. That aside, in Manga it's been stated that Shanks' crew is the most well-rounded one out of all, with highest average bounty (and that's considering likes of King/Queen/Jack all have over 1 billion bounty, and other stuff about Beast Pirates, including Supernova involvement). Think he's earned enough to be portrayed as strongest First Mate by quite a bit.

**-Silvers Rayleigh**

**-Shiki The Golden Lion:** Out of prime, much like Garp and Rayleigh, though unlike them; he also ended up losing both his legs. He can make up for it, but... definitely a greater detriment than just aging.

**-Kong:** Can't really say anything about it. Was once a Fleet Admiral, which implies at least as strong if not stronger than your general admirals. Been over forty years since then, though, so probably way out of prime.

***----------B Tier:***

**-Marco The Phoenix:** Feats, hype, alongside the fact he was considered to be Whitebeard's ""Right Hand Man"" according to his Vivre Card.

**-King The Conflagration:** Appears to be second strongest within Beast Pirates judging by his alias. Can't really say much between him and Jozu, however. Though him being kiiiiind of parallel to Marco made me put him higher. Most likely has highest bounty within crew after Kaido.

\-**""Diamond"" Jozu:** Leader of WB Pirates' primary combat division according to his vivre card, other than that; his feats during Marineford.

**-Lucky Raux:** Is kind of hyped to be third strongest within crew after Shanks and Ben. Specializes in combat according to his Vivre Card.

**-Queen The Plague:** Appears to be the third strongest within Beast Pirates after Kaido and King. Ahead of Katakuri mostly because of her higher bounty, plus she actually managed to make Big Mom feel pain/discomfort according to viz translation.

**-Charlotte Katakuri/Monkey D. Luffy:** Have them tied here mostly because of their fight not being entirely fair, despite Luffy winning. Though the latter likely caught up during Wano, now that he's mastered observation haki on a better level and is working on the other one as well. This doesn't consider any hype from Luffy's potential battles in near future, just some logical thinking.

**-Sabo:** Had no idea where to put him. Personally, I think he should be quite a good bit lower, but... benefit of doubt, plus Sabo has pretty good hype and portrayal alongside being a fan-favorite, so eh... he'll probably be up here if not higher after he gets better at using his devil fruit, anyway.

**-Charlotte Smoothie:** Highest bounty within crew after Big Mom and Katakuri. One of the Sweet Commanders.

**-Shiry of The Rain:** Nothing concrete here, just based off of portrayal and benefit of doubt, since he's kiiiinda portrayed to be second strongest in BB crew. Though I'd personally put him quite a good bit lower, since Magellan (someone he was scared of back then, according to his Vivre Card) doesn't seem to be really... that strong compared to post-skip folks. Shiryu did have two years to get stronger, however.

**-Yasopp:** Hyped and portrayed to be the fourth strongest after Captain, Ben, and Raux. Since Shanks' crew is considered more well-rounded, it's fair to assume he's better than Jack and Cracker, who seem to be holding the fourth strongest within their respective Yonko crews as well.

**-The Nine Scabbards:** Though Denjiro, Kawamatsu and Ashura can make case for being stronger than others. Still, overall similar level? Putting them over Jack from Ashura's portrayal during his small fight with the former.

**-Jack The Drought:** Has higher bounty than Smoothie, though... his portrayal isn't really all that insane. Has been treated as a means to tell others ""hey, look, this character is strong as it messed up Jack quite a good bit effortlessly"" for a bit. Plus, Jack seems like bit of a troublemaker, wild, while Smoothie appears to be calmer in nature. Wouldn't be surprised if that's the reason behind his higher value- bounty isn't power level, after all.

**-Charlotte Cracker:** Gave early WCI G4 Luffy a hard as hell time, and would've likely won in a 1v1 then. 

***----------C Tier:***

***-*****Donquixote Doflamingo**

**-""Flower Sword"" Vista:** Might be here, dunno. Not much is out there about him, so anything one says has very little to base off of.

**-Eustass D. Kidd(?):** Personally I don't rate him as much... would've kept him under Law, too, but- I guess he has some hype? Portrayal? So far he's been just punching bag for all the big names across New World, so... this guy's the only person I personally don't want here, but I guess majority would put him at this spot? W/e.

**-Zoro/Law:** It's a toss-up, both have shown equivalent feats in terms of range and destruction, with the former due to his immense strength and the latter due to his DF. In terms of haki, they both managed to outclass someone capable of covering their entire body in it. Though personally I'd give Law some edge right now, though again, it's up in the air. Doesn't include the potential boost from Enma as no one can tell how good is it.

**-Jinbei:** Can arguably make the case for being higher than Zoro/Law, but just don't see him there portrayal-wise.

**-Jesus Burgess and general BB crew:** Correct me if I'm wrong, though Burgess wasn't all that impressive, was he? Some clashes with Sabo before being overwhelmed. Don't really know how to rank rest of BB crew, as they're all both featless, and hypeless, all while lacking portrayal, so... they're all tossed in alongside Burgess.

**-Urouge:** Managed to best Snack, and had enough left to fight Cracker afterward. Managed to escape alive, too.

**-Scratchman Apoo:** No idea where to put him. High bounty and a good bit of hype recently, I guess. Just giving him benefit of doubt- personally think he's a tier below, though (Below Drake, even).

***----------D Tier:***

**X-Drake/Sanji:** X-Drake seemed to be outperforming Sanji in the minor scuffle they had, though with the latter's suit, I think it'd be about even? Not to mention, Drake was one of the Flying Headliners within Beast Pirates, which is above Headliners such as Hawkins.

**-Weevil:** IIRC he took down several crews allied to Whitebeard, including one whose captain was once a division captain on WB ship. Don't really think he's much stronger than that, though. Above Hawkins given benefit of doubt, plus his bounty despite being an individual rather than someone with crew.

**-Pica:** Haki comparable to Vergo as far as feats are concerned. Without his DF, he seems to be pretty meh, but the DF in itself is incredibly powerful- in fact, I can't really  come up with a good way a lot of those higher in tier beating him if he manages to attain the complete size, mostly because they lack the single destructive power to bring him down before he manages to either reconstruct, or hide elsewhere- other than maybe Sanji with his observation Haki. Personally, I'd put him higher, but... eh.

**-Vergo:** Managed to give Sanji trouble in one-on-one combat. Owned Smoker. Gave Law some trouble. Good feats in terms of Haki.

**-Basil Hawkins:** Appeared to be outperformed by Zoro during their brief battle. Portrayed to be weaker than Law. Holds a lower rank than Drake within Beast Pirates. Other than that, he appeared pretty underwhelming to me throughout... his ability to cheat death is fine and all, but otherwise he seems lacking in terms of general combat prowess. Though while he's a Headliner, he got to that position almost immediately after joining, so that's a thing.

**-Smoker:** Hawkins is only ahead given benefit of doubt. Similarly, Smoker is only ahead of Boa due to... benefit of doubt, considering he had two years to get strong.

***----------E Tier****(This section is a tad wonky, but only because Ace is... a weird subject. At one point, he's a good hype and portrayal source to judge other characters, such as WB Captains and Magellen, but then he's also trash when it comes to feats, so it feels weird... For reference, I'm just going to assume Ace is more or less equal to early post-skip G2/G3 Luffy or w/e)****:***

**-Magellen:** I consider Magellen to be above Ace portrayal-wise, and I consider Ace to be at a defining strength when it comes to your general WB Pirates Division, so here he is.

**-General WB Pirates Division Captains**

**-Boa Hancock:** Above Bege and Killer purely due to benefit of doubt.

**-Capone Bege:** Has shown incredible endurance and durability. Lacks offensively quite a lot, though. Please correct me if I'm wrong about him.

**-Killer:** Not particularly good in that skirmish between him and Zoro, despite it being a 2v1 with Zoro having disadvantage of protecting Hiyori all the while. Though still giving him benefit of doubt as his hit apparently did a number on Zoro (though one can argue that it was the poison, given Oda did drew the grumbling section pointing towards his stomach). Still, benefit of doubt.

**-Ivankov/(Modified)Kuma:** The former's portrayal as the third strongest within revolutionaries, as well as the latter's portrayal to be somewhat equal to Ivan during Marineford. Not much else to say about them.

**-Cavendish(Hakuba):** His defeat against Robin aside (who seemed to somewhat counter him, and had plenty of time to react as Hakuba tried to blitz from a great distance), his portrayal as the Captain of SHGF First Ship, as well as a bounty well above 300 million should... say something. Too fast for Bartolomeo to keep track of, managed to block an attack from Doffy, and several other notable feats. Deserves to be up here. Though personally, I'd put him a tad higher.

**-Sulong Carrot:** Okay, okay, hear me out. She's incredibly fast and agile, true, much like Hakuba, but... other than that, I don't really see a reason to rate her that much high. She's lacking offensively, has little to no feats regarding Haki iirc, and while lightning strikes are cool, they're not really... THAT impressive. Though up for discussion, much like every other entry, of course.

**-Don Sai/Some of the stronger minks:** Has shown incredibly overall destruction capacity, and is significantly superior to Chinjao.

***----------F Tier:***

**-Chinjao:** From several clashes with Luffy. 

**Vice Admirals:** The ones we've seen so far in full action appear to be pretty damn strong. Even the admirals in past (Kizaru, Akainu, Aokiji, etc), when they were Vice Admirals were seemingly super strong. While these can be exceptions, and the one who fought against Hancock wasn't all that impressive, I still think it takes quite a good bit to reach this rank, specially since the gap between Admirals and Vice Admirals already seems HUGE. Another note; all Vice Admirals are confirmed to have at least one kind of haki.

**-Bartolomeo:** Broken DF ability as far as its defensive nature is concerned. Not that strong individually otherwise, though. Here mostly because of the fruit, and some benefit of doubt.

**-Jewelry Bonney:** Likely the weakest of Supernovas, but who knows. Benefit of doubt to be put here, I guess. Personally, would put her a decent bit lower.

**-Franky**

**-Brook/Robin:** Both have their own advantages over each other, and over Franky, too (though I think he's more or less clear-cut superior of the trio, given strength and durability).

**-General Yonko Officials:** Headliners within Beast Pirates, Officers such as Daifuku within Big Mom Pirates. Probably most of BB crew, too, if they're weaker than Burgess.  Some of these guys might be stronger than people above (specially likes of Perosperos), but this is just general level as we know far too little about them.

\-**General revolutionaries:** Like Koala and such. 

**-Stronger members from Donquixote Family**

**-Other Captains from Strawhat Grand Fleet/People like Kyros, Neptune, etc**

**-Nami:** With Zues, I guess?

**-Coby (and other Rear Admirals):** Managed to get promoted to Rear Admiral recently, plus a member of sword. So... assuming he's above Tashigi, I guess?

**-Tashigi:** Maybe? Is confirmed to have both haki (Vivre Card), as well as things like soru, etc.

**-Usopp(???):** Oda said Usopp will always be the weakest member of the crew... though I'd personally put him above Chopper now, specially after the observation haki was unlocked, dunno.

**-Chopper:** Would be higher if he could control Monster Point for longer than just five minutes. Though I don't really remember most of Chopper's recent feats, so correct me if I'm wrong?

***----------*****Other Fodders Down Below in G Tier*****----------***

***----------*****Less Detailed ranking of primary Antagonists From Pre-skip**

\-Enel: Trash durability and endurance (not counting logia hax), but most likely (by far) the most striking power of any other pre-skip primary antagonist.

\-Oars with Luffy's shadow

\-A Pacifista: took hit from Post Thriller Bark (where our protags were stronger than during Enies Lobby) Ashura + G3 + Diable Jinbei after already being weakened from multiple hits from Strawhats.

\-Pre TS Lucci

\-Pre TS Kaku/Jyabura

\-Unbuffed Moria: Correct me if I'm wrong.

\-Most of Cp9

\-Alabasta Crocodile: Mostly because Luffy needed g2 to deal with usual Cp9 members, and EL G2 Luffy is MUCH stronger than base Alabasta Luffy.

\-Mr.1

\-Arlong

\-Kuro

***----------Scumbag Tier***

**-Orochi**

Nami without Luffy: Arlong's slave for eternity

Usopp without Luffy: Killed by Kuro's men

Chopper without Luffy: Never would've trusted or liked humans

Sanji without Luffy: Killed by or beaten up badly by Don Kreig and would've lost Baratie

Robin without Luffy: Killed by Crocodile

Alabasta without Luffy: Ruled by Crocodile

Franky without Luffy: Probably arrested by WG

Brook without Luffy: Forever stuck in Thriller Bark

Laboon without Luffy: Slamming his head until he dies

Dressrosa without Luffy: Ruled by Doflamingo

Shanks without Luffy: Will have two arms

Buggy without Luffy: Would still have his old crew

Wano without Luffy: Probably would stay under Kaido's rule for a very long time

Bege without Luffy: Killed by Big Mom Pirates after pathetic assassination attempt

Germa without Luffy: Would eventually make Yonji marry Pudding and then they'd all die to BM Pirates

Fishman Island without Luffy: Probably overtaken by Hody Jones

Impel Down without Luffy: None of the prisoners would've ever been freed, which means Jinbe would still be in prison

Law without Luffy: Killed by Doflamingo

fgk3am,Shadab330,The 20 Year Master Plan ‚Äì The 2 Traitors Of Wano,"
DENJIRO‚ÄôS 20 YEAR MASTER PLAN
To get this out of the way, I think there were 2 traitors involved. First one, was 20 years ago. I think¬†Kurozumi Higurashi was the spy 20 years ago.
There was no other way she could‚Äôve gotten close enough to Momonosuke to touch his face to change to him. If she can get close enough to touch Momonosuke, she could‚Äôve very well gotten close to know of the Scabbards‚Äô ambush.

The Zou Factor
20 years ago, Kozuki Oden tells the Scabbards that when the time is right, they have to visit Zou, and it is he place to go. I think this is significant.
Kyoshiro knows of this too. So when he gets the news of the Scabbards‚Äô return, he knows that they‚Äôre definitely going to Zou. To help Jack go to Zou, I think he gave Jack Nekomamushi/ Inuarashi‚Äôs Vivre Card. Why not Kinemon‚Äôs or Kanjuro‚Äôs or Raizo‚Äôs ? He couldn‚Äôt make Vivre Cards of them. They time-leaped before he could make it. He only has Nekomamushi, Inuarashi and Ashura Douji‚Äôs Vivre Cards. But this is all part of Denjiro‚Äôs plan.


Hiyori‚Äôs Role
During the alliance gathering to discuss the time and place of their attack, Hiyori was present. She learns of all the plans of the alliance and she tells Denjiro everything. Denjiro tells Orochi of these plans¬†selectively¬†, gaining his trust more than ever.
Komusrasaki‚Äôs ‚Äòdeath‚Äô
When Komurasaki slaps Orochi, Kyoshiro slices her and ‚Äòkills‚Äô her. I think the slapping and the slicing was all part of the plan. Denjiro asked Hiyori to slap Orochi so that he could have resin to ‚Äòkill‚Äô her, thereby allowing her to finally drop the Komurasaki character, and spend time with the alliance.

If instead of getting ‚Äòkilled‚Äô, she just runs away to the alliance, Orochi is gonna have men looking for her left and right. It won‚Äôt work.


The Master Stroke
By gaining the trust of Orochi, he has made sure that he gains control of the entire Flower Capital, and by extension, the entirety of Wano to an extent. Now he will be able to gather all of the alliance in one place, and also make Orochi think that he‚Äôs beaten the alliance even before the rebellion. But in reality, the alliance is now stronger than ever, and Orochi won‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre coming.

Denjiro has been waiting for 20 years for the Scabbards to return, while protecting Hiyori and gaining an immense trust from his master along the way. He actively tried to sabotage the alliance‚Äôs plans only because he had an even more incredible plan in mind.

Hiyori revealed her identity to the alliance, so that they would trust her and give her all the information she needed, she gives these information to Denjiro who passes it on to Orochi, and gains immense trust.

Denjiro has this planned for 20 years. He is going to save the rebellion when they funnel into the flower capital as per Orochi‚Äôs plan, and then lead the rebellion to Onigashima where the war is going to take place when Orochi least expects it.

The Traitors of Wano are definitely¬†Denjiro¬†and¬†Kozuki Hiyori.

fgiq2l,GenGaara25,Theory: Blackbeard is from Karakuri and was a Vegapunk experiment.,"I should preface this by saying I am brand new to the One Piece fandom only literally just finished the series in the last few days. I delved into lots of fan theories to see what the leading discussions were and stuff like that, which led me to all the Blackbeard theories. The triplets, cerberus, snow country [e.t](https://e.tc).c.

I thought of a new theory \[more an expansion of existing theories\] whilst reading these and I wanted to get peoples thoughts on it. If this exact one has been said somewhere before please tell me.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Theory:**

I propose that Blackbeard is from [Karakuri Island](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Karakuri_Island), the birthplace of Vegapunk and the home of one of his labs. As an orphaned baby, possibly from someone important, he was taken by Vegapunk as a guinea pig for his experiments into Lineage Factor and his continuing Devil Fruit research. These experiments permenantly changed Blackbeards body and would later allow him to be able to hold two Devil Fruits in his body at the same time without dying. At some point he was either discarded as a failure by Vegapunk, freed and left to die, or he managed to escape. Only to later be taken in by Whitebeard.

Whether he was born on Karakuri (rather than being taken there) or if this was where he met Whitebeard, I don't know. But as a baby I think this is where he was.

We know a Devil Fruit changes a persons Linear Factor and that Vegapunk was doing experiments with Judge into Linear Factor before he worked for the World Government. So if Teach was a subject of these Linear Factor experiments it may explain why his body can withstand multiple Devil Fruits. That's why the World Government wouldn't know about this since the experiment was performed before Vegapunk joined them. Also Marco states that Blackbeard body isn't normal which I think could hint at experimentation.

I think this also allows the incorperation of other theories: Blackbeard being more than one person could be part of Vegapunks experiment since he may have taken in more than one orphan, Karakuri Island is blatantly very cold and fits Blackbeard being from a snow country, it allows for theories to be open about Teach's parents, like the Rocks theory. 

It also could explain where Blackbeard learned about the Yami Yami No Mi, since Vegapunk would certainly own a copy of the Devil Fruit Encylopedia. Plus lots of things in this story lead back to Vegapunk, I wouldn't be surprised if Teach was one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR; Blackbeard is from Karakuri Island and is the result of a Vegapunk experiment, that is why his body can withstand two Devil Fruits.**",11,1583865906,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgiq2l/theory_blackbeard_is_from_karakuri_and_was_a/,OnePiece,1

fgihxb,Alpha_ii_Omega,Luffy is Uranus for sure,"This post has been mentioned before, but I would like to put a slight twist on it. I was inspired by this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/8nznlv/massive\_theory\_the\_boy\_the\_hat\_and\_uranus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/8nznlv/massive_theory_the_boy_the_hat_and_uranus/) 

Firstly, if you look at images of Uranus, you can actually see the image of Luffy's strawhat, imagining the rings of the planet forming a brim:  
[https://www.thinglink.com/scene/847538028678217728](https://www.thinglink.com/scene/847538028678217728)   
[https://youtu.be/m4NXbFOiOGk?t=146](https://youtu.be/m4NXbFOiOGk?t=146)

Secondly, as the theory I linked pointed out, Uranus has the strongest magnetic field (attractive force) of planets in our solar system. This parallels with Luffy's power to attract people to become his allies. **Mihawk told us that Luffy is Uranus**, when he said that Luffy has the most dangerous power of anyone roaming the seas.

You can't have 'the most dangerous power' and not be an ancient weapon. We know that those are the 3 strongest forces in the world.

But to differentiate this from previous theories, I believe that Uranus is Joy Boy's Will of the D, which Luffy inherited. We know that the Will of the D is passed down through generations, and I believe that each will has its own unique power and drive. I believe that Joy Boy's will is the power to turn people around him to his cause. Instead of just defeating enemies, he breaks them and gains their respect.

I know a lot of people would hate this. It makes Luffy even more 'the chosen one', which one one wants. But why not?

fgic9t,ErisGrey,Borsalino issue,"Borsalino(Kizaru) I think is far more intelligent than what he gets credit for, and I think I know what his underlying issue is. 

Some believe that his character is portrayed so slow in order to accent the speed of his Pika Pika No Mi. However, the main issue with his Pika Pika No Mi is that it theorhetically should be far, far more powerful than what they are. Nuclear bombs should be expected but the explosions are that of TnT bombs. 

Some people just have accepted that the Speed of Light in the One Piece Universe is just far far slower than our own. I don't think that's the case. 

We see that people can gain distance from him in just the time it takes for him to put his leg down after a kick. Or even just the time it takes him to react after being attacked my very low tiered pirates eg; spear through the head. 

We also know that he hate's pirates. So much so, that he's the one that comes with the Buster Calls, to destroy whole islands. His pedia page references his disdain for pirates as so: 

&gt;Kizaru has shown little to no mercy to any kind of pirates, as seen when he tried to capture the long-retired Silvers Rayleigh, and when he interrupted his mission to fight Basil Hawkins. It is later revealed that, in his frustration over this loss, Kizaru rounded up 500 pirates and sent them to the notorious Impel Down prison. This was shown again during the battle of Marineford, where he was merciless against the Whitebeard Pirates and their allies. When the Impel Down prisoners arrived on the scene, Kizaru accepted Fleet Admiral Sengoku's request to execute every single one of them.

There is one thing that's already been shown that can perfectly explain every single aspect of the Noro Noro no Mi. Similar to how stupid easy Alvida was foreshadowing the fierce Big Mama, I believe Foxy was foreshadowing a stupid strong pirate that can manipulate users time. We know the last user of the Noro Noro no Mi, died a little over 20 years ago based on when the fruit found itself to Foxy.

Using Oda's style of foreshadowing, I propose that Fox-y received the devil fruit after Rocks D. That Rocks D. built the crew that they did using the Davy Back Fights. That Rocks D. slowed Borsalino Kizaru to temper his destructive capabilities. 

Kizaru was slowed down permanently by the previous user of the Noro Noro no Mi to control his destructive power. It's why all of Kizaru's actions and thinking appear to be slow. He's having to use observation Haki similar to Katakuri's to combat his slowed movement. It's also why we don't ever see him run, just teleport to places (at slower than the speed of light), and why he has such hatred for pirates. I believe he is the admiral that works directly with Vega Punk specifically to find a way to cancel the slowing affects on him.",3,1583864446,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgic9t/borsalino_issue/,OnePiece,1

1: the one piece isn't a treasure like gold, and jewels and shit that's why Buggy doesn't care about it

2. Buggy is stupid and forgot the way to get to Raftel. Not too sure about this one but it could be a possibility since Buggy wasn't really an important member of Roger's crew. But this one is like 99.99% not true imo

3. One piece is underwater. This would make sense imo cos of the whole JoyBoy thing. And pluton and Poseidon stuff too.

fgg9s1,letsgomina,After Wano :- Towards The Future - Where should the Straw Hats Go ?,"With Oda revealing that he‚Äôs looking to finish One Piece in about 5 years, what else does the story have in store ? 

I will not be going over every single plot point in the story. I‚Äôll just go over what the remaining arcs and a few points of focus. 

* In my opinion, Wano will see the deaths of both Big Mom and Kaido. I think Big Mom will realise all the wrongs she‚Äôs committed, is going to understand that she was the one who killed Mother Carmel, and by some means become an ally of the Straw Hats for a few hours before she finally breathes her last. 

I think she will then realise that her dream of uniting all races of the world and everyone living happily, the real Totto Land, will be created by Luffy and she asks Luffy to resolve some sort of conflict that is taking place in Elbaf.

* With the War in Wano likely being the ‚Äòbig event‚Äô involving the Grand Fleet that Oda mentioned, I think it his highly likely that The Straw Hats visit Elbaf after Wano being lead there by Hajrudin. 

                            ** Elbaf** 


Here in Elbaf, I think Big Mom‚Äôs name would be cleared, as Luffy would liberate Elbaf, ( possibly from the tyrannical rule of Prince Loki ) under her request. 

I also think here in Elbaf, we‚Äôre going to learn more about the Road Poneglyph and Uranus. I‚Äôve always theorised that Uranus is a giant or a normal person who is located in a Sky Island above the ginormous tree in Elbaf. 

Basically Elbaf is going to be a *giant* info dump. ( see what I did there ? ) Maybe Like Zou v2.0. 

**Lode Star**

I think this would be a very short arc, like a brief visit to the island. I understand that they don‚Äôt have to visit Lode Star since they already have the poneglyphs with them, but I feel like it would be weird for it to be name dropped and for the Straw Hats not even caring to visit it. 

**Laugh Tale** 

This is the climactic battle between The Straw Hats vs The Blackbeard Pirates. 

This would be the battle in which Luffy awakens his Devil Fruit, against Blackbeard and his 3 Devil Fruits. 

Quick Side Note :- I don‚Äôt think Blackbeard will take Kaido‚Äôs Devil Fruit. Dragon, Oni whatever. This is because I think Oda is going for Luffy fighting against Blackbeard who has 3 Devil Fruits Luffy has never fought against before. 

Blackbeard has a really sad backstory in which his parents try to kill him for some reason so he had to escape by killing his own parents. That‚Äôs why he felt no remorse for killing Thatch or Whitebeard. He didn‚Äôt build any relationship with them as he was afraid of ending up the same way he did as a child.

The Straw Hats defeat the Blackbeard Pirates and learn of the truth. Unlike Gold D. Roger, **New Pirate King Monkey D. Luffy doesn‚Äôt laugh.** The Straw Hats have reached a different conclusion than what the Roger Pirates reached as said by Rayleigh. 

**The Final War**

Luffy will fight Imu in Marie Geoise, first declaring war by burning the World Government‚Äôs flag, and then by destroying the empty throne. Imu is the person who once created the Devil Fruits And is from the Void Century. She is the Sea Devil itself. Luffy and Imu fight it out with Luffy eventually beating Imu And Imu dying in some way. 

As I said before I haven‚Äôt touched on any of the other important plot points. Shanks, The Revolutionary Army, The Marines, The Dreams Of The Straw Hats, most of the others have been left out. The post is already long enough. It would take me 15 days to think about it and write. 

Also the story will 100% not be as linear as I wrote it out be. Oda is sure to blow our minds, with something extraordinary. 

This is just a post about what I think will be the next arcs, and a few key points, and nothing more or less. Thank you for reading.",11,1583856860,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgg9s1/after_wano_towards_the_future_where_should_the/,OnePiece,1

fgf9n8,boyplunger56,Theory - How would Xebec return/reappear,"1. I highly think that Rocks D Xebec would return in some form. So lets speculate how it might be.
2. It has been highly hinted that Blackbeard has some form of ""3 person/soul in 1 person"" body. Assuming this is true, the particular recent release regarding Ace's shock face and Blackbeard sisters was also somewhat a hint to that mystery too
3. When young Shanks and Buggy were talking about Blackbeard not sleeping, they refer him as the one wearing hat. This panel is weird to me because in the same scene, both Shanks and Buggy were wearing hats too. As though, it is emphasize to us that Blackbeard is always covering his entire head from forehead onwards
4. This has probably been theorized before that Blackbeard is wearing hat to cover his other ""bodies/soul"" on the head and highly likely, combine with Ace's shocked face, and the 2 sisters, could it be that the 2 other sisters live in Blackbeard body and you could see their faces on his head?
5. Now the most important part is that when Ace met Blackbeard and ask why Blackbeard killed Thatch, Blackbeard said that it was his carelessness/accident. 
6. Clearly, Blackbeard is strong enough to get the devil fruit without killing Thatch. He was strong enough to be able to harm Shanks even before his powers
7. So why was it accident? Could it be the accident was because of other conscious in Blackbeard body that he couldn't control? 
8. Doesn't sound right that it is his sisters
9. Could it be that Blackbeard, in order to pursue his dream, willing to trade one of his sister soul/body with someone strong or his idol or in this theory, Rocks D Xebec? 
10. Afterall, Blackbeard named his ship as Saber of Xebec, clearly seeing himself as a right hand man of Xebec.
11. Blackbeard was born 38 years ago exactly when Xebec was ""killed"" and also decided to make his base at Pirate Paradise where Rocks was formed.
12. This is how Rocks D Xebec would be revealed and return to One Piece, afterall Blackbeard did say in Jaya island, ""A man's dream will never die"".

fgezjg,Greyblueowl,Wano: Fight of two Dragons,"Don‚Äòt know if this was suggested before, if yes then please don‚Äôt hate me.

I had this one in my head for a while, why would Oda introduce us Momo as a dragon the first time we saw him? Why did he give him this specific Smile fruit?

Because Oda loves to give us the unexpected, and this one is shocking for sure.
I think that in the middle of the Wano War, Momonosuke as a dragon will attack Kaido in his respective dragon form and that will turn the war to Strawhat‚Äôs favor. However Kaido will obviously win their duel because of experience.
But how? With the help of Shinobu. In Ch. 924 Page 9 she stated that she uses the Mature-Mature ‚Äútechnique‚Äù to mature/rot anything she touches. The Wiki says that she ate a devil fruit but I couldn‚Äôt find the exact chapter. So what if under certain circumstances, Shinobu slightly touched Momo with her powers, enough for him to turn 28 (just for the plot) and he transformed in a respectively larger dragon.
I kinda hype this contrast duel between a blue and a magenta dragon. There is also a painting by Utagawa Koniyoshi which shows a blue and a red/grey dragon and given Oda who uses a lot ofJapanese references for this Arc, its not so strange.

I don't think this image was given by Yasuie. I think and I'm convinced that this is a part from Law's counter plan against Orochi.
He gave this false location because he knows there is a traitor int the alliance and the traitor is between scabbards. So if this false location is leaked to Orochi, it is confirmed there is a traitor among them.


That's why the 9 scabbards are alone in front of Onigashima.

The first place where it made me lift an eyebrow was when Sanji refused to attack Kalifa- now, if he'd rather die than hit a girl, that's his thing, but he was willing to risk if not outright sacrifice Robin, a crewmate, by sticking to the code. But that's still what it is, didn't think that much of it. Then there were instances such as when Sanji said it'd not be so sad to leave SH for Foxy Pirates because of all the girls surrounding him- but that can just be comic relief, I guess. Also belittling his dream enough to scream it's All Blue the moment he sees some pretty mermaids.

What made me post this thread is chapter 627, though. We witnessed entire Jinbei flashback for several chapters straight, and after it's all revealed, said and done in detail, Sanji outright just asks Jinbei to kill himself lol.

&amp;#x200B;

[Chapter 627, page 13th](https://preview.redd.it/75sr2bvc6ul41.jpg?width=616&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9cb878f028da594c6a5eabc6c088d22c01b18b)

Like, mate, Jinbei's 'crimes' are little to none in that regard, and after everything that was said and done, there wasn't much, if anything he could do at all in that situation. And you just heard the entire prospect of humans with their racism and torment towards fishmen, the tragic death of Otohime and this man straight up goes ""yeah w/e, now kys"". This is really beyond hypocritical to a lot of the things SH do and stand for.

Ik this isn't supposed to be a super serious side of his character, but... it's been kinda annoying, with a detrimental portrayal. Maybe that's just me. Nothing against Sanji otherwise, though, he's p' cool.",89,1583842416,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fgcux3/something_about_sanjis_character_that_always/,OnePiece,1

fgatpr,downtimeredditor,"With Oda saying back in 2019 that One Piece will conclude in 5 years, do you guys think it's enough time to truly finish the series or do you think it will rushed?","So even if we say 5 years from now is that enough time. 

It feels like we are very close to approaching the alliance fight vs Kaido. Now Luffys fight katakuri seemed like it lasted forever and he was only a sweet general. This is a yonko. So no offense to katakuri but leagues beyond him.

I think there is at least One more major story arc to go on which is Elbaf and what some consider Usopps new world adventure. Like Nami had Fishman Island, Sanji had Whole Cake Island, Zoro obviously has this one, Chopper well I could say zou and maybe punk hazard, but definitely Zou. So naturally I think Elbaf will be next for The crew and a story written for Usopp.

After that I feel like we'll enter endgame where many things will collide together. 

I'd imagine this story arc will end Kaido storyline for the most part. I'd imagine Elbaf will be where Big Mom's storyline will end. 

Luffy did indicate that he wants to beat all 4 yonkos back in Punk Hazard when discussing the alliance with Trafalgar Law. 

Obvious endgame will be Blackbeard. I honestly wouldn't be shocked if rox used some of the void century info to take place with Teaches body.  It there is the question of Shanks.

Oda definitely really goes into great complex detail into every arc that I kinda wonder if 5 years will be enough. 

So there are roughly 45-48 chapters released each year. Let's chose 45 chapters a year. In 5 years that would be about 405 chapters. But let's subtract 45 worth so the question is will 360 chapters be enough. 

I remember Oda saying in some interviews that the the battles near the end will get so intense that marineford will be any run of the mill battle and I'd honestly say even including Whole Cake Katakuri the Marineford fight was way more epic.  Wano seems to be the one that can potentially rival it. But Marineford saga was about 108 chapters about 122 episodes. Wano is currently at 64 chapters but I do see it approach 80-90 due to the Kaido fight. I also think Elbaf will be 80-90 as well. But like the final 2 Yonko fights willl be pretty fucking epic and Zoros match against Mihawk. 

As far as fights are concerned we have about 6 major fights we are looking forward to. Luffy and law vs Kaido. I'm not sure who Luffy will align with to fight Big Mom, but I do see Luffy Alliance with Kid to take on Shanks. Luffy is probably going solo against Blackbeard. I personally think Sabo will fight Akainu. And then not to forget Zoro vs Mihawk.

fg6pwm,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 16: Zoro vs Cabaji Begins!,"Before I even get to the chapter, I want to draw attention to the cover page. I really like the goofy portraits of Buggy‚Äôs main force, and I hope we get something similar for the other villains. Buggy pouring himself wine in the background, using his dismembered hands is just fun, and it makes you realize how convenient having a bara bara Fruit would be. Nami asking Luffy about his powers and Luffy just responding with the name of the attack was great, and I love the panel of Buggy and Cabaji emerging from the wreckage. I think Oda is a really good artist when it comes to making intimidating looking panels, even when Buggy is literally a clown, and has some of the goofiest expressions in the series, he can be thoroughly menacing when he needs to be. Which makes sense, because someone with a bara bara in real life would be fucking terrifying. Also Buggy and Cabaji using their crew as meat shields was a nice touch. Mohji caring about Richie makes him less of a dick, but he still totally got what he deserved. Goes to show even amongst each other the Buggy crew is underhanded as fuck. Buggy getting mad Mohji didn‚Äôt tell him about Luffy was another great comedy moment. Luffy kicks Mohji away, and with that, the fight between Zoro and Cabaji kicks off.

&amp;nbsp;

 It‚Äôs probably the first major fight this arc, since most of the action has been Luffy's crew running, and the two panels of Luffy beating the shit out of Mohji. Yeah I think this fight delivers really well. From the get go you can see the stark contrast between Zoro and Cabaji in fighting style. Zoro is very fair, using only the strength of his sword to fight his opponents, whereas Cabaji starts out the fight by blowing fire in Zoro's face, and then kicking him in his stab wound. The fight keeps going and it‚Äôs basically just Cabaji kicking Zoro while he‚Äôs down, this combined with him using his crew mates to protect himself makes him just as punchable as Mohji. Cabajis fighting style is fun to watch though, I like the dust trick and the fire breathing and the unicycle he rides on. I think it adds a lot of uniqueness to a fight that would otherwise be a generic sword duel. We see Luffy silently watching Zoro struggle, probably because he knows Zoro is about to kick some ass. But obviously the highlight of this chapter is what comes next, Zoro injuring himself. This is a moment that really speaks for itself, Zoro knows that if he‚Äôs gonna be the greatest swordsman, and injury shouldn‚Äôt stop him from beating a member of literally the Clown Pirates. Also it‚Äôs just generally badass, and it feeds into Zoro being the most traditional anime esque character in the crew, at least with the three we already have. So yeah that was the chapter, I‚Äôm looking forward to the next part of the Zoro vs Cabaji battle, and I‚Äôm a sucker for sword fighting badass guys so it should be a nice payoff to watch Cabaji get his shit kicked in.",5,1583807280,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fg6pwm/one_piece_journey_chapter_16_zoro_vs_cabaji_begins/,OnePiece,1
fg6psj,Kusokuso69,You think all the Calamities are transmen?,"First off, Jack is a Giant Grouper fishmen. Giant Groupers are all born female and some become male. Arlong and Hody both have two penises as a result of being shark fishmen, so as a result, Jack would have that as well.

Second, Queen dresses a lot like the Newkama, but he is also attracted to women, a trait not associated with Okama as we've seen in the story who explicitly state you should only be friends. This is problematic, but it's the logic of the story. 

Finally with King, he has an obviously masculine name, and dresses like a gimp. And we dont know much about him yet.

fg630c,lucapo98,Blackbeard connection to ancient weapons,"I really like to analyze low priority character because i believe they hide big secret, like this. 

To start I'm sorry for my English I hope you understand me

So do we know that Blackbeard probably went to alabasta to look for something and if he really looked for an ancestral weapon how does he know of their existence?

I think the answer is Avalo Pizarro, a former member of the kaido fleet. 

As we know the three superstar under kaido but Jack is 28 this means that during Oden execution he was 8 but during the flashback we can see king and queen shapes and a shadow with two horns just like Jack has.

Guess who has two horns too? Yes Avalo Pizarro

So during the last escape that kaido did he probably left Pizarro there and he hasn't been arrested because when blackbeard goes to impel down Pizarro doesnt wear prisoners uniform, most likely after his escape kaido left him there, and since no one visit the lower level, no one knew he was there.

As an ex superstar Pizarro probably knew some informations about ancestral weapons that kaido had from shiki or xebec and after joining BB he informed him.

[To be specific Pizarro devil fruit is a zoan mithological saber-toothed tiger type (u can see his shadow on the latest chapter while fighting with ashura doji and denjiro)]

fg41qg,africhic,Reverie Conflict Foreshadowing in CH. 823?,"I have been re-reading every Vivi/Vivi related panel looking for evidence of a bold theory and came across something a little interesting that looks like some neat forshadowing.


In chapter 823, on the way to the Reverie we get [this page](https://s2.mangadex.org/data/71774d0150ea1139cfb11d29483990a9/x4.png) of Igaram worried about Vivi. Note what he says, ""What if a monstrous bird were to swoop down and abduct you, a sniper lurking in wait, a meteor to fall from the sky?!"" Pell then mentions its fine, shes traveled with pirates which prompts Igaram to [shush him since Marines are nearby](https://s2.mangadex.org/data/71774d0150ea1139cfb11d29483990a9/x5.png). If you recall when leaving Alabasta, [Nami did the same thing to Luffy in order to protect Alabasta/Vivi](https://s2.mangadex.org/data/ce6f68637294ef2dff3b54ffa3896aac/x16.png). This is important later.


Anyway, recall what Igaram just warned Vivi about:

[Who can create monstrous birds that can carry people? Karasu of the revolutionary army.](https://i.imgur.com/IcBHlzf.png)

[Who can drop meteorites from the sky? Fujitora.](https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111127924/4595895-6828919087-009.p.png)


In chapter 925 [Blackbeard informed us that the Revolutionary Commanders and the new admirals clashed at he reverie.](https://s5.mkklcdnv5.com/mangakakalot/r1/read_one_piece_manga_online_free4/chapter_925_the_blank/11.jpg) Interesting what Igaram said before huh? Seeing as how thats where they were headed. I'm not sure where they sniper would come in, if anyone has an idea pleash share! 


We also learned a couple more things about the Reverie in chapters 956-957, among which was some news regarding Sabo, news regarding Vivi/Alabasta, an unnamed death and an assassination attempt (likely related to the aforementioned people), and the abolition of the Shichibukai system. 


One small detail that may get overlooked is that [Wapol calls Morgans with a ""leak.""](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/TOUBiOXUtKva1x-jp75nccxgDDi4rdHT-8wGajHQb-U20Jn2XrRH2XbbPIwXSNOnwFSh3od8obYoqorHZDAUoSuFgYFRdTQ0TYx8DEhxLJlfqOGOKtgPvKmFZMU8aE6F0Y1Wz-2OJg=s0?title=NzEuMjM2LjEyLjIwMg008___1574793975.png) What does Wapol know? Well we know there's some news that involves both Sabo and Alabasta. [Morgans previously published in the paper that Sabo was a sworn brother of Luffy.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/Z885t_eW1FHReDWwKjryS3wf2W3v-VQWxcVNzotjc1KdbIKfABaHuhm29LGfaoETSgJmsGV48iGhLA0L_mWg9JE_nFEwHj8g8grWprhIvsUfMZzLm-6wyh4HHFMkzadwgWrqufPqlQ=s0?title=NzEuMjM2LjEyLjIwMg008___1582341303.png) What does Wapol have to do with it? I circle back to what Igaram and Nami both did, protect Vivi's relationship with the Strawhats. Wapol knows about that relationship having run into them when they traveled together. If you dont recall, [Wapol is a punk ass bitch even hitting Vivi as a child.](https://pm1.narvii.com/6627/4500ba615ed7f9578d0027dc6c00f5b2166851ae_hq.jpg) Knowing Morgans has published Sabo and Luffy's connection, I think Wapol called in to let him know that Vivi is ALSO allied with the Strawhats. Previously, the relationship had to be kept a secret to keep Albasta safe, but developments with the Gorosei/Im targeting Vivi and Cobra seem to make that point moot now. 


Still didnt find what I'm looking for my more bold Vivi theory though, oh well :( Thought this bit my Igaram was interesting though.


tl;dr Igaram foreshadows the Reverie incidents while on their way there. And some additional speculation by me.",35,1583796193,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fg41qg/reverie_conflict_foreshadowing_in_ch_823/,OnePiece,1

ffzyph,Valentino_B,Blackbeard theory,"Blackbeard has two souls. One of them is his original soul (the soul of Marshall D. Teach) and the other one is the soul of Rocks D Xebec.

Xebec was the previous owner of the yami yami no mi. Observe that the jolly roger of the Rocks pirates resembles the yami yami no mi. 38 years ago, at the God Valley incident, when Xebec was about to be defeated by Roger and Garp, he used a secret technique of the yami yami no mi under which he absorbed his own soul with darkness and injected it to Marshall D Teach, who was a 2 years old slave of the celestial dragons. Roger and the marines thought that Xebec has died, however, he was alive inside Marshall D Teach. Marshall D Teach was aware of this situation because Xebec was trying to take control of his body. In fact, Xebec was taking control of the body, when Marshall D Teach was sleeping. This is why Marshall D Teach was not sleeping when he was a child. After a while, Marshall D Teach and Xebec got used to each other. Xebec was guiding and providing information to Marshall D Teach. This is why Marshall D Teach joined the Whitebeard pirates for protection and to look for the yami yami no mi. Xebec taught Marshall D Teach how to recognize yami yami no mi and steal devil fruits from devil fruit users. Recall that the name of the Blackbeard's ship is Saber of Xebec.

Sometimes Xebec was taking control of the body. For example, the one that sit next to Luffy in the bar was Marshall D Teach and the one that told Skypiea exists was Xebec. This is why Luffy and Zoro used the word ''they'' for Blackbeard at that time. The one that trembled in front of Whitebeard was Marshall D Teach and the one that fearlessly attacked Whitebeard and Sengoku was Xebec. 

The reason why Blackbeard was able to eat 2 devil fruits is because he has two souls in his body. This is why I believe Blackbeard cannot eat a third devil fruit.

ffzrzb,Nolar2015,Rocks Theory,"I think Rocks is IM. Hear me out

Rocks wanted to be 'king of the world' Who is the king of the world now? Im.

The government is hiding rocks' existence. Who else existence do they hide? IM.

The only reaosn we think Rocks is dead is because Sengoku, who is complicit in the hiding of information from the public for the government, told us. He has no reason to tell the truth

They're outlines are slightly similar, with similarly spiky hair. Thoguh rocks looks more simialr to gedatsu (Lmao imagine), its highly likely Rocks tied up his hair into spikes like Im

Now some issues with this theory- body shape. I think that Rocks was near victory in the fight against roger and garp, but his body was greatly damaged. He struck a deal to 'achieve his dream' and have Vegapunk rebuild his body, but with a catch, making him physically weak. He is king of the world, but a midget little imp to make up for it, and very easily beaten in a battle if the government ever gets tired of him. Or- he could just be an old man. Lmao. He was at his peak 40 years ago so im guessing hes 70-80. He could just be a hunched over short little geezer at this point, but i doubt oda would do something that lame (i hope)

They announced their victory, the 'death' of rocks, while secretly making him the most powerful perosn in the world. Sounds like somthing the government would do.

he cut apart Blackbeard's psoter, the only yonko not in rocks' crew, and Luffy, the only one near yonko level not in rock' crew. Why he cut down vivi, not sure.

So Lady Toki either knew it from him or from being a time traveler herself. Some things that don't add up are like, why send Momo to the future, but not Hiyori? Like why on earth would she let her daughter die? Going with Kawamatsu was no guarantee of her safety. Do you think she knew Hiyori had to be of age for some reason? I mean it has to be a plot device, if Denjiro is already inside the system, they really wouldn't need her to be. Maybe it has to do with Zoro. I mean Hiyori seemed shocked to see a three style swordsman, even after traveling the world with Roger's crew. Maybe Toki told her to find him? I mean she bucked and spilled her guts very easily in front of Zoro after hiding who she was for 20 years and then gave him her fathers sword. That is nothing small in context of the story.

In 973, kaido is dressed very similarly to katakuri. Leather pants and leather vest, kinda like a biker. Okay word, then i realized that on katakuris arm tattoo, he has a skull on the bicep. On the same arm, whatever it is thats on kaidos arm, he has a similar looking skull in the same spot. As well, the characters both have skulls on their belt buckle. I believe that oda has subtly been hinting that katakuris dad is kaido. 

It makes a lot of sense as he was born when the rocks pirates were together, and katakuris size and strength. If this were the case, it would allow for such an incredible character development for katakuri, considering his parents are allied against the one person he respects and views as an equal that isnt in his family, which is luffy. I personally believe katakuri will help luffy in some way againts big mom, and if hes the son of kaido as well, then it would allow for the sickest fight of all time, katakuri and luffy vs kaido and big mom.

ffy5z8,BFBooger,The cake is a lie: The No Traitor Possibility,"TL;DR

There are traitor-free explanations for nearly all of the things most people claim requires a traitor.  That doesn't mean there isn't one, but it does change or take down many theories.

**Is there a traitor at all?**

Its somewhat likelly, but not certain.  I am not saying that we have proof there is not a trator.  Instead, I'm saying we don't have proof that there is one.  Many of the 'hints' don't require a trator.  Before going into all the ways we might not have one, I'll say that my personal bet is the following:

40% -- Kanjuro, only because he could possibly make a clone of himself for the execution and is based on a paintor-traitor from Japanese history.

30% -- no traitor

30% -- multiple non-scabbards or a blend of events and people.  I have one particular 'multiple people' theory I'll talk about at the end of this post.  None of the Ideas in it are mine, but I've just pieced a few other people's theories together.

That is, I think it is less likely that there is a single 'one traitor explains it all' than other explanations, and at this point the ONLY 'single traitor' that I believe is Kanjuro.

&amp;#x200B;

## But, Jack got to Zou!

So what?   He had a Vivre card of Inu and/or Neko.   How did he get it?  Well those two were captured when fleeing Oden's execution.  Maybe Kaido had them made then let them escape so he could track them and maybe find Wano one day.  Its completely within his character to not kill 'weaker' opponents and turn them into tools, and not listen to Orochi if Orochi wanted them dead.

## But, Doffy/Kaido/Jack knew Raizo went to Zou!

So what?  Doffy had **Violet/Viola** who was shown observing events clear across the country when she wanted to.  She could also read Kanjuro's mind after his capture.  Determining who all the members of the group were and where Kanjuro/Kinemon thought they were would be trivial for her.   No traitor required.

## Kaido knew Oden was attacking!

There are ways he could have known this that don't require a traitor across time (others have mentioned the Old Hag), or there could be other ways to track some of the scabbards.   Because Oda had Kaido tease that there might be a spy, there is probably more to this.  ""more"" does not necessarily mean one spy across all the events though, it could just be the stuff from 20 years ago only.

## Orochi knows the plans!

Ok now we are really getting into what needs solid explanation.   There are a lot of possibilities here, and this post isn't going to go into all of them.  I'm just here to go over some non-traitor ideas or debunk the idea that this *requires* a traitor.

Orochi has some sort of informant that he trusts.  Someone on the inside.  Maybe he has Intel from Kyoshiro who is getting leaks from Shinobu if she knows his identity?  Maybe Hiyori had enough info to fill Kyoshiro in and produce the report to Orochi as part of his plan?  Maybe... the person that set Law free was not Drake, but it was Kyoshiro and Law and Kyoshiro came up with the 'let Orochi think he has won' plan together -- sure Law has been cut off from info, but he could have found out more details from his crew or from someone else he is in contact with.

I'm not sold on many of these ideas, but the point is, we can come up with lots of non-traitor ideas that can work out.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Thoughts**

My personal leading contenders to explain these things are as follows:

* Kaido got Inu and Neko's vivre card when they were captured then let them think they escaped on their own.
* Doffy used Violet to determine the info about Raizo
* 20 years ago: Kaido had an informant about Oden taking action -- either the old Hag or Denjiro -- the reference to 30 pieces of silver (Judas betrayal of Jesus for 30 pieces of silver) indicates he might make a traitorous mistake at some point and regret it soon after.  I agree with a theory posted here yesterday that maybe he had a bargain with Orochi of some sort (after all Oden did), and it went sour, and he is angry at himself for it.
* Present timeline:  Orochi is getting info from Kyoshiro who is getting it from Hiyori plus perhaps Law and using it to deceive Orochi.

That said, the Kanjuro explanation can cover all four of these or only one of them.  But I feel like it would require a LOT of explanation on his motivation that conflicts with what we know of him.  (and he had many chanses to simply kill off Kinemon or Momonosuke).  On the other hand, his character is possibly based on a historical painter that betrayed his master.   That could be a red herring though, as could the 30 pieces of silver.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, Oda has provided us with many ambiguous details so it is not plainly obvious.    I am now leaning towards the idea that it is not one single traitor, but actions of several people to explain the individual details.  That might involve both Kanjuro and Denjiro partially, and we know Law and Sanji are going to have some back-up ideas and plans.  Law blatantly is hiding from the alliance to scheme, and Sanji made some blatant comments about the floating lanterns with IIRC, Nami....  Schemers will scheme, and they all know Luffy well enough to know that they shouldn't inform him of possible schemes until the time is right.",4,1583774561,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffy5z8/the_cake_is_a_lie_the_no_traitor_possibility/,OnePiece,1

ffxbie,ahood34,What WG gained from killing WB,"I get it, Pirates are criminals and the World Gov hunts them. But Cipher whatever surely had to have the military intelligence to know that killing WB would be a huge mistake in terms of keeping the New World in order. 

Here‚Äôs what we know of WB Pirates:

1. They refuse to take part in the drug trade
2. They refuse to take part in the slave trade
3. They protect groups of people/species that are discriminated against/targeted (such as Fishman Island)
4. They use their treasure, not to accumulate mass wealth, but to feed it back into poor communities that can‚Äôt pay the Celestial Dragons
5. They adopt orphans, create homes for the homeless

I get it, WB is a golden era pirate and legend with a huge bounty...but the WG has to fully understand that luring him out and killing him will undoubtedly make the New World a more dangerous place with less justice and more cruelty. It just seems like, if the WG truly gave a damn about the people of the New World, WB would not be their target. I believe in the Ace Novel it says thousands of people depend on WB for protection. 

Someone in the WG had to have thought that killing WB was a bad idea due to the power void that it would create.

But here's the thing - Hiyori spent **SEVEN** years with Kawamatsu before joining Denjiro in the capital.  


This leaves a possibility of Denjiro spending 5-6 years just being consumed by his own anger in the shrine of Enma isolated in the mountains.  


There could of course also just have been a longer period of him being the boss and gaining Orochi's trust and he left the shrine a lot earlier than that, but it's a pretty big window either way.",24,1583763374,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffvahg/about_chapter_973/,OnePiece,1

Some of the fights hes won are bullshit and should have lost, he's had fuck all character development and no explanation of why hes so strong with no training.

ffte94,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 15: Gomu Gomu no Balloon,"We start off the chapter with Boodle confronting Buggy. We then get to see Cabahji, Buggy‚Äôs second in command, who‚Äôll probably end up fighting Zoro now that Mohji is gone. I like Cabajis design, and I really want to see how he fights, with all the crazy shit he was doing just off his intro. Like I said before, I think the whole circus theme really adds to the Buggy crew and makes them unique, and also fun to watch. Buggy tells Cabaji to shut the fuck up, which shows that he isn‚Äôt the kind of person to hide behind his crew members when he‚Äôs called out. It‚Äôs like before, he has this warped sense of pride but at the same time (as we‚Äôll see later this chapter) sensitivity about being a clown. It‚Äôs at this point in the arch where we really start to tackle the meaning of treasure. Obviously Boodle calls his village a treasure, with Buggy responding that treasure is jewelry, gold, etc. I think it‚Äôs executed really well, it flows with the story and makes sense with the characters motivations. Buggy then chokes out Boodle, who hits his own throat in order to damage Buggy‚Äôs hand. I really like this scene because 1. It‚Äôs fucking awesome, and 2. It shows how deeply Boodle cares about his village, even to a fault (which was stated last chapter). Buggy then states his goal of getting his hands on all the treasure in this world. It‚Äôs a cool scene, and I really like the coloring here with Buggy standing against the background of gold and jewelry. Buggy decides to finally blow Boodle up, but‚Ä¶

&amp;nbsp;

We see Luffy grab his hand before he could. Also, how was he gonna blow up Boodle while he was choking him? Wouldn‚Äôt it blow up his hand too? Luffy knocks out Boodle, which shows that he understands there are some times when you shouldn‚Äôt be fighting. Honestly, I think Luffy only let Boodle run off in the first place so that he wouldn‚Äôt feel useless, which was actually really cool of him. Then we get the line ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do anything unnecessary‚Äù followed by Luffy calling Buggy a big nose, which was fucking great. Here we get to see another one of his rubber powers. Gomu Gomu No Balloon is pretty great as well, it works as a counterattack to projectiles like bullets, but on a much bigger scale, for things like Cannonballs. Like I said in my other reviews, I think the rubber body opens up a lot of possibilities for powers and just looks really satisfying. Overall I really liked this chapter, I think it shows the themes really well, has good comedy, and good action. I really like Buggy as a villain, which is why I‚Äôm gonna miss him after this arc. Though it looks like the real fighting will start in the next chapter. If I had to guess, Zoros stomach injury will fuck him over, and Luffy might have to save him. Anyways, sorry for not posting yesterday, I was doing stuff with family.

fftd72,p0ppysmic08,Does anyone miss Oda's old art style?,"Ok, this is more of a technical aspect than what you think it is.

As I re-read One Piece manga from the start this 2020 one thing I've noticed is Oda's drastic change of art style. I will say that I was really in awe of his style from **Water 7 arc** up to **Punk Hazard arc** ( I'm thinking of a hundred manga panels just by typing this). I'm not saying those arcs were *""peak Oda art""* coz art doesn't really work that way. But personally, reading those parts of the story were the times I just catch myself looking at those panels thinking how well-constructed the art was. You can tell Oda is enjoying the hell out of those drawings. But it seems to have faltered a bit in terms of quality years going forward.

Currently, his art style isn't as clean as it used to. His lineworks are getting kinda blotty and some lines don't even connect anymore, making some characters/figures not as identifiable, therefore makes the reading comprehension a lot harder and demands more attentiveness (not including moments that SHOULD linger but because of the way it was constructed, don't really linger that long). Panels seems to be getting smaller and smaller, more cramped and unless you have a good imagination, the tone/pacing won't translate as well as Oda intended. You can just feel how rushed his illustrations have been and I know some of you notice that too. Now I know that this is nitpicking, I'm am nitpicking. And don't get me wrong, the story is still topnotch.

...so what exactly do I want? Well, I want Oda to regain that enjoyment of illustrating again telling this great story. I feel like he's in a rush to finish One Piece as quick and as epic as possible and I don't know if it's true but I bet he is kinda relying on the anime adaptation to revamp the story from the manga (knowing how much the animation quality has improved since Wano), and I kinda don't want that. I still want him to enjoy making it while it lasts and if he needs a break, give the man a break, right?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL/DR:** I noticed his art style is not as well-constructed as it used to and I feel like it's because he's doesn't enjoy illustrating the story as much, maybe from the pressure of finishing it or some other reasons and in the end I JUST want him to regain that enjoyment of making One Piece while it lasts.",11,1583753984,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fftd72/does_anyone_miss_odas_old_art_style/,OnePiece,1

fft4g1,KatuLatxa,StrawHat Crew's still growing up,"In this post I'm going to analyze shortly how the strawhat crew have grown and why is still growing up.

&amp;nbsp;

In pre-timeskip OP the crew was formet by 8 nakamas and the story toke place in two seas: East Blue and Grand Line. 4 of those nakamas joined  in each sea, and there were some similarities.

&amp;nbsp;

**EAST BLUE**

&amp;nbsp;

In East Blue Zoro, Nami, Usopp and Sanji joined the crew. 

Why these characters complete this start crew? Well, Mr. Morj in youtube explains it perfectly [in this video.](https://youtu.be/K782jkGeAe8) By the way, I recomend this channel; to me he's the best One Piece youtuber by far, great analysis and reviews. **It's important to know why nakamas are going to join cause this will let us speculate who'd join in the future.

The order they joined:

* 1 Zoro 
* 2 *Nami*
* 3 Usopp
* 4 Sanji

*Parenthesis: I know Nami did not officially joined the group the second one, but she temporaly unite force with Luffy and Zoro before join the crew and many sources count her like the second member or the crew, so lets count her the second one cause is important for the theory.*

&amp;nbsp;

**GRAND LINE/PARADISE**

&amp;nbsp;

In Grand Line Chopper, Robin, Franky and Brook joined the crew. The reason why these 4 joined the crew is more obvius: the crewmates a pirate king suitor needs to achieve his goal.

The order they joined:

* 1 Chopper 
* 2 *Robin*
* 3 Franky
* 4 Brook

*Like Nami, the second member in this sea is a female one, and she shares some similarities with Nami, but the most remarkable one is that Robin didn't look alike a crewmate at the beginning, she unite forces with Strawhats in a first place before she joined officially them.*

&amp;nbsp;

**NEW WORLD**

&amp;nbsp;

Now, in pos-timeskip OP, Strawhats start a new adventure and they're in a new sea. So, my guess is there are joining 4 more crewmates in this sea.
In New World Jinbei joined the StrawHats, so there are hypothetically 3 more to appear on the future, but this is my theory:

Why is the base reason of new crewmates in this sea? Looking at Jinbei ,the environment of this sea and the goals and relationship Gol D. Roger or the Pirate King must have I think the new crewmates would have a culture or race relationship with poneglyphs and the Empty Century/World Goverment. Jinbei is a fishman and we all know the fishmen relationship with this 2 topics. So, who will join the crew?

&amp;nbsp;

The order will be:

* 1 Jinbei
* 2 A female crewmate: the third one
* 3 (?)
* 4 (?)

I really; really believe that this female character will be Carrot for some reasons: 

* The minks relationship with poneglyph.
* They're realtionship with an important culture with the Empty Century like Wano.
* She unite forces with Strawhats before an official joining.
* Good balance in Strawhat crew and fighting skills.

&amp;nbsp;

An other option could be princess Hiyori, she has some similarities with Carrot in the base reason to join the crew, but we have not seen too much about what could she contribute to the crew, but I want to mention her cause she could make it.

On the other hand, the other two crewmates would join faster than we could expect: the third and fourth crewmate of the sea (like Ussop and Sanji, or Franky and Brook) join so quickly and in a short intermediate time.
 

I would theoryze about them in another post, this is too large so thanks for reading it a see later.",19,1583752615,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fft4g1/strawhat_crews_still_growing_up/,OnePiece,1

fft04z,Hrachy96,"SPOILERS: I know everyone is tired of Traitor theories, but","I have a theory.

I've been on Kanjuro, Raizo and Shinobu being traitor boats for a while, but I can't find any strong story point for them to be traitor. Also, I know that right now, we all might have thinking this about our favorite scabbard, but DENJIRO 'WAS' THE TRAITOR.

The reasons I've right now to think that are pretty abstract but here they are:

We all were sad and broken when Oden died, but who suffered most emotional pain were his close ones. Among them were his family and his scabbards. Lady Toki died after sending everyone to future (as far as we know), Momonosuke sent to future with 4 Scabbards and Hiyori with Kawamatsu. Those who stayed in that timeline, who among them was grieved Oden's death most? I'd give that to Denjiro. As he claims, he had so much rage that it changed his face.

Why did Denjiro had so much Rage and others didn't and on whom was his Rage on? Orochi/Kaido? Every scabbard must have equal. Even some others might have better reasons to have greater rage than Denjiro. But, his Rage was on himself.

My theory is, Denjiro was forced to cut out a deal with Orochi and this he told them about Oden's attack. He could've believed that Orochi might do some favor if he do as Orochi asked but Orochi didn't keep his end of the deal ( Obv r/fuckOrochi ). That revelation led to Oden's death and Denjiro resented himself for it.

That's why, his Rage changed his face, and then he started serving Orochi to ultimately betray him and win the war for Kozuki Clan. He leaked info. To Orochi just to gain trust.


TL;DR:

Denjiro cut out a deal with Orochi to get Oden saves but Orochi didn't keep his end of deal. Denjiro hates himself for Oden's death. That's why Rage took over him and changed his face. He's on Orochi's side right now to betray him at last.



PS: Now, I want Kyoshiro to kill Orochi.",36,1583751910,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fft04z/spoilers_i_know_everyone_is_tired_of_traitor/,OnePiece,1

ffseos,Stebbinator,My pick on who the traitor is. (Spoilers),"I think by now we're all getting tired of traitor theories, and the reason I'm writing this is because I too am tired of them (yeah, I know, it makes no sense). Anyway I wanted to give my opinion on this situation.

First of all, the traitor was already spying 20 years ago, so it can only be a character from Wano, but who? It can't be any of the scabbards, since they were about to be executed, and it certainly can't be Shinobu, because of obvious reasons. So who is the traitor? Well, the traitor is none other then Shinobu!

""But you just said it can't be her"" I can hear you say, and I know that perfectly, the reason why Shinobu is the traitor is that the Shinobu of our time isn't the real Shinobu from the flashback. I don't have any real evidence to say that for sure, but there are some discrepancies.

1. Her appearance: obviously she looks nothing like she did 20 years ago. I know, this can just be her aging badly, but she looks too young in the flashback to now look this old. Like I said, this can mean nothing and I'm just imagining things.
2. Her fruit: again, this one too proves nothing, but the fact that she doesn't seem to have the fruit in the flashback, can arguably be considered a discrepancy. She may have eaten the fruit later obviously, but we technically can't be 100% sure of that.
3. Her fear of sharp objects: this is the only one that is truly hard to explain. In the flashback she casually hands the scabbards their swords, but in the present she starts screaming madly when one of the oniwabanshuu throws a shuriken at her. That doesn't exactly sound like the reaction of one of the fearless warriors that fought Kaido's forces together with Oden.
4. She's the only one that we don't see what happens to after running away from the execution. I know we also don't see Inu and Neko, but they later lose a leg and an arm respectively to Jack, so it can't be them.

What I'm saying is that the present Shinobu is actually a spy sent by Kaido/Orochi, and that this was the same spy that Kaido talked about in the flashback, when she wasn't faking being anyone. Obviously I may be full of shit and thinking too deep into any of this, but I wanted to say my opinion.",4,1583748143,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffseos/my_pick_on_who_the_traitor_is_spoilers/,OnePiece,1

I imagine Wado Ichimonji will become an upgraded sword after this fight. I have a reasonable belief, then, that Zoro could hold the following swords when leaving Wano:

Enma, Nidai Kitetsu &amp; Sandai Kitetsu:

* Zoro may decide to place Kuina's sword in the Shimotsuki graveyard with Shusui, in an effort to respect the customs of her clan and to honour both her and Ryuuma.

Nidai Kitetsu OR Sandai Kitetsu OR Enma &amp; Wado Ichimonji

* Zoro may continue to carry Kuina's will with him through her sword until he becomes the world's strongest swordsman.

Chapter 956 :  Big News | 11%

Once more, not a real surprise here. Ultimate, took first place with 40.7% of the votes, and it's well deserved, the chapter was amazing.


###Most unexpected moment in the Manga of 2019.

* Number 1, with 26.5% of the votes &gt;!I don't know if this qualifies but the fact THAT we got the Yonko/PK bounties WHEN we did was a real-life unexpected surprise to us. Not the numbers themselves, but the fact that Oda just dropped those bounties on us without warning was great. If this does qualify then give it #1.!&lt;

* Number 2, with 22% of the votes &gt;!The Reveal of the reason why Garp was called the hero of the marines.!&lt;

* Number 3, with 19.4% of the votes &gt;!The revelation of the true nature of SMILEs. What we thought was an artificial fruit with a meaningless name turned out to be something far more sinister.!&lt;

* Number 4, with 18.7% of the votes&gt;!Kamazou being Killer. What stands out here is that nobody managed to connect a dual scythe guy literally called ""manslayer"" to the missing Kid pirate. Everybody was thinking ""he's Denjirou duh"". The biggest confounding factor was the uncontrollable laughter, which ties into the SMILE reveal.!&lt;

Do you agree with them? But once more, it shows that chapter 957 where the first two revelation were from, is the best chapter of the year.


###Best Manga Panel of 2019

This time, the panel is from the second most liked chapter of the year! And what a panel it was, when the chapter was released, I remember a lot of fanart and coloring of this panel, so there was no doubt in my mind it would win.

And that's all for the best of One Piece 2019! The Winner will soon get their reward (in form of platinum or Gold), and next year, there will be a best Nakama with and without Artur.

#We have new User Flairs! 

As you might have noticed, we have new user flairs for the subreddit! They are basic roles such as Pirate, Marine, Bounty hunter, and similar! I'm open to more suggestion on them, so feel free to share them and I will add them if they are good enough.

By the way, the winner of the user award for best of One Piece will have custom flairs for the redesign.

#/r/OnePiece Banner contest for the redesign!

As you might know, in the old version of reddit, we have a banner, that changes every so often (The next one is soon as well), but for the redesign, we don't really have one, other than the current map background we have (Mobile users have the Strawhats as a children).

So, it's due time more attention is put toward the redesign! And a contest for the banner of this subreddit will be opened soon. (do not submit them in this thread)
Just as a warning, this banner has an optimal size of 4000x128, so please respect this size (at the very least you will need to respect the 128px height). The one Piece Logo isn‚Äôt to be put on the banner.",106,1583731303,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffptha/one_piece_400000_subscribers_celebration_results/,OnePiece,1
ffpsci,Vinsmokeclan,Has this community done theories on what potential fights the monster trio would have?,"I'm very rarely active here which is why I've never come across potential match ups maybe and also about bounties which I'd think would make an interesting speculation. 

Imo the Monster trio would finally follow the previous patterns of fighting the 3 strongest opposite numbers. So Kaido would fight Luffy and King&amp; Queen vs Zoro and Sanji. But my issue is that neither of these matchup makes sense especially Luffy and Sanji and we've just not seen Zoro taken to brink. On one hand, with just 3 maybe 4 arcs remaining, they should be able to take on Yonkos and YCs but on the hand they just don't seem strong enough to win against these legends. WANO is set around the supporting characters so heavily that they probably will have fights too. So who'll fight the Scabbards and Drake and Hawkins (hell flip) etc. If Oda goes to team fights vs YCs, then it'd just be very lame for me who was so hyped before to finally see Sanji get a proper opponent and a clean W.


Also, it would get only bigger after this arc with BB's crew and The Marines. The power ups, time limit etc all makes sense for 1v1 big fight but their levels just don't.",2,1583731129,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffpsci/has_this_community_done_theories_on_what/,OnePiece,1
ffpm10,menokami,Yokai and possible DF user,"After the recent chapter we find out that Kyoshiro is none other than Denjiro and was the witching hour boy all along but i think there's another hint we are missing. 

After doing a little research I came to learn of a famous yokai known as the Onryo. 

https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/10-supernatural-creatures-from-japan/

Sources say that they are vengeful spirits that return to the world of the living to exact their revenge. They‚Äôre usually shown as having long, unkempt hair and bluish skin.

Although Kyoshiro may not have blue skin, he has the hair. So what if Denjiro is also an ability user? 

Oda has used multiple famous yokai and depicted them as fishmen, DF users, SMILE users. It could explain Denjiros ability to transform. This ability would only be possible by becoming consumed with rage.

This ability could also influence his nightly profession as the Witching Hour Boy. He could be able to frighten and escape from the many different police groups.

ffpilw,Tribesstorm,The Declaration of the Seven Queens,"It is the twilight hour of the Straw Hat Pirates. Up against the full might of the World Government, Luffy and his comrades are cornered into an unwinnable position. Outnumbered and outmatched, each member fought on much longer and more valiantly than the world could have ever imagined. But alas, there is no escape, no hope, only certain defeat. The fall of the Strawhat pirates draws near, and with their demise, the end of a dream, the end of an era. The last page in the last chapter in the history of the Great Age of Pirates.

Over the open horizon, a flag is spotted. A Jolly Roger waving in open defiance. Behind the flag, a woman. Behind the woman a ship. And behind her ship, more ships. An Armanda fades into view, filling up the entire horizon. Perched on the helm of the first ship, the woman is identified as none other than the recently crowned Queen Nefetari Vivi of Alabasta, with the full might of a nation on her sailing on her heels. As the approach nears, it becomes apparent that there not one Armanda, but seven. Each led by in a similar manner a queen of equal renown. Among them, the Empress Boa Hancock of Amazon Lily with the might of Kuja warriors. Queen Shirahoshi of Fishman Island, with an escort of sea kings, her loyal brothers, and the and the new Fishman pirates. Queen Viola of Dressrosa and Rebecca her warrior niece leading the renowned fighters of the Corrida Coliseum, Queen Mansherry of Green Bit and her warrior king Leo of the Tontatta Pirates. Queen Vinsmoke Reiju of the Germa Kingdom, and her brothers forming the Germa 66 the world's foremost technological power. And finally, Lady Hyori of Wano Country and her samurai retainers, the leader of the world's newest naval power sailing for the first time in 800 years.

Starting with Queen Nefetari Vivi, each queen raises her fist in solidarity, revealing an ‚ÄúX‚Äù on her wrist. Seven Queens, and seven ‚ÄúX‚Äùs. Each flying a Jolly Roger representing the pride of their nation. Each Pirate Queen declaring their allegiance to Monkey D Luffy, their King ‚Äì invoking a title that has not seen use since the age of Gol D Roger himself (and perhaps even longer, much longer - as historians will later argue that Roger‚Äôs bid was premature, a hopeful honorific for a sign that has yet to come. What is known, however, is that from this moment on, later dubbed the ‚ÄòDeclaration of the Seven Queens‚Äô Monkey D Luffy will be known as the King of the Pirates and true heir to the Will of D). This declaration rallies the combined forces of the Seven Queens to the aid to Straw Hat Pirates. At this moment, history will turn on its axis, a reversal of fortune of a magnitude unseen in 800 years. The battle will rage on for another seven days, but history will tell us that the war was one in this one defining moment.

In the next seven days, forces will arrive from the world over in support of the new Pirate King. Some of which, were old allies met in the nascent days of the Straw Hats‚Äô adventure. Others yet, from faraway lands ‚Äîstrangers who have only heard of the exploits and fame of Straw Hat Luffy. For seven days, an endless symphony of Jolly Rogers streaming into the battle under to fight in solidarity under the banner of freedom. In the end, the outcome was inevitable ‚Äì against the favor of the World Government. With each of the subsequent seven days seeing more nations capitulate to the will of their people and the new spirit of the age. By the seventh day and the final fall of the World Government, more than half the world has risen in rebellion with at least a quarter of the Marines fighting alongside the pirates.",3,1583729652,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffpilw/the_declaration_of_the_seven_queens/,OnePiece,1

ffp1cc,SauceMeistro,Discussion of the mole (Spoilers),"There have been a few leaks so far to Orochi's side about rebellion plans. One was the reverse crescent tattoo's meaning and those who had it, another was the plans for the raid on Onigashima. 

Im fairly certain a number of people noticed that Kyoshiro (confirmed to be Denjiro) in the moment where chaos broke out in Orochi's quarters over O-Toko and Komurasaki (Hiyori)
that Kyoshiro picked up a slip that had dropped depicting the two birds and the loop at the bottom with none other than the reverse crescent tattoo. Orochi would not have necessarily known what this meant, only Kyoshiro in that room and perhaps Hiyori would have noted its meaning. Coincidentally after he picks it up, later Kaido's men start hunting down people specifically with that mark. 

How exactly they found out about the raid plans? Simple. If Kyoshiro isnt there with the crew planning all this, there is one person in that group that Kyoshiro trusts, and thats Hiyori since they know eachothers identity. This would mean that there is not one, but two traitors who communicate between both sides.

But there is a reason for it. As pointed out by someone, it was possible that the destruction of the bridges (with the exception of the ones that lead to the capitol) is a way to make Orochi think that he has the straw hats cornered when in reality, this will allow a surprise attack on the capital to take down the shogun. The storming seas may have been set by someone from Orochi's side, thinking they stopped the strawhats, but this instead cuts off Onigashima from the mainland so help cannot arrive for the flower captiol. Then, mainland Wano will be seized by the straw hats and scabbards army, so they can then head off to Onigashima to take on Big Mom and Kaido.

Side note: It seems a little weird that Orochi would announce that there is a traitor. This is either meant to divide the scabbards and strike down Toki's prophecy or he's going balls deep and announcing that he is getting info from somewhere, most likely Hiyori but Kyoshiro is not telling Orochi who it is exactly. In short, Kyoshiro tells Orochi that he is getting info from someone within the alliance.

This theory is not complete without how this would work 20 years before the present. If you have input, please share it.",12,1583727123,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffp1cc/discussion_of_the_mole_spoilers/,OnePiece,1

ffnco3,TheEvman,Toki's Character (973+),"Ok before I begin, I'm writing this post if it ends up that Toki is actually dead and that is it from her character. I still think there's a 70/30 chance that she is still alive and Oda has more in store for her character, but if he doesn't she is the worst written character in the entire series.

When I say worst, I mean not annoying/irrelevant characters that generally serve no purpose to the story as a whole such as Wapol. I mean a character that was set up or had the potential to be well-written and important, but completely failed. I am in no way saying I am a better writer than Oda, but no author is perfect, and if it turns out that Toki is dead and gone, then I think Oda messed up here.

Reasons why:

* Silhouetted characters tend to suggest that there is something to look forward to in terms of their reveal and character. For example, the Yonko when Garp mentioned them, Imu, and someone like Oden. It is reasonable to assume that everything Oda does is for a reason and that their reveal is going to shock/excite the reader. Suspense 101. It turns out that physically, she is a carbon copy of Hiyori (assuming that Toki is dead and not actually Komurasaki). Obviously she is her mother, but Momo and Oden don't look exactly the same. I think 973 proved that Hiyori is Komurasaki and Toki isn't secretly her. Also, everyone kinda suspected that she would have some ties to Wano, but it turns out she has never been there and her clothing gave us no hints about the Void century.

&amp;#x200B;

* Time travel: 2 things came to mind when I found out that Toki had the time fruit. 1 was that I was very anxious about time-travel being implemented and then having to deal with all the inconsistencies and messes that come along with it. And 2, as a lot of people guessed, Toki would be from the void century. When Toki was first introduced, both of those worries were put to rest because thank god Oda made the fruit only be able to send people to the future and not the past, and it was revealed that she was in fact from the void century. HOWEVER, wtf did that end up doing. It almost felt like she was completely brain dead. She was from the freaking VOID CENTURY. There is absolutely no point of even mentioning that if it leads to nothing and she doesn't have anything important to add. If that ends up being the case, then it would have just been better to make her from the present and then add more depth to her, because quite frankly, I didn't give a shit about her and only wanted to hear void century stuff from her. Again this is assuming that her character is dead and there won't be anything more from her, because she might be alive or have a flashback about her. I even forgot to mention all the broken things she could've accomplished with her DF, but I don't even care.

&amp;#x200B;

* She turned out to be another useless female character. The Oden flashback would have literally been the same if she were to be replaced by some random, nameless Wano girl that Oden shacked up with. She did nothing. I felt like a lot of her lines and actions seemed borderline psychopathic. Yes, it was revealed why she was acting like that, but that was the least satisfying thing I've ever heard. She wanted to keep a strong face for her family, realistic yes, boring as hell, yes. I am not saying I was one of those guys who suspected her to be the traitor, but I would have liked if she was secretly planning things and she already knew what was going to happen and she ended up being the driving force of the alliance and the eventual downfall of Orochi/Kaido. But no. SHE WASN'T EVEN THE ONE WHO FOUND OUT ABOUT SENDING PEOPLE 20 YEARS TO THE FUTURE. She has the fruit and so much mystery about her, but no, it turns out, Oden was the one to even tell her that. And then, this chapter she reveals why she jumped into the future, and again, it's so anti-climatic. She jumped through time to find someone who would pull through with her. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? Was she lonely and looking for love and it tooke 800 YEARS worth of men to find the right one? I was hoping for either, someone like Joyboy sent her to the future for a reason, or that she was running away from something and she's being chased. And I guess the latter could still be a possibility, but if it isn't then she is an awful character.

TLDR; Too much hype and build up to just make her achieve nothing. This is honestly worse than someone like Hody Jones who was just a terrible character. However, we had no expectations for Hody Jones as he wasn't even mentioned or foreshadowed. This situation with Toki would be almost as bad if someone like Dragon, Shanks, Mihawk, Blackbeard, Imu etc.. end up being useless and coming out flat. AGAIN THIS IS ASSUMING THAT HER RELEVANCE TO THE STORY IS OVER AND SHE ISN'T STILL ALIVE.

Komurasaki=Toki

After the reveal of denjiro being kyoshiro, I reread part 1 and 2 of the want arc. The one character that doesn‚Äôt sit right with me is komurasaki the oiran.

She did not have much of a purpose other than to let robin escape with otoko.

Before the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù of komurasaki, kyoshiro asked if she was ready. I presume this was to allow him to keep her safe and not be killed by orochi.

After this I do not remember hearing about komurasaki ever again.

Toki is presumably dead, but why would a mother leave her child unprotected. I think she jumped maybe a year or two into the future. Found denjiro and hiyori, and became the pinnacle of beauty. 

OR komurasaki was hiyori all along. Which would also make sense.

She wasn't afraid of weapons in the flashback, she seem pretty much confident, even carrying them. So, why does she fear them now? Could be that they hypnotized her to be on Orochi side and not use weapons? Hypnosis is possible on the one piece word.

ffl9h6,EliDZ,"Why I believe the ""Voice"" in the Poneglyph is Haki. Using real life and info from other manga to explain Haki.","Before I begin:

I've done a lot of research and a lot to say on this topic however long post haven't been received well in my time here on reddit. If you'd like to see a far more detailed analysis I do have a video you watch. [https://youtu.be/q4LccBWyD\_s](https://youtu.be/q4LccBWyD_s)

 

In this explanation I will not only reference Chi(also known as Ki and Qi) from the real life Chinese philosphy. I will also use the most famous example of Ki in manga/anime to help me understand Haki.

[I'll try and make this as short as I can. Oops it's still a long post. I hope you enjoy.](https://preview.redd.it/2tmgbhdeoil41.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ceb7b140af622e4250c1076c4c7a64662c755078)

 

Haki can be translated as Supreme Qi. Supreme is just a self explanatory adjective so we dont have to go into that. Qi is what we need to focus on. Let take a look at the Qi Encyclopedia 

&gt;The birth, aging and death of all things within Heaven and Earth, including wind, clouds, thunder, rain, water, mountains, forests, deserts, oceans, humans, animals and insects are caused by and formed out of Qi. Although energy may appear to take on many different forms, all things in nature and, in fact, all things in the universe are intrinsically woven together so that we are, quite literally, all symbiotically one with the universe through the system of Qi.  
&gt;  
&gt;[http://qi-encyclopedia.com/?article=Understanding%20the%20Concept%20of%20Qi](http://qi-encyclopedia.com/?article=Understanding%20the%20Concept%20of%20Qi)

In DBZ you have Ki, because it's concept of power is based on Qi( aka ki)

Why does One piece call it Haki instead of just Ki like in DBZ. Is just as simple wanting to give it a different name? Perhaps however I thin there is a deliberate reason.

Ki from Dragon Ball universe is unrealistic because as you and I know, you can't shoot energy blasts from your palm. I believe that the ki from One Piece is pretty much the same as the ki is described in real life. In Dragon ball realistic ki and the exaggerated Ki are one in he same, I believe OP splits it up into 2. You have just plain ol Ki like it is irl and then there is Haki, which is the supernatural version of Ki, hence why it would be known as Supreme Ki. 

Now in order to explain the role regular ki plays in OP well all we got to do is learn about what Qi is referred to IRL. 

&gt;‚ÄúQi is vibrating in constant energetic motion within all things‚Äù. 

At first glance you might think that chi could be some religious chinese mumbo jumbo, but whether you believe in the divine or spirituality and no matter what your faith is, we can all agree that everything vibrates. Even scientists will confirm this.

 So far I have quoted the Qi encyclopedia twice now and both times I uttered the words all things. This is a term you‚Äôll see quite often in one piece. Two specific terms should come to mind. The breath of all things and the voice of all things. I believe these two terms is what separates regular Ki from Haki. **Qi** literally means **breath**. When Zoro entered at state where he could hear the **breath of all things** he could hear breathing from things such as a rock which clearly isn‚Äôt a living being. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zjvqg6ed0jl41.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21a54ff7de0fb22718ea1c870324437333820a94

 So if everything has breath/ki and ki is haki, does that then mean everything has Haki? Yes it does, but before you try to wrap your head around that think about **Ki** being their **breath** and *Haki* as their *voice*.  Everything has a normal amount of Ki aka spirit aka life force thus in a sense **everything is living**.

 

https://preview.redd.it/g2ird9pb0jl41.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04c787ab1474e47f3d5fe013df86453c7b8723b3

In order to talk you must use your voice. In order to use your voice you must breathe. Preferably exhaling. However loud the ‚Äú*voice*‚Äù is will determine how much *Haki* it has. Once again using rocks as an example, they are inanimate objects with not much of a will or consciousness as a result rocks would have an almost unhearable voice thus would have negligible haki, but just enough that you can still hear it‚Äôs breathing. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pqk5ymxqzil41.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe8b0c2ed6b1bbe699566f59ee4cbeee4e4ac810

A tree is a plant. You might hear more than just breathing. You can hear a heartbeat as well. A tree would have much more detectable haki than a rock. A snake is an animal, obviously more lively than a tree thus you can expect it to have a much louder voice which also means more haki. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6gfdb9jzil41.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7431c34e4fe8c753702478ab7adcc67623421b5c

Humans have the most powerful voice of all thus the most powerful Haki. Now let‚Äôs actually apply this knowledge to make a little theory. Ok so piggy backing off of my cursed blade theory in which I imply that there is haki imbued in the blade from the blacksmith that gives it a presence. I will now propose that it is haki imbued within the poneglyphs left by their original creators that leave voices for Roger to hear using the technique known as the Voice of all things. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/utskb4v7zil41.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=109a880b779acc32be23fb4c2f97b99458d8b270

Ok that so that explains everything the supernatural elements of One Piece. Sike you can‚Äôt talk about the supernatural of One Piece without talking about Devil Fruits. Also I didn‚Äôt even really talk about the 3 different types of Haki abilities.  This is just the beginning. Chi vibrates at various frequencies producing a range of results. I will use this knowledge to explain and predict the full potential of oh Haki. 

P.S. I actually already made the next analysis/theory, but that's gonna take longer to turn into a reddit post. I'll probably have to split it up. If you wanna check it out [https://youtu.be/ln35uhG2\_78](https://youtu.be/ln35uhG2_78)

ffkwjl,Freshairkaboom,[Theory] Luffy and Shanks are going to have a serious fight to the death,"I've seen some people speculate that at one point, Luffy will have challenged all the Yonko to a fight and come out alive. I've also seen many people say that Shanks and Luffy's fight will be of the Davy Back variety, because why else would a filler-feeling arc like Long Ring Long Land be in the manga?

The ground for that hypothesis is that Shanks and Luffy respect and love one another, so obviously, they would have no reason to be enemies, or try to fight each other with full strength. However, my theory is that Luffy **will** have a reason to hate Shanks, either by the time they meet, or after they have met. The reason is simple: He let Ace die on purpose.

Think about it. Who is Shanks? We see him attempting to stop Ace from chasing Blackbeard by talking to Whitebeard, something that does not go well for Shanks, and eventually leads to Ace being captured by the marines and war breaking out. Was Shanks there as a favour to Luffy, to save his brother? Or maybe it was to keep the fragile balance between the powers of the world? I'm putting my belli on the latter.

When Ace got captured and was scheduled to be executed, Whitebeard of course went straight to plan A: war. This is what Shanks was trying to prevent all along. Once it was inevitable though, what did he do? He stopped Kaido from escalating the situation even further, and then he went straight to Marineford to end the war. However, it was not in time to save Whitebeard or Ace. That's what we are lead to believe right? 

Well, I think what we don't know, is that Shanks actually was in time to watch the events of Luffy climbing the scaffold where Ace was chained unfold, but he chose to wait. Why? Because he needed to give the Marines a win, in order for the conflict to remain a one battle event, and not escalate into a full blown across the seas war between the Whitebeard pirates and Marines. Do you think the marines would've just given up and gone home when Ace escaped? Not likely. That would've been their greatest shame, to let the son of the pirate king escape them.

So, he could in fact have saved Ace from Akainu, but chose not to. This parallells who Shanks is, because he chose to save Koby before anything else, he was instantly there for him. When we get it revealed to us that Shanks was watching the events unfold, the gravity of the choice to save Koby and not Ace will reveal to us Shanks' true nature. That of an intermediator, a peacekeeper. All the actions Shanks have taken so far in the story, lines up with this. He does not get mad when someone spills sake all over him and insults him, he fights for those he cares about.

Now, you may argue that Ace should be someone he cares about, because it's Luffy's sworn brother, and he loves Luffy like a son. However, Shanks also knows that a lot of innocent people would get killed if he intervened against Akainu when he punched Ace. It would reflect really badly on him to be so selfish as to save one pirate when his image in the world government, and the reason he has Sengoku's respect, is because he's made it clear throughout his career that his goal is peacekeeping. Saving Ace would not lead to peace, and therefore he chose not to save him.

When Luffy learns this, he's going to instantly feel extremely betrayed, and lash out on Shanks, leading to their first and probably only real fight to the death. And once it's done, I think Luffy's going to grow up a bit and learn that there are more important things in the world than fighting only for those you care about, and that Shanks is a good guy after all. This is what will lead him into using the One Piece for the betterment of all people, not just himself and his nakama.",26,1583708576,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffkwjl/theory_luffy_and_shanks_are_going_to_have_a/,OnePiece,1

ffkh9t,HermanManly,How does Kin'emon not have the same fruit as Catarina Devon?," Kitsune are known for a few things:   

\#1 obviously, their 9 tails as 9-tailed fox (9 shadows?) 

\#2 they can control and conjure fire 

\#3 they can DISGUISE/ TRANSFORM *BY PLACING AN OBJECT ON THEIR HEADS* \- this is what we've seen of Kin'emons power so far

His name is literally FOXFIRE Kin'emon. He has the traditional ""Kitsune"" eye makeup that you can also see in Naruto for example.

&amp;#x200B;

Now there are multiple options if this is anything meaningful:   

\#1 Kin'emon could have the Kitsune fruit without realizing or not wanting to/ not being able to use it to its full potential but due to his absence for 20 years it was reincarnated and Catarina Devon came into its possession, so now there are 2 of them thanks to time-travel shenanigans. 

\#2 The ""splitting"" of devilfruit powers is much more important to the story than we think. It is kinda odd that we have seen 3 powers capable of disguising now, each seemingly being a lesser version of the higher ""ranking"" Mythical Zoan Kitsune, as well as the Katakuri fight being centered around ""anything you can do I can do better"".  

\#3 it's nothing and Oda just thought it would be funny to give Kin'emon a useless ability and he can for some reason conjure and cut flames (I think in chapter 973 he summons flames, right? Or does there just happen to be fire around him when he gets his blades?)   


  
Why would Oda make a fruit, no - an entire character based on a specific mythos and then also add that mythos itself as a fruit?  


Interestingly, Catarina Devon is also known as The **Crescent Moon** Hunter and her [first design](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/7/7a/Early_Devon.png/revision/latest?cb=20110301115239) looks to be a very pretty woman who is wearing a Wano/ Kunoichi dress.  
She could even have been using her fruit to hide her appearance all this time.  


We have also seen Komurasaki wearing a Kitsune mask to hide her face while playing shamisen.  


The biggest phallacy with this ENTIRE thing is obviously that the Vivre Cards confirmed his fruits name as the cloth-cloth fruit.   


Does anyone know of a case where Vivre Cards were used in a way as to not spoil something? This would be a huge reveal and they obviously wouldn't put it in the vivre cards, but if there is no precedent then idk.   


It's just strange to me to design an entire character around the fruit of another character lol

ffjs7h,YellowFlash384,The traitor [spoilers maybe?],"To start with, Oda planted this way back in Punk Hazard when Luffy agreed to an alliance with Law. Robin mentioned that pirate alliances are usually filled with betrayals. 

(Worth noting where did she read that though, there have to have been enough instances for her to know that, perhaps she knew that from the time she spent with the Revolutionary Army).

Next, begins the war against Kaido, with the destruction of Punk Hazard, leading them to Doflamingo, eliminating him from the food chain, and then looping in Big Mom, to eventually have two Yonko in Wano teaming up like their old crewmate days. 

The traitor must be someone within this massive alliance, which leaves all kinds of suspects. But with the recent chapters, we can conclude that the traitor is from Wano, since someone betrayed Oden when he fought against Kaido. 

For Oda to have planted a theory like this from Punk Hazard, it becomes natural that the traitor is someone of a lot of presence and has been important in the story. 

Combining the facts that there was a traitor 20 years ago, and still is there today, leaves only one conclusion: the traitor is a Scabbard. 

Carrot wasn‚Äôt alive during Oden‚Äôs battle. 

Shinobu? Well, he betrayal would have ended when she revealed the truth to Wano‚Äôs citizens back then, and she would have apologized and told the Straw Hats directly if she had finally switched to the good side. She didn‚Äôt. If a character had such a change of heart, or could no longer bear to see Oden getting boiled alive, in a fit of which she told the truth, her betrayal days ended there, and she would have come clean. She hasn‚Äôt, and that means she is not the traitor. Back then, and even in the present. 

Now to the Scabbards. 

I‚Äôll split this into two parts: those who jumped ahead in time, and those who didn‚Äôt. 

Kinemon: Jumped ahead, and we can discard him being the traitor. He had ample chances to kill Momo. 

Momo: Need I even say anything. 

Kikunojo: Remained in Wano to gather intel after the time leap. When the others decided to go to Zou, did she carry their Vivre cards in order to track them down? Did she perhaps give Jack Raizo‚Äôs card? She is a suspect at the moment. 

Kanjuro: The painter who sacrificed himself so that Kinemon could escape and find Momo. Their ship to Zou got wrecked and that‚Äôs how they all separated. He hid within walls and using his DF he created food for survival when needed. He is also a suspect. Although he did offer to commit harakiri, and Kinemon told him to not, it is still fishy. 

Raizo: After the shipwreck, how did Raizo end up at Zou? We have seen that it is nearly impossible to just ‚Äúcome across‚Äù Zou, unless you have a vivre card or something. But he did, and he hid there, waiting for Kinemon, Momo and Kanjuro to reach Zou. Perhaps he met Inu and Neko who provided shelter. 

Now the ones who didn‚Äôt leap:

Ashura Doji: Stayed back to fight a Number I think, along with Denjiro. He lost his impatient friends who blindly attacked Onigashima ten years after Oden‚Äôs death. His mentality changed and he reverted to being a thief and bandit. If he was the traitor, he knew he would have to wait for 20 years anyway, and he would have whiled away in leisure. He consistently denies joining Kaido too. I think we can discard him. 

Nekomamushi and Inuarashi: Once the best of friends, now they keep arguing. Recent chapter shows Neko asking Inu if he was the traitor after all. This can lead to two things: Neko has genuine doubts, or is blaming Inu first to avoid suspicion. 

On the other hand, Inu never justifies anything or retaliates on that. Never. Which is again a mystery. 

What happened to these two during the 20 years is hard to say without more reveals. It is also possible that these two are the traitors together, not by choice but rather are forced to be traitors. 

Did Kaido threaten to level Zou and Zunisha? Is that why they are being kept in line? If Zunisha dies and Zou sinks, so does the Road Poneglyph, and the road to Raftel will be gone forever. 

Are they keeping on to the faith that the 20 year prophecy will come true? Is that why they hid Raizo in the secret room? So that they had a fair moral decision of saving both Raizo and the Pnoeglyph together? At that time, both mattered to them, and they fucking stepped up. They even said to kill them if Raizo was found on Zou. The only reason Jack left Zou after this was because he had reason to believe this outrageous proposition. 

Jack thought that these two wouldn‚Äôt offer their lives for naught, and left. The tears they showed were real, but the threat of Kaido levelling the Minks still remained. 

Perhaps against that big threat, they leaked info? Remember that Minks haven‚Äôt had much reason to trust humans, apart from exceptional ones like Oden. These two may be caught in a very bad place, and that makes them the current day traitors. And perhaps even back then when Oden fought Kaido?

Kanjuro and Kiku are still suspect btw.

ffiqtt,Rizarealm,Theory: How did Zoro survive Luffy's pain? Also Zoro's potential,"The general consensus is that Zoro had superhuman levels of willpower and I'm not opposing this fact.

Zoro states that that was the 2nd time he felt that sensation, the 1st time was vs. Mihawk. So Zoro confirms that he can only activate haki near death. The only other time he was near death was Thriller Bark taking on Luffy's pain.   


During the time skip under Mihawk's training , he got better at using his haki without needing to be near death. He potentially can or is trying to unlock future sight. Mihawk alias used to be ""Clairvoyant"" possibly hinting at his level of Observation Haki. Zoro could be looking out of one eye to boost his haki.

ffida1,courtepy,"Looking for theories on the Moon phases, the World Government and Pirates","Hello /r/onepiece,

I've had this theory for quite a long time now. In a few words:

* When combined together, the logo of the World Government and a Jolly Roger represent the orbital positions of the Moon when it goes around the world.
* The logo of the World Government represents the new moon, the first quarter, the full moon and the last quarter.
* A Jolly Roger represents the waxing crescent (shaped like a D or C), waxing gibbous, waning gibbous and waning crescent moons (shaped like a C or D).
* The crescent moon and the D clan/will are linked.
* **C**elestial **D**ragons.
* The Road Poneglyphs are not revealing straightforward coordinates, but instead 4 specific positions of the moon.

Anyway, I was wondering if there was already some popular write-ups on it somewhere and you could direct me to them. I've tried a few keywords but it didn't lead to anything relevant. Yet.

Thanks a lot!",4,1583698580,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffida1/looking_for_theories_on_the_moon_phases_the_world/,OnePiece,1
ffibo3,Phrix_Phrox,On the Nature of Souls in One Piece,"One Piece takes inspiration from a vast amount of cultures and real-world history. In line with this, I think that the way souls work in One Piece is lifted or at least inspired by Japanese and Egyptian concepts in particular. This would be fitting considering Wano and Alabasta, the One Piece equivalents to Japan and Egypt respectively, seem to have the closest ties to the Ancient Kingdom and to the overarching plot.

Much of Japan‚Äôs culture has been heavily influenced by Shintoism, an animistic religion. For brevity, animism is the belief that natural objects also have souls. Shintoism in particular takes this a bit further in that their belief is that everything has a soul residing in it. This applies to natural phenomena, historical heroes, qualities like growth, etc. 

This is something we‚Äôve seen in both explicit and nuanced examples throughout the story of One Piece thus far. For explicit examples, there are the Klabautermann. They are described as essentially the incarnation of a well-cared for ship. For more nuanced examples, we have swords. Zoro treats swords as if they were people by calling the Sandai Kitetsu a ‚Äúproblem child‚Äù, he gave Yubashiri a funeral after the events of Thriller Bark, and on Wano he commands Enma to give back the Haki it was siphoning from him.

This leads into Wano and the secret behind how inanimate objects can ‚Äúeat‚Äù Devil Fruits. In Wano, Tenguyama Hitetsu has a teapot named Bunbuku. Bunbuku is a teapot that ate the Mythical Zoan Inu-Inu no mi, Model: Tanuki. The process of inanimate objects ‚Äúeating‚Äù Devil Fruits was thought to be a discovery of Vegapunk‚Äôs, so why is one on Wano and in Tenguyama‚Äôs care? I think it‚Äôs possible that the process of animating objects with Devil Fruits is something that originated on Wano, or at the very least that Vegapunk made his discovery of the process independent from Wano‚Äôs discovery of it. This is also the 4th (canon) Inanimate Devil Fruit User and is yet again a Zoan User.

Why is this important? It lets us see that even though inanimate objects seem to have some sort of will, they can‚Äôt act on their own without the agency an animate body provides. This is why, I think, that the inanimate Devil Fruit Users so far have all been Zoan Users. And this, in turn, gives a hint as to why Pacifistas needed to be Cyborgs instead of full-on robots. They could likely gain the powers of Paramecia and Logia Fruits, but without the agency of a biological body they might not be capable of using their powers, hence why Pacifista‚Äôs had to have biological functions.

The influence of Egypt‚Äôs culture on how souls work has to do with the different aspects of a person‚Äôs being. There are 9 aspects to one‚Äôs being: ·∫ñt (physical body), s‚Äô·∏• (spiritual body), jb (heart), k‚Äô (double), b‚Äô (personality), swt (shadow), shm (form), rn (name), ‚Äòh (death/light).

Ht is the physical form that has to exist for the soul to have intelligence. The physical body also needs to be preserved so that the spiritual body can be judged in the Underworld. This relates to objects needing a Zoan Fruit in order to have a physical body that allows for autonomy.

S‚Äôh is the spiritual form that is judged in the afterlife. The spiritual body is what can interact with the other entities residing in the afterlife. This relates to how Brook‚Äôs powers interact with both Gecko Moria‚Äôs Shadows &amp; Zombies as well as Big Mom‚Äôs Homies. Brook was able to purify Moria‚Äôs Zombies without the need of salt and was also the first person to ever harm Prometheus.

Jb is the heart in both the physical and metaphorical sense. The heart was believed to be the seat of emotion, thought, will, and intention. This relates to the Op-Op and the Personality Transplant Surgery. When Law used this move on Punk Hazard, he used Room and poked the ‚Äúhearts‚Äù out of the fleeing Straw Hats and used shambles to switch them around. They kept their personalities, their thoughts, their wills, but the bodies were different than what they were used to. 

K‚Äô is the vital essence that is the distinguishing feature between a living person and a dead one. It is the equivalent to the concept of spirit that appears in other religions, mythos, and stories. There are many things that this one in particular could relate to, but I firmly believe it relates to Devil Fruits themselves. When the Devil Fruit cycle was explained on Dressrosa, it was explained that the Devil Fruit leaves the body once the user dies and finds a new fruit to incarnate into. For the concept of k‚Äô, death occurs when k‚Äô leaves the body. I feel it important to note that k‚Äô was often represented as a second image of the king and was often translated as double early on. Oda is a fan of puns and wordplay, so the connection between ‚Äúdevil‚Äù fruits being represented in a way similar to souls and ‚Äúdouble‚Äù being a translation of the concept of soul is too good of a connection for me to pass up. Also the fact that it is represented by a second image of a king, with kings playing important roles in the story and themes of One Piece.

B‚Äô is the personality and is responsible for the uniqueness of an individual. This also applies to inanimate objects. B‚Äô is also sometimes shown as a bird with a human head. This relates to Big Mom‚Äôs Soul-Soul Fruit as her Homies are usually plants, animals, or inanimate objects that gain human-like characteristics like faces, personalities, speech, etc.

Swt is the shadow and is believed to contain something of the person it represents. Things like the status of people in power were often referred to as shadows. This relates fairly obviously to Moria‚Äôs Shadow-Shadow Fruit. The zombies created using shadows usually have faint traits from the owner of the original shadow, but are missing the complete package.

Shm is mysterious. There is little information on it and it is described as many different concepts like life-force and power but I want to focus on a very interpretation of shm. That being shm as a place in the Underworld in which Horus and Osiris dwell. There is a mysterious, as-of-yet unexplained power in One Piece that we‚Äôve seen multiple times that this could possibly relate to. Zoro‚Äôs Hiryu: Kaen, Luffy‚Äôs Red Hawk, Brook‚Äôs Soul Solid, McGuy‚Äôs Lightning Sword, and Kin‚Äôemon‚Äôs Firefox Style all allow the user to channel some elemental power into their attack. The reason I think this relates to the concept of shm is because, when Brook explains how he coats Soul Solid with his soul, he describes it as calling forth the ‚Äúchills of the Underworld.‚Äù

Rn is the name and was considered a part of the soul. As long as the name was still spoken and spread around, the soul was considered still alive. It‚Äôs their identity, their experiences, their memories. This relates to many different things. There is Gol D. Roger who promised Rayleigh he ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt die‚Äù before he was executed and started the Great Age of Pirates. The name of the Ancient Kingdom is feared by the World Government as seen on Ohara where Clover was killed for trying to say its name. Sugar, a member of the Trebol‚Äôs Army (with ‚Äútrebol‚Äù being Spanish for ‚Äúclover‚Äù, coincidentally) uses her Hobby-Hobby Fruit to erase the identity of the victim in the sense that no one will remember them, their name, or anything they‚Äôve done.

‚ÄòH is representative of the deceased and is associated with thought. There were also rites that could be performed that were believed to reanimate the ‚Äòh and turn the ‚Äòh into a roaming dead. This relates to Brook‚Äôs Revive-Revive Fruit as he is essentially a corpse that has been reanimated in the most realized sense of the word so far in the story.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, why is any of this important to the story of One Piece? If this is true and souls in One Piece work in these ways, then it might very well be integral to explaining many of the mysteries in the story. This might even be part of Vegapunk‚Äôs inevitable explanation of what Devil Fruits really are.",0,1583698417,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ffibo3/on_the_nature_of_souls_in_one_piece/,OnePiece,1

Personally, i believe that ending this arc with Orochi getting away would be very, very disappointing. I mean, we saw 20 years of murders, a country dying, and most of all, Oden. Oda let us love his family, and would be very disappointing if this arc will end in a peaceful way. The people of Wano suffered for 20 years, while the one who was sent in the future, saw this tragedy a few month ago. I think it would be  an inconsistent choice if they let Orochi go. I would be satisfied if momo or her sister finishes Kaido, and one of the scabbers(after this chap, Kyoshiro) finishes Orochi.

Every category out of 10

Categories: (each will be a number)
- 1: Content; Is there generally good One Piece-related content in the opening? Does it look smooth?
- 2: Relevance: Now it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs bad to include characters that aren‚Äôt for THAT arc, but if it SPOILS certain characters and where, that‚Äôs a problem...
- 3: Aesthetics: Is it neatly paced? Does it look good? Is it enticing?
- 4: Song: This is purely opinion, but I can‚Äôt say any of the songs are below a 7 or 8, so in the end the overall ratings should make sense.

So, here we go.

Op 1 - ‚ÄúWe Are!‚Äù
C: 9
R: 8
A: 8
S: 9
I love this opening so much. It begins One Piece as we know it, and coming back to this song almost made me cry. It‚Äôs not going to be perfect of course, but let‚Äôs face it: we all have deep connection to the roots of our One Piece journey. Nami, please do NOT hit me with that staff.

Op 2 - ‚ÄúBelieve‚Äù
C: 7
R: 7
A: 7
S: 8
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúbad‚Äù, but it feels redundant throughout. We love our fellow East Blue Nakama, but the visuals and the content together just feel the same throughout. We love the Straw Hats but there‚Äôs no outstanding details. Nothing too enticing about it. At least the Eurobeat is nostalgic.

Op 3 - ‚ÄúHikari E‚Äù
C: 10
R: 5
A: 8
S: 9.5
I love this opening so much, and I‚Äôm gonna say that about a lot more so bear with me. Even though this opening doesn‚Äôt necessarily relate to Alabasta and it spoils Robin, the song and visuals tie so well together. The way Roger talks about freedom, the fun on the Going Merry... this opening screams what the Straw Hats are all about, and it warms my heart. 

Op 4 - ‚ÄúBon Voyage‚Äù
C: 9
R: 8
A: 9
S: 9
‚ÄúBON VOOYAAAGE!!‚Äù I prefer Male Vocals overall (it‚Äôs not sexist that‚Äôs just how I am) but damn, the voice kicks a**.  Idk why, but emphasizing Robin with the heel click part is my favorite detail in this whole opening. For some reason that touched me so much. We also get Luffy narrating the beginning, which is nothing short of amazing. Ok, I‚Äôm changing the Aesthetics to 9 from 8 (not 10 because Nami‚Äôs butt was uncalled for lol.)

Op 5 - ‚ÄúKokoro no Chizu‚Äù
C: 10
R: 9
A: 10
S: 8.5
Holy sh*t, I like this opening a lot more than when I was in the middle of Water 7. This opening is all about Water 7 and the Straw Hats, and there‚Äôs even small details of Kaku, Kalifa, and Lucci that make them look ever so slightly sketchy (actually there was a detail of Lucci fighting Paulie oof) that I did NOT notice when I was watching this arc. However there were other brief details like Luffy Vs. Usopp where I was like WOAHWOHWOAH, THE F***?!? This didn‚Äôt spoil Franky as a Straw Hat though. But because those spoiler details were very brief yet really manifest what Water 7 was, it compensates the relevance to a solid 9. I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm saying more and more about each opening, but it only makes sense. (Actually I say less about the eh ones, but the openings get better in general)

Op 6 - ‚ÄúBrand New World‚Äù
C: 9
R: 10
A: 9
S: 9
START ME UP. This opening is so hype. At first we have what seems to be a good ol opening. Got the ocean, straw hats are chillin, and Luffy makes a ‚ÄúHmmm?‚Äù frown when the navy appears (lol I love that). But then, it transitions into Enies Lobby with the Straw Hats each standing and facing up at Robin. I wish there was more time saved for Enies Lobby content in this opening, but for what was displayed, it was epic. The ‚ÄúStart Me Up!‚Äù On Luffy‚Äôs gear 2nd, Robin shocked that the Straw Hats showed up, the fighting. Overall this opening gets a very high rating.

Op 7 - ‚ÄúWe Are! - Straw Hat Version‚Äù
C: 9
R: 7
A: 8
S: 7
It‚Äôs not like this opening is supposed to be ‚ÄúGood‚Äù, but I must be a proper critic. Since it‚Äôs the regular ‚ÄúWe Are! animation, that gives immediate points, but the singing... no hate but it ain‚Äôt my cup a‚Äô tea. Also, I WANTED TO HEAR ZORO SING. Oh well. Maybe soon enough lmao.

Op 8 - ‚ÄúCrazy Rainbow Star‚Äù
C: 8.5
R: 8
A: 9
S: 9
This opening is moderate. There‚Äôs fun details of the Straw Hats, and it shows some characters like Mihawk, Ace, and Shanks which is the big Epic. I like the beginning the most because I like the beginning of the song, and I like the scattered ‚ÄúONE PIECE‚Äù letters, and the fact that it starts before dawn. Lots of these opening don‚Äôt seem to be precise for their arc, but I like what they did with this one anyways.

Op 9 - ‚ÄúJungle P‚Äù
C: 8.5
R: 9
A: 8
S: 8
Sorry for those who really love this opening. It doesn‚Äôt really fit for me for some reason. (Ik that sounds weird bc nothing is below an 8, but One Piece openings aren‚Äôt bad in general). Anyways, like ‚ÄúBelieve‚Äù, it just seems redundant and I lose track of what‚Äôs happening in the opening. Showing Brook and Sanji and Zoro fighting is what I like the most about this opening. Bc of these two things, relevance gets the most points out of the categories. This would be higher if I liked the song more, but oh well. Everyone has opinions, sooo

Op 10 - ‚ÄúWe Are!  (Grand Line) - TVXQ‚Äù
C: 10
R: 9
A: 10
S: 10
I don‚Äôt see this masterpiece get as much praise as it deserves. TVXQ is wonderful for one, and the content and aesthetics are just beautiful. I‚Äôm gonna list. Luffy‚Äôs huge smile, them running with the characters they‚Äôve seen CHRONOLOGICALLY in the background, showing a bunch of important characters and scenes (Ace VS BB, Shanks, WG elders, Doffy, Sengoku, etc.). It also shows what the Straw Hats are (the X marked fists for Vivi, Going Merry; shows they are nakama at heart). What can I say. Go rewatch this opening, and you won‚Äôt be able to deny that this opening is the epitome of the One Piece world itself. Sure it could‚Äôve shown more thriller bark stuff, but this opening was meant to be an anniversary as well, so you can‚Äôt blame it. However I prefer this by many, many margins over a regular opening for Thriller Bark. I love everything about what we received instead. (still would like to see what a TB op would look like). Ok. I‚Äôve said a crap ton. Just, please do as I said and rewatch this opening. Contemplate the details. Let everything about it seep into your mind.

Op 11 - ‚ÄúShare the World‚Äù
C: 10
R: 10
A: 10
S: 10
The perfect opening doesn‚Äôt exi-
Well, after 11 openings, it does. The chronology is perfect, the visuals are perfect, the effects are perfect, Boa Hancock is perfect, Luffy‚Äôs derp stare into Boa Hancock‚Äôs eyes is perfect, ETC. This opening is on point with the transition to the darker themes and storyline. The colorless background as the crew gets destroyed by Kuma, the crew together as they ‚Äúshare the one dream‚Äù, Impel Down, etc. Don‚Äôt forget the song is by TVXQ (they‚Äôre great aren‚Äôt they). But actually though, the song feels different for a One Piece opening, which I REALLY appreciate. Like opening 10, go rewatch this. It is sheer brilliance, and I don‚Äôt want to say any more before you rewatch it. I don‚Äôt want to hinder how amazing it is. I‚Äôm going to rewatch this for the third time as I‚Äôve been typing this response.

Op 12: - ‚ÄúKaze wo Sagashite‚Äù
C: 10
R: 10
A: 9
S: 8.5
Idk if any of you don‚Äôt realize this, but the whole beginning of this opening is Luffy‚Äôs imagination. This is what he wants back, and the theme of this is that reality is changing too fast for him to realize. The song even sounds happy, and the fact that it doesn‚Äôt sound fitting with Ace about to get executed, just brilliant. That‚Äôs where the extra .5 came from. The visuals are pretty nice too. A great representation of the dark themes of One Piece for sure, and I love how the focus is more metaphorical than direct, which was incorporated into the visuals and the song. Love it.

Op 13 - ‚ÄúOne Day‚Äù
C: 10
R: 10
A: 9
S: 10
SAAAA YUKOUUUUUU!!!
Oh, how greatly this represents the darker themes just like the last opening. This really gave me the chills (no, not because a lot of the opening shows Luffy on ice lol). Just Luffy running for Ace, the lyrics talking about moving forward AND IN THE BEGINNING REFERRING DIRECTLY TO LUFFY‚ÄôS BACKSTORY, oh my god, it doesn‚Äôt get better. The Aesthetics fell short of a 10 for me not because of Luffy running for Ace, that was the good part. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúlist-like‚Äù feeling of showing individual characters and a brief spec of their power. Actually, the characters felt ‚Äúlisted‚Äù in general, but Luffy running for Ace and smiling once he gets to him makes the Aesthetics a 9 overall.  PS: Whitebeard is f**king epic.

Op 14 - ‚ÄúFight Together‚Äù
C: 10
R: 9.5
A: 10
S: 9
I feel like a lot of people find this opening to be one of if not the very top, and honestly I can see why. It‚Äôs the transition of Luffy out of his darkness. You got Ace pushing Luffy towards the Straw Hat, the ASL pirates, the Crew looking strong and ready to come back; it‚Äôs all building to the hype. We‚Äôll get to that very shortly, and by that I mean the very next opening. The Song isn‚Äôt my fave fave, but you can‚Äôt shoot me down for that, for I have the ‚ÄúI have my own opinion‚Äù armor. Relevance was a 9.5 and not 10 because while this did very accurately represent the transition out of darkness, I wanted more ASL stuff. Dadan? Garp maybe? Ace not liking Luffy at first and then appreciating him? Gray Terminal? It could be difficult to get that all into one opening, but I felt that could‚Äôve been possible. Good opening nonetheless. Let‚Äôs get to pure hype now.

Op 15 - ‚ÄúWe Go!‚Äù
C: 9
R: 10
A: 9
S: 10
How wonderful. The Straw Hats are back in action, and stronger than ever. Everyone‚Äôs gathered their emotions, and everyone‚Äôs for real now about what they went out to sea for. SO HYPE!!! The song is amazing too. It feels like a ‚ÄúWe Are!‚Äù, and it fits the fresh start concept of the opening. The visuals are pretty good, but the only thing I wish they did was start the opening with the appearance of the Straw Hats at Sabaody. That would‚Äôve probably made this a perfect opening like opening 11. Otherwise, this made me smile and feel so much motivation. The One Piece isn‚Äôt far from their reach, they‚Äôre ready for the New World. Let‚Äôs go.

Op 16 - ‚ÄúHands Up!‚Äù
C: 9.9999
R: 10
A: 10
S: 9.5
This opening is very near perfect. I love the song, I love how the drawing at first colors itself in, I love Trafalgar D. Water Law (no homo). Honestly there‚Äôs not much more you can say about PH arc besides what‚Äôs in this opening, after all, it‚Äôs an opening, not a summary. (C is 9.9999 bc no Aokiji and Akainu lmao). The song is so heart warming, which is kind of ironic considering this arc, but I still love it and how it connects with the visuals. Punk Hazard can‚Äôt be dire because these legends trained for two years. Caesar the New World Clown can‚Äôt stop the Straw Hats, not a chance. Oh don‚Äôt forget Law. Also don‚Äôt forget Law. Ok, I‚Äôll stop there lol.

Op 17 - ‚ÄúWake Up!‚Äù

Very catchy song and amazing details in this opening. Cool matchups and the Blackbeard interruption, lotta interesting things going on here. (That interruption gave me jojo vibes tho). Dressrosa, being the biggest arc to date currently, has a lot to pack in it, but I feel like some more of it should‚Äôve been included because again, this opening is for the first half of it. However, this opening is still pretty damn epic, and you get your good ol‚Äô Straw Hat fun.

Op 18 - ‚ÄúHard Knock Days‚Äù

I love the scenery of this opening, and I love the song as well. The song is about wanting more action, and that seems to be what the visuals give us as well. Sure, it‚Äôs about the Straw Hats and it shows some Dressrosa stuff but.. ...... where‚Äôs Doflamingo?? He‚Äôs my favorite villain in the series, and they show only one detail of him punching at Luffy? Are you kidding me? There‚Äôs WAY more to Doffy than THAT. They also coulda shown more fight scenes against the Donquixote family. It doesn‚Äôt make the opening a train wreck, but for the relevance section, it sure does.

Really catchy song. The visuals all look great as well, and as for how relevant it is, Zou isn‚Äôt hard to summarize, so the opening did its job. The only thing I thought was weird was the water gun scene. I like it because Sanji and Zoro lol but it felt so sudden in the opening. You went from the Yonko, Shichibukai, and Worst Generation to water guns. Like bruh. Besides that, there was a small detail of Sanji being afraid of something and Nami, Chopper, and Brook getting kicked out of Bege, which was necessary. Plus the lyrics of the song were pretty hype. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen the end of the world with my own eyes‚Äù was the first sentence. Pretty sick imo.

Op 20 - ‚ÄúHope‚Äù

God, this opening is outstanding. The female vocals actually get a 10 for me. The song is great. The scenery is beyond epic as well. The instrumental part with Katakuri and Smoothie, all shadowy-looking with the glowing eyes... just epic. I just wish there was interaction with Luffy and Sanji in the opening because that would really emphasize Luffy‚Äôs purpose and desires in this arc, so content got a point off there. Besides that, pretty good representation of the beginning of Whole Cake.

The song is repetitive yes, but it‚Äôs also extremely catchy and there are good vocals. For the opening itself, it included everything that was needed for a second half of WCI opening. Because it‚Äôs a newer opening, the details were on point. I loved the part of Carrot and Pedro, then Carrot‚Äôs eye appears over the screen and shows her going Sulong. That‚Äôs just epic. However, though it was one of the most obnoxious things about the arc itself, Big Mom and ‚ÄúKAAAAAY-KEEEEEEE‚Äù had to be included to some extent. However, a scene of CHOPPER against the Yonko woman... I LOVE IT!!!! Yes, Chopper‚Äôs got supa powas!!!

Bruh. CHAPTER 973 WAS SPOILED HERE!!! It was showing the Scabbards, and Ashura and... Kyoshiro were shown??? And Luffy in prison? It didn‚Äôt show Kawamatsu tho. Still though the spoilers here are even more absurd than op 18. That‚Äôs kinda a rip. However, the visuals, effects, animation, and content in general were absolutely outstanding. I‚Äôm starting to think Toei believes no one is an anime only anymore, so they‚Äôre going all out with the openings. Maybe they‚Äôre right, or at least ALL U ANIME ONLY‚ÄôS NEED TO READ THE MANGA. But hey, they don‚Äôt have the right to force that, so they should care about what they put in OOOONNNNNEEEE opening.

What do you guys think? Don‚Äôt disagree with me unless you have very recently rewatched an opening, but I‚Äôll take opinions that are against mine. I‚Äôll also take people who agree with my opinions. Just share ideas.

fffuf5,WhimsicalGrin,"With the flashback over (most likely), it is possible to confirm the identity of the [SPOILERS]","Yes, this is indeed a post about the identity of the traitor, which I know some people are extremely tired of. All the findings are not my own, and in cases where they aren't, I will be simply be stating such as I'm in a bit of a hurry to write this down. As I can't possibly read all posts, and started looking through old chapters today, some of the findings that are my own may not be the first of their kind. With that out of the way, I am now certain that Kanjuro is indeed the traitor. This post can be regarded as a rough summary of everything pointing to this. As I'm writing this in a kind of hurry and doing this on my phone, feel free to link your former posts regarding the subject.

What has been stated before among other things, is that Kanjuro is the only person capable of relaying information fast enough for the actions of the traitor to line up. As has been pointed out in other posts, Kanjuro can be seen sending birds in ch. 920 when Kinemon and company arrive in the future. As has also been stated before, the information Kanjuro had by the time of the scabbards' arrival at the port in ch 958 matched up with what Orochi recieved (4000 troops vs. 4200 troops which Kinemon, Kikunojo etc. had knowledge of). The only thing that I haven't seen before (correct me if I'm wrong), even though I assume it indeed been noticed, is the information regarding the northern graveyard in the last page of ch 955. I personally believe this could be referring to the location of Yasuie's corpse, as the second to the last page in the same chapter, a monument to Yasuie can be seen having been raised next to a monument to Pedro. It is not a grave per se for the reason that there is no body for either of them. As can be seen in ch 951, Kanjuro was however given the body of Yasuie by the people of Ebisu town, while promising them that a funeral would be held in Kuri. No such funeral was shown, which points to the conclusion that Kanjuro hid the body of Yasuie some other place.

The information above is not complete. There is more information, such as Kanjuro being the most cowardly of the scabbards (instantly yielding when he first met Oden, hiding in Dressrosa the entire time until Kinemon found him). I believe this is of relevance regarding that he is the most likely person to submit before Kaido and Orochi. As some may remember, Hawkins revealed to Law in ch 954 that you basically have to submit instantly to Kaido if you want to survive. Kid and Killer were exceptions, because they fought until they collapsed. The same thing happened with Luffy. The other scabbards would likely keep fighting should they be caught, but Kanjuro might very well submit. Other than this, there is remarkably little backstory to Kanjuro, and during the raid in ch 970, you don't see him fighting at all.

Now, regarding the execution, another user posted a couple of days ago that Kanjuro could have created a clone of himself. Kanjuro is the only person capable of doing this among the scabbards. There is however more proof of the fact that this is likely a clone. If you look at ch 971-972 , there is only one person among the scabbards that does not have a spoken line of dialogue, which is Kanjuro. Neko and Inu fight, Ashura is pissed when Orochi changes the method, Raizo tells Oden that Oden's dream is their dream etc. Kanjuro is shown with his mouth open, but he only makes a sound when he thinks back on his time with Oden. It is likely that Kanjuro's paintings are unable to speak sentences or use words, but can use sounds as shown before. In the newly released ch 973, we can see the same thing happen. Kanjuro is seen doing one thing, and one thing only, which is to run. In fact, while everybody else at one point or another stops, looks back or stays behind, Kanjuro just runs forward until he is ahead of Kawamatsu, Kikunojo, Raizo and finally Kinemon, which can be seem in the final panel of them fleeing. When Kinemon, Raizo and Kanjuro bust through the doors of the burning castle, Kanjuro is seen talking again. More than likely, he has switched himself out with his clone at this point in order to travel forward in time.

Considering that the flashback is almost over and we have confirmation that Denjiro is indeed Kyoshiro (actual confirmation in the manga), it is possible to expect that at least one of the scabbards knows without a doubt that a scabbard has been leaking information. Because of this, the reveal will likely happen soon which is why I wanted to make one post of my own and be a part of the discussions.

I also noticed that there are people who do believe that Kaido only said that there was a spy to cause discord and some people believe that Law is the traitor, or that Kyoshiro relayed the information to Orochi. These could be valid points, if it wasn't for the fact the information that Orochi received could only have come from a scabbard. Kawamatsu only told the scabbards and Momonosuke of the fact that Hiyori was indeed alive. The fact that Orochi knew that they had 4000 troops is not something that either Kyoshiro or Law could possibly have known. Kinemon states that Law has indeed not been in contact with him in ch 955, which makes Law's possible information way too inaccurate compared to what came to the knowledge of Orochi. Law is the red herring in this scenario. Lastly, Kaido was indeed prepared for the arrival of the scabbards 20 years ago, my point being that him being prepared was impossible without an informant. 

For the people that doubt the existence of a traitor, my recommendation would be to primarily read ch 955-959 again. The information that only the scabbards had, came to the ears of Orochi, which I think Oda makes a very specific point. Other than that, credit to the other people whose posts have preceeded mine.",47,1583688836,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fffuf5/with_the_flashback_over_most_likely_it_is/,OnePiece,1
fffuep,ProjectUsser,Moon tattoo definition revealed! Kozuki clan purpose,"In chapter 926 we saw Usopp giving letter with secret plan to samurais who had Waning Crescent moon tattoo on ankle.

 

[Waning Crescent Tattoo on Ankle](https://preview.redd.it/dzjyw41cchl41.jpg?width=228&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7dae56bdb629fad8841ce6fde7a5014c2d0d84e)

I always thought that it was due some Kozuki family connections to the moon. Even Oden had moon mark on his clothes. 

[Oden Clothes with Waxing Crescent](https://preview.redd.it/5bvdl2lqchl41.png?width=207&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6eafa001ff748fdf017ef36ff595c632b48bcc70)

However it was another phase of the moon ( Waxing Crescent ), which is also attributable for nine scabbards coats or kimonos.

Until Chapter 973 it was a secret, but now we know that lady Toko have made a prophecy. 

 

[Waning Moon in the Day of prophecy](https://preview.redd.it/e1fxq1s7fhl41.jpg?width=826&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0011e4098f745669509c192edeeca41adfa84f0)

Lady  Toko made a prophecy that moon would fulfill its purpose and it shall know the brilliance of the Dawn ( Viz Version ). 

People who lost their belief in Kozuki clan are afraid to get a divine punishment. They talk about an eternal night.  

Only after Lady Toko's words and that faithful night people started to believe in her words and in purpose of kozuki clan. Only after this episode they covered parts of their body with Waning Crescent which became a mark for Revenge. 

https://preview.redd.it/bkx6kz65hhl41.jpg?width=184&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0380c0d88d55d40491eed60f9b3fad63c72fdca2

As far as i know, Waxing Crescent is the phase which happens only after new moon. New Moon is a phase where it can't be seen. Moon is totally disappeared from the sky, because it is located between earth and sun. 

https://preview.redd.it/hmotfki8hhl41.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7bcc92b54deb297b2823066b294402eb93e36cb

&amp;#x200B;

Waning Crescent is a period where people are looking for the new Dawn !

New Moon is a Dawn ! ( Solar Eclipse could also Happen in New Moon period ) 

Waxing Crescent is the world which have seen a Dawn! 

People who are looking for the Dawn and who believed in Toko's words are marked with a Waning Crescent. 

While Kozuki Clan are the ones who wear a sign of the freed world which have witnessed a Dawn of the World.

But I feel like luffys awakening could end up like gentle criminals super power. Anything he touches (even air) gains elasticity/rubber. He wouldn't need gear 4th to fly around, and it makes perfect sense in every way. This might also make a good comparison to katakuri who can make mochi out of thin air. Luffy couldn't make rubber appendages, but what if he rubberised the air around him into invisible fists like an elfen lied character?

So, we have been told that while sea water zaps the strength of the devil fruit user, it doesn't nullify the fruit powers completely. Thus why all of these instances happened i.e a fruit user while cannot swim in water can use his powers in the sea 

Now compared to that we have

&amp;#x200B;

My question is why at some times we have people using their devil fruits inside the sea , albeit with difficulty and other times totally useless and they get nullified. Shouldn't a logia simply tune intangible and escape from sea stone cuffs by the logic Oda has made for sea stone cuffs ( have same properties as sea)

If Luffy and others powers can be used in the sea for a short time, then escaping from kairoseki for logias and others should be easy.

ff9mq8,CanadianJudo,(spoilers all) Its a red herring.,"for month we have been hearing whispers of a Traitor who is it, first the secret message was found out, then the second one too.

but I will list why I think there is no traitor its a red herring, a double agent.

first this week we learn what happened to Denjiro and thinking about what he said ""don't even reveal my identity to our allies till the moment of the great battle"" got me thinking.

we know Denjiro is a Mafia boss and money lender (controlling gamble houses, etc)

we know Denjiro is the ""Right"" hand man of Orochi.

so look at the Traitor, first Kin message was cracked and leaked and all his supporters were rounded up in the capital.

then the second message was cracked and leaked, all the bridges and Port where burned but those connect to the capital and the Port in the Capital.

this would be perfect for Orochi the capital is the sole region of Wano under his direct control. Kuri is controlled by Jack, Udon is controlled by Queen.

so the rebel are forced into the capital smart but with Orochi who command the capital. Kyoshiro he control the money and we know Orochi has no loyality from the people they follow him out of fear and for personal gain.

so what will happen when Momo walk into the capital with his Scabbard the last living son of Oden the true heir to the Shogun. Kyoshiro will switch sides.

Kin'emon is likely thinking they are marching to their death but they will be welcomed as heroes.",7,1583654876,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ff9mq8/spoilers_all_its_a_red_herring/,OnePiece,1

ff9m38,TheCaptPanda,"Theory on the Numbers (Kaido's army, potential spoilers)","Theory: Kaido's numbers were at one point Moria's crew

My theory is based on a few things. 

1) Moria's explanation of the fate of his crew from chapter 481

""Even if I had allowed you to continue peacefully on your voyage... At this level, death would have been all you would have found. You're nowhere near ready for the new world. Though it would appear you have gathered yourself quite a fine crew, you would only loss it all!!! Do you understand why that is? My subordinates... They were famed far and wide... Why did I have to lose them all.........? !!! My nakama were lost precisely because they were still alive. If they had all been zombies dead right from the start, I would have lost nothing!!! For zombies are invulnerable!! Eternal warriors; even if they are purified, a replacement can be found!!!

At no point has it been stated that his crew actually died. We know that they were once quite strong too. 

2) Sometime between when Oden returned to Wano and when he stopped dancing, Kaido gained enough strength to overcome Oden's resistance. 

The only event mentioned during that time would have been Moria arriving on Wano with his crew. 

So my theory is that when Kaido defeated Moria, Moria's crew turned on Moria and sided with Kaido. Moria's depression was due to being betrayed not due to mourning their deaths. Perhaps even he wanted to take down Kaido to win his crew back but I dunno.",24,1583654749,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ff9m38/theory_on_the_numbers_kaidos_army_potential/,OnePiece,1

Romance Dawn Arc:
It was ok but captain Morgan and Alvie's weren't threatening and it was great to see how zoro joins the crew this arc wasn't that big as it is the first arc of the series I give it a 7/10 

Orange Town Arc:
This arc was pretty good I liked it more then romance dawn and it was pretty fun it's cool to see the original trio battling against buggys crew and seeing nami unofficially joining the crew (then betraying them) I give this arc a 8/10 still buggy wasn't threatening and yes this is a fact that this is the best arc because the future pirate king buggy makes and appearance so that's that 

Syrup Village Arc:
I loved this arc a lot and it's also where usopp became one of my faviroute characters and captain kuro was a great villain seeing his plan kinda working out but it back fired but kuro was threatening and his fighting style was pretty sick I loved this arc a lot as a kid and also now I give it a solid 8.5/10

Baratie Arc:
This arc was pretty meh for me it started out good I liked it but as it goes on the more meh and boring it becomes don kreig is one of the worst villains I just disliked him and it just felt pretty boring imo it just went too slow the don kreig fight was so many episodes yes sanji was a great character but this arc was just meh imo sanjis backstory was great so I give it a 4/10 this is just my opinion if you love baratie that's great 

Arlong Park Arc:
This is the best arc in east blue and will be one of my faviroute arcs of all time like seriously I loved this arc a lot finding the truth nami was part of the arlong crew because of them making a deal for 100 mil berries so she can get her village back and Namis back story was really good was pretty dark tho seeing her mother in rent of her eyes but this is the first time arlong was threatening I give this arc a 9/10 

Logue Town Arc:
Anouther great arc smoker became oof my faviroute marines because he is one of those marines who don't keep on saying that they are strong and important and everyone should not mess with them and seeing the return of the future pirate king buggy was cool too and also a guy who saved luffy don't know he is but I am sure it's a big spoiler so yeah I give this arc a 8.9/10",25,1583650692,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ff905y/my_thoughts_on_the_east_blue_saga/,OnePiece,1

I think Kyoshiro cut Komurasaki/Hyori with the ability to cut nothing.

ff8s0d,gregory280,Why people believe in the Luffy x Nami ship?!? Can‚Äôt understand at all...,"First of all, how anyone can possible see couples in one piece ?? I mean, We had recently Sanji and Pudding, but that is the far normal ‚Äúromance‚Äù couple in the series (related to the main cast). 

There is Boa Hancock and Luffy which makes far more sense to begin with...but I can see they as couples too. I think it‚Äôs more sense to see their relationship as something that one piece was lacking on the shounen genres which is the character which has a thing for the protagonist. And boa Hancock is 29 years old...so it‚Äôs kind hard to see she with luffy at the end of the series (anyone in fact).

I discovered that there is a bunch of Luffy and nami fanfic and people arguing, logically, believing with all their might, that Luffy and Nami has a thing between them. They used Arlong park arc as a excuse for they arguments, but I can‚Äôt nothing more than a comrad feeling between them there (or any other moments in the series)

ff8jfj,HighLaugh,A plan kept hidden...,"Following contains spoilers for the latest ch, ch 973.




Now that it's FINALLY confirmed that Denjiro is in fact Kyoshiro, and that he's also the ox 3 boy(admittedly I thought the ox3 boy was Izo lol), I think that it may be safe to theorise that Law could be colluding with Kyoshiro's plan instead of Kinemon's traitor prone plans.


With Law being held prisoner in the capital, it could be possible that Kyoshiro could have visited Law out of curiosity. Knowing how cunning Kyoshiro is, and given Law's shrewd nature, it's not farfetched that Law and Kyoshiro could have gone on to click &amp; plot something together. When you think about it, it's also a smart move for Law, especially since he now knows that any ""plan"" you share with the Straw Hats will NEVER go according to the ""plan"".


I prefer Law working with Kyoshiro rather than him working with Drake. 
I think that whatever Drake is in Wano for, is more paramount to him than some 20 year rebellion plan. I feel that Drake releasing Law could just be him trying to kill two birds with one stone.

ff6x4x,letsgomina,[ Theory ] The 20 Year Master Plan :- The Traitors Of Wano...,".... are Denjiro and Kozuki Hiyori. 

**DENJIRO‚ÄôS 20 YEAR MASTER PLAN**

To get this out of the way, I think there were 2 traitors involved. First one, was 20 years ago. I think **Kurozumi Higurashi was the spy 20 years ago.** There was no other way she could‚Äôve gotten close enough to Momonosuke to touch his face to change to him. If she can get close enough to touch Momonosuke, she could‚Äôve very well gotten close to know of the Scabbards‚Äô ambush. 

*The Zou Factor*

* 20 years ago, Kozuki Oden tells the scabbards that when the time is right, they had to visit Zou, and it was the place to go. I think this is significant.

Kyoushiro knows of this too. So when he gets the news of the scabbards‚Äô return, he knows that they‚Äôre definitely going to Zou. To help Jack go to Zou, I think he gave Jack Nekomamushi/ Inuarashi‚Äôs Vivre Card. Why not Kinemon‚Äôs or Kanjuro‚Äôs or Raizo‚Äôs ? He couldn‚Äôt make Vivre cards of them. They time-leaped before he could make it. He only has Nekomamushi, Inuarashi and Ashura Douji‚Äôs Vivre card. But this is all part of Denjiro‚Äôs plan.

*Hiyori‚Äôs Role*

During the alliance gathering to discuss the time and place of their attack, Hiyori was present. She learns of all the plans of the alliance and she tells Denjiro everything. Denjiro tells Orochi of these plans *selectively* , gaining his trust more than ever. 

*The Master Stroke*

By gaining the trust of Orochi, he has made sure that he gains control of the entire Flower Capital, and by extension, the entirety of Wano to an extent. Now he will be able to gather all of the alliance in one place, and also make Orochi think that he‚Äôs beaten the alliance even before the rebellion. But in reality, the alliance is now stronger than ever, and Orochi won‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre coming. 

Denjiro has been waiting for 20 years for the scabbards to return, while protecting Hiyori and gaining an immense trust from his along the way. He actively tried to sabotage the alliance‚Äôs plans only because he had even more incredible plan in mind. 

Hiyori revealed her identity to the alliance, so that they would trust her and give her all the information she needed, she gives these information to Denjiro who passes it on to Orochi, and gains immense trust. 

Denjiro And Hiyori has this planned for 20 years. He is going to save the rebellion when they funnel into the flower capital as per Orochi‚Äôs plan, and then lead the rebellion to Onigashima where the war is going to take place when Orochi least expects it.",62,1583639006,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ff6x4x/theory_the_20_year_master_plan_the_traitors_of/,OnePiece,1

ff5miw,ahood34,The Marine‚Äôs goal at Marineford,"Everybody knows the Marines defeated the WB pirates. I recently heard someone say their victory is obvious because they achieved their primary objective of killing Ace. 

But was killing Ace their primary objective, or was killing the next Pirate King and ending the great pirate era their objective? From Sengoku‚Äôs execution speech, it is clear that the Marines just assumed Ace was the heir to Roger based on his lineage alone. However, they were clearly wrong, as Ace‚Äôs goal was not to be Pirate King, it was just to find a place where he felt welcomed, valued, and loved despite his ‚Äúdemon‚Äôs blood.‚Äù  He found that on the Moby Dick. 

So at Marineford, if their goal was to kill the next Pirate King, they failed that objective when WB hit Akainu and destroyed Marineford, creating that chasm that allowed Luffy to be saved and escape. 
And if their goal was to end the pirate era, they failed that objective when WB announced the One Piece exists. 

I‚Äôm not saying the WB Pirates won the war, I‚Äôm just saying I don‚Äôt think the Marines achieved their primary objectives. I think WB saving Luffy and reigniting the pirate era is why he was able to die with his pirate pride intact despite the loss. 

The only one who achieved their primary objective there, in my opinion, was Blackbeard.

I know there might be the possibility that the king of this ""kingdom"" might be more of a philosophical idea of a king and not an actual king, but I would argue, that seeing this kingdom as a real kingdom like Alabasta or similar would contradict the whole idea of being a pirate and living free in a sense a pirate would understand it.",9,1583632893,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ff5lza/why_the_ancient_kingdom_cant_be_a_pirate_kingdom/,OnePiece,1

ff5gyl,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 14: Boodle,"The chapter starts off with some more great Buggy humor. Even though the joke works better if you‚Äôre Japanese, I still found it really funny. I like that Oda is taking the time to show Buggy messing around, mostly because villains are my favorite part of manga. We cut back to the villagers, and start to learn a bit more about Boodle. Again, I appreciate Oda going out of his way to make this town more than a set piece for Luffy and Buggy‚Äôs fighting. People here have history and their own motives and aspirations, which is something I can really appreciate. We get a short but nice exchange between Luffy and Nami. It does seem like Nami definitely has something she‚Äôs hiding judging by her face, but it seems like Luffy doesn‚Äôt care, at least at the moment, so we probably won‚Äôt be getting details on that until at least this arc is finished. 

&amp;nbsp;

So now we get Boodles speech, which I really liked for a couple reasons. So first of all, the callback to Romance Dawn with the whole ‚Äúthere are fights you can‚Äôt back down from‚Äù was really nice. It does make me think that Boodle will probably end up getting his ass handed to him, it would do good for Luffys development as a character by seeing the consequences of entering a fight when you don‚Äôt need to. But this is Luffy we‚Äôre talking about, he‚Äôs very emotionally driven so it might do nothing. We get to see more history on the town, I really like this whole segment, and the ending with Buggy obliterating part of the village really made me understand where Boodle was coming from. Also Zoro just straight up tanks the explosion which is crazy. Boodles ‚ÄúI Know it‚Äôs reckless‚Äù was really powerful, and overall it was a great moment. You can really sympathize with how his life‚Äôs work is getting destroyed in front of him, which is why even though I know ‚Äúhe‚Äôs reckless‚Äù if I was in his position I would do the same. Also, You can tell Luffy sees his younger self in Boodle, especially because of the fact that he says ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let him die.‚Äù I also like how Boodle says the town is his treasure, incorporating the whole theme of personal treasures very well. We get Luffy asking Nami to be in her crew, which she denies. I think Nami will end up joining the crew at some point during this arc, or soon after it. Or she could end up being a one time thing like Coby, but I really doubt it with the way she‚Äôs been set up. We end off the chapter with Zoro saying they‚Äôve done more damage to his name than his stomach, which is a really cool line. 

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah I really liked this chapter, and this whole arc has been really nice so far. I like the theme of personal treasure, and the town feels much more alive than in most other series. I definitely think Boodle is getting his ass whupped next chapter.",12,1583632242,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ff5gyl/one_piece_journey_chapter_14_boodle/,OnePiece,1

ff4qn3,The_Meow_Lord,Just thought I'd share a theory/idea.,"Theory; One piece is in a post-WW3 era earth that transgressed back to the pirate era.

TL;DR: OP is set after a WW3 type event and went back to the piracy era, but retained some pre-war ideas/technological aesthetics and capabilities.

I was watching one piece and just like everyone else, I noticed a lot of things that seemed ""advanced"" by pirate era standards. The reason is that OP is set in an era after a nuclear war/WW3.

Sure there are pirates, and a navy, and other things that would fit in perfectly.

But, a lot of navy personnel wear very modern looking suits, a lot of characters wear ""modern"" clothes, like Nami and her tank top, Zoro wearing regular T-Shirts, etc. Although I am aware a lot of characters wear pirate-y looking clothes.

Technology too. Ships in the navy have cannons, that rather than being ""cannons on a ship"", follow the             ""guns in a turret"" of battleships of WW1/WW2. The pistols/rifles as well, they look like flintlock weapons, but they have been shown firing multiple times without reload, suggesting multiple rounds in the gun.

The devil fruits? Created by the fallout. Giants and otherwise really tall humans? Radioactivity/fallout.

The nukes destroying the earth is also why it's now just a bunch of islands on a massive ocean.

ff32gx,BeeTheKing,Theory about Joyboy and the Ancient Kingdom (first timer here),"Hello guys, I'm Bee.  
There is a lotta things I wanted to share with yall, but I was too shy for Reddit tho.

But its time to do something new, so here comes my theory:

The ancient **Great Kingdom** was a pirate kingdom. With a ""tiny"" land with countless ships mooring around it. Ok so not that tiny land, but the most important part is the countless ships around it.  
The **nation of pirates...** but not pirates like Doffy, Kaido or any villain pirate out there.   
They were pirates like Luffy and his friends.  
They were not robbing or killing innocent people, they were just living freely. And they did nothing bad at all.  
**Members of the D. clan** were leading the kingdom, they were the royal family.  
As it was said before the kingdom was really advanced, they allied with many other nations out there. I would say they were like allied everyone...and even married to other royal family members...  
It was an utopian kingdom...  
And the will of D was always a simple thing: Living freely, **being the most free person of the sea.**  
The whole kingdom was living this lifestyle.  
But.... someone of the D clan thought it differently. A certain important member of the D clan (probably was close to Joyboy, maybe his little brother or something),   
felt differently what ""living free"" means. He thought he can do anything he wants. He became something like **Celestial Dragons** nowadays..  
And soon he got followers who was thinking the same. Maybe the followers were in the D clan, maybe not. But doesnt matter, they were thinking so differently and they did many wrong actions...   
It **escalated quickly,** they started rebelling...then war broke out soon...  
At that time **Joyboy** was the king of the **Great Kingdom.**  


The huge war during the **Void Century** basically was between the members of D clan and their followers.  
Joyboy was too kind-hearted, he was so emotional that he couldnt demolish his enemies, probably bc his main enemy was a close family member to him... He couldnt go as tough as he could against it, and he was losing...He became dissappointed about how things turned out... and he slowly let them win...  


He wasnt strong (emotionally) enough to defeat his rebelling D clan members.. So he decided to write a message of the true story what happened back in his time. He sent a message to someone who will carry his burden. Someone who will carry his will. His good friend helped him to create the **Poneglyphs.** (ancestor of **Kozukis**)  
The rebelled members of the D clan (and their followers) made the World Government later, and their descandants are the Celestial Dragons now.   
And about **Im-sama**, he could be a lineage descendant of the main rebel member of the D clan  
OR simply he is the guy who started the rebellion back then. There is many option how could he still alive.  
Toki could sent him into the current timeline. Or Ope Ope no mi eternal youth operation... or simply a new type of DF...  


And since it was a kingdom of pirates. There was no main race there. Even the members of D clan consisted of many races. Joyboy could be a giant.  And if he was a giant then we saw his **strawhat** at  **Mary Geoise.**  
Otherwise the strawhat was made by Joyboy to gift it to the mermaid princess... Bc he simply made a same strawhat to his new friend... :)  
And because of the rebellion, Joyboy couldnt fulfill his promise he made to the mermaid princess, **Poseidon.**   


And about **Blackbear D.** and also **Rocks D. Xebec.** They both went through the same thinking as the rebel member of the D. clan, even if they related them or not...  


So now **Luffy** who fully inherited Joyboy's will, the true meaning of the will of D-s have to defeat the remnant/descendant of the rebel members, **Im-sama, Celestial Dragons, WG** .. everything.  
And also the new rebel member of the D clan, **Blackbeard** himself...",9,1583621520,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ff32gx/theory_about_joyboy_and_the_ancient_kingdom_first/,OnePiece,1

Reminds me a lot of Yu Yu Hakusho in that way.

So many frisson inducing moments. So many goosebumps. I loved when Luffy, Sanji, Usop, and Zorro went to Arlong Park to take down Arlong. Them walking together was so fucking badass.

The villains are all unique and different. I really liked that Buggy and Elvita showed up in the last couple of episodes. It was a cool way to bookend things with them being the first villains at the beginning of the show.

The Dragon guy is interesting. I can't wait to see where that goes.

ff0u3x,downtimeredditor,"It's okay to be openly disappointed about the decision a person, you look up to, makes","For everyone wondering what the fuck I'm talking about. It's about the upcoming interview or convo between Oda and Nobahiru Watasuki. 

For those out of the loop. Nobahiru Watasuki was convicted in possession of Child pornography. Police found many CDs and DVDs on girls in their early teen years at his place. This isn't something that happened forever ago. This happened in 2017. His penalty was $1,900. 

I'm not doing a cancel culture post. I'm not a fan of cancel culture. But I am really disappointed that Oda would agree to do this. 

Rather than try to bend backwards to some how say well it's no big deal. I think we should know it's okay to say hey I'm really disappointed he made this decision. To be honest, I don't really like the culture difference defense in this either cause it's bad. I mean they have laws against in Japan too so it's not something where I'm being xenophobic. 

What I'm saying is I'm disappointed in Oda for agreeing to do this. If someone were to lose interest in Oda or One Piece due to this I get it. And it also doesn't help the fact that Oda is friends with Toriko creator who had a 2 year suspended sentence for soliciting prostitution to an underage girl. I don't view Oda any different than I did before because he's not done anything bad. In fact in back story of Zoro he promoted gender equality showing that girls can be as good as guys or even better heck there are several strong female characters. With Ivankov and Bon Clay hes forward thinking about gays and transexuals. So I don't view Oda in a negative light but I am disappointed in this decision.

fezr4g,MsHelvetica,"Regarding Princess Vivi,","I have another shitposty theory to cast to the wind. This time, it's regarding Vivi as the next Joyboy. There's really not much to support this theory except circumstantial evidence. 

The first is the conversation overheard by Roger and Oden about the meeting of the two sovereigns/kings. Vivi also fits the age range of the kings prophecized. Vivi has also been shown to be a capable diplomat and leader. During the Reverie, it was heavily implied by the picture Im chose was that of Vivi as the Light to extinguish from this world. I believe this might be due to Im believing Vivi to potentially be the next Joyboy, especially w/ her meeting Shirahoshi. 

The second is that Vivi is/was a member of the Straw Hat pirates. However, she pulled a reverse Oden and instead of leaving the country to go on an adventure w/ pirates, she chose to stay and restart her country from civil war. She has the qualities of a leader and a king by putting her ppl first.

feyodj,ImmaIvanoM,Haki and Stamina. How do they work? [Spoilers][Analysis],"Haki as stated by Rayleigh is an spirit energy of sorts found in all living things. 

This energy is manifested for combat purposes through willpower hence the name itself, ""Haki"" meaning ambition. 

We can say that improvement in haki can be attributed to Mental state,  such as Luffy and Zoro awakening haki in times of distress pre time skip or training in the use of specific haki such as was the point of the time skip.

What we shall investigate is the other way of improving haki that's been implied from the start, and that is actual physical training of one's body to increase ones STAMINA. 

This has been implied in more obvious ways such as Luffy and company undergoing physical training when improving their haki durig the time skip. This has also come up as one of the reasons Luffy is left lacking in Stamina when he reaches his limit in Gear fourth. Gear fourth having been stated to consume too much haki by Rayleigh, Doflamingo and  Hyogoro. 

The instance when Haki being connected to stamina was basically outright stated as a fact is when Luffy says he can't use Haki because of the sea prism stone cuffs he has on. This is confirmation to a degree since the only effect ever stated sea prism has on devil fruit users is draining their stamina and Luffy's words essentially correlate draining stamina to inability to use haki.

Therefore as it stands, since physical stamina is required to use haki, physical training to improve stamina also improves haki usage. 

With this conclusion set, what we need to investigate is what the actual relationship between Stamina and haki is.

First we can say the reason these two are even connected to begin with is the initial definition of haki. Haki dwells within living things and Stamina/vitality are associated with life itself and at times are substituted as Life energy in stories.

The second thing we could look at is a disparity between the two. Giants like Harjudin could be considered to have more stamina than a regular human such as Zoro given their body sizes and yet Zoro could be considered to have more Haki given his combat achievements with Haki. This therefore means more stamina doesn't indicate more haki and vice versa at least from one individual to another. This is likely due to the other factors that improve haki I mentioned before such as mental state and training in haki itself. 

Lastly we can conclude that usage of Haki drains stamina which is built up by physical training but the rate of usage of this haki requires training in haki to begin with and the actual amount used at a time is regulated by ones mental state such as how strong ones will to win is. 

Concurrently, physical training to improve one's base Stamina is always a good thing but training to improve one's stamina RECOVERY is also a viable alternative. Since the point is to have stamina, having a lot of base stamina or having high recovery of stamina both achieve similar effects with regards to use of Haki and better yet having both is the most ideal.

TL; DR

Physical stamina is required to use Haki and physical training to improve stamina also improves Haki usage. Combined with Training to use Haki and ones mental state, these are the three factors that determine ones proficiency in using haki in the series.",0,1583603724,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/feyodj/haki_and_stamina_how_do_they_work_spoilersanalysis/,OnePiece,1

fex6mc,Firas_Skywalker,Strawhat's crew is weak and incomplete,"Hi,

I don't know if you guys ever debated this but I feel like the crew (and the ship btw) still look like rookies.

Becoming the kaizoku means having the strongest crew and for now I feel like that closer one to that is actually Teach.

Luffy and Zoro are the only actual fighters in the crew and they almost never fight together in the same place or at the same time. (Zoro is always lost somewhere)

I mean, how can you beat a Yonko is Luffy is the one that has to beat everyone. We've seen a great example of it at Whole Cake island as Luffy had to deal with 2 of the strongest members of Big mom's crew and even fought her whole army.

When you compare his crew to any yonko's crew. It's a mess.

I feel like Law, Marco, Kid (and why not, Carrot) have to join the crew in order for it to be ""competitive"". 

You can't become the Kaizoku with Usop, Chopper and Nami (Robin also barely ever fights).

fevuj2,PhantomLyf3,Usopp EOS (spoilers),"Usopp's dream to be a brave warrior of the sea leads me to believe that Usopp will accomplish something huge and become one of the most feared nearing the end of the story. This is how it may happen:

During the fight in Wano, Usopp will have a very important role, and will somehow annoy Big Mom (just as Usopp pissed Doflamingo off the most during Dressrosa). Once Big Mom sees Kaido losing, she will retreat back to Whole Cake Island and gather the rest of her crew to finally take down the Strawhats - with Usopp as her first target. &lt;Fast Forward to Elbaf&gt; 

Big Mom will chase the Strawhats to Elbaf to finish their fight. Once they meet, Usopp will recognise someone on their ship. Big Mom used her resources to find people who Usopp loves - just as she blackmailed Sanji with Zeff - Big Mom will kidnap Kaya. At first, Usopp will be too scared and frustrated to do anything, but will somehow muster up the courage and take Kaya back. This would result in Usopp being gravely injured when defeating a strong enemy by himself; with Kaya being freed, she would run to Usopp and tend to him as she is learning to become a doctor for this very reason. Personally I could see Usopp vs Cracker, or Usopp vs Oven.

Well, its either this or Usopp uses Midori Boshi - Impact Wolf up Kaido's Ass.",16,1583591524,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fevuj2/usopp_eos_spoilers/,OnePiece,1

fevhpf,artymcparty,"Shanks possible Role, Spoilers from Latest Chapter"," theory time, this chapter shows Shanks  meeting Momo and Oden's family. We know Shanks intercepted Kaido in order to help Whitebeard in marineford and to prevent a bigger war perhaps. 

So put those two together, why wouldn't Luffy get Shanks as an ally against Big Mom and Kaido. After all we saw him meet with the gorosei and know the government want to stop Kaido Big Mom team up so maybe  they requested Shanks to help and in return they'll do something about Blackbeard. If Luffy was just up  against one Yonko I'd say his current forces would be believable too pull out a win with help from minks, wano people, and supernova's. But hes up against two  Yonko right now and Orochi's men who will most liekly take up some of the red scabbards attention.

 Also I know Oden didn't request help from Roger's pirates crew but if just one visited Wano or got news of Luffy protecting  Odens Family now. I'm sure at least one of them will help and it could be Shanks. After all he said he'll see Luffy soon, and plus blackbeard can show up at the end of the war as a reverse Shanks and do something dastardly to set up next arc.",9,1583589708,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fevhpf/shanks_possible_role_spoilers_from_latest_chapter/,OnePiece,1

ferbn9,delicateenergy,Whiskey Peak: Luffy vs Zoro Chapter,"I know lots of haters love to say that this fight was nothing but a gag, but you are wrong. We get lots of information from this fight. But first let me lay down the ridiculous three main reasons why people say this fight was nothing but a gag:

1. Luffy is fat
2. Luffy is out of character (I have to laugh at this one lol.)
3. Nami stops the fight by punching them.

Now listen you  uncultured readers. Any of you who used these ridiculous reasons need to learn reading comprehension. Let me explain why this fight is informative and true. I will first tackle the top 3 ridiculous reasons:

1. Luffy being fat isn't really anything, Luffy is strange, he is a man made of rubber. We know from the very beginning that his fighting style comes off as silly. Luffy being fat no way diminishes the fight, I don't see people complain about tankman, yeah it is a silly technique, yet we know as readers that Luffy and his fighting style is silly. Also side note, Luffy's fatness doesn't even last long, so even if you were to somehow disagree with the first reasons I gave you, his fatness literally lasts only until the fight gets serious. Either way, saying because he is fat during part of the fight is just laughable.
2. I like this one, but I am sorry, Luffy is not out of character. One lets get this straight Luffy is really great with people but he is still absolutely unbelievably silly/stupid. People argue that Luffy should have trusted Zoro, just how he trusted Nami didn't kill God. Here's the thing if you reread chapters 75-76, Luffy doesn't see that God is dead and is relatively calm, we know that when Luffy is calm he rather reads people better. So what is the difference between Whisky Peak and Arlong arc. Food and Proof. We know Luffy loves food, and whoever feeds Luffy automatically gets on his good side(Rebecca, even Doflamingo?). The town people were **welcoming** to Luffy and crew, they **fed** them.  Luffy was in no way suspicious of them, as food clouded his mind like it usually does. He saw the results of Zoro's actions before the reasoning, with the thought of their hospitality clouding his mind. Luffy ultimately acts in character, as the situation provided before him is between friend(feeders) and friend(Zoro) in his mind. However unlike Nami's situation, Luffy with his silliness had rather definitive proof that Zoro had done something bad to his other ""friends"", thus he wished to fight Zoro, but wait this isn't even the main reason they fought, but I will get to that later.
3. This is a fairly simple a ""gag at the end of the **fight**"", the fight(remember fights hold information) itself wan't a gag but the ending was. And it was justified, considering Luffy and Zoro had already finished their enemies(some information in the fight). Thus anything afterwards wouldn't have benefit the story.
4. Now this one will include pieces from 2 and 3. The fight is informative and a tease. We see Oda put two characters(the awesome protagonist and his badass firstmate) directly against each other , teasing the readers, who by this time in the story were undoubtedly questioning if Zoro and Luffy were equal. And we get that answer, they fought to an equal standing. However,the dialogue is the most important part of the fight, we see both Luffy and Zoro wanting to also know who is stronger, people tend to leave this part out, but it is information added to their characters. Luffy himself questioned his strength compared to his firstmate and Zoro did the same to his captain Luffy. They both stood tall against each other, and exposed underlying feelings that they were edging to expose. We also get a tease on how they would stand to each other for the rest of the story. 
5. The final ultimate reason. The chapter title is ""Luffy vs Zoro"" for a reason. Oda doesn't put out  gag chapters. Calling this fight a ""gag"" is calling the chapter a ""gag"". Saying this fight shouldn't be taken seriously, is disrespect to the chapter itself. As long as I've remembered, I don't recall Oda ever putting out a chapter that isn't informative or a chapter that shouldn't be taken seriously. Telling others that it is a gag is an insult to his work. Learn to appreciate, learn to understand.

I posted this because I notice that lots of people in this community don't respect this fight. To be honest, you don't have to like it or frankly respect it, but if you choose to not respect it, don't mislead others who are trying to understand or enjoy Oda's work. It is bummer that people allow their opinions to over write the story for everyone, and that isn't cool.",57,1583562310,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/ferbn9/whiskey_peak_luffy_vs_zoro_chapter/,OnePiece,1

One that comes to mind was in Chapter 901 where Jinbe decides to stay back with his crew to protect the Straw Hats. Luffy tells him he must survive and commands him ‚ÄúEven if you die, don‚Äôt die‚Äù

Has Death Note drawn inspiration from Odas earlier work ""God's gift for the future"" ? 

Oda drew this as a one shot manga back in 1993 and has concepts, which is later seen in Death Note. 

For instance a notebook which can be used to decided death or events on the exact moment the writer wants it to happen.

Here is a link to the description of Odas Gods gift for the future :   [https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/God%27s\_Gift\_for\_the\_Future](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/God%27s_Gift_for_the_Future)

fen7ml,GumsGang,One Piece Journey Chapter 13: Chouchous Last Stand,"The chapter starts out with Boodle and Nami being surprised that Luffy is alive. Luffy finally gives his reason for sticking around, which is to recruit Nami and get Buggy‚Äôs map. So most likely we‚Äôll get another arc after this recruiting another crew member, mostly because I can‚Äôt imagine they would sail into the pirate's graveyard with just three people. But I don‚Äôt expect to wander in East Blue too much longer if they‚Äôre getting the grand line map this arc. We cut back to Chouchou, in a scene that is way more depressing than it has any right to be. Seriously, watching a dog get slapped around as he desperately tries to defend the basically his owners entire livelihood is tough to fucking watch. 

&amp;nbsp; 

This next sequence is very important in showing Luffys character. We see that Mohji decided to burn down the store, which is a huge dick move. I feel like even though this mini arc with Chochou was only two chapters, this little scene hit me right in the emotions. Maybe that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a dog person, idk. But why is this scene important to Luffy? Because like Luffy, Chouchous treasure is something very close to him, so seeing that shop burning meant the same thing to him as seeing Shanks straw hat burning. He understands the value of the pet store to Chouchou, so when he finds Mohji, we see him genuinely pissed for the first time since Romance Dawn. It‚Äôs a really touching moment, and watching Mohji get his ass beat was immensely satisfying. Also I want to say that Gomu Gomu no Hammer looks awesome, and I like that Oda is really using the rubber power to it‚Äôs full creative potential. 

&amp;nbsp; 

We cut back to Nami and Boodle talking, in another really good character moment. Nami says that all pirates are shit people, and tries to attack Luffy when he gets back. I think whatever pirates did to Nami must have been fucked up for her to have this kind of reaction, at the same time I can‚Äôt really blame her because Mohji was a huge dick. Luffy giving the dog food was really heartwarming, and I think it shows that he‚Äôs a really great guy at heart, even if he comes off as stupid. We end the chapter with Buggy telling his crew to gather all the Buggy Balls, so he can blow the town to shit. I don‚Äôt know how Liffy is going to stop him if he actually starts firing the cannonballs, so the village might be fucked. Overall this was another good chapter, the Chouchou mini arc was surprisingly emotional, and as someone else pointed out, it makes the village feel lived in, and not just a place for Luffy and Buggy to duke it out.",5,1583541260,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/fen7ml/one_piece_journey_chapter_13_chouchous_last_stand/,OnePiece,1

femwzh,yassmine9493,Is Onepieace one of the last readable manga left??,"I've been looking at list of popular stuffs in Japan and wow they are hot mess. 

50% Another world 50% cheesy romance.

Since Onepiece is close to the end with HxH permanantly DC'ed, I think I'll be done with all this.",18,1583539948,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/femwzh/is_onepieace_one_of_the_last_readable_manga_left/,OnePiece,1

Can‚Äôt wait for next week!!",5,1583539776,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/femvqt/now_that_its_confirmed/,OnePiece,1
femtdu,MistaBobobo,What Members of the Blackbeard Pirate Are You Most Curious About?,"Blackbeard is most certainly one of the most fascinating antagonists in OP, maybe even in modern Shonen as a whole. But we can talk about him later, I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts/theories on his crew. I've been re-watching the final parts of Marineford and been pondering a lot on the Impel Down inmates that joined Teach's crew, and how they got their infamy to be put in Lv6. Or really even his og crewmates before Marineford, Teach had such a ragtag group of monsters with barely anyone knowing who they were to becoming an Emperor in less than two years! Teach has a ""no weaklings"" policy in his crew and its interesting to see how he values comrades akin to Luffy. 

Are there any members of his crew that you hope to learn more about or see in action? Personally I'm curious about Avalo and Vasco. For Avalo I'm curious about what he exactly did in his country to be deemed so corrupt he was impeached, something the OP Wiki notes is that he was the only LV6 inmate not mentioned by Ivankov when they were getting mentioned earlier, and he was allowed to wear his royal clothes in prison. Maybe he was able to pull some strings or has some inside connections, maybe a Kingpin (Marvel) situation? 

And for Vasco Shot, he's just so goddamned goofy looking and is a comical drunk so what on earth he did I'm even more curious about as well his abilities. He looks like an inmate from a Looney Tunes short character so he's kinda fascinating to me lmao. Jokes aside are there any members in BB's crew that stand out to you?",11,1583539466,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/femtdu/what_members_of_the_blackbeard_pirate_are_you/,OnePiece,1
