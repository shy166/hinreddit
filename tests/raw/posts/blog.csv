e62krf,washedupextra,Reddit in 2019,"It’s December, which means it's that time of the year to cue up the ""Imagine,"" overpromise and underdeliver on some fresh resolutions, and look back (a little early, I know) at a few of the moments that defined Reddit in 2019.

You can check out all the highlights—including a breakdown of the top posts and communities by category—in our official [2019 Year in Review blog post](https://redditblog.com/2019/12/04/reddits-2019-year-in-review/) (or read on for a quick summary below).

And stay tuned for the annual Best Of, where moderators and users from communities across the site reflect on the year and vote for the best content their communities had to offer in 2019.

In the meantime, Happy Snoo Year from all of us at Reddit HQ!

div2x2,mjmayank,Just Launched: Easily Share Reddit Posts Directly to your Snapchat Story!,"We’re excited to announce our new integration with Snapchat, which enables Reddit iOS users to seamlessly share their favorite Reddit content with friends in the Snapchat app.

**How To Share**

Redditors who have the Snapchat app installed will be able to share their favorite Reddit posts with friends in a Snap! To share Reddit content in Snapchat, redditors simply tap the “share” icon on any post on Reddit's iOS app and select the Snapchat option. Then add it to your Story so all your friends can see it or choose a few friends to send the post to.

*Processing img d6qjrfpwnys31...*

**The Experience For Viewers**

Snapchatters will see unique Reddit content in their Snaps and Snap Stories via a new sticker designed specifically for the integration, which includes Reddit logo and source information. If the Reddit mobile app is installed, the viewer can simply swipe up on the Snap to visit the original post in the Reddit mobile app. If the viewer does not have the Reddit app installed, they will be taken to the App Store to download Reddit on iOS upon swiping up on the Snap.

(Plus, announcing the winners of our in•cred•i•ble contest!)","Back in May, [we announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) an updated new feature, Custom Feeds (née ""multireddits""). This feature is a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and help newer redditors discover more communities. We also announced a community contest to see which redditors could create the best Custom Feed for a variety of categories. Today, we’re here to announce the winners and ~~give them a few scraps of Silver~~ shower them in Premium.

# First, a few highlights

Since we announced the update, we’ve already seen:

* Over **300,000 custom feeds** have been created
* Over **10,000** of you have **followed another redditor’s feed**
* The **most followed feed** has a variety of “Hold My \_\_\_” subbies and was created by u/waldrich. Naturally, it’s called [**/holdmyshit**](https://www.reddit.com/user/wardrich/m/holdmyshit/)
* The **second most followed** feed is your one-stop spot for all of the NBA teams’ subreddits. It’s succinctly named [**All NBA**](https://www.reddit.com/user/8unk/m/feed_me/) and is by u/8unk.

# Now on Android

Custom Feeds are ready to go for Android! It’s part of version 3.31, which shipped on July 15th. Android redditors: you can now create and edit your Custom Feeds, plus follow your favorite feeds. (Before this update, you could only consume existing Custom Feeds.)

Tardar Sauce, lovingly nicknamed Grumpy Cat, was more than an icon in meme culture. Grumpy Cat was a symbol of the mild annoyance that exists in each and every one of us. As part of the Reddit community for over 6 years, she will be sorely missed. 

In true Reddit fashion, Grumpy Cat is being celebrated in a number of ways in different communities—from [r/cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/bpozxa/the_iconic_grumpy_cat_has_passed_away_today/) and [r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/bppwbz/grumpy_cat_one_of_the_foundations_to_this_current/) to [Lego fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/bpqd4q/rip_grumpy_cat_you_will_sorely_be_missed/), [Minecrafters](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bppeh6/happiness_from_minecrafts_10anniversary_sadness/), and [u/Shitty\_Watercolour](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/bpq02r/rest_in_peace_grumpy_cat/).

[Creddit: u\/Shitty\_Watercolour.](https://i.redd.it/87cijjyyity21.jpg)

Grumpy Cat touched our lives and our Snoo pillows in a visit to Reddit HQ in 2015. She truly was as unimpressed by us as she seemed online. We will forever remember her sitting upon her Snoo throne, drifting off to sleep from boredom in dealing with us simple peasants.

The spirit of Grumpy Cat will live on inside each of our hearts. Every time a headphone is ripped from your ear. Every time you knock your head on an inanimate object. Every time someone talks over an important scene in *Game of Thrones*, someone tells you to “calm down,” or chews really loudly with their mouth open – Grumpy Cat is with you.  

So, on this morning that has already made the internet a much sadder, grumpier place to be, we pay tribute to the queen of cats and memes and cat memes. We invite all of you to do the same.

bm913e,youngluck,Sequence - Recapping The Fools of April,"[LEAKED 'SEQUENCE' SCREENPLAY](https://i.redd.it/mp3o9kvp71x21.png)

\------

**TL;DR**: We learned a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

A month ago we released this year’s contribution to what has become an annual tradition unlike anything else on the internet: a social experiment delivered on the day of celebration for the Fools of April. It is a day we here at Reddit anticipate all year, the day circled in our ‘Cat Facts’ calendar with a big red marker. The rest of the internet has grown accustomed to using this day to deploy light-hearted tomfoolery and, admittedly, there is a brief moment where we consider the risk-free ease of producing a quick gag gift or two... but only to know what it feels like. Those thoughts quickly return to the warmth of what we know this day to truly be on Reddit; a chance to do much more. On, it is a chance to convert part of our shared space into a playground, much like the one where we first met our beloved community. On this day, there are no teachers and very few rules, just dedicated time to run free and explore and build stuff and play games and learn about each other all over again.

The games are different every time. And whether they end in triumphant glory or with little Bobby busting his lip on the monkey bars, again… we still show up to play. We play until the sun goes down, the street lights come up, and it’s time to go home and wait for the chance to do it all again. In truth, we cherish this time not just for the experiments we play, but as a time when the limitless creativity of the Reddit community teaches us things that help us better serve them during the other 364 days of the year.

On April 1, 2019... we launched **Sequence**.

# THE EXPERIMENT

Sequence was intended to see what happens when redditors are given a tool to create a collective narrative within a traditional movie format. The idea was simple in theory, to present a series of empty slots (i.e., scenes) that users could fill with gifs or text cards and then vote on which ones they thought should end up in that scene. A timer would lock the scenes in sequential order and when all of them were locked, they’d be stitched together into a single video.

# THE BUILD

**BACKEND CHALLENGES**

[u/miamiz](https://www.reddit.com/u/miamiz) **+** [u/crxpy](https://www.reddit.com/u/crxpy)

One of our main goals was to keep the site from going down, a challenge given the limited time we had. Our solution was to try and separate as much as we could from the main service. Sequence had its own voting and image upload queues, which copied a lot of what the main queues did but kept from being clogged with massive Sequence data, so image submission processing didn’t slow down across the rest of the site.

Sequence requests were also redirected to a specific set of servers that we pre-assigned just for Sequence. The challenge was figuring out how to get the top post of each scene to show up in its intended position since all posts in a scene were stored in a separate listing and fetching 50 listings to locate one post, for one scene, was unreasonable. We ended up caching the top valid posts per scene and updating them dynamically after vote batches were processed. There was also a Cron that would update it periodically in case a previous winner was deleted or removed, along with scene lock timers flexible enough to adjust on the fly.

**FRONTEND CHALLENGES**

[u/madlee](https://www.reddit.com/u/madlee) **+** [u/theandytuba](https://www.reddit.com/u/theandytuba)

One of the biggest challenges we encountered in building the frontend for Sequence was performance – each act contained up to 50 clips, as well as up to 25 more when viewing a scene for voting on or nominating new clips. That many videos playing at the same time is enough to bog down any browser, especially mobile browsers. Trying to load and play all of the video clips at once was easily enough to overwhelm a mobile browser, often leading to many clips failing to load completely. In addition to this, some clients would not autoplay video clips without an explicit user interaction, which also broke the experience entirely.

To address these issues, we built a system to prioritize loading videos within the viewport (the part of the page that is visible) first, to pause videos when they scroll outside of the viewport, and to fall back to loading .gif versions when videos failed to autoplay. The video management system also limited the number of simultaneous video downloads to help prevent the browser from getting overwhelmed and also made sure that video playback across all clips on the stage stayed synchronized to the same 5-second loop, significantly improving performance.

**DESIGN CHALLENGES**

The biggest design challenge was delivered by the nature of the medium itself. All motion-based media formats, including Video, operate on the exact same fundamental process, whereby multiple still images are displayed in sequential order through a frame **one at a time** in rapid succession to produce the illusion of motion. That illusion is dependent on the rate of those images exceeding the human eye’s ability to distinguish them individually (10-14 frames per second), and the size of the frame they are displayed in remaining constant throughout the entirety of the sequence. This constant size must restrict viewing to a single image at a time, or the illusion is broken.

With Sequence, we were tasked with building a tool intended to support collaboration, yet it would produce and rely on content that functioned by serving individual frames. **One** frame of **one** clip from **one** contributor would own the entire communal stage at any **one** time. The speed at which frames change helped a bit, but we’d still need to consider the reality of a single contributor owning the entire narrative for the period of time their clip was the sole occupant on a stage, a stage that only afforded real estate for one. The challenge was to design an interface that could display as many other clips from other contributors vying for a scene as possible while simultaneously clearly defining which clip was leading the race to occupy it so that slots surrounding it could potentially be used to build off of its contents. To define the sequential order, each scene would be placed in its desired position on a linear stage, a model used by every video-editing software product ever. However, In a collaborative environment with multiple ideas and viewpoints yelling from all directions, this linear format presented a host of additional challenges, most notably the inability to view more than one scene’s options at a time.

In the end, it was the community’s ability to organize that would negate most of the perplexing challenges we were unable to solve with design. As the great philosopher Ian Malcolm once stoically proclaimed while wearing sunglasses in an underground laboratory, **“Life……….. uh…………………….. finds a way.”**

# THE SEQUENCING

The first commit went out on **Feb 3rd**. There were 409 commits, 13,402 lines of code, and it was 45% Python, 35% JS, 10% CSS.

True to the spirit that drives these experiments, there wasn’t a unified hypothesis of what Sequence would produce. These projects are often seeded by questions we don’t really know the answer to. We ask one, try to build something that might help answer it, ship it, and watch what users do with it. So, that’s what we did here.

When the dust settled 72 hours later, 3.1 million of you came, 2.6 million of you stayed and watched, and 590,427 of you decided which of the 67,471 nominated clips would make it into the Final Cut—a hideously beautiful, 15-minute visual hodgepodge of chaos and cohesion that one critic ([u/Gnarley\_Strarwin](https://www.reddit.com/u/Gnarley_Strarwin)) hailed is “like an escalating argument between two standup comedians getting into a drunken argument eventually yelling nonsense over one another. 10/10…”

Ladies and Gentlemen, without further ado... Let us pop some corn, grab a beverage, and pull a chair up really, really close. A little bit closer. For here, presented in a glorious half-full glass of HD...

The final edit of Sequence, set to the soundtrack of *Citizen Kane:*

# THE EPILOGUE

In its wake, more creative expression emerged. Alternate acoustic variations, including one with [meticulously sourced original audio](https://youtu.be/73Ep00-KHDI), alongside higher quality Minecraft replicas and [hand-made analog sequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/sequence/comments/b8hggb/a_small_sequence_i_made_in_my_notebook/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Somewhere along the way, the sub was repurposed to be, well, none of us really understood what the purpose of the sub ultimately evolved into, but the randomness of the submissions and the velocity of activity from users, also generally confused as to why they were there but participating anyways, was really fascinating.

However, it was the process of creation itself that would produce an equally compelling story. A tragic tale of love and hate, complete with knights, snakes, killer robots, plot holes filled with plot twists, dramatic narration, a Stan Lee cameo, and an ending that hinted at promises of redemption.

When all was said and done, those that came to play had a lot of fun. Once again, the community surprised us with creative abilities that put our wildest imaginations to shame. We sat with dropped jaws watching you use creativity not only to produce content but also to navigate and solve challenges that left some of us (just me) crying alone in a corner. So, to all of those that participated, all of those that tried, and all of those that took the opportunity to remind us that [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place) was better… thank you for joining us on the playground this year.

9sgm4l,jkohhey,"It's almost Halloween, and the subreddits are already dressing up! Here are a few of (y)our favorite new community stylings","Over the past several weeks, we’ve been [talking *a lot* about community styling](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/9dx376/introducing_friday_fun_threads_todays_topic/) with redditors in r/redesign, covering every topic under the sun—from the custom images mods use to replace upvotes and downvotes to all the delightfully strange takes on [our alien mascot Snoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/9j4r5v/friday_fun_thread_wednesday_edition_what_are_your/). 

We kicked off these discussions (dubbed the “Friday Fun” series, despite the fact that it has occasionally come out on Wednesday and we’re currently celebrating it on—what else?—[a Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsmVgoXDq2w)) as a way to celebrate all the cool things mods have done with our new styling tools. 

We know we still have work to do. But since we [first opened new Reddit for business](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/891stx/starting_today_more_people_will_have_access_to/) back in April, we’ve been shipping updates [every single week](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Changelog%20%3Asnoo_hearteyes%3A%22&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new)—improving accessibility, expanding flair, making desktop styles [visible on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/970xqe/community_styling_in_reddit_apps/), and most recently launching [ModMail Search](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9qr6et/search_on_new_modmail_is_here/). 

So, with the spirit of Halloween upon us, we wanted to take a brief break from our work to show off some of the brightest, raddest, identical-iest communities we’ve seen so far.

There weren’t really any “winners,” per se, since that implies someone lost, so this roundup really is a spotlight on the spectrum of awesome communities on Reddit. Because the best part of our job building styling tools is seeing how redditors use them.

We curated this showcase of communities from comments and conversations with redditors on our r/redesign Fun Friday styling posts. Each community has done something to make their identity stand out using our new styling tools, from their Snoovatar to their banner to widgets. Some communities made us giggle like awkward teenagers, some made us drop our jaws in awe, and others we couldn’t stop reloading to see their image widget. 

And now onto the showcase!

# “Twinners”

Creepy twins are a classic trope of Halloween costumes, so we thought it would be fitting to begin with the community stylings that look almost the exact same as in old Reddit (with the added benefit of being visible on mobile, too). Here are a few user-nominated subbies that look scary-similar to their classic counterparts.

# Stand-out Styling Elements

Over the course of our “Friday Fun” discussions about specific parts of community styling (like upvotes, sidebars, banners, icons, Snoos, etc.), we went in every time thinking we’d seen it all, only to be happily proven wrong by redditors who pointed out details we had never noticed in communities across the site. Here are a few user-nominated styles that showed off just how much creativity, thoughtfulness, and welding ability can go into one mod team’s styling.

**Vote Icons**

*Processing img y7572awzg6v11...*

Simple, elegant, and very, very thoughtful. 🤔

**Banner**

*Processing img lx9lbdn3h6v11...*

Look carefully at the background for some super-ior attention to detail (then check out the Snoo-perman icon flexing on the left).

**Flair**

*Processing img 37raea87h6v11...*

We’ve focused [a lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/92e3v6/an_update_on_flairs/) on [improving](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/95dgnx/an_update_on_automod_for_flair_on_the_redesign/) our [flair tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9d89bh/another_update_on_user_flairs/) over the past few months, and we’re thrilled to see communities like r/NASCAR doing laps around the rest of us with how they’ve applied it. 

**Sidebar Extraordinaire**

*Processing img n0yw7pzbh6v11...*

If you haven’t checked out the r/CFB sidebar, get ready to have your socks, shoes, and knee-pads knocked off! This community has used just about every sidebar option available, from CSS widgets to the Related Subreddits listing, calendar, and more. A true styling championship contender, indeed.

*Processing img 1nqc074gh6v11...*

Last but certainly not least, we probably had the most fun digging through all the fascinating artistic interpretations communities have made of [Snoo](https://redditblog.com/2013/06/05/whats-snoo/). While there were many inventive picks for this, one of our all-time favorite nominations was this charming entry from r/welding.

# Overall Style

And now, for the moment you’ve all been waiting for, here are a few of the best overall stylings. Most of these are communities that distinguished themselves by having a combination of styling elements, from custom Snoos and stellar headers to carefully crafted vote icons, sidebars, and a general, shall we say, Snoo ne sais quoi. 

If you haven’t checked them out, just click the links below each one to explore how they styled.

8zwssb,ityoclys,"What I learned from chatting with 7,000 strangers on the internet","**TL;DR:** ***Your feedback helped us reshape the direction of chat on Reddit from one-to-one chat to private group chats and eventually to community-based chat rooms (and your jokes helped me get through many a long day). Chat rooms are now in beta and being released to more subreddits daily. Check out*** [***r/subchats***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubChats/) ***or*** [***this post***](https://www.reddit.com/r/community_chat/comments/8465bl/welcome_to_rcommunity_chat/) ***if you’d like to see how it works!***

Guess what? Chicken butt! (More on that later.) For now, hi! I’m [u/ityoclys](https://www.reddit.com/user/ityoclys), but if you're one of the 7,000 or so people who messaged the admins with your feedback on Chat, you may remember me better as u/reddit_chat_feedback.

Most people still don’t know about Reddit Chat, so, for context, over the past year we’ve been [beta testing](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/comments/8g22ow/subreddit_chat_rooms_beta_has_been_released_to/) a few new chat features with a small number of you. When we started, we knew that most people didn’t personally know other redditors, since the core of the Reddit experience is pseudonymous sharing and discussion, so we wanted to make sure there was a place for people in the betas to test chat, give feedback, and have a bit of fun. Perhaps most importantly, we wanted to get to know people using chat in order to learn from them.

To do this, we made a new user, [u/reddit\_chat\_feedback](https://www.reddit.com/user/reddit_chat_feedback), and added it to the top of everyone’s chat contacts list. Kind of like Tom from Myspace. For some reason, I volunteered to respond to as many people who chatted to that account as I could keep up with. So far I’ve talked to just over 7,000 people one on one. It’s been fun, and now we’d like to share some of the things we learned.

[This is my life now.](https://i.redd.it/yqisevud8qa11.png)

**TIL: Chatting with strangers on the internet isn’t so scary**

If you haven’t used AOL in a while, the idea of chatting with uninhibited strangers disguised behind bizarre usernames might give you pause - especially if you're, say, an admin openly asking for feedback from literally anyone on, say, a platform like Reddit, which is widely known for its passionate and vocal communities. Initially, I was afraid that most people would bring out the pitchforks and… unkind words. But after my first few days chatting with Redditors, I was pleasantly surprised to find that most people are super nice.

The nature of real-time direct chat seems to be especially disarming. Even when people initially lash out in frustration (or just to troll us), I found that if you talk to them and show them you’re a regular human like them, they almost always chill out. Beyond just chilling out, people who are initially harsh or skeptical of new things will often change their minds. Sometimes they get so excited that they start to show up in unexpected places defending the thing they once strongly opposed in a way that feels more authentic than anything I could say.

TL;DR: Don’t be afraid. Listen to people and talk to them, and everything will (usually) be fine.

[People are good.](https://i.redd.it/zwcr1mxg8qa11.png)

**TIL: People will give you excellent and actionable feedback, if you’re willing to listen**

I'm a product designer. I take pride in bringing clarity to our product and engineering ideas, but I also recognize that one person (or even an entire team) working on something new will never match the insights that a community of passionate people can find. Being the voice of u/reddit_chat_feedback has dramatically reinforced that framework in my mind. It's helped me gauge the general sentiment of the people using all the new things we're building, and it's given me a constant stream of users to poke holes in our ideas, all of which directly impacted the direction we took with our roadmaps.

Listing everything we learned via chat would result in a novella, but here are a few common themes that surfaced through chat feedback, and how we adapted to them:

* **Chat on Reddit makes more sense in a group setting focused around a topic than it does in a one-on-one environment.** This makes a lot of sense, but might not be initially obvious as so many chat platforms focus on connecting people who already know each other IRL. People on Reddit [don’t usually know each other IRL](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaveWeMet/), and aren’t sure who to chat with without a common focal point. This may have been the most impactful common feedback, and we actually changed our roadmap significantly based on it, shifting our focus to subreddit-based chat rooms before giving access to direct chat to all redditors.
* **No one wants Reddit to become \[insert generic social media platform here\].** This is good. Neither do we! Personally, I like a lot of social sites on the internet, but one of the things I enjoy most about Reddit is the freedom that it gives people to express themselves without worrying that their grandparents will judge them.
* **Redditors like cats.** I do too. In fact I have two, and they’re very cute.
* **Large group chat rooms need powerful and easy-to-use moderation features.** We were pretty sure this was true, but the validation we received via chat was strong, and has led us to focus on core moderation features for chat rooms early.
* **People want to discover and share awesome subreddits.** When you get to know someone in a real time context, sometimes it becomes easier for you to understand their tastes, and share stuff you think they’d like. For instance, I learned about [r/pigifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pigifs/), [r/fairiesridingcorgis](https://www.reddit.com/r/fairiesridingcorgis/), and [r/specializedtools](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/).

[Yes, cat in French is chat.](https://i.redd.it/40dzc5vj8qa11.png)

**TIL: The internet is full of funny, witty, and weird people (jk, I already knew that)**

Okay, so I didn’t exactly *learn* about this via chat feedback, but I thought you might like to experience some of the funnier things I’ve experienced so far in chat. Like the first time u/reddit_chat_feedback reached the front page. And the second time (one day later). Thanks, [r/madlads](https://www.reddit.com/r/madlads/)! Or the time I recited the alphabet with someone from A to AZ (yes, we cycled through the alphabet at least twice over a few days). Or the time someone sent me the entire script to Star Wars Episode 3 (we added a max message length after that one…). Or the time I learned about snails. Anyway, here you go.

[Snails: the more you know](https://i.redd.it/4abftavo8qa11.png)

**TIL: how to make it to the front page**

At one point during my adventures as u/reddit_chat_feedback, some very [mad lads tricked me](https://www.reddit.com/r/madlads/comments/8bp26k/reddit_didnt_see_it_coming/) and then [tricked me again](https://www.reddit.com/r/madlads/comments/8bvqab/another_one_bites_the_dust/). My chat inbox was absolute madness for at least a week. But it was fun to be referenced on the front page.

**We want to keep learning**

Using [u/reddit\_chat\_feedback](https://www.reddit.com/user/reddit_chat_feedback) as a way to get to know and learn from redditors has been fun and incredibly insightful. We can’t thank everyone who has talked with us and given feedback enough. But we’d like to hear more. If you want to talk about chat on Reddit, please get in touch!

Before I go, I’ll end with a cat fact: Did you know that a group of cats is called a clowder? It’s true. I learned it on Reddit.

7ul5k9,Amg137,"Hey, we're here to talk about that desktop redesign you're all so excited about!","Hi All,

As [u/spez](/user/spez) has mentioned a [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/) [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/) [now](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7u2zpi/not_my_first_could_be_my_last_state_of_the/), we’ve been hard at work redesigning Reddit. It’s taken over a year and, starting today, we’re launching a mini blog series on r/blog to share our process. Over the next few weeks, we’re going to cover a few different topics: 

* **the thinking behind the redesign** \- our approach to creating a better desktop experience for everyone \(hey, that’s today’s blog post!\),
* **moderation in the redesign** \- new tools and features to make moderating on desktop easier,
* **Reddit's evolution** \- a look at how we've changed \(and not changed\) over the years,
* **our approach to the design** \- how we listened and responded to users, and 
* **the redesign architecture** \- a more technical, “under the hood” look at how we’re giving a long overdue update to Reddit’s code stack.

But first, let’s start with the big question on many of your minds right now.

### Why are we redesigning our Web Experience?

We know, we know: you love the old look of Reddit \(which [u/spez](/user/spez) lovingly described as “dystopian Craigslist”\). To start, there are two major reasons:

#### To build features faster:

Over the years, we’ve received countless requests and ideas to develop features that would improve Reddit. However, our current code base has been largely the same since we launched...more than 12 years ago. This is problematic for our engineers as it introduces a lot of tech debt that makes it difficult to build and maintain features. Therefore, our first step in the redesign was to update our code base. 

#### To make Reddit more welcoming: 

What makes Reddit so special are the thousands of subreddits that give people a sense of community when they visit our site. At Reddit’s core, our mission is to help you connect with other people that share your passions. However, today it can be hard for new redditors or even longtime lurkers to find and join communities.  \(If you’ve ever shown Reddit to someone for the very first time, chances are you’ve seen this confusion firsthand.\) We want to make it easier for people to enjoy communities and become a part of Reddit. We’re still in the early stages, but we’re focused on bringing communities and their personalities to Popular and Home, by exposing global navigation, community avatars to the feed, and more.

### How are we approaching the redesign?

We want everyone to feel like they have a home on Reddit, which is why we want to put communities first in the redesign. We also want communities to feel unique and have their own identity. We started by partnering with a small group of moderators as we began initial user testing early last year. Moderators are responsible for making Reddit what it is, so we wanted to make sure we heard their feedback early and often as we shaped our desktop experience. Since then, we’ve done countless testing sessions and interviews with both mods and community members. This went on for several months as we we refined our designs \(which we’ll talk about in more detail in our “Design Approach” blog post\). 

As soon as we were ready to let the first group of moderators experience the redesign, we created a subreddit to have candid conversations around improving the experience as we continued to iterate. The subreddit has had over 1,000 conversations that have shaped how we prioritize and build features. We expected to make big changes based on user feedback from the beginning, and we've done exactly that throughout this process, making shifts in our product plan based on what we heard from you. At first, we added people in slowly to learn, listen to feedback, iterate, and continue to give more groups of users access to the alpha. Your feedback has been instrumental in guiding our work on the redesign. Thank you to everyone who has participated so far.

### What are some of the new features we can expect?

Part of the redesign has been about updating our code base, but we're also excited to introduce new features. Just to name a few:

**Change My View**

Now you can Reddit your way, based on your personal viewing preferences. Whether you’d prefer to browse Reddit in [Card view](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif) \(with auto\-expanded gifs and images\), [Classic view](https://i.redd.it/q3ysf2phhnd01.gif) \(with a similar feel as the iconic Reddit look: clean and concise\) or [Compact view](https://i.redd.it/4egg3y5lhnd01.gif) \(with posts condensed to make titles and headlines most prominent\), you can choose how you browse.

**Infinite Scroll &amp; Updated Comments Experience**

With [infinite scroll](https://i.redd.it/hituybj6hnd01.gif), the Reddit content you love will never end, as you keep scrolling... and scrolling... and scrolling... forever. We’re also introducing a lightbox that combines the content and comments so you can instantly join the conversation, then get right back to exploring more posts. 

**Fancy Pants Editor**

Finally, we’ve created a new way to post that doesn't require markdown \(although **you** *can* \^still \^\^use \^\^\^it! \) and lets you post an [image and text](https://i.redd.it/vco5jc8egnd01.gif) within the same post.

### What’s next?

Right now, we’re continuing to work hard on all the remaining features while incorporating more recent user feedback so that the redesign is in good shape when we extend our testing to more redditors. In a few weeks, we’ll be giving all moderators access. We want to make sure moderators have enough time to test it out and give us their feedback before we invite others to join. After moderators, we’ll open the new site to our beta users and gather more feedback \([here’s how to join as a ](https://i.redd.it/kyhqk5c55gd01.gif)beta tester\). We expect everyone to have access in just a few months! 

In two weeks, we’ll be back for our next post on moderation in the redesign. We will be sticking around for a few hours to answer questions as well. ",2451,1517512376,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/,blog,6746

7fx1x4,spez,An update on the fight for the free and open internet,"Hi All,

If you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what’s happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.

On Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You’ve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. 

In just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday’s news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.

As many of you know, the FCC’s vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality’s giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don’t see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.

Most of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don’t introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC’s decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel’s suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to “make a ruckus” to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  

A few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, we’re asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. 

We will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to — if it comes to it — the Supreme Court. 

So, please tell us in the comments:

*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* 

Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.

Thank you.

6mtgtp,kn0thing,We need your voice as we continue the fight for net neutrality,"My fellow [redditors](https://www.reddit.com/mobile/download), 

When Steve and I created this site twelve years ago, our vision was simple but powerful. We wanted to create an open platform for communities and their members to find and discuss the content they found most interesting. And today, that principle is exactly what net neutrality is all about: preserving an open internet with consumer choice and unimpeded access to information.

Net neutrality ensures that the free market—not big cable—picks the winners and losers. This is a [bipartisan issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/6c2mzt/antinet_neutrality_is_everyones_problem/), and we at Reddit will continue to fight for it. We’ve been here [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2sjkf0/join_us_in_a_final_push_for_net_neutrality_its_as/), and this time we’re facing even worse odds.

But as we all know, you should never tell redditors the odds.

### A level playing field

Net neutrality gives new ideas, online businesses, and up-and-coming sites—like Reddit was twelve years ago—the opportunity to find an audience and grow on a level playing field. Saving net neutrality is crucial for the future of entrepreneurship in the digital age.

We weren’t always in the [top ten most-viewed sites in the U.S.](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US) When Steve and I started Reddit right out of college, we were just two kids with $12K in funding and some computers in Medford, MA. Our plan was to make something people wanted, because we knew if we accomplished that, we could win—even against massive incumbents. 

But we wouldn’t have succeeded if users had to pay extra to visit our website, or if better-funded alternatives loaded faster. Our start-up got to live the American dream thanks to the open internet, and I want to be able to tell aspiring entrepreneurs with a straight face that they can build the next Reddit. If we lose net neutrality, I can’t tell them that.

### We did it, Reddit, and we can do it again.

You all are capable of creating movements.

I’ve had a front-row seat to witness the power of Reddit communities to rally behind a common goal—starting when you all named a whale [Mister Splashy Pants](https://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media) in 2007. It’s been heartening to watch your collective creativity and energy over the years; it’s easy to take all these amazing moments of community and conversation for granted, but the thing that makes them all possible is the open internet, which unites redditors as an issue above all.

Here’s a quick recap:

* In 2012, [we coordinated with mods to black out the website to protest SOPA &amp; PIPA](https://redditblog.com/2012/01/10/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all-depends/). They called these two bills “inevitable” in DC until America spoke up and they became “unthinkable.”
* Then, [you all crowdfunded a bus we took through the heartland to support the open internet](http://www.adweek.com/digital/inside-reddits-internet-2012-bus-144244/). 
* Back in 2014, [you all rallied to deluge the FCC with thoughtful comments in support of net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/275mqp/reddit_there_are_only_45000_comments_on_the_fccs/), and [we collected your best comments for our own letter to the FCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2aohmu/reddit_is_filing_an_fcc_comment_to_fight_for_an/). 
* [You crowdfunded $20,000 to put up net neutrality ads across DC](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/13/5711012/net-neutrality-protest-posters-go-up-across-washington-ahead-of-fcc-vote).
* In the span of a few hours, [you made over 15,000 phone calls to the FCC and your representatives](https://redditblog.com/2015/01/15/join-us-in-a-final-push-for-net-neutrality-its-as-easy-as-calling-858-wheeler/)!

And all of this actually *worked*.

It’s not just about the U.S., because [redditors in India have used the site to defend net neutrality](https://redditblog.com/podcast/a-neutral-net-part-two/) and the CRTC (the Canadian equivalent of the FCC) [visited r/Canada for a thoughtful (and 99% upvoted!) discussion with citizens](https://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/54kz6g/im_from_the_crtc_and_we_want_to_know_what_you/). 

Reddit is simply too large to ignore, and you all did all of this when we were just a fraction of the size we are today.

### Time to get back to work

We’re proud to join major internet companies like Amazon, Etsy, Twitter, and Netflix ([better late than never!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/06/15/netflix-joining-next-months-net-neutrality-protest-says-it-will-never-outgrow-the-fight/)) in today’s Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality, orchestrated by Fight for the Future. We’ve already been hosting AMAs on the subject with politicians (like [Senator Schatz](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6k27ny/im_us_senator_brian_schatz_lead_democrat_on_the/)) and journalists (like [Brian Fung from the Washington Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6lfkwh/im_brian_fung_a_washington_post_reporter_covering/)). Today we’re changing our logo and sharing a special message from Steve, our CEO, with every visitor to our front page to raise awareness and send people to **[BattleForTheNet.com](http://battleforthenet.com)**. Most exciting, [dozens of communities on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) (with millions of subscribers) across party lines and interest areas have joined the cause. If your community hasn’t joined in yet, now’s the time! (And you’ll be in good company: u/Here_Comes_The_King is on our side.)

*The FCC [is deciding this issue the way big cable and ISPs want it to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/18/fcc-votes-to-start-rolling-back-landmark-net-neutrality-rules/?utm_term=.b7242cbf9cd1), so it’s on us as citizens to tell them—and our representatives in the Senate and House—how important the open internet is to our economy, our society, and especially for when we’re bored at work.*

I invite everyone who cares about this across the internet to come talk about it with us on Reddit. Join the conversation, upvote stories about net neutrality’s importance to keep them top of mind, [make a high-quality GIF or two](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/6gnyl4/giffing_for_net_neutrality/), and, most importantly, [contact the FCC](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) to let them know why *you* care about protecting the open internet.

This is how we win: when every elected official realizes how vital net neutrality is to all of their constituents.

5r43td,kn0thing,An Open Letter to the Reddit Community,"After two weeks abroad, I was looking forward to returning to the U.S. this weekend, but as I got off the plane at LAX on Sunday, I wasn't sure what country I was coming back to.

President Trump’s recent executive order is not only potentially unconstitutional, but deeply un-American. We are a nation of immigrants, after all. In the tech world, we often talk about a startup’s “unfair advantage” that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage, and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur.

As many of you know, I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide.

A little over a century ago, a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy, the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians, including my great grandmother, found sanctuary in Aleppo, Syria—before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained, rather they found this message:

*“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”*

My great grandfather didn’t speak much English, but he worked hard, and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton, NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children, all born in the U.S., immigration continued to reshape their family, generation after generation. The one son they had—my grandfather [(here’s his AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29039l/iam_john_ohanian_92_year_old_lawyer_parttime/)—volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother, a native of Hamburg, Germany, decided to leave her friends, family, and education behind after falling in love with my father, who was born in San Francisco.

She got a student visa, came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair, uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left, but she didn't. After she and my father married, she received a green card, which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German, but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I’ll never forget her swearing in ceremony.

If you’ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens, it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with, simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here, to create value and jobs for these United States.

My forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I’ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. 

Without them, there’s no me, and there’s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let’s not forget that we’ve thrived as a nation because we’ve been a beacon for the courageous—the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed.

Right now, Lady Liberty’s lamp is dimming, which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines—past, present, and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit, whether it's calling your representative (this works, it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA), marching in protest, [donating to the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu), or voting, of course, and not just for Presidential elections.

Our platform, like our country, thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit, Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.

1ytp7q,cupcake1713,remember the human,"Hi reddit. cupcake here.

I wanted to bring up an important reminder about how folks interact with each other online. It is not a problem that exists solely on reddit, but rather the internet as a whole. The internet is a wonderful tool for interacting with people from all walks of life, but the anonymity it can afford can make it easy to forget that really, on the other end of the screens and keyboards, we're all just people. Living, breathing, people who have lives and goals and fears, have favorite TV shows and books and methods for breeding Pokemon, and each and every last one of us has opinions. Sure, those opinions might differ from your own. But that’s okay! People are entitled to their opinions. When you argue with people in person, do you say as many of the hate filled and vitriolic statements you see people slinging around online? Probably not. Please think about this next time you're in a situation that makes you want to lash out. If you wouldn't say it to their face, perhaps it's best you don't say it online.

Try to be courteous to others. See someone having a bad day? Give them a compliment or ask them a thoughtful question, and it might make their day better. Did someone reply to your comment with valuable insights or something that cheered you up? Send them a quick thanks letting them know you appreciate their comment.

So I ask you, the next time a user picks a fight with you, or you get the urge to harass another user because of something they typed on a keyboard, please... remember the human.",4272,1393274097,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/,blog,6127

1sndxe,alienth,We've rewritten our User Agreement - come check it out. We want your feedback!,"Greetings all,

As you should be aware, reddit has a User Agreement. It outlines the terms you agree to adhere to by using the site. Up until this point this document has been a bit of legal boilerplate. While the existing agreement did its job, it was obviously not tailored to reddit.

Today we unveil a completely rewritten User Agreement, which can be found **[here](http://reddit.com/help/useragreement)**. This new agreement is tailored to reddit and reflects more clearly what we as a company require you and other users to agree to when using the site.

We have put a huge amount of effort into making the text of this agreement as clear and concise as possible. **Anyone using reddit should read the document thoroughly!** You should be fully cognizant of the requirements which you agree to when making use of the site.

As we did with the [privacy policy change](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1dhw2j/reddits_privacy_policy_has_been_rewritten_from/), we have enlisted the help of Lauren Gelman (/u/LaurenGelman). Lauren did a fantastic job developing the privacy policy, and we're delighted to have her involved with the User Agreement. Lauren is the founder of BlurryEdge Strategies, a legal and strategy consulting firm located in San Francisco that advises technology companies and investors on cutting-edge legal issues. She previously worked at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society, the EFF, and ACM.

Lauren, along with myself and other reddit employees, will be answering questions in the thread today regarding the new agreement. Please let us know if there are any questions, concerns, or general input you have about the agreement.

The new agreement is going into effect on **Jan 3rd, 2014**. This period is intended to both gather community feedback and to allow ample time for users to review the new agreement before it goes into effect.

cheers,

alienth

Edit: Matt Cagle, aka /u/mcbrnao, will also be helping with answering questions today. Matt is an attorney working with Lauren at BlurryEdge Strategies.",2473,1386785474,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1sndxe/weve_rewritten_our_user_agreement_come_check_it/,blog,2001

1nl0fw,jenakalif,Remaking Our Self-Serve Advertising System,"**[This post is also mirrored on reddit’s blog.](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/10/remaking-our-self-serve-advertising.html)**

The reddit self-service advertising system is going through a much-needed overhaul. This system is built in-house by reddit admins (with some valuable help from [our ad server Adzerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1aqp5c/quick_update_about_ads_on_reddit/)) and allows for anyone with a reddit account (and a verified email address) to run sponsored headlines across reddit. This won’t affect much of your day-to-day use of reddit, but we wanted to explain what we’ve done and why we’re doing it.

A sponsored headline is the blue stickied post at the top of the page. These ads have been available for any redditor to purchase since [2009](http://blog.reddit.com/2009/11/now-for-as-little-as-20-you-can-buy.html). These headlines are run differently than the image banners that show up on the right side of the site. The image based ads don't have a self-service option, but have always been sold on a CPM basis (CPM is an advertising term for the cost of 1,000 impressions).

The new self-service platform will be sold on a CPM basis. This means that there will be a set price (currently $0.75) for 1,000 impressions of your ad. This is a departure from our old pseudo-bidding system where you bought a portion of all available impressions — you named how much you were willing to spend, but you’d have little guarantee on how many impressions you’d get for that set price, which made it very difficult to tell how many people would see your ad. This semi-lottery based system prevented us from offering ads to reddit users in many countries outside of the U.S. (anyone that didn’t have credit cards in the U.S., U.K., and Canada weren’t able to purchase ads). It was tough to have to turn away many overseas redditors who had some great products, and we hope to welcome you back with our new system.

Sponsored headlines can now include dropdown text, marked by the “Aa” box. Advertisers are able to now use the longer text box to share stories about how they started their companies or products, link to other sources of information, or even [excerpt a chapter from their book](http://www.reddit.com/comments/1kql8t/hey_reddit_reddit_cofounder_here_with_an_excerpt/). We’ve had some advertisers set up campaigns, and though our sample size is small, early indications are that these ads do better because they are more informational and interesting — there are two times the average time on page on these ads compared to normal reddit post!

This is the first very important step in making the self-service platform a great advertising tool for the reddit community. [To reiterate our commitment from last May](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/05/upgrading-our-self-serve-system.html), while reddit also runs ads from brands and outside companies, we want to build an ads system that is a community resource — a system for redditors to advertise to each other. As we grow this system, we want to add features of other robust self-serve systems, like enabling discount codes for redditors, A/B testing, or geotargeting — but we want to design it in a way to serve the reddit community’s own particular needs. For example, users may want to use it to inform others about causes they’re promoting, or to try and find more subscribers for a new subreddit they’ve just created - or simply to promote an event in a localized subreddit.

To set up an ad, you can visit the self-serve advertising tab in your account or [go directly to the “create a promotion” page here](http://www.reddit.com/promoted/new_promo).

We’re also experimenting with some new ways to use improve the ads themselves. Some are in the very early stages of development and might not make it, but the following list gives you an idea of ways we're trying to make ads better on reddit by keeping commercial messages separate, clearly identified, helpful and interesting. Advertisers interested in these experiments should email marketing@reddit.com; moderators can PM us at /r/reddit.com.

* **Subreddit ad buyouts.**  In April, /r/gamedeals moderators self-posted about how frustrated they were with affiliate link sponsored headline ads in the subreddit. A redditor from Amazon saw it and worked with us on a solution: Amazon bought out all the /r/gamedeals sponsored headline ads, using some for non-commercial posts and donating its affiliate fee from /r/gamedeals sales to a non-profit. We’ve had this arrangement for the past few months, and it seems to be making the site better for /r/gamedeals redditors. Since the sponsorship, the subreddit traffic has doubled. 

* **Q&amp;A ads.**  We like the format of advertisers answering questions about their products or companies, and want to encourage these conversations. So we’re testing ads where one or more employees of a company answer questions from redditors to see how they do and how you respond.

* **“Thank you” messages.**  We’re working with folks to help them spread positive messages that are not really ads. We’ve seen several advertisers buy ads to thank the reddit community, and we love those ads, because they cared enough to let people know that they enjoy their time interacting on reddit. For example, J Cole was so excited after his AMA in /r/hiphopheads, he took out [an ad as a “thank you.”](http://www.reddit.com/comments/1gwtb0/this_was_an_amazing_experience_love_to_connect/) 

* **Smaller ads.** We’re working on reconfiguring our ad system to test the 300x100 ad as our default banner ad, replacing our standard 300x250 ad in many cases. This change frees up more space on the sidebar for subreddit content and also encourages advertisers to customize their ads for the reddit community.

* **Sponsored contests.** We have had a few companies reach out to us about their interest in giving back to the reddit community through sponsored contests in a variety of subreddits. We've tested this out in a couple of places with some pretty good results, so we're excited at the prospect of doing more around the site! We still have to work out some of the finer details, but keep your eyes peeled for sponsored contests in a subreddit near you.


**What are we are keeping the same:**

* Still no flash

* No frontpage roadblocks of sponsored headlines

* No autoplay video or audio

* No [retargeted ads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_retargeting)

We’ve improved our self-service advertising system recently to make it more consistent, understandable and global. We are working on other improvements to our advertising, and testing out different ad formats, too. We appreciate your feedback in /r/ads, /r/selfserve, and elsewhere, so please keep it coming.",468,1380723783,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1nl0fw/remaking_our_selfserve_advertising_system/,blog,1368

1iwd5i,chromakode,New! Create and share your own collections of subreddits using multireddits.,"I'm pleased to announce that after 2 months in beta, our new [multireddits functionality](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) is now live. :)

Think of multireddits as collections of subreddits that you discover or create &amp;mdash; a custom front page of reddit for any topic / interest / state of mind. Multis can be tools to aggregate your favorite networks of subreddits or to showcase a variety of different perspectives.

And, most importantly: they can be shared. Interested in [retro gaming](http://www.reddit.com/user/multi-mod/m/retrogaming)? There's a multi for that. How about a bunch of [drawing communities](http://www.reddit.com/user/multi-mod/m/drawing)? Here's a [multi filled with jokes](http://www.reddit.com/user/multi-mod/m/jokes). Personally, I like to divide my browsing between fun, quick [brain candy subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/user/chromakode/m/candy) and longer form [interesting subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/user/chromakode/m/interesting).

Any multis you create and set as public will appear on the sidebar of your user page. You can share them by URL or by referencing the name in comments like this: /u/reddit/m/redditpets. You can also easily discover multis by browsing /r/multihub, a user-created community dedicated to sharing and discussing multireddits. If you like a multi you find there (or on another user's page), you can make it your own with just a single click. Just click the ""create a copy"" button on the sidebar.

If you're signed in, you'll notice that we've also added a left sidebar to the front page to make it easy to flip between your personal multireddits. You can hide this bar if you like by clicking on the vertical divider between the left sidebar and the page.

Today is only the first step for multireddits; there's many more tools and features that we'd like to add in the future. We have some really cool beta tests coming up for the following improvements:

 * /u/shlurbee and /u/ketralnis have been working on automatic suggestions for which subreddits to add to your multi.
 * /u/bsimpson and I have been exploring adding controls to weight the prominence of subreddits in your multis differently.

You can try out these features first and support new development by subscribing to reddit gold. Keep an eye on /r/multibeta, where we will announce more details in the next few days. Thanks to everyone who has contributed feedback so far in /r/multibeta &amp;mdash; it has been invaluable in polishing today's release.

As always, we'd love to hear your feedback and some of your favorite new multireddits!",1841,1374603075,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/,blog,1832

1dhw2j,alienth,reddit's privacy policy has been rewritten from the ground up - come check it out,"Greetings all,

For some time now, the reddit privacy policy has been a bit of legal boilerplate. While it did its job, it does not give a clear picture on how we actually approach user privacy. I'm happy to announce that this is changing.

The reddit privacy policy has been rewritten from the ground-up. **The new text can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy)**. This new policy is a clear and direct description of how we handle your data on reddit, and the steps we take to ensure your privacy.

To develop the new policy, we enlisted the help of Lauren Gelman (/u/LaurenGelman). Lauren is the founder of [BlurryEdge Strategies](http://www.blurryedge.com/), a legal and strategy consulting firm located in San Francisco that advises technology companies and investors on cutting-edge legal issues. She previously worked at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society, the EFF, and [ACM](http://www.acm.org/).

Lauren will be helping answer questions in the thread today regarding the new policy. Please let us know if there are any questions or concerns you have about the policy. We're happy to take input, as well as answer any questions we can.

The new policy is going into effect on **May 15th, 2013**. This delay is intended to give people a chance to discover and understand the document.

Please take some time to read to the new policy. User privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we want anyone using the site to be as informed as possible.

cheers,

1cyfrk,alienth,DDoS dossier,"Hola all,

We've been getting a lot of questions about the DDoS that happened recently. Frankly there aren't many juicy bits to tell. We also have to be careful on what we share so that the next attacker doesn't have an instruction booklet on exactly what is needed to take reddit down. That said, here is what I will tell you:


* The attack started at roughly 0230 PDT on the 19th and immediately took the site down. We were completely down for a period of 50 minutes while we worked to mitigate the attack.

* For a period of roughly 8 hours we were continually adjusting our mitigation strategy, while the attacker adjusted his attack strategy (for a completely realistic demonstration of what this looked like, please refer to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=2efhrCxI4J0#t=145s)). 

* The attack had subsided by around 1030 PDT, bringing the site from threatcon fuchsia to threatcon turquoise.

* The mitigation efforts had some side effects such as API calls and user logins failing. We always try to avoid disabling site functionality, but it was necessary in this case to ensure that the site could function at all.

* The pattern of the attack clearly indicated that this was a malicious attempt aimed at taking the site down. For example, thousands of separate IP addresses all hammering illegitimate requests, and all of them simultaneously changing whenever we would move to counter.

* At peak the attack was resulting in [400,000 requests per second](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditTraffic/comments/1cq6q0/20130419_graph_of_the_ddos_event/) at our CDN layer; 2200% over our [previous record peak](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditTraffic/comments/1cq6q0/20130419_graph_of_the_ddos_event/c9iy2jf) of 18,000 requests per second. 

* Even when serving 400k requests a second, a large amount of the attack wasn't getting responded to at all due to various layers of congestion. This suggests that the attacker's capability was higher than what we were even capable of monitoring.

* The attack was sourced from thousands of IPs from all over the place(i.e. a botnet). The attacking IPs belonged to everything from hacked mailservers to computers on residential ISPs.

* There is no evidence from the attack itself which would suggest a motive or reasoning.

**&lt;conjecture&gt;**

I'd say the most likely explanation is that someone decided to take us down for shits and giggles. There was a lot of focus on reddit at the time, so we were an especially juicy target for anyone looking to show off. DDoS attacks we've received in the past have proven to be motivated as such, although those attacks were of a much smaller scale. Of course, without any clear evidence from the attack itself we can't say anything for certain.

**&lt;/conjecture&gt;**


On the post-mortem side, I'm working on shoring up our ability to handle such attacks. While the scale of this attack was completely unprecedented for us, it is something that is becoming more and more common on the internet. We'll never be impervious, but we can be more prepared.

1aqp5c,jenakalif,Quick update about ads on reddit,"As you [may have noticed](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1amdz9/does_reddit_work_with_doubleclick_and_adzerk_now/) browsing reddit the past couple of weeks, we have been phasing in a new ad provider called [Adzerk](http://www.adzerk.com/) to serve the image ads in the sidebar. We will be joining the likes of [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) in using Adzerk's platform, which is flexible, powerful, and fast.

Our primary goal is to make advertisements on reddit as useful and non-intrusive as possible. We take great pride in the fact that reddit is one of the few sites where people actively disable ad blockers. reddit does not allow animated or visually distracting ads, and whenever possible, we try to use ads as a force of good in our communities.

We've started to turn on Adzerk in a few subreddits like /r/funny and /r/sports, and they'll be replacing DoubleClick for Publishers and our own house system ads completely moving forward. Practically speaking, you probably won't notice much difference from this change, but Adzerk does provide us some really cool features. For example, if you dislike a particular ad in the sidebar, it is now possible to hide it from showing again. If you hover over a sidebar ad in /r/sports, a new ""thumbs up"" / ""thumbs down"" overlay will appear. If you ""thumbs down"" an ad, we won't display it to you again, and you can give us feedback to improve the quality of reddit ads in the future.

If you’d like to continue the conversation around ads on reddit, please stop by the /r/ads subreddit!",1136,1363884990,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1aqp5c/quick_update_about_ads_on_reddit/,blog,1932

pmj7f,reddit,A necessary change in policy,"At reddit we care deeply about not imposing ours or anyone elses’ opinions on how people use the reddit platform. We are adamant about not limiting the ability to use the reddit platform even when we do not ourselves agree with or condone a specific use. We have very few rules here on reddit; no spamming, no cheating, no personal info, nothing illegal, and no interfering the site's functions. **Today we are adding another rule: No suggestive or sexual content featuring minors.**  

In the past, we have always dealt with content that might be child pornography along strict legal lines. We follow legal guidelines and reporting procedures outlined by [NCMEC](http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?PageId=1504). We have taken all reports of illegal content seriously, and when warranted we made reports directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, who works directly with the FBI. When a situation is reported to us where a child might be abused or in danger, we make that report. Beyond these clear cut cases, there is a huge area of legally grey content, and our previous policy to deal with it on a case by case basis has become unsustainable. We have changed our policy because interpreting the vague and debated legal guidelines on a case by case basis has become a massive distraction and risks reddit being pulled in to legal quagmire.   
 
As of today, we have banned all subreddits that focus on sexualization of children. Our goal is to be fair and consistent, so if you find a subreddit we may have missed, please message the admins. If you find specific content that meets this definition please message the moderators of the subreddit, and the admins.  
 
We understand that this might make some of you worried about the slippery slope from banning one specific type of content to banning other types of content. We're concerned about that too, and do not make this policy change lightly or without careful deliberation. We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal. However, child pornography is a toxic and unique case for Internet communities, and we're protecting reddit's ability to operate by removing this threat. We remain committed to protecting reddit as an open platform.",13150,1329084338,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/,blog,2969

fjgit,redditjobs,reddit is doubling the size of its programming team,"Earlier this week we announced four new hires, and today we'd like to get started on the next batch: **We're hiring three more engineers!** Ideally, we'd like to get a frontend programmer, a backend programmer, and someone in between. (We're going to need a wider [blog.reddit.com](http://blog.reddit.com/) header!)

To get an idea of what sort of people we're looking for, take a look at [last summer's hiring announcement](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/08/reddit-is-hiring.html). (Seriously, go read it; we'll wait.)

----

**Quick facts**

* Unlike last summer's opening, these will be regular, full-time-employee positions
* They will come with all the standard benefits
* :( We still can't sponsor H1-B's (You have to be legally able to work in the United States already)
* The position is at Reddit HQ in San Francisco [[map](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=reddit%20hq&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=520+3rd+St,+San+Francisco,+California+94107&amp;t=h&amp;z=16)] (We're not sticklers about the whole ""in the office every day by 9am"" thing, but these are definitely not telecommuting positions)

----

**How to apply**

Usually the first step of an application process is to solicit resumes. Candidates are forced to boil years of work down to a few bullet points, attempting to demonstrate what sets them apart without being overly verbose or picking the wrong font. And writing cover letters -- yuck! You stare at your email composition window, sweating over every word and punctuation mark. *Do I sign it ""Yours"" or ""Sincerely""? If I pick the wrong one they won't hire me!*

And then *we* have to read through hundreds of resumes and cover letters (even though the very fact that we're hiring means we have a big backlog of other stuff that needs to get done) and pass them around and scratch our heads, trying to figure out who's the real deal and who's dead-wood-plus-exaggeration. It's like trying to pick the best cellphone by comparing the manufacturers' press releases.

Instead of *first* doing all that, and *then* bringing people in to see if they can code, we're going to do the opposite. So at this first step of the process, we're not yet interested in your resumes or cover letters or references or GPAs. We'll address that if you survive to the second stage; the first thing we want to do is narrow it down to the hackers. 

So we've prepared two challenges. They both reflect real-world problems that we've had to solve -- one at the beginning of reddit's existence, and one that arose when the site became really popular. The first is targeted at front-end wizards, those who might not know how to write database code but wow are they a UI master. The second is for the kind of person who prefers a dark basement and a Unix prompt, someone who hates having to touch the mouse and who might be allergic to CSS.

Pick the one that best suits your talents and see if you can tackle it. **Don't do both.**

----

**Frontend challenge**

We want you to build a reddit clone entirely in HTML, Javascript, and CSS. It will maintain its state entirely client-side (HTML5
localstorage, cookies, whatever), and it's fine for it to be single-user. In fact, we want to leave as much of this challenge open to  interpretation as possible.

The goal here is to show off your ability to make a slick website, not to make something that we're going to deploy in production, so you don't have to worry about scaling, spam, cheating, or even making it browser-portable. If there's some really neat thing that you need Javascript list comprehensions for, or your textareas look best with `-moz-border-style:chickenfeet`, go ahead and use it. We'll defer the drudgery of cross-browser testing and compatibility hacks for when you're on the payroll; for now, just tell us what OS and browser to use (within reason) and that's the one we'll use to judge your work.

----

**Backend challenge**

Like all websites, reddit keeps logs of every hit. We roll them every morning at around 7am and keep the last five days uncompressed. Each of those files is about 70-72 GB. Here's a sample line; IPs have been changed for privacy reasons and linebreaks have been added for legibility:

    Feb 10 10:59:49 web03 haproxy[1631]: 10.350.42.161:58625 [10/Feb/2011:10:59:49.089] frontend
    pool3/srv28-5020 0/138/0/19/160 200 488 - - ---- 332/332/13/0/0 0/15 {Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; 
    Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.7) Gecko/20100713 Firefox/3.6.7|www.reddit.com|
    http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/?count=75&amp;after=t3_fiic6|201.8.487.192|17.86.820.117|}
    ""POST /api/vote HTTP/1.1"" 

We often have to find the log line corresponding to an event -- a ""you broke reddit"" or a weird thing someone saw or to investigate cheating. We used to do it like this:

    $ grep '^Feb 10 10:13' haproxy.log &gt; /tmp/extraction.txt

But as traffic grew, it started taking longer and longer. First it was ""run the command, get a cup of coffee, check the results."" Then it was, ""run the command, read all today's rage comics, check the results."" When it got longer than *that*, we realized we needed to do something.

So we wrote a tool called `tgrep` and it works like this:

    $ tgrep 8:42:04
    [log lines with that precise timestamp]
    $ tgrep 10:01
    [log lines with timestamps between 10:01:00 and 10:01:59]
    $ tgrep 23:59-0:03
    [log lines between 23:59:00 and 0:03:59]

By default it uses `/logs/haproxy.log` as the input file, but you can specify an alternate filename by appending it to the command line. It also works if you prepend it, because who has time to remember the order of arguments for every little dumb script?

Most importantly, `tgrep` is *fast*, because it doesn't look at every line in the file. It jumps around, checking timestamps and doing an interpolative search until it finds the range you're looking for.

For this challenge, reimplement `tgrep`. You can assume that each line starts with a datetime, e.g., `Feb 10 10:52:39` and also that each log contains a single 24-hour period, plus or minus a few minutes. In other words, there will probably be one midnight crossing in the log, but never more than one. The timestamps are always increasing -- we never accidentally put ""Feb 1 6:42:17"" after ""Feb 1 6:42:18"". And our servers don't honor daylight saving time, so you can ignore that whole can of worms. [Edit: you asked for a script to generate a sample log, so [we wrote one](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/fjgit/reddit_is_doubling_the_size_of_its_programming/c1ge0ri).]

You can use whatever programming language you want. (If you choose Postscript, you're fired.) The three judging criteria, in order of importance:

1. It has to give the right answer, even in all the special cases. (For extra credit, list all the special cases you can think of in your README)
2. It has to be fast. During testing, keep count of how many times you call `lseek()` or `read()`, and then make those numbers smaller. (For extra credit, give us the big-O analysis of the typical case and the worst case)
3. Elegant code is better than spaghetti

----

**Final points**

* When you're ready to submit your work, send a PM to [#redditjobs](/message/compose?to=%23redditjobs&amp;subject=Okay%2c+I%27m+ready+to+apply) and we'll tell you where to send your code. You can also write to that mailbox if you need clarification on anything.
* We'd like all the submissions to be in by Tuesday, February 22.
* Regardless of which project you pick, we ask you to please keep your work private until the end of March. After that, you can do whatever you want with it -- it's your code, after all!
* Graduating college seniors are welcome to apply: for an amazing candidate, we'll wait a few months. But we're not going to let anybody quit school to work for us.
* Some of you might be thinking, ""I can't believe reddit is going to make all these poor applicants slave over a hot emacs for two weeks just for the privilege of being allowed to apply for a dumb old job."" Well, first off, it's supposed to be fun. If you don't see the joy in either of these puzzles, please don't apply. And second, we're not expecting anyone to spend weeks on this, or even days. We aimed to make the challenges something that could be put together in a weekend by the sort of programmer we're looking for. And these people *do* exist -- [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/comments/b0a2z/a_reddit_clone_in_two_evenings_and_666_lines_of/?sort=top) wrote a reddit clone in *assembly* over the course of two evenings with a *dip[ ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zshdZJnD-4I#t=1m26s)pen.* Okay, not with a dip pen. But still, quit yer yappin.

elqgs,raldi,Cheaters never win.,"Every now and then, a rumor spreads that someone has figured out a way
to manipulate reddit. Now, we're certainly not going to claim that
we're invulnerable to all possible present and future attacks (lest we attract unwanted attention from bored geniuses),
but in the five-and-a-half years that we've been running this site, a
lot of scummy people have tried a lot of scummy things, and we've
gotten pretty good at defending against them. It's been a long time
since anyone came up with a trick that we haven't seen ten times before.

Unfortunately, it's not enough to thwart the
cheaters. The mere *rumor* of cheating can itself be dangerous: If enough
people believe it, it undermines the trust and cooperation that make
our community work.

That's why we were annoyed last month when Forbes published [a stunningly irresponsible, sensationalist piece](http://blogs.forbes.com/elizabethwoyke/2010/11/10/240-to-place-story-on-digg-front-page-one-marketing-firms-pitch/) that reads like a press release for one of these manipulation companies. There's a link to their site, they give the name of the sales rep, list their services (e.g., $80-$200 to game your link onto the reddit frontpage), discuss bulk
discounts, and describe a client who supposedly saw pageviews rise
5000%. Even their slimy motto made it into the article: ""You talk, and
we make the world listen.""

I wrote to the author the day the piece was published, asking her to
actually test the claims she was repeating. She politely declined.

----

So why are we talking about this today? Well, last night the company
in question wrote to a
number of high-karma redditors, trying to tempt them over to the dark
side. Fortunately, a few [Bothans](http://everything2.com/title/Many+Bothans+died+to+bring+us+this+information) relayed the message on to us, and we've decided to publish an excerpt:

&gt; I work with [repugnant company], a social media agency that promotes clients on sites just like Reddit ... The problem is that our accounts suck :( and we don’t know how to promote on Reddit, and as a result our submissions go nowhere with no votes other than our own single vote from submitting it. What I’m asking is if you would be willing to work with us? We would send you something, and if you think it’s great social media quality content, you could help us promote it through your account. We would of course be willing to pay for your time and effort to push it if you’d be interested.

Now, as much as we want to avoid insulting redditors' intelligence, we're going
to spell out very clearly a number of things you should already know:

1. We know of no company that can successfully manipulate
reddit, though many advertise that they can. The closest success that comes to mind is the ""designer rolex sneakers!"" spam that sometimes appears in the comments before being downvoted, reported, and removed from the site.
2. If you pay a company to game reddit for you,
you're a sucker and you're throwing your money away. Not only will it not work, our anti-cheating code tends to overreact, and you may find it harder than ever to get your links on reddit.
3. If you try to sell your vote to such a company, beware that you
might not actually get paid. (""Oh, I know these guys are dishonorable
toward everyone else in the world, but I'm sure they'll treat
*me* fairly!"")
4. If we catch you attempting to cheat, particularly by joining a voting ring,
you may find your reddit experience... degraded.

Finally, and most importantly of all:

If you have something that you want to promote on reddit, and are
willing to spend money to do it, **[just buy a sponsored link!](/ad_inq)**
It's twenty damn dollars, you won't have a guilty conscience,
you'll help support reddit, and most importantly of all, *it will
actually work.*",1474,1292348099,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/elqgs/cheaters_never_win/,blog,2701

So we are averaging about 50 deaths a month now in Afghanistan. We have all of this fancy technology over there to fight people who plant bombs in the dirt that they trigger with a 10 year old cell phone, and fire unguided RPG's left over from the Soviets, or shipped in from North Korea that brought down a helicopter this week, and they blow up the supply lines at the border crossing in Pakistan.

What do you think about the seemingly double standard towards Pakistan, which is being asked to fight a war started by the US without an adequate initial strategy and too few troops to block movement of taliban/al qaeda into Pakistan. The same war that the US is having difficulty conducting with all it's technical and military resources and then Pakistan with its limited air lift and CAS capability is expected to provide even better results on its side of the border?
When at a time, the Taliban are engaging in talks with Karzai with the active support of the ISAF, why are Pakistani talks with Taliban groups looked down upon? Clearly, Pakistan cannot crush all the various Taliban groups and will have to negotiate with some of them at some point.

With the exception of your Senior Editor, I don't really see any obvious previous connection/interest in military hardware in the profiles of your writers/contributors. Are you gusy writers cutting teeth on milspec or are you milspec people who just happen to know how to write? If the former, how steep was/is the learning curve?
On the topic of cybersecurity/information warfare, one of the greatest sources of confusion for me is determining areas of responsibility between service branches and their associated units. Add in the other DHS agencies and it becomes a nightmare of alphabet soup to try and sort out. Who is supposed to be covering what area? What role does each organization play? Where is the overlap? Could you do an article spelling that stuff out clearly? (This presumes that the agencies/branches know their own roles and where they fit in the US cybersecurity puzzle of course.)

3. phantasmagorical  
Wired has traditionally been a magazine geared towards technology, computers, and pop culture, but the popularity of Danger Room suggests a growing trend in media moving outside of their traditional markets and into more ""niche"" categories. One big example is Rolling Stone, a magazine that is geared towards music-lovers, winning National Magazine awards for writing on the first Marine battalions in Iraq and breaking a story that ultimately cost the top commander in Afghanistan his job
How do you guys feel about this trend in media right now, where smaller markets are covering and breaking stories outside of their usual sphere of influence? Is that something you intended or anticipated from Danger Room's inception?

1. bigbopalop  
This question is specifically for Spencer Ackerman.  
As a journalist for the progressive Washington Independent, you reported on various civil liberties issues. This included decrying the administration's plan to assassinate Anwar al-Awlaki, reporting on Omar Khadr's unjust military commission at Guantanamo Bay, and the denial of habeas corpus rights to non-Afghan detainees held at Bagram. In your new position at non-political Wired, it seems as though the focus has moved towards military technology, tactics, and organization. My question is: is there any pressure from your superiors at Danger Room to avoid writing about issues from a 'liberal' perspective? I ask this as a long-time admirer of your work. -bigbopalop

dzl1o,KeyserSosa,"And like that, poof.  He's gone. ","I realized recently that I'm the record holder for longest reddit employment.  It's incredible to think that, back when I started working at reddit five years ago, our *monthly* traffic totals were 38k uniques and 750k impressions (incredibly we now do more than that every *hour*), [there was no commenting](http://web.archive.org/web/20051031043311/http://www.reddit.com/), and we were just beginning to undertake [a drastic site rewrite from lisp into an exotic new language called python](http://blog.reddit.com/2005/12/on-lisp.html).

Though over the years we've had a fair share of bumps and outages, I daresay we are now thriving, and after a lot of thought I've decided to leave reddit (the job part anyway) on a high note.  This community has accomplished so much in the last few months (to say nothing of the previous years) that I can't help to be humbled and proud to have been a part of it.  I feel like my affinity for this community (and to some extent what I see on the site and what I just got to [witness](http://i.imgur.com/8R5nY.png) on the Mall in DC) is closer to patriotism than I would have believed possible in what is, on the surface and to an outsider, an exercise in Text with Strangers.

With the patriotic analogy in mind, I'm not sure if I should be saying ""I'm moving on from my job at reddit"" or ""I hearby resign the office of a reddit employee effective immediately"".  Nah.  Too formal.  How about ""I hearby pass the mop...""?  [ketralnis](/user/ketralnis), [raldi](/user/raldi), [jedberg](/user/jedberg), [hueypriest](/user/hueypriest), and [Paradox](/user/Paradox) aren't going anywhere, and we've made a lot of progress on the ""additional engineers"" front.  We'll be putting up another round of job postings soon...and have some good news about the last round that will be coming soon in another blog post. 

Either way, I love this community, and though I'm turning in my company keyboard, I'll be sticking around thank-you-very-much.  To kill any conspiracy theories in the cradle, my parting with Conde Nast has been nothing but amicable.  I have no doubt I'll be partaking in an odd job now and again on the site.  As we've so oft been glad to point out when someone else asks for a feature, [we're open source](http://code.reddit.com/) after all.

In an interesting coincidence, I got [nominated to redditor of the day](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditoroftheday/comments/dzl1t/keysersosa_redditor_of_the_day_november_1_2010/) a little while back and finally got around to answering my questionnaire (not to say I'm finding my time to be any freer these days).

djm1m,reddit,reddit needs a new motto (or maybe it doesn't),"The motto on the front page of reddit has been ""what's new online"" from 2005
until about a week ago when, in a burst of Colbert excitement (and for the
lulz), [we temporarily changed it to ""where dreams come
true""](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dezvb/breaking_colbert_rally_is_confirmed_for_october/c0zpxxh?context=1).

We were about to change it back just now, but we realized that ""what's new
online"" doesn't really say very much about reddit or why it's special. When
those words were written, we were just a link aggregator -- not only were
there no self posts, there weren't even *comments.* We're a very different site these days.

On one hand, oldschool redditors often feel we've strayed too far from our original mission of being a stark list of interesting new links with a high [SNR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio). Others *like* the community aspect, preferring reddit to be a place where people hang out, get to know each other, and make their own news.

What do you think? Can it be both? And what words should appear in the title?

reserve the right to ignore the most-upvoted suggestion if it's something like ""reddit.com: stupid crap for morons"")*

depct,KeyserSosa,...and now for a word from our sponsor (because for once we have one *asking* to hear your feedback).,"Yesterday, reddit started running ads for a new sponsor. While we normally
don't introduce new campaigns [insert joke about never having a campaign to
announce], this one is notable because the advertiser actually seems to
understand what reddit can offer that traditional advertising (even
traditional *web* advertising) cannot.

See, Microsoft is getting ready to release Internet Explorer 9, and they
reached out to us because they genuinely want to start a dialog with the
reddit community. **In fact, they've taken the unprecedented step of putting
the reddit team in charge of this entire campaign.** This is a great deal of
trust for an advertiser to offer, and we should both take it as a huge
compliment.

So, how should we do this? If there's one thing I've learned in my five-plus
years at reddit, it's that the direct and open approach works best, so
instead of marketspeak, I'm going to paste a quote from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_9):

&gt; IE9 will have complete or nearly complete support for all CSS 3 selectors,
&gt; border-radius CSS 3 property, faster JavaScript, and embedded ICC v2 or v4
&gt; color profiles support via Windows Color System. IE9 will feature
&gt; hardware-accelerated graphics rendering using Direct2D, hardware
&gt; accelerated text rendering using DirectWrite, hardware accelerated video
&gt; rendering using Media Foundation, imaging support provided by Windows
&gt; Imaging Component, and high fidelity printing powered by the XPS print
&gt; pipeline. IE9 also supports the HTML5 video and audio tags and the Web
&gt; Open Font Format.

If you have a computer that can run IE9, we'd really like you to **[try it out](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9743529)**
and post a review. The actual IE9 programmers are going to read what you
have to say, and if you compliment their work, it'll totally make their
day. But they also need to hear your complaints. Ideally, in the form of
constructive criticism, but we warned them that reddit can sometimes be a
little... brisk, so they're prepared for that, too.

One last thing: Microsoft's not the only ones who want your feedback. We at
team reddit are interested in hearing what you think of this campaign in a
general sense: do you find this kind of advertising more appealing than
sidebar ads? Do you have any suggestions as to how it could be even
better? (Especially things that could never happen in a magazine.)

Oh, and stay tuned for a Microsoft IamA next week.  We're not sure who it will be with yet, but we've been assured it won't just be with flack. ",3300,1284646261,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/depct/and_now_for_a_word_from_our_sponsor_because_for/,blog,1863

*Dear Redditors,*

*Ever since the visit of one of your Dear Leaders, Alexis ""kn0thing"" Ohanian, my inbox has been orangered with pleas to ""Restore Truthiness."" The track record of your hivemind speaks for itself. Mr. Splashypants got a name. You rescued Soapier. You frightened the sweet-and-sour Jesus out of a 90-year-old man on his birthday. Despite how silly and nonsexual reddit can be, your true colors show when someone is in need.*

*You have inspired me by helping untold thousands of students; with the momentum you've created, we could stage a hundred rallies. I might just call on you, Redditors - for nothing is more terrifying than tens of thousands of Heroes taking to the streets with the faint odor of bacon wafting behind them. Except for bears, obviously.*

*One huge upvote for you.*

ddc0w,reddit,"UPDATE: In less than eight hours, the ColbertRally movement has completely obliterated Hillary Clinton's record *and* the charity's tallying server","On this special occasion, we've taken the liberty of going into the reddit database and editing this post's title. I hope you understand why. Here's the original post, followed up an update:

----

The drive to organize a Stephen Colbert rally continues to snowball. Over
5,000 people have subscribed to [/r/ColbertRally](/r/ColbertRally). It's gotten a stunning redesign. And now, the community wants to show
that it's not just another lame Internet petition.

See, anyone can join a reddit or Facebook group or sign a petition. It takes, like,
one minute and doesn't demonstrate much effort. So the rally movement has been looking
for ways to show that they're serious, that they're willing to lift a finger
to make this happen. And an idea has just been hatched: pony up some cash to one of
Stephen's favorite charities.

Stephen Colbert is a board member of a non-profit called DonorsChoose.org. It's
a place where schoolteachers can make a request for the supplies they need
and aren't getting. As the name suggests, donors get to choose which specific
teacher they want to support (lazy donors can just let the charity decide). If ""Restore
Truthiness"" can raise a large sum of money, it will be a fantastic show of
strength. And even if it fails as a publicity stunt, it'll still make a
difference in our world.

Speaking of stunts, we at reddit would like to do our part to help propel
this cause: [Hillary Clinton's
been helping DonorsChoose raise money since
2008](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/164383/march-19-2008/pennsylvania-primary).
So far, she's been able to raise
$29,945. That's
good, but we think the reddit and ColbertRally.com communities can blow that
number away in less than a week. So as an added incentive: if we do just
that, reddit has convinced a certain anonymous investor to throw in another $1000 on top of that.

Let's get this started: **[here's where you can donate, and see how much has been raised so far.](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361)**

----

**Update, 20:30 PDT:** You guys are donating so hard, you broke DonorsChoose.org's reporting system! (Don't worry, no transactions were lost and no teachers were injured.) 

While their engineers are scrambling to fix the problem, we've gotten the following stats, manually tallied, [straight from their rep](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ddc0w/update_on_the_colbert_rally_time_to_show_our/c0zec06):

* Eight hours.
* 1,380 unique donors.
* **$46,983** (soon to go up by $1000 once I contact the aforementioned anonymous benefactor)

*Wow!*

dawmo,raldi,The movement to re-restore our nation's honor is picking up steam. ,"It all started just seven days ago with [a self-post on /r/politics](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d7ntl/ive_had_a_vision_and_i_cant_shake_it_colbert/), subject line: ""I've had a vision and I can't shake it: Stephen Colbert needs to hold a satirical rally in DC."" 

This idea struck a chord with the reddit community, and it spread out across the internet. Mainstream media picked up the story. And tonight, on Stephen's first night back on the air, he spent the entire opening segment discussing the rally. (Though he refrained from making any official announcements at this time.)

If this is really going to turn into one of those *Great Moments On the Internet,* we need a place to figure out a way to make it happen. There were a few fledgling communities created for this purpose, and as of today, they've united under one banner:

**If you want to help bring about a Stephen Colbert rally in front of the Lincoln Memorial (a few steps down from where Glenn Beck once famously stood), [join /r/colbertrally and make it happen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/colbertrally)**",1022,1283913166,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dawmo/the_movement_to_rerestore_our_nations_honor_is/,blog,3370

There's [a lot of rabble flying around](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/d66bs/wtf_reddit_i_thought_you_were_cool_reddit_not/), and we wanted to make some points:

1. This was a decision made at the highest levels of Conde Nast.
2. reddit itself strongly disagrees with it, and frankly thinks it's ridiculous that we're turning away advertising money.
3. We're trying to convince Corporate that they're making the wrong decision here, and we encourage the community to create a petition, so that your anger is organized in a way that will produce results.
4. We're trying to get an official response from Corporate that we can post here.

ci811,KeyserSosa,GOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! (Part 2),"[And this time everything went better than expected](http://i.imgur.com/AifD4.png)

What changed? Better caching all around.  One of the big problems had last week was that fetching your list of reddits, though cheap, wasn't cheap enough not to bottleneck when a surge of users came through all at once (in, say, a 5 minute interval).  Normally the list of reddits is quite cacheable because the set of language-preferences in a period of time is usually homogeneous, but while World Cup games were going on they were all over the map.

This was a surprise to us, and since this particular use case only came up in the last few weeks with the world cup, we didn't know we had a problem until it was already happening.  We made that part of the code way cheaper, and it seems to have done the trick. [Also, I'm aware that the match in question was between two English speaking countries, but we've seen much the same behavio(u)r for the last week in every match.]

We also made some improvements on comment and messaging pages, and migrated some swaths of the codebase from Python to Cython.  All of these optimizations will be released when we roll out a new public code release this week.

bx32e,hueypriest,For those of you who know football is played with a round ball: reddit &amp; Intelligence Squared collaborate on a debate about the state of football/soccer today,"*Money, violence &amp; cheats: is this what football comes down to today?*

[Intelligence Squared](http://www.intelligencesquared.com), London's top debating forum, are hosting a football debate at 18:45 (UK-time) on Thursday 29 April and the top questions from this thread will be asked to the panel.  

Speaking for the motion are the sports journalists Tom Bower, Dominic Lawson and Ed Smith and arguing against the motion are the ex-professional football Garth Crooks, Wayne Rooney's ghost writer Hunter Davies and former chairman of the English Football League David Sheepshanks.  Angus Scott, a presenter on Al Jazeera Sport, is chairing the debate.

Is the World Cup the greatest event in the sporting calendar or will it just be an orgy of WAGs and hooliganism? Do fans find meaning and fellowship on the terraces or are they just being exploited by global brands and dodgy billionaires?  Is the sport itself uniquely aesthetically pleasing or is it stagnant and dull?  The speakers will be giving their points of view and this is your opportunity to tackle them on the crucial issues.  

The event will be live-streamed on [www.intelligencesquared.com/live](http://www.intelligencesquared.com/live) and will also be available on iPhones at [http://mobile.livestation.com](http://mobile.livestation.com).  Watch and have your say through comments below.  

For the second consecutive event, Intelligence Squared invites reddit users to kick-start the discussion. This thread will be open for questions until 18.00 UK-time on Thursday 29 April. The questions which receive the most votes in this thread will be posed directly to our panel, and included in the live event, which will be livestreamed online then available on-demand on [Youtube](http://mobile.livestation.com) and [iTunes](http://www.itunes.com/podcast?id=350343972).   

So it's over to you - Ask them anything!

","About 3 months ago [/r/meetup](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup) had the [idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/aij2h/we_should_organize_a_global_reddit_meetup_day/) to hold a ""Global Reddit Meetup Day"". They put it to a [vote](http://www.reddit.com/tb/akcpb/) and **Saturday, June 19th** is the day!  

Mark your calendars and start figuring out how your local redditors are going to celebrate. This will be a loosely organized &amp; non-centralized extravaganza open to redditors in any city, town, or hamlet across the world. Just like [normal meetups](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup), organizing events in the various locations will be up to redditors in those places.   

We're working on a few fun ideas of ways redditors in different cities and redditors that can't make a physical event can interact with each other through space and time, as well as some possible ideas of activities that all of us might be able to do collectively (group pub quiz maybe?). As always, your ideas are surely much better than anything we could come up with, so post any schemes about how to make the global meetup a day/night that our grandkids will self-post about one day.

We're also looking for some creative ideas and good companies that might want to be involved in helping make this day even more entertaining. So, if anybody knows any local or global companies that might want to participate (example: sponsors for free food/drinks or entertainment in one or more cities), please post or [PM hueypriest](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=hueypriest).",1066,1271878126,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/bu9d6/global_reddit_meetup_day_is_happening_on_saturday/,blog,683

The questions and responses were great, and several of the interviewees send us a note saying how much they enjoyed checking out all the replies to their question. However, we felt that the question and might be getting lost at the end of the interview, so we decided to try have the question asked before, so that the interviewee gets to see your responses and comment on those when we tape the interview.

bnaxr,hueypriest,Introducing r/redditvideos - collaborate and discuss reddit interviews and other upcoming videos,"Just over a year ago, reddit published it's first video interview and
[Adam Savage from Mythbusters answered your top 10
questions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8jqea8R-bE). Since then
we've published almost 20 video interviews with various illustrious
individuals.  Thank you all for the interviewee suggestions and
feedback, and thanks to the redditors who helped us arrange some of
the interviews!

As we start on year two, we are looking to get more redditors involved
as collaborators, and make the process for these videos more
transparent. We created [r/redditvideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditvideos) to
discuss upcoming AMA video interviews as well as other video projects
like [reddit IRLs](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bi1pc/reddit_pax/).
Subscribe to [r/redditvideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditvideos) to find out about
upcoming interviews, give us feedback on videos before they go live to
the public, and possibly collaborate with us if you're a video, sound,
or other professional.  The majority of these interviews were either
recorded by one of the 5 reddit admins or by the interviewee
themselves. We think this lightweight and informal approach keeps our
interviews ""honest and unbuttoned"" as recent interviewee Peter Straub
[said](http://twitter.com/peterstraubnyc/statuses/8889470659). We want
to do more interviews and we want to keep increasing the quality of
the ones we do while keeping them ""honest and unbuttoned"". Even if we
had a budget to hire professionals (we don't), we'd still prefer that
all the work was done by redditors. If you are you a videographer,
animator, editor, sound designer, or other professional that could
help us out, you can volunteer or let us know about your services
[HERE](https://leaptec.wufoo.com/forms/reddit-creators/) (link goes to
form on Wufoo). We really appreciate all the technical and
non-technical feedback so far, and could really use some more
collaborators going forward.

We've already had redditor and professional motion graphics designer
juicestain [contribute an awesome animated
intro](http://www.juicestain.com/?p=249) for the interviews. We still
need sound design for the intro, and work with us on other graphic
elements. We also need redditors to shoot interviews that wouldn't be
feasible for one of us to do. We have had to say no to some awesome
interview opportunities because we just couldn't get to the city where
it was going down. Next time, we'd love to be able to call on one of
you to help take advantage of that opportunity. We have some exciting
interviews lined up with outstanding people you've heard of, but we
also want to starting having reddit interview non-famous, but equally
interesting people (a local traffic cop, a grunt in the netflix
shipping facility, a minor league baseball player, etc.) and we need
your help to do that. We don't have budgets right now, but we can
offer credits, shout outs, links, references, and character witnesses
at pending trials for any collaborators. Let us know about your skillz
[here](https://leaptec.wufoo.com/forms/reddit-creators/) or just
subscribe to [r/redditvideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditvideos) and keep an eye
out for stuff in your area or field of expertise (you'll also get to

bflwx,KeyserSosa,Just clearing up a few misconceptions....,"There seems to be a lot of confusion on reddit about what exactly a
moderator is, and what the difference is between moderators and admins.

* There are only five reddit admins: KeyserSosa, jedberg, ketralnis,
hueypriest, and raldi. They have a red [A] next to their names when
speaking officially. They are paid employees of reddit, and thus Conde
Nast, and their superpowers work site-wide. Whenever possible, they
try not to use them, and instead defer to moderators and the community as a whole. You can write to the admins
[here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%23reddit.com).

* There are thousands of moderators. You can become one right now just by creating a reddit.

* Moderators are not employees of Conde Nast. They don't care whether or not you install AdBlock, so installing AdBlock to protest a moderator decision is stupid. The only ways to hurt a moderator are to unsubscribe from their community or to start a competing community.

* [Moderator powers are very
limited](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Moderators),
 and can in fact be enumerated right here:

   * They configure parameters for the community, like what its
description should be or whether it should be considered ""Over 18"".
   * They set the custom logo and styling, if any.
   * They can mark a link or comment as an official community
submission, which just adds an ""[M]"" and turns their name green.
   * They can remove links and comments from their community if they find them objectionable (spam, porn, etc).
   * They can ban a spammer or other abusive user from submitting to
their reddit altogether (This has no effect elsewhere on the site).
   * They can add other users as moderators.

* Moderators have no site-wide authority or special powers outside of
the community they moderate.

* You can write to the moderators of a community by clicking the
""message the moderators"" link in the right sidebar.

If you're familiar with IRC, it might help you to understand that we
built this system with the IRC model in mind: moderators take on the
role of channel operators, and the admins are the staff that run the
servers.",1222,1269025836,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/bflwx/just_clearing_up_a_few_misconceptions/,blog,2004

Big thanks to Prof. Chomsky for sharing so much of his time with our community!   

Make sure you watch [Prof. Chomsky's question BACK to the reddit community](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke6YXjaZ9HY#t=29m35s) 

**Notes:**

Prof. Chomsky answers the top 3 questions in this 30 minute interview. He has said he will try to answer another 5 via email, but is extremely busy this year and will try to get to it when he can. I will post these as soon as I get them, but he has already been very generous with his time, so there is no promise he will be able to get to these.  

Midway through the interview the laptop behind Professor Chomsky goes into screensaver mode and an annoying word of the day type thing comes on. This is MY laptop, and I left it on the desk after we were showing Professor Chomsky all the questions on reddit. Please direct any ridicule for this screensaver at me.

This interview took a month to publish. This is not really acceptable, and I apologize. We were waiting in hopes of combining the video with the additional text answers. This decision is entirely my fault, so please direct any WTF took so long comments about the length of time to publish at me. Thanks for being patient. We will be making our video and interview process even more transparent in the next few days for those that want to help or just want to know all the details.

Big thanks to TheSilentNumber for helping set up this interview and assisting in the production. Any redditor who helps us get an interview is more than welcome to come to the shoot. [PM me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=hueypriest) if there's someone you think we should interview and you want to help make it happen.

3. [BerserkRL](http://www.reddit.com/user/BerserkRL/)   
Question: Although as an anarchist you favour a stateless society in the long run, you've argued that it would be a mistake to work for the elimination of the state in the short run, and that indeed we should be trying to strengthen the state right now, because it's needed as a check on the power of large corporations. Yet the tendency of a lot of anarchist research -- your own research most definitely included, though I would also mention in particular Kevin Carson's -- has been to show that the power of large corporations derives primarily from state privilege (which, together with the fact that powerful governments tend to get captured by concentrated private interests at the expense of the dispersed public, would seem to imply that the most likely beneficiary of a more powerful state is going to be the same corporate elite we're trying to oppose). If business power both derives from the state and is so good at capturing the state, why isn't abolishing the state a better strategy for defeating business power than enhancing the state's power would be?

Joe did a [popular IAMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a630v/iam_joe_lauzon_current_ufc_lightweight_fighter/) a few months ago. You can also check out [Joe's site](http://joelauzon.com) and [twitter](http://twitter.com/joelauzon) for question inspiration.

Notes:  
- This is the first time we're doing a video interview with someone who has already done an IAMA. How will the format or previous Q&amp;A with reddit affect the interview? I have no idea. It'll be interesting to watch.

I regard Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming as a groundbreaking work, it helped me understand advanced lisp techniques and furthered my love for Common Lisp.  What are your thoughts on Common Lisp today? Do you regard it as a lost cause because it is not popular enough and are popularity and momentum more important than technological superiority?  [cerebrum](http://www.reddit.com/user/cerebrum) adds: “You were a big advocate of Lisp, why isn't it used extensively at Google?

8. [khafra](http://www.reddit.com/user/khafra)
With your big emphasis on data over algorithms, vastly successful as it's been, I have to wonder: is there a point of diminishing returns in collecting data, where it's once again worthwhile to spend your time trying to make a cleverer algorithm instead? How do you recognize that point?
