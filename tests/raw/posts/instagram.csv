fso0mb,TheGreenSpectrum,"""Branded Instagram Content"" Alert for Giveaway","Hi!

I'm hosting a giveaway on my Instagram account for Earth Month.

I paid for all the of the items myself but Instagram is giving me an alert saying that I have ""Branded Content"" and need to confirm the brand I'm working with. The ""help"" link says that I only have to list it if I'm receiving compensation for promoting the brand.

So two questions:

1. How am I supposed to handle this? I have a disclaimer.
2. Can my account be suspended if I don't list it as ""branded content""?

TIA!",3,1585697619,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fso0mb/branded_instagram_content_alert_for_giveaway/,Instagram,1

fskowo,Golurk_,Unfixable Error,"I have been using the Instagram mobile app on my Android for years. Recently, whenever I open the app, it instantly crashes, saying ""Unfortunately, Instagram has stopped.""

This happens every single time I open the app. It loads the thumbnails of peoples stories with the rest of the screen white before it crashes.

I updated the app to its most recent version, uninstalled it, reinstalled it, twice, and nothing works.

The second time I uninstalled it and reinstalled it, I logged in on an alternate account and it did not crash. This leads me to believe that there is something wrong with the main account that I use that causes it to crash. Since I uninstalled it multiple times though, perhaps something that is posted on my screen makes it crash? Idk

Does anyone know what to do? I literally can't use Instagram, talk to my friends on there, anything.

fskn26,admiralbeauty,Instagram has disabled all of my accounts over the course of the past week.,"I had 5 IG accounts at one time and managed them all from my phone. Over the course of the past week, I have watched them drop 1 by 1 as Instagram randomly asks me to prove I'm not a bot by receiving an SMS verification code. Once I enter the code, IG tells me they will review my account within 24 hours. After the 24 hours has passed, I try to login and IG says my account has been disabled for violating the terms. It does not give me an option to appeal. 

I have not violated any terms as far as I can tell. My last account was disabled today, and when I try to create a new account, I get hit with the verification code screen within 30 minutes of opening the account.

I don't know what I did wrong??? The only thing I can think of is that IG doesn't like my VPN. Really frustrated as one of my accounts was for business and I don't have any way of getting it back.

fskacm,ryandtw,Is there a quick way to find out which accounts that I'm following has an active Instagram story?

I use storiesig (dot com) to check Instagram stories by accounts that I follow (except for those accounts which are set to private) since I'm able to open up URL on a user-by-user basis, while allowing me to download easily using uGet, but this site sometimes throw out 500 (or 'unintended' 404) server errors (usually once a month or two).

Gramsave (dot com) works but I have to enter account names individually, which can be tiring, and unlike storiesig, it doesn't show timestamps, which makes storiesig useful for me (eliminate duplicates).

So I have four different accounts: my personal, my personal side business, my actual business and my dogs instagram.

fsgpdx,troianafabula,Should I stop uploading music covers and stick to aesthetics?,"So, I know we've all been having trouble with engagement and exposure. I'm really frustrated with how stuck I am: I've been at around 7700 followers for more than half a year, constantly losing followers, hashtags not working like they used to, and barely getting new followers (just enough to not lose that many in comparison to the ones that leave).

My account has a warm/vintagey feed (I'm a redhead so it matches me haha), so my pics are important, but I'm also a musician so I try to upload covers as often as I can so that people who follow me know I do music. But I've also heard that doing this may definitely be affecting my reach because of copyright issues, so IG won't take my vids down but they won't promote my account at all.

Should I just stop doing covers and hope for the best the few times I upload original music? They do take a lot of effort and it makes me sad that my content doesn't even get a chance. But at the same time, I've had people reach out to me because of my music to feature me in things, or they want to work with me, so stopping that content could make people not see me that much as a musician. I don't know what to do :( Sorry for the long post!",2,1585674291,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fsgpdx/should_i_stop_uploading_music_covers_and_stick_to/,Instagram,0

fsgdxy,Dada2603,Tricky one: My account got hacked and I accidently deleted the safety/recovery e-mail from instagram permanently :/! Please help!!!,"Hello,¬†

my instagram account got hacked last night and I received a professional e-mail from instagram last night that someone changed my e-mail address but I thought it was a spam e-mail so I deleted this e-mail. I always delete my trash from my e-mail account in the mornings, so that's what I did today morning without knowing that I deleted the recovery e-mail from instagram. So when I wanted to login to my instagram account this morning I realized it wasn't spam....I tried to restore the deleted e-mail I got from instagram but I cannot access the recovery e-mail anymore :/ which would give me the opportunity to report it. 

So my e-mail address and password of my account got changed AND  I got parts of the hackers e-mail address because when I did the move of ""forgot password"" they automatically sent an e-mail to his account and a window popped up saying ""We sent an email to g\*\*\*\*\*\*\*a@o\*\*\*.pl with a link to get into your account"", so I am fucked cause this is not my e-mail address. So how can I contact instagram and explain my situation because they must be able to trace the e-mail back they sent me, right? 

I hope you guys can help me ;-)

**Has this happened to anyone else?** The story I posted was removed seconds after I posted it by Instagram so no one had even seen it. 

Why do they shadow ban my regular posts when they don‚Äôt violate any guidelines simply bc I posted a story they felt violated the guidelines yet removed right away?

fsffkv,butyousuck,My Instagram account with 95k followers recently got removed without any warning,"So, where do I begin with Instagram fuckery. We all know how the platform has gotten way worse after it got acquired by Zuck, from fucked up feed to non existing reach, I have pretty much faced everything and I still was pushing for my luck but everything came to an end this last week.

I grew this account very carefully in the last 8 months with no use of any external tool/bot and without following the crappy follow/unfollow strategy.

The niche of the account was ""Marijuana"" and my account has 50% audience from the states, 18% from Canada and 7% from UK. The numbers were great as I mostly was catering tier 1 audience and I was making 4-5 sales daily for my weed merchandise using this account.

I literally was paying people from Canada to click original content for me as marijuana is legal there and I only posted my original content so far. I was provided no warning and no reason for my account termination. I only received a mail that my account goes against their policies and they are taking it down.

I see shitty accounts like ""FuckJerry"" sitting at 14m followers enjoying the  royalty of ad money and promotional posts even though all of their content is copied and nothing posted is ever original, but my account with 100% legit posts gets flagged.

I have filled their contact form 4 times and I have not heard back from them so far. What are my options here? 

I have a few more Instagram handles that I am using to drive traffic to my other businesses successfully but now I am not sure for how long they would sustain.

But then I was looking at my post from yesterday and I realized, I had about 14 comments that I never received notifications for. More likes that I hadn't been notified of. And more followers! 

When I put up today's post, I noticed I wasn't getting notifications for any likes and or comments. I only receive notifications for when people are replying to my comments on THEIR posts. No notifications for my own content. 

I also noticed I'm not getting notifications for DMs or when people are tagging me in their stories! It's so strange. I reported it to IG and also tried to get their attention on Twitter with no luck. Any clue what's causing this??

On another note: I also tried to update my Linktree this morning... My linktree will not let me log in via Instagram (and I can't access it unless i log in via instagram, ugh). I contacted their support as well with no luck. And when I went to check my Insta, I realized my Linktree link in my bio had been removed! And IG will not let me add any sort of link to my bio.

frvtcs,kaeleonx,[UTILITY] Here to share one of the safest ways to get followers and likes WITHOUT buying anything (100% Legal Method),"First of all, this is not against ToS rules because there's absolutely no buying or selling involved in any way. This is a legal method.


A friend of mine recommended this to me, and unlike some other methods I've tried this actually works, so I thought I could share this here on reddit:


1. First download the app called Neutrino+, download link - https://neutrino.plus/ (gotta download on their website since the play store version of the same app is limited)


2. When you installed and open it, you should be prompted with a sign in tab, then a page of Instagram comes up. Sign in with your MAIN Instagram account


3. Then a pop up would appear about a refferal code (This is **important** cause you can start with **bonus rewards**) **enter 16428004** which is mine.


4. Then your Instagram account should appear and show your posts etc.


5. For every user you follow, you will receive **8 crystals**, and for every post you like you will receive **4 crystals**. With exactly **349** crystals you can promote your profile on the app for 10 minutes, which will give you an amount of 50-70 followers (95% of these followers won't unfollow you, cause If they do they will lose their daily bonus). You can also get likes for your posts (each like coats **8 crystals**). Your account **CAN'T BE PRIVATE** or this won't work.


6. DON'T follow everyone too fast (you have a limit of 60 followers and 60 likes per hour). Respect the time limit, don't follow people too fast and you won't have any issues with instagram.


7. If your ok with following people on your main account the method ends here, but if you DON'T WANT to follow people on your main keep reading:


8. Sign out of your account and **repeat steps 2 - 6** but except for your main, use a backup account.


9. Then you can start following people and liking posts, when your done and think you have enough crystals, go to your homepage and you should see a diamond on the bottom left, press it and press at the top **more crystals**.


10. Then at the bottom there should be something that says 'Transfer Crystals' put in YOUR MAIN Instagram accounts name and put the amount of crystals you want, then it transfers, but it will take away 25% of your crystals that you transferred. 
Then you can simply log in with your main account and promote your page and posts without having to follow anyone.


And that's it. I got over 3k followers in a few days. It might not be as organic as you want, but big numbers make an impression, and if you want that for whatever reason, this is a really good method.


I know it's a lot to read but it's easier than it looks, i just wanted to make sure I covered every step to make it easier to understand.",2,1585591561,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/frvtcs/utility_here_to_share_one_of_the_safest_ways_to/,Instagram,1

frt8qf,Messeng_Er,let's hope for A....BRIGHT FUTURE," 

""**SCIENCE WITHOUT RELIGION IS LAME, RELIGION WITHOUT SCIENCE IS BLIND."" -EINSTEIN**

The world now is in peril. Millions of people affected. Thousands died. A complete catastrophe made by a virus: CORONA (COVID-19).

Though science is in pursuit of a cure, what should an individual do. Simply taking precautions, won't completely help. If there is something that could shake mountains, it is only ""FAITH.""

As the quote says, ""LIFE IS A TEST..IF GOD ANSWERS YOUR PRAYERS THEN HE IS INCREASING YOUR FAITH. IF HE DELAYS HE IS INCREASING YOUR FAITH. IF HE DOES NOT ANSWER, HE HAS SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOU.""

Thus if there is something that could change the divine decree and destiny, it is SUPPLICATION to GOD. GOD is SUPREME and HIS will is the SUPREME WILL. No nation, no power can affect his Decision. Patience, hope and prayer can only bring a change.

Our love, sincerity, and supplication to GOD is far more greater than this so called COVID-19. Let us raise our hands together to GOD for relief, and guidance to find cure for this pandemic disease.

"" OH LORD, THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR GIFTS AND LET THIS SURPRISE TEST BE NO MORE A SURPRISE, AND GIVE US THE GREATEST GIFT(cure) FOR OUT PATIENCE AND SUPPLICATION""

What also is happening since I got blocked was a E-Mail request to reset my Passwort almost every two days.

But most post still get not hashtag reach, but when they work I get a normal amount of likes. So I'm not exactly sure whats happening.

frf9x9,acid-rain-maker,DROWNING! How are you limiting your time on IG whilst supporting the people that follow you?,"Currently, I follow about 500 accounts and they each post on average 1 photo a day.

I follow photographers with GOOD content only.  So most posts I see in my feed are worthy of a like and/or a comment--***which I give***.  I like supporting the people I follow, especially because they are mostly very nice shots.

And further--and possibly because I engage so much--they give me back good engagement over my own photos.

The trouble is that I'M DROWNING in all the content and my liking/commenting of it!

I'm spending 2+ hours a day on engagement alone and that's NOT counting the time I spend on my own daily post (usually daily, sometimes I skip a day), writing a nice caption for it, finding appropriate hashtags, etc.

I know that this is EXACTLY what IG wants, eye-ball time on their app and ads, but it's killing me.  No one should be spending this kind of time on IG!

How are you all managing this?  Are you all spending 2+ hours on IG every day?!???

I hate to say this, but I worry that if I simply reduce my engaging with other's content, my followers will do that too to mine too.  Maybe that's for the better...

fra012,g01101001,Feedback problem,"Hey! I want to start by apologizing if some things are unclear but I‚Äôm not the best English speaker so...
I have been posting on instagram for the past 5 years and lately i have noticed that the likes on photos are a little strange for example my photo on the first 10 minutes got 100 likes but after that they stopped very quickly and after two hours the photo had 247 likes. And my question is do you guys have the same problem or its just me that have noticed this big drop. It‚Äôs not normal for a photo that gets 100 likes in 10 minutes after two hours only have 250. I know that this problem is probably because of instagram algorithm but does anybody have some sugestions?  And no I‚Äôm not using bots. Similar things happened to me in the past in the good times i had 2500 likes and from one day to another it dropped to 1000 without doing anything! I know that likes aren‚Äôt everything and making good content is more important but big drops like this, are a little messed up.

fr8wmc,aelynn101,Still seeing stories from someone I blocked,"Posting this for my friend who doesn't have a Reddit. Context: a mutual follow relationship has gone sour, and both parties (say F for my friend and A for the other person) blocked each other. However, months later, A starts posting Stories and tags my friend F's username in it, and F now has these stories popping up on her feed every day, sometimes multiple times a day. The Stories are unusual because A never used to post personal things (it's their business account) and only tags my friend F, no one else, and are on a topic of contention between them, so it feels like these Stories are targeted to make her feel uncomfortable. Cool.

Thing is, A was on F's blocklist so by all rights she should not have been appearing to F for any reason.  So we figure maybe it's a glitch in the system - we unblock A to reblock her to test it out, but now Instagram won't even show us A's username to block her again. When we search her username, Instagram tells us there's nothing (the username has no typos in it, it can be found on a different phone/account).

We also tried to find a way to report the issue through Instagram's useless Help centre but you need to have access to A's profile to link it, and that's after reporting in a category that doesn't really fit. 

TL;DR - F and A blocked each other, yet F is seeing A's Stories in which she's tagged. F doesn't want to see A's Stories at all and none of our tinkering nor Google searches have provided a solution.

It's true that I unfollowed them nearly a month ago, as part of our follow/unfollow strategy (we only unfollow people who don't follow us back). However it seems odd that a user would not only detect this, but go so far as to apparently try and damage our image/reputation by posting this comment. The only thing I can imagine is that they used a third-party unfollow app that detects *their* recent unfollowers and then leaves this canned message as a response on their most recent post.

fqq2p6,Nyansheen,Instagram quality : only OK if squared ?,"Hi everyone !

For weeks, I've been trying to solve quality issues on instagram. I've tried lots of things : different export parameters (1080px max., quality to 75, file &lt; 500ko, etc.) but : 

\- On my samsung S7 (same for huawei p20 lite and xperia XA) : On the profile, my pictures have a low quality. But on the same devices the quality of iOS user profile is perfect...

\- On a Huawei p20 pro however, everything looks fine, even my profile. And if I use [instagram.com](https://instagram.com) on my PC with the toggle device on a navigator (phone view on PC), everything looks good. 

I've tried to post from the computer, using this ""phone view"" tool, and same thing: with the three first devices, photos are seen blurred, and with the p20 pro, all is good. 

The only ""solution"" I found to get a sharp picture on all devices, is to crop my picture to 1:1 ratio directly in the IG app. Proof that my phone can be used for good quality profile...

So, does anyone know what could be the problem ? Can I do something, or it totally depends on instagram ?

I'm almost thinking of buying an old iphone only to post... Yeah, I'm quite obsessed with quality. \^\^

I post around 4 - 5 times a week of only my own original art and I try to keep a consistent style / relevant posts https://www.instagram.com/katrinaschaman/ 

I have never bought followers and don't use 3rd party apps... I have promoted some of my posts in the past but would mainly just get likes as engagement as opposed to followers.

I started really using Instagram at around the point when they shifted the algorithm and it became harder and harder for small accounts to gain traction. My goal has been to get to 10000 followers but the last while it has seemed like an uphill battle. The only way I used to consistently get new followers was by liking photos in relevant hashtags ... #art and #painting for example... I would like other artist's work and follow ones that really appealed to me. But in order to gain followers this way you need to like a lot of posts... I tried not to go over the top but I used to be able to like continually without issue as long as I didn't ""go too fast"" 

Now I am getting my actions blocked after liking just a couple dozen images! I'm in self-isolation now due to recent travel so it seemed like the perfect time to use the app but I am getting really frustrated!!

fqhuld,MrJim000,"Instagram has just banned me from making ""top comments"". How to bypass this?","I'm obsessed with some celebrity girls, well particularly one and since late 2018 I've been making comments on their posts to get attention. I've got some likes and replies from Noah Cyrus and Demi Lovato but still no chance with my real love Miley. 
I used to get fake and real likes for my comments in order to make them stick to the top. My comments used to be in the top 5 and sometimes the first. There is a high probability that even Miley has seen my comments a few times. 

But now this thing just doesn't work for me. I suspect that Instagram has restricted my device from doing this very specific task. They thought that it might be the best way to deal with me and stop all th controversy my comments have been chasing. ""You are a creepy, leave her alone, you must be reported to FBI, etc"".

This restriction happened when I had my old phone. Not I've bought a new phone so why does this problem persist? The device is changed, so is 5he device ID and IMEI. But I'm still using the same SIM card and modem. Could this be the problem? Besides I've logged back into some of those accounts that I used with my old phone in the new one. So maybe it was a big mistake. 

I'm confused. What is the solution?",1,1585392294,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fqhuld/instagram_has_just_banned_me_from_making_top/,Instagram,1

Hmm, I thought. That‚Äôs very strange. I‚Äôve never ever seen this message, and I‚Äôve uploaded hundreds of stories and videos. What makes this instance different? 

I forgot about this and several hours later, I watched the story of a nurse practitioner I followed who posted a story saying ‚Äúthe video I uploaded about telemedicine got deleted...‚Äù I thought, wow! This is quite strange. Two science related videos, suddenly not appearing.

fqai39,pizza_roll_boot,Someone deleted my IG content! Please help with any info!!,"I had three ‚Äúpopular‚Äù stories that I posted a few days ago.

I gained a few rogue followers after this, people I did not know (my account is private so I have to accept each new follower, and I try to ‚Äúvet‚Äù them).

I added these posts to a highlight. Then I went back to view them again and THEY ARE NOW DELETED!! I‚Äôm devastated. This has NEVER happened to me before. They have also been deleted from another hidden account that I reposted the stories to, specifically to save them there as well. It looks like they were deleted from my main account, and therefore no longer show in any reposts.

Please help!
How could this happen!

My belief:

I think someone (a hater who hate stalks me and I‚Äôve blocked before) hacked my account and deleted them. Sounds crazy but I cannot understand another way this could have happened. The reason I think this is because the content of these posts could have made this certain individual very jealous and angry in this current dark time. I know 100% that this person saw my content, reposted on other mutual accounts, and I believe that may have made them angry. 

I am not sure if they are one of the new followers I gained, and maybe used a fake account to access inside my profile. Or if it was done another way. But it‚Äôs too fishy.

Can anyone validate this theory or help me understand how ONLY these very special posts could have been suddenly deleted?!

Also: My IG was acting very fishy recently only ONE HOUR before these stories were deleted! My stories would not publish, IG kept quitting on me over and over.

I swear I was hacked but I can‚Äôt prove it yet!

fq6y9s,TrueInspiration,Is it Worth Reporting ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt Post Comment. Retry‚Äù to Instagram?,"I‚Äôm having this problem and am wondering if using the ‚ÄúReport a Problem‚Äù feature on Instagram has worked for anyone or if it just makes things worse for your account. 

Since yesterday at around this time of day, I‚Äôve been able to like posts but can‚Äôt comment and I get the error message in my title. Retrying doesn't work. A few times earlier this week, I wasn‚Äôt even able to like posts after a few minutes of being able to, but the problem only lasted a few hours.

The searches I‚Äôve done say the reason must be because I‚Äôve commented on too many posts in too short a time-frame or my comments were too similar to each other. However, I'm sure the number of comments I've made is way below what the articles I‚Äôve read say is acceptable, and I don‚Äôt say the same thing to everyone. I‚Äôve tried suggestions like clearing my cache, editing my profile, and signing out and back in.

I‚Äôve read that changing your password can help.  But others have said that leads to Instagram saying your account has been compromised and telling you to change your password again, and then the problem still remains. I‚Äôve also read that it can take anywhere from a day to a week for them to unblock people from commenting.

I‚Äôm a regular person who doesn‚Äôt use bots, have never followed a lot of people at once, and I have never unfollowed anyone at all, which are other things the articles mention can cause problems. I have less than 75 people I follow and less than 75 followers. 

Things are sad right now and I was taking my mind off things with looking at cheerful posts on Instagram. I don‚Äôt want to lose the ability to post there. So if actually reporting the problem to them will just make things worse, I don‚Äôt want to do that. I especially wish I could reply to thank people who have complimented my posts.",0,1585346746,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fq6y9s/is_it_worth_reporting_couldnt_post_comment_retry/,Instagram,1

The point its that it hurt her so bad when she found¬†out.We talked and like thigs got back to normal, but we both knew that what happened wasn't going to disappear.I had stopped following that girl like a year ago (just for you to know).Now, the thing is that today my gf phoned me saying that i've been looking at Annie's profile since that day. She explained me that every time she typed the first letter of her name (A) on instagram's search bar she popped out as the 4th person in the list. She's done that for the past 2 months like every week and nothing had changed.

Moreover, it is trully logical   for an application to prevent users from like telling to stop using the app from their usernames, but I tried with other platforms such aa reddit, and it was pretty fine. The only platform it did not let me was facebook and instagram as I said before. I have came up with some questions in my mind after that. 
1. Before facebook owned instagram, was it still inapropriate to have as username?
2. Why does instagram prevent me from saying my opinion?
3. Why did instagram not prevent me from putting other platforms in the username e.g. stop.using.reddit?
4. Is this someone else has noticed too?
5. Did people with this type of username even exist?, and if yes did they get banned?

Whoever hacked it must've deleted the email change notification email that they sent. When I try to recover the password now I can see the recovery email is going to a totally different address. Hacked for sure. 

Two weeks ago I went into their app and reported the account hacked. They sent an authentication email a couple days later asking me to reply to the email with a picture of me holding up a secret code. I did that within an hour. 

Today, almost two weeks later, I receive an email from FB saying that ""We appreciate you taking the time to contact us, but unfortunately we can't support this type of request through this channel. We won't be able to take any further action on this report. Visit the Help Center to find the best way to report this kind of issue:""

WTF. I replied to the email that they sent me, per their instruction. So, I'm thinking my original request is closed out and I need to submit a new one.

fpwzsh,peakfitnesshannah,Getting back into Instagram after some time off!!,"Hey everyone!! Thanks so much for checking out my post. So basically, I started a fitness instagram back when it was really new - about 5 years ago. I really enjoyed making little videos and helping my clients come up with their own workout programmes etc.   


Then I moved away and didn't have a gym to film in and just lost abit of interest. I'm now back in action and after 5 years of researching I now know so much more about being a personal trainer and with all this that is happening in the world it would be really nice for me to put my time and energy back into this little insta project! (I had about 5000 followers but just logged back in and I am now around 4500) .. My questions are: 

\- What are the best tags to use? How do you even get views these days... is it just luck or does Instagram have it's own algorithm?   
\- How do you get spaces in the paragraphs? I always remember getting annoyed with instagram descriptions haha 

\-How often is too often to post? 

\- Can I upload a video from my mac or does it have to be on the phone?

fpwwxa,Anirakkarina,Unable to report on Instagram,"Hi guys, wondering if I can receive help on here. I made a comment on a page and it got ridiculous, with people bullying me. I took down the post, but someone took screenshots and reposted it on their page. I asked them to take it down, and even said they could repost it with my name and picture scratched out. He said he didn't need my permission so I let him know that I am ready to sue him if necessary (he thinks I'm lying about my legal connections, but unfortunately, since I don't know his identity, I cannot serve him). 

Instead he went and made a new post which led to even more bullying. I keep on receiving messages from strangers, who are cursing at me, bullying and harassing me, even sending me death threats. I had to deactivate both my facebook and instagram, but I don't want to go and make a new profile all together for any of those pages because I have many conversations between my brother and I on there. My brother just passed away a month ago from cancer and he was my best friend and I shouldn't have to give up those memories because I'm being harassed.

But the thing is that I keep getting those emails and it's getting pretty annoying, and I reported most of them but I know that Instagram doesn't exactly care about that type of things. So I noticed that there's an option called "" limit the set password emails "" but I don't know what exactly does it do so if you could explain it to me please

I can‚Äôt report their photos because they delete them within a minite of someone reporting them (they usually last up to 10 hours on Instagram before someone reports) , and I can‚Äôt report their accounts because of the lessening of Instagram staff. This is a problem, and I may have to delete Instagram because of this, because I can no longer open it in public and I do not want to see full out nudity in an app such as this. I‚Äôd much rather go to ACTUAL adult sites for that content, in the privacy of my own home. I‚Äôve blocked every page I‚Äôve seen with nudity so far, but the amount of pages posting nudity and taking advantage of the coronavirus forcing Instagram to reduce it‚Äôs staff is spreading, and these porn accounts have tens of  thousands of followers.

fphjqv,DoJo_Mast3r,Instagram hashtag filler words advice?,"Ive been experimenting with how instagram uses hashtags, it seams they no longer like a super long list of hashtags at the end of a caption on hidden in a comment, so I fill my hashtags with junk words between each hashtag, this fools the algo and boosts my posts. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

These hashtags would normally show up like this under my post or in a comment:

&amp;#x200B;

\#ring #cinema4d #octanerender #octane #3dart #design #3dartwork #3drender #digartshare #3d #vfx #maxon #cgi #c4d #devsurf #jewelry #diamond #diamondring #fluid #liquid #silver #color #metalic #beautiful #luxury #jewelgram #weddingring #jewelers #sparkly

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However with my filler it shows up like this:

&amp;#x200B;

(Please ignore this weird sentence)

&amp;#x200B;

Amazing #ring I used in #jewelryvideo and #octanerender with #octane love #design thats why its #ringrender and its all made with #3drender and calculated with #simulation glad I can #digartshare its a #3d object with #vfx thanks to #maxon and #cgi tech #c4d is the best program. The company #devsurf designed this peice of #jewelry it has a huge #diamond on this #diamondring and inside is a #fluid or #liquid that material is #silver with a #color and #metalic that is #beautiful and #luxury only #jewelgram or people who do #weddingring and are #jewelers very #sparkly

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So Im wondering if Im the only one who does this, and also if there is a website/generator to create these filler words for me as its a bit annoying to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Or is this all a waste of time? I heard posting hashtags as a comment on the post can bypass the need for filler words but Im not sure, anyone do any experiments/research?",0,1585249712,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fphjqv/instagram_hashtag_filler_words_advice/,Instagram,1

I'm confused about how ""reach"" works in Instagram.

Two days later (Saturday 6:30 pm) I posted another photo with exactly the same hashtags, which only had a reach of 40 accounts and 44 impressions (36 from starting page, 7 from hashtags, 1 from others). Yesterday (Wednesday 4:35 pm) I again posted another photo which had a reach of only 7 accounts and 7 impressions (only 7 from hashtags).

fp7f5t,jackthompson660,Stuck in an endless loop...,"Hi everyone. Please bare with me as I explain this in an effort to get an account back. 

(I‚Äôm in mobile as of now, apologies for formatting)

This evening I was snooping my Instagram settings and noticed my email was unconfirmed. It‚Äôs at this time I noticed the email also had a typo. So I clicked on it to change it to my actual email. I‚Äôm doing this, it sent a link to the correct email saying the emails had been switched. However, it said it had switched FROM the correct email TO the incorrect email. 

Easy fix I thought. My email was unique to me and my name so I just made a new email with the typo to try and fix it that way. This whole process had removed me from my account on all of my devices. 

I went to reset my password, put in my username, and it sent a ‚Äòreset password‚Äô email to the typo email. But I received it. I thought I was golden. I was wrong. 

Upon resetting my password, I was asked for a ‚Äòsecurity code‚Äô that was supposedly emailed to me. I haven‚Äôt received a single one. 

Instagram‚Äôs FAQs were entirely unhelpful as it directed me to click on ‚Äúneed more help‚Äù on the login page. Doing so only gives me the option to enter a security code sent to, you guessed it, the email with the typo. However, again, no email was received. 

I‚Äôm really frustrated by this and very upset. I‚Äôve had a lot of meaningful conversations on that account and a lot of memories I‚Äôd hate to lose. Unfortunately the memories are in the captions and the people I followed. 


Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far:

‚Ä¢ Sent password reset to the typo email and reset password
 {it accepted new password, but won‚Äôt let me log in because security code}

‚Ä¢clicking ‚Äòneed more help‚Äô
    {redirects me to FAQ and to enter the security code}

I did only get instagram in 2018 though, whereas they got it back in 2014.

I understand how to grow if my instagram had a niche, or belonged to a specific goal or something, eg. engage with others in that niche, follow people in that niche etc. But what about my personal account, which is just photos of myself, my car, motorcycles, and my travel trips etc?  


I've pretty much followed everyone I want to follow that instagram has recommended to me through the 'people you may know' or whatever (mostly people I went to highschool with).

I can't make sense of how some people I know have over 1000 followers, and yet only 20 posts or so, and they only follow 100-500 people. Is this the result of follow/unfollow? Or is there something I'm missing?

I‚Äôm taking to Reddit because some of my friends mentioned I can probably get some solid feedback here. 

On March 6th, 2020, my IPhone account was hacked and my iPhone completely erased. Apple was able to recover my account and thankfully I had a backup from the night before so I lost (roughly) 12 hours worth of texts. No biggie.

BUT here‚Äôs the problem...

I logged into my Instagram account and received the message that my Instagram account had been deleted due to violating terms and conditions. It was not only both interesting but also surprising in that it had been almost a week since I posted anything. 

I know that the hacking of my iCloud and the deleting of my Instagram are connected. I had my Instagram password stored in my ICloud. I also received an email from Instagram showing that my account was logged into a device it didn‚Äôt recognize.

I have reached out multiple times to Instagram and had absolutely not luck in getting a helpful response. SO, I‚Äôm turning here. 

I spent about 5 years compiling my memories and videos into that account (yeah I know I should have had a backup) and now I am not able to access anything on the account. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can fix this?

Is there a way to fix this? It's very frustrating.

fo8sj1,thisiswoooo,Not so secret but not everyone knows advice to grow for beginners,"Okay so basically I run a more personal/fashion page. Obviously going in I knew it would be hard because how oversaturated that area is. However my growth was horrible. My reach and profile visits were pretty good. I was averaging anywhere from 50-80 profile visits a day, which is good for me. My reach was I posted was 50 or so, 30 when I didn‚Äôt. I post usually every other day. 

So what‚Äôs the tip? Well basically only like pictures of things that‚Äôs in your area. For example, if you run a baking page, only like baking videos and only follow baking pages. Ever since I started doing this I‚Äôve gotten more real followers who follow me for my photos rather than for a follow back and I‚Äôm getting way more followers. I‚Äôm also getting more likes from people in my sector as well. To put it in perspective, since midnight I have gained 10 followers. It is currently 1pm. It‚Äôs not much but considering I only have 60 followers it‚Äôs decent. Also, my likes have gotten better. Overall people have been liking all my pictures. 

I did see this tip somewhere on here but I feel as though a lot of people don‚Äôt stress this enough. Not only does it, I‚Äôm assuming, put your content out there more to people in your sector, but it allows you to like and engage with people in that sector more through the explore page which is always a plus. To me, it seems like one of the more important things.",0,1585069883,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fo8sj1/not_so_secret_but_not_everyone_knows_advice_to/,Instagram,1

fo7yqn,The_Nils96,Saving own Story Highlights from Android,"Hey Guys, 

I have a question about saving Story Highlights from Instagram.

On iOS there is this function, that I can one-click save one whole highlight even when it is full (100 stories). It is getting saved as one long continuous clip in my camera roll.

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine wants to save all her highlights from her Android phone but does not have the option. I checked on another android phone and could not find that Icon for saving, too. Are we missing something or is the app actually missing that feature?

Is there else any other possibility of saving it as one clip in total? I've googled today for a long time and found some (web-)apps, but each one that is working, is only able to save either one story-highlight at a time or downloads all of them but not in the correct order (due to naming).

I am very thankful for your tips!

I don't have an influencer account (less than 1K followers) but i did go ""pro"" because I am a data freak, and work in marketing, so love seeing engagements and other kinds of info when I post/put stories up.

Also, I go through my story viewers quite throroughly, and today the usual reparittion changed completely. I am over 185 viewers and the algorithm is supposed to take up and create a repartition based upon what I understood is the number of actions taken between my account and these other users accounts.

due to the current situation, I got time to draw and paint. I am technically not a good drawer/painter but I think my pictures got some nice vibes and aesthetics. Mostly I have fun being creative and I like to share my art. My ‚Äûproblem‚Äú is that I don‚Äòt have one style. Perhaps I‚Äòm going to find it someday, but I actually like doing different stuff with different media. Now my impression is that on Instagram everyone is focused on one style and the accounts with many followers are so consistent. Is it possible to be successful with different styles on one account or are people generally not open to that? Personally I think it‚Äòs interesting to see different styles and media of one person but I sense, that the majority thinks otherwise. Should I give it a try or should I use different accounts? If yes, isn‚Äòt it really time challenging to do so?

fnlh93,DrNIki,[FIX]INSTAGRAM MUSIC ISNT AVAILABLE IN YOUR REGION,"okay, i really wanted to add instagram music, but could not.

 Instagram Music isn't Available In Your Region - Yikes! Music, we all love it and it can really spice up your Instagram story but for some people they are presented with the message that the Instagram music isn‚Äôt available in your region. This becomes a problem if you are the type of page to use a lot of music in your story posts and want to select certain music for your Instagram story but keep on getting this frustrating message. With all that in mind I have the perfect solution for you right in this video. 

The process of how to add music to your Instagram story is a fairly straightforward process, it is provided to you as a sticker and you just need to tap on the sticker icon and then select music. You might think that‚Äôs all good only to find out that the Instagram music isn‚Äôt available in your region, which could mess up the entire vibe that you are trying to achieve with that specific story post.  This Instagram music isn‚Äôt available in your region, messages can pop up whether you are on iPhone or Android and is not based on the type of mobile device that you have, rather it all has to do with where you are living in the world. See Instagram gets the licence for certain music for certain countries and if they don‚Äôt have the licence for a specific song in your country then you are going to be presented with the Instagram music that isn't available in your region message.

After being presented with this frustrating message you might have headed to either Google or YouTube to try and find a solution to this problem and this is why you are watching this video right now. My aim is to shed some light on this matter so you can better understand why you are receiving this message and I outline right in this video all the possible solutions to the Instagram music isn‚Äôt available in your region message. 

It‚Äôs important to be able to use the music that you set out to use when you created your story post. With stories being a more and more prominent feature of Instagram now. More people use stories compared to the traditional feed posts now so being able to post the perfect story is essential for your engagement and growth on Instagram in 2020. Music can play a big part on whether or not someone stays and watches your story or goes ahead and skips right past it. If you have a catchy or popular song people will definitely stay on your story just to listen to the music so being able to select the perfect music for your story posts is vital with the majority of Instagram users consuming stories each and every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you found this video helpful and that it solved your Instagram music isn‚Äôt available in your region. If you have any further questions then you can drop a comment down below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

So I started my Instagram account on November 2019 and for the first 2/3 months they always have put my pictures/videos in hashtags trends and in the Explore page. One of my greatest video made over 100k views on trends (I had 1000 followers at that time). 
But nowadays they rarely put me in trends, and I have the feeling that even my own followers don‚Äôt see my post, I rarely go up to 500 views and I have 3500 followers now.

Why would instagram hide my account now ? I have to say that I never used any bot/service selling followers and I‚Äôm not doing mass following/unfollowing.

Essentially, I'm a candidate in an election for a students union and as such decided to establish an online presence in the form of an Instagram account and Facebook page.

The issue I'm having is that Instagram have restricted me to stop me from publishing captions of any description on posts and throwing up endless errors when I try to follow anyone.

As you can imagine that's far from ideal with voting 2 weeks away. Is there any quick fix or indeed any fix for this issue so that I can continue to canvass/campaign effectively?

yesterday I posted a pic in which I put a lot of effort, but however it had a very limited reach.

Also I only gained 25 impressions through hashtags, while normally it's around 2000-3000 after one day.
I still got a lot of likes and comments right at the beginning, but only from my followers.
I think I'm not shadowbanned, as I can find my posts in the Hashtags search and used a shadowban website. 

Does anyone know what's happening?

I have the assumption that it is maybe because I was very active (but no spam) in the last days and only had 48h between the last two posts.

fmvgir,benmangelsdorf,I need help getting around an error,"Hello, I have an error that I have been trying to find a way around for quite some time. Here is the fully story.

On my phone, I had been logged into two Instagram accounts: 1. my personal account and 2. an account I shared with others. Account #2 got banned, and I was logged out of it. I was still able to use account #1 for months, both on my phone and on my computer.

I then deleted the Instagram app on my phone. I redownloaded it later, and I could no longer log into account #1. It immediately thinks that I am account #2. It displays that I can log in through my Facebook, but that doesn't work, presumably because it was linked to account #2 somehow. Same goes for logging in via account #1's username, email or phone number. I always get the same error message: ""Sorry, there was a problem with your request.""

Now normally I would assume that I just got banned on both or whatever. BUT, I can still log onto account #1 on my computer. I can even log onto account #1 via the Safari app on my phone! 

Obviously the app somehow is remembering me as account #2 and just locking me out. Yet account #1 is obviously not banned. Is there any way to get past this? I am willing to reset my phone or whatever, I just want to be able to use the app again. I've seen this error documented elsewhere online (with solutions), but it's all old and none of the solutions work anymore.

Hope I get an answer I like or I have some explaining to do. I used a program on my computer called Video DownloadHelper to download one of my old ex's Instagram Stories (I used a friend's account so they wouldn't know it was me).  And a day or so later my ex's profile is private. Would Instagram have measures in place to notify them? (Ie that my friend's account used a program to download it). Or did my ex just see that someone they don't know viewed their story and decided to make their account private?

Now, the content that is there is something I dont exactly want to be public (its not nudes or anything dont get interested, just some shittalking and shitposting) (and thats the whole issue, i dont give a hell about these accounts but like 3k post that were private are now public and everybody can dig into them) and i tried the procedure again but now i cant even get to the page to fill my email, it simply redirects me to the absolutely worthless instagram help center which offers literally zero help.

fmqwls,SqueakRaps,Account Disabled for Violating Terms.,"Okay, so I did violate the terms around a year ago by using everliker for about 2 months, but I got a warning from Instagram and I stopped as I didn't want to lose my account. I also send my friends links to music I'm working on pretty consistently so I believe that was the reason I was banned, I already emailed instagram, but I was wondering if anyone had any more info on this? 

Will the algorithm treat my account differently after this? 

Do I need to do anything other than email them with a picture of me and all that?

Should I just make a new account if this account is now at risk of being banned again?

How long till my account will be unlocked?

My instagram account is my main way of marketing to people that enjoy my music so I can't afford to lose this account later on.

fmkrru,curate-hashtags,Personalized hashtag statistics on Instagram while you browse via a Chrome Extension,"Often times Instagram itself is the best place to go to find inspiration for your own content creation. Even more so when it comes to selecting niche hashtags to use on your posts.

When it came time to finding new hashtags for any of my accounts, this was my general approach:

* Go to Instagram in my browser on my laptop
* Pick a single hashtag that was relevant to my Instagram account and go to that hashtag's page
* Click on posts that I liked, see what hashtags they used and open any of the potential hashtags that I may want to use in a new tab.
* I would also see if there were any decent ones in the Related Hashtags section and open any that seemed like they had potential in a new tab.

After a while, I would have a ton of tabs open with hashtags to use.

Going through each tab, I would make sure the hashtag was actually relevant to my content, check the post count, make sure it wasn't shadowbanned, etc. This system worked pretty well and allowed me to intentionally select the best hashtags for any content on Instagram that I produced.

There were some problems though‚Ä¶ üò©

* When I found hashtags that I thought were good to use I would have to copy/paste them into a spreadsheet or planning tool to keep track of.
* I didn't know which hashtags were ones I had already used or were brand new to me. There were simply too many to keep track of.

fmkqja,curate-hashtags,Personalized hashtag statistics on Instagram while you browse via a Chrome Extension üéÅ,"Often times Instagram itself is the best place to go to find inspiration for your own content creation. Even more so when it comes to selecting niche hashtags to use on your posts.

When it came time to finding new hashtags for any of my accounts, this was my general approach:

* Go to Instagram in my browser on my laptop
* Pick a single hashtag that was relevant to my Instagram account and go to that hashtag's page
* Click on posts that I liked, see what hashtags they used and open any of the potential hashtags that I may want to use in a new tab.
* I would also see if there were any decent ones in the Related Hashtags section and open any that seemed like they had potential in a new tab.

After a while, I would have a ton of tabs open with hashtags to use.

Going through each tab, I would make sure the hashtag was actually relevant to my content, check the post count, make sure it wasn't shadowbanned, etc. This system worked pretty well and allowed me to intentionally select the best hashtags for any content on Instagram that I produced.

There were some problems though‚Ä¶ üò©

* When I found hashtags that I thought were good to use I would have to copy/paste them into a spreadsheet or planning tool to keep track of.
* I didn't know which hashtags were ones I had already used or were brand new to me. There were simply too many to keep track of.
* If I was trying to find a certain number of hashtags for a post, I didn't know which hashtags I had already selected to use and how many I had collected.
* I was unsure how much I was using the same hashtags over and over again and how much I was varying my hashtag selection.

I made a post yesterday, you can check out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fm2bl2/log_in_issue/) so I don't have to go into all over again, so you can see what I'm dealing with. 

I'm writing again because I've exhausted all options I could think of on my end to deal with this. I've restarted my phone numerous times, I've deleted and reinstalled the app numerous times, I've tried to login in from a desktop, and I even tried to create a new account so I could contact Instagram through the app itself (since that seems to be the only way to really reach them), and not even that worked! I was logged out for suspicious activity before I was even truly logged in. I've been monitoring what other people are saying or have said over the last month or so...that combined with what just happened with the new account suggests to me that the app is clearly having some sort of major problem or bug going on that they still have yet to fully resolve. 

I just wanted to know if anyone else on here was experiencing something like this? Is there anything else you've tried? Or even just for more peace of mind, frankly, that it's not too singular of an issue. I've never had this happen before and I don't really know what to do.

Oh how wrong was I. A few *weeks* later one of my students asks why did I drop my instagram. I didn't. She says she doesn't see my posts anymore and my profile is empty, almost like a blacklist. 

So we take her phone and we go to my profile and it really is empty, but there's a disclaimer at the bottom that you should be at least one year old to view this profile. Like, what? She tinkers with it a bit and it let's her in, she sees my profile again in the feed.

I changed my 'minimum age' to 'default', because you can't just disable it, but from that moment I'm still not sure if some people may not see my account. It was such a stupid thing and I basically discovered it by accident, and if someone following me stopped seeing the profile, it probably means that it didn't show *anywhere*. 

I'm not even sure what to do about it, I didn't know instagram 'had' an age somewhere and forced you to state you're over X to view certain content. I hope it doesn't do that for 'default' settings.

fm9iyv,RaisedByTheInterweb,Good reach but only got 1 new follower. Flawed stat?,"One of my post got a pretty good reach compare to the others. For once, the hashtags got me over 1200 impressions outside of my followers. It's nice, but according to the stats, 13 visited my profile (overall i.e. including my followers) and I only got 1 new follow. Which seems quite low.

I did received a few new followers (10) since I posted though. I can't tell if it's because of this post or because of some other reasons (followchain, link from other social media...).

So here is my question: Is that possible that this stat about the followers gained on the post is flawed? Maybe it only counts people who follow the account just after visiting the profile? Like for example, if someone open the profile, visiting it slowly, open a few posts and then follow, maybe it's not counted?

flr4ci,Fliperaci,Returning from social media hiatus and at a loss - looking for an IG guru for a personal acc! (DM me if interested in working on it)," 

here's the challenges/straight facts:

* 100 followers (took a 3 year hiatus from social)
* not a hyper specific community I'm trying to target, because I'm sort of a dynamic dude! lol don't know how to describe this, but for example:
   * I played college soccer
   * I surf, learning to kitesurf now,
   * I'm learning surf photography just for fun but not really wanting to share a lot of that
   * All the businesses that I consult with are ""conscious"" aka just genuinely trying to help people
   * I travel and work remote full-time but sort of despise how the ""digital nomad"" thing has commoditized and glamorized the lifestyle
   * I'm an entrepreneur (I own an ecom business, a small consultancy, and a service based business, and I'm involved with impact investing) but again, I hate what this label has become :((
   * I don't really like drinking/partying! fml, genuinely wish I enjoyed drinking like I used to
   * I'm in pretty damn good shape (was a personal trainer for like 6 years before I went into digital), but again, even seeing #fitfam in a post makes me want to puke
* personal account, not trying to push a product or grow a business (workload is super solid, and IG is not the place I'd be trying to pull biz from)

So, I have some recent professional photography that I was in for a recent behind-the-scenes shoot of a brand I'm working on, and I want to post it and tag the relevant people BUT I want to buy like 200-300 followers just so it's not weird how many followers I have. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I crazy? 

Or should I just roll with it and hope for the best?",0,1584690568,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/flr4ci/returning_from_social_media_hiatus_and_at_a_loss/,Instagram,1

flqwgw,Mystica-AriYena,Old issue but still need help - create instagram account,"Hi, first time poster here and I hope you'll be able to help me out.   
I'm having the same kind of issue that I've seen other Reddit users have when I do a search, but I can't find a way to solve the problem despite of that.   
I tried making an instagram account using my facebook account (it said I can do that, even seems to prefer it).   


When putting in the email it says username does not belong to an account.   
I tried to create a new account, using that same email and then it says: email already linked to an account.   
So I then tried to recover the password on that email linked account and then it says 'another account is using that email address'.   


Help? I can't find a way to contact them. I saw other users sending a mail to them but I don't find contact information anywhere.   


With this social distancing thing various organisations that I need are using instagram so I kind of need it now.   


Thank you for whatever help you can provide.

I did notice how good her English was, fairly fluent with very few mistakes, even that Americans make

Today I asked her where she learned to speak English? and she said she didn't remember, which sounded very suspicious (I had only asked casually as part of an ongoing convo)

I then asked her to write my name on a piece of paper and take a picture of her holding it and she acted confused by the request and wouldn't do it

Then suddenly I noticed her status and other Instagram items were in her language, not English, so I wondered whether Instagram has some kind of translator for DMs, and if she had turned it off. Maybe she wanted me to think she was speaking English to me and didn't want me to know she was using a translator, was the most innocent interpretation I could think of

Otherwise, I'm in a total scam by what seemed like a nice girl. I haven't given her anything so I'm still ok on my end

flf68f,spazmodium,Confusion About Tagged Photos,"Hi all, 

I'm trying to figure out the nuances of tagged photos but I'm confused and hoping someone can explain more clearly than the Instagram help page.  My account it public, but my girlfriend's is private.  When she tags me in a photo, and it shows up on my profile, who exactly can see it?  

According to Instagram's help page, I'm reading two contradictory things.  On the tagger's side (her), ""If your Instagram account is private, only your approved followers can see the photo or video.""  From the taggee's side (me), ""Who can see these [tagged photos] on your profile depends on your visibility settings.""  I read those two statements in conflict with each other, i.e. anyone can see my public profile and all photos where I am tagged but only her followers can see her photos including the ones where I am tagged.  Am I reading it wrong?  

What this ultimately comes down to is I have some family members who I follow and follow me that I don't necessarily want to be all up in my business.  They're very nice people but also very nosy and opinionated and I just don't want to deal with it.  I don't want to tell my gf to stop tagging me if these people who don't follow her can't see the photos.  

I hope that made sense.  Thanks for any help!",1,1584643176,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/flf68f/confusion_about_tagged_photos/,Instagram,1

Also, I had a question about sharing content. I watched a few videos on the subject on YouTube and took note that some people gain a following by cycling content that has been made by others. That seemed sketchy to me. I'm aware that you give credit to the original source and all. But, yeah. Murky water to me. Also, what the hell is a carousel, and how do I make one?

fl1z6t,littlesj99,How long did it take for you guys to hear back from Instagram Support?,"Hey y'all,

So last week I had to get a new phone because my charger port was not working anymore and I was down to 4% so I frantically zoomed over to the apple store and bought a new phone. I've had no trouble recovering any of my other social media accounts except for instagram. I have the two-factor authentication set up and I have my phone number linked to the account so I thought okay cool, I didn't have the back up codes for the duo mobile app but I still have the same phone number. So I went ahead and had the code sent over to my phone. I never received it. I tried multiple times to get it sent to my phone number and still, nothing. I can't even get a code sent to my e-mail which I find ridiculous but whatever. So I eventually ended up contacting support and I e-mailed them roughly like 10 times. I received a response from them titled: ""Instagram 2Fac Support"" on March 12th. Basically the e-mail asked me to identify myself by sending in a photo holding a sheet of paper with a code they gave me along with my full name and instagram username. So I was thrilled I got a response and immediately sent a photo of myself holding the piece of paper doing exactly what the e-mail told me to do. It's been about 6 days now and I haven't heard back from them again. How long did it take for you guys to hear back from them? Should I wait a little longer or should I email them again? Have any of you had this issue and how long did it take for you to recover your account?

If your account was disabled due to copy write infringement or was was disabled willingly by the owner (in settings) I CANNOT help. All other ban reasons I can assist. We‚Äôve recovered over 100 accounts in the last month. 

Cost is $20 and we‚Äôll continuously appeal daily using multiple methods so that iG does not detect you are spam or a bot; if you spam IG and don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing you can be permabanned, that won‚Äôt happen with us.

However, if I post a meme or more standard photos to Instagram, and then share to Facebook, it always defaults my Facebook post to friends only. That means that friends of mine who want to share have to ask for it to be changed to public, and while I can manually switch it over on Facebook the process becomes time consuming after a while. 

I've been looking through my facebook and instagram settings on both my phone and computer and nothing seems to change this, and all of the tutorials online that I can find are from 3-5 years ago, seemingly all of the settings and privacy options have changed since then.

But ever since this morning both through the preview app or going directly to Instagram I can't upload an image to my feed that originates in Dropbox. It says image cannot be uploaded and closes out back to the image selection showing the images that are just stored on my phone.

I've also tried using the share feature through the Dropbox app and that doesn't work. I can use any of those methods to send it to my story but not to my feed. Any possible ideas?

fkk1ju,synthboxx,instagram not showng me an account??,"okay so. this is long-winded but here i go.

i've followed this one account on Instagram for god knows how long on my main account. 

earlier, i was just messing around on my art/side account and saw they liked a post of mine and i was like ""oh hey wonder what theyre up to"" so i switch to my main for some reason, and i see that they just. dont exist on my main account. 

i go to view my side account's post from my main, and i can't see that person's username in the likes. weird, they must have only one of my accounts blocked or something. so i kessage them on my side acc to ask, and they said they dont have my blocked and i didnt have them blocked, but they can't see my main either, but we can both see each other's main from our side accounts. we've tried everything we can think of.

we dont show up in each other's main followers/following tab, we dont show up in searches and even sending a link of the other to our main from our side doesnt allow us to see each other.

Is a simple double-tap to like, and private message of gratitude not enough? Or maybe just another way to brag to your instagram followers: Hey look! It's my birthday!

I now follow more than 500 people.  Mostly good content.  So I don't mind seeing it.  But I can't keep up!  I like supporting the people I follow but I can't be spending so much at it. 

So I'm thinking of muting people who don't interact with me.

Why not unfollow them?  I could, and have in the past.  But I don't want to be that guy with a lopsided follower/following ratio.  e.g. 1000 followers but is following only 50 people.

Does Instagram allow users to create pages that pretend to honor the memory of someone who died tragically with the sole intent of profiteering off the incident? I have come across a page that explicitly mentions promoting things on the page due to the number of followers present, though they only garnered that following by posting countless intimate pictures of a young lady immediately after her tragic death. This seems unethical in every respect, but there was no accurate report option that encapsulated what that page is doing. The question, simply put, is: does this in any way violate the terms of service Instagram sets forth for users to abide by? If so, how does on go about making sure this page no longer exists?

fju60u,DollarStoreTonyStark,Should I convert my growing personal account to a meme / brand account and lose my 'identity' or try and start the meme / brand account from scratch?,"I have a dilemma I can't wrap my head around and want some advice. 

I have a personal Instagram, Let's call it JonDoe that goes with my personal twitter, where I am the brand as a streamer/youtuber. It's all growing very well, and I have over 1k on insta, growing daily, but I want to rebrand it to my streamer brand name and start posting more funny/meme content. 

I figured I'd just start a new personal JonDoe account for family, friends, girlfriend, etc and run with the momentum on my converted brand account (don't eff with momentum, right?)

My only hangup, is that I would basically lose all my personal history on my me-as-a-brand account.

7 years of history or so, just buried under all the content.

So then, the obvious solution of course, is if I think my brand is strong enough, keep my main account as my personal one, and start fresh, completely from scratch with my brand account. 

But then I'm worried it will take months, or even a year, to build up that brand to the following and moment I have now if I start from scratch.

**tl;dr:**

**So should I just use the momentum, take the plunge, make the dive into cold water, rip off the bandaid, and rebrand JonDoe to my BRAND, burying all my personal history, and create a separate family and friends account for that going forward? Or keep my JonDoe account personal and try and build my brand completely from scratch?**",3,1584399087,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fju60u/should_i_convert_my_growing_personal_account_to_a/,Instagram,1

fj4yw9,jakkumanichita,Instagram Posts and Stories (picture and vid) are significantly worst in Android compared to iPhone,"I have an LG G7 and my camera shoots pretty good images. But everytime I upload something to my Instagram page or my stories, the image quality drops super significantly.
Now I understand instagram has limitations for both Android and iPhone. Compression is completely necessary when having such a big social media like that. But the compression on my android is 30x worst then on my friend's iPhone.
I tried many things to try to get around this like downloading InstaPro which is another instagram application and uploading from there instead, but that didn't do anything. I tried resizing the images manually to 1024x1024p but when I uploaded it, the compression made it even worst then before. I tried changing the DPI of the image down to 150 and to 72 but that didn't change anything either. It all just looks super pixelated and blurry, like if I was taking a photo from a flip phone.
And stories.. holy f***, it cannot get any worst then stories quality, specially in video quality. If I take a boomerang on an iPhone, it's nice and seem-less and smooth, but on the android it looks like you're using the webcam from the 70s to take your video. I am aware that instagram for Android isn't optimized like for iPhone and captures your screen while using the camera instead of just using the camera, like taking a screenshot of your camera app for example, but that doesn't explain why uploading a high quality picture to post to your page becomes so bad on Android compared to iPhone.
Majority of big celebrities are using their iPhones and their posts are of a really high quality, you can zoom in forever.
So to sum it up, why is the quality so bad on Android when posting compared to iPhone? 
Is it just on my LGG7 that this is happening?
And is there any way to get around this? Both for posting and stories",0,1584293500,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fj4yw9/instagram_posts_and_stories_picture_and_vid_are/,Instagram,1

Facebook already have this functionality in the Timeline Feature of a selected account wherein I can specify the month or year within the settings to start searching for any content(posted and tagged photos and videos). For example, I selected 2013 within the Timeline then I can also specify which month of 2013 to start searching downwards for any content. I would also like the Instagram to have that feature.

The fact of the matter is this is not cheap. The amount of work that has to be done makes it pricey. But if anyone is interested I can get it done for you guaranteed. 

I will only accept PayPal goods and services. So that it protects me and you! 

Turnaround time depends on your niche but never takes more than 15 days.

The only thing I can think is that I posted a price or maybe someone reported me just being a jerk. 


If I pay for an ad I can get my normal traction but it's a hassle to get Instagram to agree, stating that my website (rogueapparatus.etsy.com - and Etsy page) is attempting to sell firearms weapons or ammo, which isn't allowed on Etsy... So uhhh... Yeahhhhhhh

The account has 25 posts. I haven't noticed any unusual likes or comments. This evening at around 10:30 Pacific Time, a gigantic wave of fake followers rolled in. In 30 minutes I gained over a hundred followers. They are all very fake -- names like xhosireohlsjhf12, accounts with 0 posts that are following 4000 people, accounts that are super-creepy because it's obvious they used to be legitimate accounts year ago, but now they've been hacked. 

Speaking of hacking, I did check my activity to see if \_I\_ had been hacked, but my account has not been doing anything strange. 

I know how to remove them, so I'm going to do that. Any ideas about why this is happening, and if there's anything I can do to prevent it?",0,1584166374,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fie2fi/in_the_past_hour_a_hundred_fake_accounts_followed/,Instagram,1

fidnqt,medka_103,"Pls, I need someones opinion on this!!","So, there is this guy that I had a small crush on for years and I genuinely think he knows because someone asked him if he would like to go out with me, but he rejected not because he wasn't interested, he rejected because we live very far from each other(insanely far lol). Anyways, today he posted something on his story which was interesting and I wanted to share that with my sibling. So, I opened his story again to show what I was talking about and exited his story, and ig ofc. After a few minutes, I pick up my phone and logged into ig again and I saw in the corner that I got a notification. I wondered who might have sent me a text, so when I pressed the arrow, I saw his profile that was bolded which means that its a msg that I haven't opened. When I saw this I immediately said to myself ""this is a lie. There is nooo way that he had messaged me"". So I pressed on the chat and I saw nothing! I pressed back, and refreshed the chat screen and his profile disappeared. Now, was this an instagram glitch? Because it really does look and sound surreal that he might have sent me a message then deleted it .. I don't know if this happened to anyone before. This is why I would want someone to give me their opinion on this entire thing.",2,1584163882,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fidnqt/pls_i_need_someones_opinion_on_this/,Instagram,1

fi71wm,15November2019,The fact that there's no warning that you're about to block someone on Android is just ridiculous.,"So, lately I've been using Instagram's chat more and more due to some reasons, and I can't stop but think how easy it is to block someone's account by mistake. How? Well it depends on how you hold your phone, in my case I hold it like [this](https://i.imgur.com/tcOmW8U.jpg), and as you can see the very tip of my left index finger touches the upper corner of the screen, where coincidentally there's also a the ( i ) button, or whatever name it has.   


Now once you press that by mistake, you might also be in mid typing with your thumbs and accidentaly press the ""Block Account"" button which is right where the keyboard is on the chat window.   
Now of course this should not be an issue cause you could always press ""Cancel"" when the ""Are you sure you want to block your girlfriend and get her mad"" pop-up comes on...  


Except there is no f\*ucking warning! Nothing! You just block people like you're breaking records or whatsoever.  Mindblowing  


There's no way nobody else complained about this, I can't be the only one to hold the phone like that (that I know for sure cause there are stock images of people holding it like that) and accidentally blocks people, is it really that hard to implement a warning pop-up?",0,1584134363,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fi71wm/the_fact_that_theres_no_warning_that_youre_about/,Instagram,1

I've been running an instagram page for a while now and I'm trying to improve it. I'm trying to increase its success (increase followers and likes, comments, interactions). 

\- I got interested in my community by subscribing and linking via comments, likes, private messages etc. I'm trying to improve it. I really interacted a lot on instagram with my subscribers, my subscriptions and everyone else too. 

\- I also improved the feed by making the pictures more attractive and cool but also in its entirety by creating a continuity, a conductive feel, a theme.

\- I also post stories, trying to ask questions, engaging in conversation etc.

\-The photos I've been posting lately have been a big success: a lot of likes, comments, DM, reposts of our photos by influences etc..

But with all this, the followers don't increase!  I've been following all advices and doing everything possible and my whole team is giving it its all ! It's so frustrating and I'm so invested in it.

fi0eyh,ashcammy,"Instagram Hacked! Help me find Instagram thief and tell them they suck! Username/email changed, no idea what my new username now is, and I‚Äôm afraid the account is lost forever.","Hi all,

My instagram account was recently hacked. The name was @cauldronblessed. It is not my main account or anything (I still have my main account), mainly it was just my backup account, I had pictures of Cole Sprouse and fandom related content. I used it mainly to interact with people anonymously. I‚Äôm sort of internet shy. I would hate it if someone I knew irl saw I was commenting on some post or something. I find it cringe, it‚Äôs mainly why I had this second account. 

Butttttt that is besides the point.

MY PROBLEM: I recently commented on a post and it got 6000 likes (my comment), and then after that I‚Äôm pretty certain someone stole my account. I had about 100 followers, I don‚Äôt know any of them personally, like at all. I never even followed anyone I knew. So I have no idea how to find my account; especially as someone changed the username! It is no longer @cauldronblessed! 

HOWEVER I do remember some posts I have commented on where I received a lot of likes and comments. So, I went to those meme pages or whatever where I commented, BUT those comments are gone. I at least thought I could see what my new username would be that this dickhead had changed it too. BUT HOW did he/she delete all my comments on every post I commented on?? It‚Äôs really bugging me.

I literally remember about 4 different accounts I commented on with @cauldronblessed and my comments are no longer there. And I don‚Äôt quite understand why! If this person just changed my account name shouldnt my comments still be there? I don‚Äôt quite get it. 

Did he/she just steal my account, only to delete it? Why would someone do that? I thought maybe they stole it cause I hade 100 followers. But all my comments where gone, so did this person just steal my account to delete it? What does he/she want with it? Ngl it‚Äôs really bugging me. 

What was he/she‚Äôs motive? Why do people hack into other peoples accounts and steal it? If I just had 3 measly Cole Sprouse posts and 100 followers. Can someone please explain WHY someone would want to steal/hack into that?????? 

Mainly i‚Äôm pissed, not at the fact that I lost my account. I had like 3 posts and spent minimal time on it, it means nothing to me. No, I‚Äôm pissed that someone had the audacity to hack into MY account and steal it from me. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be triggered (like it‚Äôs whatever and doesn‚Äôt effect my life in any way) but I am lol. I just wanna find the person and tell him/her to go fuck themselves for stealing my account. Yes, I am petty like that.

I should probably get a life I know. But oh well. 

What I also want to know is if there is any possible way to find my account? Im pretty sure the dickhead changed my email too, so I don‚Äôt know what to do in that regard. 

I just can‚Äôt let this guy win by having my account. He/she stole it bruv. Like who does that? Tf. He/she is a thief and does not deserve my account! I mean i‚Äôm not entirely sure I do as well, I did just use it to anonymously comment on other people‚Äôs posts. BUT STILL, I am holding a massive grudge to this thief. If you are the thief and you somehow are reading this, I wish nothing but the absolute worst for you. (I DID say I was petty lol). 

Please does anyone have any tips as to what to do and as to WHAT happened??? Like why I cant even find any of my comments on posts I commented with @cauldronblessed.

Peaked at 256. Then one day I apparently offended someone or violated some unseen rule. My posts now rarely break 70 likes, even with extra thought and effort and improved editing. My content has gotten better but views are way down. Stories struggle to get 50 views, whereas I used to get several hundred. Have read multiple articles on shadowban, blocked hashtags, etc...most of which say focus on your content, engage with other accounts and the followers will come. Done and done. No change. Latest post I checked all hashtags, none are blocked, but sure enough my post is only visible to followers, not under hashtags. It's literally just me doing pushups and dips with my 2 yr old on my back.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a business page and lately 3 people have complained that we blocked them from seeing ou profile. I think they don't even receive our DMs. We haven't blocked or restricted anyone. Bothe lists are blank and when we visit their profile there is no option to unblock them. I can't find anything on the Internet about this. The block seems to be permanent. Probably more people have been blocked without us knowing and we are worried it might be affecting our business.

Does anyone know anything about this?

We reveal all the advice for having perfect armpits!

The armpit area is fragile.¬†The skin is very thin and the hairs very thick.¬†It is therefore useful to prepare your skin well before and after hair removal.¬†

Today when I logged into my IG account I saw a content removal notification. The content that was posted was reported, and removed, but then the original owner was contacted and the content is restored.

I still see a page stating these:

 

&gt;We Removed Content You Posted  
&gt;  
&gt;We've removed or disabled access to content that you posted on Instagram because a third party reported that the content infringes or otherwise violates their rights.  
&gt;  
&gt;To learn more and to view the content that was removed, please visit:

And there is a single checkbox.

&gt; I acknowledge that I have viewed the content that was removed on my account.

I check the chockbox, and submit (press OK button). The page gets refreshed, with a red warning message at top. Stating:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Select a valid choice. 0 is not one of the available choices. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe this vital bug is an app breaker for people experiencing the same issue. As we can't pass this page, there is no way to ""report a problem"" or contact IG support in any way. Therefore, this seems to be the only channel to report this problem.

fgvrx1,curate-hashtags,Hashtags aren‚Äôt dead‚Ä¶ Instagram just changed the game without anyone noticing ü§ì,"Today, you see so many Instagram users claim ""hashtags don't work anymore"" or ""hashtags are dead."" These days it seems that hashtags work half the time or even not at all. It's like our views that come from hashtags are completely random. We know Instagram is changing its algorithm but it's too hard to keep up. With all the unexplained behavior it's easy to write off using hashtags on Instagram but‚Ä¶

I promise hashtags are as valuable as ever. üèÜ

In fact, because hashtag strategies on Instagram have become more complex and harder to understand if you know how to wield them then you way ahead of the curve. Unlocking their full potential and increasing your reach via hashtags can be what takes your brand to the next level.

There are *two fundamental changes* that Instagram made to their app recently that affect how we should be using hashtags. Understanding the motivation behind why Instagram implemented these changes is key to how you can use them to your advantage.

fgv196,gwynethbluepearl,Instagram Personal vs Creator vs Business,"I can't seem to get a straight answer on this, and did testings on all 3 with no concrete results. I have multiple accounts, personal &amp; business.

Let's take my personal CAR account, which i post photos of my car (once, daily, same time). I have 36.6K followers, all fans of the Make/model of my car. 

***(Skip to the bottom for my main question)***

I started off as a personal public page, and had steady growth/likes, I then switched to business, where the growth remained the same for a while, until it suddenly dropped. Less new followers, less likes (from average of 1,000 likes to 200). 

I read about IG/Facebook focusing on having business accounts to pay for promos, and i thought that made sense. Want you to pay to get that reach. 

So i switched back to personal public, and growth/likes improved as it was before. Then Creator mode was released. I tried that, and same issues with business profile exposure. The same happened to my business page.

I don't believe the insights section, for example the best times to post are not as stated. I had to figure out myself on the best peak, which i stick with daily.

**The Questions: (and i've done many readings - nothing solid)**

\-As a page for just posts of my car, for fun, for fans, not profit - What's the best profile (personal or creator) ?

fgtgzm,real_g0sub,"Scam? Received a ""free giveaway Nintendo Switch""","So out of nowhere a gaming profile with 1k followers wrote me a message saying ""**We picked up your profile from our friend list** *(I wasn't in their following or followers)* **and decided to do a free giveaway of a brand new Nintendo Switch Lite**"". Usually, afaik, in these type of contests you need to like the picture, share it with friends and tag them and stuff like that. I did literally nothing, I didn't even know that profile was existing.

So I faked the bait and said ""Ok, thank you, but I live in XXX so I think shipping will be expensive"". Their reply ""We ship internationally, you only need to PayPal us 25$""

Then I wrote ""Let's make this way: you ship me the console and then I pay you on PayPal"".

They asked me if I am 18+ (""**because we attach a copy of LA Noire so we must know if you're 18+**""), and declined the pre-payment from me, because ""T**his is how it works, you pay first, then we ship**"".

I am not stupid, one thing I know for sure is no one gives you free stuff for nothing. So I ask you, is this a scam, should I report them or just ignore?

I was also thinking: in the remote case of me loosing braincells and becoming stupid and I pay them 25$, I can always open a dispute on PayPal and say I didn't get the stuff. But maybe they use a tracking code of a empty box sent me at my address to prove the shipment, so PayPal trusts the vendor and I get scammed anyway.

fgsfq9,Usernamechexout54,New fan page looking for advice,"Planning and building content to launch  a fan page for a book that's on hiatus.

Very niche market with strong fan base.  There are a few existing  accounts that didn't make it very far in terms of followers and they were more repost accounts.  Because of the hiatus, they've become pretty inactive.

Hoping to build up enough content that when the hiatus is over, fans will eventually find my acct when they begin searching.

Looking for advice on types of original content.  So far, I'm breaking it down into the following...

1.  Engagement-polls, quotes, contests, memes, trivia...

2.  Feature/showcase-fanart+artists, book stores, fans, fellow bloggers, cosplayers...

I'm building a blog site as well to mirror content and possibly tease/x-promo across platforms...hopefully build revenue thru ads and sponsored posts once I build up the audience.

Any advice from anyone who has done something similar would help.

fgr6r8,pctsolutions,Very Weird Instagram Problem...,"Hey guys, this might be a lengthy post so I apologize in advance but I woke up this morning to a very weird Instagram issue. I have over 73,000 followers, I am stating this because it might be relevant. Anyways, this morning I go to log into my Instagram and it is asking for a identity Phone Verification code. Problem is, the phone number they have listed is not mine. It's a phone number in China. Of course I think I have been hacked. I go through the whole process of reporting the hack to Instagram, received the automated email and replied back with questions to all their answers.  


Throughout the day today as I am waiting for Instagram to get back to me I am trying everything I can think of to get access back to my account. Anyhow what I discovered was that if I go to a device where I haven't logged into my Instagram before and go through the procedure to try and reset my account both my proper email AND phone number are available options. I select my phone and I get the verification code. Well, right after I enter the verification code it asks me to change my password, which I do and then I get taken to the identity phone verification screen with that Chinese number. I mean what the hell is going on???  


Another weird thing is I never received an email notification overnight that someone logged into my account as I do whenever I log into Instagram. So I am really wondering was I hacked or is this an Instagram technical problem? My page is not disabled or blocked. I can log into another account and see it just fine. I just don't have access to it. I don't have a clue where this unauthorized Chinese number came from. It doesn't show up on the list of contact options when I use a new device to try to retrieve my account so I am truly baffled.  


I would really love your guys opinions, ideas on what in the world could possibly be going on because I am stumped. It doesn't make logical sense. Does anyone know if Instagram responds to these issues after a certain time of the day or do the bots go home? Thanks in advance and again I apologize for the lengthy post but there was no other way to properly explain this bizarre situation.",1,1583899333,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fgr6r8/very_weird_instagram_problem/,Instagram,1

fgl5ql,Emsm109,Friend‚Äôs profile often disapppears - reasons?,"This has happened couple of times already and I wonder the reason. I am her follower and like to see how‚Äôs she doing every couple of days because she is active traveler. She is not my follower, if that matters.

Basically what happens is that occasionally I am not able to find her profile from instagram at all. But I know it exists because the numbers of my following lists make sense, she is just hidden. Other fact that confirms she being hidden is that I know she is following some my mutual friends. Let‚Äôs say that my particular mutual friend are being followed by profile X plus 6 others, but I can only see 6 mutual friends so she must be 7th one. Then couple of days after her profile appears back like nothing happened. I wonder the reasons for this to be happening, I think some of you have noticed the same effect. I don‚Äôt dare to ask her for obvious reasons.

Here are some of my speculations.

1. She got temporarily banned for some reason (for what?)

3. She somehow edited her to be hidden temporarily (how?)

4. Instagram got bugged (I doubt it because happened two times already and only for her case)

5. Something else, any suggestions?

fgl11f,travlight24,Someone keeps on reporting my own profile picture on IG and it gets deleted,"Hi,

I want to have a picture of me with my 2 kids on IG though my ex, who has been blocking me from any contact with my kids for 2 years, or someone close to her, reports it every single time.

I know I could have my account private, but it's my profile picture and I want my children to being able to see the picture in case they're looking for me.  
IG sends me a message that someone reported 'one' of my pictures and a few days later it gets deleted.

The email doesn't give any possibility to appeal the decision. 

Does anyone know anyway to appeal, report this abuse or have my pictures blocked? Or any contact at IG? My kids are below 13 (I know that's important for IG)

I haven't been able to find any.

All I hope is having this bullying to end and restore contact with my kids.

fgfbkn,magicwishingwell,"""Suspicious Login"" Lockout Help","Hey everyone, I need advice as I'm in a lockout pickle with app crashing on Android and no way to log in on [instagram.com](https://instagram.com).

The short story is I reset my phone quite a bit and have received ""Suspicious Logins"" a couple times after logging back in. Out of marketing/big data privacy concerns and maybe a little paranoia and anxiety (Hello, 2020 and Black Mirror prior), **I only use an spare email address and no phone number for account maintenance and login**. No connected Facebook or other accounts either. This used to work fine until last night.

I just traded in and got a new phone, a Note 10. Brand shiny and new, I go and sign into the Instagram app as usual. Predictably, I get the ""Suspicious Login"" screen and the ability to be sent a 6 digit code to my email. I go to my email, find the code, and when I go back to my phone I find that the Instagram app has frozen and after 5 seconds it crashes and quits.

Going back into Instagram I see the login screen again. I attempt to log in and this time **it shows the suspicious login without any ability to enter a code--just a ""go to the help page website"".**

I go to the webpage and don't see anywhere to submit a support ticket. I go back to my email and decide to hit ""reset password"" in the 6-digit security code email. It takes me to the page where I enter in my username, and then I enter it in to receive an email.

My spare email address that 30 mins ago received the account 6-digit pin email looks somewhat like this for reference: t\*\*\*\*e@mascot.college.edu  
The password reset page said something like, ""password reset email sent to t\*\*\*\*e@e\*\*.com

None of this makes any sense to me, and seems like a combination of errors and the like (and probably a testament to use my main email and phone number tied to the account, marketing insights be damned). Have any of you experienced something like this? Do any of you know what I should do to remedy this situation? (wait 3 days or so before attempting to log in again, etc?) My account is private so I'm not worried about that, but I'm a fairly private person and don't have any stalkers or anyone trying to steal my account that I know of.

fg6us4,MpasMpas,Any advice (Instagram)," 

Hi everyone! I'm a little bit confused and would love if anyone could help me.

I've created an Instagram Meme Page(music memes in particular).

It's basically a new account since I only uploaded 12 photos(one each day)[.](https://posts.my/)

Yesterday one of the memes had a lot of reach: I reached 9,200 accounts,had 600+ likes,35 comments and 105 people saved it and 85 shared it.

The bad thing is that I only have 5 followers... So my question would be: would you recommend me to start following people so that they would follow me back? And in that way I think the people that visit my profile would be more likely to follow me since they see that I have a decent amount of followers(and not only five hahaha) FYI I dont follow anyone.

Thanks so much!

fg25hw,boevemuts,Instagram followers and posts suddenly disappeared ?!,"Hi Redditors,

Last week something odd happened to my instagram (business) account.

First off, last Friday my account completely disappeared. It didn't show up under any the accounts that I managed. I couldn't login either, so I requested a password reset and suddenly the account 'reappeared' yesterday again. Weird.

Here's the account: [https://www.instagram.com/tkollektief/](https://www.instagram.com/tkollektief/)

So I'm super happy that the account didn't vanish and my followers and posts all remained intact...until today.

My posts suddenly disappeared (I didn't have any particular weird posts) and my followers/people I follow count just started dropping from 716 to exactly 0, at this point. 

It took a lot of work, a long time and a lot of engagement to get to over 60+ posts and 700 followers. I checked Instagram's terms and policies and there wasn't any rule that I could've possibly broken.

Now my question is whether one of you redditor's has experienced the same or something similar?

Is this a bug, did I get hacked or did Instagram deleted them for some reason or another?

Here's the link to my account again [https://www.instagram.com/tkollektief/](https://www.instagram.com/tkollektief/)

TLDR: instagram posts and followers suddenly disappeared without warning. Don't know why.

Any reaction to this would be super helpful! Thanks in advance.",0,1583789006,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fg25hw/instagram_followers_and_posts_suddenly_disappeared/,Instagram,1
fg24gm,sir5yko,"User's ""Live Video"" appears on personal client not business client.","I have a 'professional account' and a personal account. For some reason the professional account can't see live videos?  
\* If I start a windows/chrome tab and log in as my personal account, I see a horizontal list of videos at the top, and will see any live videos  
\* If i start a windows/chrome tab and log in as my professional account, I do not see a horizontal list of videos.  
\* In both cases I see a vertical list of stories on the right.  
\* In the personal account I can visit the person's profile and their avatar will show ""LIVE"", allowing me to click the story and see the live video.  
\* In the professional account the ""LIVE"" doesn't appear even though I'm watching it on my personal profile.

fg1ryi,rollersparks,Initial spike in reach followed by sudden and now lasting plateau. Where I went wrong[?],"With my personal account I go to great lengths to promote various artists/bands/brands I interact with on various levels (not professionally, yet, but this is the aim).

Instagram is new to me but I'm starting to have fun meticulously sifting through related content and playing around with presentation. 
This vision in its early stages and the focus will inevitably sharpen as I find my groove.

I'm wondering if some of you established ""Pros"" of the platform could give me some feedback on 
the layout and if this configuration poses restrictions to my growth, if tags are being used effectively (I personally don't like using more than 2-3 per post), and my approach at connecting/interacting with other accounts of related interests.

Just want to specify that I'm not looking to be a big shot or influencer or anything of the likes.
My aim is to interact/reach with an audience of 4-5K who at some degree relate to my publications. 

Also looking to understand why when I posted my first hashtag I immediately was getting a lot of feedback and quickly the following grew to several hundred in a matter of days. Posts started getting 8-900 likes. 
As soon as things started picking up they just as suddenly took a drastic dive. Same process and vibe but since then I can't seem to get more than a couple interactions and average 30-40 likes pp... like I'm no longer reaching anyone outside of those who currently follow me, much unlike before where the majority of interactions came from nonfollowers.

I'd like to know what might've happened and how to remedy it.

I don't use any outside apps for whatever reason, nor do I post political stuff or porn or anything that is not directly and specifically related to art, books, science, music and motorcycles. Ever. 

Anyway not sure this is the most eloquent way of putting this but I suspect you get the idea!

In light of not promoting ones account on this, I assume if anyone has any suggestions I'll message my account info via message?

fg1cwq,sparkysparks7,Can posting less affect your reach?,"I've been thinking about taking a new approach this year. I've been going through some tough stuff these last few months and haven't kept up with my account. I'm coming to a point where I can invite that focus on posting back into my life. When I've posted lately, I've been getting 2/3 of my average likes. I'm not sure if I'm shadowbanned or if it has something to do with my lack of posting. 

The main reason I'm asking is that I've been debating starting over with a new account, specifically for my niche, and keeping my current account for personal posts, as that is where I have a lot of friends and family following me anyway.

I received 1 or 2 restrictions for being too active. But, ever since February 9th I haven't been able to use the platform properly at all. From that time period till now I only remember being able to like about 4 posts, Instagram would block for the smallest thing, even after liking more than one post. 

I was never even near crazy spammy or used any bots or apps outside of IG. 

I can't like, comment or post captions, but I can post (just without anyone caption, tags etc.) and add stories.

I go on IG every day or every other day to check If I can like again or not. I post every few days as well, but it's becoming so tiring and depressing because it's just blank content and I can't interact with my audience at all. 

Is there anything I can do? Or should I just make a new account (currently at 407 followers), it feels like I'll never get unrestricted.",4,1583769579,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/ffwufh/i_havent_been_able_to_use_ig_properly_for_a_month/,Instagram,1

ffv785,lolsloklos,Instagram has devolved into a shitty spam and ad platform,"Hey fellow instagram users,

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only that thinks instagram has significantly declined in quality, particularly over the last year. I‚Äôm not going to sit here and give a speech about how it was a great community or whatever, my issue isn‚Äôt even with the app itself. It‚Äôs the recent invasion of private advertising, as well as the hypocrisy of the admins (this ties in with the spam). I follow a lot of meme and funny video accounts, as I‚Äôm sure many of us do. Lately, THEY‚ÄôVE been posting ads. What the fuck? On top of that, it‚Äôs those shitty fashion nova ads that frankly, I don‚Äôt give a fuck about. After some research, I found that they have a whole program for that shit called NOVABABE (jesus christ save us all from the cringe). They reportedly  spent 40 millies in 2019 on it. Well fuck me over and ring me up after for round two, because now I‚Äôm getting instagram ads (a recommendation algorithm apparently coded by monkeys) and Fashion Nova ads ALL of the time. 

Now here comes my problem with the incessant porn spam on instagram. Obviously, not everybody that posts illicit content online is a pornstar. But some of the ones showing up as ADS ON MEME ACCOUNTS quite literally are. This one account that gets advertised frequently called fit chick amy runs a patreon account, and I don‚Äôt care what you call the patreon-donor-whatever system, a video of her sucking a plastic cock with her tits out is porn. All of her ads are her shaking her ass and basically showing outlines of her pussy through her clothes. Look, I‚Äôm a straight dude, but I don‚Äôt need to see this bitch waving her cameltoe at me while I‚Äôm scrolling through instagram. 

Obviously, these are just some examples. But just these two alone make it painful to scroll through insta. The crazy part is, a lot of other users agree. Because these ads are technically posts, they have comments, and they all trash both the advertiser and advertisee, ‚ÄúYou still have time to delete thise‚Äù, ‚Äúdoes anybody actually find this attractive‚Äù, etc. 

I‚Äôm sorry about the rant, and I guess I don‚Äôt have a solution. Deleting insta is probably what makes sense, might have to come vibe out here for a while.",2,1583762971,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/ffv785/instagram_has_devolved_into_a_shitty_spam_and_ad/,Instagram,1

ffttz8,PostAwkwardness,I tried to genuinely report an account and my attempt was denied. What do I do?,"Hello ( I have no idea where to post this so don't give hate if its in the wrong place.  
)  
today I was contacted by this person in my dms who harassed me for something I didn't do.   
I should've obviously blocked them but I was planning on reporting the account anyway after the first couple messages because I was already being threatened and harassed right off the bat and I wanted to extend the conversation as much as possible so reporting makes it easier.   
Apparently this individual thought I had made this ""offensive comment"" in all caps on one of their comments or posts and they were dming me to harass me about this particular comment I had made.  
I tried to tell them numerous times that A. Their account is private so if it was on their post I couldn't have possibly said anything since I didn't follow them B. I have absolutely no idea who they were and they're probably messaged the wrong account and C. How does someone commenting on a public post warrant a lengthy harassment  and constant threats in dms?  
They were calling me a bunch of derogatory names, threatened me with violence and being overall extremely disrespectful. I didn't once rudely insult them or threaten them whatsoever and when I asked them to show me a screenshot of where I had apparently sent this message but they said that they didn't know where it was and that they delete their notifications after they read them so they didn't have any proof that I did this in the first place.   
Fast forward through the conversation they had ""found"" the comment and turns out (surprise) I was in fact the wrong person and that it was someone else they were trying to contact.   
So obviously I reported this account for violating the community guidelines and apparently Instagram reviewed the account and and they find anything that went against the guidelines...   
Really Instagram?! How does this not go against community guidelines.   
They ended up blocking me but I still have all the dms to prove this entire situation

ffrcec,D-RayTheGreat38,Question about follow suggestions: (just created my account),"So I created an account with Instagram a few hours ago, and only plan on using it for following youtubers/celebrities and such; aka nothing personal.

I noticed that when it had registered me and logged me in for the first time, I was getting suggestions to follow family members....I was like ""wtf""? So first thing I did was look up if you can remove personal suggestions and/or make it so _**I**_ won't show up as a suggestion on their end. The only thing I found was [this](https://help.instagram.com/530450580417848). So, I followed the steps and **un**checkmarked where it says _""Include your account when recommending similar accounts people might want to follow""_ (meaning I disabled it).

Now my main question is, will those family members/family friends get suggestions for my account? _(I don't want anyone knowing I created one)_",0,1583740889,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/ffrcec/question_about_follow_suggestions_just_created_my/,Instagram,1

She's got an insta page for her art. which ill leave anon for privacy sake, but has been trying to message and comment to build a bigger following but a few times she's been logged out and gotten temporarily blocked for some reason, we suspect the system thinks she's a bot or something.

well this last time she got logged out she has been unable to get back in (it kept saying error and some other things) and unfortunately the period of time she was unable to log in was long enough she has forgotten the password. So she is theoretically able to login, but cannot as the passwords old and new are not working. So to try and recover it we've been trying to get into the old af email address she never uses except for account making and she can't remember that login info either. We've had to send in a form to recover the email address to try and recover the instagram page, but if this doesn't work we don't have many other options that we're aware of.

fflct5,hoodedsushi,Stalling on 6k followers since Dec,"Hi all üëã
I've been growing my account for roughly 2 years at a steady rate but it seemed to hit a brick wall in Dec. My niche is snack food. My followers are at 6k and it was steadily climbing but now it will never go any higher. While I see other accounts keep climbing that are way newer than mine.

Before Dec (2019) I was seeing loads of likes and peoples comments on my posts. Some posts managed to get 10k worth of likes (which was bonkers to me haha). Now I'll be lucky if my post reaches 100 likes which doesn't make sense considering my follower count.

I ended up removing accounts that looked like bot accounts as I feel they damage your account. I'm just wondering if IG flagged me for the behaviour? The max I'd remove was like 20 or 30 a day. 

I was told to remove the hashtags on posts and use less than 30. Some people recommend using no hashtags at all. So, I mixed it up between the two BUT it made absolutely no difference.

Yesterday I posted a photo and it only managed to get 50ish likes after 12 hours of being posted. Which is kinda frustrating.

Could my account possibly been reported (for god knows what) and it's hurt it? I'm at such a loss and feeling a little discouraged at this point. Any tips/help would be appreciated :)",4,1583710480,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fflct5/stalling_on_6k_followers_since_dec/,Instagram,1

ffhr8k,NoAimMassacre,"Guys on insta, what do you upload?","Hi
After years I decided to finally use insta(I hate the influencers and 'show off/selfie' culture.

So Ive been wondering about what I could put on it? Im a guy so I dont take selfies all day and I don't really like taking pictures of myself.
Do you guys put pictures of your hobbies or something?

I like shoes, watches, suits, among other things but Im feeling like I would be showing off by taking pictures of this stuff.

Im probably overthinking it but the instagram culture makes me feel like I should kinda be careful.

Such  a shame that she had just uploaded quite a few personal images to her  instagram account (as the icould update had stalled) as it was her  birthday and had upgraded her phone.

Now it looks like the account has been disabled or deleted. Just wanted to post this to see if anybody knows any way to help.

If  there is nothing that can be done, then hopefully just a warning to  others, perhaps enable 2 step authentication, but dont expect any help  from Instagram as I am sure they are useless.

ff8zr4,tomlondon22,"How to remove Fake, Inactive, Ghost or bot Followers from Instagram 2020","Hey guys!

I've seen many people asking the same question over and over again about how to remove those inactive or fake followers from their accounts. I decided to make a post to so people could search on Reddit and find a solution easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why should I remove my own followers?**  
Instagram's new algorithms **extremely** value engagement.  
Having followers who do not interact with your posts (liking, commenting or saving) can significantly¬†affect your posts'¬†visibility. By removing these accounts it will be much more easier for you to get to the explore page and reach more people.  
It will help boost your posts' engagement rate, giving you a higher chance to increase your impressions by hitting the¬†explore page and potentially more customers etc.  
 

**How can I remove them?**

There are a few ways you can try to remove fake, inactive bot or ghost followers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Manually removal**

You can remove fake &amp; ghosts followers by yourself. All you need to is to click on the ""Followers"" tab in your profile. Check every single follower if it real or not. Click on remove or either block &amp; unblock them. Don't do it too quick and don't remove too many followers in one session. Since Instagram's new updates in June, a lot of people get blocked from doing any actions if your cross the Instagram's limits.

**Note: This method is not good to remove ghost followers.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Apps**

There are many apps that can help you to remove fake &amp; ghosts followers over Instagram. From my experience they're inaccurate. They can remove real followers as well. I won't really recommend for you to use it but it's an option. The app that I used was ""Cleaner for IG""

**Note: This method is automated so it can remove real followers by mistake.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Social Media Agency**

There is an social media agency that I used to remove fake and ghost followers on Instagram. They remove the followers manually one by one from your account according to Instagram limits. They can target fake and ghost followers and will remove them gradually. It worked well for me. The website is [www.fakefollowersremoval.com](https://www.fakefollowersremoval.com).

\- I tried logging into the old account but I took a long time for me to remember the password so when I finally got in, it asked me for a security code to verify my identity

\- It sent the security code to an email I don't remember having.

\- I can't access my email so I don't have the security code.

For my dissertation I am researching the effects of celebrity endorsement on Instagram on young people's mental health, to do this I have made a survey. So, if you're over 18 and use Instagram, and you would like to take part please click the link below. It should take roughly 10 minutes and all responses will remain confidential. 

Thanks very much in advance!

fecvnb,knorxo,Is it better to post single pictures or carousel?,So whenever I have a photoshoot I want to put all pictures of that shoot I want to share into one carousel post as I want to have a clean profile and show the things in kind of a logical order. But I sometimes think maybe I'd gain more attention if I just spread the photoshoots and post every single picture independently in mixed order. I know a carousel might attract more attention and thus engagement in one post as people take more time looking at it but I often question whether they actually go through all pictures in there and maybe spreading it out into multiple posts would yield the bigger benefit as it would present all the pictures equally. The thing is  I like to describe the intention and what went into the photoshoot in the carousel post. If I spread that up I wouldn't know where to put that and where my followers would look for that. I also considered having the carousel post and later randomly posting single pictures that were already included there as throwbacks with the full description still in the carousel post. I know reposting stuff is considered bad practice but many of these pictures would otherwise be buried in the carousel.,18,1583498260,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fecvnb/is_it_better_to_post_single_pictures_or_carousel/,Instagram,1

My Asus zenfone 4 on android 8.0 doesn't even have that option (not even in developer options), nor any kind of setting related to battery saving modes...

fdwa04,invulnerable888,Yes! iPhones also use screen capturing to post videos in Instagram! Not only Android phones! The quality? Here's what I've found!,"Many things have been said... Instagram isn't optimized well for Android so photos, videos and live streaming are bad while using android... Apple pays big money to Instagram to make it better in iOS for ever... Besides many many ones... So I've decided to try to figure out the truth!
I got iPhone 11 iphone xs max  galaxy s9+ and galaxy S10+
After my tests yes IPhones perform significantly better in low light videos/live streaming because in android videos have slow shutter speed + lower iso so they look like GIF! But it's not because Instagram in iOS use the camera resources better! Many people have claimed that Instagram is only capturing the screen in android! that's not true! Both of iOS and Android capture the screen in the ""photo mode"" to post photos/videos and they don't use the stock camera app video capturing.. so why is android worse in low light? Because in ""photo mode"" the shutter speed is slower than iPhone. THIS IS THE REASON! it's not about optimization! Speaking about optimization You can try to record selfie video using iPhone xs max in WhatsApp and compare it with the Stock camera and you will be surprised about the differences in The audio quality! so where's the optimization here dear iOS? I am not android fanboy I want to get the best! so Instagram and even Snapchat must provide some simple tools for like controling iso and shutter speed even for live streaming and everything will be better in iOS and Android!",0,1583419721,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fdwa04/yes_iphones_also_use_screen_capturing_to_post/,Instagram,1

fdvqvf,Tarlzie_,Someone keeps login into my Instagram accounts and I don‚Äôt know how,"So I have 2 Instagram accounts. A public main account, and a private one where I post random nonsense. Two weeks ago someone got access to my private account and completely changed my linked email etc so I had no access at all and they then tried to attack my main account and they got in but unfortunately they couldn‚Äôt change my password for a few reasons so I was able to boot them out and fully recover both accounts. Well just earlier I got a billion confirmation codes to reset my password on my private which wasn‚Äôt me, unfortunately I was ten minutes later and they gained access to my account and were able to change my passwords but I honestly have no clue how? I have a two factor authentication method which are my phone and an email (that is different to the email of the main account) but there were no emails about a password change so I‚Äôm so lost on how they are doing it! I also managed to identify their phone Serial Number and their rough location but if anyone just has any general advice that would be great! My passwords are also very secure and I never ever have logged into anything other than my Instagram app with my private account especially since the first incident",3,1583417328,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fdvqvf/someone_keeps_login_into_my_instagram_accounts/,Instagram,1

Also, I can't upload video stories longer than 15 seconds.¬† Let me explain: the app actually divides the video, loads the first 15-second clip and the others give a ""loading error"" message.¬† This is a minor problem, which I solve from time to time by dividing the longer videos with an external¬†app, although it is still annoying to have to carry out the whole operation every time.",0,1583371486,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fdnhdk/annoying_problems_with_the_app_xiaomi_9t_pro_user/,Instagram,1

fdik40,ellvoid,Instagram Following Issue,"About 4 months ago, I started noticing people were being followed on an Instagram page I manage.
It‚Äôs easy to notice because we‚Äôre only supposed to be following 1 person, but once or twice every two weeks or so a random person would be followed.
Their accounts were even private sometimes so they had to accept a follow request from us.

Bear in mind we‚Äôve taken measures against this:

- Changed the password multiple times and kept it private amongst us, making sure it‚Äôs secure

- Logged out of all devices except for mine

- Turned on two-factor authentication to get notified when suspicious log-in attempts occur

- Checked to see if any third-party applications have access to the account and none do

Does anyone know why this might be happening?

A month ago I started noticing it happened on another account I manage, but much less frequently than on the other.

Keep in mind I manage around 10 Instagram accounts that I log in and out of a lot since Instagram only allows for up to 5 accounts at a time, and I don‚Äôt have this problem on any of them except for these 2.",1,1583351309,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fdik40/instagram_following_issue/,Instagram,1

fdcihx,jj91edx,new Windows 10 Instagram app,"Instagram has updated its Windows 10 app to a technology called PWA, or ""progressive web app,"" which is apparently a mixture of an app and a regular web page (as I understand it)

So far, it's been no good

The big advantage, they say, is it has direct messaging for the first time, but I've used the Windows 10 app for direct messaging for years, and I see many other users are saying the same thing

They say you can't send and receive photos on DM, but I've had no trouble with that, either

Also, if someone has posted multiple photos, it does let you see all of them, which it never used to

Some of the bad things:

‚Ä¢ You still can't post photos to your page, which makes no sense at all. Let people do things the way they want, and the functions on the apps and the web page should be the same, if for no other reason than consistency. If people want to edit their photos before they post them, they're going to find a way whether you push them to the phone app or not 

‚Ä¢ You don't get notified if someone sends you a message

‚Ä¢ There's no place in settings (as there used to be) to turn these notifications on

‚Ä¢ It doesn't tell you whether someone is online with a little green dot as it used to. It also doesn't report status such as ""active 2 hours ago"" anymore 

‚Ä¢ If you click on someone's comments, it only allows you to leave a comment, it doesn't show you any of their other comments

‚Ä¢ There's still no way to refresh pages, so if someone likes or follows you, or posts something new, you don't find out until you've shut down the app and started it again

Hopefully they will fix these things soon, but I doubt it",3,1583326096,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fdcihx/new_windows_10_instagram_app/,Instagram,1

I did not know where to post so I am posting here, someone PLEASE re-assure me because I am freaking out. My instagram is pretty low-key, I do not have any family added expect for my brother. Recently I opened my Instagram on my MacBook, something I have not done previously for a long time. I stumbled across the activity log and to my surprise my account had been logged into multiple places, most of them around 6-7 hours away from my location. Mind you, I have no friends nor family in that area. NO ONE. I did not think too much about it and changed my password, again account being super lame I did not think anyone intended on hacking me. I have a different g-mail account for my social media accounts, simply because they send too many mails and I like to keep my mail solely for work or school related work. Today I opened my instagram on my MacBook again only to re-assure myself it was a one time thing, it was not. Someone has yet again logged in on my Instagram around 7 hours away. I live in a particularly small country so 7 hours for us is like 7 states away for you all. I decided to open my email to see what is happening and the password has been changed 4 MONTHS AGO, no way to access it since I never really bothered with the security system. I changed the email and the password for my account for now. I am very freaked out since I feel my privacy has been invaded so badly, anyone has any advice on how to secure my account better? Re-assurance is very welcome!

fcwf6o,Correct_Cartoonist,Continually Action Blocked,"Hi everyone, I'm a bit concerned about my IG account. Its fairly new, created in January.  Its a meme page I had set as business account.  I may have been overly ambitious about growing the page too big too fast, by following 40 people per hr and on separate days unfollowing 40 per hr who haven't followed back.  As of last Tuesday I started receiving the action block message on everything I tried to do.  Thought it would go away by the next day but didn't.  I went cold turkey for 2-3 days, and when I returned, still received the action block.  Checked it on Sunday and am still action blocked. So am thinking of not doing anything on it for 2 weeks hoping that fixes it.  

I  also found this app called follow and unfollow, which gives you a list of the people who your following, and who aren't following you back. Which I installed and signed up for  a little over a month ago  thinking it would be a good idea,  then immediately after read an article saying that Instagram's not in favor of most third party apps, and may consider your account compromised if you use them. However this app does not include the use of bots, nor does it automatically follow or unfollow, its all manual.  But am concerned they might still view my account as compromised. So my questions are...

* Is this app against the rules?
* Does the action block message hurt your account more and more the more times it appears, and does it reset the timer on the ban each time it appears? 
*  Is there anyway to reverse the damage I may have done to this account? I want them to understand I am not a bot or a spammer.
* How will I know when the block is removed?
* Can this action blocks be permanent?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Most of us are lost in the dark, with IG concealing its constantly changing policies behind vague terminology.

fcv9tp,axentric,How to enjoy social media again? For entrepreneurs.,"I am an artist and I used to love social media and posting. Now I get really stressed out and usually avoid/procrastinate posting. 

I have had some serious things happen in my life (mom getting cancer twice, her having a major stroke and now she is getting crippled. Not to mention my own health issues and had major spinal surgery on my neck 2 yrs ago. And my Dad just passed in December. I have also been a caretaker for my mom for the most part. It seems like every time I try and get into a flow and start getting into some routine some serious life crisis happens like what I mentioned above. Then I stop making art and then my social media takes a hit (drop in engagement, loss of followers, etc) and then I feel defeated. It‚Äôs a horrible cycle. 

So how do I break it and get in the habit and also make social media fun again???",1,1583245451,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/fcv9tp/how_to_enjoy_social_media_again_for_entrepreneurs/,Instagram,1

I used to comment on 90 posts as Gary Vee suggested in one of his IG related video, but this might actually be counterproductive as Instagram could identify you as a bot. 
I also use the same set of hashtags where I change 5/6 of them to be related to the post.

2. If I log into my account via website, my feed won't load as well. If it does load, it will only show old posts. But I can watch the stories without any crash.  


3. Couldn't be area coverage(?) problem because my brother and sister's Instagram works perfectly fine.  


4. I did ask a friend to try and log into my account from their phone. And my account works fine there?

\-Instagram does not register at all the photos in the library, only some at random, making it really hard to upload more than one.   
If you want to do that, you have to upload them all to google photos and then select them from there.  


\-Instagram crops photos no matter what, because the ycare about format, not size.  
You can downscale an image as much as you want and is still gonna be cropped, which is ridiculous of course.

fc7vme,SoilHealing,On Instagram - how to retarget based on video views,"   

Hi All,   


I am wishing to take my educational series on IG and share it as widely and as successfully as possible.

 However, there's a bit of a roadblock:  
 ... I've created an education video series (The Basics of Healthy Soil Formation - fb page is 'Soil Healing'. It was intended to be almost solely as an Instagram Stories 'Story Highlights' only I've discovered the content is too dense to chop up into 15sec pieces, so now it's 5 short vids (1 min or less) that I've posted natively on IG.

It's in 1920x1080 format (wrong format, I know, for IG posts)

Because it's in this format I have to post it natively using IG where I can use the resize arrows. If I use FB 'Creator Studio' and post it using the 'Instagram' tab the videos come out tiny and can't be resized. Aaaggh - anyway...

Now I want to promote Vid 1 (of 5) on IG and retarget based on video views to eventually chain all 5 together, so if you watch 10 secs of Vid 1 you get served Vid 2 and so on.

There's no commercial motive, I just want to reach max audience for this content.

Now - as far as I see the only way to target based on video views is via FB - 'Create Custom Audience' - Ideally I would select the videos I see under 'Instagram Video Profile' - however, it appears that video posted natively via IG doesn't show up as associated with the 'Instagram Video Profile' of my IG page ('soilhealing').

So when I go to the page in Create Custom Audience where I see 'videos associated with Instagram Video Profile' of 'Soilhealing' on IG, there are no videos, even though 5 have been posted on IG.

So - for videos posted natively in IG, is there a way to retarget based on video views?

I'm concerned that if I post to IG from FB (like FB would do if I boost the post) that the video will come out tiny and no-one will be able to read it (it's a video of png stills).

Hope what I've written is clear enough, I really want people to understand how we have to care for soil!

Much appreciation for anyone who reads this far!

I read on another post that Instagram is killing off engagement to get people to pay more for ads. And honestly, at this point, you HAVE to follow trends just to get any engagement/ make it big. 

Which is really sad because I don't want to feel pressured to do something that I don't like to get engagement.

fbvztu,BobsOrCookies,AI NSFW Recognition System,"Twitter recently released a new AI system that can recognize NSFW posts that violate Twitter TOS. This may be a viable solution towards censoring the frequent NSFW posts that appear on Instagram. It is certainly a hard task, considering all the kinks the AI engineers have to work to smooth out. For example, half-naked babies are not considered NSFW. For AI to slowly begin to identify NSFW images, we need to give them a list of photos for it to begin to recognize. Eventually, though, there will be less of a need for more photos, as the AI begins to learn the pattern.This is an important step in creating a safe Instagram environment.

So this is the thing, i was late to instagram and when i tried to create an account with my main email it came back as it already being used. Strange i thought this is the first time ive ever tried creating an IG account.. 

So i just used another one of my emails.

And after some research and search history on the email that is being used by someone else there is some notifications about a login to instagram from unkown source etc. someone in Malaysia apparently.

Im guessing they use their facebook to login that way and just put my email probably by mistake, maybe they put a letter to much in or something i don't know.  
I really don't think they have access to my email since ive checked many times where the logins to the actual email come from and all are from my IP.

So what do you guys recommend i do here, should i do a password reset and just change the email and let that be it or should i de-activate this persons account ?

Unless people only care for your main content, they may not know it's your post if it's something a little different then normal. You get less engagement on that post. Always happens.

It‚Äôs quite literally just my main group of friends, most of them female. A few weeks ago at 2am I posted a collection of pictures where my ass looked nice. I was fully clothed in some, obviously wearing panties/bikini bottoms in others, and there was one from the side where I have lifted up my shirt to see the arch of my back to my butt, but there is no ‚Äúpantyline‚Äù around my hip. This photo is cropped by the bottom of my butt so there‚Äôs not even a chance of seeing anything else (my pose blocks it too). I archived it around 5am out of respect to my boyfriend and the post stayed in my archive for the next few weeks. I logged on today to a message that they had removed a post for nudity. I assumed I knew which one (a bathroom I was in that had erotic art as it‚Äôs decor) but nope, still up. Also all my photos of me in bras or me with my nipples covered were still up. Instead pretty much all posts from before 4 months a go had vanished, NONE of which had anything more scandalous than me in a bra/swimsuit. The collection in my archive was deleted as well. I discovered if I archived a post they allowed, I would get an old one back. They‚Äôre not deleted, it‚Äôs like their ‚Äúhidden‚Äù under the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù of my account. Like my account is a chest with a secret bottom or something. Has anyone had this? It‚Äôs not like the pictures of my ass were my cheeks pressed up against the camera (I‚Äôve seen ‚ÄòInstagram girls‚Äô with far more sexualized photos than mine were, hell Ive seen meme pages that straight up post pornography), and it‚Äôs was bloody archived on a private account for Pete‚Äôs sake.

Whats weird though, is that it only seems to happen on story posts that relate to the audience their targeting. (I.e. if i post a picture of an apple on my story, i get watched by an applefarmer). 

Am i being targeted by bots? Or am I being targeted by a social media manager? A lot of the people that I‚Äôm talking about don‚Äôt follow me, don‚Äôt like my posts, they just watch my story.

I have completely revamped my Instagram page with both design and content. I have even started investing into their sponsored ads as advised however my engagement is not what it used to be with worse looking posts, scattered content and no ads. 

Is this Instagram doing or do you think it is the users of instagram? I see so many pages with heaps of followers getting shocked engagement rates. The users simply are not interacting with the posts. What's the point of this all? People will soon realize it's a waste of time investing money and effort into posts and aren't getting returns on it. The social element of Instagram will fall eventually so it makes no sense if this is intentional by Instagram or intentional by users not engaging with the people they choose to follow. It seems like there's no way forward.

fayhtp,Kyneath,Can I get banned for putting too many tags in the photo?,"Hey guys,

I tried to upload a photo today but I've got an annoying issue. I put 19 tags in the photo and the photo is not showing on the profiles which I tagged. Even If I use just 1 tag (I tagged myself) it doesn't show anything on my profile either. Yesterday I uploaded a picture with 20 tags and all was great....Hashtags work perfectly. I also tried different photo but the result was the same...

Is it possible that I've got tag ban cuz of tagging lots of accounts?

fawoam,chumdrumbeebop,Insta erasing my comments. Can‚Äôt even use the app anymore.,"Usually when I‚Äôm typing a comment or a comment reply on a post, if I try to look at my entire comment before I submit it or scroll through the text whatsoever, it will send me back to the original post and erase all traces of my text. This has been the case for a very long time so I try to select and copy what I‚Äôve typed every line or so to make sure that I don‚Äôt lose it, but if I forget to do that, my comment is erased almost every time. There have been many times when I‚Äôve spent a significant amount of time on a comment and then it‚Äôs just gone. I know that I‚Äôm not accidentally swiping to the side, as it happens even when I ‚Äútest‚Äù the app by beginning a comment, typing a bunch of nonsense text, then try to deliberately, slowly, and delicately scroll to the top of the text. There is no other app on my phone that registers my vertical swipes as horizontal swipes. This is ONLY a problem I have with Instagram and always has been. I‚Äôm making this post because I just had another instance of this and I‚Äôve decided that I will not use that function anymore. I cannot comment on Instagram anymore. It never works and it‚Äôs always frustrating. Why even allow that to happen? Why set things up like that? Since I won‚Äôt be making comments anymore and I hardly ever make my own posts, I‚Äôll probably delete the app soon. Direct messaging is the only thing I use, and I hardly use that either.

fas6k7,owenjae,Anybody remember michelle_cook81?,"  this had to have been sometime in 2015. I‚Äôm inclined to say spring of 2015. I was relatively new to instagram and following some popular pages. If i recall correctly, a certain popular page posted a screenshot of a women‚Äôs account, her username was @michelle_cook81 or something similar to that. The significance of this screenshot was to show that she had over 30k posts, and she was posting pictures literally every few seconds. Her bio was something along the lines that she was an English major. The posts were odd, mostly selfies of this woman, in some of them she was making facial expressions, giving the middle finger, and in other photos, it almost looked like someone else had taken her picture for her. Lots of people started flocking to her profile, commenting, joking, etc. she had new posts every single second so there was no shortage of content. I never ended up following her, and she made her account private within that day, and i would guess she began to block the mass of followers she attracted. It was a very odd situation, and Michelle definitely seemed like she was not 100% mentally healthy. I cannot find the account anywhere. there are parody accounts but nothing on the original account.

Yesterday, someone messaged me and liked a couple of my pictures and we just chatted. At some point this person started talking about how they know how to hack and stuff like that. A little weird but I just brushed it off. Then they started pestering me for naked pictures. 

I immediately blocked their account, made my account private in case they kept my username for an alt, changed my password, and turned on Two-Factor Auth.  I also don't use my real name or any personal info but I do have my face on the account and I use my alias on a handful of other sites.  I was back and forth on reporting the account too, but I noticed when I click on report it doesn't let me do that anyway for some reason. The box pops up and immediately goes away before I can do anything.

Despite everything I'm still feeling kind of paranoid about the whole thing. I feel like this is just some person trying to take advantage of someone with fear but another part of me is worried there might be some validity to what this person was saying.

I‚Äôm personally friends with and follow some IG baddies and it just baffles me how fast they grow with little effort.

What am I doing wrong? Really considering to say fuck it and just start posting thirst traps alongside my arts.

faal49,agitokki,troubles with inputting emoji's?,"some context: i have an android (s9+)

i've recently been noticing that my emoji's keep appearing differently than what they're supposed to be when on instagram. it doesn't matter if i'm using the emoji's or if they're just appearing on my timeline by others using them, they look like the facebook emoji's instead of my regular android ones? this never, ever happened to me up until recently, mind you. i don't use emoji's too often on my stories so i've only just discovered a pattern in combination with seeing them on my timeline.

i've uninstalled and reinstalled the app to see if it were just a minor glitch. this seems to work, as opening the app again when i've reinstalled it fixes the issue and my emoji's appear as my devices. i've also noticed that a few people (who have android phones themselves) have no issues with this, as on their stories they appear as regular android emoji's as well. however, after a while, when i go to use an emoji, they go back into being facebook ones?? like?? it was fine literally just a few hours ago and now it's switched back into appearing as a facebook emoji?

i get that facebook bought out instagram or whatever‚Äîit quite clearly says ""instagram from facebook"" when i open the app, so i'm wondering if this just has something to do with this? but why would it, when i'm literally the only person this is happening to? i asked a friend of mine who uses apple and she says it's never happened to her, i've tried googling it and getting in touch with instagram, but i think we all know how their customer service is like... i'm just a little more confused than anything. why is this happening? is it an option i have turned on? or is it some kind of version number that i have that just... converts all your devices emoji's into facebook ones because facebook is the parent company?

i'm just asking why it's doing this and how i can fix it. i took a screenshot of an [example](https://imgur.com/1OQwu01) so you could see the difference i'm talking about. one on the left is my device's emoji's (android) and the one on the right is what happens when i've opened the app again a few times or so. 

if you guys can let me know if this is just a permanent new thing they've come out with or if it's an actual bug, i'd be very thankful. instagram isn't the best at customer support, so i went to the next best thing. sorry if this is a really stupid question‚Äîit's about emoji's ffs, but i'd just like to know.

f9zo62,SettingIntentions,Instagram is Making Me Follow Random Accounts,"This has been going on for months, and I thought I was crazy. Today I finally proved without a doubt that something fishy is up. 

I woke up this morning, and posted on my story a funny meme about Corona Virus that was sent to me. Went about my day like normal. 

In the evening I signed into Instagram, and suddenly I was following an Instagram account... It was titled ""Corona Virus Memes"" or something like that. 

**I was following the account, but I know 1,000% that it was not me that followed the account.** 

Now on the computer I've checked the ""Apps &amp; Websites"" settings that tells me what 3rd party things have access to my account. 

Only Tinder does. 

I also checked ""Login Activity,"" and sure enough all logins are mine, 100% verified. 

**What in the world is going on?** 

My best guess is that Instagram's algorithm makes you follow accounts related to topics that you're posting about in a sneaky effort to get you to spend more time on the platform by giving you more content. 

I'd prefer a better explanation. What in the world is going on, and more importantly **how can I stop my account from constantly following random profiles?**

f9uk1w,DrouinWasOnsides,Are hashtags are essentially useless on this platform in 2020?,"Hello gram fam.

It just seems to me that all hashtags do are bring bots to your page. I can see how if all you want are useless, non engaging followers how that would be a somewhat effective strategy. However, I have never once as a consumer typed in something like # singerstyleFL and searched that feed. Likewise, I've never gotten valuable fans out of posting hashtags. They are 100 percent of the time bots or spammers or other entrepreneurs obviously ""providing value"" on my posts but are really just trying to gain followers themselves. 

Every entrepreneur and instagram guru says hashtags are where its at. I believe a lot of us have blindly accepted this to be true. The perfect amount of hashtags, the right mix of high volume / low volume tags ... it all seems like a misguided semblance of control for users on the platform. Am I way off here? I'd love to be proved wrong!! :)

f9ox6y,thepettiestofpetty,InsaFEUD Landon Romano vs Chris Crocker,"This beef is escalating!!! It all started a couple years ago when Landon Romano hit the o Instagram scene making wild videos that many agree copy Chris Crockers style. In fairness Landon has been accused of straight out copying many people, not just Chris.

Chris had posted a vlog about how Landon messaged him and told him that he was an inspiration, etc. However, shortly after that exchange Landon unfollowed Chris which lead Chris to believe his compliments were not genuine.

Fast forward to two days ago Chris Crocker puts out a rap track called The Conjouring which many are stating takes a direct dig at Landon. Landon responded the next day with a cryptic Instagram post throwing two middle fingers. Rumor has it that Landon is FURIOUS that Chris put out a rap track as it's been wildly reported that Landon, who has rapped on Instagram, has been working on music (presumably rap) with Will [I.Am](https://i.am/). it is very odd that Chris rushed out a track, which is his FIRST rap track ever, just as Landon is slated to release new music. Did Chris just rush to do this so he can once again claim Landon copied him?

Chris isnt the only one going after Landon Romano. Lohanthony also recently posted a tweet about Romano, but Romano responded directly to it shutting down Lohanthony's assertion Landon copies him.

What's clear is Landon is much more popular than both Crocker and Lohanthony. His style is very much inspired by Chris Crocker, but he also incorporated what many are calling ""black girl mannerisms"" and black culture appropriation.

What do you think? Is Landon a busted fake or the next Cardi B on the brink of viral success in the rap game?",1,1582697828,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f9ox6y/insafeud_landon_romano_vs_chris_crocker/,Instagram,1

f9kmtj,elbergotas96,Is my ex still stalking my IG?,"Just for the record! Im not bothered at all by her stalking so please don‚Äôt tell me to block her and end with this. I appreciate any and all advice and I understand your good intentions, but I find this quite funny considering how things ended between me and her, I‚Äôm living in a new country and talking to some very beautiful women, so her stalking me is definitely not a reason to lose sleep haha

So here goes:

We broke up in 2017, we‚Äôve been on and off for a while and officially broke off contact in January of 2019. Weeks after that I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that every other day her account would switch from being private to ‚Äúuser not found‚Äù (I‚Äôm able to still find her thanks to comments shes made on my account that weren‚Äôt deleted). So essentially she blocks me then unblocks me every 3 days or so. 

I noticed this going on weeks after we stopped communicating since I still missed her but as I was starting to get over her, I started to find it pretty amusing and eventually just hilarious. Today I am very happy and living my best life and just see it as something to poke fun at now. 

When this was at its peak, my best friend and I would make small bets as to whether or not I was blocked on a certain day and the loser either bought food, beer, or weed, or all 3 if the occasion called for it (yes, it went on so frequently that we were able to make bets and have an almost even amount of wins and losses).

It eventually stopped and now it was just her account being kept on private, but just recently I got curious noticed that I was blocked again lmao

Im curious as to what you guys think might be going through her mind because firstly my IG is on private and secondly there‚Äôs no reason for her to block me if I already can‚Äôt see her IG since she‚Äôs also on private üòÇ

If you‚Äôre a professional IG stalker and know your way around IG a little too well, I won‚Äôt judge you... is there a reason she does this and is there a way for her to bypass my private IG account (other than using a mutual friend‚Äôs IG)?

Hope to hear from y‚Äôall soon!",2,1582678138,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f9kmtj/is_my_ex_still_stalking_my_ig/,Instagram,1

f936tp,gotstalked42069,"Someone is posting my pictures pretending they're traveling/dating my girlfriend, help","A bit of backstory: got a call from my gf to ask her to pick her up from work right away. She was supposed to grab drink with an ex-coworker after work but she called me out of no where and I went to pick her up straight from work. Flustered, she told me she found out the same ex-coworker who she was supposed to meet was stealing my photos of her on my instagram and pretending he was traveling/hiking/backpacking with my girlfriend (the stalker, is what we'll call him, blocked my gf so she can't ever find out). She only found out when another past coworker reached out to her by chance right before meeting up with the stalker. I can't see the photos he's posting because his profile is private. We only found out when my gf's other coworker who happened to follow him and me noticed the same pictures. 

I figure this might be another case of reporting to instagram and providing proof that someone is pretending to be me (I assume through the link below) but this has never happened to me and I honestly never thought it would happen to me. So I guess I'm asking if anyone has any advice or past experience with this. I have set my instagram page to private and is looking to change my handle. Even though I don't make money from instagram, I do take a lot of traveling pictures and I like to share them. I understand having a public profile risk this type of stuff but it feels like he's more stalking my gf than me which worries the both of us. Also thank god she didn't go grab drinks with him.

f8y4tt,rapheatalert,How can I tell what content is copyrighted on Instagram?,"Recently I've started a page that revolves around posting music content such as news, freestyles and lyrics. I have made posts that very obviously include copyrighted content such as music videos from popular signed artists and these posts remain. On the other hand I can make a piece of content that includes a freestyle from an artist on a radio show and that will get copyrighted. What I want to know is how can I tell if the piece of content I want to post includes copyright before creating and posting it. Is there any rules with copyrighted content like on YouTube? I believe on YouTube you are allowed to post up to 30 seconds of copyrighted content without getting striked or something along those lines.",2,1582578268,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f8y4tt/how_can_i_tell_what_content_is_copyrighted_on/,Instagram,1

f8wy9i,bananalimoa,My reach is a joke,"I'm verified account, 45k followers, artist. I used to get at around 15-25k reach even when I had lower following, but the last month is a disaster(7-12 k MAX). When my hashtags don't work (0-15 impressions), my reach from home page is fantastic, but when my hashtags are working (1-5k which is still very low number for my followers) my home reach is low. I thought I was shadowbanned, but hashtags work for two days and then they stop working for two days. I'm not doing anything different, I used to get at least 1.5k likes on a bad post, but now I'm happy to reach 1k. My stories has also dropped drastically, used to get 3.2k views, now it stops at 1.5k.  


I have a theory and it might sound weird but, all the artists I know that has started with ig around the same time I did (2017) have now very low engagement based on how many followers they have (I know that people who used to follow us back in 2017 might not have interest in us anymore, but we're still gaining followers every day). And I know a lot of new artists who just joined ig (2019) and have amazing engagement and they got so much bigger following in 6 months than I did in 3 years.

First time poster but long time reader!

Thanks for the advice shared on this sub. I‚Äôve found it really helpful.

I‚Äôve been on Instagram since 2014.  For the last 8 months, I‚Äôve been taking Instagram more seriously with the goal of building up my followers.  I‚Äôve found a niche somewhat, my content is good, and I‚Äôve been trying to surf the algorithm as best I can. 

I hit a good stride.. gaining followers, 25% engagement, reposted by other accounts.. all great.

I hit a block this weekend - literally. Action blocked for liking too many pictures. I had been going through the hashtags and liking a few pictures from users.  I must have exceeded the mysterious limit. I had been spending an hour a day since January doing this but for whatever reason, this Saturday it must have been too much.

I recruited @technician_ig on twitter to help me get it removed so hopefully it will be gone soon.

I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to move forward from here.  I want to keep growing but hashtags alone won‚Äôt cut it. I definitely don‚Äôt want any more action blocks, especially now that my account has been ‚Äòflagged‚Äô.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Also, I use two third party apps - Followers and WhenToPost.  Should I stop using these?

PS. I‚Äôve never used bots or automation, I don‚Äôt follow/unfollow, I don‚Äôt comment. It was just liking other pics.

All my posts on IG are very high engagement, often making it on the explore page etc. 

I've done promotions in the past that were no exceptions - reach is well above IG's predicted range  before running the promotion.

But the last 2 promotions I've run won't even spend my budget - after 24 hours I'm still at 0 dollars spent, so obviously 0 reach, 0 everything.

This seems to be a bug, has anyone had a similar experience?",0,1582533660,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f8oeyx/promotion_bug/,Instagram,1

f8m0iw,DreamCentipede,Not gaining followers despite trying my hardest.,"The past month I've started taken my art account seriously and I've been posting every day. I consider my art to be pretty good. It's not professional-grade or anything, but it doesn't look unpleasing. I use hashtags correctly, or at least I think I do (a mixture of popular and less popular tags that are related to my post). I engage with every person who comments on my posts, and I also engage with other accounts and their comment sections. I post nothing but art on my account, no random selfies or anything (I have a separate personal account for that). 

I just want to know why I can't gain any followers. I know its still early on, but I feel like I should at least be gaining a couple of followers every few posts? I get 20-60 likes per post. I feel like I'm doing everything right. The only thing I can think of is that I post different kinds of art and I don't have a specific niche, but I am trying to focus on sci-fi/fantasy work. Even still, I think I should be getting more followers than I am. My current goal is 100.

Anyways, I'd love for any advice or recommendations. Thanks.",4,1582519525,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f8m0iw/not_gaining_followers_despite_trying_my_hardest/,Instagram,1

I really, really want to either make the profile private, or better yet, access it as the user. **Any ideas on what to do/who to contact/how to actually get any sort of support from Instagram!?**

I  started my first instagram account just before going to University and  stopped using the account just before leaving, eventually creating  another one (since deleted) and then another one which is more fitting  for my current personal and professional life.

As  expected in those (literally) halcyon days of filtered life, the  Instagram feed in general - although not awful - is not necessarily  something I want just sitting there for all to see. As the TL:DR  suggests, when I log in - with the correct password - I am locked out by  the need for a 6 digit code.

Maybe this was stupid but nothing has worked.

Has  anyone experienced anything similar to this? I'm sure I've sent off  several reports and emails to instagram but of course nothing ever comes  back. Would massively appreciate any sort of help here - even if it's  just how to get in touch with SOMEONE at Instagram. I'm in the UK as  well if that makes any sort of difference.

f8hhht,curate-hashtags,Finding the perfect niche hashtags to skyrocket your Instagram content üöÄ,"Using hashtags on Instagram is pretty easy.

Hit the # key, start typing and you are on your way.

Only if it were that simple‚Ä¶ üò®

Instagram does a great job of making it seamless and quick to add hashtags to your content. No matter how much time you spend thinking of the best hashtags to use, they will always bring in a least a few new eyes to your content.

But there‚Äôs a catch.¬†üò≤

The difference between using a set or two of hashtags that on the surface seem to fit your content vs. finding the perfect niche hashtags for your brand can be a game-changer.

Hashtags are easy to use but hard to master. Most people use them, see some results but then can‚Äôt seem to take it to the next level. By spending more time thinking about your overall hashtag strategy you can still make it.

Don‚Äôt give up! üò≠

Let‚Äôs cover¬†[seven unique Instagram strategies](https://www.blog.curate-app.com/finding-the-perfect-niche-hashtags-to-skyrocket-your-instagram-content/) to help shape your mastery of using hashtags to grow your brand.

f8he1k,cxrruptgaming,{help} sudden drop in *HOME* engagement,"So I started my instagram 10 weeks ago roughly, and in those 10 weeks I've managed to grind up to 4K followers.

When I was at 3.2k followers I got roughly 400 likes &amp; 1.4k views WITHOUT hashtag results.

In the past 5 days , I had gained like (800)ish REAL followers. (I've never paid for any likes or follows, nothing like that).

Now that I'm at 4k, recently having gained 800 active followers interested in my content, all of a sudden I'm getting 800 views. I've noticed that my hashtags are still working (150+ impressions minimum); but my HOME impressions have dropped from 2200 to 1,000 - EVEN THOUGH I JUST GAINED 800 Followers.

So I gained 800 real active followers but my \*HOME\* impressed more than halved?

5 days ago I decided to test out instagrams ad promotions on one of my posts (I'm a gaming page); and I put like $25 into it for 5 days or something. It got the post 6k views, which is no big deal. 

\*edit\* : want to clarify here - the 800 follower increase wasn't entirely due to the ad, I would estimate that the instagram promotion itself got me around 200 of those followers. The rest was from some big pages reposting my content

Other than the AD messed up my engagement, I literally cant find an explanation.

I stopped the instagram AD immediately  &amp; its been about 72 hours since. (i post daily, so that's been 3 posts with low views).

A large majority of people are claiming my posts aren't showing up on their feeds.

Just for insight my page is actually u/cxrruptgaming so you can see for yourself what the numbers look like.

&amp;#x200B;

just to clarify - I'm stilling receiving over 500 impressions from hashtags on all my posts, but my ""home"" impressions have gone BYEBYE - (and i have extremely active &amp; interested followers. over 100 unique comments on most posts).

f8gcjy,HeyCouldYallHelpMe,Errors with recovering a Temporarily Disabled Account,"Hey,

So I temporarily disabled my Instagram account about a month and a half ago, and I'm trying to recover it now. I forgot my password, and only have my phone number connected to the account and not my email. This shouldn't be a problem, since I was able to get through the 'forgot password' section on mobile using either my username or my phone number, both send a link to reset my password to my phone. But, when I click the link, it brings me to an Instagram page saying that the account doesn't exist, or that an error is occurring. 

The mobile app recognizes my username and phone number, but when I try to do this through desktop, it doesn't recognize the username, and says that an error has occurred when I use my phone number. So, clearly the profile is still in the system to some capacity- so I didn't accidentally permanently erase my account a few months back (I also distinctly remember it being a temporary disabling), yet I'm still not able to access the account. Instagram's Help Center doesn't make any mention of what to do with an error like this, and any hope of directly contacting their support is basically nonexistent.

The specific error messages are: ""oops an error occurred"" (when no page loads whatsoever), ""Error: No user found. Please request a new password"" reset link"" (when I'm taken to the password reset page), and "" We have encountered an error while resetting your password. Please try again."" (when trying to recover it from desktop. I promise that, yes, I've tried again, a good number of times)

If anyone has any idea what I can do to get my account back, I'd be happy to hear it. Thanks.",0,1582493802,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f8gcjy/errors_with_recovering_a_temporarily_disabled/,Instagram,1

* Can't search username unless typed in all characters

Basic context:

* Small (560 followers) **\*anime\*** (OC) meme page for 1 year
* Post frequency: 1\~2 a day
* Gotten 3 of my posts and 2 stories deleted for offensive language and adult content. 
* Had confirmed shadowban, but no warning received for 4 months
* I did get the hashtag ban removed

the issue here is that it seems like I'm removed from username search priority

\[not a promotion!\] username: gae\_rick

I used to be able to search it just by typing ""gae"" or ""gaerick"" with other accounts before my most recent deletion, but now I can't find it unless I type in all the characters. This is a case when I try to tag myself or when I try to search it in explore tab. 

I'm aware of my account violating the community guidelines many times, but I'm not going to violate it any further since I finally understood what's completely safe to post.

Sooooo what's the deal then?

f82h9k,Circleofbones,Started a new Instagram for my photography," 

Hey everyone!

Today I decided to make a separate Instagram account for my photography, along with a new email for photography only. Give myself a more professional vibe.

I suppose I didn't really have to because I used my personal account to post my photos. But after having that account for so long, it has accumulated a lot of random accounts and I felt starting fresh was better than deleting everything and starting over.

Anyways, the predicament that I am in now is, I don't know what they best way to start posting.

I  have been shooting band photos (promotional and live) since September of last year. I was thinking of starting there, with my first shoot and going all the way up to the most recent shoot I've done.

Should I fill a grid and then post individually after that?

Or should I do a HUGE photo dump and add everything up until the most recent show I shot?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

TLDR: started new Instagram account specifically for my photography. Don't know the best way to fill my page.",3,1582421624,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f82h9k/started_a_new_instagram_for_my_photography/,Instagram,1

f7vcm6,MrEca,I messed up,"Let me tell you what I have done step by step
- Temporary deactivated my account
- Created a new account with the same number I used for my deactivated account
- Decided to reactivate my older account
- None of the codes, including backup codes didn't work in 2 factor authentication
- Could not remove the phone number from the new account so deleted it, I'm stuck now

Ok so how could have I known that Instagram wouldn't let me to use my phone number for multiple accounts, or maybe even create a new account with a used number?

Sent support form twice. In the first one they said they have disabled my account. In the second one they sent a 5 digit code and asked me to write it on a paper and my name with my full face to send it. They also said I could use my 2 factor authentication or backup codes which I already told that they didn't work.

f7v5ga,BermudaDreieck,Instagram banned instantly after sending pornographic video in Direct Message,"Hello, 2 days ago I suddenly got signed out of my instagram right when I have sent a pornographic video to someone in DM's. And later the person told me he didn't even receive the video. Seems like it got automatically detected and prevented from even sending.

My account disappeared for people, for one person my name completely disappeared in DM's but not for another person. So you cant find me in search and my link says ""User not found"". When requesting password reset it also says ""No User found"". Also I only can sign in when using my username, with my email it doesn't find the account as well.

When I tried to login again it said my 2FA Auth code is invalid. Same for the Recovery codes. With recovery codes it can be possible that they were related to an old account though.

Till that time I didn't even know whats going on because there was no information about anything at all.

Yesterday I then did fill the form to restore 2FA Authentication and I got an instant email where it says my account got disabled.

Today I filled the form again because I didn't get a mail about 2FA recovery. I instantly got the mail with instructions to send a photo of me. Didn't do it yet though

**I would like to know how I can know if I got permanently banned or temporary. Since I cant get further than to 2FA Auth I cant receive a popup that tells me more informations.**",0,1582390522,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f7v5ga/instagram_banned_instantly_after_sending/,Instagram,1

f7prha,Quavers809,Gaining followers on Instagram,"So on Twitter, Tumblr, and Insta, I have an art account that I want to grow. I just hit my first 1000 on Insta and I'm currently growing my Twitter and Tumblr pages as well. I'm trying to start a business for the future and I'm wondering if my process is unseemly or an unscrupulous way to growing it: 

In between posts, I prefer to like a f*ckton of of posts that I give no real thought to. I just like them. Going down and down to multiple tags until I either run out of likes or I get tired of liking. Usually it's about 5 hours of liking. Sometimes I stop and admire a particular piece or photo, sometimes I comment leaving a compliment and a ""‚ù§Ô∏è"", other times I'll share it, or do all three. I don't like going slow with things (as much as I can help it) and I want to grow my pages as fast as possible. This seems to be working and beating whatever algorithm they have that lessens artists' viewership. 

However, when people see I do this or I tell them, they laugh. Mockingly. I don't know why. Is this the wrong way to do this? Is this as unscrupulous as they make me think it is? I don't HAVE to look at every single piece, just the ones I like. Liking someone's post isn't going to I go to the ""recents"" where the artists are beginners and honestly not as good as others I've seen and not as good for my skill level or taste. But I still leave a like. 

Isn't that the point tho at base? They don't know what I'm doing. All they see is that they got a like. Sometimes I go on their profile and like a bunch of their pictures even if I don't particularly care for their work overall. A like is superficial to me and just a way for me to grow my profile and get people to interact with me and my art. Socializing as I've learned seems to be, ""Do for others first, and they'll do for you."" This strategy takes from that, but it's mocked. I spread the love. I give a like. But people make fun of it. Like...I get like and follower income. For about a month, I'd get ~15 or more followers a week doing this. My account just recently reached 1K and I want to keep going. But doing this seems to turn people off. Is it smart? Is it stupid? Are they jealous? Am I wrong? I don't know. I'm gonna keep doing it as much as I can.

f7nssh,catussucculent,"[Discussion] The future of instagram, should we abandon it?","With the rise of instagram‚Äôs monetization via ads/influencers and with Instagram‚Äôs fight against bots making the platform increasingly restrictive... do you think Instagram will prevail? What will it take for you to abandon the app? When the app rolled out in the early 2010‚Äôs it was fun, fresh and a nice way to share photos. But it seems like people have become chained to the app. That ‚Äúfun‚Äù and ‚Äúfresh‚Äù element is missing. It seems as if every new update comes with more restrictions on user actions (i.e: limit on liking, commenting,)  than before. I understand that Instagram wants ‚Äúorganic‚Äù engagement with their users, but it has seemly become absurdly restrictive. Anyone trying to build an online brand/presence from scratch today may feel like its impossible to grow a large audience with just hashtags. ‚ÄúUse hashtags‚Äù they say, but really? The average IG person is no pro marketer. And with an ocean of YouTube tutorials of Instagram gurus‚Äô contradicting views/advice of what to do and not do to grow an audience is extremely overwhelming. It‚Äôs ridiculous in my opinion, that IG users have to worry about the most tiny thing to avoid being ‚Äúshadow banned‚Äù or flat out banned from the app. Thoughts?",21,1582347054,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f7nssh/discussion_the_future_of_instagram_should_we/,Instagram,1

f7nelp,kaitxoxoxo,Trying to find an account,Hey there! I used to remember seeing and viewing a popular Instagram account on my feed all the time! It was close to a million followers I believe and mostly all the posts were about early 1970‚Äôs-to now posts about different Hollywood actors and singers. The poster of this account was always giving detailed descriptions and her instagram account was amazing for these descriptions. She was feature in vogue for the account but I cannot remember the name! Help!!,2,1582344959,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f7nelp/trying_to_find_an_account/,Instagram,1

f7n9he,eliteshades,Taking pictures by yourself using a tripod + bluetooth remote? Does anyone do this? Does anyone get self-conscious if people see you doing it?,"I don't really have a lot of friends that can tag along and take pics of me. My personal instagram has only a few photos and I havent posted in many months because I don't have any friends that can take photos of me.

So i was wondering if any of you use a tripod + bluetooth remote to take pics? And if you do, do you only use it in remote places because it'd be ackward if you pull out a tripod and start taking pics by yourself in a crowded area.",1,1582344242,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f7n9he/taking_pictures_by_yourself_using_a_tripod/,Instagram,1
f7mhtq,Endoxa,Ghost accounts adding me to groups,"I have a private account on Instagram, I keep it private because I‚Äôm in the MJ/Hemp Industry. Friends and family under 100 people. I never conduct any business over the platform and everything I do is legit. 

I‚Äôve has it happen twice where I‚Äôll get a message that says ‚ÄúDave Faggon has added you to a group‚Äù.  But when I open Instagram there‚Äôs nothing and that account doesn‚Äôt come up in a search. Is it Instagram admins adding me to hidden lists or is it Law Enforcement? I didn‚Äôt even know you could make lists of accounts? Thank you for your time.",0,1582340355,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f7mhtq/ghost_accounts_adding_me_to_groups/,Instagram,1
f7m7n9,mattisagamer10,Messages in a group chat are disappearing,"So I'm in this group chat with like 15+ people (one of those story add to chat things), regardless messages I've sent in the past just disappear from the chat, as well as other people's messages in the chat. It's seemingly random as to what stays and what doesn't, but pics/vids sent through the camera thing (not the select from gallery thing) seem to stay, only the keep in chat ones of course. Some messages reappear but most stay gone. What's up with this? Googling has given me no reliable info. This is just another reason I hate instagram.",4,1582338938,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/f7m7n9/messages_in_a_group_chat_are_disappearing/,Instagram,1
