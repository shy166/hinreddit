fso0iz,JonahFalcon,Trying to view box scores in MyCareer," So... trying to look at the box score of a game just played... I can't.   
 

I see a tab for ""MyPlayer Nation""... oh, multiplayer. Why would I care? I  have zero interest in multiplayer. Why would I care about people called  ""Th3 Gr8 x MaTT"" or ""Horse x God3838""?   
 

Ok, Pro-Am has stats... for more users I couldn't give a rat's patoot about.  
 

Well, obviously the tab Stats should help...   
 

Team Stats... er... doesn't help. Oh, View Team Card. Okay...  Schedule/Results, there we go!... and.... nothing. It just shows results  and doesn't show the actual box score.  
 

What.  
 The.  
 Heck?!

fsnh5e,DaVanillaGori11a,Play Now Online is low-key amazing,"I have been spending my time on 2k20 mostly on Myteam. I enjoy it for the most part, but the game gets stale really quickly... Even with buying VC or going budget. I find I am just playing the game to progress and not actually having fun.

So out of boredness I finally tried play now online and I havent had this much fun in 2k since 2k20. Whether its destroying kids on team control or actually trying to play real ball on player control, I feel like I am finally playing a  basketball simulation. And I have found that if you have a mic and get matched up with stupid selfish teammates, all you gotta do is just talk like you are playing real pick-up. No need to trash on stupid kids, just coach em. Even if they playing dumb and costing you the game, you don't really lose progress. You got so many games to get to the next round. But when you get teammates that wanna play team ball... that's the best thing ever. I finally feel like 2k has a game mode about Basketball and not progression and it makes me so happy.

Sorry about the rant, but I am so happy right now lol.

fsmges,gettinmojo,"2k20 animations need yonbe watered down, honestly 2k19 was better as far as getting by defenders and badges ...etc","for example------ you jump in the ball handlers face, 10% contested, your defender just looks at you, 78% contest

A pg  cannot dribble down the court on a fastbreak without a center flashing in front of everyone forcing animations where he stops you from behind and you pick up the ball.

Defenders can jump 5 feet away in the paint forcing more ""animations"" just to block your shot.

Giannis plays like a point guard in mycareer

Your player picks up the ball for no apparent reason

Cpu can hold intense d from 5 feet away forcing you to pick the ball up, once again

You run away from a screen, the screen animation sucks you in anyways

Your trash aaf without badges

In mycareer a rookie cpu with 68 ovr has 27 badges???like wtf

x2 boost for any vc, attributes, store discounts dont actually apply like it says it does

The park is always dark

Park games run smooth until your teammate passes you the ball and all of a sudden, lag spikes and delayed movements

Mycareer Ai are mindreaders that know exactly where your going every second

I pass the ball, Ai is still causing animations and sticking to me like glue, like bruh chill i dont even have the dam ball anymore

Ai boxouts are attrocious 

Lanes feel clogged and cant move around naturally and freely

Cpu can spin and turn on a dime, but everytime u switch directions your players does some weird madden defense straffe thats slow asf

98% chance on the freethrow, full white, down by 1 and missed just so the opposing Ai team could win the finals

Ben simmons hitting contested threes

Player movement is slow asf

Your player will get the gatorade symbol just after 2 minutes in the 1st quarter, fatigue rlly needs to be buff

Your player doesnt react to your joystick untill 5 seconds later, causing missed shots, layups, and getting stuck in 3 sec violations",3,1585692381,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fsmges/2k20_animations_need_yonbe_watered_down_honestly/,NBA2k,3

Make body contact  and get him to  post you up  at this point Keep Flicking the  stick up and  pray 2k gives you the animation when he backs you down.   the 3 outcomes i gotten was,

- he  will mistime his  post move or get the  wrong  move leading to a miss.
- he will fall  or  go out of bounds leading to a  turnover
- 2k will  make him  fall but stay inbounds leading to an open bucket.

fsketb,Wojie,"Switch vs PS4 input ""lag""","TLDR: input lag caused by large dead zones on analog sticks.

Hey all, I was recently getting frustrated with the input lag going from PS4 to Switch, they feel very different. After doing some comparisons, the lag is caused by the large dead zones in the analog sticks on Switch. If you go to calibrate you can move the sticks a small amount and see them move, unfortunately when playing the game your character will not move with small movements... Compared to PS4, your character will move. If I had to guess this is to combat the Switch joy-con drift issue. Unfortunately it makes for a very shitty play experience. A nice fix would be for 2k to give us an option to set how far the Dead Zone is.",0,1585685888,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fsketb/switch_vs_ps4_input_lag/,NBA2k,1

fskbum,Jellybean21805,How I made MyLeague an amazing experience,"(Disclaimer: I‚Äôm on mobile so forgive the formatting, and I know most of you won‚Äôt care about this)

So about a week back I was stuck in quarantine and hopped on some myleague for the first time in about a month. You see, I got really burnt out and ran out of things to do. I chose the T-Wolves and hopped straight into a game and Malik Beasley goes off for about 35-ish points... and repeats it many times. Beasley finishes the season at around 22/3/4 and in a playoff game (we were the 7th seed) caps off a sweep against the #2 seeded Lakers by making 10 threes in that game (we got lost 4-1 the next round to the Rockets lol.) But this got me thinking about cool storylines that could happen. I checked out Beasley‚Äôs personality attributes and saw a really low loyalty and really high financial security, so I came up with a storyline where Beasley goes off and by the trade deadline he demands a trade and it becomes a Harden-esque situation (except Beasley becomes sort of a villain type) where Beasley becomes really good and a franchise star for whoever I trade him to. I haven‚Äôt quite worked out how I will make that work out yet, but the point of this rambling is to say that I am super interested in myleague again because I‚Äôm going to come up with cool storylines in my head depending on what randomness occurs and I have many other ideas, therefore many, many hours of enjoyable myleague left to play.",6,1585685629,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fskbum/how_i_made_myleague_an_amazing_experience/,NBA2k,2

When I made the and one to tie it that was the most hype I've ever been in any solo basketball game. After all Che had gone through the narrative really added to that moment. But after the fact I was wondering if this sort of thing was planted or at the very least my ability to make that shot was coded to be easier. 

For context, I hadn't added any stats to Che because honestly I didn't think I could - when I started the season I found that out. This is the first 2k game since the Dreamcast ones and I'm not very good - this game is way more complicated. I picked this game up because of the Corona lockdown and I'm glad I did!

Playing myGM with 2K19 with the Celtics.  Jaylen Brown is my starting SG and I want to move him to the bench.  Game plan has been updated and in a real game he does come off the bench.  The problem is in a scrimmage.  No matter what, he plays with the starters, and I quit out and check the global plan and it shows he‚Äôs on the second team (6 man actually).

Crazy thing is any other player I can successfully  sub out.  I put Marcus Smart as the 2, SG, and when the scrimmage loaded up, he‚Äôs on the second team and Brown the first.  Like there is some setting tied to Jaylen Brown.  Adaptive is off.  Lineup mgt is off.  And as I said, I can swap out anyone but him.

Gonna try moving him to SF and see if I can start another SG.  Confirming could be tied to him.  One possible note is that I did practice with Brown in freestyle to try to learn his shot.  Only other player was my starting PG.

Not sure if a bug or something I‚Äôm to dim witted to see.   Any thoughts or help appreciated!!! üòâ",3,1585668875,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fsf0sa/nba2k_demoting_starter_in_mygm_scrimmage/,NBA2k,1

First time NBA 2K player here! Been playing quite a few MyCareer mode games got my player up to around low 80s and followed a Shooter build guide on YouTube. I'm struggling vs anyone in the Neighbourhood and was wondering if anyone has any good tips to improve?

Also would anyone be willing to join me for a few games to show me what's what as I find the MyCareer games not too bad but against other players online I just get destroyed.

frxyum,TeamSHURBIN,ESL Gaming screwed me out of prize money and I don't know what to do,"Not your typical post here and not really sure if I'll find help, but hear me out:

I'm playing in an NBA 2k20 tournament for about 6 hours yesterday, and I can't connect to my next opponent via the in-game matchmaking from ESL (it had encountered this problem a lot in the past). We file a protest and ask the admin what to do. The admin says to play a private match instead (I've done this before successfully). We try, but my opponent's game crashes every time he accepts an invite from me. He never sends me an invite to try to play.

We are explaining what is happening the whole time to the admin in the protest. After about 15 minutes, and with no warning, the admin tells us it has been too long and we are both disqualified. The admin posts:

""The technical problems of each player must be resolved as quickly as possible, ESL can not be held responsible.""

Frankly I don't understand how ESL cannot be held responsible when the matchmaking system is literally their responsibility.

I file a support ticket, and another admin tries to claim I wasn't present. From every angle you look at it, I was in fact present throughout the whole process. The admin then says there is nothing they can do, I'm disqualified, and that I should ""just be more careful next time.""

The worst part is, they awarded my opponent the win for that match, even though they were the ones having trouble connecting to me. They gave them the default win, which placed them rank 9-16 and awarded them $100. If we had just played that game and I won, I would have gotten the $100 and possibly more if I kept winning. But I was disqualified for something that was out of my control.

I really don't know what to do, this is my first time using ESL.

TL,DR: Played in a tournament, got disqualified because my opponent couldn't connect, my opponent got the prize money not me",3,1585598230,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/frxyum/esl_gaming_screwed_me_out_of_prize_money_and_i/,NBA2k,1

That being said, I see every post scorer in this community hyping up contact. I put it on hof for a bit, but noticed that I stopped relying on my skills. Instead, I began just trying to go up on people. It‚Äôs some kind of fucked up cognition. I don‚Äôt like using dunks down low in general, so the badge just seems inapplicable.  

I really just want to be able to make a shot after I create space in the post. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs best for that, but I love drop stepper and dream shake. I almost never get contested on my shots; yet they still brick.

I hope I‚Äôm making sense here, as I feel I play in a somewhat unique way as a big. I don‚Äôt drive, so slithery wouldn‚Äôt make sense.

How does Luka Donƒçiƒç only have 95 ovr card in NBA 2k20? Something has to be done about this. Luka Donƒçiƒç is probably the only player who has a higher overall base card in the regular game (96) than the highest overall in MyTeam (95).

These are top player in the NBA according to the ESPN poll:

i want a 6'8 SF or SG that can (obviously) lock up centers in the post, and (maybe?) defend iso? this is strictly a 2s build. i've messes around in the player builder but can only get pass first wings, rebounding wing or perimeter lockdown... i know i know, i shouldn't limit the build i want to make based on the archetype name, but if somebody could help me make a mid range specialist i'd appreciate it.   
i'm just bored of isoing with my playmaker.. i want to be the corner bitch now lmao. at least i'll green every shot, since i keep getting sold :)

Why is it that players from the original series of "" '20 Current NBA "" who have between a 90 and 75 overall, sell for anywhere between 500 and 1000 MT Coins, but players who are between 75 and 70 go for at least 1,500 and sometimes even up to 3 or 4 thousand?

Remember in NBA 2K14, LeBron: Path to Greatness? It was essential a mode allowing you to try and replicate LeBron‚Äôs performances in career defining games and make career defining decisions. A mode like this has been absent since that year. My idea?

2K, get back in your shit and give us something great. Take NBA legends and today‚Äôs greats and give us the option to start their careers from the beginning. I‚Äôm talking MJ, Larry, Magic, Dr. J, Kobe, Shaq... Even guys like Dominique, J-Kidd, Pippen, Ewing (not that they were slouches or anything). And then of course the greats of today with obvious choices like LeBron, Steph, KD, Russ... Allow us to take over 10-20 to dare I even say 30 moments for the GOATs. Let us make those career defining decisions. I would play THE SHIT out of that if you guys pulled it off the right way. No VC or DLC. Cut the crap.

I get it. It‚Äôs a lot of work, but let‚Äôs be honest, the graphics right now aren‚Äôt probably gonna get much better anytime soon. Regardless of what you do with MyCareer it‚Äôs gonna be corny and cringey. But personally, I think this mode could be a savior for the true fans of the franchise and of the NBA in general.

Let me know what you guys think. Also if you guys have any idea on how to do this in a makeshift way on 2K20, lemme know.",1,1585548440,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/frlfp4/new_idea_for_a_mode_in_2k21/,NBA2k,1

frk97p,cactus_mom28,Fr my team kinda sucks.,"I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô11 Center for the Raptors, second year basketball after coming off a huge loss with the team, we didn‚Äôt even make the playoffs. I‚Äôve improved a lot since last season, I now average 13.2 ppg, 4.4 rebounds and 3.2 assists. I always get over ten points per game, every single time now. I work as hard as I can to defend, maybe one or two defensive breakdowns in a game, but it‚Äôs kinda rare. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm super super good, but I think I‚Äôm alright as an 83 overall. 

My team however, I really think they‚Äôre the downfall of my career. I love the players on my team in real life, yet none of the explosiveness seems to come into the game. I mean, Pascal Siakam literally only averages 4 ppg in this season right now. We‚Äôre always on losing streaks, we sit last in the east, 2-11 and lose games by around 20-10 points. Most of the differential always comes from when I‚Äôm on the bench, like the simulation parts of the game just want us to lose. 

I‚Äôm really just wondering if there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôm doing wrong, like is there something I‚Äôm missing when it comes to team wins? My team chemistry is maxed, but sometimes they just keep making bad plays, costing us the game. Yeah, sometimes a game may be my fault, like I miss a critical shot, but damn, they just seem to be looking for losses sometimes.

I play Madden all the time but wasn't prepared for the difficulty curve. After a week of grinding I feel I've gotten alot better but still would love some help from you vets

I built a 6'2 PG inside-out playmaker with 81 ovr. I like to attack the rim but am often getting stuffed by centers and not consistent on my finishes. What badges should I get to boost my %? Also I try to get as many assists as possible by half the time I seem to turn the ball over on pass or alley oop attempts 

Currently have 5 finishing badges: bronze consistent finisher, bronze giant slayer, bronze slithery finisher and silver contact finisher 

For my 4 shooting badges I have bronze flexible release, bronze range extender and silver quick draw

Only have 2 bronze playmaker badges, quick first step and dimer

I'm up for new badges in all 3 categories and was wondering if y'all had any input on how I should change around my badges to be better at my position. Not sure if I left out any info that would be helpful

freowe,njmartybrodeur30,How to adjust from offline to online for big?,"I only started playing the online multiplayer version of the game about 2 weeks ago.  Obviously you can't play online the way you would in the offline MyCareer.  As a big, I can do fine on defense, rebounding, and outlet passing, but scoring is a big challenge.  Most inside shots will be contested AF if you go in looking to chuck.  Defenders are also ready to aggressively spam steal, so posting up with back to the basket feels much less available than in the offline mode.

I've so far ""adapted"" by essentially looking to score as little as needed.  A few buckets here and there, and otherwise focus on defense, rebounding, and passing.  That *can* work so long as the team has other good scorers... but if my team doesn't have great scorers, I can't even look to defer to better options, and I wind up feeling like a pylon on offense.

So what practical tips can people offer for big man offense online, if you're mostly used to the offline MyCareer?  I appreciate the help!

frdiu4,YaNansBox,Matchmaking in Rec + Steals,"Anyone else think that matchmaking should be loosely based on rep for rec?

I'm really tired of joining a rec game with my friends and matching against Elites and Legends who have like 70+ Days logged on a game that came out in September. I play 2k a lot and consider my friends and I above average players (93-99 rating AS2-SS3 range) but the difference between us and these sweat teams is so ridiculous. 

We don't play pro/am either cause we don't consistently have 5 players. Also I'm pretty sure proam matchmaking is just as awful. If that's not the case I would try it but I don't think they ever fixed it.

These games destroy your will to play. They're all using 2-way builds and aggressively playing zone which results in an automatic steal for every pass you make that isn't perfect. I'm not sure what the answer is to fixing steals and interceptions but if you know what I'm talking about you know those games look like some weird augmented form of basketball that's just so far from real life. 

On the rare occasion when you actually match with a team that's similarly rated in ovr + rep, those are by far the most fun games for everyone involved.

Should I play mycareer games or player nation? Should I sim to a certain point or play all the games?

After a timeout, the CPU teammate often passes you the ball when you're trying to get open without asking for it. But when you get open and ask for the ball, they don't pass to you.

[This is a perfect example](https://streamable.com/gn2ju): We're down 2. I set a screen for my brother (L. James) to get him open for a lob pass. My brother smash the triangle button but Mcgee doesn't even try to lob him.

Let us select the inbounders after a timeout. In the previous case, Mcgee wasn't the best player for that kind of play. There were much better options. 

Can we at least force the CPU to obey our commands? Because it's frustrating to watch the CPU ignoring our pass requests or giving us the ball when we don't ask for it.

I've seen the AI just go insane trying to make the game more difficult, which forces me to takeover.  I can deal with all of that, but in these finals, I've had to force quit what feels like 20 games now.  Nothing I do matters. 

Game 1 in LA, 160 - 110.... I scored 57, 12 steals, and 17 assists.  Held Lebron to under 20.  I took over 3 times with A+ grade.  Doesn't matter.  I sit out for 4 min, and they scored 30 unanswered.  I keep the game because of the stat line, and think I'll get em next game.

NOPE!  

I had the game down to 1 possession with a minute to go in the game.  I fouled out, so I think, let's see what happens.  20 flipping points in 1 minute!!! I force quit that, walk away and try again later.  I'm now 0-2 in the finals. I've moved the difficulty to pro, and the same stuff is still happening. 

My players can't make wide open shots while I'm doubled and tripled. They can't rebound, they don't play defense.  I've looked into my settings, my rotations, my playbooks to try and get people open.  None of it works.  I've been stuck in the finals now for a solid week, and the game is becoming an issue.  I hate the idea of rage quitting, but this is a crappy mess.  

I've looked around here for help with other peoples posts.  I'm stuck and I can't stand having to play through another season and hope they break up these guys.  I also don't like the idea of having to go to the Lakers just so I don't have to play them.

fqu569,Vulture_213,MyLEAGUE: Too many losses towards the end of the season.,"So everytime I play a season of MyLEAGUE in 2k20 my team does pretty good during the first half of the season (mostly before the all star break). After that my team just sucks and cant win a single game.
I had a team that went 40-13 before the break then after the break we went 11-18. I had another team that was just above .500 and had a record of 28-24 and after the break we went 3-27 and had a 20 game losing streak and our final record was 31-51. Then another team went 45-7 before the break and our final record was 55-27 meaning we went 10-20 after the break. Theres been other instances of this happening but it would take forever to name all of them.
At first I thought maybe it could be that my teams are just getting tougher schedules after the break but I quickly shut that idea down because everytime i looked at the schedule it didnt look too hard and we were getting blown out by the worst teams in the league.
I just wanna know if anyone else is having this problem and if anyone knows a solution because it's getting pretty annoying that my team does so good in the first half and can't buy a win in the second half.",1,1585434615,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fqu569/myleague_too_many_losses_towards_the_end_of_the/,NBA2k,1

fqsqlm,icee-,Terrible A.I. / Teammate Grading System,"In MyCareer, I decided to make a center build on the Clippers. This is my first time touching the MyCareer, and I already realize how unbelievably terrible the teammate A.I. is. Like, absolutely awful.

They won't pass when I'm wide open, or have a clear look. Kawhi just stands there getting double teamed, and passes to a bad shooter who's being covered heavily. I understand you need to build trust in teammates, but it just gets ridiculous. The defensive A.I. on your team are just awful, and will double team at the worst times, leaving someone open for a basket. 

As for the opponent A.I., I can never tell what's a smart matchup. Sometimes some 75 overall turns into Joel Embiid, and does a thousand post moves, only to hit a 100% smothered layup. And the teammate grade is almost just as bad.

I genuinely love this game, but I seriously don't know why the most popular gamemode happens to be the least polished. I'll have my grade ruined because Mitchell Robinson randomly turns into Steph Curry. A man who has never made a three in his career, will ruin my grade because I give him a few feet on the perimeter.

fqfqwe,NotJackWilliams,2K20 Scripts Random Offline Games,"This game has officially made me Mad Online‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

I‚Äôve been playing 2K since 2K10 and it blows my mind every year how bad the newest game is. 

I play on the easiest difficulty and I don‚Äôt really care if I lose. In fact, I like losing every so often because it makes my record look more realistic, rather than if I went 82-0. That being said, I usually win by over 30 points and my player normally gets 35+ Points and 10+ Assists with ease.

But the way I lost this game bothered me so much, I can‚Äôt shake the rage. I could not beat the Raptors to save my life. Kyle Lowry had 25+ points in the second half and every single one of them was a heavily contested three or a floater in traffic with a green release somehow. We‚Äôre talking about Kyle Lowry here.

In the second quarter of this same game, Serge Ibaka went out of the game with an injury and they commentators said he wouldn‚Äôt return. Somehow, he had a miraculous recovery and came back into the game and got Player of the Game. Over Lowry. And Lowry scored well over 30, so despite not seeing his stats, I‚Äôm assuming Ibaka had 40 something points. 

My player, on the other side of this, could not hit a shot if his life depended on it. As I said, I play on the easiest difficulty and generally shoot around 60-70% overall and over 50% from three. In this game, I went 0/5 from three and 7/20 shooting. The only shots I made were wide open layups or dunks. My player was bricking wide open mid range and three point shots with good releases. I actually went to make sure that my attributes didn‚Äôt somehow get reset after the game. 

Another weird thing worth mentioning is that my player was being double teamed every possession in the second quarter when I had four points and 4 assists. This happens frequently when I‚Äôm on a scoring run, but I was playing horrible and was 2/9 at that point.

At the end of the game, my team was making a comeback effort and my player bricks a WIDE OPEN shot that would have put us within 2 points with a minute left. We stop them on the next possession, then upon rebounding their missed shot, my player starts dribbling into an animation where he loses the ball and they get it. My teammate then intentionally fouls and the game is pretty much over.

This animation caused two of my three turnovers in the game, and the third was a fast break where I lobbed the ball to Aaron Gordon with no defenders nearby and he did a half jump and let the perfect pass bounce and fall out of bounds. 

This game was so clearly scripted and it drives me insane. I don‚Äôt know why 2K does this but doesn‚Äôt openly admit to it. It‚Äôs not like my player really suffers at all, I still had 20 points and 17 assists. But why? It seems like I was playing on the highest difficulty when I was trying to score and defend. 

Does anyone know why this happens? Has this happened to anyone else or do I just suck?",3,1585381445,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fqfqwe/2k20_scripts_random_offline_games/,NBA2k,1

The sharp takeover would give me extra long range though and for sure a better green window as I‚Äôm heating up. It doesn‚Äôt give speed boosts or defensive though.

I'm so pissed that I don't remember, I wish you could purposely hurt a team's player. Because he makes my life hell by hitting it in my player's faces. Between my Stoki, Dumars, or even my HOF CLAMPS Michael Cooper from way back. And if I don't green it it doesn't go in. It's simple I can't green with a bench of rubies or worse! Fucking dumbass myteam challenge is way too hard. I already broke and had to fix my controller yesterday or the day before. And I'm still stuck on a mediocre ass team that's not much better than me. And by the way devs, fuck that bullshit you pulled by making it where I have to use 10 of a team's players. I beat that stupid Clippers team on my second try, but I don't know how many times I quit in the 4th quarter on this challenge because they made it too hard. Also, take that one dude off SF because we can't swap players around in positions they can't play. So you shouldn't have what's his name at the 3 when he should only be able to play SG and PG. Or did y'all go mental and forget that rule? I really want Ingram, Harden, and Siakam. But this shit's too hard, I'm not p2w or have the patience to snipe players 24/7 to have a good set of players for every fucking team. I did really want those 3 players, but I'm done with the bullshit. At least fix the rate of shots going in on the difficulty. Like my 3 PDs can barely get open and they apparently can't score on 2 players that actually suck at D, Ty and that SG dude on the Suns.

Is that how this game is suppose to be played? I tried it but it feels so weird running away from the ball handler lol. And when I run away and hide, the game doesn't play good defense for me. It lets my opponent make everything or gets out of their way and let them run right to the basket. So I feel like I have to guard my opponent because the game doesn't play defense for me for some reason. But it sure plays defense for my opponents.

fpnqx1,djasp3,A Better 2K21 MyCareer Mode,"(This is long, I'm halfway through typing this and I'm realizing no one really wants to read this shit, so skim through if you want to)

I'll start this off by saying this might not be a new idea or maybe its already been said or posted, but I've thought that MyCareer has needed something that would actually make people want to play it for more than a week to get badges and then just moving on to Park or The Rec. 

How about they somewhat combine MyCareer with a little bit of MyGM? (Since they absolutely murdered MyGM, which I'm irrationally upset about.)

So you start your MyCareer with those college games, but  you have another one of those rival players (Jackson Ellis type asshole) and you and your rival are no question going to be the #1 and #2 picks, two of the greatest prospects since LeBron type hype.

This is where it gets different. There are two new expansion teams being added to the league and have the #1 and #2 picks. After your college games, you go through the Draft Combine and throughout the whole thing, these two expansion teams meet with you and by the answers you give them, you get to decide which team drafts you.

One of the teams has a ""Win Now"" type of personality owner and GM. Think Daryl Morey Houston Rockets type of mindset. They will Trade draft picks and always try to make a run at the top free agent to try and move to the top.  The other team has a ""Build a Culture"" type personality. More of a rebuild team that values picks and wants to grow slower as a team. So you choose your Pre Draft Interview answers to pick which team you want to get drafted by.

Oh, good news, somehow the team who drafts you also has like the #7 pick or something like that and they want to know who you want to play with. Instead of just picking a player from the list, you get to build your new teammate. This way you can have your Shaq to your Kobe, or your Pippen to your MJ or whoever the hell you want to team up with. (Maybe not full customization, people are too dumb for this, just the position and general play style of him.)

Now once you are drafted, and since you're the bees knees, you get HEAVY input on what the team does or who they trade for/sign/draft. More than what you got in 2K20. 

For example instead of just saying ""Trade for Blake Griffin"" and then hoping to God they do the trade a few days later, you get the MyGM trade menu and you get to decide what/who to trade for the player you want. (And yes, your team won't just let you trade your whole team for Tacko Fall, there will be some realistic restrictions on the trades and on how many attempts you get.)  Another example, instead of realizing at the start of the game that your starting Center Rudy Gobert just got traded for broken down John Wall and wanting to throw your controller through the TV, the team brings you in and asks you what you think of trade offers before they ruin the whole team for you. Maybe after you've raised your teammate chemistry or just after year one you get to do stuff like that, including the free agency process.

Even if you decide you want to play with LeBron and AD on the Lakers or any other team, you'll still get input on everything, just making it more entertaining to play MyCareer.

I'm just talking out of my ass, so if there are any flaws or better ideas for this, just roast me and tell me what you think. I have more beef with MyCareer, but this is just about the actual story mode.

And yes I know that MyCareer is pretty limited to what they can do for the mode, and none of this will ever happen, but this is somewhat the type of content I hope for one day to make it less ""repetitive and grindy""",28,1585271323,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fpnqx1/a_better_2k21_mycareer_mode/,NBA2k,1

fpnlc2,kylekorver17,"NBA 2K20 MyTEAM- How 2K is Ruining a Great Game Mode, and How it can be Fixed","I would like to preface this by saying that I was planning on waiting until the end of the MyTeam cycle to post this, but because we're now getting end game cards in March, I figured I could post it now.

I have been playing MyTeam every year since 2K16, and I can say that I have genuinely enjoyed every year's version of the game mode (aside from 2K18, but we don't have to talk about that). The whole idea of being able to build a team that you can play with has always been my favorite way to enjoy the 2K games. For context, I play on Xbox, and I have put 557 hours into 2K20 MyTeam.  Although I have at times really enjoyed the game this year, I feel that there are several flaws that can, at times, ruin the experience of the game mode. 

First, we will start by looking at (what I feel) are the things that 2K20 MyTeam did **right**.

***The Good***

**Offline Content-** The amount of offline content available from day 1 was great. Similar to 2K19, we had Domination, Triple Threat, and some weekly/moments challenges. 

* Domination is what it is, I personally enjoyed it to an extent, but after playing the same game mode for 5 years, it got kind of old. Aside from the terrible player rewards (I will get into this later), Domination was actually pretty rewarding to finish. B
* Offline Triple Threat is, in my opinion, the best change from prior years. The game mode itself could admittedly be pretty mind numbing at times, but the rewards were pretty good, and it was great for grinding the evolution players while simultaneously giving the player the feeling that they were actually making progress in the mode. A-

**Spotlight Challenges-** I **loved** the addition of Spotlight Challenges. These were the perfect way to keep people engaged in the game mode, until they suddenly stopped making them (not including the new team-specific challenges). I feel like 2K finally found what they were missing to make their offline content enjoyable. Yes, it was a hell of a grind to get the rewards for finishing all of the games, and yeah, almost none of the Spotlight Evolution players/game 17 rewards are still viable to use. However, if these challenges kept being rolled out on a consistent basis, I think a lot of people would really enjoy playing the game mode more. I feel like these challenges are exactly what (primarily offline) players like myself have been asking for for years. A+

**Triple Threat Online-** If I'm being honest, I'd say that this mode is just *okay.* It's not a bad or boring mode by any means, but it's sort of just something to do in the game. The games usually take around 10-15 minutes, so it's not too big of a commitment to play. My only gripe with TTO is the BALL DROPS. My god, if there's anything in this game that frustrates me more than the gameplay, it's how long it takes to get your rewards after winning a game. My personal record for one ball drop is 2 minutes, which doesn't sound like much. But when you consider that that's roughly 10-20% of the time it takes to play an entire game, it becomes a bit much. Other than that, the rewards are good enough, and the mode itself is fun. B+

**The Little Things**

* **Card Art-** The card art this year is [great](https://2kmtcentral.com/img/20/players/generated/8627i1.png/cache-1581475508/8627i1.png). The moving animations on the cards look awesome, and they're not **too** much. A
* **User Interface/Menu-** Not much to say here, the MyTeam menu looks good and it's organized well enough, aside from a few small issues with flipping through collections. A-
* **Consistent Pack/Player Releases-** I think 2K has done a good job this year with the amount of new content we get every week. We'll usually get a small (4-8 players) drop every Tuesday, and a larger set every Friday. Other than the inconsistency of moments player releases, no complaints here. A-
* **Ability to Compete at a Moderate Level-** Another thing that I think is great this year is the gap between near-endgame cards and cheap, serviceable amethyst/diamond players. Building budget teams is *actually* fun this year, and competing with higher tier cards is much easier than in the past. This does not take into account the nearly game breaking S-tier cards, but progress is progress. B+

***The Bad***

**The Gameplay-** Both on and offline, the gameplay is so incredibly inconsistent and dependent on animations. I know this is old news, and I know that the MyTeam devs have little or no control over this stuff, but it sometimes feels like the winner of the game is determined by who gets the better animations, rather than who the better player is. I could write an entire post about how bad the gameplay is, but I'm sure everyone already knows the issues in this area. C-

**The Latency (input delay)-** I don't even know where to start with this. I've never played MyTeam on PS4 or PC, so I cannot speak from that perspective, but **wow.** The latency on Xbox is terrible. Sure, once you get used to it it's not *super* difficult to play through. However, I use a wired connection, and have never experienced latency to this extent on any other game I've played. I'm no expert on technology, so I have no idea what actually goes into making an online game run smoothly, I just think there is no excuse for a AAA developer like 2K to have a game with **that** much input delay. F

**MyTeam Unlimited-** In a vacuum, MTU is a good game mode. It has a very simple premise, and the rewards themselves are good. My main issue with the mode is the 12-0 system. Now, I completely understand that 2K *has* to make the reward cards hard to get. Like my personal favorite [supervillain](https://imgur.com/gallery/Xii95za) once said, ""If everyone is super, then no one will be."" If the 12-0 rewards were easy to get, there would be little replay value for the game mode. However, requiring players to win 12 straight games without losing is asking *way* too much of them. In 12 games, you're bound to play at least one game with a ton of lag, or a player with a full Galaxy Opal lineup. MTU is unfortunately on the receiving end of the consequences of a game that is structured to be pay to win, and it shows. Combine that with the latency and bad gameplay, and you have yourself a bad game mode. D+

**Position Locks-** I would like to start this off by saying that the MyTeam devs are fucking geniuses for coming up with this idea. Forcing players to be put into certain positions was recognized by myself as a cash grab right from the beginning, and it worked. Players are pouring 400K+ MT into taller guys like Lebron, Giannis, and Ben Simmons who are eligible at PG. This was genius on 2K's part, as I'm sure they make a considerable chunk of their revenue from MyTeam from packs containing these players. But, as I stated before, this only promotes a pay to win structure, and takes a lot of fun out of the game for broke college kids like myself. D- 

**Packs-** I'm going to try to refrain from complaining about the pack odds. Believe it or not, it's actually great for the game when the pack odds are bad. It gives players incentive to not buy packs, and to grind their way to getting their favorite players. Sure, you can take the easy way out and drop hundreds of dollars to get a certain player, but what's the fun in that? Well, for 2K, the fun begins with every new pack drop. It's no secret that packs yield good players much more frequently in the first hour or so of their release than any other time (Note: this could just be speculation, but from personal experience, as well as hearing what Youtubers/members of the community have said, there definitely seems to be a pattern). For me, the pack odds themselves are not of concern, but rather that it appears 2K has the ability to alter the odds for packs at will. 

Another problem with packs is their price. For example, the new Campus Legend Deluxe packs cost **17,500 MT.** *That is a lot of MT.* In past years, 2K has shown that it can be profitable while still having pack costs lower. If this trend continues, I worry that 2K could lose a lot of players due to the perception that the mode is constructed to force you to spend money to even compete. Along with this, as many others have noticed, there are certainly times when the non-deluxe packs yield much better players. Again, I will try to not complain about pack odds, but this comes off as a shady business tactic, and is borderline bait &amp; switch. C

**Miscellaneous Bad Things**

**Evolution Cards-** In the beginning, evolution cards were great. They were really fun to grind through, and evolving them was a great way to incentivize playing through the otherwise boring and tedious game modes of the game. This all stopped once they essentially stopped creating them altogether. Adding to this, you could grind for hours and hours to get a card fully evolved, only for 2K to release a player that was far superior to yours the next day, only further removing the incentive to grind. 

**Badges-** I believe that *far* too much emphasis was placed on badges this year. You could have the best PG in the game statistically, but if he doesn't have HOF Range Extender and HOF Clamps then he would be nearly unplayable. I attribute this to the poor gameplay, almost like 2K acknowledged that their gameplay was bad and that the only way to counteract that was with badges. 

**Bad Rewards Players-** Remember that PD Shawn Kemp you got for finishing domination? Or the PD Serge Ibaka you got for winning 500 triple threat games? Me neither. 2K has done a decent job this year with updating **some** players stats/badges, but only the top tier GO reward cards. In a way, this only furthers the pay-to-win structure.

So, u/kylekorver17, how would *you* fix MyTeam if you could? Here are 8 ways that I think 2K could drastically improve MyTeam, in order of importance.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Better Servers/Less Latency-** Again, I have no idea how any of this stuff works from the development side, but the connection issues and input delay severely hinder the gameplay as a whole. I genuinely think MyTeam would be completely different if the online gameplay was smoother.
2. **Less Focus on the Stats/Badges, More Focus on the Players Themselves-** This is a really big one for me. In my opinion, the downfall of this game mode started when 2K began making the players unrealistic compared to their actual play style. Shaq/Ben Simmons with a 3pt shot, speedboosting centers, and bad defenders with clamps ruined the realism of the game mode for me. I feel that MyTeam was at its best when players' stats were applied realistically.
3. **Better Communication with the Community-** It's no secret that 2K has never really had the best communication in general. With the random player bans, lack of updates about the game mode (other than promotional trailers), and no (real) effective way to report a problem, communication is certainly not a strong suit for 2K. I think that a defined 'MyTeam guy' would really help the game be better. I'm aware of TBG, but I'm thinking of something along the lines of a Ronnie type guy, but just for MyTeam; preferably one who's actually involved with the community.
4. **Following Through With New Additions-** Evolution players, Spotlight Challenges, and Moments challenges. What do they all have in common? They're all great additions to the game that were all suddenly abandoned. I think MyTeam would benefit a lot from consistency, and keeping the game updated with their new additions. 
5. **Removing the 12-0 System-** Don't have too much to say about this, i just think 12-0 is a bit too difficult, and could be replaced by a 10 win system, where there is some leeway. Maybe allow for one or two losses.
6. **Spice up Domination-** Domination has been essentially copy-pasted every year since they added the all time teams. I don't really have any good ideas for how the game mode could be changed, but anything new would probably help. 
7. **Make Reward Cards Viable for a While-** Anyone who's played through the offline content in this game knows that the cards you get in October won't last you until December (with a few exceptions). Even if this means making the grind harder/take longer, it would be much more rewarding to know that you earned a serviceable player for the forseeable future.
8. **Less Emphasis on Badges-** Again, not much to say here other than it would be nice if badges weren't the primary indicator of a card's ability.

Unfortunately, knowing 2K, I'm assuming that none of these changes will actually occur, but I figured I would put this stuff out there on the community's behalf. 

These are just my opinions/ideas about the game, I'd love to hear others. Thanks for reading (if anyone actually read this whole thing)",2,1585270716,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fpnlc2/nba_2k20_myteam_how_2k_is_ruining_a_great_game/,NBA2k,1

fphslb,JazzManOS,Now would be a perfect time for 2k to fix the audio in streams,"As many of you may be aware, if you try and stream gameplay of 2k20, *all* audio except buzzers and whistles are blocked. With the influx of real NBA players playing and streaming 2k during the league shutdown, I feel that now is the perfect time for 2k to go to work and fix this. Obviously music is copyrighted and likely cannot be streamed; but what about the announcers, crowd, and just overall sound?

Being in an online MyLeague with 29 other users is awesome, but it's hard to watch a stream when there's literally no audio to keep you engaged; it's weird watching a game and not hearing *anything*. Even weirder when you watch some of these official NBA teams streaming would-be matchups against other teams, and someone playing has to have a microphone set up next to their TV just so you can hear the audio.

It was never like this in 2k14 and 2k15. The game allowed you to stream and capture gameplay with all audio present aside from the licensed music, which makes sense. But now, everything is blocked.

fpfscr,fivecents_milkmen,My Career Wish List. What's yours?,"Been playing mycareer ever since it started by i skipped some due to either repetitive storylines or bad reviews. I'm currently playing on my 3rd season in 2k19 and found out that 2k20 is currently on sale via Steam. With this, I did some research regarding this year's mycareer since its the only mode I play. I found out that it still has the same issues : Pre determined storylines that doesnt matter after your first season, Immortal builds,dumb AI's.  
Because of these, I hope 2k can come up with a whole new and improve mycareer next year.  
Here's my wish list:  
\-No more pre determined storylines.

\- Start from high school and have the options to go through the draft from highschool, grind through college,or play overseas.

\-Have realistic possible injuries.

\-Have realistic consequences or outcomes from your answers to post game interviews.

\-Signature shoes should not be limited to 1 season.

\-AI teammates should have realistic tendencies.

\-Help defense from AI teammates.

\-Be traded or sent to the G League due to performance or chemistry issues.

\-And lastly, start strong. You should be able to at least start decently by being able to build a decent starter player. You can't be a draft prospect with 50 OVR ALL. 

I know that this is impossible to happen within the next few years but who knows?

And, I still find myself turning those features on in 2k20. If you are new to 2k and you are reading this, do yourself a favor and turn those features on.
In weird pick-n-roll situations I find it incredibly helpful when the indicator ""SWITCH"" pops up above my involved teammate's head, as opposed to nothing popping up. Me then having to guess if the AI is going to switch, and having to rely on the tiny indicator at my feet pointing me in the general direction of my assignment. You have the capability, this would just be a no brainer in my mind. It would elevate the casual 2k/NBA fan's experience.
The AI in the game is too smart for the casual player to just hop on the sticks and hope to be successful without it. AI computers recognize when to switch but the casual fan may not resulting in frustration and not a good experience. Then there is the offensive end. This game has SO much more to offer in terms of scoring, scoring with ease mind you, all because a play was executed perfectly. You're doing your devs a disservice by literally not displaying their hard work.
A big thing that we harp on in the community is having ""basketball IQ"" - For those that didn't play organized basketball, turning those features would help so much. I personally believe we would see this type of stuff translate to my MyPark too. Knowing where to be, make what decision, and at what time - AND DO IT PERFECTLY!! Its a lot to take in. Little indicators here and there wouldn't hurt, at least in my opinion. Just my two cents.",3,1585229115,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fpbfya/play_art_and_team_communication/,NBA2k,1

fp2128,TexehCtpaxa,Paint Beast at 7'2 or 7'3,"Mostly playing just nba games.

My 7'3 interior force was awesome to play with on offense but defensively was a liability. 

I can't tell if 7'2 or 3 is better for the paint beast C (red/blue 22,1,7,25) 

Does the extra inch of height and wingspan make a difference long term? Does the 7'3 eventually jump for boards as well as 7'2 when they have same badges? 

At 75 OVR 7'3 is easier to score with but harder to rebound with because he can't jump. At 7'2 the +6 speed isn't noticeable, the vertical is better as well as getting position for rebounding. But I did get 1 shot blocked. Does 7'3 give some advantage that isn't clear outside the actual gameplay?

I dont see why not, but there feels a difference at the start. 7'3 wins offense, 7'2 wins rebounds.",3,1585183761,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fp2128/paint_beast_at_72_or_73/,NBA2k,1

fosnto,ffbfanatic,My 1st impressions of the game as a casual gamer,"So I‚Äôm not like a hardcore gaming person like many are here and I only got it because I have at least the next month or so of doing nothing so I got the switch recently and picked up this game, now it‚Äôs been about 5-7 years since I played 2k on PS3 so I‚Äôm sure my review will be really different but here are some of my first impressions and gripes about it (I finished the draft part of mycareer and am about 10 games into the season)

1. Shooting is IMPOSSIBLE!!! In previous games once you understand how to time shots you were able to at least have some success with it, this game after about 5 days of constant playing I am getting perfect release probably less than 1% of the time, and I‚Äôm playing with a shot making PG. Even better, I don‚Äôt think I have one time get a perfect release in an actual game!! Free throws I have managed to get that a few times, but on any other type of shots it is always too early or too late! Incredibly frustrating to the point I was ready to give up the other day

2. Playing defense is really difficult!! Don‚Äôt know if the player response to your controller is slow or what but literally every time the opposing PG tries to break me down they almost always do with a easy layup 

3. Graphics on the switch is a little glitchy but with less processing power that was expected and on hand held it is actually pretty solid 

4. I know some don‚Äôt care for this type of stuff but I always like watching storylines and little gadgets in the game and in this case they did a really nice job, and I like all the different additions like endorsements talking to agents etc etc 

Think my main thing is the gameplay and maybe this is not geared for someone like me that casually plays, maybe this game is for you hardcore guys? I assume most of you have no issues with shooting or D so maybe some of you can give me some pointers?  Even in practice mode I tried for an hour and can‚Äôt figure out the timing on shots? Maybe I just suck? Lol",12,1585151753,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fosnto/my_1st_impressions_of_the_game_as_a_casual_gamer/,NBA2k,1

James Harden will pull his dribble moves one on one and somehow can't get around his man and gets stuck in the mid range all the time. That NEVER happens in real life. Those things different?  What are some of the annoying thinks in 20 to compare?",2,1585101440,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/foi13r/biggest_difference_between_2k_19_and_20_with/,NBA2k,1

fo60om,Hammertime6689,What are your thoughts on Giant builds? - 7'3,"I have way to many builds ranging from Play-Shot PG to 2-way slashing SF to 7'3 Paint Defender. I enjoy all the builds for different reasons but the ones I go back to because it just seems easy are all of my 7'3, max wingspans

Here is a list of my 7'3 builds that I like and reasons I like them:

Paint Defender - Blue/Green - Can do it all offensively. 21 finishing, 21 shooting, 9 defense. Height and weight do wonders on defense for a non defensive pie. The one downfall is hes got 0 orange attributes. I still have to get my post fade shot down but this guy is a mismatch nightmare. One of my favorite builds I've had in an 2k. Hof Dropstepper, Backdown, Deep fades, and Catch and Shoot cant be guarded. 10/10

GLock - All red - Just made this one and clearly he dominates in the paint but I didnt realize his offense around the rim was also extremely good. Hes not gonna hit a jumpshot so hes a lane clogger but its worth it to have under the rim. Straight animal from 5-7 feet (sounds short but theres a lot of action there in Rec games) 8/10

Interior Force - Orange/Blue - Verdict is still out. So far 6/10

The downfall for all is speed and the problems compound when you have PGs who sprint up the court after a make and want to play 4 on 5. Totally understand why people favor speed in this game. But with Intimidator being what it is and making it extremely tough for big men to score on eachother, the 97"" wingspan is borderline cheat code with its release point. Plus they are standing dunk machines.

So, have you guys made any 7'3 that you like or didnt like and why? (besides speed)",28,1585060152,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fo60om/what_are_your_thoughts_on_giant_builds_73/,NBA2k,1

So I started a second MyCareer. I see a slot for a second MyCareer save file in the main MyCareer menu, so I clicked on that, and then created my build and then started my career as per normal. 
But when I got the chance to quit after some games, it didn't save this second MyCareer, the second MyCareer save slot remains empty. 

I've tried multiple times now, skipping the college part, not skipping it, still with the same result. Once I even played non stop all the way from the college games until I got to the NBA, and still when I quit after getting drafted, it didn't save.

fnzjh6,ShakirtheSenior,"It's Been Real, Knicks","Alright, let's talk about the Knicks.

Like many of you, I picked up 2K when it dropped to $20 on the Playstation store a week ago. I need my NBA fix so I've been playing something like 8 - 12 hours a DAY in MyCareer. Yes, I painstakingly threw up bricks for the grind. I missed shot after shot and had turnovers breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I was tossing bricks all without Quick Draw as I got mobbed on by every team. 

Eventually, I put up 4 points a game which turned into 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and even a 60pt demolition on the Clippers. 

But bruh, the ORDEAL it was playing on this trash Knick lineup has been torture. I can't tell you how many times I've put up 20 pt leads, thrown about 6 - 8 assist to make Randle and Murray feel good, just to come back 2 min later off the bench and see the other team taking a nap with a 15pt lead. 

This team is so much garbage, it made me question if I was legit supposed to be losing games. I went a whopping 18 - 64 and I'll be real, the AI for my teammates was unbelievable. I've literally seen Payton go coast to coast to miss a layup as my player chilled on the perimeter waiting to sink a 3. I've had Payton even lob the ball straight INTO the other team's hands after I tossed it out the trafficked paint for him to hit a wide open mid-range. Randle be throwing up Curry-level 3's as three guys give him a full body massage. RJ barely played and when he did, he couldn't move into a better position for a shot if his life depended on it. Night after night the entire defense gave an open walking tour of the basket for whichever Star Player wanted to see it. 

The one saving grace, my man Mitch Robinson. This angel put in everything I tossed him, saved my trash shots with put-backs, and single-handedly controlled the paint. Mitch, you the real MVP in 2K and life. 

So anyways, I simmed the last 10 games cause I couldn't handle it anymore. I'll be real, it's been dope NY but I need rings, awards, playoff appearances and some MVP shots.

I took my happy ass to the Lakers and that's that.

fnxf90,gamesrgreat,Questions About the Effect of some Badges,"Lightning Reflexes- I've seen people say you move faster or react faster in general but then others say it's just about the arrow prompt. What is the truth?  

Off Ball Pest- does this badge make you more fluid and quicker off ball on D or just make bumping people with L or L+R more effective?

Moving Truck- Does this actually do anything? I've tried it on Gold and tried it without the badge and I cant rlly tell the difference.  My guy is undersized with 99 Str so I thought maybe this could help me against Paint Beasts.   

Pogo Stick- Does this badge affect how quickly you can jump after a block attempt if you are then going for a rebound?

Post Move Lockdown- I see people say this stops people from moving you around...but is that accurate? Or does it just make their post move less effective? Is there a way to counter post moves with the controls or am i supposed to just stay in front of them?",6,1585017774,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fnxf90/questions_about_the_effect_of_some_badges/,NBA2k,1

fnmevf,regnadrebu,Which version of the Playmaking Glass-Cleaner do you prefer?,"For those who don't know, the 6'8 PF Yellow/Red pie chart at 99 overall has:

* Contact dunks
* over 70 3pt shot
* Speed-boosts with takeover (playmaking)
* Rebounds very well
* Can guard 1-5 (fast enough for the guards, big enough to guard the centers)

Here is the Original Play-glass build. Now there is only one thing that is holding me back with this...

The finishing. The badge layout is 1/10/17/20. This means that even though you can get contact dunk animations, you only can get contact finishing on bronze. And well, the layups aren't super highly rated. 

https://preview.redd.it/ikmz68oc0go41.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a12ff55c111a023e5e71ff907540ac63644aec01

So here is a version of the build that I tweaked, just so to get 3 finishing badges for gold contact finisher. The downside is that I am losing a lot of other badges though. Badge layout for this version is 3/10/12/19

So does it change ur archetype depending on how u play? And can I change it by doing more playmaking?

fnf56a,mkzphreakk,This game has become far worse than 2k18 and it‚Äôs not even close,"Everyone hated 18 because of the blowbys. But they weren‚Äôt nearly as bad as 20 blowbys. In 18 you could easily make contact, you‚Äôd just get dragged with the ballhandler and posterized if you didn‚Äôt attempt to block the shot.


This year they slide right past you. HOF clamps cannot stay in front of a slashing playmaker. Even if you do get lucky enough to make contact‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt matter. And I say lucky enough because you are so ungodly slow on defense compared to the ball handler. Again, I don‚Äôt care what your build is or what badges you have, you move like a statue from left to right on defense.


Aside from the blowbys being worse, we have a neighborhood that encompasses so much, you‚Äôre lucky to see 20 people actually playing at once.

In 18 we could make our own shirts and get them free. Now we have to buy all the tops, some upwards of 25-35k VC. But thank god we got our free haircuts, right?


The game is nothing but an interceptor fest at higher levels (seriously it‚Äôs ridiculous watching players sit in passing lanes smashing square when the ball hasn‚Äôt even been passed yet) stamina on offense is more than triple defense if you have handles for days and the physics, especially in terms of butt and leg steals are straight laughable.


I do not understand why we can‚Äôt get a patch for some of this. Or at least someone from 2k to actually engage the community. Mike Wang has gone silent since patch 9, and in my opinion 10 was the worst thing to happen to the game this year as that seemed to be a huge buffing point for said blowbys.


The 2k team should be ashamed for how much money they make vs how transparent they are about their goals and progress around the game. Everyone gives Ronnie shit but if it weren‚Äôt for him and his team capitalizing on social media and celebrities this game wouldn‚Äôt have a following at all. It‚Äôs that bad of a game considering it‚Äôs 2020. 


Live has a huge opportunity to overtake the market and they realize it which is why they‚Äôre all hands in for next gen. I 100% promise you that if 2k continues this shit for another year they will be overtaken.",26,1584944028,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fnf56a/this_game_has_become_far_worse_than_2k18_and_its/,NBA2k,1

fn8z46,Neusch22,This 2K is one of the more broken games I've played in a while,"Downloaded this game due to game pass having it for free. Was suprised to see that online is a terrible experience half the time due to disconnects, input lag that feels like you're a second or two behind every movement and shot you try to take. Created a pro-am team and can't even invite friends as the invites never show for them. 

An actual skilled based matchmaking would be good so that 60 ovr players don't get stuck in lobbies full of badged up 90+ players, but I know that feature is just to promote players to buy VC.. 

That being said it's kind of ridiculous that there's crazy input lag in all online modes for the most popular basketball game on the market..

* Run a guard-oriented spread offense
* Use a defense that traps, goes for steals a lot, etc.

Currently have 2 finishing badges on silver outback.
2 shooting on bronze C&amp;S and QuickDraw

fn4pat,PurpleFoldingChair_,Need Advice For A Build,"Need Help in tweaking my build

So I only run threes with my friends and usually run the big man or middle man. I have chosen to go the red/yellow pie chart at the pf and I was wondering if this will be good enough to meet my goals.

Two Way Playmaker PF: 6‚Äô9 weight is a few notches from max and im unsure what wingspan to go. Badges: 5/10/10/19

Attributes:

Close Shot: 84
Driving Layup: 73
Driving Dunk 78
Standing Dunk: 28 
Post Hook: 30

Mid-Range: 66-71 (wingspan)
Three Point: 60-65 (wingspan)
Post Fade: 72

Pass Accuracy: 83
Ball Handle: 63-67 (wingspan)
Post Moves (46)

Interior D: 82
Perimeter D: 62
Lateral Quickness: 67
Steal: 43-45 (wingspan)
Block: 80-88 (wingpan)
Offenisve Rebound: 82
Defensive Rebound: 89

Overall Im just a role player. My playstyle is to just set solid screens, position for rebounds, try to lock my guy up as much as possible and Im usually the secondary playmaker hence why I wanted the playmaking chart for hof dimer and floor general. only score when wide open as im the last option

So my goals/worries are:

1. Shooting:
Based off my friends playstyle I get the least touches and I‚Äôm hoping that the 60 3 ball would be enough to go at least 50% from corner threes. Im not wanting to shoot anywhere else and only from the corner and Im also unsure about which badges to selecf. I would go min wingspan for the 65 three but im not sure if its worth giving up the defense. And on the defensive note

2. Defense:
I say most of the time I have to play 55% big men 20% small forwards and 25% really fast shooters at the point guard. Im just worried if my 60ish lateral and perimter d is enough to stop the guards but im more worried about the big men. Will i be able to compete for rebounds against the 6-10/11/7‚Äô0 because I know i cant outrebound the 7‚Äô3 glocks. I think my strength is an 81. Also I‚Äôm not sure about the wingspan so is 80 block enough to contest layups or should i go with the 88 block and lose out on the 65 3pt and have the 60 3pt 

3. Finishing: 
Im not as worried because I dont drive as much but what badges should I go (I get 5)

4. Pie Chart/Wingspan
I straight up dont know what pie chart to use for my guy and im just worried if 60 3pt is enough for corners because i really want that 88 block but idk if its worth it to sacrifice it.

TLDR: So overall Im just unsure about how well my build is gonna be and how long my wingspan is gonna be

Ty in advance I really wanna pursue this pie chaty but I don really wanna go any shorter than 6‚Äô9 or taller than 6‚Äô10",10,1584902610,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fn4pat/need_advice_for_a_build/,NBA2k,1

After all the reward screens - giving me the reward from winning the match, the vault, and then the daily challenge, I went back to Triple Threat and all of a sudden I had an empty slot where Brandon Roy had been. I then looked at my lineup and he was nowhere to be found anymore.

I then went into the Collection screen and checked, and he was also missing from there.

He appears to have completely disappeared from my collection. The other thing on that screen which used to say I needed 6 more cards to get the next reward now says that I need 7. So it's like I lost the card completely. (How??)

fmx0pa,PurpleFoldingChair_,Need Help in tweaking my build,"So I only run threes with my friends and usually run the big man or middle man. I have chosen to go the red/yellow pie chart at the pf and I was wondering if this will be good enough to meet my goals.

Two Way Playmaker PF: 6‚Äô9 weight is a few notches from max and im unsure what wingspan to go. Badges: 5/10/10/19

Attributes:

Close Shot: 84
Driving Layup: 73
Driving Dunk 78
Standing Dunk: 28 
Post Hook: 30

Mid-Range: 66-71 (wingspan)
Three Point: 60-65 (wingspan)
Post Fade: 72

Pass Accuracy: 83
Ball Handle: 63-67 (wingspan)
Post Moves (46)

Interior D: 82
Perimeter D: 62
Lateral Quickness: 67
Steal: 43-45 (wingspan)
Block: 80-88 (wingpan)
Offenisve Rebound: 82
Defensive Rebound: 89

Overall Im just a role player. My playstyle is to just set solid screens, position for rebounds, try to lock my guy up as much as possible and Im usually the secondary playmaker hence why I wanted the playmaking chart for hof dimer and floor general. only score when wide open as im the last option

So my goals/worries are:

1. Shooting:
Based off my friends playstyle I get the least touches and I‚Äôm hoping that the 60 3 ball would be enough to go at least 50% from corner threes. Im not wanting to shoot anywhere else and only from the corner and Im also unsure about which badges to selecf. I would go min wingspan for the 65 three but im not sure if its worth giving up the defense. And on the defensive note

2. Defense:
I say most of the time I have to play 55% big men 20% small forwards and 25% really fast shooters at the point guard. Im just worried if my 60ish lateral and perimter d is enough to stop the guards but im more worried about the big men. Will i be able to compete for rebounds against the 6-10/11/7‚Äô0 because I know i cant outrebound the 7‚Äô3 glocks. I think my strength is an 81. Also I‚Äôm not sure about the wingspan so is 80 block enough to contest layups or should i go with the 88 block and lose out on the 65 3pt and have the 60 3pt 

3. Finishing: 
Im not as worried because I dont drive as much but what badges should I go (I get 5)

4. Pie Chart/Wingspan
I straight up dont know what pie chart to use for my guy and im just worried if 60 3pt is enough for corners because i really want that 88 block but idk if its worth it to sacrifice it.

TLDR: So overall Im just unsure about how well my build is gonna be and how long my wingspan is gonna be

Ty in advance I really wanna pursue this pie chaty but I don really wanna go any shorter than 6‚Äô9 or taller than 6‚Äô10",7,1584867940,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fmx0pa/need_help_in_tweaking_my_build/,NBA2k,1

fmwi1w,CoachZenBarba,Five Q/A with Legendary Coach Zen Barbatrucco,"**Zen, how do you feel in Minneapolis after 42 2Kseasons with the Lakers?**

It's a little colder ... but I like cold, i like snow, frozen rivers and things like that. When I'll retire from basketball I will almost certainly go to live in a Lappish village of maximum 100 inhabitants.

**You are at the helm of the T'Wolves since only 8 games with a record of 3-5, but there is clearly a before Kawhi (0-2) and an after Kawhi (3-3). How has the team changed with the arrival of The Claw?**

Awareness has changed. When I arrived the first weeks I saw a get-it-right-atmosphere but nothing more. When I took Kawhi for Rubio, KAT and the first draft pick of 2016 and 2017, to the managment it was a shock: they understood that now it's getting very serious.

**You missed a lot of games in the last seconds: the incredibile Rose's bomb against Chicago at the buzzer, or the fouls not whistled on Leonard's decisive lay-ups against the Sacramento Kings, or the missed winning three-point shot at the buzzer by Kawhi in his debut game with the T'Wolves against the Detroit Pistons . At this time you could have been 5-3 and therefore widely in the playoffs...**

If 'ifs' and 'buts' were candy and nuts, we'd all have a Merry Christmas

**LaVine is definitely the surprise of the team so far**

There is no doubt. Zach is amazing me and I think his teammates are amazing too. Zach is not only taking decisive shots, scoring almost all of them, but he has shown a maturity hitherto hidden from me too. He didn't have a very good reputation but, instead, I have always believed in Zach and its potential, I just didn't think it showed up so early. And he's only 20 years old.

**The Minnesota T'Wolves Nba champions. When?**

The Western Conference is very tough. It will still take several years to build a team capable of beating the greats of the West",0,1584864765,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fmwi1w/five_qa_with_legendary_coach_zen_barbatrucco/,NBA2k,1

fmsv5o,YaboyRipTide,Tips against HOF GOATed Lakers in Suns Spotlight,"The suns are BLESSED to play a fully jacked up lakers squad for their Hall of Fame game. The Lakers have a FULL PD starting lineup including GOAT AD and Opal Dwight. Basically all diamonds off the bench except for Danny green who I believe is a ruby. Literally this team is unstoppable especially on Hall of Fame. does anyone have any tips? I‚Äôm using the best suns players outside Marion and Amar‚Äôe but I‚Äôve never felt so worthless. 

Nash can‚Äôt contain PD Bradley (why tf does he even have a PD??????), Diamond Oubre and PD Chambers just get exposed by AD and LeBron. The only one who seems to not be terrible is Diamond Ayton vs Dwight just because Ayton is a monster on the glass. I‚Äôve played the game maybe 5 times now and it‚Äôs always close until the 4th when some bs happens and AD or LeBron or fucking Avery Bradley goes off for 10 unanswered and I fall behind and lose.

But I've played plenty of madden, and religiously play NHL (trash game).

Anyways, I'm doing my player and loving it so far. Loving the grind and story mode. Currently in my first NBA season and a backup PG for the sixers. I think the most points I've had in a game, was 11. I built my guy to be a grinder/slasher like how AI was. I drive the lane alot and get those physical layups ect.

Only problem I have, is sometimes when I pass the ball, it'll pass to someone way over THERE. Instead of dumping it off for the easy layup. Is this a stay I need to raise? (passing is currently a 79)

Also is there a way to increase my mid range pull ups, that are currently maxed at 75? Don't get me wrong, love being the little guy, getting 10 assist and slashing through. But we all know there's a time and need for that mid range jumper that needs to go down.

Anyways, sorry for being the noob at the park, jealous of how much 2k has given this game, when NHL can't do shit lol.

FOR PEOPLE NEW TO 2K: don‚Äôt think too highly of yourselves. People fall guilty to the idea that they have a good enough stick to ‚Äúget by‚Äù with 1 defensive badge. That person is not you. Or anybody else for that matter.

You green everything on one end then you give it right back on the other end. ADD MORE DEFENSE TO YOUR BUILDS. 

everybody wants to be a scorer. But nobody wants to clamp up....  

But when all of you 1 defensive badge people get blown by and abused on defense, your teammates (people like me) have to rotate over to help you. WE GET IT PROGRAMMED IN OUR MINDS THAT YOURE GOING TO NEED HELP. And that becomes a hole in our defense from the very beginning. Which means we‚Äôre leaving somebody open too. And any good teammate will throw the ball to the guy we‚Äôre leaving open...when we try and help your sorry ass. 

So don‚Äôt yell when the guy we‚Äôre ‚Äúassigned‚Äù to guard has a ridiculous amount of points at the end of the game. We‚Äôre too busy trying to bail your bronze clamps having ass out...

GOOD defense will create offense for you. You don‚Äôt need a 95+ 3 ball to be effective. Or a 97 driving dunk. Put some of that into defense.

fmaxhs,Myrical_lyfe,New guy here.,"So I downloaded this game, because it was free, and we'll, I'm locked in the house like most lol.

But I've played plenty of madden, and religiously play NHL (trash game).

Anyways, I'm doing my player and loving it so far. Loving the grind and story mode. Currently in my first NBA season and a backup PG for the sixers. I think the most points I've had in a game, was 11. I built my guy to be a grinder/slasher like how AI was. I drive the lane alot and get those physical layups ect.

Only problem I have, is sometimes when I pass the ball, it'll pass to someone way over THERE. Instead of dumping it off for the easy layup. Is this a stay I need to raise? (passing is currently a 79)

Also is there a way to increase my mid range pull ups, that are currently maxed at 75? Don't get me wrong, love being the little guy, getting 10 assist and slashing through. But we all know there's a time and need for that mid range jumper that needs to go down.

Anyways, sorry for being the noob at the park, jealous of how much 2k has given this game, when NHL can't do shit lol.

Thanks guys!",7,1584773311,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fmaxhs/new_guy_here/,NBA2k,1

fmalvf,XT3M3,BootCamp is a great Idea that is poorly done. and how to fix it for 2k21,"bootcamp is the event many Casuals and  new people been asking for , for years.   and while it is for people 75 overall or lower, the mode in general is still ruined by  cheesers and what not. 

- IMHO the mode should just be a random  ""surprise"",pop up mode.   2k announces these things like 1-2 weeks in advance and that gives  tryhards and  sweats  the    chance to ""grind"" their  75 overall player to the heights of  MJ.   dont forget, your stats arent  whats carrying your in NBA 2k, it your  badges and you manipulation of the game and exploits.  give XxXIZOSXxX  1-2 weeks to grind a 75 overall build to have the same ammount of  badges as his 95 overall build  and he keeps his main stats and ignores the stuff he wont use anyway,   you are   much getting the same player.

-   The games should be for rep based people rather than overall based people.   people grinding to  legend and  trying to get up there  most likely wont waste their time trying to get into an event that doesnt  benefit them. (minus streamers and youtubers)

i feel like these 2 things would  make it do what i hope 2k  had originally envisioned for this  mode",4,1584771464,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fmalvf/bootcamp_is_a_great_idea_that_is_poorly_done_and/,NBA2k,1

In 20 i feel that a lot of times im stuck in an animation and that i can't do nothing about, but in 18 the players moved much smoother and much more natural. Shooting is faster and more realistic too.

I recommend you try it out, it's remarkable what you can notice now with the benefit of having played 19 and 20.

fm60oi,PistolClutch7,3 Good and Bad Things about MyCareer 2k20,"(Nothing much on Park, I dont play park)

1 - Good

Setting your own Caps for each thing. It's awesome that you can do this, so you can have virtually any build you want, making it more realistic to the game of basketball)

1 - Bad

The Caps you set can only go so high. You don't get complete customization for caps. It makes some sense, because people will have 99 threes and dunks, and have 25 for useless shit. But still annoying.

2 - Good

Game difficulty for NBA games are pretty easy - after you get to a 70 overall. This makes it easy to rack up VC once you're good. It adds fun to the game, getting to do superstar stuff.

2 - Bad

You can't play on rookie. Playing on rookie helped me during 2k17. Plus it was more fun to play, doing crazy stuff and breaking records. And if they allowed playing on rookie, they could do what MyTeam does where you only get 75% of the VC you earn, making you have to play more.

3 - Good

VC is relatively easy to make. If you do the prelude, you can get high VC payments per game, which is like real life, getting different contracts. Plus, once you get good, you get different endorsements. And after being with them, you can get around 7,000 VC per event, I currently have that for my Beats deal.

3 - Bad

Unreal expectations in games. I tried to make my player like my real self, 6'2"", a Guard. And when on defense playing against the Sixers for one moment I'm guarding Raul Neto, then they want me to guard Joel Embiid. And when he posterized me, I lose all takeover points in the bar, and my teammate grade drops a letter grade.

Overall I'm enjoying MyCareer this year, because last year I didnt do it due to 2k18's Shitshow. But I'm back to enjoying it.",2,1584750451,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fm60oi/3_good_and_bad_things_about_mycareer_2k20/,NBA2k,1

And me having a 6‚Äô10 paint beast gets forced into the 4 spot when I hate playing there and get shot out the game due to no scorers. First of 2k needs to move to default 4 out 1 in like most teams in real life already play. And secondly allow you to set what position your character can play for pro am.

Dudes make them pgs and don‚Äôt even want to run their own position. They just sit in the corner  while someone else find the offense. Which sucks because they‚Äôre supposed be the the cream of the crop when it comes to playmaking. It‚Äôs even worse in rec because it‚Äôs barely type of floor spacing running with dudes with builds like like these. Unless someone has floor general and dimer for their bum asses. But no they want someone else to do all the work while they just wait. And don‚Äôt let their matchup be another 2 Way player because it‚Äôs CLAMPS easy. 

It‚Äôs been even more of them lately because it‚Äôs just bums making them because  they think they‚Äôll play better but in actuality they don‚Äôt know how to use them. 

I just close app every time I see one on my team.

Guess I'm posting to help anyone like me still tryna find a Tobias Harris/Melo-esque build. Obviously the 3 ball ain't rated too high, but badges will let you hit over 50% anyway.

Such as; only association and mycareer are available other than story mode and black top, there are no HOF badges in the mycareer and there are far less choices for mycareer (you can't even pick your own weight, wingspan or college graduated from) and a whole slew of other things.

flo8ya,RiiiskUKK,Badge Trouble,"Been watching loads of YouTube Videos on the best ways to get shooting and playmaking badges. 

Now, I‚Äôm new this game only getting it 2 weeks ago, and finishing for my PF, as alley oops are great. But on my PG, setting up alley oops playing for the Lakers is genuinely infuriating and makes me want to quit the game.

In terms of shooting, I put up at 85 point game with most of them being 3s and mid range shots, however because I can barely ever get open as I get double teamed and the player guarding me runs round teammate screens easily, I missed an incredible amount of shots, resulting me in only getting 10k for the shooting badge. 

To cut a long story short, does anybody have a great way to get playmaking or shooting badges, as genuinely I want to uninstall the game at this point, thanks for any help.",7,1584676434,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/flo8ya/badge_trouble/,NBA2k,1

fln5qs,HoodieMelo24,Two Changes that would make 2k SO much better,"1. **Scouting report in park/rec/pro-am**

\-They have this in MyCareer but no one uses it because it's MyCareer. Even just showing the last 25 game shot chart would be so helpful on defense. I'm no programmer but I feel like this is something they could easily add in an update or on the game next year.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Call for Pass button**

\-When you press ""a"" or ""x"" (On playstation) off the ball, your icon should appear over your head. If you call for the ball and there is a defender close to you, your teammate grade takes a massive hit. If you call for the ball while open and you don't get the ball, the person who didn't pass you the ball will take a teammate grade hit if they miss a shot that is contested, get a turnover, or hold onto the ball for more than 4 seconds after the initial call (Minimum 3 times to activate the hit). The exact balancing isn't important but this would make everyone happier when they are playing with a bad point guard.

&amp;#x200B;

These two changes are simple, realistic, and something everyone can get behind.",7,1584671856,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/fln5qs/two_changes_that_would_make_2k_so_much_better/,NBA2k,1

2. Cut off the baseline. Baseline dunks can kill, so almost step out of bounds so that can‚Äôt be an option

Other notes:

* Up to HOF, the CPU was still susceptible to pattern looping to the basket for an uncontested layup and to the Quick Thru STS play

***This may go without saying since everyone  already probably knows this, but the MT is always capped at 1,200 a  game, so the 2x multiplier for HOF is not gonna net you anything extra.  You will absolutely exceed 1,200 MT once you win, but you don't get the  excess.***",49,1584646429,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/flg5q3/requirements_for_each_spotlight_challenge/,NBA2k,2

We've seen common tips like play on HOF, but when you can't do anything early on like hit a 3 or even a midrange jumper...how are you accumulating point? How are you getting to the starting line up, how are you becoming a star, getting shoes, getting outfits.

flcowl,blackpanther21229,How shooting works in this game,"I‚Äôm a playmaking shot creator. This isn‚Äôt a rant, I‚Äôm just trying to string together how shooting really works in this game. For starters, I‚Äôm at a 97 rating which puts my 3pt shot at a 90. In almost all of my games I miss my first 2 3 pt shots. The only time I make my first 3pt is if I have hot start equipped, or if my team is losing. 

I‚Äôm also noticing a lot of equalizing going on around the field goal %. If you feel like a lot of bs is happening in 1 game, check the fog attempts. They‚Äôll usually make you miss if your opponent is missing, especially if they are a lower rep.

The one thing I can say I despise is when they make you miss wide open full releases when you have 20+ shooting badges in addition to a 90+ 3pt rating, it makes you as a player look bad. Makes teammates less likely to pass you the ball. It‚Äôs games I start off 0-2 and finish 7-9. I think 2k has a hard time balancing real life, and virtual reality with shooting inconsistencies such as this one. Nothing can guarantee your shot will go in. No badge, no rating, not even a boost. I understand no one makes every shot, but in my opinion, if you play smart enough you should be able to.",10,1584634629,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/flcowl/how_shooting_works_in_this_game/,NBA2k,1

fl39r2,JosephStall,TTO is probably the most rigged bs I‚Äôve ever seen in a sports sim video game,Every single time I clear a reward board and get my 5 ball drop I get absolutely hosed when the board resets. GO KD missing wide open 3s that were green releases just one game ago. Giannis getting blocked at the rim by SGs. The other team having Amethysts go 5/5 from 3. My AI defenders start playing like idiots. If you‚Äôre supposed to win a game you‚Äôre not losing unless you try to lose. I‚Äôve played plenty enough TTO games to know that there‚Äôs something other than player skill going on and it‚Äôs not just momentum. It works for me too so I can‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs only me getting hosed because there‚Äôs times where dudes are missing everything with GOs. Just let the better player win. Reward good play and punish bad play.

However, this isn't working for me because he NEVER goes to the post! He just goes out to one of the corners and hangs out there, which is completely useless. Is there any way I can tell him to always go stand in the paint and wait for rebounds? I feel like some of the other big men I've used (not very good players) will at least go stand under the basket, but Olajuwon insists on hiding in that corner for some reason.

I did find out that I can call for a ""Post Up"" play, but it's very annoying to have to do that every single possession, isn't there some setting to select to make that his default position in this mode?
