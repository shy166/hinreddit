fsofye,Big_smoke01,Why are video game publishers the only companies on earth who are willing to throw money away for no good reason i.e. refusing to make HL3 or remaster MW2’s multiplayer?,"Am I missing something? Valve would’ve make an obscene amount of money from just a single frame of an advertisement including the borealis. Same goes for Activision and MW2’s multiplayer. I don’t understand why it isn’t in their best interest to give in to the hype and let people open up their wallets? Other examples include: GTA6, Silent Hills, Portal 3, even a Minecraft sequel would sell ridiculously well.",58,1585699131,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsofye/why_are_video_game_publishers_the_only_companies/,gaming,0

fsodiq,faze_jesus123,I’m going to say it....... gta 5 sucks,"Honestly gta 5 is terrible, the comedy isn’t funny, they kill off some of the best characters from previous gta games and Trevor, Michael and Franklin are all terrible protagonist with stupid characters. They all only have one trait about them which means there’s no character development, Trevor’s crazy, Michael is a stuck up prick and franklin is just the token black gangster. 
The fact that this game gets any praise at all shocks me, it sucks that gta 5 killed all the other gta games because nobody wants to play them anymore even though they are x1000 better",35,1585698889,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsodiq/im_going_to_say_it_gta_5_sucks/,gaming,0

fsnn15,TheSparklyFox,A story of an ex-pirate.,"Hey, I don't usually write about myself on Reddit but I feel like I would really like to write about piracy and if it's right or not.

I live in a third world country where credit cards are non-existent and I naturally pirated my games, no one here even almost thinks about buying games. So when I grew up, I understood that piracy is theft so I had to change my ways.  My experience after that was basically buying gift cards for myself and redeeming it to my steam account which was difficult in a third world country with unofficial sites I had to use.  (cause they allow cash on delivery) Almost a year ago, I bought a PS4 (I know I am late) which forced me to buy my games and I honestly couldn't be happier. I now proudly buy all my games. The End.

&amp;#x200B;

 Tl;dr: Piracy is wrong even if it's just for AAA games or for games that you can't afford either way.",13,1585696278,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsnn15/a_story_of_an_expirate/,gaming,5

fsmzpq,andro-bourne,Sadly disappointment with Bannerlord. What about you?,"Well tons to say just not sure its even worth breaking down. Bugs and Save corruptions aside. (which is understandable for a new release) I'm just overall disappointment with what we got after waiting 8 years for the release... to me the game just feels like a reskin of warband... combat and map feels almost very similar (a little more smooth and obviously better graphics) and they added some EOL changes but over all... I'm not impressed with what we received after waiting for so long.

I mean where are the new features? It seems if anything they took away features. We can't even make camps anymore, and that was the first thing you learned about in the training camp on warband... and why not add things like making your own camp and slowly building it up to convert it into a town and then a Fief and later upgrade to a castle etc... I mean there is tons of features/ideas they could have added to the same. Other then blacksmithing\\forging, and the inventory system. like what is actually NEW?

Somethings overall just dont even feel planned out by the devs. Like doing caravans quests... you move faster then the caravan in the open world and every time you stop it pauses the game so I'm just spam clicking randomly on the map until the caravan gets to its location... Another issue is with companions... ones I'm finding cost 1.5k and you cant even see what states they have prior to recruiting them?????? Like wtf, I've unlocked 3 of them and they all have the same stats. Did any thinking process go into these things???

Anyways still a decent game if you are ok with basically a reskin of warband with better graphics and a little smoother combat.

I dont know. What do you all think?

P.S.And for those that are going to cry about it being early access. We all know, keep it in your pants. The point I'm making is we waited 8 years for this and out of all that waiting they can't even have some basic new features added to the game on release? Shit we already have graphic mods for warband... we didn't need to wait 8 years for that.

fsmvzm,Po5eidon1000,I've been playing through Horizon Zero Dawn again and I forgot how much I hated one of it's villains (In a good way) - Spoilers ahead,"Ted Faro in Horizon Zero Dawn in the one vilain in video games that I truly hate on a personal level. Not because he created the robots that wiped out humanity, but because of his shortsightedness and  selfishness that led him to deleting 'Apollo', the program that was supposed to teach the primal humans of the post post apocalyptic world all about humanity before they came along, so that they could work on fixing the planet

&amp;#x200B;

However, he didn't delete Apollo becuause he wanted Humanity to die or just because he felt like it. If that was the case then I actually wouldn't dislike his character as much as I do. It's because he deleted it purely just so he wouldn't be remebered as the guy who destroyed the earth. He knew it would probably end humanity, but his ego made him think it was justified.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard to describe exactly why I feel about his character in this way, but I think it boils down to this: He is a villain who doesn't see himself as the villain, but he goes further than that. He feels as if he is owed everything by the world, and if making sure he is remembered in a good way means that humanity is doomed, so be it. I know that isn't a very good description of why I feel this way about his character, but if you have played/watched someone play the game you probably know what I mean. I hope games in the future have more villains like Ted Faro, as personnally it makes me more invested in the game as I want the villain to be defeated for reasons outside of just becuase the game tells you that you must. And while Ted isn't a type of villain who can be defeated (as he is long gone by the time the game is set), he still is my favourite, most hated villain in any video game.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys know any other games with villains like this? If so, why do you hate them as well? I'm interested in what games people hate the villain personally instead of because the game tells them to hate them.",2,1585693749,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsmvzm/ive_been_playing_through_horizon_zero_dawn_again/,gaming,6

fsmaj6,Andrew_1313,Is Battlefield 4 still worth getting into in 2020?,"In 2005 I started playing Battlefield with BF2. Battlefield 1942 &amp; Battlefield 2 were the shit back in the day. Vietnam was also really fun. I kinda stopped with Battlefield after 2142 which I just didn't like that much. Because it was a console exclusive not on PC I didn't play Bad Company I had an Xbox 360 at the time but I saw no reason to play Bad Company. In 2009 Battlefield Bad Company 2 was announced. I was planning on building a new PC since I'd been rocking the same parts since 2006. In 2010 when the game launched I passed on it. All my friends were playing it and I did play it with them at their houses, they didn't play PC so I had a go at the Xbox 360 version which they all had.

I loved Bad Company 2 I went down to GAME UK and picked up a copy of it about 2 months after it released for the PC of course. Bad Company 2 never got boring for me. I did of course go back to play Battlefield 2 the odd time. Battlefield 3 was one of the most hyped games of all time and its release was one of the defining moments of the 2010s. Getting this game was a top priority for me and on  October 31st (Halloween) 2011 my brother and I went to GAME and picked up the limited edition physical warfare pack version of Battlefield 3 for the PC. From 2011 - 2013 Battlefield 3 was my go to game. I did have to purchase a premium membership to get most of the DLC's.

So in 2013 the Xbox One &amp; PlayStation 4 came out and instead of porting Battlefield 3 to the consoles  they released Battlefield 4 way too early from what I've heard about the game. When BF4 came out the game was heavily criticized and was broken so I skipped the game completely. I was getting bored with Battlefield again and I skipped Hardline as it did not interest me in the slightest. I was tempted to get Battlefield 1 but I never got around to it and the overwhelming hate for Battlefield V stopped me from buying it. I did eventually give BFV a try and I hated it. So is Battlefield 4 still active on PC? Is it worth getting into? Are the DLC maps just as active as the base game?",10,1585691873,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsmaj6/is_battlefield_4_still_worth_getting_into_in_2020/,gaming,3

Hello hope everyone is doing great considering the current global events. I consider myself a noob when it comes to pc building and all the technical stuff. I built a pc back in 2015 and September 2019 I bought Gears 5 to play through the campaign split screen with my wife. We played Gears 4 back in 2016 fyi. 

The thing is that whenever we tried to play the pc would completely shutdown 10-20 minutes into the session. This happened every single time so we gave up partially because we were busy at the time but now we want to try to play it but same thing keeps happening. The thing is that it happened while I was playing Apex(poorly) after like a 6 hour session and like a few weeks ago while playing AC Oddisey after like 5 hours but to the PCs defense the settings where very high.

It's overrated only because you can be bought back in the game unlimited number of times so low skilled player base is attracted to it. Blackout is pretty much the same. Firestorm possibly the worst br ever made, fortnite building stuff and tpp is just annoying. How come some AAA game studio does not make a game like pubg? Low ttk ,realistic, ballistics is great when you master it and you actually have to use your aim to win games.

fskxlx,LemmiwinksHUN,Which one to buy: Nioh 2 or Sekiro?,"Dark Souls fan here!

I've played all three DS games several times and I need somethimg refreshing.

I'm hesitating between these two titles.

I like Sekiro becase it's from the creators of the DS series. The grappling hook looks fun. In the other hand, I miss the character creation and it looks less replayable.

I like Nioh 2 because they say it's a huge game. The character creator looks deep and fun. It seems a lot more replayable. However, the graphics kinda confusing, everything is so flashy and chaotic.

The other considerable part is that my PC gets older and older as time goes. My specs:

- Gtx 750 Ti
- Intel Pentium G3420
- 10 GB RAM

It kept Dark Souls at 50-55 fps on 1080p very low settings. I'm looking for something similar if it's even possible.

I'm not a hardcore gamer. I mostly play WoW, and would like to do so on a higher graphics setting, with better performance. I've been using a 2014 Mac, and sometimes the game becomes unplayable because of sudden FPS drops, or very slow load times (especially during raids). I don't play many other games, but I might if I had a better computer.

[https://www.soldat.pl/en/](https://www.soldat.pl/en/) (you don't need Steam to play it, you can also get it from the game's website)

I suppose I'll give a quick summary.

Soldat was released in 2002, it has always been a free online multiplayer game and you don't need an account to play it, and the gameplay will remind you of Worms because Soldat was heavily influenced by another ""Worms-like"" game called Liero.   
There are several servers with different game modes (hide and seek, capture the flag, deathmatch, team deathmatch, trench wars, friendly-fire trench wars, climbing and so on).  
You can also vote-kick players and vote for different maps.

You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldat_(video_game)), or you can download it and try it out. It's less than 300 MB only!",0,1585687344,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fskvh5/an_old_classic_has_been_rereleased_on_steam_for/,gaming,4

fsjgmj,A_Normal_Pyromaniac,Sasha," So I got bored and decided to do measurement on Heavy's (Mikhail) mini-gun or as he named it Sasha revealed in Poker Night at the Inventory. In Meet the Heavy he says Sasha weighs about 150 Kilograms That is roughly 330.75 pounds which is extremely heavy for a chain gun which of that caliber usually weigh about 85 pounds and in the same video he claims it takes 400,000 dollars for twelve seconds but the chain gun fires 4 rounds every .1 second, or 2,400 bullets per minute. Going by in-game rates, the cost of each bullet would be over $800 a piece. Which would be 9,600 dollars per twelve seconds and individual cartridge would cost 160,000 dollars and they weigh of an individual bullet what closest bullets able to fire from a chain gun like heavy's 7.62x51mm rounds weigh about 25.5 in grams and in pounds 0.05621788 pounds added to together 200 hundred rounds weighs about 11 pounds in total that means the Chain gun and bullets weigh about 342 pounds summed up. The bullets per minutes(Fire Rate) is in 2,400 bullets per minute which is actually on the lower side of what chain guns can get up to the measurement for mounted Chain guns in the late 1960s is 6,000 rounds per minute, or 100 rounds per second. But I decided I wanna see how much this ammo would cost today since back then they inflation the cost for one cartridge Today would be 1,386,800.00 dollars and the cumulative rate of inflation would be 766.8%.",0,1585682898,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsjgmj/sasha/,gaming,3

fsj7af,Dotaproffessional,Early 2020 Game of the Year Contenders So Far,"Its early to be looking at ""game of the year"" contenders, but now as we're about 25% of the way through the year, some of the games that have come out might end up being the game of the year (plenty have the potential so far). So lets take a look at games that have come out so far and speculate which might have the legs to be game of the year. 

So far the big games to launch that might have what it takes are: 

* Ori and the Will of the Wisps

* Doom Eternal

* Half-Life: Alyx

* Persona 5: Royal 

* Resident Evil 3 Remake

* Animal Crossing: New-Horizons

* Dragonball Z: Kakarot 

* The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners 

* WarCraft 3: Reforged

* Bleeding Edge


I believe those were all of the major publisher releases but if I'm missing any I'm sure you'll let me know. Of course there were doubtless hundreds of very good indie games that released so far in 2020, but those rarely are in the considering for game of the year unless they get a lot of media attention. 

Of the games so far, the ones I think most likely to be game of the year material all launched within 3 days of each other. 

These are doom, animal crossing, and half life. 

Animal crossing is considered very good by fans of the series, and it came at the perfect time with all of the self isolation going on. Doom eternal is a wild ride of a game that's got a lot of acclaim. Early criticisms seem to be to the effect of ""by the first 3-4 hours, you've pretty much seen most of what's there and the rest of the game can get repetitive"" but generally, its been almost unanimously praised. And then the game on the list with the highest critical praise according to aggregate sites like metacritic and IGN's first 10/10 in literally years, there's Half-Life: Alyx

Personally, I believe this game is the most likely of the ones released so far to be a game of the year contender. Its the game that feels the most different from any other game we've played up until now. Its simultaneously the first AAA (hell, with a name like half life, AAAA) game to release on vr. Its polished to a mirror shine, paced extraordinarily well, scary when it wants to be, and somehow looks like a modern 2020 AAA game despite running well on dated hardware and running at vr's requisite high frame rates. 

We'll have to see if any titles down the road can beat it out. We still have cyberpunk, halo, the last of us, and plenty more. But of the games released so far in 2020, Half life alyx is my 2020 game of the year pick. 

What do you guys think? Did i miss any huge games? Do any of the ones listed feel like game of the year material to you? Do you think any games coming out later this year have what it takes? I look forward to hearing your responses",11,1585682080,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsj7af/early_2020_game_of_the_year_contenders_so_far/,gaming,1

fsgqdv,Shnutmeister,What does gaming mean to you?,"Hello everyone!
Yes I know, a very vague and a not so creative question but hear me out...

Gaming for me started out as a good past time distraction, but as I grew older it became a passion where it brought all my family and friends closer together, having fun, making memorable moments and bringing sheer happiness. 

The most memorable moment for me was back in the days when I was 6 years old or so, on a school night my dad would sneak into my room at midnight and wake me up to play Mario Party on the Game Cube for hours on end. The rest is history.

I don't see gaming as a crime, I see it as a true passion for me with incredible communities that can be reached out with only a few clicks of a button and quite frankly makes me extremely, infinitely proud to be a ""Gamer""/""Nerd"" or whatever you want to call it.

So I ask you, what does gaming mean to you guys?",5,1585674380,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsgqdv/what_does_gaming_mean_to_you/,gaming,5

It's a PS4 v2 controller but I am not sure can I use it in my PC. I know a lot of people will say get the Xbox One controller but they are really expensive here compared to PS4. 
This controller doesn't come with any usb cable but has bluethoot built in. Sadly my PC doesn't have bluethoot so that kinda worries me and that's why am I asking this question.

so my parents offered me to buy 2 games which is very rare since they never buy me anything, I have a PS4 and a Switch Lite which a bought a week ago (bought both with my own money) and I’m not sure which games I should get, here are some stuff I want or don’t want in a game:

I don’t need a deep story or lore just something fun
I don’t need perfect game mechanics 
I want a game that has good combat/exploring system
I like a game that has aesthetically pleasing areas to explore 
I like any type of graphics(cartoonish/realistic)
I like a game that you can grind when you feel like it
I can only play during the weekend
I don’t want a game that’s too short(more than 8 hours at least)
I like a good soundtrack

fsegd5,Curse3242,Some game recommendations please (PC),"Any game recommendations, I just don't like JRPGs or RPGs

I want some connection to the story the game always has, and it shouldn't feel like game has constant downtime

*But that dosent mean I only want story*. I recently played **HOLLOW KNIGHT** and liked it. I'm usually not to keen on eerie feeling games. But I did like GOW when I played it (I've always loved GOW so it could've played a part).

But another game I played recently that would translate what I like is **FURI**. The game is almost constant action, story is decent but the music and how it introduces you to stuff is amazing

I like constant action (although if its pointless then again, not a fan). I was surprised when I liked **AC Odyssey** (first 10 hours were really great, rest was alright). The game had a cycle, and even tho the horse riding parts were a problem. There was quick travel here which mitigated auto Horse Travel to 1-2 mins. 

To suprise, I thought **WATCH DOGS 2** was decent too. In watch dogs 2 I loved how you could fast travel literally anywhere, and it clearly said which line is main missions. So even tho it was quite average, I liked I was **constantly getting into action**

I tried **WITCHER 3** and **FALLOUT 4**. Played WITCHER but I personally didn't like the 30 mins I played, I had to walk quite a lot, and horse ride quite a lot. And I was still in until I realised game was basically going to be **DO THIS QUEST AND I'LL THEN TAKE THE STORY FORWARD**. Not to say I don't like that, but for already set up interesting plot, killing a beast didn't really excite me. Although I'm keen to give it a try if it gets better (and there are sites to guide me to just the main missions)

Fallout 4 , again, I liked the story they showed at the start, but then it was just walking and looting. Only played it for a hour, but didn't like it too much.

fse0kl,tmutimer,RPG as good as FF12,"Hi,
Ive played FF12 a few times through since it came out, and I liked the flowing things:
- open world, non-linear
- deep party customisation
- good music
- grinding, but not over the top
- end game challenges (hunts etc)
- good story with (mostly) good acting
- not a funnelled, easy game. The threat of dying is there, but no so much that it loses meaning.

What game (PS4) would you most recommend? 

I'm aware of the persona series but never got into it. Also it doesn't necessarily have to be a JRPG.

(Oh and I played FFXIII, FFXIII-2, and started FFXV, but none lived up to XII for me)",7,1585665446,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fse0kl/rpg_as_good_as_ff12/,gaming,1

fsdoaa,SmokeEagleSam-Twitch,New FiveM Server California State RolePlay," Welcome to the California State RP Community. - [https://discord.gg/4ATqFPj](https://discord.gg/4ATqFPj)  

&amp;#x200B;

Our unique approach to realism and professionalism along with a family orientated style of role play is what we plan on to mold this community. Having a place where people get together is one thing, but having a community that is built off of the love of gaming and the willingness to better yourself and the people around you is what makes the California RP an outstanding community to be apart of.  We have spent countless hours, minutes, and seconds creating a standard, a way of life, and last but not least a fan base. We pride ourselves knowing that we can provide entertainment for the amazing Players. Our half decade of experience pushes us to become better than the day before, striving to stand out and be unique, to be ourselves and to do what we love most. Role Play.  

Thank you  

We want to thank; you, our Staff, Administration, fans, and members of the California State Role Play community for taking the time to dedicate yourself and thrive this community that we call home.

**FBI  Federal Bureau of Investigation -**  You should join Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) because, we treat each other like family and respect one and each other. We are United State’s first line of defence for high-priority crimes, for example, finding people that have warrants for mass murder and terrorist attacks/threats. FBI is one of the most highly trained ones out on the line of duty, when you join FBI you get a second family and we respect each other and we got each others back. To get into the Secret Service you must be high-up in FBI and get chosen by FBI directors to protect some of the most powerful individuals in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

**FAA Federal Aviation Administration** \- On this server we have locked Planes and Helicopters behind a wall as we found everyone was abusing the power to be able to fly! This is why we have made this, you must undertake training before getting your desired License ( Helicopter - Plane ) Once you have the training you can fly anything as long as its in RP

Gang Discord -  You should join gangs as it will improve your role play experience as you will meet many other players who enjoy role playing with different experiences that can share and help improve and build your role play. When you join a gang it gives you a sense of community as you will always have someone to talk to and play with, being part of a gang also helps the server as all role play scenes in a gangs will involve more than just two people and gang role play scenes can last up to 2 hours! Being in a gang helps to meet others out side of role play as if you are close with someone in a gang they could introduce you to new friends, for example Sam joined my mafia and we became mates and same with all people in here from Vendetta. I hope to see you soon, Dill P.

I don’t need a deep story or lore just something fun
I don’t need perfect game mechanics 
I want a game that has good combat/exploring system
I like a game that has aesthetically pleasing areas to explore 
I like any type of graphics(cartoonish/realistic)
I like a game that you can grind when you feel like it
I can only play during the weekend
I don’t want a game that’s too short(more than 8 hours at least)
I like a good soundtrack

I have a ps4 pro which I play on a small screen to the back of the room however iv decided to buy a longer hdmi lead to connect it to my 4k tv. The small monitor I use isint 4k. I'm doing this so i can use the ps4 as a media centre netflix disney plus now tv ect but also so i can just chill out and ly on the couch when playing offline. So here's what I have done i bought a long 4k hdmi and a hdmi switch. Now all components work correctly as should individually. Sonic plugged into my ps4 pro a 1m 4k hdmi and that goes into the switch. Then a standard hdmi for my small monitor from the switch to the screen and a 10m 4k from switch to the big tv. Now when I press the switch h to turn it to the small monitor all is good and working fine however when I then press to turn it to the 4k tv nothing just a blank screen no sound. I can hear sound through my headset still but it's as if it's not registering the tv at all. Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated thanks,0,1585661092,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fscuq7/can_anyone_help_ps4_pro_hdmi_switch/,gaming,1

fsbz2c,DangerCloseTuber,Pay-to-Grief Instead of Pay-to-Win Model,"While browsing the threads the other day and reading about how common the practice of griefing in video games (and even other types of games) truly is, as well as how much time and dedication some griefers are willing to spend, an idea occurred to me. Most gamers hate the pay-to-win model some games seem to run on (especially free-to-play ones), while there are hordes of griefers constantly trying to circumvent the rules and admins in order to have fun. What if games started taking this opportunity to sell temporary ""griefing passes"", while entirely dumping the unfairness of the pay-to-win model?

&amp;#x200B;

First, for those of you who may be unfamiliar with the term, griefing is a part of multiplayer gaming, but it doesn't constitute as playing the game in the strict sense. A griefer doesn't play the game as intended, doesn't care about whatever objective the game sets for them or their team. A griefer uses all possible in-game mechanics to disrupt other players in pursuing said objective for fun. True griefing is limited only to in-game methods and mechanics, though, and has nothing to do with flaming messages, threats, insults, revealing a player's personal information etc. That is cyberbullying, or worse, and should never be tolerated. Griefing also thrives on internet anonymity. Yes, it is possible to target a certain player for a longer period of time in order to elicit more drastic responses, but the true spirit of griefing lies in neither the griefer nor the target knowing each other's identity at the end of the gaming session. Griefing a person you know from real life has more to do with extending an out-of-game conflict to an in-game situation.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, when it comes to griefing in its purest form, a griefer has no specific personal reason for choosing the targets, like harassing or punishing a player responsible for defeat in a previous match or anything like that. If you log on with the intention to actually play the game, only to have an individual piss you off and make you spend the rest of the session ruining that person's fun in order to vent your frustration, that's trolling and revenge. Griefing, on the other hand, means you logged on intending to spend the session that way in the first place. You weren't angry or frustrated, you had no higher goal in mind. If you're truly a griefer, you have no other reason to do it except to have fun and enjoy yourself. It's a regular part of gaming for you, not something you resort to when other stuff didn't go your way. You may decide to specifically pick on targets who are either doing exceptionally well in a match, or are continuously failing and are already angry, but only because both of those players are much more likely to react more drastically to someone interfering with their game.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, despite many players saying that griefers do their thing because they're bad players who can't enjoy the game properly, that's pretty far from the truth. One day a player can play a game and compete for the objective, enjoying their time regardless of victory or defeat. The next day they may decide to grief instead. The same way you and I will decide every day between reading a book or watching a movie. Two unrelated activities, and both can be fun depending on your mood and preferences.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll describe a personal example. When I was a kid, I used to play basketball with friends from time to time. We would meet up, go to the schoolyard, and spend hours playing matches or just shooting at the basket. It was a very enjoyable part of my childhood I'll always remember dearly. On some other days, I'd take my basketball, go to the schoolyard alone, and find a group of unknown kids playing soccer. I'd stand on the wall above the goal, and keep trying to hit their ball with my own to make it bounce off and mess with them. I was ecstatic just as much. However, I soon learned the advantages of internet anonymity when said kids grabbed and destroyed my basketball. Fast forward to my high school, and I was quite a dedicated Modern Warfare 2 player. I attempted griefing a few times for the laughs, but I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as trying to win matches. Later I bought Battlefield Bad Company 2, and played it for quite some time. Maybe 10% of may playtime was spent going after the objective. The remaining 90% of the time I spent teamkilling, damaging and destroying friendly vehicles, blowing up cover, messing with teammates with friendly fire, destroying my own objectives, driving teammates off map limits and so on. It was a completely different experience, yet just as enjoyable as all the hundreds of hours spent in MW2 over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, back to the topic. It should be noted that games usually have numerous rules designed specifically to suppress griefing. That is understandable, as having a large portion of players continuously griefing at the same time would render the game unplayable. However, imagine a model where a customer could pay additional money in order to acquire a temporary ""griefing pass"". That pass would automatically lift all limitations on stuff like friendly fire and teamkilling, destruction of friendly players' property, obstruction of other players' movement etc., regardless of the admin being an automatic bot or an actual person observing the player's behavior or reviewing recorded sessions. It could be sold at various price ranges, with longer lasting passes becoming a lot more expensive (e.g. 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h...). For individuals ready to spend some serious cash, monthly options could be made available, like 30 min or 1 h a day. And in case a griefer is willing to spend a literal fortune every month, they could buy an unlimited monthly pass.

&amp;#x200B;

Once a player buys the pass, they could choose when to activate and deactivate it. It would count down the time only while active, during actual sessions of gameplay. That would prevent unfairness of a match unexpectedly ending early, and a waste of precious time in a pre-match lobby. Once active, though, it wouldn't only allow the player to grief legally. It would also lift all restrictions on actions of other players against said player. That means everyone would be allowed to defend themselves and resist without punishment of any kind using in-game methods against such griefers. It would limit the destructive impact of the griefing player, as well as making it more fun for the griefer, as most griefers enjoy the targets reacting to their actions and fighting back. All players with active griefing passes would be indicated with a special icon or something, so the other players know they can take measures against them freely.

&amp;#x200B;

You may be now wondering why this theoretical model would be better than existing pay-to-win concepts, and that's reasonable. Having a bunch of psycho players running around disrupting the fun of everyone else likely sounds just as bad as constantly losing to players who spend more money on the game than you. Well, the pay-to-win model is much, much worse. Why? Because it gives in-game advantage to players actually playing for the objective. It allows people to become better players, win more often, even make a name for themselves in online communities, and in turn make more money online to spend even more on pay-to-win features. It can become a cycle feeding itself, leading to the top players on the leader board getting there and staying there simply due to having money. They are the elite, the top dogs, and no amount of skill and dedication will allow free-to-play players, or those who just paid for the base game, to consistently win against such individuals. It ruins the competition and makes everyone not paying extra money ultimately feeling like having a demo version of the game, and being there to serve as meager henchman for the heroes to slaughter.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, buying griefing passes wouldn't make anyone known as a good player. They wouldn't be regarded as the elite, but the scum of the community. They would have no edge in actual competition. They would get their personal enjoyment and nothing else. To those serious about playing the game and competing, the dedication and skill would finally pay off. Matches would be played normally, with occasional griefers evenly distributed among all sides. And players would be allowed to legally combat the griefers, which is certainly easier than winning against money-spending players in pay-to-win games. Of course, there would be no griefers affecting the e-sport scene.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, the griefing passes would be expensive. Even the cheapest ones would be something most players would be willing to afford themselves on a daily basis, not even weekly. It would prevent mass griefing, while the gaming studios would still get the money they need from a smaller, but richer and more dedicated griefing crowd. In an ideal world, maybe even the studios who never planned to make a pay-to-win game would decide to implement the pay-to-grief model, which may in turn drop the base price of games for non-griefers. Since games are generally becoming more and more expensive, everyone would profit. The studios wouldn't be at a financial loss, the regular players would enjoy a much more fair competition (and potentially pay less for the base game), and the griefers would have their fun without risking reports, bans and other issues.",19,1585657380,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsbz2c/paytogrief_instead_of_paytowin_model/,gaming,1

fsbiyh,plock-me,[help] csgo- screen freezes but game continues," Hey guys. I use a mac (please save the rant about gaming on mac for later) and i recently bootcamped into windows 10 and started csgo. Since day 1, everytime i get killed/open buy menu or at random times, my screen freezes but the game continues and i can hear myself shoot,move and the surroundings. This has never happened to me before on macOS.

I tried:

reinstalling intel graphics drivers, updated them

verifying game files

fsb67r,belarskio,I really dont like the direction Minecraft is heading,"Im probably going to get a lot of hate for this but just hear me out. Most of these new updates that are scheduled for Minecraft are just gimmicks in my opinion and  just serve to bring people back for a week and leave or to appeal to small children. Dont get me wrong, I dont dislike the updates but the people who actually stick around for the game and play a lot truly dont care about the updates and the devs time would be better spent adding stuff that truly brings more to the game. The reason they are doing this is because the people who pay more are the players who come back for a short period of time because they buy skin packs and possibly new ports of the games while the people who really like the game bought all they are going to buy for the most part. Also small children buy a lot of texture packs and skin packs. The reason its so effective is because a good portion of the community just came back temporarily. Dont get me wrong I dont dislike those players I just dislike what Minecraft is doing, Goats? Termites? Pandas?(yes im aware pandas are from a while ago) Really? Examples of really good updates are Village and Pillage, aquatic, end update, Adventure update. Those updates really brought stuff to the game while these ones are mainly just things you look at once and go, hmm interesting and move on. I am certainly not insulting anyone because I am fine with temporary players, small children and people who just generally like the new updates but Im just saying my opinions.

In other words these new updates bring nothing to the game and I really dont like them except for a couple exceptions.",14,1585653586,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsb67r/i_really_dont_like_the_direction_minecraft_is/,gaming,1

fsb24b,AbjiriPatchiri,Looking for the gem of my childhood," Hello fellow gamers,

I come to you with something that has troubled me for a very long time. See, back when I was a kid, whenever I'd go to my cousin's house, we'd boot up her computer and play a certain game that I particularly loved, but never came to know the name of. Eventually, the computer stopped working and was thrown out, and I never got to play it again. Every so often I remember it and try to discover its name but always come up empty. My cousin has already given up, but I'm still hopeful, so I decided to come to you for help!

Here's everything that I remember about the game:

\- this was around the second half of the 00's i guess, I only recall playing it as a kid, can't pinpoint a year at all

\- it was by levels (I think you'd reset to the first level when you lost?)

\- you played as a dot in a square/rectangle - i'm gonna call it the canvas

\- each level started out with a black canvas

\- the objetive was to reveal the image of the canvas (when you reached the vast majority - probably like 90%, it'd complete the rest)

\- you could move around in the borders and inside the canvas, never outside

\- when you went from one place of a border of the canvas to another, the section of the image corresponding to the portion of the canvas you ""closed"" would be revealed

\- as you traversed inside of the canvas, a line was drawn describing your path

\- there were ""enemies"" moving around inside the canvas

\- if an enemy touched your line before you connected it to another border of the canvas, you would lose

\- the portion of the image that appeared was always the smaller one - if you drew a line from the left border to the right border dividing the screen 40/60, the 40% of the screen would be filled with the image

\- if you managed to ""catch"" an enemy in the section you closed off, it would disappear

\- each level had a different image

\- as you progressed in levels, there would be more enemies in the canvas (i don't remmber if there were different kinds as well)",1,1585653026,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsb24b/looking_for_the_gem_of_my_childhood/,gaming,1

fsarwm,Team_coffee_cup,So I indirectly birthed a subreddit that I think people here would find cool!,"r/GamefyMe

So the idea behind it is pretty accurately explained in my comment that started it all.  

'I often think how cool it would be if there was a subreddit where people post a selfie (or 2 or 3 from different angles), say which game (e.g. Fallout 4) they want and then leaves the subreddit to make as accurate a version of them as possible. Then the winner dms the OP the preset settings.' ""  

There are some very talented and dedicated people on this website, but me and many others (who like to try to make their characters look like them) are absolute doo-doo at character creation in games. Could be a bit of fun, eh? 

Is this self-promotion? Well yes AND no. I think the idea behind it is very cool and would love to see it gain traction, other than this post though I won't be a moderator or anything (TOO MUCH PRESSURE AGGGH) so I'm not looking to fuel a power boner or anything.

It needs a bit of a leg-up from people who know how to run subreddits and that so any help or members would be great!",4,1585651608,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fsarwm/so_i_indirectly_birthed_a_subreddit_that_i_think/,gaming,1

fs948c,FellatiatedPiece,[opinion] super mario sunshine is a better game than mario osysee (here's why),"To clerify I loved mario odysee quite a bit but as I sat and played it there was something about it nagging me and it took me weeks to figure out what but here it is.

Super mario 64 and super mario sunshine both are structured the same way with a hub where you go into worlds and pick a star/shine to attempt to get, and in odysee you have a ship and go to the worlds to then go searching for moons, in super mario 64 and sunshine when you get a star/shine it pulls you out of the world back to the hub area, then in odysee when you get a moon you just keep going on in the world.


This all seems like it was a great change because you could keep playing and exploring the place without being pulled out of the gameplay, however this one thing is why I believe that odysee, while it may have better controls and visuals than the other two games, is ultimately not on the same tier as those older games are.

Ok, finally, all that was to say this, the hub structured games are far superior and far more replayable because of one simple thing, world states.

In the older games when you jump into a painting and select what goal to go after you're actually just selecting a different world state, sure you might go into one level several times but there's usually something new about it each time and in some cases nintendo got really clever about using it, especially in mario 64 where a level might be different depending on how you chose to jump into the painting.

Point is the world states make the games feel way more varied than the open ish world system odysee has going on.

fs8iyx,lazerbeam98,Significant frame drops while gaming.,"So the lockdown in my country has got me gaming for most part of the day. I've noticed a significant drop (almost 40-50%) in games that previously used to give a really high frame rate. My specs:-
CPU: i7-7700K
GPU: ZOTAC GTX 1080 AMP EXTREME EDITION
MoBo: Asus Z270E
RAM: 16GB
144Hz 1080p Monitor

I recently cleaned out my PC Cabinet (dusting an all) plus updated my drivers to version 445.75. Used to get easy 130+ frames ultra battlefield 1, minimum 80. Now I average around 70-80, if i look up at the sky or ground, jumps to 144. I get constant 144 frames in the menu but moment game starts frames hit the 70-80 range. 
This has never happened before and worries me little since this is not exactly my field of expertise plus I can't have anyone take a look at it due to the lockdown. Same happens with COD Warzone, was breezing around 130-144 frames before, now down to 60-65. Is this something I should be worried about? What should/can be done? 

P.S: My card has the famous Zotac issue of fans turning on and off and creating a rattling sound when fans speed below 30% but I have adjusted the curve so that the fans turn off below that temperature.",8,1585639487,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fs8iyx/significant_frame_drops_while_gaming/,gaming,1

I'm fortunate in many ways to still have some control over work and life. I'm certainly not asking for sympathy, but I am looking for tips. 

My struggle is that I can't seem to focus on any game at all right now. I have a large library of beloved games I've acquire over the past 20 years or so, but I can't play any of them for more than 10 minutes without feeling overwhelmed.  I have a long list of games I mean to watch/read tutorials about and ""once I do that this game will be so amazing"" but I can't watch more than a few minutes without jumping back on Twitter or finding a snack. 

I try to inspire myself by watching some favorite streamers but it all seems so...  insignificant.

This from a gamer who has been playing video games since he was 2 in 2000. Every gamer knows the story of how ET eviscerated Atari and it lead to the great video game crash. I think that's coming again. I think we are on the brink of a new video gaming depression/crash. Video games had a golden age in the 2000s to early 2010s. Then the powers that be at EA came along and decided to snap up once beloved studios who made popular and well received games and milk their properties dry, make shitty new releases that lack all the magic the original studios brought to the table, and add in a endless wave of Microtransactions, ingame purchases, subscription services, and lootboxes.

We dismissed this as EA just getting greedy, but soon more studios began following this trend. Stopping caring about fans, running beloved properties into the ground, not giving fans what they want, and flaunting their greed. The mobile game developer Gameloft is another good example. They used to be one of a kind on the Itunes Appstore. They made small rpg games for mobile, that didn't have inapp purchases.

Sure they weren't cheap for mobile games but it felt like a pc or console gaming experience. Then they stopped updating those games and took them off the store then released a onslaught of those shitty games where you have to spend hundreds of dollars to do anything without waiting months to get anywhere. EA also jumped on that bandwagon.

Again we dismissed this as a isolated incident. Then the unthinkable happened. Bethesda game studios ruined fallout. They made mistake after mistake after mistake, including doxxing all their players, lying to players, and adding in the endless microtransactions and lootboxes and the dreaded subscription service.

Ubisoft next fell to the greed curse, adding in special rewards for paying players, a ingame currency, and even no longer releasing their games on steam anymore so people are forced to directly give them money.

The Creative Assembly is next. First they made a warhammer series no one asked for. They released way more dlc then usual for it. Now they have completely stopped caring about the only historical title they have announced in a while after 4 successful bad and mediocre games. All these studios knew what we wanted but they didn't care. They just wanted to line their pockets.

People really wanted half life 3 but valve chose to work with Steam 100% because it makes them all their money.

I fear that as more and more game studios fall to greed and stopping caring about their fanbase, it may ruin the entire gaming industry irreparably.",9,1585632372,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fs74it/i_think_we_may_be_entering_another_video_game/,gaming,1

fs72ef,tognabologna92,Please help me find this game!!,"So, I used to play this game in the 90s or early 2000s. Our computer was likely running windows 95 or 98 at the time. It was like a first person point and click, puzzle/maze kind of game. You started outside of a castle, and your first objective is to find a key to get in. The key is hidden in a particular brick on the outside wall of the castle. You enter the castle and theres 3 doors you can take. One leads to like a room with a table or something, one has a hallway with a guard (maybe 2) and the other hallways has other rooms and a locked door or something.... 

Granted, I haven't played this game since I was kid, so I could have some of the info here wrong. But, the game from what I remember was totally first person. You didnt see the character at all.

But the debate was (his) that Halo multiplayer revolutionized online gaming the most which i disagreed with.  I considered Counter Strike was the bigger game, more revolutionary, and has/had vastly more player count than Halo ever did.

fs682l,Austinoooooo,Annnnd now I gotta decide...,"Got $60 bucks to possibly spend on either REmake3 or the Modern Warfare 2 remastered campaign.  

This sucks. I remember the fun I had with the original MW2 campaign, and I’m hoping that buying the campaign, eventually they’ll release a multiplayer mode for free to all who own the game.   

Yet, I also just beat REmake2 and had a blast with that. I’ve been playing a few of the other Resident Evil games and I’m enjoying those so far. I’d love to see where Capcom goes with this remake. 

I’m literally gonna flip a coin the day they’re both available and go from there.

My top three games to give an idea of what I like: Sims, GTA V, Detroit: Become Human. My favorite type of game is choose your own adventure, so basically I’ve played every game by Quantic Dream and LOVED them. But I’m open to similar things as well! Story driven games are where it’s at for me as I’m not the best at shooters/combat games, but I’m not completely opposed to them as I love GTA. I do adore the Sims but am not crazy about other simulation games (like the ones where you spend a lot of the time just farming items and there’s not much story to it don’t appeal to me).

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

They concern a planet of strange creatures and the mega-coropations that use them as slave labor. The last game releashed was Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath in 2005. It was such a unique series, and it had great humor and cutscenes, that it honestly bums me out that there hasn't been a new one in 15 years.

fs5aef,HankScorpio20,Should I get an Xbox One X now in case Xbox Series X is delayed or there are severe shortages or just wait for Series X?,"I'm getting a bit hyped talking to my friend about possibly buying an Xbox Series X. We both game on PS4 Pro and have been on Team PlayStation the last two gens. But we're seriously considering switching to Xbox. I currently own an Xbox One S digital edition. I own a 4K TV but only one port does 4K HDR 60hz and that's obviously used by the PS4 Pro. The rest of my ports only do 4K 30hz so I felt a One X would've been a waste and not fully utilized on my a TV. Anyways, I love PS4 but I'm considering making the switch to Xbox NOW and I'm thinking of getting a One X and just buying more multi platform games on it cuz I've heard multi plats look, play, run better on One X. Or should I wait til next gen to make the move? Would it be a wise purchase in case the Series X is delayed or there's shortages and it's hard to get a Series X?

fs57aq,Andrew-Heaton,An interesting idea for the developers of DOOM Eternal and Animal Crossing: New Horizons,"As we’ve all seen, the fans of DOOM Eternal and Animal Crossing: New Horizons have both been getting along quite well recently. Both games were released on the same day and are almost polar opposites when it comes to the atmosphere, but that has not stopped people from making fan art of Isabelle and the Doomslayer together in one of the games or doing the others duty. I (personally) think that it would be very interesting and cool for both games to commemorate the coming together of both communities despite the differences in their games. This would be a customization option in both games. In DOOM Eternal there could be an outfit that is equipable in the game. The outfit could be the 2016 Doomslayer but with the Isabelle head as the helmet/head, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons could make a Doomslayer outfit in their game as well. This could appeal to both communities and even lead to some getting the game themselves out of pure interest. I think that this would be awesome. This is a legitimate idea that I had and honestly want to see happen.",4,1585623897,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fs57aq/an_interesting_idea_for_the_developers_of_doom/,gaming,1

fs562c,Benjamin_Lawman,Gamers stay unite no matter the condition!,"Sorry for spelling errors. English is not my fluent language currently.

Before everything of the corona and yadda yadda, I was at a supermarket with my Zelda jacket and my The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild headphones. Now, many kids point at me for having so much Zelda related stuff on me but this encounter was something that I will never forget although it lasted less than a second thanks to my anxiety.

I was minding my own business, walking around in the food area when I feel someone touch my shoulder in a pretty harsh way to be my brother. I get spoked, lower my headphones and facing the person. He seemed like a grown up around 18-19 but don't listen to me. He tried to speak with me but couldn't so he made a gesture of Link pulling the sword out of a pedestal. Of course, making weird noises and looking at his hands then at me then pointing at me then at his hands making gestures and forcing himself to speak. Now I know what is going on. He was mute. I know nothing of sign language but if I could, I'd pull a cool conversation with him. Sadly my legs did not stopped as I watched him because I was kinda in a hurry. I smiled, nodded understanding somewhat of what he said but before I could even reply, he ran towards what I think it was his mother and pointed at me making again the Link pulling a sword from a pedestal gesture and some other ones. The mother looked at me but a wall separated us. I thought it was the last time I would see someone so cool until when I was waiting outside for a pick up, I saw him helping his mother carry the groceries to the car. He did not noticed me until he opened his door and sat down. He waved as he smiled and yet again tried to tell his mother about me. 

It was a truly amazing encounter. If I could go back to the past and stop my hurry, we would be now gamer friends. Yet again, time travel doesn't exist so he is now a memory that I would never forget.",3,1585623755,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fs562c/gamers_stay_unite_no_matter_the_condition/,gaming,1

Every once and a while I buy a new game (as usual), and I do something when I’m playing the game for the first time (i.e. Going to the beach, drinking a certain soda, listening to a song, etc.) and that ties into my memory of the game. Now, whenever I go to that place or drink that soda or smell a candle, I get a weird desire to play a game whose memory is correlated to that scent or sound or place. An example would be the Scentsy in my room. (The device you plug into your wall and it melts a good smelling wax.) There is a certain wax that has this cinnamon-apple smell and it makes me want to play Skyrim. But only Skyrim. When we go to the beach, I want to play Starlink. When I drink A&amp;W or Crush, I want to play DOOM 1993. It’s super weird, and I want to see if anyone else has that happen to them.

fs36c0,DecentFart,"PSA: Currently, cannot transfer switch animal crossing save data from one console to another.","Almost had a crisis on my hands earlier this evening when we tried transferring my gf to a new switch lite. Using the built in user data transfer method we moved her account to the new switch lite. When doing the transfer the user account and save data is deleted from the source switch. We put animal crossing in the new switch lite with her account on it and it opened to no existing island. We looked this up and found articles stating that save data transfer is not support for this game via the local transfer utility or the cloud data backup. Thankfully, we moved her user back to the original switch and when opening the game her island was still there. Crisis averted.

fs2ezf,shmoster,The Skateboarding Game I’ve always wanted,"Name: Pro Skater
Platform: PS4 XB1 PC
ESRB rating: M

Pro Skater would be a spiritual successor to Tony Hawk Underground, which is debatably the best in the Tony Hawk franchise. The game would play much like Underground in terms of tricks and controls.

Set in the late 90s to early 00s, the game has an in depth story with your detailed created Skater. He has no money and lives with a friend. The game takes place in one big city, whether it’s LA, Phili, or some other place, it’s a sprawling environment where you find your favorite “spot.” Think of GTA 5 but with a skateboard and with more skate-friendly rails and ledges. Ramps could be added later with ingame money

The missions involve you filming your own sponsor video that you would edit together. First, you’d have to scrape together money for the camera itself and even an old crappy car to help you get around. Some mini games involve your car or other vehicles all helping you get more dough.

Like a lot of recent titles, you’d have decisions in dialogue to make friends and enemies around town, who would help you or hurt you in the long run. Drug dealers would make a threatening antagonist group who would end up stealing your gear or car. You maybe could end up having to juggle a love life and choose to build that or hone your skating skills more, with both affecting the world differently

Ultimately the game is about skating, finding killer spots and decking them out to shoot sweet footage. The antagonists and love life elements help break up some monotony and add immersion to playing a young skater punk growing up in the 90s or 00s.

This game doesn’t exist but oh boy... I’d pay full price for it today. Get some nostalgia and make an old franchise packed with everything it’s always needed",0,1585613200,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fs2ezf/the_skateboarding_game_ive_always_wanted/,gaming,1

fs2dl1,Sovarius,Examples of enemies or bosses that scale in some form of difficulty based on player/character progression?,"Hi!

I'm looking for examples in games, particularly RPGs but any, where enemies scale based on player accomplishments or level. Scaling based on your level (for RPGs anyway) is the easiest and most formulaic method, but i'm wondering if any games have bosses that are more difficult because of other accomplishments besides grinding? Or if any games have bosses that become more difficult in other ways besides boosted stats?

An example would be Sephiroth in Final Fantasy 7 - the game checks if you've recruited optional characters, if you've retrieved a certain optional summon, character levels and how many have reached the 99 max, etc. So it does merely check your level, in part, but it also checks a couple other accomplishments. Then it's manifested in multiple ways, the first being simply boosted health and other stats if you have characters at max level, but also the final battle separates your party into 2 or 3 groups depending on levels as well, giving you smaller parties.",5,1585613057,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fs2dl1/examples_of_enemies_or_bosses_that_scale_in_some/,gaming,1

I'm getting back into gaming due to staying at home. I'm searching for a game that rivals the multiplayer of World at War. What I liked about COD WAW is that the matches had people at my skill level so that I could increase my skills without being demolished every round. That and capture the flag was my favorite type of match.

I've tried Destiny 2, CS: GO, Fist Full of Frags, Dirty Bomb, Survarium, and Quake III. Quake III was the funnest of all the games I tried. None of them leave me wanting to come back and play. Battlefield V looks fun but I don't want to spend $40 and not enjoy it.

fs1f16,backin1444,Game recommendations for someone who never plays,"Hello, everyone.  I never play video games normally, but obviously these circumstances are anything but normal.  I've been wondering if there's some kind of game out there for me, that I could get into to help kill some hours through the day and take my mind off current events.  For a reference, the last gaming system I owned and played was the N64.

I'm not about to go out and buy a new system, so it would have to something you can play on a laptop.  Looking for something more story-based, and not very action-heavy.  

Preferably something with a lot of interacting with other people online, but if it's a really good game I could go either way.  

As you can probably tell, I'm not very knowledgable in this world so anything that's overly complicated is going to be too much.  

Any recommendations are appreciated and will be looked into, thanks for reading.",14,1585609556,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fs1f16/game_recommendations_for_someone_who_never_plays/,gaming,1

fs0uu0,Trombonist12,Gaming and my schedule,"How much time, exactly, do I need to set aside for a video game? Just an hour ago I started up Yakuza 0. Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic game so this is not a diss on the game. This particular scenario happens with quite a few games but Yakuza 0 is just the most recent example. I have two hours to kill before I have something on my schedule to do. I played for about 10 minutes before the story missions locked me into a story quest. When I say ""locked in"" I mean a period of time within a game where you can't save, so you are forced to keep playing. I was locked in for about 45 minutes before I actually got the chance to save again. This wasn't a problem as I set aside a good amount of time for the game, but this has happened in games more than a few times in worse time frames where I have to manually quit the game, losing a fair amount of progress just because I had something else to do.  


What's even worse is if you can't pause the game or a cutscene when something else requires my attention. Then I have no choice to lose progress once again just because my dog needed to go outside. Of course, this only happens with select genres, mainly the narrative driven ones, but I hate this phenomenon of having to estimate the max amount of time needed to set aside in order to play games, even when those same games have relatively short missions. I am forced to not play a game that I want to because of the possibility that it may conflict with my schedule. Then the next time I load it up, the missions and cutscenes were relatively short, meaning in hindsight, I could have played that game.

My parents are heavily reluctant on my buying a setup, so my only option was to buy a laptop.. which is what I did 2 years ago.

Now, what I use isn’t a gaming laptop, it isn’t even close to one. I use an HP Laptop 15-db0xxx.

Do you know of any budget things I could buy for my laptop to improve its performance? I’ve been saving up for a long time, but I’ve only been able to scrape together 200 or so dollars.

I’d appreciate any help whatsoever, I really have no clue what I can do to improve it.

fs04kb,Slavonic79,I think I got cubital tunnel from War Thunder,"So I believe I have cubital tunnel since there is nothing else that I could think it would be because I have symptoms from what I read about. I have had this for almost 6 months and I got it from playing PC games and I was on an acne medication at the time and I never took any NSAIDS in the first weeks to months I had it thinking that it would just get better. And of course, it never did het better. My arm hasn't ever been painful, only numb on my lower forearm, ring, and little finger. Also I could tell my nerve was inflamed around my elbow since there would be a weird feeling to it that had a very slight ""pain"" and very slight ""burning"" feeling to it. I tried to keep my arm straight as much as possible, let it rest, not use my PC, not leave my arm on hard flat surfaces for long, etc. But nothing works. About 2 months ago I took ibuprofen for a month (2 times a day) and it didn't really do much except make it not inflamed while the meds were active and it made a rubber-like pad feeling go away completely. After that I purchased a compression sleeve for my arm which is helping reduce the inflammation on my elbow. Then my dad said that he would purchase Naproxen Sodium for me, which I just started taking about once a day about 3 days ago. Another problem is that I can't just go to the doctor myself since I'm just a teen, and my mom won't let me go at all even though I have complained about my arm for almost 6 months + she said that she wouldn't allow me to get surgery on my arm at all. This kind of sucks for me since now I can't really do much and it is starting to make me a bit depressed + if it ends up being permanent I might not be able to join the military since that is something I wanted to do, and I don't think you can join with nerve injury's.

frzil1,CoolCatReddit,My new thoughts on Half-Life,"Alright so I’ll admit it, Half-Life never interested me. I of course wanted a third game, but only because of the meme. After watching a full play through of Half-Life: Alyx, however, I’m so into it. 
I don’t think I’ll play HLA, though. I don’t have the stomach for VR anymore, and I never had the hardware (2016 rift isn’t that good), but I now definitely want to play the 3 games prior to it. 
I’ve always loved Valve games. Portal 1 and 2 were awesome. I never played one, but I got really far in 2. CS:GO, while not a story driven game, is also amazing. 
Even though I spoiled the crap out of the series, I would still love to play it. 

Thank you for reading :)

Side note: As a quick comparison, I never liked Smash either. After my cousin got it for me as a Christmas gift, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope the same thing goes for Half-Life.",0,1585603226,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frzil1/my_new_thoughts_on_halflife/,gaming,1

There should be a system to punish hackers, besides permanent bans, something in the lines of a gaming police that would enforce the consequences.","Go on, call me a dreamer, but I will keep dreaming of the day when cheating in video games will be as risky as robbing a house. After all, I have less respect for video game cheaters than for physical thieves... needless to say I have less than a grain of respect for any thieve to begin with. 

I have worked in cybersecurity (marketing department, my coding skills are very lacking unfortunately) and cybersecurity vendors (such as Kaspersky) are only recently starting to partner up with games (such as PUBG) to find software solutions to better protect/detect cheating softwares in video games. 

Perhaps if gamers were required to disclose their address using a proof of residence or similar documents, there could be repercussions for their unethical behavior. Some stock trading platforms involve such systems for different reasons.

You might be thinking, this is an impossible idea since many gamers (and hence, cheaters) aren’t even 18 years old.

I’d like to hear your opinion about it.,"As I came across steam charts, i’ve noticed that these games: CSGO, R6 Siege,  Rust, ARK. Have reached their all time player peak in Steam in the same time range, (last 30 days) It just seems arbitrary. I wanna ask a questions and i’d like to hear your opinions about it. Why are these games getting so popular in the same time? Maybe the quarantine? But something tells me it’s a coincidence. I don’t really know, there are also a lot of other games that were released this month, Nioh 2, Doom, AC, Warzone, Half-life and many more to come. I wanna hear your opinion why these games just reached their peak time in the same time range. Sorry if this question seems is unusual or random.

fry5n6,AA_Batteries28,Modded Xbox.,"I was digging around my attic this morning and found an original Xbox. I didn’t think much of it until I booted it up. It wasn’t normal, it didn’t have the usual dashboard. There was just a blue background with a few options that said things like ‘Weather’, ‘Photos’, etc. I went to the very end of it and saw a box that said ‘Emulators’
I went on and saw that it had every single NES, SNES, GBA, N64, and original Xbox games on it. So I started playing. I loaded up SMW (Super Mario World) and realised that you could add cheats into the game! If somebody could tell me how much I could sell this for, it would be greatly appreciated.

frxxme,TeamSHURBIN,ESL Gaming screwed me out of prize money and I don't know what to do,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, and it's kind of a long story, but hear me out:

I'm playing in an NBA 2k20 tournament for about 6 hours yesterday, and I can't connect to my next opponent via the in-game matchmaking from ESL (it had encountered this problem a lot in the past). We file a protest and ask the admin what to do. The admin says to play a private match instead (I've done this before successfully). We try, but my opponent's game crashes every time he accepts an invite from me. He never sends me an invite to try to play.

We are explaining what is happening the whole time to the admin in the protest. After about 15 minutes, and with no warning, the admin tells us it has been too long and we are both disqualified. The admin posts:

""The technical problems of each player must be resolved as quickly as possible, ESL can not be held responsible.""

Frankly I don't understand how ESL cannot be held responsible when the matchmaking system is literally their responsibility.

I file a support ticket, and another admin tries to claim I wasn't present. From every angle you look at it, I was in fact present throughout the whole process. The admin then says there is nothing they can do, I'm disqualified, and that I should ""just be more careful next time.""

The worst part is, they awarded my opponent the win for that match, even though they were the ones having trouble connecting to me. They gave them the default win, which placed them rank 9-16 and awarded them $100. If we had just played that game and I won, I would have gotten the $100 and possibly more if I kept winning. But I was disqualified for something that was out of my control.

I really don't know what to do, this is my first time using ESL.

TL,DR: Played in a tournament, got disqualified because my opponent couldn't connect, my opponent got the prize money not me",7,1585598130,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frxxme/esl_gaming_screwed_me_out_of_prize_money_and_i/,gaming,1

First is after Auron tells him his Dad is Sin. Tidus does insist he doesn't believe him, but given how long they spend travelling together (I feel like the game implies it takes a few days to travel between towns), I'd have thought some natural curiosity would spur him to ask some Whys and Hows. I'm sure Auron has reasons he can't be too forward about it but that doesn't explain why Tidus isn't trying to probe a bit.

Same thing when Rikku joins the party. Obviously the question's hanging in the air of why she wants to suddenly join them despite being with the Al Bhed, and why Yuna and Lulu seem to be familiar with her. If not the latter, I'd think Tidus would at least ask about the former. She literally just tried to kidnap Yuna and Tidus is just going along with it.

And again, I'm sure answers are coming, but... Tidus doesn't know that.",1,1585594968,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frwwcv/firsttiming_final_fantasy_x_tidus_lack_of/,gaming,1

frwlky,hgilbert_01,What Draws you into Exploring in Games?,"Hi.

I am curious as to what obligates gamers to explore virtual worlds in video games. Research I've done has landed me in some unreliable, conflicting sources. I'd also rather not read through bloated studies on the topic, so my day will be made if input could be provided, please.

I'll also give my, uh, two ruppees on it. I know that there is a significant amount of interest with the visual storytelling games provide as well as the scenery involved. However, I struggle motivating myself to explore for the sake of enjoying these landmarks.

I have some rather significant anxiety, so much so the extent that I am in a near constant need to be doing something, to be at least semi-engaged with a solitary activity of sorts. This it makes hard for me to aesthetically appreciate the amazing worlds that game designers concot. At least, it is difficult for me to have an appreciation for the sights of the world unless there are associated experiences I have with it. 

Take Super Mario Galaxy, for example... The wacky and imaginative worlds it has are surely appealing upon first sight, but simply trying to slowly and mindfully absorb all of the cute visual details will drive insane with anxiety. In order to keep myself grounded in sanity, I need to play the game and be in movement, the mindful calm I find coming from the joy of controlling Mario and interacting with the level structures. It's then that I see the beauty in the galaxies as they remind me of the fun experiences I had there. 

Applying that logic to more open-ended, exploration games (not exclusive to open world, but maybe think of Super Mario Odyssey's relationship to Galaxy), I form a connection with the places by the journey itself. Taking the visual elements of the world on their own just simply does not work for me. 


I might have more to add in the comments later, but reality is calling me back. :/ Any input you could provide would be immensely appreciated, please.

Thank you.",9,1585594039,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frwlky/what_draws_you_into_exploring_in_games/,gaming,1

frt0mv,shvelgud,Star Wars video games,"While there are plenty of great Star Wars games out there, does no one thirst for a Star Wars game that focuses more on saber-to-saber style duelling?

A game that is built on mechanics similar to For Honour,  but instead of different warriors has an array of different sith and Jedi all with slightly different combos and parry/block styles depending on what form they practice?

You could have some amazing maps like you do in battlefront and genuinely think there’s a gap for a game like this, seeing as other Star Wars games fail to provide a real deep feel to the duelling side of Star Wars, which is where some of the best entertainment comes from.",5,1585582654,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frt0mv/star_wars_video_games/,gaming,2

frszde,vol4lyfe123,Dead Space Absolutely Needs a Next Gen Reboot.,"I'm currently playing through Dead Space 2 for probably my 20th time. I just miss this series so much. 

Dead Space 1 was such a great game. It was the epitome of survival horror. It's a 12 year old game that still holds up pretty well. 

Dead Space 2 is just brilliant and my personal favorite. It's a tad more action oriented, but it's still got that survival horror feel. It made you really feel a sense of despair, isolated with very few people to help you.  

Dead Space 3, while more of an action game than horror, still had it's scary, tense moments. Though, it never really had the sense of isolation the first 2 games had. Story was crazy weird but if you look it as a sort of stand alone action shooter with aliens, it really wasn't too bad. I know the community was pretty split due to MTXs and the general direction EA took it, but I enjoyed it for what it was.

So, next gen is the perfect time for a reboot of the series. I know EA killed the series when DS3 didn't sell well. But I'm still holding out hope for a new Dead Space. I truly feel like single player, survival horror games are making a comeback. Resident Evil 2 was incredible and I feel Resident Evil 3 is going to be fantastic. Half Life Alyx looks absolutely stunning, shame I don't have a VR set. Dropping a new Dead Space soon, with survival horror at it's core, on these next gen consoles would be amazing. 

Look how well Jedi Fallen Order turned out. It shows that EA actually can make great single player games that sell well. EA just really needs to capitalize on this. Bring Dead Space back.",8,1585582547,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frszde/dead_space_absolutely_needs_a_next_gen_reboot/,gaming,1

frrziq,ihwayne,Simple video games?,"So, I'm pushing 40. Grew up with Mario. One of my favorite video games of all time is Mass Effect, and I've played more Halo 3 than I'm proud to admit. I have played games on and off since. Dragon Age games, Alien Isolation, I've played WoW, and Star Wars Galaxies. I'm not afraid of games that are involved. During this lockdown I've tried so many games. Even simple games are so complicated these days. You can't just play, there are always mechanics that take hours to become proficient at. Or if they're simple, like Cuphead, they are frustratingly difficult. And I love the concept of something like Minecraft but I'm not into building (I've played a fair amount of fortnite but, again, the building aspect turns me off)

I'm curious if y'all could point me in the direction of some games that are simple and most importantly FUN! Obviously, fun is subjective. The more I type the more it sounds like I'm a gamer who doesn't like games. I want to like these games, but, I think I need something a bit more mindless.

frrfao,Grooooovyyyyy,Processor temperatur.,"I have a AcerNitro-5 Laptop i7 8th gen and 1050ti graphics. After an year of buying it i thought of cleaning its fans coz it started to heat up more than usual. I unscrewed the whole laptop and took off the fans which were connected to the cooling rods i cleaned both the the fans and plugged them back in. 
         After that i started noticing a lot more heating in my laptop even in idle state. So the mistake i make was that when i removed the cooling rods, i tampered the heat(thermal) paste. My laptop being a 1000$ product is expected to be equipped with the best thermal paste, at least i hope so. I thought of ordering the arctic silver paste online as i checked everywhere that it's one of the best thermal compounds. But due to this coronavirus lockdown all the deliveries are closed except for essential products. So after doing some research i used the toothpaste in my laptop as thermal paste and its working better😏. At least better than nothing. And it's not causing at heat up in idle state and that ok for coz i dont want to play games on it right now with a good thermal paste so i decided to wait for some time, so i could order(buy) a better product to use as thermal paste. 
         As i was applying toothpaste on my processor and graphics card in my laptop i touched the processor's surface(that shiny little rectangular processor surface) and i burned my finger, caused a sore! I check the temperature of my processor in my laptop's nitrosence software and i showed 50-60 degree Celsius.

How can this be..!! It burned my finger but still how can it be at so low temperature at the same time..??

My wow guild and myself are basically caught up in wow and are running out of stuff to do. We got to discussing garrisons and how they should have been functioning guild halls instead of personal things. Doing quests, mythics, and pvp would unlock all the things you need and want. Stuff like npcs, garrison invasions, customizable guards, building it bigger ans bigger with wins/materials and all that.

I was wondering are there any games that fit this description? It doesnt have to be an rpg or even an mmo. Just something that we can collectively work towards that is permanent game-wise. Even a shooter that we have a guild wins and losses thing.

Thank you all so much in advance!",6,1585576185,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frr4oq/are_there_any_pc_games_that_require_a/,gaming,1

Now she told me that she's ready to play some games. 

She used to play some golf or some easy browser games, just to spend time with me/my brother, so she doesn't have any ""gaming skills"" for playing ""fast""/hard games.

Nintendo has, over time, announced its upcoming games, both big and small- barring the recent Nintendo Direct Mini. So why have Sony stayed so quiet about its upcoming console? All they've shown us so far are the specs, Spiderman load times and the logo.

Even as a PC gamer, it excites me that both the Series X and the PS5 are getting a serious boost in power, and it perplexes me why the company behind the best-selling console of the 8th Generation would keep most of their information about their new console under wraps.",9,1585575809,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frr12v/why_are_sony_staying_so_quiet_about_the_ps5/,gaming,1

I’m looking to upgrade my computer and can’t decide/have absolutely no idea, what to upgrade. Please can you help? 

I was sort of thinking RAM vs GPU

I have an:
Intel i7 7700k
8gb DDR4 2400mhz   (1 Card, mb supports two cards)
Nvidia GTX 1050i 4gb

Budget for upgrades £100-£200 ish 

So, I mostly play TW/Civ/EU4 etc which this runs fine. But I also play GR breakpoint which this can only get to medium w occasional frame rate drops. I also play Fallout 4 &amp; Skyrim. It can handle these ok but I’m looking at really beefing out its ability to handle demanding mods. 

*My most important personnel aim is to be able to play Bannerlord on full everything*

GR Brkpnt has a memory measurement system in the graphics settings. 8gb just isn’t enough so I’m thinking, two 8gb 4400mhz (£100) might do just the trick. What do you think?

Alternatively I hav been looking at the 1060 range, super’s or TIs with 6bg. These seems to be mor around the £250\300 mark. Would rather not spend that much. 

So what do you think? I can’t decide, nor do I know the scale of effect each would have. Please help!!!",5,1585574597,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frqpkr/what_to_upgrade/,gaming,1

frqbe6,Daiquirii222,Guess I'm gonna switch from PC gaming back to PS4,"Have to get it out of my head, so here we go:

So this is basically what I always do but this time I hope it's the last time. 

So I've always been a gamer and most of my life I've been a pc gamer. I switched to console in like 2014 and back to pc on 2017. In October 2018 me and my best buddy sold our PCs because we didn't enjoy gaming as much anymore. We told each other to never make the commitment of buying a 1000€+ PC ever again. So I bought a PS4 pro and was really happy with it. Back in January this year I heard many of my friends were back into pc gaming. So a few weeks and 1400€ later I am back to pc gaming. It's been about 2.5 months now and I already think about selling it again. I should never have made the commitment of spending so much money on a pc and games. When I was on ps4 I spent money on a game and actually played it. Pc gaming makes me buy a game at least once a week and play it for a few hours. Also because I spent so much money I feel like I have to play a few hours a day to not feel like I wasted it.

Don't get me wrong, I love gaming, but it's become so much more of a chore since I own my 1400€ gaming PC. My PS4 was much better for occasional gaming. I don't have the fucking time for gaming 24/7 like my friends to and I want to get into sports again but this fucking rgb glass box on my desk makes me feel like I have to play games all the time. 

I'm a fucking idiot and waaaaaaay too impulsive on buying stuff. It's not only about the money, I feel like I gave up my freedom to decide not to play for a few weeks without having the feeling of having wasted my money. I made a good deal on a used pc so I should be able to resell without too much loss. But it's always a hassle and my girlfriend is gonna think I'm completely lost and can't be helped lol.

Thanks for reading if anyone did, I'd be happy to read about similar experiences.",35,1585573074,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frqbe6/guess_im_gonna_switch_from_pc_gaming_back_to_ps4/,gaming,1

When playing DOOM 2016 which I played on Ultra Violence after completing a difficult fight I felt more accomplished but I don't feel like that in this game.

Maybe you have a good idea for a video game to share with me? Its really sad having all the tools at hand you wanted so desperately as a kid, but now not knowing what to use them for.

Just don't expect anything big or multiplayer.  Also, only platforms available would be android, windows, and PCVR.

frp2g5,Anonymoose758,My thoughts after playing: Undertale,"Disclaimer: This is less gameplay focused and more about my experience playing, but there are still major spoilers ahead. Beware.

How do I start? This game was incredible. I had high hopes going in but it blew even them out the window. Let’s start with the neutral route.

(This was meant to be pacifist on the advice of my friends but I killed Toriel lol)
I fell in love with this game right from the beginning. It was so unique. I laughed at every turn, small jokes such as the “3 out of 4 rocks” or “The pet rock” really enhanced the game because it’s not often anything like that is included in games any more. The annoying dog was one I loved especially, representing Toby Fox. All of the characters had defined personalities and dreams, but there was one which stood out to me. Sans. He didn’t seem to care about much but bad puns. I knew there was more to him that met the eye...
The rest of the run was as great as the start, but without much of a challenge. Some puzzles were a bit baffling at times but the bosses were fun and the music was spot-on. But the end. The “new home” music. The storytelling. It was amazing, and no game has ever made me feel that way. So emotional. Happy, sad, *Determined*. That’s really all I have to say for that.

Now for the pacifist route.
This was definitely much harder than the original, neutral route, although that was really the only difference for most of it, but then I got to the true lab. This was when I knew there was much, *much* more to undertale than what met the eye. This explained how Flowey came into existence, it explained the nature of “Determination” and why monsters could not harness it. But this wasn’t all. Some of the entries were written normally, some were written without capital letters and little punctuation. The way Sans speaks. I left this to be for now because it wasn’t much, but I also noticed that entry 17 was missing, and through the internet I found some thing
Very
Very
Interesting.
It was written in Wing Dings.
On my neutral run, I got a phone call looking for someone who’s name began with G, and I noticed this did not occur on my pacifist run, so I was intrigued. I learned about the hidden character. Gaster. W.D Gaster. 
Wing Din Gaster
Wing Ding Aster
They are both fonts, another thing I noticed on Sans and Papyrus.
I now knew that Sans had written some of the entries, and assuming the others were written by Alphys and entry 17 was written by Gaster, that means Sans and Alphys were probably who Gaster referred to as “You two” in the hidden entry. I believe the determination extractor experiment went wrong, shattering Gaster “across time and space” (I looked into Gaster followers too.) “But it’s rude to talk about someone who’s listening.” I knew Gaster was still around. The phone call and Gaster follower assured me of that. But where? 
But who?
I think Gaster lives on as Papyrus.
Papyrus isn’t as innocent as he seems, he knows about Sans’ control over space-time. Maybe, just maybe, Gaster is not Papyrus, but rather *in* Papyrus. It would explain why they “showed up one day and asserted themselves.” It would explain why Sans is so passionate about Papyrus. It may explain the broken machine in Sans’ workshop. It may have been an attempt to bring Gaster out of Papyrus’ skeleton body, but it failed, pushing Gaster even further from Sans’ reach. Reducing him to the innocent, naive, weak Papyrus. But he is still there, knowing about space time. At least a little.
Maybe it also explains the “Gaster” blasters that Sans uses.
Then there was the Asriel fight and that was mega cool and touching and really epic and lore and stuff. Sans’ judgement was again, amazing. But Sans was still on my mind. He was important, I knew it, yet I didn’t have to fight him. Despite this, he seemed powerful. Phrases like “You’d be dead where you stand” were more than a joke.

And here comes the Genocide route.
Oh boy the Genocide route.
This was my favourite, simply because of how twisted, evil, and most of all, both physically and mentally hard. The voice inside my head. “Where are the knives?” “16 Left.” It was chilling. Then Sans. Warning me. BBBADDD TTOOIIME. I had a feeling about what was to come. I reached Snowdin, once again, it was so weird. The game really reacted to what you did. The shopkeeper asking you to stay away from their family. Stealing G. Now every time I hit something, it hurt more. My favourite, innocent Froggit being brutally murdered by my own hands was actually really sad. This game really played with my emotions. I got to the waterfall and prepared to fight Undyne until she died in one hit, which relieved me. Buuut then Undyne the Undying came along and fucked me over. This is where it got much harder. Seeing her determination to stop me and save others from suffering really put me off, but I beat her after about 3 hours altogether and continued. Past Hotland, to the core. At this point though, I started to change. I thought less about what was happening and just killed whatever I saw. It got easier. And that scared me. I didn’t realise it until I had finished. Now past Flowey and his story (also epic). Now, Sans. The moment of truth. And my theory was right. I immediately saw the threat and went back as far as possible to gather the best healing items, (as well as the “Real knife”. The name change was scary lol) and it took me about 5 hours altogether to beat him. But it was hard. I reflected in my choices. What I had done. I almost gave up. I wasn’t... determined. But I came back, and I won. But at what cost. Watching my favourite character who which I could relate to on personal levels, die after trying so goddamn hard, remembering the other timelines and all the people I had slain. All of his friends. Maybe it drove home crazy idk. But watching him limp off screen, bleeding what I assume is either ketchup, determination or maybe blood (Sans is human UwU?). Then hearing that dust noise when monsters die made it hard to go on. But I did it. I beat the game. I died to Chara. I never went back. Not after that.

But back to his fight for a sec.
There was one line that stood out through it, through his explanation of his struggles to give it his all (Sans suffers many signs of depression), his knowledge of the other timelines and his need for justice, he says “Our reports show massive anomalies in the space time continuum.” Who is he referring to here? Probably none other than Gaster and Alphys from before entry 17, in the true lab. At least that’s what I think.

That’s all, and god did I take too much time to type that.

I saw like, an ad for something called driver booster which was supposed to update ur drivers and stuff to make ur pc faster. I downloaded it and used it. Now, games run even slower, I can't lower the resolution of games and they make a lot more noise. R6, which used to run at 25-30 fps, now won't get past the start loading screen with 0-3 fps. And other games also have a significant decrease in fps.

Did I screw up by using driver booster or do I need to do something else? How do I change the resolution now?

frnxy6,Flameman1234,What games or series have a special importance to you?,"For me, while it isnt my favorite game series, Gravity Rush and it’s sequel are both very important games to me. It was the very last game my mom was able to buy for me on the PSVita, and i’ve held off completing it for so long, just because it would feel like giving up a memory of her that i had held for a while.

Now, three years after her death, i finished both games, and it feels so much different than i expected. Not exactly closure, but just the feeling of opening up to new types of games that i can enjoy in her memory.

If i had to pick another, it would be Kingdom Hearts, which i’ve grown up with all my life, and it brings me back to feeling younger again when i play it. I remember sitting down for hours trying to get to level 99, or beat Sephiroth, and it reminds me of all those classic Disney movies that seem so far away now. It’s more than nostalgia, but it’s almost healing in a way, to revisit those nicer times, and block out the hardships of the world for a couple of hours, even if it is just doing odd side quests or secret bosses. 

I dont think i could give it up if i tried, and i am still just as eager to play my games and discover all the new lore, even if i cant understand a bit of it. While i dont have any friends who liked the series, even just hearing the songs, especially Sanctuary and Simple and Clean almost bring me to tears when i hear them. 

Anyways, do any games spark that same nostalgia in you? Did you have any games that you played with a friend or relative that’s passed or moved away? Any reason is valid to show some love for a series.",0,1585562196,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frnxy6/what_games_or_series_have_a_special_importance_to/,gaming,1

Well from what little I've been able to read about it people seem to be largely under the impression that it will be a port of the most recent pc re-release..

I figured I would point out that this simply is not true, it is being ported by aspyr, this is important because the pc version and the re-release are both lucasarts, so rather than that janky ass mess that currently exists think about what other games they have ported, on ps4 and switch they have jedi knight 1 and 2, and on android they did kotor, all of which are far better and more pollished than their console or pc counterparts.

They run nice, they look nice, and they play nice, and kotor on android is the best way to play it imho because of the touch screen. they are more or less just definitive remasters though and not a full blown remake but still it's definitely not going to be the mess pc version.",0,1585561396,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frnsq2/about_episode_1_racer/,gaming,1

I’m wondering if anyone would have any suggestions for easy shooters to learn on. PUBG was on mouse and keyboard but most my games are on Xbox. I have a few cods, battlefield and a few others.

frnisg,dawn_is_dead,Action RPGS &amp; RPGS Recommendation,"I'm looking for a great RPG to play on either nintendo switch or PS4.

I'm a big fan of the final fantasy genre (I've played FFXIV online, FF12 and FF15).  
I've also played Monster Hunter world on PS4 but I hated it, I didn't like the fighting style and not having a life bar displayed above the monster I'm fighting was infuriating.  
I like open world exploration and I really enjoyed playing diablo 3.  
I have played MMORPGs (like WOW) but I find they're almost too complex and I never get the full value from them.  
I enjoy grinding, simple character customisation (nothing like skyrim pls) and having the ability to cast spells whilst being able to fight with a weapon.

Most important to note is that I can't play games with jumpscares in them  I've had to abandon quite a few games because of this.

frmqje,PlasticHasMemory,Modern Warfare runs worse than before.,"Specs:

GPU: RX 580 8GB (FACTORY)

CPU: FX-8350 (FACTORY)

RAM: 24GB DDR3

So I have run system benchmarks to see if it was a hardware issue, I rank above average on all stress tests. I run the game on everything low except textures which I keep on high. The game runs in fullscreen too!

I played a couple of weeks ago with 80-100 FPS with my settings in standard game modes and was extremely pleased with its performance. But I uninstalled due to it taking too much HDD space. A few days ago I got an EXTERNAL HDD to store my important files (I'm a music production student), and around that time I got a BR itch and wanted to try warzone. I reinstalled the game and was getting 40 fps in Warzone. Sure, it's a BR and it's using more power from my machine to render more things on my screen, so I let it slide and decided that it was too much to ask for 60fps. So I returned to playing quickplay and had \~40 FPS as an average (according to AMD's Adrenalin software). It's confusing to get worse performance on maps where I had averaged 90-100 FPS.

So here's what I've done: 

1. I've uninstalled and reinstalled.
2. Scanned (But never repaired since the scan came clean)
3. Reinstalled shaders because I paused the installation the first time and kept playing so I reinstalled just to be sure. (Also uninstalled the game and reinstalled and waited for shaders to optimize again)
4. Drivers were already up to date but I've checked anyways.

My Radeon Settings are default, and other games run perfectly (R6, CSGO, DayZ, ARMA 3, DMC5)

I know this isn't anywhere near as generous as some people's giveaway's, but I can't do much more out of fear I may not still be employed in a months time. But I want to give something back to a community I've been a long-term lurker on.

I'll give keys to a couple copies of each game to 4 randomly selected people who comment.

If it gets silly popular (which I highly doubt), I'll up the number of copies to give more people a happier start to the week.

Why is that?","Star Fox, as a game about flying spaceships at a thousand miles an hour destroying the enemy, is perhaps better than most current Star Wars games coming out of EA these days. Star Fox might even be better than Rogue Squadron, which says a lot. I just wish we got a dedicated Star Fox game for the Switch, instead of Starlink with some Star Fox content.

F-Zero is a fantastic racing game, but the last one of the series came out all the way back on the Gamecube. It's Nintendo's version of Speed Racer or something. It's a blazing fast anti-grav racer where if you blink, you'll crash. 

Metroid is my favorite out of all of these. It doesn't feel like a furry version of Star Wars, or some old anime. It takes its influence from the original Alien films, but there's far more to it than that. Metroid is one of the few Nintendo titles with its own Manga, and while the story is a little weird it at least sets it apart as something different from its influences. The game essentially created a new genre, Metroidvania, which focuses more on free exploration of mazes instead of left to right platforming. Plus the character wears future football gear.   


These are all great franchises, mostly. It makes me wonder why their sales are poor. Do gamers dislike science fiction?",16,1585550686,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frlvg5/nintendo_has_3_main_scifi_franchises_and_they/,gaming,1

frkh7z,pickled_beans,Mini Review: Skiball for Switch,"Did you need me to tell you this game kind of sucks? Because I apparently needed myself to play it to be sure.

- It's not as bad as you might think it is. For some reason I thought it might be as fun as a bowling game.

- to be fair it is as fun as most bowling games. Which means not really.

- there's a physics-based control mode which I definitely do not recommend. The more analog control is more engaging but then kind of removes the essence of skee ball.

- Graphics are passable, sound sucks.

- there's an odd structure of ticket unlocking with an insane array of balls and lanes I will never play enough to get.

frkff0,PuzzleheadedBee6,"Playing Master Chief Collection, and replaying Combat Evolved has been... well...","I remember playing Combat Evolved on the original XBOX back when I was a little kid. It was one of the highlights for me when it came to getting into video games and the FPS genre. However, after trying to replay it now on PC, since it just released on the MCC, I have to say I'm pretty... underwhelmed. 

I feel like people who genuinely think this is one of the best Halo games in the franchise have to be rather blinded by nostalgia. That's not to say the game doesn't deserve all the praise it does, of course. The game was monumental to showing how great an FPS game can be on consoles. Something that, back in that time, wasn't very common. However, it almost backfired to have 343 give us REACH, a later game in the franchise with more refined combat, mechanics, and variety, first on PC and then follow it up with CE. It is so... slow and ungratifying. That's the only way I can describe the gameplay. The guns don't feel good to use. You're either using weapons, like the assault rifle that has crappy accuracy and poor damage, or something that is actually accurate which pretty much falls down to either using a pistol or a sniper rifle. There's nothing particularly great about any of the weapons and, for a FPS game, that's a HUGE flaw. I see a lot of people criticize how the game has repetitive level design and I'm inclined to agree. 

It bums me out that I'm not in awe with this title as I was back when I was a kid and playing it for the first time. It will always be important to me for that reason. However, it is uncanny af to go from REACH to this.",9,1585543469,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frkff0/playing_master_chief_collection_and_replaying/,gaming,1

frjd3u,nyyfan45,What game should I play?,"Hey all! Firstly I hope all of you are doing well during these tough times. With the spare time now I am looking for a new game that has a compelling story. 

Little background:  
It’s been a long time since I have fully completed a long RPG game. I’d probably have to go back like 3 years ago to when I played FFX. I absolutely fell in love with the story and became obsessed. After that I have had a hard time finding a game to replicate the same feeling ffx gave me. I think the last like story game I have completed was Spider-man back when it first came back since I love Marvel. I usually like light hearted stories and a good romance helps a lot as well. Although, I am willing to play a more serious game if the story is really that good. For gameplay, I am not big into puzzles and having to figure out where to go next. That is actually the reason why I never completed the new star wars game since I was constantly trying to figure out where to go next and having to solve annoying puzzles. 

To sum it up, I would love to find a game with a fun and engaging story that will get me invested into the characters. You know one of those games that hit you in the feels lmfao. Along with that a game that is easy to follow (direction wise) and not having to deal with too many puzzles. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and hope all of you guys are staying safe! I will leave games that I have played down below. Take care! 

Games played: 
Last of us (never completed, hated the gameplay) 
The walking dead (completed, good story. Rather not play a telltale game though) 
Horizon zero dawn (never completed) 
FFX (Amazing 😍)
Spider-man (fantastic)
God of war (never completed, watched story on YT) 
Tales of beseria (good story but god I got lost so many times) 

Hope this helped!",14,1585538687,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frjd3u/what_game_should_i_play/,gaming,1

I’ve never really taken much time to learn much beyond a few trade skills for fun after work, but many games I play as of late are right up my alley but just a little too difficult. I’m not quite in my prime like I used to be and don’t think this is a problem that will get much better. Has anyone else struggled with this? If so, what was your personal solution?

friu96,megzthecat,Is there a game on steam where an IRL couple could have intercourse but on different computers?,"Hi all! Thanks for reading in advance! As we all know the pandemic has put most of the world in quarantine. My boyfriend and I are unable to see each other at the moment because I work in the medical field and do not want to risk passing the virus to my patients. So in short, I know nothing about the gaming world except Minecraft and ESO. Now on to the question, a weird question, does anyone know a game on steam (or that is not sketchy) that me and my boyfriend could play to recreate us copulating lololol. To further elaborate, I would prefer if he and I could be on our own pc, not like in Skyrim where you can just make a character and have intercourse with. I think that would be so fking funny. I’m going insane in quarantine. Thanks!!!!  Also sorry if grammar is off, tired.

fri3rc,Shoritz,[DISCUSSION] Should certain players be able to moderate in games suffering from cheaters?,"for well over a decade, many competitive multiplayer games, mainly those of FPS variety, have been suffering from a growing population of cheaters. 

With more and more games becoming free-to-play to attract players, cheating is becoming rampant as there is virtually no monetary loss to getting an account banned. Cheaters will simply create a new account on their favorite game and continue to wreak havoc.

Developers themselves can only do so much to combat cheating. While their brand-new anti-cheat may seem promising, most cheaters will work their way around it in a matter of days. The developer's main job should be to develop their game.

This brings up the question- should certain, handpicked PLAYERS be able to have the power to combat cheaters? Should trusted players have the ability to kick, suspend, or even ban accounts suspected of cheating? How could it work? How couldn't it work? What tools could they use? Have any games tried this? How would it affect your favorite game? Do you disagree? instead of down-voting, tell us why you think so. I'd love to hear your thoughts!

TL;DR Should handpicked players have the ability to combat cheaters? Why or why not?",1,1585533509,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fri3rc/discussion_should_certain_players_be_able_to/,gaming,1

Kinda stuck and getting annoyed. Lol I just recently bought Acer XFA240 because I’m converting from TV (LG uf6450) just because I feel comfortable and better playing on a monitor.

Here’s my problem. When I connected with the HDMI cable (same one that came with the Xbox One X) I only get 1080P setting on the monitor but I can’t select any refresh rate options. 

Also, with my TV I can’t get any options except 4K UHD but still I can’t select 60/120Hz refresh rates when clicking 1080P on the LG TV.

Am I using the wrong cable or do I have to buy a upgraded HDMI cable. I don’t know if it’s already a 2.0 with the cable that comes with the Xbox.

I was thinking getting DP to HDMI ?
Can I even get 1080p with 120 refresh rate with the Acer XFA240 I purchased ?

frgjsi,Skolary,Video game idea: Super Nintendo rebrandished with online capability,"My idea is quite simple, make a system that exclusively plays SNES style games but instead of split/shared screen, you would be playing the old classics online.  

It would still be using the old controllers and also have a keyboard and headset plug in.  

New games could also be made using the old double/triple digit bit system.  There could even be MMO style games using the old graphic system, which would also be able to have the capacity to hold much larger content. 

**Example:** The game, *Curse of Aros* is a large, multi-bit graphic game that has a ton of content and minimal control usage.  This game would probably be able to be played using an SNES controller

*[I realize you can play these games on new systems as well.  My idea would make it so you would still be using original style controllers with new age integrations]*

I got an xbox a couple years ago but found many of the games that seemed interesting to me were too difficult. I played skyrim and Fallout 4 but used Xbox one mods to cheat on parts that were difficult. My favorite game is Witcher 3 because it allows you to go at your own pace, there isnt reflex based combat (as long as you prepare) and its just cool in general. Ive tried doom 2016 the other night and even on easy settings I got frustrated from dying repeatedly. Which is a shame because usually shooters are the coolest as far as graphics and story. Any recommendations on some beginner/easy scifi or fantasy games good for beginner? I dont mind practicing to get better but some games the learning curve is too steep. I want to get OBSESSED with something.

With the latest, I don't have any issues but with CS I always experienced some fps drops (never understood why) and tbh Overwatch was running smoothly but lately (3-4 day) I've been having SERIOUS fps drops ( to like 6-10) for 5 mins or so and than have it run normally on 70 for 5 mins. And it's killing me. So I've done my research, graphics been set to low etc. than I came across the info that GeForce Experience could serve as solution to my problem, but eversince I've downloaded it had everything it asked for done and now my fps is even worse. What do I do someone please help me.

frfjui,hendersonar,New to this- what should I buy?,"So in high school/college I had a Nintendo Wii and N64 and I loved playing Zelda. It’s the only game I ever played and finished. My husband and I lead pretty busy lives and we’ve been talking about buying a switch since it came out but we’ve never done it because we’re never home. Obviously, we’re home a lot these days. I’ve been trying to find a non price gouged switch but no luck- and we don’t want the lite because we’d like to play together and our toddler will enjoy watching it on the tv. 

My question is- does anyone have any idea where I can get a switch at a reasonable price?  Or, what other games might I enjoy?  I liked the exploration and side quests in Zelda. I don’t like super violent games. I do like post apocalyptic type games though- maybe fallout? I am open to buying another system, I just don’t know where to start! And we’re so, so bored with no end in sight- I’m waiting on a baby to be born in 3 weeks and my husband is a teacher so likely off for the rest of the school year.",7,1585523876,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frfjui/new_to_this_what_should_i_buy/,gaming,0

I don't remember much about it, except for at the end you go to a different dimension and take the battle to these chaos gods or whatever. In the end, you win, but plot twist, the whole thing was a ploy by the god/demon king to die, and by defeating him you become the god/demon king yourself.  The game then starts over at the tutorial in a loop like this. It was a pretty long game, maybe 8-10 hours, and had a decent story to go with the hack-n-slash.

frejjc,goksekor,Game suggestions to reduce my anxiety levels,"Hi guys,

First time posting here. I don't really know why, but my anxiety levels are off the roof lately. I used to be a hard time gamer, but between job and kids, my interest is more into buying games instead of actually playing them for the past couple of years. I am looking for very specific games to help me reduce my anxiety. A lot of games provide a competitive edge, a ""rush"" so to speak and that's what makes them beautiful, I love them for it normally, just not now. So, any ideas for me? If it's a cheap game I can find on PC its added benefit since I have to watch out for every penny spent now. 

Thanks all, stay safe!",21,1585520308,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/frejjc/game_suggestions_to_reduce_my_anxiety_levels/,gaming,2

I’m new to video games and would love some recommendations as to where I should start. I figured quarantine would be the perfect time to get into video games. I’ve never really played them before besides playing Minecraft in middle school and occasionally spending an hour or so playing CoD on my brothers Xbox (and being quite terrible at it might I add). I was really into Minecraft and loved playing with friends but would always play on peaceful because I enjoyed the creative aspect of it but did not enjoying having to deal with the mobs and possibly dying. In every game that I’ve tried, I dislike any sort of combat (I’m bad at it and it stresses me out thinking that there might always be something behind me, and I don’t want to play games that’ll make me stressed or anxious). I think I might enjoy games that include creativity and/or exploring. As a bonus, I’d also love some ideas for co-op games that I could play with my friends.

frdhuc,someguy0118999,Help finding a game for my special needs child.,"*TLDR, my special needs kid wants a game where you just collect things, preferably first person, absolutely no combat and that is a non-negotiable. Like Doom Eternal but without the enemies.*

EDIT: We only have PS4 and PC

Hi everyone. I have a special needs child who has some very, very, **very** specific desires when it comes to video games. She absolutely, under no circumstances, can deal with aggression in games. No combat, no guns, no running from baddies. 

Normally I can find games that work for her, mostly puzzle games (she liked The Witness, even if she couldn't get very far). But she has a new interest: Doom Eternal. Which is weird, I know. She watched me play some of it and really, **really** liked watching me collect items by going back using the fast travel. There were no enemies anywhere, and she really liked watching me find the toys/albums/etc. I went back to Doom 2016 but I had already collected everything in that one and didn't want to restart the game new (I don't have much time to play games, but she does).

Are there any games where you just...y'know...collect hidden things? She likes being able to explore the world, likes first person mostly, and again, can't handle combat (that's not just because she's bad at it, she will lose her mind and I'll spend a night calming her down.)

Preferably a game that has an intriguing story, fun gameplay, and possibly exploration or mystery aspects. While I like the Telltale games and What Remains of Edith Finch, they don’t have fun gameplay in addition to a good story. Also, no Bethesda, AC, or Portal games please.

My favourite games that I have already played are:
- The Witcher 2 and 3
- Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2

Some other games that were very enjoyable are:
- Assassins Creed Odyssey
- Subnautica
- GTA 5
- The Outer Worlds
- Kingdom Come: Deliverance
- Alien Isolation

The current games I was considering playing were the Bioshock series, Mass Effect series, Soma, and Firewatch.

Like, I could see easter-eggs being left in houses with just hundreds of boxes of toilet paper... or going into abandon houses and seeing shelves of expired hand sanitizer.  Or maybe walking into a destroyed city and finding complex remnants of shelters made out of Amazon boxes.

Your character is the chief of a village near the last oasis in a massive desert. You manage and grow your town, make your townsfolk happy by restocking their shops and doing quests for them, and fight monsters and solve puzzles in the desert and its dungeons.

I don't know what happened to make the game release directly after the Switch dropped, but that decision probably prevented it from getting the attention it deserves. I gave it a shot after noticing it while browsing the 3DS shop, and I'm honestly blown away by how good it is.

He bought P5R in his account and I noticed it had a lock symbol, (usually has a countdown) I clicked on it, and it prompted me to buy the game to use it.

I accidentally spilled Monster Energy on my keyboard and I unplugged it almost immediately (~5 seconds). I think that maybe the liquid didn't go into the keyboard in that time. Or at least I hope so.

Now it's unplugged, I cleaned it all up and it's facing down with a towel underneath so all the left liquid can finish leaking.

What's the next step? Leave it drying for a couple of days outside in direct sunlight?

Otherwise I'll have to use a membrane keyboard and I swear to god I hate those things already. Hopefully I don't need to type a lot now, so I can use the keyboard in screen.

Then I also have a couple of additional users for kids on this PS4. They don't have full PSN accounts, but they're added to my family (in PS4 settings). Whenever they try to play GT it asks them to enter email and password. If you don't then the game will constantly complain about it, to the point of being unusable, and it doesn't save progress at all.

Now, this post has gained a lot of speed quickly because it's an opinion that lots of us share. It may not be perfect. However, the developers must hear us out, and we need this to stick. I did not create this post and honestly stand to gain nothing because of it. I am merely here to ask any gamers on all platforms to help this post gain momentum, especially if you've played Warframe before. Lots of us have great memories of a game that genuinely took free to play gameplay seriously. It's got a great community, and well I'd certainly be amiss without it. Our player base is falling gradually, and well this is a plea from just a concerned member. Help us raise this issue with our developers and make them listen. There have been hundreds of thread and posts around the internet, but I post here because, at one point, some of you will have played and stopped playing at some point. I want to help change that and make this community one that will last as the devs put the effort in where we need it most.

fr9e6a,epic312,"I wanted to so badly, but I do not like Jedi Fallen Order","I’m not sure where else to rant about this but I’m a huge Star Wars fan and love the idea behind this game, but it just feels so clunky and unfinished. 

I originally went into this game on one of the harder difficulties thinking I’m a veteran gamer, but I was getting demolished on so many simple battles. I lowered the difficulty and was performing better, but it’s like the game can’t decide between being a button masher and a fighting strategy game. Many different enemies in the game have chain combo moves that can take up a large chunk or all of your health, and to counteract this you have a health (stim) refill button that has this silly 3 second animation in which time you are often killed by the time it’s complete.

I’m sure some will say I just suck and maybe I do, but the way enemies can just continue to combo you, the lack of different attack moves/Jedi powers, and the clunky movements just made this game an overall bad experience. It has the graphics of a great game but plays like a 2003 indie game.

I’m about 6 hours into the gameplay just hoping it’s going to improve but I still feel like I’m playing a beta for an almost complete game. I can go on and on about this tangent but I have to say I’m utterly unimpressed and saddened. I’m going to keep trying to continue on but every-time I encounter another monotonous, poorly created and easily achievable platforming sequence followed by an enemy that strings attacks before I have the chance to dodge, I get discouraged and quit. I load it back up in hopes it’ll get better, but time and time again I’m let down.

For those of you that like it, I’m glad you’re happy. But anyone considering to buy it, I would regret paying more than $20 for this game.",22,1585502283,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fr9e6a/i_wanted_to_so_badly_but_i_do_not_like_jedi/,gaming,3

I am not sure which controller to buy. I will be playing only on PC. I have few options but I need your guys to help me decide which one to get because this is my first controller.

1. Xbox One S controller + Cable for Windows (65 USD) - NEW
2. PS4 Dualshock 4 v2 (45 USD) - NEW
3. Nacon Revolution Pro (60USD) - Used 10 days

Build quality and durability plays big role. I want to have a controller that will serve me long time.

Edit: I see some people argue about why I need controller if I am PC player. Well there are many games on PC that are easier played on controller like FIFA, PES, NBA, Sekiro etc.

How do these games compare to CS:  
**COD Modern Warfare; Rainbow 6 Siege; Battlefield  ... are there any others?** 

Only other games I played competitively were Quake. I've been out of the loop with these for ages. Do people still play Quake? Are there newer popular PC arena style games (e.g., halo, unreal etc)?  I know there are battle royale games that are influenced somewhat. I've played Apex Legends; there's just too much stuff going on for me.

fr8rb5,tardigradesRverycool,PSA: Switch warranties will not be honored if resold,"Do not buy a switch from a 3rd party and or eBay seller unless they’re Nintendo authorized.

I was looking to get one, found out a couple days ago people bought them up and are selling them for crazy profit.

Me and my friends have had switches go bad on us before and we’ve been able to get them replaced because we got them from a first party retailer and or a retailer that has their own warranty (i.e. Gamestop).

Nintendo’s warranty clearly says they don’t cover it.

So if you still want it from eBay / Amazon resellers along with a hefty up charge, require the seller to handle the warranty and get it in writing.

Also I just wouldn’t because I have no idea if something was done to the switches and Nintendo shouldn’t warranty it for that same reason, your sale date isn’t the real sale date and it’s exchanged other hands as well.  Get some RetroPie going :-) There’s PiBoy, GPi, tons of handheld good gaming options.

Anyhow, these accents are all localized with dialogue that seem fitting to where these characters come from. How does this work with the native Japanese dialogue in the game? Do they just choose different Japanese dialects? Do they actually just plan ""This character is from Ireland, he says dialogue that sounds like this, translated to Japan this is what he would say""

I'm really curious how it works considering the dialogue they have definitely match their accents, but if this is a Japanese game where they don't have these specific accents/ways of speaking then how are the characters written initially?",0,1585497439,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fr81bn/japanese_localizations_question_bravely_default_2/,gaming,1
