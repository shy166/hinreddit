fsog5o,IAmReinvented,How to capture clips @ 60fps on Xbox one x no recording software,"Hello. Wrote this on mobile so there might be formatting issues 

So I'm sure lots of people already know this, but there is a way to record games at 60fps on the Xbox one x without having to buy recording software.

I tested modern warfare and ace combat 7 and was able to record at 60fps. Heres what I did..

I think you have to do this every time before you record

‚Ä¢ Navigate to settings &gt; display &gt; video fidelity &gt; switch from.""auto detect"" to ""HDMI""
‚Ä¢ press B once to brings you back to settings &gt; display
‚Ä¢ for display, I switched it to 1080p (1080p tv), and I changed the refresh rate to 120 from 60
‚Ä¢ simply go back to your game and simply record

Note: I have a curved Samsung monitor and it doesn't support 120hz. However, my insignia tv accepted 120hz

Hopefully this is useful and not something everyone already knows",9,1585699152,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fsog5o/how_to_capture_clips_60fps_on_xbox_one_x_no/,xboxone,0

fsniso,IbanezDestroyer,Project Cars 2 is now GWG. Here's some of my tips for eager new drivers to the series,"PC2 has made the game a little more adaptable for controller users. It's not great but, you can make it work with a few hours configuring the controls, that suits you best (yes, HOURS)  I'm a Forza driver, been playing since day one with Forza Motorsport on my old trusty OG xbox (still play it every now and then)  If you are new to sim racing racing, read as many guides that you can.  If you are a little more advanced:

set your dead zones at 0,

steering sensitivity between 30 -50.

Throttle sens: 10

Brake sens: 10

Clutch sens: 10

Speed sens: 80-90

Controller Damping: 70-80

That's my base line.

Also, field of view is important especially for cockpit: 35-40 is a good base.

As far as testing. I use the BMW M1 Procar, It's well balanced and, has a good power to weight ratio.

Track is Watkins, it's an easy track, well designed  and not very technical.

In the beginning, you are going to spend more time adjusting settings than you will driving, but once you get it setup, it's a great game.

Best advice I can give, is get a wheel, even if it's trash.

If not, you're going to spend time in the settings menu.

This is a game is about the best sim experience that you will get on console, it's not for everyone. If you can't perform well, it's ok, try something less technical, Forza series is a great start which I highly recommend.

This game can be overwhelming to new players and even seasoned players alike.

If you have a passion for sim racers, then you will figure it out on you own.

Casuals may need to look elsewhere.

Edit: Best advice I can give to controller users are this: No matter what your settings are, you can't whip your steering back and forth and expect to take a turn, you need to be precise and exact with your steering, not wildly from left to right. Very subtle input is needed, that applies to throttle and braking also.",56,1585695873,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fsniso/project_cars_2_is_now_gwg_heres_some_of_my_tips/,xboxone,10

fsneuq,sllapp,Payment failed,"I was trying to pre-order MW2R and it was being declined. 

I contacted support and the first agent told me that pre-paid visa‚Äôs cannot be used to pre order games (It‚Äôs a debit card btw). I was directed to buy a digital Xbox gift card from the Microsoft store but I get the same error asking me to contact support. Weird because I‚Äôm not ‚Äúpre ordering‚Äù a digital currency that gets emailed to me after payment. So I ended up contacting support again.

Agent 2 was no help at all. I told her what happened with the pre order and the digital gift card. I also asked what criteria a digital card falls under because like earlier, I‚Äôm not ‚Äúpre ordering‚Äù a digital currency. She says the following. ‚ÄúSorry our system doesn‚Äôt take pre paid Visa cards for pre order payment‚Äù. Like did she not read what I just said? I said it was a DEBIT card. Not a pre paid visa. 

Someone please help. I‚Äôve used this card to buy games before but now it doesn‚Äôt work?

Remember, in the discussion threads we ask if you could respect that not everyone will be on the same page in the storylines. We ask if you could use spoiler tags when talking about things happening in the story/game. Don't be that guy, posting intentional spoilers will lead to a ban!.

fsmm88,rainbowsieger,Issues with friends list and recording game clips!,"First of all for the last few days my friends list has been completely inaccurate. It will say I only have 2 friends online or that I have 2 friends total even though I have 500+ friends with 50+ online. It takes minutes or even sometimes hours to update to reflect correctly, but even if it does it's saying they are in different games than they are. Some games they don't even own or have never played. 

Second: I have my game clips settings to record the last 1 minute of play and I take clips pretty often. It has been recording correctly about 2/3 of the time, but the rest of the time it only records 11 or 12 seconds total, or completely wrong portions. 

As an example about the wrong portions part, I recorded a clip after getting a relatively impressive kill in warzone that I wanted to show a friend. Not only did it record 11 seconds instead of 1 full minute completely destroying the clip...but it recorded 11 seconds of about 15 minutes prior of me just sitting in the menu before I even started a game.

fsmi3j,pythonInRelay,"We NEED a file integrity/verification option. Having to fully redownload a 100GB game due to a single 'bad block', is ridiculous.","Over the last few days I've downloaded a fair few new games onto One X. Roughly 20% have had file integrity errors of some sort (Bad Block error). Where the only solution is to redownload the ENTIRE game again. My connection is really stable and my console is pretty new too so it shouldn't be a bad hard-drive either. I only get this issue with downloaded games and only those that are bigger than about 60GB because they take a while to download.

For a title like Quantum Break (amazing game btw) which is 100-150GB (no joke). It's a total nightmare even on a good connection.

Steam has offered basic checksum/file integrity checking for years. On Steam you can verify file integrity and just redownload the parts that don't pass verification, in an instant. Why don't we have this on Xbox, especially when so many titles are over 30GB?

Integrity checking, even the basic md5 kind would not only save people so much time and bandwidth, it would also save Microsoft's download servers a LOT of traffic and work. The option for a full uninstall/reinstall could still remain, but md5/checksum verification and integrity checking should still be a possibility for any downloadable games and content.

Please get this done. Not having this option and forcing an entire full uninstall/re-install is madness. If it can't be put in a future update for Xbox One. Please do it for the Series X.",23,1585692523,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fsmi3j/we_need_a_file_integrityverification_option/,xboxone,0

It says ""TV Signal was lost"" and an image telling me to plug in my cable provider TV signal.  I have to dismiss it with ""B"" to get to the xbox home page.  

I don't have a TV service.  I never have.  I remember when I first got my original Xbox 1 this issue would happen.  Then after some time (a couple years ago), the problem disappeared.  On boot the XBox would go straight to the Home Screen. 

A couple months ago, it started happening again.  (Maybe... ~4-6 months ago)

Any idea if this is something they're aware of, or how to report it?  I'm on the insider program (but I don't think any rings).

I didn't bother with it at the time but with isolation and lock downs taking place I thought this might be the time to look into it haha. Anyhow, I took off the face plate and while playing with  the face plate off the character can engage in the sprint. As soon as I put the faceplate back on, it does not work. I'm wondering if anyone might have an idea as to why this is. The controller I have is a PDP faceoff and I've had it for about 2-3 years now.

fsgx0f,concretebox,Best player-service features Microsoft will never add to XBOX,"In response to all the hype about teraflops and the shape of the next box, I'd like to start a discussion on all the things Microsoft has failed to deliver, features wanted but never addressed. My top requested features are: 

1. Bring back custom music playlists. The OG Xbox had this feature. Since then streaming has replaced CDs. They could do this 13 years ago, why can't they now? 
2. A more accessible controller. It's the same as the last one, which was the same as the last two. OK, sure it's \*slightly\* different, but no innovation since they added vibration. An innovation I'd like to see is the ability for the controller to split into two pieces. This would allow a lot more folks to be able to game on Xbox. A third party solution won't work, you need the accessiblity device in the box that is shipped with every xbox. If they don't devs won't build for it. 
3. PC-style console to modify the game for ""fuck this bullshit"" sections of video games. Every game has it. Think of the dozens/hundreds of games you quit because of some bullshit. Maybe you only played 1% of the game, but you paid for 100% of it. ""You can't make this jump on level two, well fuck you, I've already got your $60.""",16,1585674966,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fsgx0f/best_playerservice_features_microsoft_will_never/,xboxone,0

There is a myriad of reasons as to why gamers would want to disable cross-play so I was happy to see we had the option. 

I myself didn‚Äôt know this was possible until yesterday after, u/Dkroegs2019, posted the information on the CODWarzone Reddit, and I thought this info could be equally beneficial here. Here are his directions:

1. Go to your xbox settings.
2. Scroll to account and click on privacy and online safety
3. Click on xbox live privacy
4. Click on view details and customize
5. Click on communications and multiplayer
6. Change ""you can play with people outside of xbox live"" to block.

Was looking at the upcoming releases for the next few months and I just realized how... empty the Spring/Summer is going to be. Yes, we‚Äôre reaching the end of this gen but it‚Äôs still pretty jarring:

-	RE3 on April 3. 
-	Maneater (hardly an exciting one) and Minecraft Dungeons at the end of May. 
-	and NOTHING until Wasteland 3 at the end of August. 

So starting from RE3 at the beginning of April, the next AAA release is Avengers, at the beginning of September. **Five** **months** without a major release is **bad**, whichever way we look at it. 

And I don‚Äôt mean to start a fanboy war, but in this 5-month period, PS4 is getting FF7 Remake, Predators Hunting Ground (meh), TLOU Part II and Ghost of Tsushima as exclusives...

There is a problem with my Xbox One Power Brick that when I plug the cable in the console the Power Brick led turns off and the console doesn't turn on. I've researched this problem and there is no solution but buying another Power Brick.  


Thing is thar Microsoft discontinued the production of my Xbox. So I have to buy a Power Brick that is not original. That's okay.  


Question is: I cannot find a Power Brick thar matches exactly the specs for amperage. My broken Power Brick says Input 100-240v~4.91A, 50/60Hz Output 12v_17.9A, 5Vsb_1.0A. The Power Bricks I find says almost the same thing, but the amperage for Input is 2A, 47~63Hz and Output 13,34A. The potency of this one I'll thinking to by is 165W and I don't know the potency of the original one. 


Is it okay to buy this one with this little differences? I'm a complete negation when it's about these thing of power like amperage and stuff.",0,1585665996,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fse5y7/question_about_power_brick_power_supply/,xboxone,2

fsdwdk,cjeagle,"Microsoft Rumored to be Buying IP's for Silent Hill, Metal Gear and Castlevania","   
""Tonight between 10PM and Midnight (est) Microsoft will finalize the purchase of the entire gaming catalogue from Konami.  


The  deal they've been working towards is so expensive for Microsoft that it  will single handed fund a new manufacturing facility Konami has been  wanting build to focus on new R&amp;D for gambling devices.  


Microsoft  will have to keep paying royalties back to Konami on all games that  Konami originally released, including future remasters. Only new games,  made from the ground up, will be fully profitable for Microsoft. Konami  will also retain the rights to create new gambling hardware based on any  previously adult (M-rated) themed game they've released.  


In the  deal Microsoft will be able to select a team from potential layoff  employees after the sale to help found a studio in Chou City. Konami  will allow for the current ""Xbox Games Studios Tokyo"" as a satellite  office for 12-18 months on the second floor of their current  headquarters in Chou City while Microsoft finalizes their plans to move  to, or construct, their own studio space.""  


[https://pastebin.com/B5G7LRN5](https://pastebin.com/B5G7LRN5) 

Some websites have picked up on the rumor.

[https://gamerant.com/rumor-microsoft-buying-silent-hill-metal-gear-castlevania-konami/](https://gamerant.com/rumor-microsoft-buying-silent-hill-metal-gear-castlevania-konami/)

 It is still a rumor at this stage(Pastebin document also alleges that  this agreement was supposed to be revealed at E3 before that event was  cancelled) but it does make sense for MS to do so since they have been  actively looking to acquire either an established studio or start a new  one in Asia specifically in Japan. Financially they have the wherewithal  to outbid Sony on those IPs.   


One of the Xbox execs even hinted  during the GDC streaming that XGS has 16 studios, although MS later said  that Kevin Gamill, the General Manager of Game Developer Experiences  for Xbox misspoke and that for now they only have 15 studios so maybe it  hasn't been finalized or ready to revealed yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I also read that Gamepass is also going to be offered in Japan soon as  Microsoft tries gain a foothold in the Japanese gaming market.

1. Go to your xbox settings.
2. Scroll to account and click on privacy and online safety
3. Click on xbox live privacy
4. Click on view details and customize
5. Click on communications and multiplayer
6. Change ""you can play with people outside of xbox live"" to block.

I myself didn‚Äôt know this was an option until yesterday,

fsbur0,Kuritos,"Xbox ultimate just expired, and now I'm unable to play my disc game, which happens to be available on game pass","I noticed when I first tried ultimate, I was playing my already owned games with [GAME PASS] in the bottom right corner. I didn't mind it, as it made sense I was subscribed, and owning the game at the same time.

I didn't like the full price of ultimate, and I switched back. When I bought a year of regular xbox gold, I noticed it would turn 12 months *gold* to only 4 months of *ultimate.* 

I waited for ultimate to expire on its own, and then I applied the digital code I bought for the 12 months gold. It works just fine my other digitally owned games that were on gamepass, but this disc game is purely ignoring the disc. It's a big game too, so I don't want to reinstall it, if anyone has a work around.",3,1585656838,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fsbur0/xbox_ultimate_just_expired_and_now_im_unable_to/,xboxone,1

I don‚Äôt really know anything about gaming, but I do love both robots and cheesy writing, so I was hype to see Detroit: Become Human come out for pc. I only have an xbox one, so I hadn‚Äôt been able to play it before. unfortunately, I‚Äôve never invested in a gaming computer and don‚Äôt really understand anything about specs so, like an idiot, I bought the game and discovered it‚Äôs incompatible with my graphics card. I didn‚Äôt expect it to run very well, but since I rarely have issues with games, I thought it might run like... at all. 

in a disappointed haze I was googling around and came across a couple articles about ‚Äúplaying pc games on xbox one‚Äù. it looks like they‚Äôre actually talking about an app (Wireless Display) that streams from your pc to your tv, which sounds like it would still just rely on the specs of my bad laptop. but I was curious, since it also seems like you control the game from the xbox, not the computer‚Äî

if my computer doesn‚Äôt have the graphical power to run this game, but my xbox (theoretically) does, would controlling and viewing the game through my tv/xbox make it playable? how much of the process of actually running the game would my computer be diverting to the xbox as opposed to itself? ü§î

fs5tjy,TheAmazingDisgrace,Microsoft should start Series X Pre-Orders early....here‚Äôs why.,"Microsoft needs to take advantage of the Government stimulus checks coming in and start preorders early. 

I would put part of my $1200 towards a new Xbox. It would probably give Xbox an advantage over Sony in initial sales too. My point is people will be a lot likely to spend ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äôs‚Äù money on a new console than their own and Microsoft should recognize that. Extending on this point:

1) I understand that checks will be needed by some to pay for basic needs in these hard times, and that‚Äôs ok, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs just as many people that will go out (or stay in) and spend it in days. For those people, I feel like the Series X would be very enticing to preorder since they now have extra cash and it will be very chaotic if the Xbox does end up releasing Thanksgiving with all the other Black Friday stuff going on. 

2) This might entice PlayStation to follow suit, which would mean that we might get more info out of them sooner. Xbox for life, but I‚Äôm still curious about the next gen PS5. 

3) Microsoft will get a sales edge over Sony initially and this should be good press for them. A lot of people are bored and stuck at home now so it will get a lot of attention and will give people something to look forward to in these trying times.

fs4r99,FlamboyantMussolini,Xbox One headset problem,"Recently I got a Logitech G935 headset to use for my consoles. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I plugged it into my PS4 and it worked like a charm, exceptional sound quality and the microphone worked amazingly. But skip ahead to the Xbox, of course the USB doesn't work.  Today I went out and bought an Aux cord to use for my headphones, and naturally it wouldn't work. At all

&amp;#x200B;

There was no sound or output coming from the headset, so I reset the Xbox a few times and it started working, but there was still a major problem. The microphone would NOT work, at all. I tried testing it in CoD, nothing, a party, nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, Xbox does realize that there is a microphone because if you wiggle the Auxcord then it will make a static-esq noise but nothing more. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

fs4nkc,AppleGenius115,Can an opened Xbox still be serviced?,"So one of my Xboxes (X) decided to stop powering on all of a sudden. I decided to open it up to see if anything somehow became disconnected and everything looks fine and connected with no problems, so I think there‚Äôs a short on my motherboard somewhere. I didn‚Äôt replace any parts or have a third party repair shop work on it. All I did was open it myself and it‚Äôs back together exactly as it was. My question is, will Microsoft will service it even though it has been opened? I heard that about two years ago there was a case between the FTC and Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo about their warranty terms where if no damage was done by the user opening it, nothing was replaced by a third party, no new parts were added from other consoles, and nothing was damaged by the user from opening it, it could still be serviced.

fs20gg,TroyA7X85,Xbox One X and Elite Series 2 broke within 3 days of each other (Rant),"Back in July of 18 I bought my One X and a 4K monitor as a going away present to myself, as I was going to college for the first time. Played tons of great games on it, and it worked like a charm. 3 days ago, I was playing Warzone with my buddies and in a split second I went from playing with them to my One X telling me that all of the data on my hard drive was corrupted. 

The next day it was saying the same thing, so I did a factory reset. This led to all kinds of startup errors. I followed the steps on the support site for the errors and got nowhere. I knew it was fried, and spent 2 hours on the phone with support to troubleshoot it, and found out that it was out of warranty by less than a year. Bit the bullet and ordered an One S Disk Free on Amazon because it was cheap and the gaming continued.

Last night I noticed that my Elite 2, that I got for my birthday in January, was registering false right trigger presses and double right bumper presses. I've seen the posts on here seeing that trigger issues with the Elite 2 are, unfortunately, common and that they generally replace them no questions asked. Spent an hour on the phone with 2 different support agents for them to tell me that my warranty was up on the 20th of this month. 

The supervisor I spoke with was unsympathetic about my situation and told me that both of these breaking were just the ""nature of electronics"" and  told me to pay $250 to fix my One X and $100 to fix my Elite 2. He was also adamant that there was no one else higher than him that I could talk to.

Has anyone had any similar experiences with their One X or Elite 2 doing similar things? How did you fix them? Is Xbox Support always this awful?",2,1585611738,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fs20gg/xbox_one_x_and_elite_series_2_broke_within_3_days/,xboxone,1

fs1a9t,The_Roptor,[HELP REQUEST] Halo 3 MCC in game recording does not save clips? Where to find in game recordings?," *Mods, if this is the wrong sub for this post, apologies, I also posted this on the Halo sub.*

I have a great clip that I wanted to record and share but need help to hopefully get the in game recording. I used the in game options in *Theater* to record the clip in Halo 3 MCC, but whenever I ended the recording (not using the Xbox One recording since that was capped at 2 minutes) it did not save anywhere that I can find it sadly. When I left the theater film of the game, the game was lost from my recent history since it was the final game in my temporary history and it was replaced by a newer game :(.

The clip was from this weekend and was a Warthog gunner 20 kill streak in Team Slayer on *Standoff*. I got in the Hog with another player on my team after debating if it was a good call, and it was a great choice. My teammate drove amazingly and I shot up Blue Team like they were a pi√±ata, and there were some hilarious and epic kills (*Running Riot* on a partially active camouflaged enemy while the Hog was back-flipped). We were unstoppable, but then my driver drove us off the one cliff on the map and we fell to our deaths, it was glorious and hilarious. After the game, the driver simply messaged me ""Ma boy"", and no other words were needed.

If anyone can help me figure out how to hopefully find the clip, I would really appreciate it so that others can enjoy it too!",0,1585609079,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fs1a9t/help_request_halo_3_mcc_in_game_recording_does/,xboxone,1

I pay for 100gb speeds and have already spoken with the provider and its not an issue on their end. I have tried resetting modem, router and console, plus tried wired and wireless connection. Still no change, getting an avg speed of 10g vs the normal 70-80 I normally see when updating. Now this has been going on the past 3 days, this morning I boot up the console in the bedroom and start the same update on that console, it blast thru the update at speeds of 70-80. So i try the game room console again...still slow. So I am left to think it has to be the console itself, its only a little over a year old so I am not sure what could be going on.

Did I miss something important? Like an update or something? I just moved house a week ago and only got internet on it today. Or is it possible it got damaged in the move so that it doesn't read discs anymore except dvds?

Thanks in advance for any help",2,1585596437,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/frxe25/help_with_my_xbox/,xboxone,1

at the ripe old ages of 29, my SO and I have purchased our first ever console - an Xbox One S. In these times, we're surely not the only ones seeking refuge in your community.

After the initial excitement, we're suddenly faced with a tough realization - there are 100s upon 100s of games and reading/watching reviews isn't that helpful when you've no idea what you're looking for. Or rather the fear is that an enticing story will turn into frustration due to overly difficult mechanics. So we could really use your help. 

Here's the thing - total newbs, not interested in online play, no friends that play, just want to have some fun both together and separately. Where do we start?

Any and all recommendations welcome (co-op &amp; not). And if you tell me I have to play Witcher 3... I will. 

Also, if there's anything you wish you knew ahead of time when you got your first console - would love to hear it.

The result of this is that we pay $60 for a port that looks pretty, but performs extremely terrible and I'm sick of seeing this pattern from different companies. call of duty modern warfare 2019 another great game that could've perform alot better if the resolution would've been dropped a little we would've been fine and we would've been hitting a smooth 60fps while still have a nice crip image, but again same story so you must be thinking to yourself ""why does this matter?"" well the reason is simple if they're already doing this on Xbox One X what about when we move on Xbox series X? History will repeat itself now I'm not a fan of console wars, but clearly these companies put more effort into their games on PS4 Pro. I'm not sure why companies do this are they just assuming we're all a bunch of resolution meat heads or are they just being lazy, maybe they don't care about xbox users?

If only there was a rotating library of video games that everyone had access to... Then it hit me that Game Pass is perfect for this.

fruh85,Funkyokra,"Game started me over, all progress lost, please help!"," Hey y'all, I hope that maybe y'all can help this fairly new Xbox One user. We have two xbox accounts that have used this console. I have been playing FarCry 5 on one of those accounts and I have completed John's region and am mud deep in Faith's. Today, I accidently picked up the console that we don't usually use, and it started the game from the beginning. Figuring it might think that I am the other account, I turned off the console and in about 20 minutes I started it with the usual console. I made sure I am in the correct profile and everything, but the game started over again. The Xbox shows all my achievements and stuff, so it knows that I have been playing. I have switched in and out of each profile, but the game doesn't change. I feel sick that all my progress might be lost. I dunno if this is a Far Cry problem or Xbox, but if anyone can help, I would appreciate it. I have looked on Xbox support but this issues doesn't seem to be addressed. I'd appreciate any help, even if you are just directing me on where to find it. Fairly new to gaming, so assume that I am an idiot.

frtwsu,iamthabeska,Headset Issues,"Hello,

So my xbox is about 2 years old and never used a headset on it. The other week I picked up some crappy ones from Argos and plugged them in, straight away the sound and mic worked. About a week later the sound worked but the mic stopped. For some reason I did a reset of the xbox and it worked again once or twice with the mic.

I then brought another headset and again it worked for a few days then stopped but the sound continued. I then got a new controller, plugged headset in, it worked once with the mic then nothing.

Splashed a bit more money this time and got the Hyper X headset. Slightly different this time, mic didn't work the first time but sound works all the time.

Ive tested all the headsets on my phone and laptop and they work with sound and record no issues, everytime.

I ended up yet again resetting the console and again it worked the first time then stopped. I've checked all the stupid things, mic is not muted etc on headset.

I'm either doing something really stupid or I need to change a setting somewhere, but it's really doing my nut in.

Any thoughts?",2,1585585544,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/frtwsu/headset_issues/,xboxone,1

I always sort of viewed my gaming setup as a little nest egg, if we ever have an expensive bill or something, I could sell it and get a decent chunk of change, and I quickly learning that having a baby is super expensive so that's exactly what I did, sold the whole set up. 

Well my wife could tell that I miss gaming, it's been apart of my life since I was a kid and would one day hope to bring that same joy to my son .

Well, I was sitting there playing bf5 and the tv switched to HDR mode, then right back to game mode, this happened multiple times until it popped up ""no signal"". I have tried other hdmi ports on the same tv (nothing) switched the hdmi around (nothing) used a different hdmi cable (nothing) used the same and different hdmi cable on another TV and all of its hdmi ports (nothing) but I used the same hdmi cable and the same hdmi port on the same lg tv I was using with my 360 and it showed a picture. So I know it's the one x, and I'm assuming it's either the hdmi port on the xbox itself (which has no visible damage whatsoever) or the retimer chip. Has anyone had that mode switching then no signal and if so what was broken?",1,1585576246,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/frr5a0/one_x_crapped_out_on_me_who_knows_about_repairing/,xboxone,1

If they named it Xbox Series 5, or something completely unique like Xbox Infinity (like the old rumored name for Xbox One), we might not have this problem. Sure, there would be questions about the name, but you wouldn't mistake it for any other Xbox system

I feel like this simplicity would have been a big win for the new Xbox.

frlyl6,Based_danNY37,Possible Game Sharing Finesse with Friends?,"With being in quarantine my friends and I have finally been playing some games together after years apart. Fortnite mostly due to cross platform.

But after briefly reading about Game Sharing I'm quite intrigued!

What I know is, if I log into my friends account on MY CONSOLE, say it's gamertag PURPLEBALL1, I will then be able to install his games on my CONSOLE. However I will only be able to play those games while logged into his account. I will not be able to play them with any other account on my same CONSOLE. Correct?

But then, when I'm playing his games on my CONSOLE using his account, he is then now NOT ABLE to play or even Log into PURPLEBALL1 anymore on HIS CONSOLE. I'm guessing when he does log in, it will automatically kick me out on MY CONSOLE?

But then if he has 3 accounts signed in normally on his CONSOLE, they already get access to his library. Are those other accounts also locked out of his games while his account is being used by me in MY CONSOLE? Or can he use one of those accounts that belong to his sibling to play the games while still aloowing me on MY CONSOLE to be logged into PURPLEBALL1 playing his library?

frj76h,X_Kalomn,I hope next gen game DVR can record different audio channels separately.,"Most games have separate audio channels for different sounds like voices, music, footsteps, sound effects, etc. To experience most games fully, you'll want to have all of these enabled. But to get footage for say, a montage, without losing sound effects and voices, you'll have to play through large portions of a game with the music turned all the way off so it won't conflict with whatever music you're going to overlay onto your clips. 

If Xbox Game DVR were capable of recording each or most of these streams separately, then allow you to go into the clip and disable whatever channel you don't want to hear, it would allow content creators play through games more enjoyably and still have fully usable clips.

I imagine MS could put on whatever restrictions they need to comply with publishers (like not allowing ONLY the music to be turned on in some games) but on a game by game basis, this would be one of the greatest quality of life bonuses for someone like me.",0,1585537985,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/frj76h/i_hope_next_gen_game_dvr_can_record_different/,xboxone,1

Kinda stuck and getting annoyed. Lol
I just recently bought Acer XFA240 because I‚Äôm converting from TV (LG uf6450) just because I feel comfortable and better playing on a monitor. 

Here‚Äôs my problem. When I connected with the HDMI cable (same one that came with the Xbox One X) I only get 1080P setting but I can‚Äôt select any refresh rate options. 
Also, with my TV I can‚Äôt get any options except 4K UHD but still I can select 60/120Hz when clicking 1080P on the LG TV. 

Am I using the wrong cable or do I have to buy a upgraded HDMI cable. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs already a 2.0 with the cable that comes with the Xbox. 

I was thinking getting DP to HDMI ?

I know we‚Äôve had communication suggesting all accessories will be back compat, but there‚Äôs been no suggestion as to whether we‚Äôll be able to use USB audio devices this time round.

In the past few days I've been experiencing some strange behavior from my One X.

When I go to download an app like Netflix or YouTube, the download speed varies between 20-500kbps while speedtest.net and the Xbox speed test puts my internet at about 40mbps. I've checked Xbox services and everything is up.

I tried to factory reset and it didn't fix the issue, also did a factory reset to my modem/router TP-LINK VR600.

Also lately YouTube keeps disconnecting from my user and it's been a huge annoyance.

My Xbox is less than two years old but is out or warranty, I'm leaning towards this being a HDD issue but was unable to find anything online to back this up.

frbujc,YakubCZE,Xbox ONE as media center,"Lately I‚Äôve been thinking about using my Xbox one S as media centre for my TV. For a long time I have been using Plex occasionally on it and I have nothing bad to say about it. All my files are on a Plex media server and now I‚Äôm about to try to get a dvb-t signal to it using my raspberry pi (which is also my Plex server) either with Plex pass and its live TV and DVR function , or maybe using Kodi. Haven‚Äôt decided on that one yet.

However, the point of my post is to ask, if it would be a good idea to use it as a main tv centre (or maybe you could say set-top box) or if it would be better to use something like another raspberry or firestick or something like that.  The main concern I have is that the Xbox would be running everyday for about 4-5 hours, which seems like it could shorten the lifespan of it. Also the fan could become irritating after a while.

frav5e,Armadillllllllo,Xbox Games with Gold and GamePass games availability issue,"Hi,

I'm sure this has been posted many times, but I felt that some light should be shed again on this issue:

How come that you can't purchase X360 games on Xbox One outside US (or in other regions)?

First, things to consider: This is from an account outside US, but with GamePass and GwG subscriptions which work fine with Xbox One games. Also, all (backward compatible etc.) games from GamePass can be installed.

But, original Xbox and X360 games can't be purchased or downloaded with or without GwG subscription. 

Error I get is either ""Request timeout"" or ""Offer not valid in your region"". I understand that. But how can I then download games from GamePass? Any game, original Xbox, Xbox 360 or Xbox one.

Based on forums, some reddit threads etc., issue is that Xbox 360 marketplace is technically different than Microsoft store now. 

Shouldn't this whole ""X360 marketplace was different back then"" issue be reworked if MS plans to sell us Backward compatibility feature?",1,1585507480,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/frav5e/xbox_games_with_gold_and_gamepass_games/,xboxone,0

fr6atv,BobLbLawsLawBlg,Two Xbox One Systems in One House Device Steaming - Quarantine Help Please,"My Fianc√© and I have lived together for a while now and she has never shown an interest in Gaming. Now that are in quarantine and there is little to kill time she likes to kill time playing Sims 4. I have EA Access so she is able to play it out of the vault. 

This was all cute and fun during the week while I was working, but now on the weekend we find ourselves in a spot of trouble. 

*Details:*
We have two (2) Xbox systems. One in the living room, the other in the bedroom. 

I also have the OneCast iOS App. 

Lastly she has an account but it‚Äôs like a child account under my main account. 

*Objective:*
We want to Stream Sims 4 from the Bedroom XBox to her iPad using the OneCast App so she can play in the living room while we watch TV together in the Living Room and I play on a separate TV. 

*Current Issues:*
Since hers is a provisional account, I can only connect to the OneCast App using my Account. Once the stream starts I can log into her account, but when I sign into my account in the living room the stream is killed since I‚Äôm logged out of the bedroom (can only be logged into one Xbox at a time).  

So I ask you all, how the hell can I do this?

Is the cheapest way to get her a real account, game share and then eat the cost of a separate Gold Account so she can get online and play?

Are there other options / solutions?",6,1585490467,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fr6atv/two_xbox_one_systems_in_one_house_device_steaming/,xboxone,1

Sorry I have to create a topic for this, I wasn't able to find definitive info just by googling it...

I am considering buying a XBOX One X in the next few days; however, the only monitor I could use it on for a good while would be this [1080p Philips curved LCD monitor](https://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/278E8QJAB_00/curved-lcd-monitor-with-ultra-wide-color#see-all-benefits).

Here are its specs:

fr3gdt,HearTodayGunTomorrow,Xbox Live Account hacked but still logged in via Xbox App,"I was gullible enough to fall for a Microsoft Authenticator trick, wherein the person promised to help me in a game through admittedly shady means, but needed my email.  Me, not thinking that my account could be compromised by giving out my email alone, seeing as I have 2FA, obliged.  


Well, I clicked the number code they sent me and my phone starts buzzing about how all my info is being updated, I quickly try and change my passwords but they beat me to it.  I know, I'm an idiot.  


Obviously locked my bank account attached and contacted some people on Microsoft's website, but got nowhere.  Somehow, my existing Microsoft account no longer exists, isn't recognized as ever existing, the email is not attached to anything, yet it claims it's in use.  Go figure.    


The thing is, I'm still logged on via my Xbox App and even messaged the user, telling them what I was seeing, they changed my email, they say ""oh well"" I mean, it's a wonder they even took a break from netflix to respond.    


So my app still controls my xbox, is still logged into my account, is still able to send messages etc... I'm wondering if there's any way I can use this to log in before I go the route of contacting Microsoft?  Are there any account customization options that I'm not seeing on the app?  


When I press the home button and go to sign in, my Gamertag displays my old email, but when I select it, it wants me to sign in with the new email.  It's strange that it still displays this seeing as Microsoft refuses to acknowledge its existence through normal login means.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'll call support when they open the phone lines.  Assuming I have debit card numbers, past emails, passwords, I'm signed in on the app, and I believe am/was signed in on my brother's Xbox I think I'll have a chance.  I've been recently signed in on 3 different Xbox One consoles I have access to, as well as a 360, is there a chance I haven't been logged off on them?

fr2xie,CrazyUncleCrispy,here is why the xbox series x having no exclusives is bad for microsoft,"ok let me say this first im looking at this from a business perspective as this move is pretty pro-consumer but it aint a very smart business move and im not a huge fan of xbox though i dont hate it their games just arnt my cup of tea.

exclusives sell consoles as they are the only reason to buy 1 console or the other and the fact that the series X's exclusives will be playable on PC and xbone is bad.  theres 0 incentive to buy a series X over a PS5 or a switch. having all your  exclusives being made multiplatform is a bad business move as it makes people realize its better to just not buy the console as the games are available else where. will you sell more games? sure but you arnt gonna sell many consoles and thats where the big money is.

now heres how to do this in a good way from a business perspective. keep  the flagship titles (such as halo and gears) as exclusives to the series X but have the other exclusives be timed on the series x then release on the xbone and pc.",0,1585472141,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fr2xie/here_is_why_the_xbox_series_x_having_no/,xboxone,1

Feel free to chime in with any game I missed and I'll edit the post. I might also categorize them by Kinect feature used, but for now having all of them in one place would be a good start.

fqyi8d,theone_2099,Help! Xbox One with no video - reset display doesn't work,"TL;DR: Xbox One in a state where it doesn't emit any HDMI, but it worked earlier today.

Hi, I borrowed my neighbor's Xbox One. He hasn't booted it up in at least two years. I plugged it in, saw it, and wanted to connect to Xbox Live and needed an update. So I started an update. At some point during the update (maybe at 3%), it seemed to go back to settings. Maybe one of my kids hit a controller. No worries. I shut down the xbox (hard shutdown), and tried booting it up again.  Starting from this point, the Xbox doesn't emit any video - TV says no signal.

1. The disc player works, I was able to insert and eject an xbox 360 disc.
2. I tried resetting the display by holding eject and power at the same time - still no go.
3. When I plug in a controller via micro-USB, the controller vibrates.  When I hit the Xbox button on the controller, it just blinks.

Haven't gone down the route of trying a USB factory reset, that's kind of a last resort since it's my neighbor's Xbox.

What are your guys thoughts on the upgrade ? I have more than enough money to buy the headset so the price factor don't affect me.

 Is windows sonic sound so much better?

I think I have exhausted every option, here are some of the steps I have taken in the order they were performed:

&amp;#x200B;

Removed profile, and downloaded profile again

Removed Forza 5 and downloaded again

Factory reset cosole

Tried multiple controllers and headsets all are known to be good and function normally with party chat

Downloaded to a new XBOX One X

Played with some audio settings and defaulted them - every other game chat audio works fine but not Forza 5

Still no chat audio, game music and menu sounds are fine.

Changed profile settings so there are no restrictions.

Changed / defaulted controller audio setting slider from controller to headset.

Any Suggestions? I just like this game better than Forza 7 or Horizon 4 so lookin' for a fix.

fqpiwt,RandallMcMurphy,Xbox Live Account Deleted by Microsoft -- Support Dead End -- Any Paths Forward?,"Hi Team, I am typing up my problem here as I have hit a brick wall with Microsoft support where they have effectively told me to stop calling. A bit of a long story...

I created my Xbox Live account approx. 10 years ago, foolishly using my university email address. I obviously no longer have access to that email account, but this hasn't been an issue as I have been able to add a secondary personal email to the gamertag. With quarantine going on, I had some free time, so I stupidly decided to look into making my personal email account primary, permanently removing the .edu email from the xbox live account.

As some of you may know this requires you logging into your account and swapping the aliases, which I was having trouble doing because the personal email was already associated with the account. I thought that Microsoft support would be able to work some magic on the back end to help me with the issue, so I reached out via the support chat and a tech walked me through a few steps that involved me creating a new gmail account to make the new primary alias (to remove the .edu), then a secondary step making my actual personal email the primary (I don't know why this was the path, but I followed along). As soon as I entered the newly created gmail account as the primary alias, I was logged out of the account with an error and no matter what email address I typed in, I received ""That account doesn't exist, please login with another account or create one""

What has ensued is a week long fiasco where I have spent 7+ hours either in chat windows or on the phone. I have been told multiple things: there is an account associated with that email so the error is weird (they send security code which I receive but I still can't log in), that the birth dates didn't match between the Xbox Live account and the Microsoft account associated with that email causing an error, to try and make a new account and make the old account a ""child account"", I have emailed multiple pictures of the error screen. I have been told that this has been escalated and I will hear back in 24-72 hours (three times now), everyone assuring me that this will be solved and a team member would reach out. Nobody ever sent an email or called.

Today, I called back again, retold the whole story, gave the multiple case numbers, and the tech tells me that the account was deleted on 3/19 and there is absolutely no way to recover it or compensate me for the lost purchases. He had no explanation as to why, if the account was deleted, there are multiple cases with other techs telling me the problem would be solved, or why they would waste my time if this was an unsolvable issue. He insinuated that I deleted the account (but that he doesn't have a record of it which is strange), which doesn't make any sense because I can't even log into it, the last time I was logged in, I was literally on a chat with the tech following his instructions on changing the Alias. I am not a dummy either, I would know if I was canceling the account.

Is there any recourse here? All of the purchases, records, friends from over 10+ years are apparently lost and I can't get a straight answer out of Microsoft on any of this. Not being able to game in quarantine hurts, but the lost purchases and friends really stings!

Also not a fan of top down games like Diablo. I don't care if it's a straight forward game like Ryse/Hellblade or an open world RPG like the Witcher. Age of the game doesn't matter either as old graphics do not bother me so 360 games are welcome. Would prefer to have a good story, but not a requirement if it is good gameplay. And I would like this to be an actual hacknslash not a gun combat game that is similar (I love Mass Effect and stuff, but I'm not looking for stuff like that rn)

Games I played and enjoyed

Ryse

Hellblade

For Honor (campaign)

AC Odyssey

Witcher 3

Skyrim+Oblivion

Fable

Games I didn't like and have played:

Dragon Age

Batman

Monster Hunter

Darksiders (played the first one, just not into the art style again, but the gameplay is what I liked)

Dark Souls (I liked everything besides sucking ass and dying repeatedly)

Games I have, but haven't played:

Kingdome Come Deliverance

Shadow of Mordor

Witcher 2

AC Origins

Games I'm looking at after searching the sub:

Kingdoms of Amular

Dragons Dogma

Bound by Flame

The cursed crusade (although reviews are pretty bad)

Greedfall

fqiy43,tybearrr,Xbox One X February 2020 Update HDCP Issues,"So recently as of late March 2020 I tried to rent a movie on my Xbox One X from the Xbox Movies &amp; TV app as I've done literally over a hundred times over the years. This time however as the movie began to load up I was presented with an HDCP error: oxc00d7159. This has never ever happened before so I was confused and began to do the usual Googling to try and resolve the issue. Surprisingly it seems that no one is really experiencing this issue right now so I couldn't find any concrete solutions. The closes problem to my own suggested that I switch my HDMI inputs around but I tried that and still nothing. 

I am using the same HDMI cable that came with my One X and I'm connected to a Samsung PN51F5300 51-Inch 1080p tv. It's an old tv at this point but I've watched many movies over the Movies &amp; TV app with this exact setup for years so it shouldn't be a hardware issue. And I just recently found out that I can't watch anything on Disney+ either because I get an error code 39 whenever I try to start a show or movie.

The last time I successfully watched something on the Movies &amp; TV app was on February 27, 2020 which was exactly the day my Xbox shows it was last updated. So I'm thinking that the DRM that HDCP is currently using for some reason decided that my current hardware is no longer compatible with some streaming services. Netflix &amp; YouTube are still working no problem for now, it's just the other two previously mentioned that are useless at the moment. 

I'm hoping there's somebody out there that can give some suggestions that don't involve dropping a couple hundred bucks on a new TV just to watch Disney+ &amp; rent movies again lol.

fqi4fb,adishooor,Network Errors," 

Hey guys, looking for some quick advice.

I am running a 1 GB fiber-link network from my ISP. They provided me with a ZTE F660 ONT that is set in bridge mode. One CAT5E cable from the ONT goes straight into the INTERNET port on my newly-acquired TP-Link Archer C2. This router is set up to run the PPPOE connection and to run as a Wi-Fi router with two networks, one 2.4 Ghz and one 5 Ghz. DHCP is enabled and all settings for IPV6 and the 5 Ghz network seem okay. The problems I encounter are the following:

1. My Xbox One S has the NAT type as Strict and recognizez Double NAT. It also refuses to connect to the 5 GhZ network, it only works on the 2.4 GhZ one.
2. Both my ISP and my router support IPV6, but neither Xbox or the IPV6 test site recognizes my setup as running IPV6.

Any ideas on how I could fix these issues? Thanks.",1,1585393489,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fqi4fb/network_errors/,xboxone,1

fqgiza,sh6dc,Entertainment world affecting by rich china people #2,"Hi   r/xboxone

My question is

Any chance put my story to news/ magazine/ etc?

=====

This includes many movie stars/ Yes Im telling about I knew all the

reason Why many popular Western film/movies Some of their scene are so

weird... Make no-sense... There's some powerful/rich people try put

their personal idea/habit to western entertainment

=====

For example : it chapter 2 2019 why McAvoy can't talk to people

correctly In film? Because in reality I always stutter on my words

when I get nervous/angry.

=====

Yes Chinese Spy my internet 24/7 Spy my house 24/7 They want write me

""into"" many western film. Its a joke They just copy the shining 1980

kubricks idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Think this way

I said china is 3rd world their people are just bad joke back to 2017 on internet

because they Spy my internet and house 24/7

So they knew i said these words

also they Try find out how I make a "" little money "" online

been 7-8 years spy

this never end lol

When they fail they start mad post me to public

Omg All the people in my town start hate me

Even i move to another place

IT never end all the people just same

They keep post me to public no matter what city i go...

I go city #A they start post me in #A try use #A public kill me for good

i go city #B they just repeat the same

This is shit bad about how people live in there.

Even the fucking school

The student lol

All people knew me.

&amp;#x200B;

So these rich "" high-end "" people start hate me too

because i said something they dont like

You can think they from ""government""

&amp;#x200B;

They think China is good place.

And use their money and resource to laugh me.

In this way

They ruined a lot of stuff that could be good

They changed many west entertainment original idea turn them into bad

just for their own purpose...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

fqfx3z,squimbyy,Need help with Xbox/ WiFi issues...,"
Okay, so currently I have an Xbox One that runs off a WiFi router which is down the hallway in another room. This is just a basic optimum router. I don‚Äôt have the option to hardwire with an Ethernet cable or move my router.

My connection is not good, download speed is very slow and I lag a lot in game and have poor ping which I believe is caused from a lot of devices on the WiFi (3 cellphones, 2 smart TVs, 3 laptops, iPad and my Xbox).

Recently I bought a net gear WiFi extender to see if that would help and the wireless did not so I hardwired my Xbox into the extender with an Ethernet cable which solved all my issues for about an hour before going back to complete crap and the thing is basically useless.

Basically I need to be pointed in the right direction. I am not sure if getting a better router will help solve my issues or not. I have also seen things about TP link ports that you can plug in a wall outlet and hardwire through that?

I called in to ask why there wasn‚Äôt an option for repair last week and the person explain they are having shutdowns so they can‚Äôt at this time which I completely understand. My issue is that whatever they did at the repair department actually made my controllers worse. I‚Äôd like to send them in whenever they can take repairs again but my warranty will expire most likely when they are able to take repair orders.

fqew47,MarioToo,25 months of Game Pass Ultimate for $75,"So last month, in February 2020, Family Dollar had 3 month Xbox Live Gold cards on sale for $10 (reg. $24.99). I knew my Game Pass Ultimate was set to renew on 3/28/2020, so rather than renew for $14.99, or buying a year of Gold for $60, I bought six 3 month cards for $60. I waited until it expired today, and reverted back to Gold by adding these cards. 

I made sure I turned off Recurring Billing, and added the first card. It offered me a free month if I turned on recurring billing. I then proceeded to turn it back it off via the Xbox support website after adding each card, and it offered me another free month to turn it back on after each card. So basically, I purchased 18 months of Gold for $60, which turned into 24 months after using the recurring billing trick. I then re-subscribed to Ultimate for $14.99 (it didn‚Äôt let me do the $1 as that‚Äôs a one time deal) and it obviously added another month onto the back end for ‚Äúbuying‚Äù a month of Game Pass Ultimate. 

So, in a nutshell, I saved over $300 doing it this way as Game Pass Ultimate @ $14.99/mo for 25 months = $374.75, plus tax. Just a heads up for anyone who is about to expire, or whenever you expire, even at full price, 2 years of Gold would be $120 (if you can‚Äôt a deal like I did, but there‚Äôs usually always something if you look around), plus 2 extra months if you use the recurring billing trick, would end up 27 months for $120, still saving you over $250.",7,1585377019,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fqew47/25_months_of_game_pass_ultimate_for_75/,xboxone,1

fqeotp,jlwas227,Pay It Forward ‚Äî Receive a Gift Card,"Good evening r/XboxOne,

Inspired by Reddit user u/bmalones, I would like to pay it forward to as many people as possible. 

Being that I am a youth musical instructor, I have been out of work and haven‚Äôt been as financially active as usual. Sadly, many people around the world are completely out of work and find themselves in a tight position. 

In order to brighten up the day of someone you may know, I would like to play a little game with the users of this community for a couple days, weeks, or until the gift reaches someone in need.

Here‚Äôs how I would like this to work: I ask that whomever is reading this to comment below acknowledging that they would like to participate. Within 24 hours I will choose a random comment and PM that person the code, BUT they cannot redeem the code to any account that they have access to. It would now be that person‚Äôs responsibility to pass the unredeemed code to someone that they know who is in actual need of the code OR they may choose to pass the code to a trusted individual and ask them to pass it down even farther. 

With each pass, I will continue to check the redemption status of the code and I may ask the person to provide proof in anyway possible to check the credibility of their kind gesture. 

I ask that you do not participate if you know that you will ‚Äústeal‚Äù the code or if you have any plans to redeem it to any account you have access to. 

Just know, at the end of the day you and I will both know that you blatantly deceived me and robbed a gift from another. 

This is completely experimental, as I am doing this merely to test the honesty, morals, and kindness of the users in this community. Thank you for participating. Stay safe.",16,1585376018,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fqeotp/pay_it_forward_receive_a_gift_card/,xboxone,1

fqa8k4,ZonksTheSequel,Xbox One X - some advice about thermal pads upgrade,"I wanted to make a separate post about this for anyone searching in the future. Recently I took my Xbox One X apart to redo the thermal paste and pads (it was sounding like a jet engine and yes, the paste was a nasty dried factory-applied mess), and I had a rough experience of when I put it back together the Xbox fan spun up hardcore and the entire thing shut down to avoid disastrous overheating failures (thankfully this saved it, twice).

Turns out it was the thermal pads. I purchased [these pads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A9RHAH4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) after seeing them recommended her on reddit on another post. DO NOT buy these. They don't compress like the original ""clay"" material and at 2mm they are too thick. The heat sink did not  make full contact with the APU, thus causing the overheat and shutdown (and you could feel cold air coming out the back of the Xbox, another sign it wasn't making contact).

[These are the pads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZJS5M60/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) that you want to use if you're replacing your thermal pads.

Combined with [this thermal paste](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0795DP124/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and [these tools](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BT16WZ7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu5y0psWNk0&amp;t=207s) you'll have a very easy time upgrading your thermals for your Xbox One X without the issues that I experienced.

fq9poi,minty1120,Nothing Loads Without Taking Leads Out,"So I have a bit of a strange ritual going with my Xbox at present. I use my controller to power on my xbox like always have done. However, for the last two weeks whenever I do this my xbox seems to start up in a wierd frozen state. 

I can move around the menus and select things but when I click on a game or app to launch, it will load up but get stuck and then maybe 30 seconds to a minute later it closes with a message stating that the app took longer than usual to load.

Any download I have running will be stuck at whatever the last download speed was, for example it was downloading at 70Mbps before I switched the xbox off, when I turn it on again it is now stuck at 70Mbps (but not actually downloading)

It just seems the whole xbox is stuck. I can't restart console, because then it leaves me with a blank screen but the xbox stays on. I have to turn it off, take the power lead out the back, wait 2 minutes and then plug it back in before it will work again.

Any suggestions or advice is greatly appreciated.",1,1585355827,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fq9poi/nothing_loads_without_taking_leads_out/,xboxone,1

So far I have found this issue posted in forums for Forza, Gears, For Honor, and Modern Warfare. I posted in the MW sub recently but have found that this is an Xbox issue and not game-specific. 

When I take game clips, some of them are completely fine, but I have had HUNDREDS of clips cut short to 3-8 second clips. This is heartbreaking because they are all useless now. I am trying to make content but this is currently my only option for recording. 

PLEASE do not tell me to check my clip length. Believe me, I spend a ton of time looking into my issue before posting anything for help. I have tried absolutely everything recommended on the Xbox forums and nothing helps. I had this issue on Xbox One X in November, but I switched back to my original Xbox One and hadn‚Äôt experienced it again until a couple months ago. It is clearly an issue with the Xbox DVR feature, possibly because of an update. 

As a person who plays for clips, this takes away my drive to play at all. If anyone has any weird fixes to recommend, or a more specific way to contact Xbox (that isn‚Äôt going to give me robot suggestions) I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

I have one console. On it, there's my account (which currently has game pass ultimate and will expire soon), and my brother's, which never had a game pass ultimate subscription. I downloaded Forza Horizon 4 the other week because he wanted to try it out, and I was surprised to see that it can be played on his profile even though he doesn't have a subscription.

Along with playing the single player aspect of Forza, he is also able to play online.

I was going to renew my game pass ultimate sub on my account, but I realized, if these subscriptions can be shared on one account, does that mean I can instead capitalize on the $1/month deal for new accounts with my brother's profile rather than spending $14.99 again? If he buys it, will both accounts be able to access the benefits of the subscription (assuming they don't play at once)? I just want to make absolutely sure.

Vrally is a bit more expensive and i'm not exactly bill gates but i am willing to sacrifice 60 bucks instead of forza's 40 if it is supposedly worth those extra 20 bucks. 



Which would be better for a from time to time quick offline (don't have gold or live or whatever) session with my dad. Is the campain any good? Is it worth without multiplayer? Does it have any replay value?

I know this has been dragged through the mud but I'd really appreciate some advice.

I was wondering if anyone had a decent site which outlines the best settings to use for smoother frame rates, e.g should I be using 4K and 60hz or 1440 120hz? Are there any specific picture settings I need to tweak?

I'd be super grateful if anyone is around to help with this as I spent most of yesterday looking into this and found so many conflicting posts.

Rocket League does - we can play split screen and invite pals to our game. This worked great!

Halo MCC does - I have played 4 people on my console (split screen) and then joined more people online.

What other games allow this? It is surprisingly hard to google and find this answer.

fpseil,_Vixxaa_,Xbox One X - Bluetooth Headsets Constantly Cutting Out,"Hey, so I'm not sure if anyone may have a solution to this problem, or at least a working theory of what the issue is: But basically I had a Razer Thresher headset that quit working on my Xbox One X completely out of the blue...it would just constantly lose its Bluetooth connection and constantly reconnect, this would last maybe 15 seconds before it would lose the connection again. The weird part is the headset works perfectly fine on PC. Just cannot maintain a connection on console.

 Anyways, so I replaced it with Astros A20's and the connection was fine. I've had this pair for maybe 5 days now and I haven't had any issue with the Bluetooth connection. Until today- out of nowhere the same issue. Mic connection just gradually started cutting out more and more.

I've determined the headsets cannot be bad. They both work fine on PC, so I know it's something with my Xbox... I thought maybe the USB port was bad, but my wired controller can use the same port without ever malfunctioning or turning off.
So the only other thing I could think is something about the motherboard has gone bad... If that's the case is there any fix I can do at home, or does anyone know if I can send it in to Microsoft without warranty and pay for a repair?

Alternatively is there any other possible explanation for this issue besides bad motherboard?",1,1585292236,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fpseil/xbox_one_x_bluetooth_headsets_constantly_cutting/,xboxone,1

Ive also changed the batteries I had a recharge pack before which i replaced with fresh double As and it still does it.  I thought it was my headset at first because i would mess around with the aux cable when it was plugged into the 3.5mm jack and it would disconnect but today while I was idle with no headset plugged in my controller disconnected all by itself for like 5 secs yet again.  i honestly have no clue what to do and when i check the battery life on the menu it tells me that the batteries are fully charged and they are fresh batteries.  any help or input would be greatly appreciated.,3,1585290132,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fps0mb/controller_keeps_disconnecting/,xboxone,1

fprs0q,randoggthegreat,Cutscenes in almost all of my games have desyncing audio/video.,"Hey all.

So like the title says, in a lot of my games (especially newer one like Borderlands 3, Jedi Fallen Order) I've been having cutscene issues. This doesn't happen in gameplay but it gets very frustrating watching brand new games stutter.

I have a Gears of War 4 Xbox One S that I bought back in February 2017. I have 61 games installed on a 4 TB HDD and 48 on the Internal. All of them are Digital. I do have a 1 TB SSD that I can use but I haven't moved anything over to it yet. 

The audio will fall behind the video in cutscenes and stay desynced until the it ends. I've hard reset the Xbox multiple times but that doesn't fix it. I thought about uninstalling and reinstalling some games, but if brand new releases have this issue then I don't think that will fix it either. Can't think of any other alternative fixes at the moment.

My theory is that the xbox will basically become a PC. It will have tons of power, and will have a outstanding UI for games abd Internet browsing. We can already see some of these steps being put into place. The xbox one already has an internet browser built in, a bad one at that, and the series x is incredibly powerful. Microsoft also is starting to support PC more. They are bringing xbox exclusives to the PC, meaning they want people playing together, no matter the platform. It would be a smart move and a big money saver since they would only be making one console. Games and stuff would be released more frequently because everyone is mainly focusing on one platform. More sales too because people wouldnt be buying the new windows, but instead the one in all xbox.
      Of course this is just a theory that i made up in the past 10 minutes, and is incredibly far fetched. But it would make a lot of sense for microsoft to do this. They have the materials, knowledge and are already doing some of it.

Power supply and HDMI cable are all fine so those are not the problem.

fppj5j,The_UnApologist,"Xbox still proudly sells Black Ops 2 in the online store, yet the game is in an absurdly laughably broken state thanks to hackers. How is this even allowed?","If Xbox wasn't busy trying to kiss ass with publishers, they'd look out for players *proper* by giving those publishers the gears about keeping hackers and other douchebags from completely breaking their games. 

Black Ops 2 for example. Hugely popular Call of Duty title. Has a great community of dedicated players and competitors and people like myself who love firing it up for the nostalgia of it all. Yet the game is practically in a broken unplayable state because hackers and other misfit douchebags have completely over-run it. 

How is this game even allowed to be sold in the online store still in it's sorry state? Game's literally broken when it comes to multiplayer. You can't throw a stone in it without hitting a hacker now. It's been completely ruined for the dedicated community of fair and legitimate players who loved it. It sorta breaks my heart to see it slide into such a sorry state. 

People have speculated and brainstormed all sorts of ideas to keep these old online games alive and competitive. A subscription service, remasters, you name it. The real issue though is how Xbox themselves allow games this broken to be continually sold in it's online store. 

Xbox and by association Microsoft who are the world's largest software publisher should have an obligation to give publishers like Activision the gears about smartening up and making sure their games aren't this broken. Who knows though why they won't. You wouldn't be allowed to sell something this broken in any other industry, why is it allowed here in this case? 

Unpopular opinion, downvote me away or whatever, but don't call me wrong about this. Sure the game can be over-run and broken by hackers, but stop selling it in the store, then. This sucks, I am heartbroken whenever I fire up Black Ops 2 for a little nostalgia and it's in the state it is, not from the developers lack of interest or commitment, but from *players* ruining it.

fpksor,stayingputforyou,New to Xbox One Questions,"Hi all!

I was a pretty avid gamer in my teens, had a 360 and really great memories. As a result, after feeling sad about being laid off from my job due to COVID-19 and then getting a bunch of amazon gift cards for my birthday earlier this week, I bit the bullet and bought a cheap xbox one digital ([this one](https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-All-Digital-Console-Disc-Free-Gaming/dp/B07XQXZXJC/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=xbox+one&amp;qid=1585260350&amp;sr=8-2)). What better way to relive my childhood? 

I had some questions that I realise are super-newbie-ish but needed some help in anticipation of the xbox one coming on Saturday. 

* I read somewhere that a chat headset comes with some xbox one models? Is this true for the digital xbox one S? If not, can any headphones plug into the controller? I wasn't sure if I should use my regular headphones or buy a new headset. I am very poor at the moment for obvious corona reasons - can anyone recommend a good, cheap headset? it's mainly for chat - I don't need game audio thru it - I remember as a teen I preferred being able to hear the game audio on the tv and the chat through the headset so want to keep to that. 
* I read that I'll be getting a free month xbox live with the console - will this code work on existing gamertag? I'll be using my 360 gamertag. 
* Outside of the game pass games - is there any games you recommend getting? I would love to get red dead redemption 2 but everywhere I look seems pretty pricey - is there a good place to buy digital copies/codes that are cheap?
* REALLY dumb question - does the controller packaged with the console come with batteries? Is it cheaper/better to keep buying batteries or what rechargeable pack do you recommend? 
* Finally - the only two reasons I am getting the xbox is to play with my old high school friends who still have theirs (feels like getting the band back together...) and split screen with my girlfriend - so I won't have many online friends per se. Drop me a PM if you are interested in gaming together - could probably do with some online buddies in this weird time!

I want to download a Jackbox pack and stream it to mixxer, have everyone load mixxer onto their roku boxes (there‚Äôs an official app, just needs to be loaded outside of the roku app browser), and then we can all play.

Question is, can I keep the stream private but let them be able to find it on their boxes? Or do I just have to hope for obscurity in numbers? Also,  Do any of the JB games have extra privacy besides just the one code? I‚Äôve only streamed a few times to show a friend a game and I‚Äôve never hosted a jackbox game. Also, one of the households has no computer (my parents) that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going the mixxer/roku route.

I‚Äôd usually try to figure things out on my own, but I‚Äôm in an ‚Äúessential‚Äù manufacturing job and working overtime since we‚Äôre on a near skeleton crew.

fpjxd0,BlackLock23,Need help from you guys with a game recommendationüíö,"Hey,

TL;DR First: I would so appreciate a game recommendation. The requirements are a little different, it has to have been made with love and inspiration, I'm leaning towards a non-main-stream title that you've fallen deeply in love with. Also, if it's totally offline that would be a huge help. (Could get internet from the right game)


Full explanation:

I played RDR2 first, initially thought it was amazing, soon found it to be a huge money grab with not much heart somehow. (I'm sure it's perfect for some!)
Next I played The Witcher 3, I do love it but some of it seems to be just massive attempts to extend the length of the game without much care for it's content (some if it though is deffinitely wonderfully done, and the adult content is a plus).


It's very hard to find recommendations for a game like what I'm looking for. On Google search it only comes up with mainstream giants.

fpjfgi,jkliewer1,Xbox One controller joystick fix,"My brothers controller is having issues with the left joystick on his Xbox one controller. It is out of warranty so we wanted to see if we could fix it ourselves. 
Basically the issue is that when he pressed the joystick in the upwards direction it doesn't detect it unless he pushes up really hard. When he pushes up hard it then takes a few seconds for it to register and then starts moving. Then when he releases it it takes a moment for it to stop detecting it. 
We took it apart and used some compressed air to try to get out any junk that would cause this, but it still does the same thing. We also tried moving the stick with the front cover off (which allows the stick to travel slightly farther) and once we pushed it all the way forward it had no problem responding.

      Recently got xbox live on a console that me and my ex housemate bought a year or so ago. He had xbox live but when he left, I paid him out, deleted his account and used my own to set up on.
     Since I did this it allows me to join games and be online (GTA, Minecraft, rocket league) but after a while it will kick me out. 
Not only out of the game session but it will sign my account out and disconnect me from my WiFi connection. The only way to get back on then is to `Set up wireless network 'and enter the WiFi password for the network I was already on!
Not sure whether(or even how) to factory reset and start again and if this will affect progress and purchases??

fpf1xt,Satriani10,TV for the upcoming Xbox,"Ok, ya‚Äôll need to help me out with my TV purchase. 

So I am in the market for a new TV. Prime use case: for now Netflix and a lot of gaming with the upcoming xbox. I have no dedicated dark cinema room. But there are blackout blinds in our bedroom. Me and the wife usually watch tv after it‚Äôs dark. But gaming will be primarily with ambient light or during day time.

I would say I‚Äôm a rather seasoned gamer sensitive to input lag - which is why I am going the LG vs Samsung route. Vizio and Hisense is unfortunately not available in germany although I‚Äôve heard great things.

Here are the options:
Samsung 75‚Äô Q90r (it has FreeSync. And an hdmi 2.1 port, without eARC though. But insanely bad blooming in game mode from what i‚Äôve seen online) 2800‚Ç¨
LG 86‚Äô sm9000 (Gsync instead of FreeSync. Hdmi 2.1. But srsly worse performance) also around 2800‚Ç¨
LG 77‚Äô C9 (gsync, best performance in low light and game mode. 2.1 hdmi ports.) 4000‚Ç¨

1.So my question is. Is the Oled worth it in a non-dedicated room for gaming and netflix? There will be some light, meaning that I probably won‚Äôt be noticing the inky blacks that much, right? 

2.Another consideration - LGs have no g-sync support, which, as far as I understand, is not the standard AMD GPUs use (including the upcoming xbsx). 

3.The nextgen consoles advertise 4k120 fps. But it‚Äôs the ‚Äúup to‚Äù description which makes me wonder... can any console priced at 500‚Ç¨ pull off 120 in 4k? In StarWars Battlefront for example? Since I‚Äôm primarily a multiplayer gamer - I can imagine that these titles can reach 120fps. 

4.If the new consoles will handle only 4k60, am I not better off saving some dough and just going with an hdmi 2.0 tv instead? Like the q70r in 82‚Äô?

So... in the end... 3 options:
Blooming in game mode with freesync;
Awesome picture quality at a big price with gsync;
Worse quality panel with a huge diagonal.",1,1585241870,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fpf1xt/tv_for_the_upcoming_xbox/,xboxone,3

fpb4ez,Naekh,Best Xbox One Headset for 60 to 75 euros ?,"Hello there. My trusty but old headset died and I need to replace him. It was a random 25 euros headset that I plugged via jack. Sound was horrible and cable was dodgy. 

Anyway I figured since I mainly play on my Xbox now that I would somewhat invest in a decent headset. Wired or not does not matter, but I think in that price range I will look at wired. 

I need something reliable with decent sound quality and as I play when my daughter sleeps something I can still hear the baby monitor through? 

I also don't play online or with people so microphone quality does not matter at all. 

Can you please recommend a brand/model to me? If it's cheaper than 75 euros I won't complain either \^\^

I was playing a Fifa Ultimate team match online.  The score is 4-4, I just equalized with 10 minutes left and then boom.... Game freezes Xbox console update screen pops up... Why? I mean it's 2020, isn't it possible to wait 5 minutes with an update, or programming those updates not to force start if you are in an online game?  Of course the game quits... and books this as a forfeit.

It hurts because I NEVER forfeit a match in any game (even if the opponent leads by far)  - its a principle of mine. I'm gonna get less in-game money after matches bc of the forfeit

- Rocket League (their favorite so far)
- Super Mega Baseball (another fav since little league has been indefinitely postponed)
- Human Fall Flat (controls are tricky for them but I‚Äôve enjoyed it)
- Forza Horizon 4 (fun but chaotic, they‚Äôve spent more time off road then on)
- Bridge Constructor Portal (7yo likes it but too hard for 5yo ho gets impatient, single player)
- Banjo Kazooie (corrupt download, twice)
- LEGO Worlds (haven‚Äôt tried yet)

Game Pass looks like a good deal. I set up them up with family profiles and it seems like I could pay for myself and they will also get the benefits, right? What if my membership lapses? I assume games can‚Äôt be played?

Both these things seem to happen every single game, multiple times per game.

I get heroic is the highest difficulty but it seems like a pretty huge issue that the game is selecting only a handful of the city cards with multiple outbreaks every other draw. This usually leads to a loss in about 15 turns which makes me want the 20 bucks back.

So I was just curious if anyone here has had any similar issues and found any work around for the achievement, I love this game and getting so close to perfecting it so if I‚Äôm screwed out of this 1 achievement I‚Äôm going to be pretty annoyed, thanks",2,1585192393,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fp46hh/help_with_conqueror_achievement_in_ac_odyssey/,xboxone,1

So as anyone who lives on earth and pays attention would know, games with gold recently have been a bit disappointing, at least in most people‚Äôs eyes. So I was thinking, how could they upgrade this system? and I came up with an idea, maybe a dumb idea, but an idea nonetheless.

So what if they completely scrapped games for gold and focused directly on game pass BUT for people with gold, you get 2 claims for a game pass game a month, one at the start and one in the middle. This means that people would be able to choose what they want themselves without having to be disappointed. Now they would have to add games frequently to deal with this, but that‚Äôs besides the point. And for the game pass owners, they would get access to all the games with a week early access to games being added on. If they decide to cancel their game pass membership, then they get claims for the period of time they were on game pass (so 4 months = 8 claims).

foydgg,500php,Tip for Spotify users that need volume lower,"Do you ever wish you could enjoy your music but still be able to hear footsteps in-game? 

Is your music still too loud even with the Xbox Spotify volume @ its lowest?

I was having this same issue and I tried googling to see if I could get the increments at single % levels rather than @ 5% increments. The answer to that is no, I found out. 

But.

I came to the realization that if I could control songs through my phone and still have it playing through Xbox. Could I control volume? You can. 

Open up your Spotify app on your Xbox, play a song, then open up Spotify on your mobile device. (This might actually work on PC, but I'm too lazy to check) While listening to a song, the bottom details will show you that you're broadcasting. Click on the speaker w/ ""Xbox One"" being displayed. The next screen should have a volume slider for the device your broadcasting through, in this case being your Xbox one. 

So put your Xbox Spotify app @ 5%, and manipulate your slider! (If you need it quieter)",5,1585170776,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/foydgg/tip_for_spotify_users_that_need_volume_lower/,xboxone,1

HOWEVER, if you purchase Game Pass Ultimate it will automatically cancel your Xbox Live subscription. Then, if you decide you don't want Game Pass anymore and try to cancel your Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you will lose out on all of your prepaid months of Xbox Live with no refund. 

All of this is stated in the terms &amp; conditions when purchasing Game Pass Ultimate. So make sure you read and understand what you are purchasing. 

If you do not want your Xbox Live converted to Game Pass Ultimate, then you can just purchase Xbox Game Pass for Console. 

If you do accidentally cancel you Xbox Live subscription with no refund, then go to  [https://beta.support.xbox.com/contact-us](https://beta.support.xbox.com/contact-us)  and request a call to discuss getting your lost months of Live back. You can only request calls during business hours.

Most of you reading this probably see this all as common sense, but with the new influx of Xbox owners and Game Pass users, it can be confusing for some people who are unfamiliar with gaming services and subscriptions.

fouwq7,ThomasdeB1505,I categorised all game pass games because of the quarantine,"As the title says I put each game currently available on game pass into a few categories because microsoft apparently doesn't give a shit about categorizing games. Before I start with the categories I have to establish a few ground rules:

- The decision for each category was made through a combination of reading the description, wikipedia page and watching gameplay videos. This means that I may have made a few mistakes, feel free to put any corrections in the comments.

- The games have either no border, or a green or blue border. No border means that it is available on both pc abd xbox, a green border means that it is only available on xbox and a blue border means that it is only available on pc.

- The categories and the games within them are arranged in alphabetical order. And with each category comes an explanation as to what that category entails.

- Action-adventure is not a category because microsoft labels all fucking games as action-adventure 

Let's begin shall we?

An RPG but made in japan.

**[Local multiplayer](http://imgur.com/a/grNPrAA)**     
This includes games that have any form of local multiplayer/co-op in them, this doesn't mean the local multiplayer is fun or good.

**[Metroidvania](http://imgur.com/a/PXYG6A0)**     
Metroidvania often feature a large interconnected map where areas are unlocked by unlocking abilities or simple doors. They also feature combat.

These Games are great to play at parties

**[Pinball](http://imgur.com/a/w9GjRaa)**     
Apparently needing its own genre, games that are based on pinball machines.

**[Simulation](http://imgur.com/a/892Mnuv)**

Games that feature fleshed out stealth mechanics or where you have to be stealthy the entire game.

**[Story driven](http://imgur.com/a/Tj4Ebfr)**     
Story driven means there's a heavy focus on telling a story, that story has to be an interesting one, for example: games like de Blob don't move away from the main story, but don't have much of a story to tell. Story-driven is a compilation of games that you can play to experience a good story.


**[Survival](http://imgur.com/a/PJ7vJO9)**

**[Games that are a disgrace to human evolution so I don't put them on any list](http://imgur.com/a/nE9rckn)**

I miss gaming and my Macbook Air just isn't scratching that itch anymore. I'm pretty out of the loop when it comes to console gaming (last system I owned was a PS2), but I've decided that I'd like to get a console.

I'm leaning toward Xbox (vs. PS4) but had a question about purchasing on older model vs. one of the new ones (S or One X). Is there a significant downside to gaming these days with an older Xbox One model? Is the 1TB hardrive essential for a good gaming experience, for example?

I've found the following prices online. Just want to make sure the newers systems are worth it to justify the price tag: 

Older Xbox Model (+ controllers and some games) \[USED\] ‚Äì Approx. $100

Xbox One S (+ 1 controller) \[NEW\] - $169

Xbox One X (+ 1 controller) - $318

What a crazy month this has been!  There is a lot of scary stuff happening out there and from the GPGC team, we hope you are all doing well and staying as safe as possible!  For all the essential workers still on the front lines, we want to thank you for everything you are doing!  To those staying home and quarantining, thank you for doing your part in keeping the spread of COVID-19 down!

Now on to what a lot of you have been waiting for, Aprils GotM voting thread!!!  Just so everyone is in the loop on how we are moving forward with the game selection process if you didn't know already.  The top two games from last months voting move on to the next month to give them a second chance.  For last month it was Ori and Outer Wilds so they are moving to this months vote.  Now the next three are completely RNG'ed using an excel sheet we have with all current 288 games on Game Pass listed.  Biiiig thanks to [u/Trixxstrr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Trixxstrr/) for finding an excel list and keeping it updated!  From there we used [www.random.org](https://www.random.org/) to generate 3 numbers and then find the number associated with the game.  Easy peasy.  We also randomize the excel sheet as well so it isn't in alphabetical order, by newest last, etc.  Its completely random!

We have heard quite a number of you request this ""feature"" for GPGC and we couldn't think of a better time to do a trial run so for this month we are choosing **TWO** games for selection!  That's right!  This month will feature two games so when voting, please only chose your top two selections!  So now on to what you really really want, our GotM voting selection!

This months games include:

* Ori and the Blind Forest
* Outer Wilds
* Mortal Kombat X
* Wargroove
* Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams

# Vote here: [Poll](https://forms.gle/UY7xk8QnSCAzLoHW7)

Last month a number of you expressed concerns you didn't have enough time to vote or almost missed it.  To eliminate that concern, we are going to run voting for 3 weeks now.  This will help us immensely on the back end getting everything set up for next months games(wikis, discussion logs, posts, etc) as well as give everyone plenty of enough time to vote.  How it will work is, the day we announce the GotM for the coming month, we will put up another poll for the following month that same day/post.  When it comes time to announce the winner from that, we start the process over again and put up another 3 week voting thread.  This way everyone has plenty of time to vote.

# Xbox One X Contest:

Now on to what you really really really want(Starting to sound like a Spice Girls song) to hear about!  We are still running this contest so don't forget you still have time to enter to win a brand new Xbox One X!  Head [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fcozf7/yakuza_0_wiki_discussion_logs_and_xbox_one_x/) to enter!

The cheapest I can find on Facebook market place is around ¬£130 for a used 500mb Xbox One S - with the current uncertainty surrounding my job  I can't afford to expend that so am hoping someone on here may know of some alternatives market places to find a cheap Xbox.

footta,Nsfwvv,"Blazing fast SSDs are going to revolutionize games, and Microsoft would be wise to charge an extra $20 per console and include a 3.8 GB/s SSD that offers speeds closer to the PS5","
Free roam games currently reuse the same assets again and again, and have barely any characters to have complex interactions with in the free roam worlds. This is due to HDD speed. Slow HDD mean things take time to load into the ram, so you need tricks to make people wait while you load up new assets from the HDD into the ram. This is why more complex games are basically corridor shooters.

In Halo, you kill everyone in one area, then you walk across a narrow bridge or take a long elevator ride to get to an area that looks different than the previous area. Or you open a door to enter an area that reuses the same assets as the area you just left, same textures, same enemies, same objects, just placed in different locations. All of this is because it takes too long to load new assets into the ram.

An extremely fast ssd that could fill up the entire ram pool in a second, in the time it takes to turn your character, would enable much richer and more diverse open world games where different parts of the level actually look different but only if the game is designed to take advantage of very fast ssds and the ability to rapidly swap data into and out of the ram.

The Series X is poised to launch at $499. And it will be sold out all year due to production shortages and resellers will turn around and sell it for $999. I would prefer that MS puts in a faster SSD and launch the console for $549 or even $599 and market it as the premier gaming experience. Release the lockhart at $349 for budget conscious gamers and lower the price of both next year once production ramps up and prices fall.

It would cost MS $15-20 to upgrade the ssd from the current 2.5gb/s ssd to a 3.8gb/s ssd raw speed allowing 7.6gb/s compressed speed (much closer to the PS5‚Äôs SSD speed, and fast enough to fill up the entire ram pool in the time it takes to turn your in game character around which basically allows assets to be streamed into view on the fly without any popup, and would completely eliminate all loadtimes since the ram pool could be filled up almost instantly). It would also mean no ram would have to be allocated to the OS, devs get access to the full 16gbs of ram and the os could instead be stored on the ssd instead of the ram when in a game. Microsoft could stick any 2.5gb/s ssds that they bulk ordered into their surface devices and order a fresh batch of 3.8gb/s ssds for the Xbox. 

It would basically be equivalent to the PS4‚Äôs surprise 8gb of ram announcement (that also seemed equally unlikely until it actually happened and the internet went absolutely nuts), but this time it would be Microsoft surprising everyone with significantly higher than expected specs at the last minute.

Now say it would cost them $15 to upgrade to 20gb of ram (14gb running at a high clock speed and 6gb for low clock speed functions such as audio, os, app switching and share features). And say it would cost them $15-20 to upgrade to a higher watt power supply and higher speed fan that would supply enough power to the console to clock the gpu at 2ghz to make it a 14TF console (the ps5 gpu is clocked at 2.3ghz while the series x gpu is clocked at 1.8ghz).

Would you happily pay an extra $50 for the Series X if it came with those three upgrades over the currently announced specs?

Would Microsoft be making a mistake spending and charging an extra $50 per unit to make those three upgrades to ensure the Series X remains superior to both the PS5 and to average gaming PCs in every single respect for the whole generation?

Microsoft wouldn‚Äôt have to stick with just the $550 console. They could still eventually release a Lockhart Xbox with similar specs except for a 500gb SSD 3.8gb/s and 5TF gpu to target 1080p tvs only for $350 and have a console for price concious customers

To really take advantage of the SSD, I really hope Microsoft doesnt mandate any more first party games be forced to run on Xbox One consoles or on any PCs with nonSata4 ssds inside. It would be sad if you we had to wait for years to see a game that fully takes advantage of SSD speeds to eliminate load times entirely and offer up diverse open world games that actually feel open and full of variety.

I am considering the PS5 due to the fact that I hate load times and anticipate that Half Life Alyx will be released on PSVR2 but if MS packs a beefier SSD, I would happily pay $600 for the Xbox Series X at launch and forego the PS5 (doubly so if Microsoft announces support for the vive or index or oculus so that i could play Half Life Alyx on xbox).

#The consoles are going to have massive shortages all year anyways, so people will be reselling them for $1000 at launch. Microsoft should just beef up the SSD and launch at $600 (it will sell out regardless) and announce Lockhart at $350 for next year for price sensitive consumers. Prices will fall next year and they will have such a superior console that even PC gamers would envy it.",18,1585136253,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/footta/blazing_fast_ssds_are_going_to_revolutionize/,xboxone,1

foo5mi,jaxkjaxk,Today is a sad day,"My og xbox is not turning on again. I have this for about four or five years now and it's been a blast playing with it.

My wife and my daughter were playing the sims 4 when it happen. They were playing like usual and suddenly there was a blackout and the electricity was cut off for a while. It happened before, I was in a middle of a gaming session and the electricity suddenly turned off, and it was fine. But today is different, after the electricity turned back on, my daughter immediately asked her mother to play sims again with her and the xbox won't turn on.

I checked it and tried it myself. Try turning it on with controller, with the button, nothing worked. Then I checked the power brick (this is the OG so it still has the big brick), and it was dead silent and no light indicator to be seen. I tried plugging it out and back in again, tried in another power outlet, and nothing.

I'm really sad because I cannot play with it anymore, not to mention that my wife and daughter cannot play with it anymore and they love to play sims there.

I don't know whether I should try to buy another power brick and hoping it is just the power brick. I don't have the option to upgrade now since budget is a bit tight and no room for a new console.

So I think I'll be gone for a while, hopefully it's just a power brick problem and my family and I can all go back to gaming on the Xbox.",3,1585132785,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/foo5mi/today_is_a_sad_day/,xboxone,1

foo2yl,mattSNIPESyou,**Been wondering this for a while.**,"Is there a way to use your Xbox app to talk in game chat, not party chat?

[I feel like this would be a cool feature for people that have mic issues, if this isn‚Äôt a thing.]



I‚Äôm trying to get an adapter for my headset, because the connector in the design has a trs output and not a trrs, like what is needed for microphone output.

**For those that have issues, currently these are my only solutions.**

-use the Xbox app party chat and throw a headphone inside the headset, so you can hear game volume, as well.

-get an adaptor, that has a mic included in the cord, that has the correct connectors, which can be confusing, so you have a headset and a mic without apps and multiple cords.
(Keep in mind that you may need the Xbox headset adaptor as well, looks like a trapezoid)

-go the pricy route and get a bluetooth (again, trapezoid) adapter for the controller, to connect Bluetooth headsets to the controller wirelessly. There might be input mic lag to the party/game, due to the nature of Bluetooth.

-just using your phone as a mic, with the Xbox app, and play with no headset and open air audio from your display.

-Lastly, with much frustration, Get a new headset.
(that actually works with the Xbox controller, usually a Xbox headset)


*my problem stems from wanting to play with random players and not have to stop playing mid-match and invite them to a party. It‚Äôs a lot of wasted time and effort, imo. Playing with game chat on allows for you to play with your mic outputting the audio to other players in-game audio. It‚Äôs much easier.*


I‚Äôm gonna write this down here for my fellow Bose headset owners. ( Bose qc35 1 2 qc25 )
Sad days for us 3rd party headset owners.

If you‚Äôre having problems with Bose headphones, for qc35 1 /2 and qc25, you can use the qc25 replacement cord for a mic adaptor. I‚Äôve heard this is the best solution and I‚Äôm trying to get mine soon. Check the Bose website for reference of what it would look like, prior to buying one. If you do buy a random brand, make sure the connections are compatible. You have to even shave down the plastic a little on the Bose q25 replacement cable for it to fit in the tighter cable opening. I wish the best of luck for y‚Äôall.

fokmq8,edgyasscream,Xbox Account Hacked and Support Is A Dead End,"In late 2018 my family bought the Xbox One and eventually linked it to Xbox Live Gold to our main account we used originally from Xbox 360. Due to family issues in early 2019 we weren‚Äôt able to play the console as often as we‚Äôd have liked. Within the span of time having the Xbox One, we bought several DLC items and content. Not to mention the amount of achievements that we gained over the years from our time playing on the Xbox 360. 

Now that the family issues had been resolved, we started to get back into playing the console this year to find that we can‚Äôt log into the main Xbox account. So, thinking it to be the password not being correct (although we had it written down), we went to Xbox Support which directed us to several articles from the Microsoft site or the virtual agent. We had to go offsite to find a phone number and once calling any of the numbers‚ÄîI believe we tried at least 7‚Äîthey all ended in the same result. A dead end. Going to the Account Recovery form would tell us that our email didn‚Äôt exist to an Xbox account and phone calls resulted in being hung up on after being redirected to the Xbox.com/help URL. The email to the account doesn‚Äôt exist to Microsoft. Yes, we created it from scratch. We‚Äôve called many times and attempted just as many recovery forms hoping the email would be recognized as existing.

Looking through the same email and sifting through old messages, we found that on January 1st, 2020 the account‚Äôs password was changed without our knowledge. On the same day two separate foreign email addresses were added to the ‚Äúsecurity info‚Äù while deleting our main email from the Xbox account. This basically maroons us out of the account since both the email and the password has been changed. On March 21st, I remembered that I once used the Xbox Console Companion app on my laptop to link up our account to the computer. Going to the app, it automatically attempts to log me into a different foreign account, a third new and alien email. As of yet, this is the only new information, but I believe that this new email could be the culprit. I tried going through account recovery with this email instead of our main email but without certain information it of course wouldn‚Äôt go through and we were sent back with a case rejection.

I believe we have proof of the account having existed and that it belonged to me and my family. We discovered the account was hacked on March 4th and have been attempting to get the account back ever since. We‚Äôve been through articles, Xbox support, and I‚Äôve made a reddit post about it 3 days ago (which will be linked at the end of this post). Nothing has granted any step further to recovering the account or even having it deleted. I don‚Äôt want to contact Outlook or Hotmail because I don‚Äôt believe they will aid in returning our account to us. As I said in the first post I made, we‚Äôve exhausted just about every source of information trying to get it back.

**Some More** **Important information:** There wasn‚Äôt two-step verification on the account. The account was made a long time ago when we got the Xbox 360. I believe there to be proof of our ownership of the account. One of the reasons we want the account back is due to the amount of paid content placed into it and the information about us it contains. The gamertag was generated after the creation as we made the account from scratch with the email having existed before. If images are applicable and allowed to be shown which provide the hacker‚Äôs email addresses then I will add them accordingly if allowed. I believe the only solution to this problem is to contact a MS team member, but I haven‚Äôt been lucky yet as to contacting anyone to help. Is there any other way of contacting someone other than the ways I‚Äôve already tried? And due to rule #4, I‚Äôm not sure if this kind of post is allowed on this subreddit. I‚Äôm not an avid reddit user and mainly just lurk from post to post, until now where I need help.

I am only being refunded the price for the 1 month of Game Pass Ultimate.

I can't submit a refund request because I purchased Xbox Live Gold more than 30 days ago.

Calling customer service just redirects me to  [https://beta.support.xbox.com/contact-us](https://beta.support.xbox.com/contact-us) 

Following this link, requesting a call is unavailable, and the online text chat with an expert just lead to being told to contact the customer service number that I already called.

Is there any way I can get a refund, or get the remainder of my Xbox Live Gold subscription back?

fokcat,PrimerFender,Xbox All Access - Issue: No Game Pass Ultimate Included,"Hello,

Wondering if anyone has had a similar problem. TL;DR: Game Pass Ultimate is not available to be claimed in Account menu, not sure how best to proceed.

I ordered my Xbox All Access - Xbox One S 1TB All-Digital Edition from Amazon a few days ago and today it has arrived. In the Amazon instructions for claiming the Game Pass Ultimate, I am supposed to:

To redeem in Settings app:

1. Make sure you‚Äôre signed in with the Microsoft account you want to use or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership.  
2. Press the Xbox guide button to open the guide.  
3. Select: Settings &gt; All settings &gt; Account. (There is no All Settings so I go to Account)  
4. In Account, select Included with this Xbox. (Doesn't exist, so I tried Subscriptions, still doesn't exist)  
5. Select: Xbox All Access, then select Claim it.

The menu options to Claim don't appear and I don't see it listed under Subscriptions.

I contacted Microsoft first who confirmed my Serial # does not have the Game Pass Ultimate associated with it and referred me to the Retailer (Amazon).

2 hrs on the phone and they can't decide what to do but suggest best option is setup a full return.

My question is, how does this affect the monthly subscription, and furthermore, the line of credit with Citizens One? Do they cancel the existing one and I have to reapply? Does that affect my credit? Or do they use the existing one and still charge me but I'm out full 24 months dealing with this return stuff.

Any advice appreciated, Thanks in advance.",2,1585111491,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fokcat/xbox_all_access_issue_no_game_pass_ultimate/,xboxone,1

Almost every time, maybe 8 out of 10, I turn the unit on it will not connect to online services and will not let me sign in. It will time on in the ""signing in"" tab. 

When I run connection tests they all come back in the green.

Any downloaded app or game I attempt to open will go to the app's loading screen then after a few moments kick me back out to the home screen. 

The only remedy is to hard reset my console. Once I do this and turn the system back on everything is fine. I can play normally and have no other problems.

I have reset the console to the router, tried wired/wireless connections and have factory reset the console. The issue persists whether the console shuts it self off or I manually turn it off through the menu.

foadey,92ollie92,"Players of Warzone, do you think crossplay is fair play ?","Hello fellow gamers,


I am playing the new Warzone when I can, however on Xbox you CAN'T turn off crossplay.

Why are XBOX players in huge disatvantage ?

Well, crossplay is a really good idead...on paper.
Playing with PS and PC players is just forging the playerbase into one big community. However, there is a twist : PC players. Playing with M+K, on a 144hz monitor against a guy on XBOX ONE S with controller. How is this even possible ???

Crossplay should mean xbox and ps and maybe PC players with controller. Controller players vs MK players are not in the same league.

Why is Activision ignoring it ?

- PC players are just fine with it, killing console players is easy.
- on PS you can turn off the crossplay and can get into the lobby where only PS players are joining in
-XBOX ? Crossplay is forced, can't play without it.

Getting killed constantly by PC players just killed my hype in the game :/

The right thumbstick on my elite series 1 seems to have stick drift now. It is about 4 years old so it is well out of warranty. I've tried to reach out to Microsoft but it seems their support isn't reachable at this time. Might be virus related. Not sure what they'd be able to do for me anyway.

I'd really like to get this controller repaired.  I've watched a few videos and even gave it a shot myself (it's out of warranty anyway). The fixes I tried didn't seem to work and I don't feel comfortable with trying anything further. I'm looking for a professional.  My question is are there any companies (or people) that could fix this issue?

Appreciate any help I can get!",1,1585071886,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fo9eqy/xbox_one_elite_series_1_controller_stick_drift/,xboxone,1

1. Settings / general / personalisation / theme &amp; motion / activate smooth transition

2. Settings / general / personalisation / color &amp; background / Transparency / Make sure to put home panels &amp; tiles to SOLID

(Transparency is known to use more ram and so slow down the system)

 - Remove custom Background  
     -‚àÜ Free ram for the rest of the system

3. Make sure to have at least 100 gigs free on your hard drive
 - Too much data slows the loading time

Extra ; if you have an SSD install all games on it. This will keep the Hard drive healthy and make all the loading games loading time a LOT faster ‚àÜ

fo30lm,SenileTomato,Best Rechargeable Batteries for Xbox One Controllers?,"I have been reading all over the net that Panasonic's Eneloop Re-Chargeable AA Batteries are the best bet, but what I haven't determined is if it is the 2,000 mAh or 2,550 mAh models (Regular vs the pros, respectively). Does anyone have any personal experience with either, or preferably both? 

It would appear that if I went with the 2,000 mAh, I would be getting a much better deal. They claim to hold up to 85% charge after  5 years and have 2,100 recharge cycles, while the 2,550 mAh models (the pros) have (roughly) only 500 cycles, and hold up to 85% charge after just 1 year.

I also like the idea,of having actual AA batteries for two reasons. 1. They can be reused for any application that takes AA batteries! 2. Every rechargeable battery specifically designed for Xbox One controllers, in my vast experience with them, has either had issues with charging the battery, holding charge, or quality control issues as a whole (even Microsoft and Energizer brand battery packs). Therefore, I will stay away from them.

Correct me if any of my information is wrong, of you do, please cite your proof.

fo1y7p,Secret-Lecture,"If for an extra $50, MS could upgrade the Series X to an 3.8gb/s ssd, 20gb of ram and a bigger power supply to allow the gpu to clock at 2ghz, should they?","The Series X is a fantastic device, this is all theoretical.

But say that it would cost MS $15 to upgrade the ssd to a 3.8gb/s ssd (much closer to the PS5‚Äôs SSD speed) 

And say it would cost them $15 to upgrade to 20gb of ram 

And say it would cost them $20 to upgrade to a higher watt power supply and higher speed fan that would supply enough power to clock the gpu at 2ghz to make it a 14TF console (the ps5 gpu is clocked at 2.3ghz).

Would you happily pay an extra $50 for the Series X if it came with those upgrades over the announced specs?

Would Microsoft be making a mistake spending an extra $50 per unit to make those three upgrades to ensure the Series X remains superior to both the PS5 and to most gaming PCs in every single respect?

If you could only pick one of those 3 upgrades, which would you pick? I would go with the faster SSD to ensure that we never have an open world game that constantly reuses assets so the whole level looks the same, or cuts you off from sections of the level and requires elevator sections or door opening animations to access them ever again.

As an owner of both a PS4 and Xbox One S I by far prefer the Xbox controller setup because:

A) I buy a rechargeable battery pack for ¬£10 and I'm sorted, no faffing about with AAs 
(something none of the media commenters seem to know about given the common complaints about AAs running out, makes me question their knowledge if they don't use a basic piece tech that I've used since I got my 1st preowned 360)

and

B) Having owned multiple PS4 controllers both official and Xbox-shaped licensed controllers, i have yet to have one that hasn't developed issues charging properly off my PS4 or a charger.

So the way I see it with Xbox i can simply replace a ¬£10 battery pack if ive an issue, which ive never had, whilst with PS4 controllers i have to pretty much keep them charging when in use for any length of time or buy a new ¬£40-¬£50 controller....

I kept hearing this game was gonna get a port to the Xbox One like many other beloved classics of the 360 era, but it never seemed to make the cut I noticed. Now I know well that the last of the ports were done recently and they were gonna stop on the projects for now for the brand new generation of gaming ahead of us after the Xbox One generation, and I've read they aren't entirely done with the backwards compatibility updates.   


This was a game ironically I didn't play during its release year cause I actually hadn't even gotten a 360 yet, It wasn't until long after the release years down the road my brother picked it up on Steam and showed it to me that I got interested, that point in time I had my Xbox One and 360 still plugged in and sat there for ""Just in cases"" I ever couldn't find an old 360 game I wanted to play but couldn't play on Xbox One...and well, Dust literally made me ""Dust"" off my 360 and pick up the controller again when I bought it and I pretty much played that game thoroughly through to 100% completion, Yeah I will fully acknowledge the game has its flaws in story and plot lines, and it is pretty easy unless you put it on the hardest to second to hardest difficulty. **BUT,** I just adored it.   


The art style was beautifully  done and eye catching, the gameplay was rather simple but fun, your adorable Nimbat sidekick Fidget with you the entire way spouting references to many other classic games and just being a total goof, Your stoic conflicted anime style protagonist Dust and his magic talking blade Ahrah, I just...I dunno, it was a really magical gem of a game to dig up way after its prime in the old 360 arcade and I'd love to play it all over again on XB1 since my 360 is pretty much on its last legs after a lot of good use out of it.  I'd be very happy if they ever gave it an updated backwards compatibility update one day in the future.",6,1585034132,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fo0uak/backwards_compatibility_suggestions_dust_an/,xboxone,1

This means that millions of people are at home either under self isolation or lockdown with little or nothing to do unless they are working at home.   


XBL is a great social platform for millions of people like myself who suffer from problems like social anxiety. Having people on the other end of a headset or having my mind placed at some ease through playing games with others online has been a wonder for me &amp; probably millions of others over the years.  There is no doubt that over the next 3-6 months that self isolation &amp; lockdown procedures will take it's toll on people. Can Xbox (and PS for that matter) ease the burden by releasing XBL to be free to everyone during this time?   This is only my thoughts but I think it would be a great idea and would be a massive benefit to people &amp; Xbox for that matter in showing that they are doing what they can on their end to help people through this unprecedented situation.",5,1585031975,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fo0ge3/just_a_thought_should_xbox_live_be_free_for_the/,xboxone,1

I am considering buying a Series X as well as a PS5, I really want Microsoft to continue making Halo games

What gives? Why are the One controllers so fragile and prone to breaks when the 360s could probably take a wall throw and still work? It's not just durability either, it's the feel and components too. The One controllers i've had have all felt cheap and hollow, and the battery compartment feels like a huge step backward compared to the 360 packs.

Is there any decently reliable Xbox One controller out there worth getting, or maybe one designed like the 360 controllers?

It‚Äôs barely a year and half old, it has run fine up until about 3 weeks ago when we moved what room it is in. Previously it was in the main living room, then it got moved to my room, both about equal distance from the router/modem. 
We have Xfinity WiFi, it isn‚Äôt great but it hasn‚Äôt been a problem in the past. I recently have been trying to play Minecraft, just join my friends world. Not even join Realms or Hypixel or anything, just join a LAN world. 
I ran the Stats and Speed test, it came back at 49% PL, 57% PL, 34% PL, and finally 55% PL. 
it never had this problem before and I am pissed. I spoke to the Web Chat thing on the Microsoft website, not really the best results, didn‚Äôt do much to help. 
I usually get signed out of Xbox Live constantly, I sign in and within 30 seconds to a minute I‚Äôm kicked out. This started around the same time and for a while I fixed it by resetting the modem/router but that doesn‚Äôt help anymore.
Sometimes, like earlier in the day today it worked perfectly fine for multiple hours on end, never a problem but it also took over an hour of wrestling it before it stabilized to where I could even sign in.

fny9xs,provenflipper,Help diagnosing dead Xbox One X,"Three days ago, I attempted to play Star Wars Jedi Knight. I haven‚Äôt used my Xbox in about 3 months or so. When I turned it on, there were errors related to an update and it wouldn‚Äôt complete the update. I chalked it off to maybe servers being over loaded and was able to play the game for a bit. 

I was getting some weird loading slowdowns/glitches and eventually it froze. I was over it and just turned it off. The next day I decided to try again. This time, my XOX wouldn‚Äôt boot at all. I tried over and over again before moving it to a different TV with a different HDMI, controller and power cable. The fans come on, but I get nothing on the screen, no signal detected by the TV. 

I was finally able to get it to kind of boot up, the boot sequence was extremely laggy and the audio was choppy and took forever to get through. Finally got to the green Xbox One screen and after a few mins it went to a black screen and has never booted since. 

All of this makes me believe the hard drive died on it. The research I‚Äôve done talks about a recovery screen that is accessed by holding bind and eject and turning the console on. I can‚Äôt get this to pop up and I‚Äôve tried at least 20-30 times. 

I‚Äôm confident that I can swap the HDD out myself, I just want to know that a new HDD will solve the problem before spending the money on one and doing all of the work. I‚Äôm quite frustrated because this is a launch Scorpio edition, but I‚Äôve probably only put 100-150 hours on this console.

Now Corona Virus is hitting hard and we are all secluded without option I think it's fair to ask for Microsoft to give free access to a good amount of games. What better opportunity that giving free Game Pass subscription?
I think in this dark moment big companies need to support people instead of the other way around.  I haven't had the chance to put money in my bank account before they did the lock down in my country (Spain) and I can't even purchase Game Pass even if I wanted.

This would be a very nice measure to thank our fidelity along the years as we (everyone that buys Microsoft or Xbox product) are who spent our money and contributed to the success of the company.

fnvato,Maerialist,Tech problem: Controllers disconnecting.,"I am very not tech savvy in this department so hopefully someone here knows more than I do.

The batteries are fine, I‚Äôve replaced them a few times. 

My thought is that the wireless controllers are somehow not reaching the console, but there is nothing obstructing the controller/console, and the new console is in the same location at the Xbox 360 was in and I never had that problem with those wireless controllers.

First, the only thing I play is Halo, but I don't know what's going on, they've had the same problem the last week, that you can't see your friends, and you can't join a party.

What I mean is that this week I have had about 3 times more latency (ping) in halo than in the past week. So I would like to know if it is the xbox servers in general, or is my internet provider the one that is saturated and is generating more latency for me to play online. I try reset my internet and nothing changes. This happened to me too about 3 days ago BEFORE the servers started to crash.

For example, I was using a banshee and about 3 over 5 of my shots, they were not being launched :(

I live in Mexico, close to Mexico City, I have maybe the fastest internet of my town but I still can't play well with so much ping.

fnous1,URexposed2propaganda,Xbox Elite Controller 2 runaway right stick.,"So while I love my Xbox One X, I have gone through at least 10-12 controllers since the Xbox One released. I even had the original Elite Controller which lasted about a year before the grips fell apart and the d-pad went wonky. Since then I was sort of making do with all the collectable controllers that were lying around, but all had sticky buttons or triggers. 

I looked at the Razer Wolverine for a bit and was really enticed by the clicky buttons, but the lack of wireless was a deal-breaker. Since the basic controllers failed the test of time, like an idiot, I decided to plump for the reassuringly expensive Elite 2, because I had figured that since Microsoft had revised the controller, they might have ironed out any issues with the latest one. 

NOPE. 

I'm about 2 weeks into the lifespan of the latest elite, and in FPS games my character starts moving forward randomly, without input. In in-game menus, the highlighted option cycles from option to option without input. Frankly I want a refund, but Microsoft has no customer support for the Elite 2 other than those silly troubleshooting guides that tell me to take out the battery (can't remove the battery from the Elite 2). Besides feeling stupid, I feel ripped off. I don't think I will buy another Microsoft controller when the Series X arrives and will opt for a third party. 

PS. I am not violent with my controller ever, always keep it somewhere it can't drop or fall, so I take good care of it. 

Does anyone know how I can get these guys to take their crappy product back? Or can you suggest a third party controller that is reliable and not $200?

fnmk9d,Viperaaspis,SSD vs TFLPs,"Since Sony's presentation we can hear left and right how now teraflops means nothing. Only an ultra fast SSD matters. 

I am not an expert, but from our experience NVIDIA isn't building SSDs. They are right now King of GPUs. If you want to run a game at its ultimate level, you need the highest NVIDIA card.  

If we would listen to all what we hear now, you could basically buy a medium GPU card and combined it with the future and not yet available ultra SSD and beat any card on today's market and future.

So TFLPS and raw GPU power are very important too. Plus all the optimisation put in place and the software in the machine and given to the developers are of high importance will make the difference. 

Don't get me wrong, this SSD is a wonder. It is pushing tech to the next level.  

Is Xbox Series X better than the PS5? They are different philosophies. 

The market is what it is. There are more PS4s sold than Xboxs. A lot of people invested their money in their Playstation libraries and they are not keen to let that go. Microsoft knows that and thanks to Xbox Game pass and the upcoming Xcloud they are building a new market.

Let us not forget that the biggest gaming market is PC and not consoles. Not many PCs will have that ultra fast SSD from Sony. Therefore developers will build their third party games tailored to that PC-market without the ultra SSD in mind.

Only Sony's first party games will see all the benefits of that tech. 

Sony is a great company. They have been with us tech enthusiasts since our childhood. From the Sony walkman (the amazing yellow one which could go under water), MDs, cameras, TVs,consols, Blu Rays and so on. 

Their exclusive games are fantastic. They know how to market a game and build an exclusive game.

On that front, Microsoft is also ready.",9,1584979927,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fnmk9d/ssd_vs_tflps/,xboxone,1

fnmjnr,Kieffer899,Original Xbox One makes faint sound and attempts to turn on... But doesn't.,"Hello all, first time poster here!

So, I have an original Xbox one. Yesterday I unplugged the whole set up(power brick and unit) to bring down to the basement to see how it looked on the new TV I got down there... It worked great! My wife wanted to play the switch so I unplugged the set up and brought it back upstairs to figure out how I was going to lay things out down there eventually. I plugged everything back to where it originally was, hit the power button.... Nothing. I hit it a couple more times... Nothing but a really faint sound like it was attempting to turn on,it was like a really faint/dying attempt of a start up sound. 

Of course I flew to Xbox support to see the steps I'm supposed to take and tried everything they had suggested, and it just simply won't turn on. It's as if it's just not getting enough juice to kick it on. (the brick has a steady orange LED to it, not white like it's supposed to be). The final suggestion on there was basically ""you'll need to buy a new one"" 

I've seen other people order a new power supply, so I am waiting on a new one to see if this will solve the problem... But I have other questions... Let's say if it is, in fact, dead and there's no saving it...

1. Stuff saved onto the actual hard drive... Is there any possible way to get that off and onto another system? Is it something that I can open it up and get the data transferred? 

2. There's still a disc in there... Short of smashing it, how would I go abiut getting that out.

I‚Äôve noticed one time ,that if I leave the Division 2 idle for about a half hour or so the entire Xbox one x turns off. It‚Äôs definitely not something in the Xbox settings, is the only game that does that while being idle.Second time it shutted off when loading game on 14%.  


During gameplay no problem.  


It just shuts down,like pressing power button to off. And not any overheating message. Working fine again.  


Also after shutdown there was not any error message,or any overheating message.

fnlmpa,KingToothpaste,Is the Xbox One X worth the upgrade despite not having a 4K tv?,"Here‚Äôs a bit of background information. I‚Äôve been rocking the og Xbone since ~December 2015. Hardly any physical problems with it (other than it not wanting to shut off from time to time), but it leaves more to be desired. I also play on a 1080p 60hz Fluid TV.

500gb is hardly enough storage for me, and hasn‚Äôt really allowed me to make the most of game pass. Game loading speeds aren‚Äôt the best, and theres the occasional frame drops that are to be expected. Having the clunky power box attached toi the console isn‚Äôt really all that great either.

What I‚Äôve been considering is selling my Nintendo Switch (which has mostly been collecting dust) alongside it‚Äôs games to help offset the cost of the X. I would be handing off my current xbox to my parents to become a media device for Disney+ and other streaming apps.

So in your opinion, is this a reasonable idea? Would it still be a good idea considering I don‚Äôt have a display capable of matching the resolution or frame rates the X supports?

fnjtb1,gunsmyth,Quality of life improvement for the screen saver achievement banner.,"I had a large external HD, I like to have every game available to play. I also use the Kinect regularly for recording game clips, turning off the Xbox, and changing between games, it's very convenient when you have a very large number of installed games. 

However sometimes the Kinect just doesn't hear what you said, or maybe the Kinect command isn't what you expect (looking at you PUBG) so it opens the wrong game. No big deal, it takes a couple seconds to manually load the right game or try another command.

The quantity of life improvement would be for the achievement banner that shows on screen while the Xbox has been issue for a while will show the next achievement for the game I accidentally opened, which might be some games with gold game I've never actually played. Maybe what determines what shows up there is a combination of time played and how recently it was opened.

I always saw them as games that just made you go to the part of the map by making you travel to make the game last longer. 

Over the last few years though I have drifted towards open world games. I liked watch dogs 2. I fell in love with RDR 2. I just explored that game and did everything. Was amazing. 

I just find open world games to be more immersive and being able to choose if you want to do a side mission or main mission or even just explore is great.

I like to use the headset to play game sounds AND party chat. I‚Äôve tried playing with the settings and can‚Äôt find how to adjust this. I‚Äôve done a lot of the common sense approach and just can‚Äôt make it work so maybe there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing or maybe I‚Äôm just a dumbass (likely.)

There is nothing to be gained over arguing the legitimacy or superiority of the Series X and Ps5 tech specs and bold claims. The amount of nonsense discussion means nobody wins. When false claims, hyperbole, and lies are being made, it is pointless. Even nonsense which stems from a hint of truth, is still nonsense. I'm probably guilty of it myself. 

The saying 'the proof is in the eating of the pudding' is so true. But many of us are taking the ingredients (specs and claims) we've been given and then making our judgements based on those alone; instead of waiting for the pudding i.e. a demonstration of real games made to properly use the new gen technology.

I‚Äôve just bought a new Xbox one Elite series 2 controller and have connected my Astro A10 headset which I previously used on a regular controller (where it worked fine.) and am having issues.

The console is picking up the headset but isn‚Äôt playing any sound except party chat through it.
I like to use the headset to play game sounds AND party chat. I‚Äôve tried playing with the settings and can‚Äôt find how to adjust this. I‚Äôve done a lot of the common sense approach and just can‚Äôt make it work so maybe there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing or maybe I‚Äôm just a dumbass (likely.)

I really appreciate your help as I really want to be able to enjoy my new controller.

Thanks!",4,1584942678,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fnew21/my_mic_wont_play_the_game_sounds/,xboxone,1

fnepf2,_I0NEX_,UI freezing and corrupted Minecraft world - Xbox One S,"I was playing Minecraft on my Xbox one S and I was in a party with 1 other friend, the party stopped working but didn't say disconnected or connecting so I left the party and started a new one so I could invite him, as soon as I sent the invite my consoles UI froze, my controller had no input and holding the Xbox button on the controller wouldn't bring up the shutdown menu, I had a kbm plugged in and so I could use the windows button to close the ui and go back to Minecraft, but then upon reopening it it froze with the previous ui menu on screen so I had to hold the power button and close the console, now my Minecraft world which I have been playing on for days is gone so I'm thinking it somehow corrupted and caused an issue within Xbox and now it won't show up coz it's a dead file?

From what I gathered, they don't touch the game code at all. So what is that process like exactly, and is making these enhancements time consuming despite not having to touch the game code?   


Saints Row 2, as great as it is, is by far the worst looking game I've played on my 4k tv, even compared to other non-enhanced back compat titles -- and I'm not one to obsess over graphics. If any game deserved a patch, it's this one. It makes me wonder, are certain games (such as Saints row 2) incapable of being X Enhanced? I really want to see what the Series X can do for this game.

Here's what I know, and what I have tried thus far:

\-This appears to be an isolated issue. I can't seem to find any resources online as to why this is the only game on my xbox that causes this problem. 

\- I have tried a hard reset on the xbox with no success, and problem persists exactly as it always had. 

\- I have tried putting the xbox in energy saving mode, although I was certain initially that it wasn't an issue with overheating. 

\-I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game multiple times. 

\- I have removed the entirety of the modern warfare software on my xbox and downloaded the free version of ONLY Warzone available in the xbox store. This caused the exact seem issue as before (ie. Freezes at exact same point and shuts off xbox completely).

\- I asked a friend of mine to sign in on my account and see if my version of Warzone works on his console.

\- This is clearly an issue with the xbox. 

My question is, what is it about this game in particular that makes my xbox shit the bed completely????????

I searched this sub and all over the net to find a way to solve this. I tried clearing the cache, hard resets, uninstalling/reinstalling and other suggestions, but none of them worked. I found out that others here have had the same problem, and have not found a solution. I've heard multiple people say that Microsoft Support have not been helpful and that Microsoft still hasn't figured out a solution on their end.  


I was even having an incredibly difficult time contacting Xbox One Support about this, but today I found a way and got through to an fantastic support rep.

**I removed my account, restarted, and added it again by going to Sign In- Add New and putting in my account info. It worked! Funny thing is that the support worker seemed as relieved as I was- she wasn't sure if it would work.**

I followed the recommended YouTube videos that are passed around here often. I did a ""pea size"" dab of paste, not too much. I did some new 2mm square thermal pads on the VRAM where the originals used to be.

The box actually blasts the fan even louder now. It just takes off. And then shuts down immediately. It's worse than before. I've taken it apart twice now, redone the thermal paste twice, double-checked the pads. The clamp has the sink down nice and tight. Everything is making contact.

What's going on? It's out of warranty, it'd cost me $250 to send it in. This should be an easy fix. I'm not new to thermal paste, I build PCs, I've repaired stuff before. This is confusing the hell out of me.

I just spoke with a supervisor over at Microsoft Support. They told me my situation was an unlucky series of event that SHOULD NOT have occurred. Because my card expired, it complicated the issue to locking my account for 60 days. The ultimatum that was offered to me (either pay $56 or wait 2 months) was only offered because the representative I spoke with was not aware of a third option that the supervisor instead recommends for people caught up in this situation: they asked I pay the $56 on another card, call back and state I want a refund, and then both the lock will be lifted and the funds will return to my account. It's a system issue, but a known and preventable one nonetheless.


Dear everyone who downvoted me on my first post disagreeing with me with what I thought was a malpractice on MS' end: Congratulations. You have either 1) the hive mind sheep mentality that thinks MS is always right because they made Halo for you growing up and that made your child vewy special and/or 2) the critical thinking skills of a second grader.

Developers will be able to deliver incredibly immersive visual and audio experiences using the same techniques on PC and beyond.

&gt;[The Science Behind Raytracing (explained by Disney)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLwRLS_ZR0)


[**Project Acoustics**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIzwo-MxCC8)
-
*Incubated over a decade by Microsoft Research, Project Acoustics accurately models sound propagation physics in mixed reality and games, employed by many AAA experiences today. It is unique in simulating wave effects like diffraction in complex scene geometries without straining CPU, enabling a much more immersive and lifelike auditory experience. Plug-in support for both the Unity and Unreal game engines empower the sound designer with expressive controls to mold reality. Developers will be able to easily leverage Project Acoustics with Xbox Series X through the addition of a new custom audio hardware block.*

&gt;[The Science Behind The Tech](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/acoustics/what-is-acoustics)

[**Spatial Audio**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-ZqYdw7f14)
-
*Spatial Audio delivers deeply immersive audio which enables the player to more accurately pinpoint objects in a 3D play space. With full support for Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and Windows Sonic, Xbox Series X has custom audio hardware to offload audio processing from the CPU, dramatically improving the accessibility, quality and performance of these immersive experiences.*

[**Quick Resume**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S82YvCtwfHY)
-
*A new feature powered by the technical capabilities and the innovative Xbox Velocity Architecture in Xbox Series X, Quick Resume enables players to seamlessly switch between multiple titles and resume instantly from where you last left off.*

**Variable Rate Shading (VRS)**
-
*Variable Rate Shading increases GPU efficiency by concentrating shader work where it‚Äôs most needed and reducing shader work in areas where it won‚Äôt be noticeable. With minimal developer effort, VRS significantly improves GPU performance resulting in more stable and higher resolutions and frame rates with no perceptible loss in visual quality.*

&gt;[The Science Behind VRS \(explained by Marting Fuller\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vKnKba0wxk)


[**Variable Refresh Rate**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sP6H1lK6XI)
-
*Variable Refresh Rate is a new addition to HDMI 2.1 which enables capable displays to refreshed as fast as the console can render images, thereby eliminating tearing, increasing smoothness, and reducing latency. We have been working with the industry‚Äôs leading TV manufacturers to ensure the display ecosystem is ready for the features we are bringing with Xbox Series X.*



**Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM)**
-
*As part of commitment to responsiveness for the next generation of console gaming, Xbox Series X supports Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) with capable displays. ALLM automatically enables your display‚Äôs lowest latency mode when you start playing. This functionality exists on Xbox One consoles today*

**DirectML**
-
*Xbox Series X supports Machine Learning for games with DirectML, a component of DirectX. DirectML leverages unprecedented hardware performance in a console, benefiting from over 24 TFLOPS of 16-bit float performance and over 97 TOPS (trillion operations per second) of 4-bit integer performance on Xbox Series X. Machine Learning can improve a wide range of areas, such as making NPCs much smarter, providing vastly more lifelike animation, and greatly improving visual quality.*

[**DirectStorage**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ElKuyZPJg)
-
*DirectStorage is an all new I/O system designed specifically for gaming to unleash the full performance of the SSD and hardware decompression. It is one of the components that comprise the Xbox Velocity Architecture. Modern games perform asset streaming in the background to continuously load the next parts of the world while you play, and DirectStorage can reduce the CPU overhead for these I/O operations from multiple cores to taking just a small fraction of a single core; thereby freeing considerable CPU power for the game to spend on areas like better physics or more NPCs in a scene. This newest member of the DirectX family is being introduced with Xbox Series X and we plan to bring it to Windows as well.*

**Dynamic Latency Input (DLI)**
-
*Another innovation we are making to reduce latency for Xbox Series X is Dynamic Latency Input (DLI). With DLI, developers can more accurately synchronize the player‚Äôs input with the game‚Äôs simulation and render loop, even further reducing input latency while playing the game.*

**GPU Work Creation**
-
*Xbox Series X adds hardware, firmware and shader compiler support for GPU work creation that provides powerful capabilities for the GPU to efficiently handle new workloads without any CPU assistance. This provides more flexibility and performance for developers to deliver their graphics visions.*

**Hardware Decompression**
-
*Hardware decompression is a dedicated hardware component introduced with Xbox Series X to allow games to consume as little space as possible on the SSD while eliminating all CPU overhead typically associated with run-time decompression. It reduces the software overhead of decompression when operating at full SSD performance from more than three CPU cores to zero ‚Äì thereby freeing considerable CPU power for the game to spend on areas like better gameplay and improved framerates. Hardware decompression is one of the components of the Xbox Velocity Architecture.*

[**Intelligent Delivery**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBw30bs4eC0)
-
*Microsoft‚Äôs developer facing technology to reduce the size of game installs. Intelligent Delivery empowers developers to only install the pieces of the game you need, thereby minimizing the amount of content that needs to be installed or downloaded to the SSD.*

**Latency**
-
*Latency refers to responsiveness of the console and controller, including the time it takes for your input to be registered by your console and then displayed on your screen. Reducing latency results in a more connected and immersive experience. Xbox Series X will be our most responsive console ever featuring ultra-low latency with advanced technology that minimizes latency at every stage of the gaming pipeline so that you instantly see the impact of your actions on the screen.*

[**Mesh Shading**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRfZYJ_sk5E)
-
*Mesh shading will enable developers to dramatically improve the performance and image quality when rendering a substantial number of complex objects in a scene. As an example, mesh shaders could enable the player to experience asteroid belts and fields of flowers in more pristine detail without seeing a loss in performance.*

&gt;[The Science Behind The Tech (explained by Christoph Kubisch)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72lYVTlPfI8)

**Native Resolution**
-
*Native Resolution is an Xbox Series X backwards compatibility enhancement for select Xbox One games that allows them to render at native 4K even if they weren‚Äôt originally designed for 4K.*

**Optimized for Xbox Series X**
-
*Games built using the Xbox Series X development kit and designed to take advantage of the unique capabilities of the Xbox Series X. These include new titles built natively using the Xbox Series X development environment as well as previously released titles that have been rebuilt specifically for Xbox Series X. They will showcase unparalleled load-times, visuals, responsiveness and framerates up to 120 fps.*

**Parallel Cooling Architecture**
-
*Parallel Cooling Architecture is the name of the innovative system design used to cool Xbox Series X. Building a console that delivers four times the processing power of Xbox One X in the most quiet and efficient way ‚Äì something that is critically important with all the extra power of our next generation console ‚Äì led to its unique vertical design.*

**RDNA 2**
-
*The custom designed processor in the Xbox Series X leverages RDNA 2, the latest next generation graphics architecture from our partners at AMD. RDNA 2 provides a significant advancement in performance and efficiency as well as next generation graphics features such as hardware accelerated raytracing and variable rate shading.*

**Sampler Feedback Streaming (SFS)**
-
*A component of the Xbox Velocity Architecture, SFS is a feature of the Xbox Series X hardware that allows games to load into memory, with fine granularity, only the portions of textures that the GPU needs for a scene, as it needs it. This enables far better memory utilization for textures, which is important given that every 4K texture consumes 8MB of memory. Because it avoids the wastage of loading into memory the portions of textures that are never needed, it is an effective 2x or 3x (or higher) multiplier on both amount of physical memory and SSD performance.*


&gt;[The Science Behind Sampler Feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7AG23s2_AM)



**SDR to HDR Conversion**
-
*With Xbox Series X, existing Xbox games, including recent titles within the ID@Xbox program, that don‚Äôt already have native HDR support will get the next-gen treatment. Xbox Series X is able to leverage an innovative HDR reconstruction technique to enhance existing SDR games with no work from developers and no impact to available CPU, GPU or memory resources.*

[**Smart Delivery**](https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x-smart-delivery)
-
*Smart Delivery is a new technology introduced with Xbox Series X that will ensure you always play the best version of the games you own for your console, across generations. All Xbox Game Studios titles that are optimized for Xbox Series X, including ‚ÄúHalo Infinite‚Äù will support Smart Delivery, providing the best available version for whichever console you choose to play on. For example, this means if you purchase the Xbox One version of a supported title, we will identify and deliver the best version of it to your Xbox One, as usual. If you decide to jump into the next generation with Xbox Series X, we will automatically provide the Xbox Series X optimized version of the game at no additional cost if and when it becomes available. Smart Delivery is available to all Xbox developers.*


**TFLOPS (Teraflops)**
-
*TFLOPS (or ‚Äúteraflops‚Äù) stands for Trillion Floating-point Operations Per Second and is a measure of raw mathematical performance of a GPU. While Xbox Series X delivers 12 TFLOPS of 32-bit float performance, two times that of the Xbox One X, the architectural efficiency improvements brought by AMD‚Äôs RDNA 2 architecture plus our next generation features such as Variable Rate Shading (VRS) and hardware accelerated DirectX Raytracing means that Xbox Series X will deliver well over twice the effective graphics performance of Xbox One X for games.*

**Xbox Series X Storage Expansion Card**
-
*Built in partnership with Seagate, this 1 TB custom storage solution expands storage capacity of Xbox Series X with the full speed and performance of the Xbox Velocity Architecture Previous generation Xbox titles can still be played directly from external USB 3.2 hard drives. However, to receive all the benefits of the Xbox Velocity Architecture and optimal performance, Xbox Series X, optimized games should be played from the internal SSD or Xbox Series X Storage Expansion Card.*

**Xbox Velocity Architecture**
-
*The Xbox Velocity Architecture is the new architecture we‚Äôve created for the Xbox Series X to unlock new capabilities never-before seen in console development. It consists of four components: our custom NVMe SSD, a dedicated hardware decompression block, the all new DirectStorage API, and Sampler Feedback Streaming (SFS). This combination of custom hardware and deep software integration allows developers to radically improve asset streaming and effectively multiply available memory. It will enable richer and more dynamic living worlds unlike anything ever seen before. It also effectively eliminates loading times, and makes fast travel systems just that: fast.*

**Xbox Wireless Protocol**
-
*One of the first points to reduce latency is within the communication between your controller and your console. By bringing our existing high-bandwidth, low-latency wireless protocol on the Xbox One family of devices to Xbox Series X, we‚Äôre able to not only reduce latency in your gaming experience but also ensure all of your existing Xbox One gaming accessories will be compatible with Xbox Series X.*

**Zen 2**
-
*The custom designed processor in the Xbox Series X leverages AMD‚Äôs latest Zen 2 CPU architecture. Zen 2 provides a significant advancement in CPU performance delivering more than 4 times the performance of an Xbox One X.*

**120 FPS**
-
*With support for up to 120 frames per second (FPS), Xbox Series X allows developers to exceed the more traditional 60 FPS in favor of heightened realism and more precise controls for fast-paced action.*

fn4lqr,SOxST34LTH,Xbox Elite Controller 2 Repair (HELP),"I am having the absolute worst of the worst times repairing my elite controller. Background; I‚Äôve had an elite controller since the series 1. My first one broke twice under warranty through Xbox and I was able to return it until it was out of warranty then I had to purchase a new one. I bought a new after that and purchased Best Buy‚Äôs geek squad protection with it. Great plan, if it breaks, I bring it in and swap it. I used that plan 5 times over the span of 2 years. Elite series 2 came out so I was hoping for more durability and purchased it on the first day still with the Geeksquad Protection. Since then it broke in January due to the LB &amp; RB buttons not clicking/double clicking and I returned it through Geeksquad and now the right stick won‚Äôt click and has drifting issues. The issue this time is Best Buy is out of stock and can‚Äôt even order them to replace my controller. Since this issue came about, I thought hey it‚Äôs under Microsoft warranty let me go through them. I tried every which way to get in contact with a representative to see if I was able to prepay for one to be shipped to me first then return the broken one and have the money returned on the card (I‚Äôve done this twice before) and there‚Äôs no possible way to contact anyone. No online chat agent, no over the phone agents for repairs, and no Microsoft store open due to coronavirus. So hey after all that, whatever, I‚Äôll go through this coronavirus without playing at all without a controller. I‚Äôll sit at home and look at my Xbox. I go online and try to set up a repair and the repair and service site freezes every single time I get to the payment for expedited shipping screen. This is quite possibly the worst thing I‚Äôve ever experienced. I‚Äôve had an Xbox since 2006 and this might be worse than when I had 3 Xbox 360s sitting with ROD in my closet in 2008.

Personally I still think it‚Äôs a great pro-consumer move. Third party developers will likely be doing this anyway for 1-2 years (we saw this on 360/PS3 to Xone/PS4) and it gives Xbox one owners a chance to get a taste of some of the new First party line up from all the new acquisitions, and getting a sequel on the new hardware to really innovate on the first.

Having said that, first party games are where my biggest concern with this policy lies. I would be concerned that some first party developers may not fully utilise the scope afforded by SSD‚Äôs due to HDD‚Äôs of the Xone.

Having said that there is a simple solution. Major ‚Äònext gen‚Äô first party titles are simply given an extra year of development time and released in 2021 for a ‚Äònext gen‚Äô soft launch of sorts where Xbox series X exclusives are allowed.

fn0m90,sosawiltchamberlain,Using Bose QC 35 with Xbox One X,"TLDR: For people who are using QC35s with the controller that came with the Xbox One X, what cable are you using that lets you hear game audio through the headphones and allows you chat with people?

Hello I am trying to use my Bose QC35 II headphones with my xbox for game audio as well as chat and it has been a frustrating process to say the least. First I tried using the cable that came with the headphones and unfortunately it requires you to insert and take out the cable multiple times until the connection works and even then only game audio works. 

I then purchased  [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FQJFM2Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) cable which also did not work as it caused a horrible feedback noise. By the way this cable worked perfectly fine on my computer for audio as well as the microphone.

Then most recently I purchased [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T13D5K7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) cable which does not have any feedback noise but game audio is not coming through the headphones. When I check the audio settings I don't even get the ""headset chat mixer"" setting to adjust the sound. I get this setting even when I plug in my apple headphones to my xbox controller so I don't understand why it isn't showing up for my QC 35s. This cable also works for audio/microphone on my computer.

So does anyone have a cable that they themselves use to hear game audio and chat with people using the QC35s? I appreciate any help.

fn0dj4,Gerzaloub,Extremely shady policy on the part of Microsoft... Can anyone relate?,"TL;DR: I didn't tick off auto-renew on a gamepass trial membership and my account is now locked from using online services until I pay the next billing cycle. Either that, or as I was told by customer support, wait 60 days.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

I don't know if this is the right sub to post on but I'm completely baffled by the chain of events which happened to me recently with respect to my Xbox one...

So, a couple of months ago, a promotion/trial for GamePass was going around for $1 for 3-months. I thought it was a perfect promotion so I purchased it and virtually got 3 months of membership for free. However, fast forward to two days ago, I log on to Microsoft's website and notice my account is ""$56 past due"".

My big fuck-up was that I had not ticked off auto-renew. Additionally, I used a vanilla chase mastercard which didn't have much left on it, so, when the time came that my membership ended and the system wanted to bill me for a new membership, the card used didn't have enough. However, instead of cutting off membership for the next cycle due to a failed payment, they instead opted to continue to give me the Gamepass membership and locking this fee on my account... And I was given 6 free days of Gamepass before I noticed and called Microsoft to try and rectify what was going on. 

I was then told by customer support that I firmly only have 2 options to get this lock lifted- either wait 60 days and the ticket will be resolved on its own, or, pay the $56 for a new Gamepass membership and the lock will be lifted.

In other words, my account OWES $56 to them and not paying this fee will lock any online services for the next 60 days (!!). What in the actual fuck. And when I say lock, I mean that after purchasing a 1-month Xbox live membership code, I was told I need to resolve the issue on my account before I can redeem that code.

All of this because I didn't tick off the auto-renew. I'm kinda at a loss for words with how much they're screwing over customers (customers who actually want to buy a new membership) with this policy. They obviously knew we would be in this position and that the 60 day waiting period is too long for most gamers. This puts such a sour taste in my mouth though that I don't want anything else to do with Xbox ever again...

Asides from raising awareness to you guys, can anybody else suggests a proper and proactive course of action to take next? I don't have many options left asides from waiting the 60 days right?",37,1584885615,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fn0dj4/extremely_shady_policy_on_the_part_of_microsoft/,xboxone,1

fmyu2f,Blank3k,Xbox One - Sharing my games with family?,"I'm not sure on the incracys of how Xbox Live works,

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I have my Xbox One X at my house - I play my games here 90% of the time, alot.

And I have an Xbox One at my parents home - I'm use this on family weekends etc, all my GWG/Purchases etc it all just works no matter whos playing - It has my account + my nieces account on it, the games just work but the xbox its not used unless I'm there so we've never had any issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Corona Isolation is taking over and looking ever more likely we'll be locked down in the next couple of weeks, so i'm probably going to take the spare Xbox to my nieces so she can play games / we can play together etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'll need to hook her up with an XBL Gold Membership, that's fine.

&amp;#x200B;

I presume ""my"" account can only be signed in on one Xbox at a time so the rest of my library wont work for her / I'll be hitting ""Your already signed in!"" messages whenever I try to play games at home?

Is there anyway she can play say one of my GWG games while I play CoD?

&amp;#x200B;

I know Microsoft/Xbox has tons of Family settings etc so I'm not sure if something is possible here.

I'm assuming not and I'll need to just have to bite the bullet / uninstall games to save heartache &amp; just set her account as default so she has nothing and buy her one game as/when but if its possible to atleast have access to my GWG library or something it would be great to know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just checking I'd hate to do that and spend a fortune on games/memberships just to find if I set her as a family member of some sort she could play my games.",6,1584878379,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fmyu2f/xbox_one_sharing_my_games_with_family/,xboxone,1

So i bought the 10$ gift card because i wanted to try the game pass,and one thing lead to another i ended up redeeming the 25 digits code into Microsoft store instead of xbox.

And obviously im unable to purchase the game pass like that. Light googling told me that ive made a mistake.

Is there any way to salvage the situation? Money is not an issue here it just that i dont want to waste money unnecessarily.

And assuming its not possible to do anything abt it,is there anything worthwhile i can do with the already existing 10$ in the Microsoft store account?

fmtix3,VincentDanger,Unpopular opinion: Why I believe certain games (especially halo Infinite) should be delayed and the Xbox series x date should remain the same.,"All launch consoles can sometimes mess up and be very buggy. (Look at the launch of the Xbox one X) this happens all the time in a nutshell. Usually after a month there‚Äôs a patch that fixes all these things. That‚Äôs when the main-title games should release to show the full capability of the series X once when everything is flattened out. Also mind you, we might have some people who might not have the time or money to get launch title games with the Xbox series x or it‚Äôs main title games all at once when it releases.

For those who don‚Äôt know, there‚Äôs been recent news on how halo infinite might get delayed anyways but that shouldn‚Äôt also delay the series x. Let the series X release, wait for the proper patches to be made within a month and like I said release some of the games within the month everything is patched. It would be a good move by Microsoft but I can understand how some people waited for too long for a new main line title halo game or Xbox console. I feel things would be better if was made the way I thought of how it should be made.",21,1584849409,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fmtix3/unpopular_opinion_why_i_believe_certain_games/,xboxone,1

I have a few questions.

1) What caused this error? Was it something I did or no?

2) I looked it up and it seems I might have to factory reset my xbox. What exactly is stored on xbox live? I should be able to get my profile back right? What about games? Also, I just bought a game today and it was downloading, if I can get my games back will that one be remembered? Another note, I have an external drive and about half of my stuff is on there, that should not be affected by resetting the xbox correct?

3) Any tips on fixing the problem without a reset?

fmsxmy,MildGonolini,I am a bit disappointed by how few games are ending up on the PC Microsoft store.,"TL:DR, I would appreciate more AAA releases on the PC Microsoft store, even if the game is also available on steam. 

Apologies for this being so long and rambly. The TL:DR is basically all you need to know. 

I have always been into getting every achievement in a game, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been doing since I had a 360, and to this day I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve truly ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù a game until I‚Äôve gotten every achievement, that, to me, makes me feel like I really got my money‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs at a point where I have really no interest playing a game *unless* I‚Äôm getting achievements for it on my Microsoft account. I sold a Nintendo Switch I bought after about a month recently because I felt like I was wasting my time and that I had no direction on how to complete the game without achievements (I admit this is a fault of my own, I truly envy people who can play a game just to play it). 

Anyway, about a year ago I built a higher end PC, and playing on it is just so much nicer than an Xbox one. Playing a game at 144 FPS 2K is incredible, compared to Xbox where I could at best get 4k 30 FPS or 1080 60 FPS in some games on a one X

The problem is, I find it difficult to play games that don‚Äôt come off the Microsoft store, because those games I actually play with my Microsoft account and can earn achievements that count towards my Xbox profile. This is fantastic, the problem is... there are so few *actual* games on there, and I would love if more were added. There are way too many mobile ports or just like boring puzzle games. I‚Äôve basically finished every AAA game on there, many of which I wouldn‚Äôt have played otherwise, and there is just so few actually being added, that I find more single player new releases I‚Äôm playing on console instead of PC. It also isn‚Äôt like these games are not getting PC releases, most of them end up on steam, but of course I can‚Äôt earn Xbox achievements with steam games (yes Steam has its own achievements system but I‚Äôve amassed like 150 k GS on my Xbox account, so I don‚Äôt want to start all over, I get no motivation to get every achievement on steam games). Doom Eternal for example, just released and I‚Äôm pumped to play it, but I‚Äôm going to have to do so on my Xbox, I would much prefer buying it on PC Microsoft store if given that option. 

I have no idea how difficult it is to actually get games on there in terms of logistics, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs more difficult on the developers end than I give it credit. But, if a game is already releasing on steam and Xbox, is it that difficult for Microsoft to make the PC version available through their PC store? I also understand there‚Äôs probably a small number of people like me who are not content with just getting it off steam. 

I‚Äôm also not talking about the PC game pass, that‚Äôs great and all for what it is, but I‚Äôm happy to pay full price for these games on PC if you give me the chance, I just have very little chance to do so. 

So Microsoft, as I‚Äôm sure you are reading this stupid ramble on reddit and have nothing better to do (that was a joke in case it wasn‚Äôt obvious), I would really appreciate more new releases be available on PC. I personally would be much more inclined to purchase some games on PC that I probably wouldn‚Äôt on Xbox.",0,1584846977,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fmsxmy/i_am_a_bit_disappointed_by_how_few_games_are/,xboxone,1

fmqced,Shrimp_my_Ride,In praise (and defense!) of Doom Eternal,"I know a lot of people are playing this game and enjoying it. I also know some have found various aspects of it lacking. While I actually understand some of the criticism, I am enjoying the hell out of the game and wanted to share some of what I love right here:

&amp;#x200B;

\---

\-I am playing on a launch Xbox and the game runs like butter. It plays very smoothly and I am experiencing virtually no lag or frame rate drop during even the most hectic scenes. Having come off the new Ori game which has some issues, I really appreciated this.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The game looks amazing. Definitely a different look than Doom 2016 but I think that is intentional. I love the saturated colors, the variety of landscapes, the crazy skyboxes with the aftermath of giant demons and mechs fighting. All the attention to detail...and once again looks very good even on a launch Xbox One.

&amp;#x200B;

\-They are definitely going for Destiny levels of lore here. While Doom 2016 kept that stuff optional, it seems like you need to make an effort to follow along with this game. After some hesitancy, I am kind of into it. And honestly if you are not, you can just skip it and run around rip-and-tearing.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I am actually really enjoying the upgrade system. I wholeheartedly agree it should be unified into one system or menu, which would make things easier to keep track of. But the actual process of improving your weapons, armor and character abilities is really fun.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I have seen some complaints about the difficulty, but I feel they make many of the encounters a puzzle and there is usually a ""path"" around each environment to stay mobile. Plus if you die too many times they encourage you to change the difficulty and will even start you with a full set of sentinel armor.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Ammo is limited but that encourages you to switch guns, use the chainsaw (yeah!) and also improves with upgrades.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Just a great variety of guns, mods, enemies and ways to fight.

\---

&amp;#x200B;

I could say so much more, but I need to get back to the game. This is my quarantine game and I am enjoying the heck out it!",9,1584836615,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fmqced/in_praise_and_defense_of_doom_eternal/,xboxone,1

fmpckp,CaptainWaders,XboxOneX fell from a 3 foot ledge. Suggestions on how to take apart and assess the damage.,"My XboxOneX fell from a three foot ledge (while it was turned on) it had an external hard drive connected which seems to be fine.  

The console is actually slightly bent (yea I know) I hear rattling like tiny plastic bbs are inside. 

The console still turns on and appears to run fine. I haven‚Äôt left it on for an extended period of time but it boots up and runs. 

Did I mention it was a scorpio edition? Yeah about that now it‚Äôs thrashed. The finish is nicked and the corner it landed on is smashed in a tad. 

Of course this is just an Xbox and it can be replaced however I was wondering if there is something I should do to maybe take it apart and clean out the plastic that‚Äôs damaged or maybe try to fix whatever got damaged.  

Would you recommend taking it apart and fixing it or just leaving it alone and running it as it is. Maybe it lives forever....maybe it dies tonight. Who knows.  

Guess I have a good reason to upgrade now when the SeriesX comes out. 


Tl;DR 

Xbox fell off of a shelf and now is actually bent slightly and sounds like tiny plastic bbs inside when I move it around.

I was doing some pvp and decided to just go look for groups. I accepted one but never got an invite back. Then I saw another one and decided to accept this one. Same, didnt get an invite. I did this for 30 mins trying to figure out if they just didnt want to play with me for no reason, or they're just really slow at inviting me. My phone starts vibrating and I find out that I had got an invite, but it wasnt showing on the xbox. The weird part is I was playing 6 hours ago with my friends and it was working perfectly, but it now isn't. 

So I now went to check on google if anyone had that same problem. Turns out, someone did. The person who replied said to do Power Cycling. Now I didnt want to take my cable out and mess up anything because I play on my family TV. So I went on youtube and checked  other stuff on power cycling. Everyone said you can do a 'full shutdown'. So, because I was sleepy and desperate, I decided to do it.

fmmhih,hajuen,Game Value Question,"Like so, so, so many other people, I am so excited for the release of the Series X. I'm not someone who typically plans on investing on new models when released, but the backwards compatibility feature has me hooked. While I know Xbox hasn't released a complete list of games that will be compatible, I'm looking for opinions on an idea I have. 

Will games that are dirt cheap now go up in price when the Series X is launched? Would it be a good investment idea to buy any Xbox original (or 360) games while they are currently approx $5 per disc? Or is the backwards compatibility strictly purchasing the games online post-launch? (I'm mostly thinking about games like Assassin's Creed and Skyrim which I currently do not own, but clearly were literal game-changers) 

If I can purchase popular games from previous consoles for low prices now, I could save a ton of money if they do increase in value (I have a lot of games I want to own and a small budget to do so.)",2,1584824523,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fmmhih/game_value_question/,xboxone,1

They are way too grey when it should be black. It's a shame because during the loading screen of the level we see a picture of the outdoors area and black levels and brightness wise that looks superb.

Once ingame it doesn't look like that at all. Why does Capcom do this? They did this in the RE2 demo as well (still haven't bought the game) it honestly makes it look washed out. The only thing that do stand out in HDR are the shop neon lights and signs. After I finished the demo I decided to check out one of those comparison videos, it was in SDR and immediately I saw much proper looking black levels.

The game that truly nailed this was Dead Space back then.",4,1584812345,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/fmira9/those_raised_black_levels_in_resident_evil_3_are/,xboxone,1
fmiqbd,SuperStarlord24,"Xbox, why did u fml for the week?","So basically, me and my friend were playing Apex, and we ran into some very bad people playing. So we decided to troll them. Just like a teenager would do.

And so basically, this guy trolls us back, and so we go into game chat, we troll each other, there are a few cuss words involved. We all leave after the match, and then go to Xbox Messages.  So we troll each other.

 Things get out of hand, and I get com banned. I go and try to reduce, which I do. I stopped messages the guy after that. It got reduced to a 25 minute con ban. I don't use my coms for the rest of the day. At 10:35, I get com banned again.

Go to try and reduce it, it won't let me. Look at the code of conduct, and my thing meet all the requirements. So I just let it go. And so I use discord, and don't break any of the rules. 

6:45 pm, another com ban. Keep in mind I haven't used coms for over 30 hours. It goes until 10:35 tonight. Why has this happened, he did bad stuff and I reported him and nothing has happened to him.
