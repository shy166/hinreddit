And even after me installing a bridged driver the game is unplayable at 12 FPS capped. Now she can't play Doom Eternal.

She tries to get it for the Ps4, but currently all Electronic Stores are closed and the post is working at a snails pace.

She also had a rough month with a lot of work and health issues, looked really forward to today.

Recently my wife and I have been having our front garden and driveway landscaped. This means we‚Äôve had to have soil and stone etc delivered to our house. We had a delivery last week and the delivery driver very carelessly wiped out our telephone cable so now we have no internet and with my wife working from home this is a problem.
We got in touch with British Telecom who said they can fix and they‚Äôll send an engineer out. They came out had a look and said yeah we can fix it but they‚Äôll have to go onto my neighbours property. They knock his door and he refuses point blank to let them work on his property or have the cable go over his garden even though it was originally. My wife tries to reason with him saying she could potentially lose her job but he still refuses. 
Now BT are saying it could be weeks/months before its fixed. So we‚Äôre on lockdown with no internet for the foreseeable future and I know things could be worse but this does suck.

fqa8p5,iFoundWaldo72,Don‚Äôt promise donuts in the apocalypse.,"So here is our nightly donut adventure. I will preface by saying that we have been practicing social distancing for the better part of two weeks now, only leaving to go to the local grocery store - a small Save-A-Lot and once to pick up dinner a local OIP. My wife was excited to hit up Free Donut Friday at Dunkin' today so we promised our daughter a donut if she ate her dinner. Well, she crushed it - so now we had to deliver. We set out on an excursion to the exotic metropolis (neighboring city about 5x larger than the town we live in) 20 minutes south of our little hometown.

We roll into Dunkin' at 6:33 p.m. and it looks eerily empty. I continue through the drive-thru while my wife pulls up Google to check the hours. New hours ‚Üí 6:00 p.m. Shoot. By this time, my daughter is beyond giddy because she knows what Dunkin' is. It's magical. We pull up to a window and a wonderful donut fairy gives us a box of donuts. It's a kid's dream. It's where donuts are made and puppies pounce around. And she's screaming ""dougghh-nuttt, dougghh-nuttt..."" over and over while my wife and I exchange glances. Now what?

So we sit in the parking lot racking our brains on where we can find a donut on a Friday night. Our local convenience gas station? No, they stopped all bakery deliveries. We decide to keep moving.

I pull out of the parking lot and head out toward another neighboring town, thinking of a local donut shop. Google says they're open until 9pm. Sounds promising. My wife proceeds to call this donut shop just to be sure, while by this point, my daughter knows something is up. Now she is screaming, ""I WANT MY DOUGGGHHNUTTTT"". After several rings, we conclude it is not open.

Now we're thinking packaged donuts. At this point, we're in crisis mode. We promised her a donut, now we have to deliver‚Äîeven if it's not a fresh, bakery donut. Perhaps the local gas station will do. By this point, I have turned around and now we are traveling back toward Dunkin'. I was planning on going to a gas station just down the road - but as we approached, we noticed it was under construction. Ahh, we don't need to deal with that; I'll just pull into the next gas station. As we're deciding which Sheetz to go to, I see ""Perkins Restaurant &amp; Bakery"".

I express my new idea of Perkins - it literally has ""bakery"" in it's name, they have to have donuts, right? My wife is skeptical, thinks we should keep moving. My daughter is demanding a donut. I'm parked now, dialing Perkins because now we have to call in all orders for take-out. They answer.

And I discover I called the Perkins an hour away. Shit. Hang up. I call the local Perkins and proceed to order donuts.

""I'm sorry, we don't have donuts.""

""What? You literally have bakery in your name!?""

Okay, so now we're back to square one - but we're on to something. Maybe another breakfast place? If they don't have donuts, we can at least get cookies. My daughter likes cookies. Check the all-knowing Google. They're only open on Saturdays? Why!? Bob Evans? Courtney and I are frantically trying to figure out a donut solution while my daughter is slowly transforming into an angry leprechaun that will only answer to donut. Time was running out.

The local gas station it is. Packaged donuts will have to do. But can we last that long? Maybe we can, maybe we can't. And the same local grocery store that was in our hometown had another location across the street. So we go there, and get packaged donuts.

We ended up going to a small grocery store that we could have went to in our hometown. . .

Well, I decided I was going to get an Orange Julius. I like those. I earned it. So we continue our journey to Dairy Queen.

Hahaha. Don't go there. Seriously. Unless you need a good laugh.

There was a Texas Roadhouse. We‚Äôre they giving out free steaks. Why were there 50 cars there? Why does it look like a tailgate? And the DQ car line...at least 20 cars deep. What is happening?!

We left there pretty quickly. I didn't need an Orange Julius that bad. I had beer at home and THAT I earned. 

So I sit here drinking a cold one, telling you our story in hopes that you can learn from our mistakes. Don't promise donuts in the apocalypse.",1,1585357713,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/fqa8p5/dont_promise_donuts_in_the_apocalypse/,Wellthatsucks,1

fpatzo,Spookyredd,"After 10 years of job searching, my husband finally got a job that he went to college for and we were FINALLY financially comfortable and stable. A year later, Coronavirus.","We have been together for 11 years. He got his MBA in marketing and finance in 2009. He got his degrees right when companies started the hiring freeze.

So for the next several years he was job searching to no avail. So, he worked in a phone room for a few years, then at Costco giving out free samples, then working for a cell phone company kiosk at Costco. Once companies started hiring again, he was either overqualified, (he got his degree in political science around 1999, and worked in the whitehouse, Osha, and had a good job at the department of energy.) And/or not experienced enough being it was 5+ years since he got his finance and marketing degrees, and companies preferred people fresh out of college, or with work experience in that career. Which of course, he never got a chance to get.

I'm not college educated,  being that I was a single mother when we met. Together, we were often living paycheck to paycheck.

So, about a year and a half ago, he got the job he went to college for complete with amazing quarterly incentive bonuses! It felt like we won the lottery! We moved into a bigger and nicer place about 6 months ago. Everything was finally perfect.  

The benefit of his job during quarantine, is that he's able to work from home.  So, that's what his company has been doing the past two weeks.

But now,  I'm worried. Yesterday his boss called him and said that everyone is temporarily getting a 20% pay cut until further notice, and people are given an extra day off. 

I know it's temporary, but I'm scared that once we have settled into our new life, he's going to be let go because of the quarantine. And then he's going to have to start the job search all over again during another hiring freeze.",13,1585226489,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/fpatzo/after_10_years_of_job_searching_my_husband/,Wellthatsucks,1

foxwwr,furretguy,I feel like I might have lost my only friend?,"He went on this massive depressive ramble today. I am super worried about him. I emailed his support teacher asap and she has emailed his mum. Now to hope it isn't too late. Due to the quarantine I can't see him. 

I can't do much to help him other than comfort him. He refuses to get help and relies on me all the time. I suffer from real bad anxiety and depression and him complaining about life and how he is going to kill himself and wanting to give up gets me so so upset. I can't tell that to him and I've had many instances of me crying in bathrooms just so he doesnt see me upset. 

He doesn't do any work in school. He isn't doing any work at home and is telling me all the time how he's going to fail everything and why he should bother. I feel like he has gotten himself into this situation and he has to take responsibility to get himself out of it. I'll support him but I cant keep on emailing his support teacher whenever he goes on these rambles.

I've been in his place many times before, but I know not to like get too personal with him as I don't want him worrying. I don't think it is fair on me to be used as a support person and that's it. I've tried encouraging him to speak to outside sources but he keeps coming back to me. I'll always be there for him though. I just can't do anything to help him. 

I don't know what to do. I think he might get kicked out of school if he doesn't sort himself out. I would help him with his subjects but I don't do them nor have knowledge of them. And if he gets kicked out he might either get worse or better. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Anyone been through something like this? What am I meant to do?",1,1585169225,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/foxwwr/i_feel_like_i_might_have_lost_my_only_friend/,Wellthatsucks,1

fookx6,BatWolfie666,"Ordered a new bed, they never even rang my doorbell...","I'm sorry this is not a picture, I'm just so bummed right now.
So I've had my bed for ages and it had turned to absolute shit. Creaking, broken things, huge hole in the mattress, you get it.
Also I've been having some issues with my girlfriend and she is suffering from depression. We've been saving up together for a new bed because we thought that might give us a bit of a boost, since my room and my bed is where we spent a lot of our time together. During this quarantine, we planned to give the whole room a makeover. We ordered a bed and the delivery time was like a month and a half and we really couldn't wait for it to arrive.
So, the day before planned arrival, I put everything in my room aside, broke down my bed and I slept on just the mattress for a night. The bed would arrive between 7:30 and 10:30 in the morning. We would receive a call in advance.
I was still sleeping, knowing the call would wake me up. Never heard shit. The doorbell didn't ring, the dog did not bark, nothing. I call to check in, they say they were here. I heard NOTHING!
Now it will take WEEKS before they come again, I can't cancel the order, I have to sleep on this crappy mattress on the floor in a messy room AND they are charging me for not opening the door??
I'm not sure how to break the news to my girlfriend yet..

long story short: I ordered a new bed I really needed and wanted but I ""missed"" the delivery and now I have to pay extra and sleep on a crappy matress on the floor for weeks.",4,1585134946,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/fookx6/ordered_a_new_bed_they_never_even_rang_my_doorbell/,Wellthatsucks,1

fonokq,Ratstail91,My game was taken off the digital store due to COVID-19,"(It's only temporary until April 20th)

Backstory: I made a card game called Potion School, I spent 9 months on it - it's a physical card game that you can order from a print-on-demand store called DriveThruCards. I was hoping to sell a few copies to help get through pandemic-aggravated depression, but sadly the American card printers have been forcibly shutdown for a month, so everyone on DTC had their physical products removed from sale.

It's likely that an Australian printer that I was in talks with will also go into lockdown at some point - I was hoping to sell the game in an actual physical store for the first time too, but if they do, then I'm screwed for a month or so (they've already taken money for a printer proof, so hopefully that is done soon so I can at least show it to the store owner...). the game will likely also go into lockdown...

The only silver lining I can see is that there's supposed to be a stimulus package coming at the end of the month for disabled people, and that will hopefully help me to actually print the Australian batch of cards once this is all over.

It might just sound like whining, and it is to a degree, but this was a chance to get a bit of money for my gamedev studio. Now I need to be patient for a month or more. I know other people are suffering even worse and even dying, so I feel bad complaining about games, but games are my life, you know? They're all I have besides my family.",1,1585130094,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/fonokq/my_game_was_taken_off_the_digital_store_due_to/,Wellthatsucks,1

fodb7z,Alshad,N95 Masks are widely being reused... Think about that for a second.,"Doctors and nurses, the front line of this crisis, are fighting with limited resources.

One of my best friends is an ER doc for the military.  He informed me that the hospital has ordered the reuse of all n95 masks.  Logic being that the virus only can survive 4 days, so just ""quarantine""  your mask for 4 days, then reuse it.

Aside from the obvious unsanitary nature of this call, there is another issue.  Many (if not all) of the medical staff in this specific hospital have 1-2 masks left, being that they were originally informed to dispose of the masks after single use.  It's now common for them to wear the same mask, every (or every other) day.

PLEASE DONATE YOUR EXTRA MASKS TO YOUR LOCAL HOSPITAL... THEY NEED THEM.

If you're a shitty human being, and are selfish and self centered, then even go to the hospital and demand money for them.  I can assure you some decent human being would buy them and give them to the staff that needs them.  Just know there's a special place in hell for the price gougers.

&amp;#x200B;

fnus0d,lindie87,"Well, fuck. I got a new job. Supposed to start on April 1. But now, South Africa is on lockdown for 21 days because of covid-19. I was supposed to move to a new town on friday.","Lockdown begins Thursday night at midnight. I don‚Äôt mind staying quarantined where i‚Äôm currently at for 3 more weeks, but i just realized my problems are bigger than i first thought. 
I resigned my current job, so after month end, i‚Äôll be done. I‚Äôll have received my last salary from them. I cannot move before lockdown starts, the apartment that i‚Äôm supposed to move into, is still vacated. 
I‚Äôll contact the new company in the morning to find out when my new start date should be (it‚Äôs currently 01:50am). 
What i just now realized, is i‚Äôll be in between jobs after this lockdown, where will april‚Äôs pay check come from? I‚Äôve been living pay check to pay check, so i don‚Äôt exactly have a ‚Äúrainy day‚Äù fund, although i‚Äôve been able so save a little money here and there during the last year or so. 
I‚Äôll have to pay rent for this new apartment even if i can only move mid april, and that‚Äôs fine, but wtf am i going to do at the end of april? 
I don‚Äôt have savings that i can dip into, i‚Äôve had to use money when i travelled more than 800miles to go to the interview in the first place. 
My mind is racing at a million miles a minute. 
I thought this was going to be the start to a wonderful new life, new job, new town. I‚Äôll be 33 in June. I‚Äôm not married and i don‚Äôt have children.

I'm not trying to take away from the absolutely amazing work the NHS staff in sheffield, and the whole of the country for that matter, are doing right now, but, what about the rest of us who are really struggling to get the bare essentials in to survive.
Key workers was a term given to nhs staff, carers, delivery drivers and shop workers, so why arent all of them included in this early opening hours at supermarkets?

All I want is to not feel like I'm being treat like a 2nd class healthcare professional. I've been in my caring job for 8 years nearly, I love the work and helping people less fortunate than myself.

The symptoms are supposedly so mild that most people wouldn't even realize that they were sick if they experienced all of said symptoms. 

It's supposedly so contagious that everyone in close proximity of a carrier will be infected.

They claim that infected people sat for hours in emergency rooms with people that are supposedly at high risk of death if infected and failed to infect any patients, nurses or doctors.

They announced all of this using modern media that many at risk persons don't have access to.

If it spreads so quickly, we would have all gotten it when we freaked out and all went to the store at the same time to stock up on toilet paper.

I just bought animal crossing for her, so she can play it on my switch. She started yesterday and when the ""name your island"" window came she couldn't think of a name. So she put it aside to deal with it later. But later, she developed fever and nausea.

Now what does that mean. It means I can't play with the switch because her progress will be lost, but I can't wake her up to think of a name because my poor girl is sleeping in pain.

Due to circumstances (our living room needs to be dried out because of water damage) our only TV is currently in our bedroom and the sunlight is directly shining on the screen till afternoon. So I can't play on my Xbox or watch TV either.

fmr5ym,TotallyGotBanned,All I need is a painters mask.,"I went out couple months ago and got the paint to paint the inside of my trailer as well as the elasticmetic paint to redo my roof because I had a leak earlier in the winter but patched it.

The paint I bought is very very rough on the lungs so a mask is necessary. These masks are super cheap, come in a box of several and are really only good for paint, drywall dust and maybe some other uses but by no means medical grade.

Some hoarder came in and literally cleared the shelve before I could phone in to reserve a box of them. 

I phoned in at 8:45am, they opened at 8:30am...

They are only good for painting and barely barely filter out ultra fine particles...

fmmywb,Mars430,"Oh my God, I killed Kenny","Last night, just before midnight, I fell down a YouTube rabbit hole. I started out looking up Rodney Dangerfield videos thanks to a suggestion from Stuff You Should Know's podcast; next thing I know I'm watching a sketch clip (don't recall what it was now) that had an actor that resembled Kenny Rogers. ""Hmm,"" I thought to myself. ""That's a name I've not heard in a while; I wonder if he's still alive?"" A quick Google search revealed yes, he is. 

I wake up this morning and the first story on my reddit feed is Kenny Rogers died at 81.",6,1584825831,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/fmmywb/oh_my_god_i_killed_kenny/,Wellthatsucks,1

Then one week before premiere (which was today) I got call from the shop that they don't have enough copies of Deluxe Edition and all they can do is give me discount for regular copy of the game (which was 2.5$ so not much). And today I went to the shop with my friends who also pre-ordered Eternal to finally get it to our hands and everyone got their game EXPECT for me. Salesman told me that it did not arrive today and the shop is closed on weekends. In addition now my friends who haven't bought the game are telling me that they're already downloading cracked version for free (and as I checked there already is one).

flq3jn,hrhfernweh,"Bad news, after bad news, after bad news...","This is sort of long and there's a lot here, so welcome to storytime. Grab some popcorn, a warm drink, and maybe a blanket.

It all started at the beginning of this semester at school. This was supposed to be my last semester before I graduate with a Bachelor's. But the last thing I needed was an internship somewhere to qualify for graduation. After searching, applying, calling, emailing, being ignored by my school, and everything in between, I ran out of time and wasn't able to get anything set up.  After that, and a lot more back and forth, calls and emails being forwarded, I finally got an answer. I would be able to graduate in the spring, but I must complete the internship over the summer. I was relieved and grateful.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Enter stage right: COVID-19. Just last week, my school shut down on-campus classes. Okay, sure that's fine. No big deal. I've don't online classes before and it doesn't bother me. Except one of my professors, a very sweet old lady, doesn't even know how to use her emails. She found out about the shutdown from the news on TV, not even from the School itself. Not only that, but this class depends on participation and presentations for a grade. So, as you can imagine, it is already difficult enough to convert to online, let alone wondering whether or not my poor professor can figure it out and make it work. All this comes back to me wondering if this class will be canceled and not able to be completed. So again, I'm spiraling with thoughts and fears of not being able to graduate in the Spring. But maybe it doesn't matter because the graduation ceremony has been canceled anyway.

At this point, I don't care if I graduate or not, I just want an answer.

And the grand finale. I am currently in a long distance relationship with the most amazing guy. Even before all this craziness, I was planning to go visit him for 10 whole days!! With all these cancelations and more free time, I kept getting more and more excited! I was worried that flight's might get canceled, but I'd been keeping up with domestic flight news and everything was hopeful. Until a few hours ago. When my state of CA totally shutdown. Not complying may result in a misdemeanor. I wasn't supposed to leave for another 3 weeks. And we don't know how long the shutdown will be for, plus I haven't heard anything about my flight yet, so maybe there's hope? But I'm absolutely devastated.

Everyone I know keeps making goals for how they are going to use their new spare time at home, but I don't want to be at home. And I am far from extroverted.

It just seems like everything that could possibly go wrong in the last 4 months has done so, and I am heartbroken, worn out, and not far away from a meltdown. It feels good just to have it all out there.

TL;DR: life really sucks right now and I'm ready for a nuclear sized emotional meltdown.

I would love some positivity right now. Words of advice, Bible verses, quotes, anything really. Or just tell me how your life is going about now.",6,1584685176,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/flq3jn/bad_news_after_bad_news_after_bad_news/,Wellthatsucks,1

flaxta,Konvic21,Losing Job as Contractor for DoD in part by the recent Pandemic.,"So me along with several other contractors were just notified we are going to be jobless by the end of the month.

We work on a military base for a company that is contracted with the DoD.

We service military medical equipment (BMET) 

Now theres a few problems compounded here.

First, we were not notified that this was a contract position during interviews, I made sure I stated I did not do contracts. The first week in they handed everyone contracts to sign, we were already committed and had no choice then. 

We didn't start until around 7 months into the contract for whatever reason and some folks moved up here from out of state with leases on their apartments until the end of the year. 

Because of the pandemic, only essential personell are allowed on base, we are essential as we service medical equipment. But this seems to have affected the decision to cut/not renew contracts as well. So the folks that moved up here are now wayyy up shits creek since it's pretty much impossible to get a job right now with all that's going on. 

Also the contracted supervisor does not know a single thing about running biomed shops. They seemingly will hire anyone, I am one of only two people here with actual hospital experience, who have dealt with the full range of usual medical devices and trained/experienced on most.

A lot of folks here are not trained or certified and are working on high risk equipment they should not be touching. There's not even personal radiation dose meters for people working on xray devices. The military has its own standards I guess. 

The private sector is decades ahead in medical equipment, most equipment that we deal with are obsolete and were made by now defunct companies that are unreachable for service. 

""Military Grade"" will forever be a running joke to me from this point onwards. 

I'm glad I went to school and didn't join the military instead.",5,1584628255,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/flaxta/losing_job_as_contractor_for_dod_in_part_by_the/,Wellthatsucks,1

fkxr6b,New_Reddit_User1,My Friend's Car (My Future Project Car) caught on fire a day ago (Advice,"**(Advice is at the end of the long ass paragraph)** The Car Is A '91 Toyota Corolla Sr5 (Hard To Find), This was my friend's car, and i was hoping to have it and to restore it into a daily driver. as you can see that isn't going to happen, some hidden oil ignited while my friend was exiting off the freeway. There isn't anything we can do, me and my friend are broke and this car would be too much of a burden to work on. currently its going to to be towed away by the city into a salvage yard and out of our lives. **Advice: Have A Dedicated Fire Extinguisher For Car Fires Just In Case Of Any Car Fire To Save Lives And If Possible To Save The Vehicle. Also Clean Your Engine, This Could've Been Avoided If We Clean The Engine Good From Any Oil Build-Up.**

fjw12u,Yecal03,My husband may be locked (literally) into his workplace for Six weeks and I am suddenly homeschooling our Three kids.,"My husband works at a chemical plant. They are talking about lock in as the parish just got the first positive c19 test. The plant HAS to have a crew. It would be dangerous to leave it without one. So they would have a crew go in and lock them in for 6 weeks. No one allowed to leave. That would suck so so much but if locking in and shutdown helps to keep everyone safe I mean... They dont want to lock in and shutdown though. They want to lock in and keep the plant running. That means locking in at least double the amount of workers and this is the kicker keeping the shipping department open. How the hell will having them locked in help if you are going to have dozens of railcars and delivery guys in and out all day from New Orleans (the parish with the most cases in the fricken state) I mean .... the hell?

Also I absolutely adore my husband and the thought of spending one night away from him makes me want to cry let alone Six weeks. What if he gets sick and I cant be there? Who is going to feed them? It sounds like literal hell to be locked into where you work.

fjsp41,Cr8zyC8tL8dy,I scheduled my 30th birthday party during a pandemic.,"I have HORRIFIC luck when it comes to my birthday. Something usually happens.It all started when I turned 13 and my dad was scheduled in for a major operation on the same day. Since then whenever I try and plan anything it usually goes awry - on the day of my 18th birthday and party it snowed so bad only half the people invited could get there. The day of and after my 21st I had uni exams. There‚Äôs been sickness, accidents, family emergencies. My cat died 2 days before my 25th birthday. You get the drift.

The last three years have been no better. 2017 it snowed more heavily than it had in the last 30 years. 2018 it snowed MORE than that one! And 2019 I injured my neck and was high for two weeks on co-codamol, naproxen and diazepam (which was kind of great I guess. I think? I don‚Äôt really remember much). It‚Äôs been a slew of cancelled plans and lost excitement. But this year I planned ahead. I was going to outsmart my unlucky birthday plans. My 30th was going to be THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY WITH IT.

So I scheduled a huge 30th birthday party for a 3 weeks AFTER my actual birthday. I‚Äôd outsmart it. I‚Äôd avoid the inevitably terrible weather, the random bad luck that surrounded my birthdate. I invited over a hundred people, booked a hall, a bar, a DJ, spent over ¬£100 on decorations. The theme was fancy dress and movies - I spent so much time and money on my Mia Wallace costume, everyone was so excited and kept telling me their costume ideas and really getting into it. I ORDERED 100 BALLOONS. I threw party planning caution into the wind - for I had outsmarted my birthday bad luck.

And then this evening, 4 days before the party, the government announced a ban on social gatherings. To all intents and purposes, my party was now officially illegal. Because there is a literal worldwide pandemic occurring.

A literal worldwide pandemic has meant I have had to cancel my 30th birthday party. 

I thought I was so clever. But the universe had other plans.

I have since resigned myself to spend every future birthday plan free and see where the day takes me. I‚Äôm 99% certain that all future birthdays will involve myself, my cats, a bottle of wine, Netflix and any poor fools I have managed to lure in.

On an unrelated note if anyone knows of anyone who needs 100 Balloons for this coming weekend then tell them they‚Äôre in luck

fjphix,HomerHill,Left behind,"So I went to Costco, to get my food for the week, and there was a line of cars waiting to get into the parking lot. It took me 15 min to get a spot. I go get a shopping cart, luckily there were plenty. I get what I need for a couple of weeks, as it's my normal habit. The line was massive to check out, but since I was in no rush and figured it get worse as time goes on, I decided to stick it out. 
Having only 8 items in my cart, I get fast tracked to the optical center to check out. Not knowing the lady only rings 7 items, not 8. The worker that checks the receipt noticed and asked if I can go to the podium to ring up my last Item, delight coffee creamer. I do, it takes another 10 min for them to ring the item because the person who was supposed to be at the position left to take care 9f something else.
As I'm waiting I decide to box my items to fast track putting my groceries in the trunk. Once boxed, they ring my 8th item. I go back to the person who checks the receipt, and they have to fill out a little form for some reason. I patiently wait as she fills it out, anther 6 min. 
I take my cart to my car, just wanting to get out before it becomes real crazy at the parking lot. I lowas my 2 boxes in the car, 6 items that I've boxed and item number 7, a 24 pack of beer. I head home, and noticed that I left my item number 8 in the cart. Normally I'd go back for it, but just to go back into the parking lot will take more time than I'm comfortable with being around people with this amount of tension in the air.

fjjp38,Thatoneuser101,My Mum Came Home Crying Today (Coronavirus Panic Buying.),"My mum went out this morning to go to the bank and do some shopping in town. She was having a really good day despite me choosing to stay home from school, she left at 9 and came home at 11:30 visibly upset. I asked her what happened and she tells me that she saw an elderly woman shopping in Iceland (A UK store), she had no food in her trolley and looked worried. My mum asked her what was wrong and she told her that there was no more bread, milk, dog food etc. and she had no food at home for her or her dog. My mum asked some employees if there was anything for her and they said all their stock had already been used up. My mum then noticed two women with several trolleys worth of food (a lot of bread and milk cartons). My mum asked the women if they could give a loaf and milk carton to the elderly woman and explained her vulnerable situation. The women told my mum rather aggressively ""its everyone for themselves, what do you expect us to do? Give her our food and starve?"" the elderly woman heard them and told my mum its okay and that she'd find some other way to feed herself. 

I lost a little faith in humanity today and that kinda sucks.

fivwwv,PlEGUY,My aunt and uncle and their shopping adventure. aka: verify before you pass judgement,"As you all well know the corona virus is going around. Yea! As a result shopping has been getting a little hectic. Double yea! Honestly I feel like I could stop there for well that sucks. But the  pain train is still running with the boiler on high. 

So, my aunt and uncle decided today to go get groceries, because it‚Äôs Saturday and that‚Äôs what many normal people do on Saturdays. So they walk into the grocery store and behold! The line extends from the checkout to the back of the store... 3 times. So my aunt turns to my uncle and tells him to get in line. The line passes by the dairy section so he can grab all the stuff from there as he passes by. Meanwhile she will shop in the rest of the store. So they both grab a  shopping cart and begin their respective missions. Wait a minute... they both grab a shopping cart?

I suppose now is as good a time as any to mention that they are a family of 9. That‚Äôs right, my aunt and uncle have 7 kids. As you might imagine, they go through a fair amount of groceries in a weeks time. As it turns out, nearly two shopping carts worth. Anyone see where this is going?

So, my aunt gets back from getting the groceries from the rest of the store and joins my uncle in line. Yea, she had time to fill a shopping cart and he‚Äôs still in line. Fun times. Now they are both standing in line. They‚Äôve got two fully loaded shopping carts side by side. Normally, people wouldn‚Äôt think twice. Now however, they are starting to get looks from everyone around them. They can hear those around them whispering and grumbling about panic hoarders. Eventually people start speaking up to mock and ridicule them. They whine about how they are ‚Äúidiots for panic hoarding‚Äù. They moan about how ‚Äúyou know food can go bad, right?‚Äù They snarl that ‚Äúbuying groceries just to resell them is wrong‚Äù. Clearly no one ever needs buy a lot of groceries at once.

BUT our principal demands that teachers (more than 100) on monday leave their homes to fulfill their working hours at school and apply distance learning, with each teacher in a room. We will all have to share corridors, bar, canteens and bathrooms.

 The only plausible reason for this is arrogance and wanting to provide an environment to get more people infected and see us sick! Se can do Theo Dame work at√© home...

I have a family and have been home for two days, just go out to buy food ... I am very scared and not knowing what to do. For example, i don't know what to do with my daughter. Her school is closed and i cant leave her alone!

fi5441,fansopp,"My grandpa threw away a $50,000 watch","So my grandpa is a really cool dude who spent a lot of his youth at seas, especially when oil came to Norway. He was one of the first and longest sitting bosses at a Norwegian oil company and got to know a lot of powerful people. While he was a boss he was given a lot of stuff for being a good and profitable boss, one of which was a German watch that didn‚Äôt really fit his lifestyle and he wouldn‚Äôt really use it much, however he did use it when the occasion arose. So the batteries would work when he used it. 

Anyway many years later after the watch had been laying quiet in a closet for several years and collecting dust, my grandpa found it again. However he thought it was broken because it had stopped working and he couldn‚Äôt find a way to change the batteries and he didn‚Äôt think it was really special so he threw it in the trash not to be thought about for several years again. 

A few years ago however my gramps was at a clock shop to change the batteries in his current watch and while standing there he started talking to the watch person at the store. The conversation went to the old forgotten watch that was long discarded of. The watch man asked what brand it was and upon hearing the name of the watch he literally dropped what he had in his hands and told my grandpa that if he could bring the watch into the store he could get any and every clock of his choice in the shop. And the clock man was completely devastated when he found out what had happened to it, my gramps said it looked like the man wanted to cry and pass out at the same time because Turns out that faulty clock that ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt work‚Äô was actually an automatic watch that is powered by motion of the hand. So when my grandpa wore it he powered it and worse it was at the time worth more than FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS!!!!",5,1584127127,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/fi5441/my_grandpa_threw_away_a_50000_watch/,Wellthatsucks,1

The situation here is not that bad comparing with other countries, there are places where there's a lot of people infected and there are more and more cases everyday, but nothing like Italy. Well today the government decided to close all the schools/universities. I have to point that they started taking seriously the situation only after some people within the government were infected by the virus. Anyway, people reacted in a crazy way and rather than staying at home, inhabitants of the worst areas, who don't know if they are infected or not, went to other places of my country where the situation is controlled. They are really irresponsable for this, but it's not the worst: today I noticed that the supermarket was fucking empty. I was like wtf and asked the workers, and they said that people who come here think that we are going through the third world war or something and they are literally buying everything they can. There wasn't even toilet paper left, for God's sake. 
They didn't say anything about staying at our homes, but we are told not to travel (although people don't follow this) but the situation is a mess and people are being hypochondriac.

fh97ie,GarryD1995,Mom coughed on my food right after I pulled it out of the oven. When I called her out she said she coughed ‚Äúinward‚Äù so ‚Äúnothing went toward the food.‚Äù,"Just made a snack, and a minute after I set them aside to cool, my mother (who has been getting over a cold) coughed over my food as she was reaching over the counter to get something out of the cabinet. I‚Äôve already been making a stink of her coughing around the house and everyone without covering her mouth since she‚Äôs been sick. 

After I called her out on it, she proceeded to lie and make up an excuse that she didn‚Äôt cough on the food and that she coughed inward which doesn‚Äôt even make sense. She coughed right after saying that as to prove to me somehow that that is in fact what she was doing. She can never just admit she is wrong and say sorry about doing something wrong.

fgupkg,Skittyyyyy,Bought a limited edition vinyl. Received it damaged and the customer support of the shop (golfwang) won't answer me.,"Last year on the 5th of july 2019 I  ordered the limited edition igor vinyl even though with shipping it cost 50$, which was quite a lot of money for me but I wanted to have it. At the beginning of November it finally got shipped but golfwang didn't include my bill. That means if I wouldn't have sent it back to them I would have been forced to pay an additional 50$ in tax. So the post office sent it back and I got an email from golfwang asking me if they should reship it. So I said yes please reship it but please include all the necessary things for the border control which includes the bill, so I don't have to pay an additional 50$. Turns out they didn't include the bill this time as well because of that all of the following happend. The post office (DHL) again told me that I have to pay 50$. Now what I had to do was sending my bill to the post office (DHL) and then they sent it to the austrian border control. They then had to recalculate the cost which is 10‚Ç¨. All this stuff was such a pain in the ass but I thought okay, now  I'm done. Turns out DHL has to charge 18‚Ç¨ for processing fees because they had to send the forms to the border control. So overall I  had to pay almost 80‚Ç¨ for this vinyl. If I knew that it would have been like this I would never have ordered it. So now I at least was glad that I  finally had it. I opened the package only to find out that the cover is damaged really badly. I contacted the golfwang support on February 14th but they never answered me. I can't even enjoy the vinyl with everything that came with it. I at least would want a replacement or some sort of compensation but I feel like this is never going to happen because they are simply not answering.

Thanks for reading all of this.
