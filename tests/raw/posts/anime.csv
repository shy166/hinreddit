fso6dt,BroccoliSanchez,Gatekeeping in the community,"Now I want to preface that this is for genuine discussion and I would like to not see people being stupid in the thread. I've been in nerd culture for most of my life and I've seen things change a decent amount over the years. With the recent popularity of anime we've seen quite the influx of people into the community. With this influx it's brought in people that may not have the "" most honest"" intentions. As an adult I've met several people that have told me they enjoy anime or another ""nerdy"" thing (comics, games etc) and then proceed to lie or ""be found out"" that they aren't genuine fans. This is where I see positives of gatekeeping. People who only get into stuff for clout or to pretend to know anything should be kept out. I feel if you can't have a genuine conversation about something you aren't really part of the community. I don't play videogames outside of osu! so I don't really call myself a gamer because the title comes with a certain amount of baggage. Same thing with people that outright lie or have only seen one or two anime. You're not really an anime fan in that case. Now this is not to be confused with a newbie. If you're new to anime and have only seen two shows and seek to watch more than you should certainly not be kept out. That would be like calling a new skater a poser because they only know how to ollie or learned to push mongo instead of regular.",28,1585698199,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fso6dt/gatekeeping_in_the_community/,anime,1

I heard rem's speech (from re: zero) and it made feel she talked to me, like someone loves and believes in me and wants me to live and like I'm someone's hero.

It made me feel so happy and loved and I cried alot that night but not from being sad but from happiness.

And now I'm caring for cat I found at a park near my home (I feed her and give her water), I started doing sports and I get better grades it helped me alot and in general anime and manga helped me alot and made me feel like I have another friend who loves and cares about me.

fsn7xx,deadmouse9090,Why is Hyouka Good?,"When I watched it two years ago, I really wanted to like it because the animation is beautiful. But I really didn't like it. I remember there was this one episode where they spent like half of the show trying to solve a mystery on why a teacher messed up on which lesson he was supposed to teach. I was just sitting there thinking, ""who cares????"", I was pretty angry because I was just thinking why would they choose a mystery that's so boring. I mean, I could see that it shows how analytical Oreki is but I don't want to watch a long-winded explanation to a mystery that I don't even care about. 

Also about Oreki, I feel like his character is unrealistic? Hear me out, I know a lot of smart people(most of them are my friends) and even though they're not extroverted they all have a hobby that requires some brain (like D&amp;D). So for a character who's basically a genius that has no hobby is kind of unrealistic. With that much mental capacity doing nothing is just sooooooo boring, it would make life unbearable. I feel like he would have at least one hobby that challenges him, even if it doesn't include social interaction. Unless he's depressed, I can't imagine him doing nothing at all. 

I was also annoyed with Chitanda. I just remember thinking, ""If she's so curious why doesn't she try figuring it out herself?"". I was very annoyed that she just kept asking Oreki but barely bothered to try and figure it out. I guess that builds a relationship but I just didn't like it. Maybe it can be argued she just wanted to talk to him, but I would still find that annoying.

In summary, I found the mysteries mundane, and I thought the character interactions were boring and annoying . I really want to know why it's regarded as a masterpiece. Also, no doubt I forgot a few things about the show because I watched it two years ago, but that's what I remember.

fsmprk,ozgunozerk,FMA vs FMAB (my humble opinion for those the ones do not have time for both),"This is my first post about an anime, I don't know why, but I couldn't stop myself from writing this post. Hope you like it

Before my personal opinion, let me put this first, the story and the universe of FullMetal Alchemist is a great adventure.  I believe you can't make a mistake with either one if your aim is just to experience that universe.

As suggested in some other posts, I've started with FMA. After I finished it, I've jumped into FMAB, and after 3rd episode, I've looked into all the episodes and decided to move on from the 2nd Season instead. The reason for that will be very important for the rest of my critic. 

To my perception, FMA spared 50 episodes for the FMAB's first season only (plus a different ending). So with respect to 1st season, FMA is much longer than FMAB. And 2nd, 3rd, 4th seasons of the FMAB, I don't recall most of them in FMA (maybe even none except Ishbal/Ishval stuff). FMA consists of around 50 episodes, whilst FMAB contains around 60 episodes. Although FMAB is longer, because of the reason I've explained above, I believe FMA has better character developments and deeper details for the events. 

In other words, FMAB has much more content than FMA, but FMA dives deeper and allocates more resources to those less number of events. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** 

I want to sum this up with an analogy. I know the analogy itself will be an exaggeration, but I believe it will make my point clear.

**Watching FMAB is more like watching Pokemon, Galactic Football, or Shaman King (and way better than them in my taste). It's very fun, you get excited, animations are great and you feel like a child again, I DEFINETELY suggest FMAB for anime nostalgia :)** 

**Watching FMA on the other hand, is more depressive and adult. If you want an anime that has more psychological depth of characters and event, then I have to suggest you FMA**

&amp;#x200B;

Reasoning for the above statements:

Let me explain that with an event from the series itself, don't worry, no spoilers will be given.  
When I watched the Shao Tucker's experiment in FMA, I was shocked and profoundly disturbed. I couldn't continue the series right away, in fact, I couldn't do anything but to stare at the wall for 20 mins. You have to watch the series to understand why was I so disturbed, since I don't want to give any spoilers. But in FMAB, after watching the same scenario, I was like ""well, that's sad... Let's continue with the next episode!"". You might argue that, since I've already watched FMA, of course I was not affected the second time. You might be right, but the second time I've watched the same episode of FMA with my girlfriend, again, my mood became depressive immediately. Also, 2 of my friends that watched only FMAB, was not impressed by Shao Tucker's experiment as I was. They did not perceive why I was affected so much (and this difference did not occur with other anime's for us)

Another one: FMAB explains the relationship between the brothers and mom, and the death of their mom in a single episode. In FMA on the other hand, they have spared 2 episodes for this events, and during one of the scenes I had a lump in my throat, I was nearly going to cry: The moment when Edward started to run to his Mom after learning Winry's parents were dead. That scene was not present in FMAB, i felt nearly nothing in FMAB about the boys mom and their relationship with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other details:

*Animations* and *OST* is better by far in FMAB in my opinion.

I prefer the ending of FMA since it's more dramatic and not cliche, but I believe, the ending is not the emphasis on the series (unlike Code Geass). That's why, the criticism for the ending is in the ""other details"" section. Also I really liked the difference about **THE GATE**, and I would definitely prefer the FMA version of the gate. 

I can include more small details, but then my post will contain spoilers, and I decided to hold myself, not to spoil it for you.

Hope this post will be helpful for those who has to pick only one of them. If you have the time, I suggest watching them both!

*And lastly, I would really like to hear other thoughts on the differences between the two series, if possible, from someone watched both of them. I wonder what other opinions are there about these great series!*",5,1585693201,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fsmprk/fma_vs_fmab_my_humble_opinion_for_those_the_ones/,anime,4

However, a long, long time ago, I remember my mother and sister skimming through TV channels (because their channel wasn't working) and they came across this anime which they watched the episode for. 

I just remember a scene I watched as I went past playing toy cars:

*It was a blond, bespectacled man (wearing a beige raincoat?). It was raining. He was taking a little girl to the car. She saw her (father? Green shirt?) and ran towards him. Then she came back to the MC and hugged him as he knelt down to his knees in the rain. The girl then ran off and the man's vision blurred for a second as he watched the girl go. The only subtitle I remember clearly is the man saying to himself: ""If this is my fate, I will not run from it.""*

There was a monologue in the OVA which was not subs in the theatre, but now subs in BD/DVD (for obvious reasons). The post credit scene does not explicitly say who the VA is, so it is an unofficial confirmation.

[Memory Snow OVA](/s ""The monologue is a flashback to Puck's conversation with Echidna, a new character who has appeared in the season 2 trailer."")

The voice actor is Maaya Sakamoto, who has voiced Shinobu in Monogatari, Ruler in Fate/Apocrypha, Aerith in FF7 Remake, and Maki from Danganronpa V3, to name a few.",19,1585692686,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fsmjxu/unofficial_maaya_sakamoto_to_voice_echidna_in/,anime,8

I've basically looked up what happens afterwards, I've wondered what people actually thought about the final episodes at the time it was airing. 

Personally it seems that Zero Two's ark is essentially finished at this point hence the demeanor change in ep.16.


I know there's this giant and rushed finale ahead with just ridiculousness. So my question is would you finish it all the way through even after 16 ?

**REWATCH UPDATE**

Hey guys, host here. Sorry for the late post yesterday. I‚Äôve been told that because I linked a blacklisted site, the post had to be approved first. Mods sorted it out, so everything should be good now! I would also like to tell you guys that since reddit is being a buggy mess, I have to manually write out the entire thread now instead of just copying and pasting. Hopefully this can be resolved, but because of this, I‚Äôd have to spend a bit more time typing out each post when I could be putting more thought into the actual rewatch itself. The post time is still the same, and hopefully will remain the same. That‚Äôs all!

**CONTEST**

In my replies to everyone, I will have links that lead to different things. In one of those links will be a hidden Chika. First four people to reply to the post saying they‚Äôve found the Chika, I will randomly select one and give them **a gold award**. If one person manages to find it, but no one else has said anything for an hour, they will get the award. The hidden Chika link could be in any of my replies ranging from 1:00pm to 9:00pm tonight. Good luck!

fsitlm,EpicTroll27,Hoshiai no Sora: Finding Strength in the Face of Adversity (Writing Club Reviews),"# Background

While not a household name on /r/anime, *Kazuki Akane*, the director of *Hoshiai no Sora* is a renowned anime director. He‚Äôs well known for pushing the limits of what animation can do as well as for his unique charisma and work ethic. This outlook can be seen in works like *Escaflowne*, *Noein*, *Tetsuwan Birdy Decode* and even *Code Geass: Akito the Exiled*. However, many of his endeavours up until now have involved technical excellence as opposed to pushing the boundaries of anime storytelling. 

It's no secret that *Kazuki Akane* is dissatisfied with the current state of anime and feels that it could benefit from more meaningful stories being told. *Hoshiai no Sora* is born from a sentiment of wanting to portray a human drama about the troubled household lives of Japanese children and the many issues they face in their personal lives.

When we talk about influential socially progressive anime, there's a layer of obfuscation to them that rarely ever gets talked about. These arthouse pieces lack the straightforward and in-your-face approach taken by *Hoshiai no Sora* as it deals with its topics in a non-obfuscated manner easily discernible to the average viewer. That isn't to say that works like *Revolutionary Girl Utena*, *Princess Tutu* and *Paranoia Agent* aren't excellent at what they do. Rather, there's a distinct lack of influential anime that do it upfront like *Hoshiai no Sora*.

# Hoshiai no Sora as a sports anime

The show revolves around a group of boys playing soft tennis, a niche sport that has poor professional prospects. Soft tennis is used as a lens to explore the characters rather than as the focus itself. This results in a show that doesn't quite have the tense and hype matches you would expect from something like *Haikyu!!* but rather a more mundane Slice of Life where the boys play the sport primarily to have fun. This approach makes the characters more endearing without falling into traditional shounen archetypes. The sense of camaraderie that comes from sharing experiences is something Hoshiai tackles very well. Some of the best moments in the show come from the genuine interactions the cast has with each other. Soft tennis is played in pairs and these established pairs are used to build chemistry between individual characters. The individual personalities of many characters shine through in their playstyle while inter-communication is emphasized. [Light early spoilers](/s ""Early on in the show, Maki reorganizes the pairs into ones that would be better at communicating with each other while keeping playstyle in mind. As these pairs play together, their understanding of each other improves both on and off the court while the group's dynamic as a whole gradually changes altogether."")

After all is said and done, *Hoshiai no Sora* is about a group of troubled kids coming together to support each other and find solace in their daily lives. Despite the large cast, each character feels distinct without being defined by a traditional anime trope. Furthermore, the [excellent animation](https://sakugabooru.com/data/648f5b890121c1e6adc9f8962c25e212.mp4) and [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD8Ti0yKV18) do a fantastic job elevating the show. [Body language](https://sakugabooru.com/data/16e6bbc746947f850dd5c6b4697f69a3.mp4), [lighting](https://i.imgur.com/Hm6Eh4N.jpg) and [shot composition](https://i.imgur.com/GWUWjdN.jpg) all come together in a production that would be considered blessed if it weren't for the corporate betrayal it suffered. Sadly, *Hoshiai no Sora* is criminally unfinished and will forever be remembered as an example of what production committees can do to beloved IPs as opposed to what the show did right. And I think that's a damn shame really because *Hoshiai no Sora* has all the makings of a brilliant show that's approachable on a surface level without obfuscating its themes to appeal to an intellectual audience. This makes the moments where it gets down to its message all the more powerful.

# Hoshiai no Sora, queer rep, anxieties and child abuse

*Hoshiai no Sora* is inspired by an American film called ""Stand by Me"" which itself is based on a Stephen King work. *Kazuki Akane* intended *Hoshiai no Sora* to be ""essentially Stand by Me in modern Japan"" but dare I say it, his creation easily surpasses the work it's based on. The struggles in *Hoshiai no Sora* are meant to be viewed through a modern and progressive lens, something that a work like Stand by Me was incapable of replicating, being a product of its time.

What makes the abuse in *Hoshiai no Sora* so difficult to watch is how unabashed and blunt it really is. Rather than being romanticized, it happens when you least expect it, with no theatrics whatsoever, completely warping the atmosphere of the show. Akane really knows how to get under your skin and make you empathize with the anguish these children face. With the light-hearted tone most episodes take, the camaraderie between the boys and the genuine hope born out of it, the feeling that only despair awaits that hope is heart-wrenching. *Hoshiai no Sora* is one of the most respectful and serious depictions of abuse you can find in the medium and even if that's all the show was, it would be already something incredible.

But Hoshiai isn't just about the damage parents can do to their children. It's also a story of mutual support and the therapeutic effect that friends and a place to belong can have. By opening up to each other, the turmoil in their lives grows gradually easier to bear. The moments when these characters open up to one another are some of the most cathartic in the show‚Äîwith raw emotion on display, the sense of foreboding in the air and the eventual understanding that results from it. *Hoshiai* understands how difficult it can be to open up about feelings that you've been struggling with for a long time. It requires a lot of trust open up to someone like that and these confessions serve as a climax for the various character arcs throughout the show.

Furthermore, Hoshiai acknowledges the struggles children can face about their personal identity. It's also one of the most progressive shows to come out in recent memory in terms of queer representation. What makes it even more impressive is that Akane himself was unacquainted with this topic until he talked to a trans person and realized how sensitive of a topic this was. *Hoshiai no Sora*'s 8th episode is a masterclass in queer representation. It criticizes societal expectations associated with one's gender, highlights the confusion people can have about their sexuality and personal identity while perfectly encapsulating people's ignorance on the topic. Overall, it's a resounding message that it's alright to be who you want to be. All of this is conveyed in a single straightforward conversation between two people, a cis-gender male and a non-binary kid still struggling with their identity. Being told that you don't have to conform to labels or be burdened by the expectations other people have for you can be life-affirming, even in adulthood. It's a healthy depiction of queer people in a medium where that depiction is scarce. As someone who is constantly disappointed by the anime medium's tendency to create an air of plausible deniability around its more sensitive topics, *Hoshiai no Sora* is a breath of fresh air.

This queer rep ties into a larger message within the show. That sometimes, our anxieties are what hold us back in becoming who we want to be. The concept of broken homes exists beyond just parental abuse and even children with affectionate parents deal with self-esteem issues. Going against people's expectations and living in constant fear of rejection can be troubling when you have no one to understand you‚Äîno one you can open up to. But by finding just one person with whom you can, your world can grow much bigger.

Akane has created something wonderful that would undoubtedly strike a chord with many people going through the same emotions and struggles.

*Hoshiai no Sora* is messy and incomplete but it's a show that demands to be acknowledged, not for the story behind its production but for the heartfelt message it wants to convey.

**Watch Hoshiai no Sora if:**

- You liked Stand By Me.
- You liked Akane's previous work or anime in general that tackle difficult and sensitive topics.
- You want a show that isn't afraid to make you uncomfortable and is generally difficult to watch while also being a wholesome Slice of Life with authentic character interaction.
- You care about queer representation and LGBT topics in anime.
- You're fine with watching something unfinished.
- You can suspend your disbelief for all the characters in the show belonging to troubled households with abusive parents.

fsiejz,Vedgon,A little something about Rascal Does not Dream of Bunny-girl Senpai,"I just rewatched the show for the third time in 6 months, and there was a section which has hit home for me. I kinda felt like talking about it, so here goes. Minor spoilers ahead for those who haven't watched the show.

When Sakuta (the main character) was down in the dumps, Shouko (another central character) tells him about her philosophy of seeing life as a trial to become kinder with each passing day. She reassures Sakuta that by going through an unpreceedented pain, he has gained the ability to be empathic to others' pain, the way no one else can be.

I have felt the exact same way for the longest time, that one must remember their tough times to help others. It not only comes from learning from observing others, but also from personal experiences. This was also the reason I was surprisingly sympathetic towards the villain of [Split](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4972582/), even though what he was doing was fundamentally wrong. It's easy to succumb to your own pain and resent others who were unsympathetic towards you, and I really admire the way Sakuta went the other way and became someone who'd go out of his way to help others out.

I loved the way the character development was so well-thought out. His reasons for helping Mai was thoroughly rooted in his own trauma, and the way we, the audience, was lead up to it was very satisfying to watch.

Just wanted to blabber about this a bit *sweats nervously.*

Edit: Okay, I fucked up with the spoiler tag. Lovely.

Edit Edit: I can't figure out a way to use the spoiler tag, and the word spoiler itself is starting to look weird. Oh god WHY!?",5,1585679630,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fsiejz/a_little_something_about_rascal_does_not_dream_of/,anime,2

Everyone should watch Shirobako, it shows you the entire process of how an anime is made, all of struggles, everything. After I watched it, I really started to appreciate anime a lot more. When I saw mediocre animation before, I usually would just bitch and moan, but now that I understand what animators really go through, I‚Äôve become a little more understanding.

Some of the comparisons I've made:

1. Both appear with a somewhat relaxed nature, throwing the students off guard.
2. Both have seen the death of a close friend (while in trio). BTW this friend also died from falling rubble...Said friend then becomes evil.
3. Both train their students in a field of their expertise, but with the catch that whoever does the worst (or whoever doesn't get the bell in kakashi's case) is punished in some way.
4. Both are highly skilled and have that ninja aesthetic.
5. Both have ocular abilities that are very similar, but instead of copying abilities, Eraserhead nullifies abilities.
6. Both have high student failure rates and are shown off to be known for being hard on their students, SPECIFICALLY with a book showing records and such.",15,1585677168,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fshm18/mha_eraser_head_is_just_a_kakashi_clone/,anime,0

I thought it was cool but for some reason nothing was really grabbing me so I dropped it. I know the most recent batch of episodes was extremely popular and also well received so after about a year of putting it off, two days ago, I decided screw it, I'll go ahead and start it up again. I'm now almost finished with season 2 (I think) and I'm not really sure why younger me didn't keep watching this. So far I'm loving it. The action is great and the animation is excellent of course but I think it's the mystery of the world they live in that intrigues me the most.

fsgui4,Chariotwheel,Anime casts are not as young as many people think,"Many people make fun about anime, because the main cast seems to be usually pretty young. This is actually a misconception as the average age is in a number of popular anime series above the teenage age.

Anime | Average Age in Years
-- | --
Monogatari Series | 100
Sailor Moon | 161.7
Bleach | 82.5
Kanokon | 205
Hellsing | 169.25
Inuyasha | 62.25
Blood+ | 122.7
Dr. Stone | 3716.4
GATE | 239.8
No Game No Life | 1292

As you can see the average age of this very randomly and representative selection of anime clearly displays that the average age of the protagonists is beyond the school age. Now, mind you, that doesn't mean all anime have an older cast or that all characters are past their school age. After all, there are notable youngsters like [this green 14 year old](https://i.imgur.com/KPZAiyZ.jpg) or [this nerdy 17 year old](https://i.imgur.com/8qQlSen.jpg).

From a gaijin perspective it seems a bit odd, but Japan has the highest average living age in the world. The health care system is pretty well maintained, people take good care of themselves, eat healthy food and are also forged by birth from glorious nippon steel (note: please don't fold your babies). Japan isn't unique either. If you look at regions like the Middle East, people like Abraham and Noah lived to 175 and 950 respectively and in Middle Earth halflings are not even considered adults until 33.

Another example of this dissonance between the west and other countries is the start of work. In the anime series One Piece protagonist Monkey D. Luffy starts his pirating career at the age of 17 - in the west most people start pirating before they even start their teenage years. As people live longer in Japan they have more time to not watch their Plan-To-Watch-List.

Anime enthusiasts shouldn't feel bad about watching young protagonists since they're on average older than their parents or even grandparents. If it matters to you, avoid series such as Legend of the Galactic Heroes where the characters are on average in their twenties and watch a series about adults, like Sailor Moon with an average age of more than 161.

**In Conclusion**

Anime are stereotyped to be full of young people, when the average age of many series is pretty high, to the point of being out of the reach of regular school age. Many critics of anime are actually 100 years too early to call anime characters young.

fsg2to,Greed1505,I watched 'Your name' and 'A silent voice' in the last 2 days and here is my opinion,"I'll list what I appreciated and what I disliked in both movie and then tell you which I preferred.

(English isn't my native tongue so please pardon my mistakes)

FYI I watched the sub of both movies. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Your name**

* **The Good**

Stunning visuals: It's probably one of best animated movies I've seen period.

&gt;Rating: S

Great romance: I'm not a big fan of romance story but I kinda liked this one. It was executed and not over the top. Taki's and Mitsuho's behavior was natural and believable. Big plus that I didn't cringe.

&gt;Rating: A

Supporting cast: I think they did a really great job introducing them within this time frame. 

&gt;Rating: A

&amp;#x200B;

* **The less good**

Not enough character development: Although I recognized that the whole romance story was pretty good, I wasn't really emotionally invested in it because I didn't know the main characters. Sure, they give glimpse of their personalities but they lack in depth. I couldn't tell what made Taki different from any other guy in the film. They gave Mitsuha some backstory but it still wasn't enough imo.

&gt;Rating: C^(-)

&amp;#x200B;

**A silent voice**

* **The Good**

Solid cast: They gave depth to \*most\* characters. Ishida and his sister, Shouko, Yuzuru and their mother, Uono, Sahara, theses are main one that struck with me.

&gt;Rating: S

Great romance: It was just enough to made you interested and when it did happen it was very subtle. That's something I really appreciated that from this movie because romance done wrong can turn a movie into a cringe fest.

&gt;Rating: S

It wasn't just romance: Love story are kinda like polars. They all follow the same narrative scheme which make them quite redundant for people that are not really into it. I like that the course of events wasn't predictable.

&gt;Rating: A

Great character development: I'm just going to talk about Ishida because I don't want this to be too long.

I'd give a S Rating to him alone. This is all feeling and subjective but I had a real emotional connection with him. We were given the proper screen time to see him grow and change witch made it easier to empathize with him.

* **The less good**

Friendship cringe: Unless you give friendships enough time, they feel shallow and fake. I feel like \*some\* of Ishida's friends where just accessories for the story. The guy with green hair and Kawai's friend just felt off.

&gt;Rating: B

&amp;#x200B;

I think both where fantastic movies but  if I had to recommend one, it would A silent voice. It made me feel way more emotions than Your name (Bonus point for tear dropped). 

&amp;#x200B;

fse8ki,violetxvii,what anime should i watch next?,"i'm pretty new to the anime scene, but i've seen yuri on ice (which was pretty good! i used to be a figure skater so i was super excited to hear that there was an anime about it) and most recently, i watched attack on titan (which was ABSOLUTELY amazing. blew my mind. no words, but i loved it so much).

my favorite genre is usually action and i really like seeing platonic relationships/loyalty to friends or teammates. i like romance too, but mostly the cute, soft type of romance rather than sexual tension nonsense. i enjoy fantasy settings because of how cool worldbuilding is, but i like slice-of-life settings as well. my one pet peeve would be overly pathetic female characters that need to be saved all the time because i find it really frustrating/annoying. other than that, i'm pretty open-minded :)

also, it would be great if some of the suggestions could include animes that are suited for watching with family as well! i have a little brother who i watched attack on titan with and we're looking for something else to watch together. violence and all that isn't an issue (in fact, we both like action!), but he's only fourteen so please nothing too weird haha (like sexual comments, nude scenes, etc.) like, for example, i definitely wouldn't watch yuri on ice with him.

i looked up some animes and so far, i think sword art online and haikyu look pretty good (?). if anyone could tell me whether those two would be good based on what i've said so far (but no spoilers!), that would be great. please give me some other suggestions as well! thank you so much, everyone !!",6,1585666261,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fse8ki/what_anime_should_i_watch_next/,anime,0

fsdx9l,JapanDave,What are quiet scenes between action called?,"I am speaking of the quiet/peaceful/relaxing scenes that appear, often before or after an intense action scene, sometimes cut into action scenes. For example, action action action, then quiet, the protagonist sips some tea while watching sea-gulls fly over the ocean. No dialogue, no music, just the sound of the ocean and the birds. It's like a time-out, a chance to relax and catch our breath, or just to breathe. It's as if the temple priest has suddenly hit the singing bowl, putting a pause to all thought while we wait for it to ring out. 

Another example, in another medium, would be the level intro scenes before each fight in SNK's Last Blade 2, brief moments of zen before starting the action. 

I once read an essay about anime/manga that was pointing out some of the unique points when compared to non-Japanese animation/comics. The essay mentioned that these quiet scenes are common enough that there is a term for them. I no longer remember the term nor do I remember the essay so I can't look it up. 

Does anyone know what I'm talking about or am I rambling nonsense? If you do know, and if you know the term I'm looking for, can you please share?

fscmfj,GetFuckingDabbedOn,Let's discuss something about Shokugeki no Soma (S1-S3 spoilers),"So Shokugeki is actually one of those OP MC + Harem series that are super popular nowadays

**The OP MC**

Yukihira Soma spent his life in the kitchen training against his dad who's basically the Demon Lord of cooking. He's a bishounen food Luffy. 

So yeah he transferred into a super elite cooking school and immediately establishes his dominance as the new hot shit with skills worthy of the upper end of the top 20 students (including 2nd and 3rd years) in a ridiculously difficult school and he has the ability to win against almost anyone with enough time(kinda like OP Cautious Hero) Soma obviously gets stronger over time acquiring new skills that make him a terrifying opponent for everyone.


**The Harem**

Officially, Yukihira's harem is 4 members large, if I exclusively count members with romantic attraction to him and just like every harem MC out there the members were added over time and even contain classic archetypes like

The childhood friend: Mayu was introduced in episode 1 and she's known him since they were kids, all she does in look at him and do nothing tho ü§£

The female lead: A common character type, every Sakura of Naruto or Fairy Tail Lucy falls in here. Tadokoro Megumi is a moeblob country bumpkin, who Soma drags around everywhere, she even has her own ""help me"" moment like Nami and they have the classic ""oops I walked in on you naked"" scene. Before anyone questions her presence here in this list her feelings for Soma were heavily implied when both of them were at the place with those annoying kids(OVA if you don't remember) 

The gyaru(tsundere): Mito Ikumi was an ""enemy"" and she was Soma's first victory as he easily dispatched Mito and her top quality ingredients with mad knowledge and the cheapest ingredients possible(OP MC) Soma being the benevolent god he is treated her like a friend after beating her. 

The tsundere(ojou-sama + ice queen): Nakiri Erina, the last official member of the harem but the 2nd introduced, it took her quite a bit of development and foodgasms to wear away all that tsun, over 50 episodes in fact. She claimed her role as the real female lead after the shell cracked though

The oblivious MC: A fucking classic. Mr Bishounen Food Luffy here is pretty dense when it comes to the harem members, a ""Baka"" through and through and the perfect seasoning for this harem flavoured cocktail",3,1585660163,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fscmfj/lets_discuss_something_about_shokugeki_no_soma/,anime,1

fsarsl,silent_woo,The one advantage with the lockdown and working from home is the opportunity to watch anime you never got around to seeing.,"I've had mixed results so far. I started my lockdown a week ago and so far I've watched:

Starmyu - meh, not quite my cup of tea but watchable enough.

Time Travel Girl - really enjoyed this. I would love to watch more anime with a similar premise. Shame there's no season 2.

The Disappearance of Nagoto Yuki-Chan - Urgh! this is annoying me, 3 episodes in and I'm still waiting for her to disappear and get the ball rolling with the story.

Fruits Basket - Wonderful. Gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside when you watch it.

Charlotte - I liked this. The animation at times is very good. Liked the story if not somewhat weak in parts.

How about you. What new shows have you watched that was successful or unsuccessful so far?",31,1585651591,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fsarsl/the_one_advantage_with_the_lockdown_and_working/,anime,1

fsaj82,keyppa,Just finished Shinsekai Yori. Wow.,"**This is gonna be long but I need to share my thoughts so I'm pouring my heart out here!!**
I have finished the show entirely, so major  [**SPOILERS**] will be discussed. 

So.... I knew nothing about this show going in, only read the basic synopsis online. I googled NOTHING during watching, the only thing I did for my sanity cause I **needed** to share my feelings/thoughts with others lol, was go on reddit and read people's thoughts on the spoiler - free rewatch threads.

Shinsekai Yori reminds me of JRPG video games that take you through this incredible world building, attachment to characters their motives and feelings, shows you gorgeous scenery and then when you come to finish the game this weird sad feeling hits you in the gut. I don't want it to all be over, I wanna go back. That's what this show did to me and that doesn't happen often. 
What a show. Obviously, it's been years, so many people probably say the same thing about the meaning and message. Who is right or wrong, morality, individual vs doing things for greater good... so many things this show touches on. And of course, it leaves you wondering about many things in our world and brings you to question things. That stuff likely gets discussed a LOT and I love it, but instead, I think I wanna talk about how this show touched me in other ways, too.

I'm a very sentimental/nostalgic person who values relationship building in shows, characters/memories, art style, and silly things like cinematic shots of sunrises/views lol so of course I wanna talk about some of those things. 

The characters. The relationships between them. The world building. The different genres this show went through. 
I cried after the screen went black and I felt so many emotions. I cried in the last ep when the people in the trial room laughed at Squealer when he said he's a human too. It broke my heart...who is the true evil here? I got scared watching this show (like legit terrified heart racing), extremely relieved, happy to the point of tears, nervous for the characters and the world, confused at the info dumps, super doubtful of characters, angry at the rats early on but them doing a 180 towards the end and feeling bad for them. I felt nostalgic and in love with the art especially during the winter/snowy section, it reminded me of video games when I was a kid. I loved the outfits, every single one of them were gorgeous! So many twists and turns and genres in this show resulted in so many emotions and bear in mind I started watching this yesterday so I binged it in 2 days haha. 

But character wise man.... guys. I wrote down my thoughts starting from ep 11, and I mentioned that from the start I LOVED Mamoru cause he was so sweet and precious and shy. I really hoped he wasn't gonna turn out to be the all evil one, or that he'd die. He seemed the most real out of all of them but also just really sweet, and I felt bad for him always being a little left out. 
After him, I probably liked Satoru next, and from about ep 9? onwards, I liked him the most. He had SUCH a character arc man, going from being the cheeky/annoying kid to being courageous and smart, and really sweet. So of course I was praying each episode towards the end that he would survive and NOT be evil and end up with Saki lol so I was soooo relieved at the end. I wish they had more moments together... I know Saki liked Shun, but there's no way she didn't have *zero* feelings towards Satoru... they flirted in a cute kiddy way and he actually went through the most with Saki. They had so many moments of the story together, so I always looked forward to their time together as adults too but it wasn't as frequent.
  As much as I liked Maria, I was always under the impression she was better with Mamoru (she was always first to hug him and look after him even as kids and he was always clingy with her) so I was also thankful when she said she'd stay behind with him in the snow. WHICH BRINGS ME TO oh my god when it was revealed they actually were dead...with the bones... and dna.... my heart crumbled when I realised what actually happened. So dark this show got man... they really had us fooled. Well, squealer did. Maria was a great friend to Saki but I always saw them better as best friends rather than lovers, cause it seemed Saki always had her heart saved for Shun. Who, by the way, is such a pure, sweet, clever bean who was too precious for this world. I feel like we didn't get to know enough about him though, so I didn't build as much of an attachment to him as I'd have liked. 
And obviously Saki, she was great, but because the story is from her POV and her narration, I kept seeing her as more of a projection of the viewer rather than a character. I know, weird, and probs makes no sense lol. But I knew she wasn't going to die so I had no worries for her, we saw everything from her POV so it was different for me. (which reminds me-is the novel the same? from Saki POV only? does it go into detail on what the other 3 did when they got split up during summer camp?? like when satoru/Saki have the whole queer rat War thing, what on earth did the other 3 do?? I still wonder this lol. Also, was it ever confirmed how Mamoru got rid of that copycat in the hallway?? It seemed like he was becoming a Karma demon.. or did he just suddenly channel his inner powers when he was scared?) 

I wish they dove into more about Reiko and her disappearance, she was originally in their group too. Sakis sister too.. but I guess with the memory wipe thing they had nothing to look back on. Yet Saki remembers Shun right at the end! My question, did Satoru and Shun really love eachother as lovers? I read on reddit that the reason they all were encouraged to get into gay relationships was to prevent stress/babies etc, but it seemed satoru was also needing to remember Shun as his lover/friend in order to begin healing too. Either way, the love/friendship/bond that was created between these characters is what actually kept me sticking aroud. They did an AMAZING job at it, and the way they all grew up together, changed together, but still remained tight.. it warmed my heart like no other. Also tore it out by the end, remembering that it's only the two of them left.
That flashback montage at the end of them all telling Saki things was instant sob material. Oh my god. Nooooo.

Anyway, I loved this story so much. It touched my heartstrings in all ways, I was initially in love with the story when it started, then really bored of the forest/queerat episodes back during summer camp, then back into the story after they returned, then super invested as the winter arc rolled around then just couldn't stop watching. It takes you through all the feels and its insane to me that everything that happens in the show, like literally everything, can be traced back to the first few eps. It makes it all the more rewarding and encourages rewatches for foreshadowing, but also makes you appreciate flashbacks/sentimental moments, like Shun talking to the minoshiro way back during summer camp. When Saki recalled that moment in the last ep i almost cried, simply cause it happened SO LONG AGO in the story (years for her) but also felt so long ago for us as viewers too, cause of this insane journey we've gone through with the characters. It made me remember that whole summer camp arc, that scene, their reactions finding out about it all, Shun's curiosity and intelligence, how young and innocent they all were then, and then remembering now they're all gone. Those times are gone. This show keeps hitting me haha. 

I recommended it to my mum, and I'll recommend it to others. Banana Fish is my favourite anime but this one is definitely up there with it. Solid 10/10, I'm glad I watched it. I am gonna read the novel now to get all the left out info and what not and relive this incredible story again!

I‚Äôm one who personally loves buying the Blu Ray and DVD combo packs. I use the DVDs pretty frequently, as much of the Blu Rays. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of newer releases and titles, some older re-releases, even pre order series are Blu Ray Digital. The digital does nothing for me really/ and this really bums me out. It‚Äôs honestly a huge turnoff to me to not have the option available. I will always buy the DVDs combo over Blu Ray and digital, It‚Äôs worth it to me even to spend another $10 to get that. It honestly just makes me want to wait and buy secondhand because it‚Äôs not worth it to me to get them new anymore, there‚Äôs not much of a point to me. 

For some series I can understand, especially releases that have been out a while. For series that had a part 1, and 2 release that was out for a while, sure, but some brand new releases it seems there isn‚Äôt an option anymore!!!! I want there to continue to be an option. For bigger titles at least would be great. To me the digital release is kinda dumb, I‚Äôd rather have a dvd set too 1000% more.

fs84s4,Glermpf,"Welcome to the NHK and Quarantine, a Review","*\*Reader be warned, this review contains mild to major spoilers.\**

A week into quarantine and I found myself browsing through my to watch list, passing series after series, each one seeming as unappealing as the last. We‚Äôve all been there before. I made it to the bottom of my list and I saw it, *Welcome to the NHK*. With my knowledge on the story being limited to the 15 second description I read, I figured now was as good of a time as any to finally delve into this series that's been trailing the back end of my need to see‚Äôs for so long.

Two episodes. That all it took. Two episodes and I was hooked. Yamamoto‚Äôs *NHK* brings us the story of Tatsuhiro Sat≈ç, a 22 year old paranoid and anxiety filled hikikomori, or NEET, who spends his days and nights locked away in his landfill of an apartment. Between his  delusions, isolation, and that pesky song his neighbor keeps playing, Sat≈ç can‚Äôt find the ability to do much besides watch TV, smoke, drink, and masturbate. This pattern continues for years until us, the viewer, is introduced to his life.

Over the course of 24 episodes we watch Sat≈ç‚Äôs meek existence transform as the small, yet densely packed cast start to be slowly introduced. Hitomi Kashiwa, Kaoru Yamazaki, Megumi Kobayashi, and most importantly, Misaki Nakahara. A mishmash of misfits and outcasts with their own cluster of problems find themselves tangled up in the life of this lousy hikikomori. During these interactions we see Sat≈ç and crew weave between progress, euphoric highs, relapse, and devastating lows. What *NHK* lacks in visuals and plot, is completely made up in the emotions and character development presented along the way. They‚Äôre the ones that made me stay. They‚Äôre the ones I wanted to cheer for, the ones I became repulsed with, and most often, an unsettling mixture of both. These characters soon meant so much to me because I quickly realized that they were me.

With a virus making the world grind to a halt, life quickly grinded to a halt as well. Anxiety coupled with a lifelong case of asthma, I soon found myself in an isolation of my own to prevent the spread and acquisition of COVID-19. With my sense of time and normalcy slipping through my fingers, I soon found fewer and fewer things to ground myself. I felt myself stuck in a limbo between reality and something that's not quite that. Soon after, I started *NHK*. I found something to ground myself in. *NHK* introduced me to Sat≈ç, a character who months ago I had no resemblances to besides age, suddenly resonate with a major part of my current life. While the circumstances leading to our isolation were different, I related to him heavily, I soon related to all of them heavily. Sat≈ç‚Äôs grandiose fears of people and the world, Yamazaki‚Äôs issues of trust, Misaki‚Äôs desperate attempts at being wanted and desired, Kobayashi‚Äôs need to support her family and self, Hitomi‚Äôs even more grandiose and extreme views of the world. I saw myself in all of these. *NHK* turns your focus from the literal virus rampaging around the world to the figurative virus that resides in ourselves. Sat≈ç constantly being forced to go head to head with his demons forced me to contemplate my own. A combination of isolation and social unease can lead us to our more sullen thoughts. *NHK* guaranteed this for me. I found myself at high‚Äôs when Megumi‚Äôs brother finally broke free from hikikomori, Sat≈ç and Misaki went on dates, and when Sat≈ç and Yamazaki finally finished their game. But the low‚Äôs of relapse, despair, and suicide hit just as hard. At 2:00 am I found myself soaked in a deep melancholy watching the ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù arc unfold in front of me. Maybe because of the circumstances, but *NHK* made me feel emotions that a show, or even life in general, haven‚Äôt made me feel in a long time.

*NHK* may have left me feeling uneasy but that‚Äôs okay. It also left me knowing that life moves on. It‚Äôs never too late to get back up and try again. And if you fall back down again that's okay too, just get back up and try again. *NHK* shows us the power of human perseverance. We see that even when life gets to its absolute worst, you can still try again and succeed. We learn that countless amounts of people will be beyond happy that we did decide to try again and keep trying even if we don‚Äôt know it or them yet. *Welcome to the NHK* shows us that people are flawed and far from perfect, but that's perfectly okay.

""I think I finally understand. As long as there's someone who'll grieve, it's wrong to want to die.""

Who knows though, this could all just be one giant conspiracy.

Now given how long the series is, it's going to need a lot of time from me. So as someone who is new to the series, which should I start with? Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z KAI? I'm going to choose KAI because I hear it gets to the point and cuts out filler episodes, and is also an HD remaster. Dragon Ball is a prequel which stars Goku as a little boy, which sounds really cute! So which should I watch first and why?

fs6o02,twista_tazz,‚ÄúWhy Do I Hate But Love Attack On Titan? (SPOILERS)‚Äù (repost),"

I started attack on titan in 6th grade (about 3 years ago) and finished the only 2 seasons that were on there (i think) and continued just last month to watch the new stuff, but stopped. I don‚Äôt know why, but the show‚Äôs always seemed a bit boring and depressing to me. Probably because i‚Äôm more of a ‚Äòhappy ending‚Äô type of guy, and i wouldn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs because of my age either.
 

I‚Äôm 15, and not to be arrogant, but I‚Äôve always noticed the difference in maturity between my peers and I. But anyways, I think that‚Äôs just the type of person I am and has nothing to do with my age. But what made me stop watching recently, was a manga SPOILER that I came across in a Youtube comment section. 


The SPOILER was about how Eren had told Mikasa that he‚Äôs always hated her and called her a slave, and proceeded to beat the living dogshit out of Armin. I saw that and immediately stopped watching. Yes, I know anime adaptions aren‚Äôt identical to the manga, but how could they possibly leave that big of a part out? 


So basically all in all, I stopped watching because I don‚Äôt like the shift Eren has and the whole story just seems pointless. For ONE, some people love that type of stuff (intense character development/shift), and don‚Äôt get me wrong, so do I but IMO they‚Äôre turning Eren into a dickwad. 


Yes I know he watched his mother get devoured by that god-awful smiling titan that killed Hannes as well, and he also carries a heavy burden as the savior of his hometown, so I get why he‚Äôs not a ‚Äújump for joy‚Äù type of person, but there‚Äôs no reason for him to turn into a complete asshole, and betray the only people he‚Äôs cared about in the last 4 years of his life. 


now for NUMBER TWO, regarding the storyline, it‚Äôs kinda pointless to me, it‚Äôs an isolated society who have little to no hope against the titans who are slowly conquering the world, and they all pretty much know they‚Äôre gonna fall to them. And on top of that, the one who holds that beam hope is turning into an ass. And like i said, I know some people thrive for that type of development whether it‚Äôs for better or worse, but me, again..I‚Äôm more of a happy ending/story type of guy. 


I have a feeling a lot of you are gonna call me an anime noob, being that i‚Äôve only watched a little over 15 anime, but that‚Äôs just my take on the show. I think It‚Äôs a very well put together show, but I still have all of these feelings about it...Who knows, maybe the more anime I watch, the more I like dark character shifts like this one, but for now, It‚Äôs not looking too good for AOT from me. (Let me know if any of you guys feel the same or if you think you can convince me to continue!!)Thanks!

She even once made my head bleed, locked me up, beat me, gave me scars on my hands and legs. But I am interested to know how and why I like Incest story. So if you have any guess. About this matter then please give me a comment or message about this.
My favorite anime OPs and EDs.
All Monogatari OPs and EDs. Hears a true Song Masterpiece only Carole &amp; Tuesday
Can be better than this one In terms of song's Not OPs and EDs if what I heard about the anime is correct,
Yosuga no Sora you can say that Incest is gross but the OP and ED of this anime is something else.
These are not just song's but also are Expressing the emotion of the characters. The OP and ED both are worth watching and hearing. What I love most about Yosuga no Sora is not just the Incest but also the drama. And it's one of the first romance anime that I have watched also it's short. I am not a fan of short anime but if done right I love them. I am tired of watching 3 seasons of an anime and waiting 6-12 years for it and that's why I also sometimes want to watch a short anime  . Like Koi no Katachi and Maquia also Angle Beats! And Kuzu No Honkai all five of these including Yosuga No Sora are masterpiece to me and my favourite is Koi No Katachi. This is one of the main reasons I started reading Visual Novel Manga and Light Novels, 
Kuzu No Honkai OP I love this one the singer sings so fast but also beautifully also it's one of my most favorite Romance Anime plan to rewatch it,
Angle Beats! OP and ED 2. This is a masterpiece and I highly recommend that you watch this one,
Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood OP 2 there are some more Full Metal OP and ED but I don't remember them I only watched them once and that was 2018 and I am waiting for a 24 inch 1080p monitor before rewatching them ( I have 200+ GB off unwatched anime ),
One Piece OP 14 there are some good ED but I don't remember them I stop watching One Piece plan to start watching them in the future,
Goblin Slayer OP and ED. These are emotional. If you translate the songs then you will see that it is expressing the feelings of the characters just like Yosuga no Sora.
Oreimo sorry this is the last time that I will include OPs and EDs from a Incest series. The OPs were sung by two of my favorite singers.
Steins Gate OPs. I only watched 3 episode and didn't watch any more this is why I didn't hear the ED of the anime. Also the OP was performed by my favorite singer Ito Kanako. Sorry it's just the songs upper on the list had emotion I am not saying that your song's don't have emotion. Your song Sign was incredible and also had emotion but I didn't read or watched or completely watch the anime and Visual Novels that you performed in. I do know you ED song on Saya No Uta and it was a masterpiece but this is a Anime OP and ED list so I am very sorry that your name was so down the list but I will make you number one one the VN OPs and EDs,
( Still Waiting for my 24 inch 1080p ips monitor ).
I would have included many more but this is already very long and also getting personal so I will stop at this far.
So what are your favorite ANIME OPs and EDs.",3,1585625476,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fs5kpj/my_favorite_anime_ops_and_eds/,anime,1

I‚Äôm French, living in France, but i‚Äôm fluent in English and always prefer to watch English dubs when it comes to anime (same for video games... and pretty much everything to be honest, English is much more expressive language than French in my opinion).

Anyway, there are many places online where i can watch anime in Japanese with subs (French or English subs) or French dubs. I can also find English dubs... but usually without subtitles.

I used to have a suscribtion to Funimation but i had to use a VPN to access it because, as you know, Funimation is only available in the US...

The combination of the art style, world building, and themes really clicked with me for some reason and now I want more, but I don't really know where to start looking to find similar stuff. Other anime I have tried to watch in the past has been entertaining but full of one note characters, annoying filler,  and has led to me rolling my eyes more than being invested.

I multitask when watching anime but I can just sit and watch them full heartily, but there are exceptions of some that I got really into. So please only recommend dubs, it's really all I have time for atm. I know that limits the recommendations sadly but it is what it is... ))

Let me get this out of the way to not waste anyone's time or thought*:*

!!!!!**DO NOT** Recommend me Hentai, Ecchi, Harems, Constant sexualization of females/males, or incest related themes that go beyond a small scene or slight hinting!!!!!!!!! ^(Do not point out scenes of my anime list that have these sorts of themes because trust me I already know it happened I watched the damn thing lol, I didn't care for it when it happened.)  
^((One scene of a boob grab or a blush up the skirt shot is fine, only if it happens EXTREMELY rarely. I do not enjoy anime of that sort in the slightest and hate it. DO NOT fight me on this, this is an opinion and I'm not looking for a fight. You can do whatever you want watch whatever you want, I am just strongly saying to not waste recommendations on things like this.))

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is a list of Anime I've loved when I watched them!**

\- Deadman Wonderland

\-Psycho-Pass 

\-Wolf and Spice

\-Claymore

\-Soul Eater

\-SAO ^((1-2))

\-Attack on Titan

\-No Game No Life

\-Full Metal Alchemist ^((ALL, but especially Brotherhood!))

\-Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic

\-Death Note

\-Danganronpa

\-Tokyo Ghoul

There are others I can't think of at the moment since they were a long time ago and or had names that weren't fully English or made much sense so can't remember cause I'm noob at anime lol.. I'll add if I can think of them.

**^(There are also many more mainstreamed popular anime that I know could be good but haven't dived into the rabbit hole yet, those being like Dragonball(s), Bleach, Jojo(???), One Piece, Inuyasha. Never said I won't watch those nor are they uninteresting, just seem like too big of a bite for me atm is all.)**

**I don't mind watching animes that are incomplete!** Although some I've watched never had a conclusion, I'd rather watch a bit of a good story than have it go unwatched.

BUT LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT I LIKE or what I am interested in.

With the themes of the anime in mind above, here is some vaguer things to consider: I love adventure, I love crazy stories that make you think and love interesting plot twists. Gore does not bother me so keep those gory animes in mind! I love mythical beasts, beings that are new and unique, colossal even. I love a story with a character that develops. I love epic action. I am not necessarily space/mech fan, but if you can persuade me then maybe I can give it a try. I ***LOVE*** game themed or medieval things.

fs2h49,harriskeith29,[DISCUSSION] What If Scott Pilgrim Were Adapted Again As A Western Anime Series?,"&amp;#x200B;

[ Promotional poster idea ](https://preview.redd.it/hxptiawugwp41.png?width=445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8eff0bcb259dbccbd74260f6ec8e1fe855175cd)

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, let me clarify that I LOVE 2010's *Scott Pilgrim* film adaptation. I own both the movie &amp; six volume comic series (or graphic novel, if you prefer), and I thoroughly enjoy both for different reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw the movie before learning of the books, had a blast with it in theaters, and quickly sought the source material despite going in with other fans having told me the film made some major changes.

&amp;#x200B;

As an adaptation, I stand by my opinion that the movie did about the best we could've hoped for with what it was given. After all, it not only faced the challenge of adapting a six-part story into 112 min.

&amp;#x200B;

It was also tasked with marketing an at the time relatively obscure property created by an author only a small minority in the U.S. alone had heard of. It had less brand recognition in America back then.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember reading somewhere (Of course, my dang memory forgot the source) that the movie was initially conceived as a trilogy to make more room for the source material and flesh out the cast.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering the odds of prolonging franchise longevity, however, it's understandable why Universal wouldn't risk leaving the film on a cliffhanger when they were already unsure how it would perform.

&amp;#x200B;

After watching the *Scott Pilgrim vs. the Animation* prequel, I saw such potential and wondered, *""What if Netflix or some other service adapted the books into a series with the same art style, but more budget?""*

&amp;#x200B;

As deeply as I commend how much the film managed to cram into what ended up a coherent, well written, funny, visually awesome and surprisingly compelling narrative, it still had to cut out a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of what made *Scott Pilgrim* successful was that it was in some ways a *""slice of life""* story. The characters felt so grounded &amp; relatable, even in this epic universe of super-powered meta-mayhem.

&amp;#x200B;

[ One of my favorite images from the final book, such a powerful moment ](https://preview.redd.it/7e50c5nygwp41.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d2ff37c6d32b6c3ec9383e6c4d25499c08f4111)

&amp;#x200B;

It was a coming-of-age drama, romantic comedy and a commentary on toxic relationships while at the same time learning to take personal responsibility for your actions (both Scott &amp; Ramona) all at once.

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many character-driven moments (big &amp; small) the film didn't have time to explore, which takes something away from how we connected to different members of the group over time.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Well, maybe we connected to every character except Julie? Just... F\*ck Julie. ](https://preview.redd.it/u0cx53l1hwp41.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d340350d67acde08a5a3502000da2039aeb33f62)

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, I wouldn't adapt everything beat-for-beat. Some of the film's changes, I actually found for the better. Ex- Leaving Lynette Guycott a background character and having Todd hit Knives instead.

&amp;#x200B;

It still made sense to me. While Lynette's bionic arm was a cool surprise, no more over-the-top than this world's other craziness and a nice reference along with her name, it felt too random in context.

&amp;#x200B;

She had no personality and never contributes anything to the story again. I'd also trim the fat on other unnecessary elements while perhaps combining the best aspects from what worked in the movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Ex- Outside the advantages of film to convey the fights, the movie improved some dialogue imo, timed jokes better, paced certain sequences better (Ex- Matthew Patel), Gideon was more *""love to hate""*, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Three gags that had the audience dying, myself included, in my theater: 1) Julie's swearing censor. 2) Scott's perfect timing of *""Sh\*t!""* upon seeing Envy. 3) Scott jumping out the window to avoid Knives.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm unsure how much I'd want to use from the film vs. letting this adaptation be its own thing, though I'd ideally love if the cast returned to voice and the opening theme could use ""*We Are Sex Bob-Omb""*.

&amp;#x200B;

One aspect I found 100% better in the book was the ending. Setting aside the film's alternate ending, which struck me as fundamentally missing the point of the whole story, the book felt better executed.

&amp;#x200B;

[ As satisfied as I was at Gideon's death in the film, I disliked Scott &amp; Knives defeating him with Scott dealing the final blow instead of him &amp; Ramona killing Gideon together. ](https://preview.redd.it/aag9wmr4hwp41.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ca00c952b68e622df67756b1e4c779b09cb7a90)

&amp;#x200B;

Whereas the movie carried the exact same spirit, but came off to me as rushed, duller and more generic, like *""Okay, it's over now, bye""*, the writing &amp; art in the comic's finale left me far more satisfied.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything the books had built up complemented the emotional payoff, making it more impacting. It was like, *""This is a major turning point. Scott &amp; Ramona have both matured and earned a second chance.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Now, they take a leap of faith together into an uncertain, yet hopeful future, starting over but with stronger love &amp; mutual respect than ever. They saved each other, and this is the beginning of the rest of their lives.""*

&amp;#x200B;

[ The dawn in the film was a nice touch, but still nowhere near the beauty and emotional catharsis of the comic in my opinion, though that's not entirely the film's fault. Again, it was adapting a six-part story. ](https://preview.redd.it/ude1xsj7hwp41.png?width=929&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8390550de155faceac7856fb6e47a9c2ee85fd2a)

&amp;#x200B;

I can't tell you how much it would warm my heart (and possibly cut a couple-few onions) to see this sequence animated in a finale to the full story retold onscreen, re-introducing it to a new generation.

fs1fwe,Nickster914,All the evidence you need that Naofumi KISSED Raphtalia in the finale of Shield Hero!,"Here we go again. *sigh* Let's do this. To all the dumbasses who think Naofumi and Raphtalia hugged at the end of Shield Hero, here's all the evidence you need to be proved wrong. BTW, I am posting this from an Oculus Go, so you'll have to go look up the picture yourself.

1. Your head doesn't tilt sideways during a hug. Naofumi's was.

2. You don't usually close your eyes during a hug. Naofumi's were.

3. Maybe you're claiming ""But it was a hug in the manga!"" That might be true (If it is or not, I don't know), but the anime went off of the original source material; the light novels.

4. Last time I checked, a hug was around the waist. Raphtalia has her arms around Naofumi's neck.

5. Naofumi wouldn't have been so embarressed when everyone barged in. This is the first time we see Mr. Badass blush! I don't think he'd blush from a hug.

6. If it was a hug, we would've seen at least a hint of Naofumi's lips. I don't know about you, but I see absolutely no lips in the shot (meaning those suckers are on Raphtalia)!

7. The fact that Melty refused. This is a stretch, but with how friendly they've gotten, Melty should've at least been ready for a hug. A kiss? Not so much.

8. Everyone, including Filo, walked in from behind. The mere fact that the ""camera"" angle is from behind is the origin of this whole debate! But, as Filo is still little, (BEAR WITH ME) she probably doesn't even know what a kiss is, as in 24 episodes, we have seen no two people press their lips together.

9. It's the classic isekai trope! Shield Hero was not your average isekai, but in MOST isekai, the MC gets a harem, am I wrong? Well, what's an isekai without at least one kiss from a girl?

So, you convinced yet? I hope you are. If you still believe they hugged, then please disprove every single one of my points in the comments. Thank you, and I've said what I needed to say.

frzkl1,LotysPrince,Need help finding an old VHS movie from my childhood.,"(On my phone so sorry for formatting)
As the title says, theres an old vhs I used to watch as a kid. It was definitely a movie made before 2000, whether it had a tv series or not I have no ideas.

I don't remember much so some of these details may be incorrect and I dont remember anything of the plot but I remember it being a mix of giant mechas and monsters? It was super gory with tons of blood. The most memorable scene I remember is this super way too intense sensory-overload type scene in a dance/strip club and all of a sudden a bunch of the other people just erupted into these monster transformations? That scene may have also had a little bit of pornographic stuff going on if I remember correctly?

The main character maybe had black/brown medium length messy hair and I'm pretty sure he ended up dying in the end while inside his mech which I wanna say was red and I also wanna say I remember him having a super long head like a character from Katamari Damacy?

I know this isn't super descriptive plot-wise and very unsure but its been bugging me all day and I'm hoping someone else knows this because I would love to go back and watch it again, I remember thinking it was really cool to watch.",3,1585603416,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frzkl1/need_help_finding_an_old_vhs_movie_from_my/,anime,1

frz279,Burnouts3s3,How do you judge an Anime of the Season for a show that lasts over 2 cours or seasons?,"I notice there's a lot of back and forth when it comes to declaring an ""Anime of the Season"". However, I'm curious as to how one can judge a show by this metric if it lasts over 2 seasons. For example, Vinland Saga premiered July of 2019 which can be considered the Summer, but ended on December of 2019 which would indicate the end of the Fall Season.

Is Vinland Saga compared to other shows of the Summer Season or to the shows in the Fall Season? Would a series such as Mai Hime be compared to other shows in Fall 2004 or shows in Spring 2005 to determine Anime of the Season?

Obviously, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, No Guns Life has 24 episodes listed but its scheduling is split apart when the first 12 episodes debuted in the Fall of 2019 while the remaining 12 will premiere in Spring of 2020.

And certain shows that run longer are exempt such as Ascendance of the Bookworm having 14 episodes, it's still considered a Fall anime. Ongoing series, such as Black Clover, are exempt from this rule. I'm more referring to shows that have 24 through 26 episodes that end on a different Season than which they began.",2,1585601717,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frz279/how_do_you_judge_an_anime_of_the_season_for_a/,anime,1

The watch order of the movie is a hot topic, to not take away from the WT itself I've talked about it in depth in [this]() comment alongside future reading.

---

This WT will include premise based spoilers of the series. Due to the popularity/notoriety of the series and how well known all of these things are and the integral nature that these spoilers contain to the story, I don't think this WT would be complete without them. None of these are twists in any way, and all of them are presented within the first 3-4 episodes of the series. They will still be tagged as such in the text.

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a high school based slice of life series written by Nagaru Tanigawa starting in 2003 that incorporates almost all of the well known tropes of a modern slice of life (not iyashikei) while still not making it feel samey and uninspired through a unique presentation and scenario that many other series try to replicate yet fall short on. Following the five main characters, Haruhi Suzumiya, Kyon, Yuki Nagato, Koizumi Itsuki, and Mikuru Asahina you go through these slice of life shenanigans that happen in a majority of the episodes in the series, you go through all of them with a sense of existential dread about the consequences of their actions with regards to the titular character's mindset.

Kyon is the perspective character of the series, with all events that go on coming through his eyes to you as the viewer. The hallmark of the series is his narration throughout, acting as the straight main for the group amid Haruhi's antics. Haruhi herself is an eccentric girl who lives her life in search of the supernatural, in particular the existence of Aliens, Time Travelers, and Espers. Kyon, getting himself dragged into her plans to do, sets up a club with her, the The **S**aving The World By **O**verloading It With Fun Haruhi **S**uzumiya Brigade, or otherwise the **SOS** Brigade. [Integral Spoilers](/s ""As luck would have it, each of the other three main characters happen to fall into one of the previously mentioned supernatural characteristics, and Haruhi herself is the target of each of their intrigue as it is revealed that she has some form of godlike powers. In order to prevent a subconsious change in the world the group here works to prevent Haruhi from ever finding out about any supernatural elements of the world."")

Interspersed with the slice of life goings on, the series contains a serious storyline, focusing on the actions of the three other main characters and their role in joining the club and interacting with Haruhi. Throughout the series you're presented with outside challenges, conflicting mindsets, and direct altercations, of which absolutely none can Haruhi find out about. And all of this is delivered in completely different ways, with different levels of Kyon trusting the speaker between the timid and endearing Mikuru, the cold and calculating Yuki, and the mysterious and aloof Koizumi.

A major theme that the series presents is the idea of being good enough, not necessarily in one specific thing but in life in general. The idea to stand out and make something of yourself, because if you don't were you even alive? This ideal is what drives Haruhi to do the things she does, and in turn drives the story of the series in understanding her mentality and how it changes with new information and relationships gained throughout. As with any teenager emotion drives her heavily, with jealousy, anger, pride, curiosity, and joy coming out often to determine what she does.

The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is the first major arc that brings focus to another character besides Haruhi (as per the title). Tonally more cold and serious, the movie takes a deep dive into the mindset of a character that you wouldn't think would have much of a mindset at all, Yuki Nagato. Throughout the movie you follow Kyon trying to figure out what exactly caused Haruhi to disappear and how he can fix it, along with whether he even believes the situation to be worth fixing, with Yuki as his closest bridge to his previous life.

What the movie does is really bring out the absolute best of the series itself, excelling in all the manners that the series already did and cutting fluff for introspection and monologuing, the movie's presentation, color, animation, and music all work together to present arguable one of, if not the best animated movie of all time. With Kyon going alone, the cold feel of the movie works to enhance his solitude, the quietness of the soundtrack (about half of the runtime of the movie contains music, a mixture of original pieces by Satoru Kousaki and classical pieces of Erik Satie) brings only his thoughts to the forefront. The color motif of the movie displaying a strong contrast in the use of orange and blue when appropriate and the animation is no slouch either, remaining smooth and consistent throughout. [Plus the art is just absolutely gorgeous.](https://i.imgur.com/KyJvNn9.jpg) The movie is a full package deal that really tops off what was animated from this series and truly presents something incredible.",16,1585598415,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fry124/wt_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/,anime,1

frxt2f,PineapplePanda_,Is Psycho-Pass demeaning towards women?,"I'm looking for some opinions to weigh in on this debate. I recently began to re-watch this anime with my fiancee after seeing it initially years ago.

I remember the story being captivating. The world being dark, gritty and disturbing. While the characters were decently complex as was their development.

Upon completing episode 7 she told me how she felt the show was demeaning towards women. While I am not entirely convinced I can see where she is coming from.

I ask anyone not spoil anything past episode 7 as we will continue watching it!

**This was her argument:**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Although Psycho-Pass has an interesting story and concept of moral ethics in a dystopian society, it‚Äôs creators are abusive and dehumanizing towards the female sex. Throughout the first few episodes of the series, the viewers are constantly shown scenes of women brutality and nudity in ways of rape, bondage, abuse, and objectification. In the very first episode, we find a criminal has taken a ‚Äúpretty young girl‚Äù hostage and intends to rape her after already having beaten her. Whether she was actually raped or not, we find that her criminal coefficient has risen due to the stress of the situation and it is deemed that she is as guilty as her rapist/kidnapper. She is no longer considered a victim or hostage. She is a target. Her life is saved by the main character female lead, Akane. Sure this was the first episode and the creators needed to draw in viewers by showing how gritty and dark the show is.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; One can look past the criminal story here and accept the reality of it. But as the show continues, it becomes obvious that the creators are intentionally or subconsciously reflecting their true feelings about how insignificant women are to them.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
In episodes 6 and 7, we find young underage school girls being stripped, dismembered, and showcased like an art piece. Their bodies are fully nude and objectified, whereas when compared to the Specimen case victims, we don‚Äôt even know if they were nude or if their assets were exposed for the world to see. The murderer of these school girls is also a fellow student whose obsessed with her late father‚Äôs obscene artwork which portrays the female body as nothing more than a disfigured piece of art. The mentally disturbed student not only showcases her victims for the town to see, she also sleeps with their dead naked bodies. Why? Why is this significant to the plot line? It‚Äôs not. Throughout these episodes, each young girls‚Äô body is exposed, dismembered, bonded and clearly demeaned and devalued.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The creators of this show have not shown any respect or honor to the female figure in any form, especially none to underage school girls. They have only shown women to be nothing but a fetish-filled sex symbol or play toy. Even the women in the law enforcement group have failed to develop any significant, meaningful roles. There is one female enforcer who is nothing short of a 2D character with no emotions or dialogue, along with the promiscuous lab analyst whose sole purpose is to show off her tits. And then there is Akane. The newest addition to the group, yet the most weakest and submissive. With no shred of self confidence and always doubting herself, she has given no strength to the female persona. She simply does as she is told. The first episode was the only insight to a possible character growth that is yet to be seen.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The men on the other hand are portrayed as knowledgeable and suave characters who have no real flaws. Even when Kogami was remembering his deceased partner, he mentioned how he was a womanizer and would grab the butts of his female coworkers, but that personality trait was overshadowed by how much he was missed by Kogami. The fact that the death of a womanizing man was worth obsessing over vengeance for makes Kogami‚Äôs pain admirable and understandable. As if it‚Äôs okay to be a womanizer as long as you‚Äôre remembered fondly or held a career that helped the greater good. The creators of this story have no respect or value for women. They‚Äôre portrayal of the female sex is downright distasteful and unnecessary for the plot line. It is simply for their own pleasure.

&amp;#x200B;

**My argument:**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The crimes portrayed and their brutality are not there just to objectify and demean women. They are there to demonstrate the brutality and disturbing nature of them. Why are schoolgirls being chopped up and not men? That's the artistic direction the creators wanted to go down. Kogami's previous partner was brutalized. Although yes he was not decorated as the schoolgirls were.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The woman who was being raped and no longer being considered a victim is there to demonstrate the flaw of the Sibyl system. To show it is not perfect and can be wrong. It should make you feel conflicted and disturbed. The creators are not saying she is too blame, they're saying that is the WRONG way to think. I feel they're saying she is the victim and not to blame, as Akane steps in to ensure that is what happens.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
Akane is still young and has a lot to learn. She has not yet solved any cases on her own or contributed in a significant manner but she is demonstrated to have a strong moral and ethical compass. She trusts in her co-workers, is fostering her relationships with them well and wants to make an impact. As it is only episode 7 it is early to say she is weak. IF she is indeed weak that is the point of character development. To change a character. My memory is hazy but I definitely remember her becoming stronger as time goes on.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
I do agree the other female characters so far are weak and 2D. 7 episodes in I also expected a little more from Kunizuka and Karanomori than just their sexual relationship defining them. However Kogami is also sexualized as seen in multiple shirtless scenes. I feel the anime is just dark and gritty. I understand how it may come off in such a manner to women.

I am hoping to rectify this with a rewatch here on this sub starting in 6 days time (5th of April). This is the 6 day reminder thread...it was supposed to be a 7 day reminder but I kinda forgot.


#***But what is Giant Robo?***

Giant Robo is a Wuxia inspired super powered melodrama that pits [the Experts of Justice Vs. Big Fire's Magnificent Ten.](https://youtu.be/F7DYq68d2HY) Our hero Daisaku, and his Giant Robo, joins the fight when the dastardly Genya joins forces with Big Fire in order to bring the world to its knees. Throughout the show the two sides face off is Giant Robot battles, super powered kung fu fights, and full on brawls. Using the full range of emotions it explores themes of light &amp; dark, family inheritance, and the central question of whether happiness can be achieve without sacrifice. Whether you're here for the rollicking adventure, the interesting character development, or the engaging themes this show has a little bit of everything for everyone.

#***But why should I watch this show Dave?***

**1. It was direct by Imagawa**

[Yasuhiro Imagawa](https://myanimelist.net/people/3710/Yasuhiro_Imagawa) is generally considered to be one of the best directors this medium has ever seen. He is a master of melodrama who hits that knifes edge of having a utterly ridiculous scenes that are filled with so much genuine emotion that the viewer just accepts the whole thing. He is a visual genius with the way he blends shot elements, uses camera placement, and edits his cuts together. He also has a really unique voice as he is a massive [wuxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia) fan and his mixing of Chinese &amp; Japanese styles leads to utterly unique results. Much like the show itself Imagawa is a favourite of many people who have been in the anime fandom for a long time and his involvement alone makes this show worth watching.

**2. It is absolutely drop dead gorgeous.**

This show took almost ten years to make and it is only 7 episodes long. The amount f time and effort put into this shows as it is a [technical marvel](https://sakugabooru.com/data/75aeab2f8bfdfa9cc1ce322ec1207db6.mp4). But it isn't only beautiful on a technical level but also on a design level. Due to some bizarre rights issue they weren't allowed to use any of the characters from the original manga except for the titular robot and the main character. Unfazed Imagawa asked the mangaka if he could simply use the characters from his other manga instead, to which the mangaka agreed. As such this show features character from ancient China, 50s Japan, mythical beasts, and much more. These elements are disparate but Imagawa weaves them together into a believable retro-future world that feels coherent. It is a massive feat and one that pays off for the viewer.

**3. It is really really good.** 

I know it seems simplistic to say but this show is just really good. I personally think it is the greatest anime ever made and I know a good proportion of the people who have seen it think the same thing. This show isn't spoken of in hushed whispers by the old timers for nothing!

Those three key reasons are but a part of way you should join this rewatch and take a look at this show.

fruo6n,ruknot,"Watched anime for half a year, here is my top list. Hope you find something for yourself"," (Contains minor spoilers!)

Alright, this list will be sorted by genres. (All of the titles will have a hyperlink to MyAnimeList)

Slice of life

[Imouto sae Ireba Ii.](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35413/Imouto_sae_Ireba_Ii)

*In my opinion, this is the most underrated anime that I have watched so far. Most people drop the show after the first 3 minutes of the show for, let's say reasons...... But if you continue watching you will be up for a huge treat!*

The story follows a life of the MC that is obsessed with little sister x big brother love. The plot is centered around novel writers and their lives, what else you expect from a slice of life?

*In my opinion, this is the best slice of life out there and I highly recommend you to watch it.*

Emotional (Ah yes, enforced depression)

[Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai. (Anohana)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai)

*This was my #1 anime for a long time. It's truly amazing.*

Jinta Yadomi is a normal lock-in MC until he is being met by his childhood friend, Menma. Jinta wasn't happy meeting her but Menma said that she will leave after he can fulfill her biggest wish. You will see Jinta and his childhood friends trying to reunite and make Menma's wish come true.

*Before watching get some tissues and prepare crying just by hearing 5 seconds of Secret Base, depression for a week is a guarantee.*

Supernatural[Charlotte](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28999/Charlotte)

You get yourselves a highschool, you get yourselves some students with superpowers, you get yourselves a club, pretty basic right? How about a high school that hides students with superpowers with a club that fights the government to save the students from being scientists' guinea pigs?  
Yea that still sounds pretty basic but it is amazing!

[Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20359/Yamada-kun_to_7-nin_no_Majo)

You get yourselves a highschool, you get yourselves some students with superpowers, you get yourselves a club, pretty basic right? Well, this is it this is the anime. You get yourselves an inside school club that is trying to figure out why the fuck are there witches on campus.

[Boku dake ga Inai Machi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi)

Our MC, Satoru Fujinuma has a power that can sense an incoming disaster. That way he saved a lot of lives so far, but this time it sends him far into the past, right before a murder of a lot of kids by a man that was never found. Follow the MC trying to save everyone in a very interesting trilogy.

Philosophical

[Angel Beats!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats)

*This anime literally saved me. This is the anime that changed me as a whole, didn't cure my chronic depression but saved my life(and hopefully someone else's. I became an organ donor because of it.*

The plot is super basic in the beginning, you get yourselves a group of students that spawned at a school after death and protest god from going to heaven. I hope you will get passed that because after that you are getting punched with so many things to process that it is unbearable to fully understand it in one go. Also, you get a complete amazing ending that is the most beautiful thing that I have seen.

[Violet Evergarden](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden)

*Mixed feelings guaranteed*

This anime is about a weapon of war after war, marines are told that they are the weapon, not their rifle. This anime shows what happens when the weapon knows nothing but war, and what happens to it after it is decommissioned. You will follow a young beautiful woman that is trying to establish herself after the war and become an ""Auto Memory Doll"" to achieve her goal of understanding emotions.

[**Akame ga Kill!**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22199/Akame_ga_Kill)

*I will say it here and now, in MY OPINION this anime is better than Re:Zero season 1.*

You will follow the story of a young man and his companions fighting for the revolutionary forces to end the corrupt government after seeing what the capital really is like.

[Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu)

*Do I even have to talk about it?*

A guy gets isekaid and thinks that he is in heaven. Instead, he is being thrown into a huge clan war for the right to the throne in which he constantly needs to battle with himself, the people who are dear to him, and A LOT of strong enemies. But he has a secret power that saves him every time, doesn't make it easier for his nerves though.

[Classroom of the Elite](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35507/Youkoso_Jitsuryoku_Shijou_Shugi_no_Kyoushitsu_e_TV)

*Ah yes, another highschool anime.*

You get yourself a highschool of super-smart students that need to stay in it no matter what. All you see is them fighting among each other and it's super amusing. Watch it!

Movies

[I want to eat your pancreas](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36098/Kimi_no_Suizou_wo_Tabetai)

A lonely MC that is detached from the world and has no emotions one day meets his fellow classmate in the clinic, there he accidentally discovers that she is sick and doesn't have a long time to live. She makes him her best friend and asks him to help her spend as much time as possible as happy as she can.

[**Kimi no Na wa.**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa)

One day two highschool students wake up in each other's bodies and after they go to sleep they forget everything that happened on it. They have to figure out how to communicate and how to live with it. But Mitsuha, one of the students is always talking about the comet she wants to see dearly......

P.S If you read this far I am super grateful. I have spent a good 20 hours at least composing this list, writing and rewriting it constantly until I thought it was somewhat not bad. I know a lot of people are going to have some disagreements with me but I really hope I helped someone.

fru4vn,imaprince,Tower of God; Opening up a New World for Anime and Why People are Excited. (And Why You Should Watch.),"When I read that Tower of God was getting an anime, I knew hell had well and truly frozen over. There were numerous reasons as to why a reasonable person would think that Tower of God, or TOG as I will be calling it as a shorthand, would never get an anime.¬†

It's a Webtoon/Manhwa from a Korean creator which was started in 2010, released on Webtoons for free weekly. That alone is a good reason to assume that TOG would never get an anime, as the only exception was Noblesse which only got an OVA.¬†

But, lo and behold, through Crunchyroll, what was thought impossible has become reality. This is a true first ever.¬†

But, that alone isn't an explanation as to why people are excited about TOG. If you've hopped into one of r/Anime threads since the announcement of the anime, you've probably heard TOG described as ""Korean One Piece"".

Now, I like this description because, gods fuck with gods, most people would agree that One Piece is excellent and I as well have One Piece as my favourite manga ever and Tower of God as my 2nd favorite. I think they're both 10/10 series.¬†

But I also hate the description because it doesn't tell you much, and is a bit misleading in terms of tone.¬†

I would say TOG is more similar to Hunter x Hunter than anything. In terms of tone and genre at least, it has a similar level of levity and darkness intertwined. But still, simply comparing one series to another isn't good enough for a recommendation in my eyes, I need to tell you the strengths that have made TOG such a beloved story that it is still going 400+ chapters strong.¬†

For me, TOG's biggest strength is the author's masterful characters and characters interactions throughout the whole story.¬†

What truly made me fall in love with TOG was a small thing in the first season, which was what it did different from many stories I have read. Many series have the world revolve around the protagonist, or the protagonist's morality. It tends to be be the norm. 

That just isn't how the author, SIU, writes characters. Our three main protagonists of Season 1, Bam, Khun, and Rak all have different philosophies and morals, and they clash and fight and go around each other while still being friends who care about each other. When I read TOG, I truly feel like I'm reading from an author that has a great emotional range or social understanding. It's a joy. 

Not to mention that TOG has a wide variety of characters and species due to its amazing worldbuilding, which I will get to in a bit. I am sure you noticed that one of the characters is an alligator and another is a lizard if you looked at a promo image.¬†

That alone would be enough of a hook to get one into TOG, but actually TOG is quite a plot driven story. In fact, it's impossible to talk about anything following Season 1 of TOG without spoilers, so I won't.

But Tower of God has the extraordinary working in its favor with how its first season is written. The first season is a complete box. It has a booming beginning that leaves us curious about the world, a building middle that answers some of our questions and makes one fall in love with the characters, and a satisfying end. Unlike many series that tend to fall on their face in adaptations, TOG doesn't rely on heavy internal narration, rather a more show and then explain brand of storytelling. Similar to Attack on Titan. And the series doesn't rely on it's visuals either,(The anime is a direct upgrade from the first season's visuals from the PVs we've seen so far.)¬†

Even if this experiment ends with only the first season adapted, it will still be a complete satisfying story for those who don't want to read the source.¬†

Now let me tell you about TOGs worldbuilding before I hit 1000 words. Worldbuilding can be a bit of a meme in terms of describing why a series is good. That's why I saved it for last.¬†

It's fantastic. People who compare TOG to One Piece likely do it due to their similarities in creating large wide spanning worlds, with so much to see and explore and learn about that it makes every nerd blush. As someone who has read the wikis for both, I am guilty of loving worldbuilding too. Tower of God is about climbing a tower with countless floors to become a Ranker, a being that essentially to our definitions would be a god. They can get anything they desire, they stop aging, they have power beyond belief, being a ranker is like becoming a billionaire. And to be a ranker, you must climb to the top of the tower at any costs. So, talented individuals of countless different creeds with countless different desires climb the tower competing with each other.¬†

It's a world built to be full of interesting characters clashing against each other, and TOG is indeed that.¬†

I haven't even gotten into the power system but I'll end it here.¬†

Tower of God comes out this Wednesday, April 1th, on Crunchyroll. You should give it a watch. If it's successful, it could be the start of not just a popular series, but a avalanche of great Webtoons/Manwha getting animated.¬† 

**TLDR: Amazingly human character interaction, great worldbuilding that'll have you scouring a wiki like a WOW diehard in 2005, will bring New Waves tm if successful.**",133,1585586253,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fru4vn/tower_of_god_opening_up_a_new_world_for_anime_and/,anime,1

&gt;\- Prologue

Due to how the writing unpacks mysteries, I actually recommend going in blind. But if you need more info as to whether to pick up this series, I hope this post will help.

TLDR;

while Season 1 is merely a prelude to a bigger story, you will enjoy Tower of God S1 if you like

1. **Extensive world building and mystery**, where some characters and systems mentioned will have relevance years later in the story
2. **Test systems,** **Action &amp; strategy**, with a diverse cast of well-loved side characters
3. **A relatively serious storyline with a dash of humour and dark turns**, as well as an overarching plot that leads to the next seasons of ToG. Look forward to some hilarious scenes!

# Plot

&gt;""Climb the Tower, and everything will be yours. At the top of the Tower exists everything in this world. Welcome, to the Tower of God""  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Anime trailer narration

Tower of God is an Epic / Dark Fantasy series, with large scale events, settings, cast, unresolved mysteries, and some moral ambiguity.

**SUMMARY**

Personally, a story that can match the vastness and mystery of Tower of God are very few and far between. 

The story starts with a [mysterious abandoned boy ""Baam"" stuck in a magical cave](https://imgur.com/a/GwFBajG), unable to leave, and the only person, ""Rachel"", who found and took care of him. She is his friend, caretaker, teacher, and everything in the world, so when she leaves to pursue her dreams in the Tower, [he tried to follow](https://gfycat.com/scrawnyopencod), and enters the Tower.

We then follow Baam, who knows nothing about the tower. As the story progresses, we gradually learn about the system, rules, inhabitants, cruelty, the [10,000+ years' worth of history that made the Tower what it is today](https://imgur.com/xVNsZpQ), and the desires of its people moving forward.

The Tower is rooted in a ""Winner Take All"" culture. As Baam moves forward, he [integrates with the Tower inhabitants who are chosen to climb the Tower](https://imgur.com/DVoNJ5g), takes lessons and [tests](https://imgur.com/p4AZUp3) with them, [received help from various characters](https://imgur.com/SO5OGbb), while trying to outwit [challenges](https://imgur.com/tUjV3bG) and unseen enemies that comes his way.

As the plot progresses, we will later learn how the consequences of these events ties into the overall political fate of the Tower.

**MYSTERY &amp; WORLD BUILDING**

A strong point of this story is the [unwrapping of mysteries](https://imgur.com/aWVQNgU), something which I thoroughly enjoyed. As you progress through the story, you start out with a blank slate just like the MC, and learn more about the Tower, but just enough to keep you hooked and ask more questions. Why is the MC stuck in the cave?  [Who is Rachel](https://imgur.com/qrzDfSk)? Why are the [weapons](https://imgur.com/llURMS2) so significant? [What is going to happen](https://imgur.com/tXzUUA4)? Each hint leads to another question, and makes the fans hooked.

**ACTION &amp; STRATEGY**

One of the highlights of Season 1, which sets it apart even from the current arcs of Tower of God, is how much the characters [have to rely on wit](https://imgur.com/5GQ9sNv) to overcome their disadvantages in battle. The little plot twists and actions spices things up, and definitely is one of the highlights of the season. You honestly never know what to expect, and that's what people liked about this.

**SOURCE MATERIAL**

What makes this stand out from other fantasy stories, is that the author is [very dedicated to the world building](https://towerofgod.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:GoDai/GoDai%27s_Translations:_People_and_Groups_in_the_Tower_(1)#Rankings). His post-chapter notes and blog posts about the lore of the Tower often reveal how far ahead he had planned (sometimes up to 7 years in advance). To me, it is a joy to discuss the hints and possibilities with the discord community on r/TowerofGod.

As a place that has been around for a long time, the Tower has much to offer. You first hear about the ruling system and families in Season 1, and later each family will have their time to shine as the characters climb up the Tower. Different factions oppose each other, and even as they are elaborated further, they are still consistent and tie back to the main story. This coherent storytelling, well laid out since Season 1, is what makes Tower of God so addictive to many.

Basically, this is not the ""run of the mill"" story that gradually runs out of materials and starts repeating itself. In fact, Tower of God is merely one part of an even larger Talse Uzer Story (TUS) universe. If you like vast world building, predicting, and fantasising about possibilities, then this is the story for you.

# Characters

Baam is not the typical shonen MC. He is mysterious in of himself. No one knows much about his origins and background, not even himself. He is likeable, kind and polite, perhaps a little naive, but [forms organic relationships as he goes along](https://gfycat.com/unitedwatchfulflycatcher). He has some unexplained talents, though still weak overall, is good natured and willing to learn. He's not pushy, but still have some charisma that attracts others, which is well liked by many, both in story and in real life. 

Many of the Tower inhabitants try to climb the tower as well, who makes up most of the side characters. Despite the ""[dog eat dog world](https://imgur.com/TCJnFvz)"", there are moments of peace as the characters befriend each other, leading to some funny scenes and interactions. It is a good balance of sombreness and some good laughs. The comical scenes are definitely worth watching! 

**THEMES**

Aside from funny bantering scenes, the idea of ""devotion"" is explored in between characters, namely between [Baam and Rachel](https://imgur.com/KcRGyel), and other characters. The characters form bonds, and their [emotional state](https://imgur.com/S8xuB4E) is explored in a meaningful way, for example, how insecurity, inequality, desperation and loneliness lead to certain behaviours. Or how the ""winner take all"" culture changed their mentality from their initial deposition. These, in my opinion, is what makes it different from mainstream stories.

""Good"" and ""Evil"" also isn't very clear cut in the story, some characters have questionable past. Even with those, most don't justify their actions, and they are not necessarily ""villains"" of the story, especially when you look at the big picture. I think these well-written, nuanced, mature perspectives, rather than a straightforward black and white worldview, is what appealed to me.

**SIDE CHARACTERS**

[There is a large cast of characters](https://gfycat.com/crazysorrowfulhatchetfish), and many of them proved to be well loved by the fans, with their distinct motivations, personalities, and history, some of them gruesome. Most have ""abandoned"" something before climbing the Tower. Many of the side characters have [their own backstory](https://imgur.com/qFDklPl), that isn't just ""mentioned once and thrown to the back of the mind"". More often than not, these stories will come into play or further elaborated again years down the road, as they serve to illustrate a bigger part of the story.

Also, as a female fan, I appreciate the relative lack of female sexualisation in the series, similar to Shingeki no Kyojin. Female characters in this story often hold the upper echelons of power, have their own personalities, as well as central roles to play in the plot, like [Yuri Jahad](https://imgur.com/e45D2vW).

# Animation &amp; Art

One notable aspect of this anime is the distinct art style, frequently featuring [line filters, Kagenashi (shadowless) techniques and watercolour backgrounds](https://i.imgur.com/99ykJZW.jpg). This is a nod to the original art style of the manhwa, which [improved tremendously](https://imgur.com/gallery/fxbQdYW) as time passes. Personally it gave me Studio Ghibli vibes, and I have heard some comparing the art style to Shinsekai Yori or Devilman Crybaby, so if you like those you might like this too!

The [action scenes](https://gfycat.com/oddballdirtyhoopoe) seem relatively fluid, and it'll definitely be a treat to watch. Funnily enough, there's still some... [""misleading"" scenes](https://gfycat.com/spitefulbreakablehagfish), though fans are probably not complaining.

# Why watch Tower of God?

Essentially Season 1 is merely a gateway, an exposition for many much bigger things to come. The series changes its focus as the story progresses. It has gradually shifted from Hunter x Hunter / My Hero Academia style of lessons and tests in S1, to One Piece style of world building in S2, and to Shingeki no Kyojin style of large scale political conflicts in S3.

Overall, you will like the Tower of God series as a whole if you enjoy:

1. Discussing mysteries and detailed, well planned world building with the community
2. Diverse characters, with moral ambiguities and mysterious allegiances
3. Wits and political fights, and being part of a journey to bring about change

This is just the start of a great story!",3,1585586199,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fru49n/wt_tower_of_god_airing_on_apr_1st/,anime,1

Only thing I remember.. the song is about war, only lyric I remember was ""why people fight/argue each other"" or smth like that. 

I havent watch any anime for about 4-5 years so consider that for your guess (maybe the anime older than that) 

I don't think I'll remember the anime title anymore if you can comment the song name and artist I would recognized it faster cuz I used to listen to the song hundreds of time back then

its been 2 months since I finished Gintama but I had a few doubts about Takasugi's motivation

1.When he tells Gintoki to avenge sensei when they fight does he mean that since Gintoki took Shoyos's life to save Takasugi and katsura's by killing Takasugi he would avenge sensei?

2.also the scene when Takasugis beast asks why he doesn't avenge sensei it's talking to Takasugi right?

3.finally the reason Takasugi attacks Gintoki instead of himself is because he knew that he would have done the same thing and he wants to kill the other him that did the deed?

4.one final thing I don't understand is why Gintoki says it""that's why you're trying to cut down an enemy that hurts fare more than cutting down yourself right?""

frsrbv,Dozeris,"If you haven't seen ""Planetes"" give it a go. I will tell you why it is worth a shot without spoiling it.","***Damn it.***  
Just give it a shot because this is one of the most amazing series that I have watched through my 10 years career of watching anime. I want to write this recommendation in the most objective sense that it is possible so, I will try not to include personal feelings or taste to this show.  ^((if possible))

First of all, anime is an art form for me. The same as movies or theatre itself. There are good and bad shows and it doesn't matter if you like one or hate another, but the good show is the one who can portray the reality and make protagonists deal with an actual problem in the most sensible way that it is possible. It must be natural and real, not in the sense of reality itself, but in the sense of sensibility. Do not misunderstand me, any genre can portray what I talked about, it just the matter of how creator deals with the cards that he's been given.

&amp;#x200B;

***Characters:***  
There are so many characters in this show, but every each one of them feels unique and polished. They have their own different goals, values, dreams that make them pretty much - distinctive, which is pretty rare to find in a lot of shows. I am sure that the other shows has it too, but they tend to forget about this ***distinctive*** quality. All of the characters have a natural progress and the way how they deal with their each own problem makes them connected in some sort of sense. Each character has a great development that we can see throughout 26 episodes. They fully progress to the point that it feels just satisfying watching the end of the show.

***Plot/Ideas:***  
There will be no spoilers, but I have to tell you about this sensibility/reality that I talked before. The plot progressed naturally and characters responded to it sensibly as it should be. One of the important things that the ideas have not been lost in the middle of the show, but they were relevant in each episode till the very end. The second thing is that the people choices were ""real"" in the presence of given ideas and story itself. It makes the show interesting with unexpected out comings and feeling that maybe you would have chosen the same action. You start to relate with the events and people in the show so it makes it enjoyable and even beneficial. They stayed truthful to the existing ideas in this show.

*^(I just love how David Lynch talks about ideas,)* *^(""The ideas dictate everything, you have to be true to that or you're dead."")*

***Pacing:***  
I like to think of it as a time given to the world building and characters. It was nearly perfect. It felt that there is no redudant episodes. It was the time given to explore each value of his own, the connection between the ideas and world building.

***Problems:***  
I do not want to repeat myself and just use ""reality"" at any moment given, but the problems were actually relatable to our surroundings and it showed how human can perceive it and try to deal with it in the ***way*** that they were *built*. Even more important thing is that each problem had *logical* consequences which is a ***must*** to make us feel connected.

***Animation:***  
I guess it is more of a personal taste, but it is fluid and portrays the emotions well. It is more than enough for me.

***Overall:***  
As I said, this is a ***good*** show. For me it means that this is beneficial for you. You can catch yourself at times when you make an attempt to perceive this show through your heart and mind. It is rare to find such gems, but here you are.

I rate it ***4/5***   ^(I want to give it 5/5, but I do not think it holds the title of ""masterpiece"". I do not know if any show holds it.)

Then, I discovered subs, and never looked back. But to this day, I can't watch either of those movies in Japanese. It just feels **SO** wrong lol.

If I had to put an explanation to it, I'd say I feel like Japanese voice actors put more power/emotion behind their lines, which really dramatizes things for me. English voice actors do great, and there are some dubs I can stand, but overall I find dubs to be lacking a certain ""magic"" that pairs with the anime I'm watching.

frqedy,MasterSenseiSavage,Taboo Tattoo,"This post is not a discussion but just a exposition of my current mood.

Let me start by saying that I watched this anime when it first released years ago on Funimation however I did not remember it until today after I finished it...again.

Never in my entire life have I ever felt this level of *BEWILDERMENT* watching an anime. I‚Äôm not gonna lie , the first episode is what pulled me in. The action was amazing. However it wasn‚Äôt until episode 5 I realized just what the hell I had gotten myself into.

I feel *BAMBOOZLED* 

My current theory is that the monster who created this show developed this master plan to troll the audience, because that is the only logical explanation. The show starts off interesting with the great action , fan service, and plot. Then it just suddenly *STOPS*
It does this without any waging whatsoever, and now this is the phase where you enter the unescapable black hole that is Taboo Tatoo.

You have now entered a place in the anime where you are forced to watch it until the very end. Also please don‚Äôt worry, it gets much worse along the way. However you can not look away. You‚Äôll develop this impulse to see it through the very end and it‚Äôs just a complete circus. Absolutely zero things make sense . Nothing

I think the reason I don‚Äôt remember this anime is because my subconscious suppressed that memory as hard as possible. 

That is all , thanks for reading. Stay safe",2,1585573392,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frqedy/taboo_tattoo/,anime,1

Here is what I remember:

**Two girls are in a lesbian relationship I think. But they‚Äôre kinda hiding it. At some point, girl A (idk their names) gives girl B a necklace and tells her she like can‚Äôt take it off. Then girl B catches (sneaks into their apartment) girl A having some kind of interaction with her brother in the bedroom. Girl B runs away and gets on a train, but Girl A somehow magically appears there, and that interaction with her brother gets explained and they live happily ever after.**

But when I think about anime that I have connected to in the past, the film ***Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms*** and its ending that seamlessly made me weep.

Since then, I have been wondering if anyone else had a specific type of anime or story archetype that they really emoted to.

I am sorry if this isn't the right Reddit for this kind of question.
But I wanna start with getting into animes (actually I like them but they are so hard to find some which are not completely strange over the top).

I would love an anime in Samurai time period of Japan
I just saw this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSF5yoD-vC4 
and I really like the art style (except the faces and the blood - the blood doesn't look very good imo)

Is there any Samurai/Japan style anime you can suggest ?

frpbnz,Fawke_83,"What's the deal with the ""I don't like romance in shounen"" mentality?","So yeah, this is something I've seen popping more and more... The other day, I saw someone talking about Beastars (incredible anime btw) saying that they didn't care much about the main leads because they ""don't like romance in shounen"" (which was mind boggling for me, since the romance is easily one of the biggest subplots of the show, but alas). Same thing every time someone suggests a possible romance in a shonen (My Hero Academia was the one that came to mind right now, that I saw this kind of conversation), I see a bunch of people frown because... I don't know.

This is the point of my post, what is the reasoning behind this? Just because the focus of a story is battles (or whatever the thing it is), doesn't mean it can't have other stuff like romance, drama... If it's all in favor of the characters, and developing them, I don't see the bad in it. I mean, some of the most memorable stories and franchises have had romance as a big subplot, and they never suffered because of it (Harry Potter and Star Wars quickly spring to mind; anime as well, with Inuyasha and ).

I could understand saying that ""I think romance in shonens are badly executed"" or something of the sort, but the vibe that I get is pretty different, more of ""God forbid they put romance to distract me from seeing men beating each other"" (sorry for that, just  a little harmless joke xD), ""it's distracting"" feels like the predominant sentiment among general shonen fans. I just wanted to understand why is that, no judgment or anything, gimme your feedback on this folks.",42,1585568851,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frpbnz/whats_the_deal_with_the_i_dont_like_romance_in/,anime,1

For me I went in completely blind, like I did not know any memes for this at all so I was watching the first episode and then THAT part at the end when the girl turned around revealing the destroyed classroom, I was like ""What the fuck...What...the...fuck..."" followed by a ""Oh noooo... is she schizophrenic. Oh no..."" when the music played and the realization that everything that happened was to mislead the viewers.

froi78,asr4fil,Lost anime from the 90's," Hello, new member from Italy:

I am looking for an anime, probably an OVA, I once watched when I was a kid.

It was about a 90's badass type character, with Sunglasses and all, who had to get to the top of a skyscraper owned by some crime Syndacate. It was very gruesome. In the end he arrived to the last floor, where the boss was waiting for him (classic suit wearing middle aged baddie), they talk for a bit and then he throws himself crashing out of the window, rather than fighting.  
THe Main Character approaches the window and shoots the baddie right between the eyes, as he was falling, and then you could see the corpse crushing down on the street below, with some quasi x ray shots showing his skeleton going into pieces.

I don't remember much else... can anybody help me?",3,1585565080,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/froi78/lost_anime_from_the_90s/,anime,1

frnyvs,sirang_bolpen,[Discussion] I understand Anime onlies now,"Back then i was adamant about manga being better than the anime ‚Äî One Piece, Ranma 1/2, GTO, Golden Kamui and so on, like why be an anime only when you can jump to the manga to avoid spoilers? I save a lot of time by reading the pages than watching the anime and just watch the clips on YouTube. Plus I can read the panels/chapters that the anime skipped.        


Then I watched Gintama and Demon Slayer, but mostly Gintama is what made me realize this.         

With Demon slayer I was surprised how much padding that the anime added, it was a bizarre experience to compare the anime scenes to the manga panels, the anime made it better as I imagined it in my head based on how the scenes play out in the panels.        

Now with Gintama, I watched the first 100 episodes on Netflix, back then there used to be six seasons there iirc but now it's trimmed to two seasons. At first I was bummed out, turns out to be a blessing in disguise since I found out about fan translations later, 
 but other than that, I decided to skip to the manga since at the time wifi speed was really slow so i read ahead expecting the manga to be better.       

It felt too different, especially now I'm watching the episodes that adapted those chaptes, It's a completely different experience, it's not the same reading the joke than hearing it on the anime, the seiyuu and its delivery is too good! Also I'm surprised how the anime added so much content and based the 4th wall breaking comedy as anime rather than how it would be portrayed in the manga, at first I was miffed but realized the jokes won't be adapted well if the anime was too loyal to the manga.       

And the dramatic scenes, i wondered if i would've felt more emotion if i watched it as anime first rather than read it the pages, i felt a sense of ""waste"" since the anime would've delivered it better. Also I realized I would have laughed harder at the jokes if I first saw it in the anime rather have it ""spoiled"" for me in the manga.

I'll explain quickly why this title: I suffer from a psychological disorder (but I prefer not to talk about it openly) unfortunately hardly treatable but I ""learned"" to live with it. Getting to the point, I discovered that a strong release of emotions (in the form of tears) practically ""resets"" me and allows me to detach myself from this ailment and make me live well. I discovered this by watching Anime that make me explode emotions (happy or sad) making me cry a lot. I have seen many (which I am writing to you below) but now I need your help to add many others to my list of those to see (I am also writing this to you). I really love the genre Drama but it doesn't have to be a requirement for an anime. So, as the title suggests, I ask you to ""help me"" to make me cry.

Thank you very much to everyone!

frnavp,petrichormus,Why you need to watch Nami yo kiite kure,"First of all let me start by I am more of a manga reader. All anime I watch for the last 5 years have been those adapted from manga I like. I'm guilty of reading them through aggregator site though.

I love comedy series. I've read gintama, hinamatsuri, sket dance, grand blue, Saiki, and kaguya-sama. I must confess though that I believe I haven't seen every comedy series there is to begin with. All those I mentioned are my absolute favorites. The latest one being Nami yo kiite kure, written by renowned Samura Hiroaki. He brought up a fresh adult comedy to us this time around. Before I elaborate, I believe every comedy series played one structure as a backbone. 

Gintama played the absurdity and parody game. 
Grand blue played the exaggeration game. Hinamatsuri played the quirky main cast game. 
Saiki played the one man tsukkomi game. 
Sket dance played the quirky person of the week game. 
Kaguya sama played the rom com done right game. 

My opinion on this are not accurate, I tried to simplify them with one phrase so bear with me.

So what does Nami have?

It is a cohesive story full of practical jokes.

Nami is set in real life. It is about a waitress getting a job in radio industry because her drunken ramblings were recorded and aired in radio station. It's a SoL of an adult. God plays practical jokes on us from time to time in real life, and this is about an MC getting played by fate because honestly, she perfectly deserves it. She is an absolute riot. She is daring, embarassing, and full of openings, a perfect example of someone we like to see tripping.

She is the driving force of the story, but truthfully its because she doesn't have a choice but to drive it. Both her and her sorrounding moves the plot forward. A progression is apparent, not only Her but also the supporting cast. They realistically have a mind of their own, not because a gag demands it. I will bet that you will think that the MC and the supporting cast reminds you of someone you have met.



Just like every comedy series, a life lesson is slipped in. Gintama and hinamatsuri did it separately from gags. Others blend them together in one way or another. What about Nami?

There is none. We learn it from the character decisions. You will find yourself disagreeing to some character decision. You find yourself liking one trait of a character but not the other. The lesson are there in the form of your opinion:

""Man, If only I have/don't have that kind of behaviour"" 

Just like every adult we've met, the characters are teachers and anti-teachers in our life.



I absolutely adore the series. Especially in manga format. The first time I read it, I know this is not the type of manga to get an anime. It is full of irl references, inner thoughts on top of dialogue, and not so much movement. The anime also seems to end (based on PV) before we get to the best part of the story. If the anime doesn't hit you, I will understand why. I'm absolutely happy to see it get an anime, and I want to share with you why you should not skip this entirely. There's 4 days left until it premier, I hope we can share the fun.

frmqd3,Daviddv1202,What do I need to know before I start watching Dragon Ball Super?,"Okay, I have a confession to make... I've never seen Dragon Ball Z and never grew up with the series. Last night, I just saw Battle of the Gods. My friend on FB got me interested in the character Beerus. He told me while he hates Dragon Ball Z as a whole, he loves Beerus and that's when I got curious. I started watching the movie and Beerus was easily the best thing about it!

That's really the only reason I want to watch Dragon Ball Super. I want to watch the show for more of Lord Beerus! He's just so awesome! So when I saw the movie for the first time, though, I was met with a LOT of characters I didn't recognise so I was very confused. I only know a handful of things thanks to exposure of the internet such as how Vegeta used to be a major villain for Goku but eventually became a tsundere (And an awesome one at that! Tsuns are the best!), Chichi is Goku's wife whom he has a son with (First time seeing he has two sons and is now having a grandson soon!) and such. But before I go in, I would love to have a decent recap of the whole saga without having to watch ALL those shows. This is my problem.

I mainly want to watch Super for Lord Beerus, but I also don't want to be confused either. There's just... too many shows and seasons... I can't keep up with them. So maybe there's a YouTube video that explains the whole story of Dragon Ball Z before watching Super or maybe you can point me to a few movies which focus on the main points of the story without dragging the series out. Or even just a long list of recaps over here would be fine, to let me know everything so I can understand Super for Lord Beerus.

Also, when does the Dragon Ball Super: Broly movie take place in the series? I've heard that Resurrection F is a direct sequel to Battle of the Gods so I can move straight onto that right now to continue the story briefly. Still, I also like in-depth stories so I would like to watch the series too. This is why I asked for a good recap. Thank you so much! I'd love to see more Beerus because he's the best!",4,1585555402,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frmqd3/what_do_i_need_to_know_before_i_start_watching/,anime,1

They don't do anything interesting, the episodes mostly exist of Gentle &amp; La Brava talking about some sad backstory and in the end Deku fights him and he's ""stronger than anyone he's fought so far"" because of...the Power of Love (like literally, but still cmon)

I'm sorry but he just seems so pointless and uninteresting to me. His dialogues make me cringe inside out half the time as well. I feel like this entire arc could've just been 2-3 episodes of preparing the school festival and nothing of value would've been lost.

Some of the the latter half was almost too much for my weak heart to bare (in a good way) since I was so invested in all of the characters happiness not just Banri‚Äôs, but I was really satisfied after binging it. I really enjoyed the fact that we got to see Banri and Koko go through so much of an actual relationship, rather than an anime that builds to their relationship confession and then ends shortly after. I like stuff that has ‚Äúthe chase‚Äù or the prelude to a relationship, I mean that the whole premise of Love is War and I love it, but right now I want a relationship explored with a happy overall feel.

So my question is, any good recommendations like this? Even Golden Time had me wanting more after its pretty definite conclusion, I wanted to know more about how their lives went in college, who ended up with who, how Banri‚Äôs life ends up after the choices he made leading up to the finale. I just want some feel good anime that centers around a couple during their relationship not just leading up to it.

frldci,Pete26l96,"In your opinion, what makes an anime a masterpiece?","I've been reflecting on animes I've watched and the ratings I've given them on MAL. Although I know ratings don't mean much I find I struggle in differentiating between animes that are really good and animes that in my opinion are ""masterpieces"". 

For example, although I feel Death Note is a one of a kind and found the series extremely interesting / entertaining I gave it a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 because I felt the second half of the series didn't live up to the same standards as the first half. 

However now I just finished watching Code Geass and gave both seasons a 10/10 even though I enjoyed Death Note more, mainly because I felt for its respective genre that Code Geass was produced near perfectly. 

I'm going over my ratings now and rethinking a lot of things.

I don't know it's just I've seen so many times, someone saying something like ""you need to watch up to episode 60"" or something similar. Obviously this depends on the series and in some series the action does pick up after only a few episodes but still, I feel more often than not if someone doesn't doesn't find an anime interesting from the first couple of episodes they wont find it that great.

frkfvk,Drogaritory,Why do people say Bleach is repetitive while at the same time praising One Piece when it‚Äôs the most repetitive out of the Big 3?,"So some people basically say bleach is repetitive because the Hueco Mundo and Soul Society Arc are about Ichigo saving his female friend(completely different circumstances, but whatever) and the Visored arc and Fullbringer arc are about Ichigo learning a new ability from a new cast of characters(there literally is nothing similar between these two arcs other than that very broad plot summary). Everyone‚Äôs free to have their opinio but what kind of annoys me is when these same people turn around and praise One Piece, an anime/manga that has been doing the exact same thing over and over again since it first started.

The majority of one piece‚Äòs arcs can be summed up like this: Luffy and his crew go to an island for whatever reason, they discover an oppressor on that island, they meet a bunch of new, easily forgettable and underdeveloped side character, Luffy, his crew and these side characters take down the oppressor(but before this happens a multitude of annoying ass subplots that detract from the main story and fuck up the pacing are given to these side characters) and liberate the people living on the island, luffy and his crews bounty increases, side characters previously introduced react to Luffy‚Äôs new bounty, rinse and repeat. This is LITERALLY what happens for the majority of one piece, it‚Äôs not an oversimplification or a summary, that‚Äôs the exact plot structure of almost every arc in this series, yet people try and act like it‚Äôs doing some breaking bad shit or something.

frjx16,musty_max,Need help finding old anime,"[TOMT][MOVIE] old anime about a astronauts who land on a swamp planet

I have a very old memory from when I was a little kid. My mom got an old anime on a VHS tape from a free box at the video store. It could have been a movie or it might have been an episode of a TV show. It wasn‚Äôt in English so I couldn‚Äôt understand anything. I don‚Äôt remember much but I think there was a team of astronauts in futuristic space gear who landed on a swampy planet chasing a destress signal. One goes out of the ship and is killed by an unseen monster in the swamp. The visual of the spaceman floating upside down in the water with blood pooling our from him freaked me out so bad my mom returned it, but i never forgot that damn image. I would love to watch it again so anything helps! Thanks :)

EDIT: for extra clarity the tone of the show was very tense and slow, it wasn‚Äôt comedic or cartoony in any way",4,1585541103,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frjx16/need_help_finding_old_anime/,anime,1

There was a side character who only spoke via written signs since she was mute, and she was particularly hilarious.

I'd like to imagine an alternate 90's and 80's of dubbed anime where somebody like Orson Wells (of which was desperate for money) voiced a role in Gundam 0079 or maybe some 60's anime used some Hanna-Babera staff like Casey Kasem (OG Shaggy) voicing Speed Racer or something. (or did some Hanna-Babera staff dub that show? I don't know, it's been a while)


The medium of animation has more exaggerated voices and that's what I like about it and I know some of the samples I posted are very ""Lel, a Small Subpoena"" and ""lol, he wants to do her, but he's a robot now, those shows are better than I remember"" kinda nostalgia trip that's not specific to anime, but stay talking about anime.

fri5xh,Rhine14,NEED some new Anime to watch!,"Hello Everyone! 

I am trying to find some new Anime to watch since alot of stuff has popped up lately on Hulu and Netflix, I wanna know what would be worth watching based on some titles I've enjoyed so far.  

Just watched Bofuri and absolutely loved it, it was a riot, amazing 10/10. 

Ive watched and enjoy stuff like:
- Kiss Him, Not Me
- Magic Kun Renaissance 
- Fruits Basket (2019)
- K
-Durarara!!
-Haikyu!!
-Kuroku no Basket
-Boku no Hero

But I DONT like a lot of mainstream Animes like:
- Full Metal Alchemist
- Attack on Titan
- Yu Gi Oh
-Sailor Moon

....and the likes.

frhula,slurplurpsyrup,Does this happen to anyone else? A love you had once for a show starts to die out so you switch to different anime fandoms and don't feel like you belong in any specific fandom?,"So my first anime when I was a kid was pokemon and I was obsessed with it. I collected cards I would listen to the soundtracks, buy the games, and constantly think about pokemon. Once I reached middle school I kinda forgot about it and it didn't bother me that I stopped spending my time on pokemon. But now this problem, what I'm about to tell you guys is bothering me. So two years ago I found an anime called Naruto and I was obsessed with it like no other piece of storytelling in the world. I would wake up, think about naruto, and go to bed thinking about naruto. This obsession was way worse than the pokemon obsession. I would run with my hands behind my back yeah that stuff. So now these past 3months, (I'm a freshman in college now), that obsession for naruto has died down and it feels like I forgot why I even got invested in that show in the first place. And it sucks because naruto was special to me like no other anime. Ever since dr stone came out that has been my new obsession. My dr stone obsession is not as bad as the naruto and pokemon obsession, but I like the franchise a lot. I really miss the love i had for naruto though, and I feel guilty for keep switching to anime fandoms. All the anime fans I talk to are dedicated to one anime fandom even though they watch other anime. How do i get that love for naruto back? is this normal for an anime fan to switch to different fandoms? I feel like I don't have a fandom I belong to because I'm obsessed with so many different anime, and the ones I did love they don't interest me as much anymore.",16,1585532493,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frhula/does_this_happen_to_anyone_else_a_love_you_had/,anime,1

    Steins Gate  
    Rurouni Kenshin  
    JoJo's Bizzare Adventure  
    Gintama  
    Samuri Champloo 
    Rising of Shield Hero
    No Game No life

Unifinished (with no intention to finish:)

    Food Wars  
    That Time I was Reincarnated as a Slime  
    Dr. Stone  
    Fairy Tail 
    Kill La Kill

Obviously I like action anime, and that's what I want more of.  I love shows where the main character has some sort of struggle that result in a badass fight scene.  Similar scenes where a characters emotional struggles manifests themselves in some sort of over the top physical powers.  Like the one from HxH (I would spoiler tag it but I can't get it to work, so people who watched it will just have to guess.)

I also enjoy any sort of just epic scene, those are what I want.  The problem is getting those scenes reasonably, or where they aren't ridiculous, that's why fairy tail is in a place of dishonor, big major impactful battle with 0 story.

Recently I have been switching between Gintama, Yu Yu Hakuso, and Jo Jo.  But I find myself unable to keep my interest, sometimes switching in the middle of an episode.  It kinda sucks, because ever since watching HxH I feel as if no other anime is as good.

Animation is wayyyy worse than the previous seasons (i can t stand Soma's eyes) and i also noticed that Erina changed her voice actor. (i liked taneda risa more, she addes the extra layer to Erina voice).

frga2m,Kazuma97,"As a huge Chihayafuru's fan, I was scarred for life from last two episodes especially on episode 23 [Spoilers]","I can't sleep well for days already. It was sad seeing how things turn bitter at the end. Taichi's feeling was not reciprocated. He left the club since the karuta cards seems ""pitch black"" to him. 

And how Chihaya was broken for not realizing Taichi's feeling sooner. She turns from being a happy and cheerful girl to a depressed one. To be fair, it's not on us to judge how she feels. I honestly think, she just confused about her feeling and it's hard to see how she see herself as the ""rock"" that break Taichi's heart. 

It's been a long time since I was so invested into characters. Seeing them in their depressed state makes me feels so bad for them. 

""Chihaya, do you think I'm made up of stone or something""

This small sentence cut deep into Chihaya's heart and made her realize how unfair she was to ask Taichi to stay in the club. She stayed silent and helplessly crying while seeing Taichi turn his back from her.

""I... I was the rock and I.. c-crushed them into pieces. Taichi's feelings... all these years... all that time, I...""

Bless these two poor souls. Fates are sometimes cruel...

Honestly, Chihayafuru is a masterpiece if not for all just in my heart is more than I could ask. Props to Suetsugu Yuki for writing such a beautiful story and Madhouse for outstanding animation. Not to forget both Chihaya's and Taichi's VA for that unforgettable heart wrenching last two episodes. 

It comes to me that Seto Atami crying voice acting is the best I've ever heard out of all anime I've ever watched. My heart feels tight everytime Chihaya cries. One other notable scene is after the tournament that Chihaya won right before the east prelimenary where she said she wants to join the school trip while crying in front of her mom.

I really hope that Taichi and Chihaya could repair their relationship back. I'm not sure what would happen next with Arata at the end gives them a push back into karuta just like how they push Arata back into it when he was in slump after his grandfather's death. 

I'm so excited to see what happens next if Madhouse ever decide to go for fourth season. Hopefully, we don't have to wait for more than two years.",6,1585526512,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frga2m/as_a_huge_chihayafurus_fan_i_was_scarred_for_life/,anime,1

5) Have you seen other super robot shows from this time period? If so, how does this compare? If not, are you interested in giving some of them a try?

6) Were the series‚Äô visuals as bad as you expected? Worse? 

7) Did the series‚Äô body count live up to its reputation? Which character death hit you hardest?

8) Which character was your favorite? Who was your least favorite?

As always, I'll go first. One time, after a long day of school (home schooled), I sat down before dinner to watch some of My Love Story! (Ore Monogatari). While I was still on the intro, my mom walks into the living room (from where you walk in, you can see clearly what the computer shows for the person on the couch), and starts talking about me helping get some chore done or something. She sees I'm watching something, and I, in haste, exit out of fullscreen, letting her accidentally see the name, bright and bold. She looks at me, kneels down, and looking me in the eye, says, ""My Love Story?"" with the most r u srs tone ever. I play it off, and I couldn't bring myself to watch for the rest of the evening.

frcc6o,phiraeth,[Mid-2000s Rewatch] Dennou Coil - Reminder &amp; Interest Thread,"Hey everyone! It's been a few months since Wolf's Rain, but we're back and ready to go for Dennou Coil for the start of April!

If you're new to the Mid-2000s Rewatch series, we have [4 shows planned for this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ed1722/mid2000s_hidden_gems_rewatch_season_2_schedule/): **[Wolf's Rain](https://myanimelist.net/anime/202/Wolfs_Rain), [Terra e...](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2158/Terra_e_TV), [Dennou Coil](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2164/Dennou_Coil/), and [Gankutsuou](https://myanimelist.net/anime/239/Gankutsuou)**. We're watching one show every three months - [Wolf's Rain was January.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/eibbwj/wolfs_rain_rewatch_schedule_24_hour_reminder/)

##What is Dennou Coil?

In the near future, augmented reality has become a key part of daily life. A gentle middle school girl named Yuuko ""Yasako"" Okonogi and her family have just moved to Daikoku City despite rumors of people disappearing. There, her grandmother, nicknamed ""Mega-baa,"" runs a shop called Megasia that specializes in illegal tools which interact with parts of the virtual world.

Mega-baa also hosts an unofficial detective agency called ""Coil,"" a group of children around Yasako's age who find and handle corruption of the virtual world. Yasako gets involved with the group when Fumie Hashimoto, a playful member of Coil, helps rescue her cyberdog Densuke after getting trapped in virtual space while chasing a mysterious virus. Also investigating these corruptions and viruses is an abrasive hacker named Yuuko Amasawa, who the others take to calling Isako.

Can Coil discover the truths behind the mysterious viruses and corruption, and if they can, at what cost?

frbzdu,Calwings,"[WT!] Powerpuff Girls Z - ""A pinch of magic to go with that sugar and spice.""","Let‚Äôs face it: almost any kid who grew up in the 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs remembers The Powerpuff Girls. Airing on American television from 1998 to 2005, the adventures of [these three pint-sized superheroes](https://i.imgur.com/s2AOiOK.jpg) saving the world before bedtime was one of the most famous western cartoons of its era. It even crossed into the view of anime fans when it aired as part of Cartoon Network‚Äôs Toonami block alongside anime giants like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon. The cartoon was also rebooted in 2016 and‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ [it‚Äôs best that we forget that ever happened](https://i.imgur.com/rEnPgGz.jpg). However, in between the glory days of the original cartoon and the unmitigated disaster of the reboot, the girls made one more stop in Japan. Toei Animation, the same studio that created the aforementioned Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon, wanted to create an anime version of the beloved western cartoon, and [Powerpuff Girls Z](https://i.imgur.com/FOLSA8e.jpg) was born. But did it have the sugar, spice, and everything nice it needed to be an enjoyable anime worth watching? I think it did.

# What exactly is Powerpuff Girls Z?

As I mentioned above, [Powerpuff Girls Z](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1221/Demashita_Powerpuff_Girls_Z) (abbreviated to PPGZ for the rest of this write-up) is an anime series created by Toei Animation that aired on Japanese TV starting in July 2006, running for 52 episodes in total. The anime would also receive an English dub from Ocean Productions, but oddly, this dub was never broadcast on American television, only in Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

Unlike the original PPG cartoon, which was grounded in western superhero tropes, PPGZ instead borrowed a lot of its designs and aesthetics from magical girl anime like Sailor Moon and Toei‚Äôs other addition to the genre that came out around the same time, Pretty Cure. The anime revolves around three normal schoolgirls, Momoko, Miyako, and Kaoru, who are one day struck with strange white Z-Rays and gain the ability to transform into magical warriors. Together with Professor Utonium and his son (who were accidentally responsible for the Z-Rays being spread out in the first place) Blossom with her yoyos, Bubbles with her bubble wand, and Buttercup with her hammer fight to protect the world against all sorts of evil monsters created by exposure to black Z-Rays.

**Note:** in the English dub, the Japanese names mentioned above are not used, and they‚Äôre simply referred to as Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup all the time as if those are their real names.  Since those names are what the vast majority of people know them as, that's what I'll refer to them as for the rest of this write-up.

Besides the bizarre setup of how the girls and the enemies they fight got their powers, the show mostly follows the standards for magical girl anime in the pre-Madoka era: ‚Äúmonster of the week‚Äù fights plus some recurring villains, a final boss pulling the strings and waiting at the end of the series, girls running and jumping around in [precariously short skirts](https://i.imgur.com/cBrxvtG.gif), and some [surprisingly suggestive transformation sequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ur7WOayoRk) that I'm *shocked* weren't censored at all in the English broacast. The art style is pretty standard for the time, with the main trio‚Äôs slightly larger eyes making them stand out and acting as a throwback to their wide-eyed designs in the original cartoon. The voice acting in the Japanese version (including a young Emiri Kato as Blossom and Ryusei Nakao, AKA the voice of Frieza, as Him) is very good, while the English dub is weaker but still good in its own right. [The animation is solid too](https://i.imgur.com/hvqZG6h.gif), but like most magical girl anime, you‚Äôll probably find yourself skipping over stock footage quite a bit. There are a couple of standout fights in terms of action, but most of them are only good and not really great.

# So if you're say it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly good and not really great‚Äù, then why should I waste my time with it?

Despite all of the comparisons I‚Äôve mentioned above and the ‚Äúgood but not great‚Äù vibes I‚Äôve been giving off so far, I do believe that PPGZ has its own merits that make it worth watching. By combining elements of *both* western cartoons and Japanese magical girl anime into a unique blend of both styles, PPGZ carves out its own niche of being a much more comedy-focused magical girl anime than its contemporaries.

Sailor Moon and Precure have funny moments or funny episodes here and there, but PPGZ is treated as a comedy almost 100% of the time. Blossom‚Äôs bombastic spirit, Bubbles‚Äô airheaded cuteness, and Buttercup‚Äôs tomboyish coolness all play off each other really well in many different situations. Whether it‚Äôs Blossom and Bubbles discussing something girly and Buttercup being disgusted, Buttercup and Blossom talking about sports or athletics while Bubbles is confused, or Bubbles and Buttercup poking fun at Blossom‚Äôs love of superhero comics despite them being heroes themselves, the three are constantly taking playful jabs at each other and their interactions are always fun. The [various returning villains](https://i.imgur.com/I3ij3lV.gif) from the original cartoon also fit well into this comedic style while still looking good in their new more anime-ish designs. From [the resident butt monkey](https://i.imgur.com/bRg3ut5.gif) (pun definitely intended) Mojo Jojo being blasted into oblivion every few episodes, to the cynical snark and sarcasm of the series‚Äô most dastardly villain, Him, they all manage to have some funny and entertaining moments of their own.

Overall, PPGZ‚Äôs main defining feature is how fun, humorous, and lighthearted it is. Despite the anime art style and magical girl aesthetic, it still feels like a western cartoon at heart, and it‚Äôs not ashamed of that at all. If you have fond memories of the original cartoon and want to see a little twist on it, or if you like magical girl anime in general but want to watch something more lighthearted as a break from this dark post-Madoka era, or even if you're just bored and feel like laughing to forget about the troubles of the world, give Powerpuff Girls Z a shot. The show may be far from perfect, but you might be pleasantly surprised at [how much fun you have](https://i.imgur.com/6GmG3Qy.gif) watching it.",4,1585511341,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frbzdu/wt_powerpuff_girls_z_a_pinch_of_magic_to_go_with/,anime,5

frbkl3,Tungerman,[WT!] Taisho Baseball Girls - Cute girls doing baseball things... 100 years ago,"**Links:** [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5141/Taishou_Yakyuu_Musume), [AniList](https://anilist.co/anime/5141/Taishou-Yakyuu-Musume), [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io/anime/taishou-yakyuu-musume), [AniDB](https://anidb.net/anime/6315), [Anime News Network](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10206), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taish%C5%8D_Baseball_Girls)

**Streaming:** [HIDIVE](https://www.hidive.com/stream/taisho-baseball-girls/s01e001), [VRV](https://vrv.co/series/G6XJ32Z8R/Taisho-Baseball-Girls)

**Original title:** Â§ßÊ≠£ÈáéÁêÉÂ®ò (Taishou Yakyuu Musume)

**Aired:** Summer 2009

**Genres:** Sports, Slice of Life, Comedy, Historical

**Length:** 24 min x 12 episodes

##Premise:
1920s Japan. Baseball is still a new sport brought over from overseas. The story follows a couple of young girls as they try to overcome gender norms and form an all-female baseball team that could rival the boys.

##What is the Series Like?

At its core Taisho Baseball Girls is just a Cute Girls Doing Cute Things show with a bit of flavoring. It's a sports-themed slice of life with very little drama (and even when there is any, it's extremely mild). This is the kind of light-hearted show you watch to unwind and take your mind off everyday struggles.

There's a bunch of cute girls that you'll want to cheer for as they do their best to improve and succeed. The people around them aren't always supportive of their endeavors, yet there aren't any particularly unpleasant characters, and good spirits are maintained throughout the entire show.

The show is often episodic, with many episodes following their own mini-plotlines. The general plot, however, is a pretty standard A-to-B sports success story ‚Äî starting with the main characters not even knowing the basic rules of baseball, and ending with them becoming pretty good at the game.

##Why You Should Watch It

Taisho Baseball Girls is a chill anime that you watch when you just want to have a good time. You'll probably like it if you enjoyed series like K-On!, Yuru Camp, Lucky Star, Hidamari Sketch, and so on. However, there are a few things that makes it stand out among other slice-of-life or CGDCT anime:

* It has a cool, unique aesthetic. There's a lot of detail put into creating the atmosphere of early 20th century Japan, and it really adds a special flavor to the show. The soundtrack has an oldschool romantic/neoclassical style to it with occasional touches of traditional Japanese music, and is in my opinion one of the most underrated anime scores out there ([link to the full OST if you want to take a listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6C6Yca9O3I)). There aren't many anime with this kind of setting, and most of them fall under genres like historical drama, war, thriller, action, adventure, etc., so a cute little show like this is really nice to have around.   
*Similar anime: GochiUsa, Konohana Kitan, From Up on Poppy Hill.*

* It's not overly sugary, in-your-face kind of cute. Everything is just naturally cute and funny, without being overwhelmingly ""moe"" ‚Äî perfect if you want to take a break from all the diabetes-inducing shows and have something more relaxed. There's also a notable lack of fanservice, though there are some yuri undertones.   
*Similar anime: Flying Witch, Bamboo Blade.*

* It's a slice-of-life with a decent amount of action. If you're tired of slice-of-life anime where it's just a bunch of modern day high schoolers going about their boring everyday activities, then this show might be a nice change of pace for you. There is actual progression (i.e. the girls getting better at baseball), as well as fun smaller storylines within each episode. The show doesn't get overly wild at any point, but you'll also never get bored from the lack of things happening on the screen.   
 *Similar anime: Little Witch Academia (1st half), A Place Further Than the Universe.*

* Feminist themes. The show handles them in a very subtle, laid-back manner. Strong female characters, as well as discussions of topics like gender roles are not something you see a lot in anime in general, so if that's something that interests you then you might want to give this show a try.   
 *Similar anime: Hourou Musuko.*

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, every series has its downsides, and this one is no exception. And while I don't have a whole lot of bad things to say about this show, I do have to mention that

## You May Not Like It If

* You don't like slice-of-life and/or Cute Girls Doing Cute Things anime.

* You want either a super funny comedy or a super cute CGDCT. This show does get silly at times, but in general its comedy and moe elements are fairly lowkey.

* You prefer anime with vibrant and memorable characters. The characters aren't this show's strong point. It has a pretty big cast, and aside from the 2 main girls, most of the main characters don't get much development or spotlight throughout the show's short 12-episode runtime.

* You're looking for a realistic historical anime. While this show is listed as ""historical"" and is set during the Taisho era, it's not very historically accurate and some elements can feel out of place for its time period. That said, if you're not familiar with the Taisho era or 20th century history, chances are you won't notice too many inaccuracies anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

One last thing ‚Äî this series is very obscure, currently sitting at just over 15,000 members on MyAnimeList, which is ridiculously low for an anime from the late 2000s. It's also incredibly hard to find content or discussion for it on the Internet. If you are like me and love discovering hidden gems, definitely consider adding this show to your list!

#TL;DR

frb4nt,MetaThPr4h,"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [March 29th, 2020]","Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2020 season (like **Haikyuu!! TO THE TOP** and **Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Boku no Hero Academia S4** and **Diamond no Ace Act II**).

With regards to Fall 2019 shows, or series that already finished airing from this season, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **Dr. Stone**, **Kono Oto Tomare! 2nd Season**, **Mairimashita! Iruma-kun** or **Darwin's Game** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

Left is TV version in JP, right is the version some web broadcasters received. Fun fact, the unfinished version has actually some better animations on some parts, meaning the TV version might not be the final version as well.

frah4z,thebroadway,Anime side characters as examples of intense focus/dedication to a singular goal of being the best at something. My best example right now is Netero from Hunter x Hunter. I especially believe his dedication is told in a very beautiful way,"Hello all, first time posting here. What I'm searching for is mostly in the title, but the example doesn't have to be from an anime focused on combat. To be even more specific, I'm looking for someone who achieved their goal (Netero, for example, does seem to have become the most powerful or at least tied for it), and I would like their story told in more of a short amount of time (Netero's tale of his rise to power is told in, what, five episodes?). I also specifically like how Netero not once complains or even thinks to do anything other than training as that is his heart/love/life; there is nothing else for him. I know that Saitama is a main character, but he would be a bad example because while he does become the best, he complains quite a bit (I understand why) and his story is the entire anime, so not short (though I will gratefully take any example you give and look into it). While Genos's story is long and he hasn't yet achieved his goal, he's a better, though not perfect, example in that he has a truly singular focus and never really complains (though I'd prefer them hitting all marks, again). I hope that helps a bit. Basically, I'm looking for some motivation for things I'm doing right now :). If it's a story that's told in a short span of time (an anime with only a single season or a movie), I am willing to accept main characters (thought of that just now).

Couldn't find this by searching, I may have looked it up incorrectly. Again, I will gladly accept any example/link, I'm just thankful for your time.

fra8er,Gattsu2000,"I Just Saw ""Bloom Into You"" (2018) And It Affected Me Deeply...","I love this... I love this so much. Wow. I was not expecting to get this experience from it. Before watching this anime, I was imagining I would a typical yuri anime that was adorable for the sake of being adorable but this anime proved itself to be a lot more than that.

Both of the main characters in this story, Yuu and Nanami, are lovable as characters. Something that really catched me by surprise is just how the characters behave as people. I thought the younger girl in the relationship was gonna act all shy and hesitant but she's surprisingly mature as a character and filled with self-awareness about her conflicted feelings for this girl and how she needs to handle their connection. The older struggles to keep strong front for the crowd and living up to the image of her sister so she needs Yuu in order to relieve herself from the pressure of her position as the president student. And I can really relate to their relationship despite not being a woman myself or a lesbian. I always believed I had to create a false persona in front of others at school because I saw my own self as weak and not having any particular talent. I always looked up to someone or something as a way of establishing my identity. And I did once in my life had a person who helped me kiss those wounds away from my soul. She helped me express a part of myself that I wouldn't show to anyone. All of my secrets would be revealed to her to just her and not anyone else. But also, I had this unhealthy condition of indulging too much of myself to her and never coming to accept myself but rather, I let someone accept me in order to feel better about who I am. But also, something was separating us from getting closer and that made me grieve for her affection because without it, I felt lost and I wouldn't be able to be myself again with anyone And the way how this show expresses that is beautiful.

Both characters have a lot of chemistry and is very tense in nature. Not because you want them to become a couple like so many anime do (Which becomes annoying and is a cheap tease) but rather, because you want them to hold on to that relationship. You feel that frustration and desire of the characters wanting to express themselves more but not able to because of fear that taking it to a higher level might ruin the nice connection that they now have and then you feel very happy and liberated once they release their love and care for each other. I just love their interactions for each other. It's funny, emotional and adorable to watch. They feel like people and you just want them to work things out. This anime showed me the kind of relationship I really wanted to see in ""Portrait Of A Lady On Fire"" and ""Your Name"", which for me had failed me to deliver this care and love I should've had for both of these characters. One that actually gave you a reason for why you should care for both of these characters to stay together and one where you actually fall in love for each of the individuals deciding to become into one.

And besides this being a beautiful romance, this is a powerful story about identity and coming to accept yourself as a person rather than simply letting someone else love for you. But also, this is a story that shows that someone, we need that special someone to be there to help us because somewhere out there, someone cares for you and you shouldn't close in. Embrace your emotions. Embrace your love. Embrace empathy. No apathy.

And last thing I would say about this anime is that it looks visually beautiful and helps making the experience and emotions get more powerful than they already are but even without that good quality, the writing, romance and characters are so amazingly done that it does not matter and you just want to see it like that all the way through. There was no single second where it felt tedious or stale. I always wanting to see for where things were gonna go. I wanted it to stay as good as it was doing and it did. I am so happy I saw this anime. This might possibly be my favorite anime couple of all time and a great representation for the LBGTQ. And arguably, the best romance ever written.

So yeah, beautiful anime and one of the best ones I've ever seen. My entire self is only filled with love for this anime and I think it's just perfect for what it is. Thank you for whoever wrote this. I thank you... üíûüíïüíóüíñ

fr9cqn,CosmicPenguin_OV103,What are your bold predictions for Spring 2020's anime?,"Since the season is about to start very soon, and I haven't seen *bold predictions* in the earlier threads just yet, here's my own predictions:  


* After suffering from delays which pushed climax scenes into Spring, Railgun T will be AOTS with some absolute shocking actions scenes fast approaching. Maybe the team will be able to get the main animator responsible for Demon Slayer Episode 19 - who worked as one of the key staff on Railgun S1 a decade ago - back for these key moments.
* Tower of God will be the biggest flop in r/anime history since Darling in the FranXX 2 years ago - in fact as far as I know unlike here where some many people hyped for this, popularity for the ToG anime in Japan and where I live in (which has a huge anime enthusiasts crowd) is essentially non-existent, despite Webtoons comics having slight popularity in both places. From what I have seen about people talking about the original source elsewhere I'm also not so sure that the source material is *that* good. Maybe I'm seeing the wrong things, but the hype seems to be only happening in here, MAL and maybe back in Korea.
* Despite missing from the anime world for 5 years (vs 1 for Kaguya-sama), Oregairu S3 will be back with even more hype than currently seems and a huge fight on karma will occur here soon. Kaguya vs Yukino &amp; Chika/Miko vs Yui/Iroha/etc. will also be a highlight for the Spring season. Both will end up worth the hype BTW.
* BNA will be TRIGGER's best TV anime since Kill la Kill so many years ago - I have seen reports from those who already watched the first few episodes that it's very good.
* Appare-Ranman! will be pretty good (as supported by preview screening on selected sites globally for the 1st 2 episodes), but as with PA Works' original shows it will be under-watched, JOJO Part 7 jokes not withstanding.
* Listeners will fall in the same way as Mekakucity Actors did several years ago (both are music-originated shows), probably not as much, but will still be a disappointment.
* Sword Art Online's current final part will continue to be as polarizing as it has been since 2012, though the animations will be worth the watch for those still following the series.
* Fruits Basket and Bookworm's 2nd part will be as good as their first parts - but won't win the popularity part.
* If BOFURI's controversy is loud enough to make you feel like to argue, Bakarina will be much worse and will be as controversial as Shield Hero did last year. I will stay away from the fights though as I've zero interest in this one.
* *The 8th Son* will be as bad as *Arifureta* did last year.....but somehow gets a 2nd season after this.
* *Gleipnir* will be forgotten within the first few episodes.
* *Kakushigoto* will be a sleeper hit for this season despite this not ended up with SHAFT as many predicted. The original source is apparently very interesting and lead me to pick it up over many other titles next season.
* *Sing Yesterday for You, Wave, Listen to Me!* and *Arte* will be 3 fairly to very well done SOL shows that will attract some watchers here, but possibly not that good enough to capture high popularity. I have considered all 3 of them to follow through next season but had to drop them because I have a huge queue of older shows waiting for me to watch them.
* No CGDCT shows for next season (*Tamayomi*, *After-school Fishing Diary, Princess Connect* etc.) will be popular enough here, but they will attract a niche of those desperately looking for the seasonal cute girls shows dessert.
* No game-adaption shows will be popular here - certainly not the likes of *Shironeko* or *New Sakura Wars*, both AFAIK big game IPs in the Far East but seems to be completely unknown here.
* And here's some sad predictions under the current world situation, but it looks like Japan might be in some danger of having to lock-down for coronovirus soon. Maybe not quite as people there are more proactive in preventive measures than in the West (widespread masks wearing since early February, schools closed and events cancelled since late February etc.), but people are still going out for work and other things and the government seems somewhat problematic in testing and other measures. I'll give a 30-40% chance that Tokyo will have to lock-down for 1-2 weeks in this season, which would mean that all anime will probably suffer from delays of this magnitude or even greater. Maybe even a 5-10% chance that a month long or even longer lock-down. Many anime might have to air a la Madoka did - last episodes not appearing until deep into the summer season, possibly airing 2 or more episodes at once in special airing slots. Also I'm giving about a 30% chance that F/HF III will be delayed again, as with the Violet Evergarden Movie and maybe even Evangelion 3.0+1.0. Effects on animation qualities are beyond my ability to predict (as with everything about this pandemic - I was guessing that most western countries will be able to resume most activities by late April - early May but I'm not sure that can really happen).",162,1585502147,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fr9cqn/what_are_your_bold_predictions_for_spring_2020s/,anime,1

fr8slr,TheTinyTopHat,The main characters from Keep your Hands off Eizouken are direct descendants of the main characters from Kill La Kill,"Let me explain.

Yes this is a theory so take it with a salt grain.

Spoilers!


1. Ryuuko - Mizusaki

Mizuaki comes from a family of actors. She's wealthy and lives in a nice big house. From what we see of Ryuuko however she isn't wealthy nor does she appear to have access to wealth. That being said what would Ryuuko do after she was done saving the world? Why acting? It's actually a perfect fit for her. Now that she can't just run around and slice up bad guys she needs a job that requires that skill of projecting her voice and maneuvering her body. Acting is the perfect choice for her as she can do both with ease. There she would meet her husband and have a family. Sometime down the line Mizusaki would come along. Now Ryuuko knows all about being constrained and stuck. Due to this it would make sense that she would allow her children to run free. To not be constrained by their family. This is why Mizusaki isn't constantly supervised nor demanded to do much else besides not making anime but even that is rescinded at a point. 

2. Mako - Asakusa 

The physical similarities play a bigger part here than with Ryuuko. Both have shorter hair and round heads. They also share energetic personalities and usually only focus on one thing at a time. Mako would eventually grow up and have a family of her own. Since Mako has learned the hard way that game and fortune lead to disaster she prefers a simpler life with her family. Thus Asakusa lives in a simple home. That being said her life lessons are ones that Asakusa takes to heart. To follow your dreams no matter what and to not lose your way. As Mako grows older she loses most of her high energy demeanor but Asakusa continues to hold onto that legacy. 

3. Satsuki - Konomari

Perhaps the most direct of the three both Satsuki and Konomari have more in common that the previous two. Physically and personally. Satsuki would stray from the spotlight after the world was saved as well. Looking for a more peaceful life she would step down as a company leader and finally have a family. However she wouldn't forget what shes learned. Enter Konomari. Satsuki's regal demeanor would have Konomari grow up in a disciplined household. Hence her logical side and no nonsense personality. She gets things done because her family is known for it. As for her mind for business that was cultivated by Satsuki. Being the heir to the largest clothing company in the world she would know a bit about how to run a company. Knowledge passed down to Konomari who has a keen eye for business and money. The third descendant.

Dont take this seriously. It's a joke that went to far tbh. However it's not a terrible theory and maybe it'll be validated when in the second season of Eizouken the primordial life fiber returns and they have to animate another Kamui to fight it.

This series went a million miles an hour from the start and I loved it. Watching Lelouch mold himself into the phrase ‚Äúyou‚Äôve activated my trap card‚Äù from yugioh was fun as hell. Even with asspulls here and there my mind was blown. 

Each cliffhanger was amazing and I enjoyed how nothing would deny him his end goal. He is one inspiring noodle boy.

Euphie getting a tactical nuke in about 3 seconds when Lelouch accidentally geassed her broke me. I love it because of that. It was so horrible and made such an impact. Bloodstained Eupihe &gt;Red wedding 

I think I flipped on Rolo 3 different times. Wanted him dead after Shirley but in the end I felt so sad for him as all he wanted was love and a family. 

The two 1-800-TITTIES scenes in S1 caught me off guard hard but i am not complaining. I‚Äôm in love with Kallen. And envious of suzaku on the island. 

I always hated how suzaku fought for Brittania for so long but expected the Lelouch team up in the end and appreciated that he still had faith in Lelouch to go through with it.

After s2 episode 21 I was like Lelouch WTF are you doing, I started to dislike him for being the crazy tyrannical ruler and he just played me like the fiddle I was. 

The ending I should‚Äôve seen coming but it blew me away and i still am destroyed from it. the second I realized that Lelouch meant for himself to be killed all along to channel the hate unto only him so that the world can forever have peace.....it broke me. I‚Äôm gonna miss you Lelouch. You crazy SOB. 

Also season 2 should be called Code ASS

All in all I can‚Äôt recommend  it more. I‚Äôll never forget my time watching this. I hope to get emotionally invested in another show but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to. This was so special.

fr86fd,H1rose,The Saddest Anime,"I have watched 4 anime shows/movies these past few days, and they're all pretty good, but which of them is the best? (Also please recommend more)

The shows that I've watched are, Your Name, A Silent Voice, I Want To Eat Your Pancreas, and Your Lie In April. 

These are my thoughts on each of them. (SPOILERS)

1) Your Name - Your Name's plot is confusing, it is also incredible. The characters were great, and the animation was beautiful. The ending was bitter-sweet, even though they are most likely gonna end up together, they forgot about their memories. Also for some reason it didn't make me cry.

2) A Silent Voice - Honestly this show is amazing, the plot was good, the characters were also great, and the message it conveys is truly beautiful. The ending was satisfying with mc finally opening his ears and eyes, everyone just getting along, the ending made me cry.

3) I Want To Eat Your Pancreas - The reason I watched this is because of the weird title, and I don't regret watching it.  The plot is good, characters were weird (in a good way), animation was beautiful as well. Even though in the start of the show we already got spoiled of what happened to the girl, somehow I was still shocked because of the twist. The part where the guy asked if he could cry, that part just ripped my heart off and couldn't hold back the tears. The ending was also pretty good, the guy and the girl's bestfriend got along, he became a better person, and became friends with gum guy.

4) Your Lie In April - At first I though this show was hella cheesy but no. The thing that probably ruined/saved this show for me is the fact that I got spoiled on Kaori's death. The plot was good, characters were good, animation was stunning, and the music is amazing. Let's get back to the spoiled thing. The ending didn't hit me as hard because I knew she was gonna die but for some reason it still made me cry, honestly I still am haunted by this show. I guess the spoiler also kind of saved me because if it did hit me hard, I probably would be a wreck by now. The ending was kind of unsatisfying, lack of information about what happened. Like who won the contest, what happened to the characters. It just felt like it was lacking something, still it is a good show.

fr85ul,KinkyWinkyDA,Seven Deadly Sins *season 2 spoiler*,"I was just wondering if anyone knew how long Guila was hypnotized for? I don't mind mind control and hypnosis as a general theme but I HATE it when the media it's in doesn't give us a time frame or to what level it was. That said, how long was Guila hypnotized for and to what severity? (Was she completely gone or was her subconcious imprisoned at the back of her mind?)


That said, I really don't like Gowther as a character, I may even say I hate him. I get he was essentially a puppet but I don't think he was controlled to do that and I think he did it of jis pwn volition as stated by him wanting to understand love. For a protagonist we're supposed to like he sure did a pretty terrible thing and overall is a terrible being and character. I hope he is killed and stays dead forever if I'm being honest, I mean, he's not really important to the story moving forward for however many seasons in the anime or chapters in the manga, if he was gone and never returned there wouldn't be anything missing and both mediums would be more enjoyable. That is my opinion anyway, no hate to people who like him regardless of reason.",2,1585497896,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fr85ul/seven_deadly_sins_season_2_spoiler/,anime,1

fr838x,Dillon_Trinh,Gegege no Kitaro 2018 review,"Since episode 97 was release yesterday and it was the final episode of this anime, this review will be more of pros and cons(little bit of spoilers).

Pros:

\-The anime story in each episode is really good, and it shows the life and struggles of each yokai and human characters.

\-Kitaro calm attitude what makes me like this anime really a lot, even though the anime it did change kitaro a lot to make him fit with the modern people, his calm attitude and really badass fighting skill are still the same like the older series.

\-I really like the modern look of this anime, the designs of them make them sleek and streamline  it really make them look like a badass.

\-I like that they put the dark secret of social media, it makes the anime enjoyable to watch.

\-Adding Mana is one of the best choice this anime, it was the second anime in this to have a human ally to be with kitaro( the first being **Yumeko Tend≈ç** if you watch the 1985 anime), she's my favorite female characters in this anime. My favorite moment of her from this anime, is where she sacrifice her memories to help kitaro to defeat backbeard, I really like Mana, and who knows, she might come back for a feature film.

Cons:

\-The only con i'll put in this anime is the fanservice, this anime and the series is never meant to be a fanservice anime, making Neko Musume a little tsundere did kind of annoy me and there's some cringe moments, like when kitaro was playing a dating simulator(it was funny, but it was a little bit cringy), I guess they're trying to make it fit with the modern people, which I don't blame theme.

\-This's more like a biased opinion, but this anime is known for going over 100 episodes(the 1985, 1996, and 2007 anime went at 100 and over) I was really surprised that they end it, i'm pretty sure they have a good reason to end this anime. I really wish they could do more episodes, with more great stories, but we can't have all nice things.

So all in all, this anime and its 2 year run really put a special place in my heart, its one of those anime's where it has a older cult following and please the fans, the anime has a bittersweet ending, and we might not see Mana and the newer characters in this anime(unless we get a feature film), and in 10 years or more we might have another new Gegege no Kitaro anime series with news characters and designs, and I really enjoy this anime.

fr7wpd,difficult_smile,"Con somebody explain me something about the title of Oregairu? Mainly, why they went for this short title? More details inside.","This is a super stupid and trivial question, but it's bugging me for a long time XD

As you know anime often have long titles, which are shortened in more catchy titles.

Now, I speak Japanese.

I've seen online the title „ÇÑ„ÅØ„Çä‰ø∫„ÅÆÈùíÊò•„É©„Éñ„Ç≥„É°„ÅØ„Åæ„Å°„Åå„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã (yahari ore no seishun rabucome ha machigattieru), which can be translated as

&gt;I knew it, there is something wrong with the rom-com that is my youth.

A *long* title that express very well what is about the story.

But then it's shortened in ‰ø∫„Åå„ÅÑ„Çã (oregairu) which can be translated in:

&gt;I'm here.

Now this perplexes me, because, in Japanese, it can be both read as:

* I'm here [for you].

* [Hey, can't you see] I'm here.

In other words, one take makes you think it's a story about a person who is able to be close to the ones he cares about, and sustain them in need. The other take makes it feel like he's is rather ignored by a character or many characters, and he fights for being aknwoledged. 

Now, my question is simple: which of these takes is closer to the story?

I've never seen even a trailer of that anime, so I can't guess.",47,1585496942,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fr7wpd/con_somebody_explain_me_something_about_the_title/,anime,1

fr48gy,jwaiwaiwai,"Fireworks ""Uchiage Hanabi"" ending which makes sense","Note: Everything is IMO and just wanna share it because i think that this is all quite accurate.

First, this movie consist of only one timeline, not multiple timelines. Then you would be asking what is all that Norimichi have been through. In fact, what i think those are possibilities happening in his subconscious mind. Norimichi can experience in person those three possibilities because he is the one who threw the ball. The ball enables you to really experience things unlike the normal human where we wish for something but we cannot experience it, which is call imagining as well.

To figure out everything of what this movie is trying to tell, we must focus on even the tiniest detail in this movie. 

1)The rotation of the wind turbine

The wind turbine that is spinning clockwise indicates the only original timeline, while you can see that  in those posibilities where they show the turbine, the turbine moves counterclockwise. 

2)The lighthouse (IMPORTANT)

Think of the possibility as a server. Keep in mind that the person who threw the ball will be automatically connected to the server. Which means that initially, Norimichi was all alone in the possibility and those that showed up in the possibility is just his imagination. And then there is the lighthouse light/blinking which actually indicates whoever that saw the light/blinking is connected to the possibility. Example in the movie is where in the second possibility where Norimichi holds onto Nazuna's hand and jumped off the train station, Norimichi can see the lighthouse blinking because he is the person who threw the ball in the first place. Next, Nazuna also saw the lighthouse blinking which means that Nazuna's subconscious mind has connected to the possibility at that point. This can be explained where in the end, Nazuna believes that she can forge a way with Norimichi in the future because she is present in the possibility. It wasn't those who threw the ball can be connected to the possibility but other people outside can connect to it like telepathy. In the third possibility, Norimichi told Nazuna about what he has been going through repeating the same day (like actually losing the swimming match, Nazuna inviting the winners to watch fireworks,etc.) but Nazuna doesn't understand what he is talking about. This shows that Nazuna's subconscious isn't always present in the possibility but at certain times only (somehow connected at all the times where she believe that she and Norimichi can be together).

The lighthouse has a close relationship with the ball. As you can see that when the old man at the beach side mistakenly shoot the ball, thinking it was a firework, the ball did not explode due to being blasted, but it was in contact with the light from the lighthouse which caused it to explode. In the first and second possibility, we see that Norimichi threw the ball but it did not break. 

Besides, the lighthouse factor was also shown when Nazuna talked about her dad.  There is the scene where Nazuna's dad was carrying her when she was small and at that time, it shows the lighthouse giving a signal and Nazuna's dad saw the light from the lighthouse too (Nazuna's dad has the ball in his hands before). However, Nazuna said that her dad and mom divorced when she was in the womb. Nazuna's mom told her that her father disappeared but in actual fact, her dad was dead in the sea holding the ball. The reason why Nazuna's dad is dead due to the excessive usage of the ball. We can see that when Norimichi was using it for the third time, he appears on the train really shocked (the look in his eyes). This shows that the ball actually takes a toll on the user's psychology. Norimichi used the ball thrice and he is starting to lose his mind. So imagine Nazuna's dad who actually threw the ball lots of times causes him to be lost in his possibilities and his mind cannot take it, which eventually forces him to suicide so that his mind can rest.

3)The last possibility

It is where Norimichi wishes that Nazuna's parents can't find her and his friends can't find him as well. So eventually they ended up in a sphere, which is in his own world. The reason they ended up in a sphere is because the ball cannot fulfill Norimichi's request of being possible to hide from everyone and staying with Nazuna only. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. So the train actually take them to a virtual place rather to a real place which exists in the real world. The last possibility can be said as an imagination  but Norimichi's and Nazuna's subconscious mind is connected to it. (KEEP IN MIND THAT THE FIRST TWO POSSIBILITIES IS REAL AND WILL HAPPEN IF HE TOOK THE SAME ACTIONS AND ALSO MOST IMPORTANTLY WIN THE SWIMMING RACE FIRST. ) We can see that eventually Nazuna swam away from Norimichi which means her subconscious mind is disconnected from the imagination.

4)Nazuna in the train

When Nazuna sings in the train, she suddenly appeared inside a mystical place. In the end of that scene, her subconscious connects to that possibility and she experiences that if she ran away from home, she will be in real trouble and eventually in that scene, she said to herself that she has to return to her family and she really wants to spend and appreciate that one day with Norimichi. In the end, she really left with her parents, which shows that she is connected to the possibility. 

5)Fireworks

As we all know, fireworks are round. Those fireworks that appear flat or weird does not mean a fake timeline, but it shows different possibilities. It is not an indicator of fake or true, but it wants to portray different possibilities. Otherwise, how would they show the viewers what is happening and if they don't show, no one will understand what is going on (which time is which time).

Conclusion

In the end, Nazuna really left with her parents because she told herself it was wrong running away from home (in the possibility). The three possibilities did not happen but what Norimichi's subconscious mind experience is REAL. The actual movie starts back to the point where he threw the ball. Due to his subconscious mind experiencing those effects, his mind tells him that he can actually live with Nazuna in the future and even though he lost the swimming race which caused all the possibilities to not happen, he can start from the point where he threw the ball and carry out actions that bring him closer to Nazuna (find her, move to the same place with her, etc.). Therefore, in the last scene where the teacher calls his name, he is not present because he forge his own way to be able to live with Nazuna in the future. Nazuna's name was not called as she has already sent the letter to her teacher. In that case, it is said that the ball actually gives a lot of hope to the person that threw it so that they can just chance on whatever they think can help them achieve their goals. THIS MOVIE ADVICES US TO TAKE A CHANCE EVEN THOUGH YOU FEEL THAT IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE, OTHERWISE YOU WILL JUST BE THE PERSON THAT NORIMICHI'S FRIEND WAS, WHICH IS TOO SCARED OF SOMETHING AND AVOID IT FOR HIS WHOLE LIFE. (Norimichi's friend actually love Nazuna too)

Those that threw the ball will eventually return to the one original timeline. They will not be lost in the space within the ball.",0,1585479817,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fr48gy/fireworks_uchiage_hanabi_ending_which_makes_sense/,anime,1

fr2h8u,Gamesareunderratedt,Anime plot similar to Vampite Knight and Romeo X Juliet?,"MC= main character RI= Romantic interest

I am looking for an anime where either 

a) MC and RI know they are enemies from the start but love each other anyway but cannot defy the fact that they are enemies. 
I don't mind 2 endings (1 MC and RI have to remain enemies or 2 MC and RI get together. I prefer 1)

b) MC and RI don't know they are enemies until the end. I don't mind the 2 endings (1 MC and RI have to stay enemies or 2 they get together.) I STRONGLY prefer 1.


I loved Vampire knight due to the budding romance between Mc and RI up until MC bro woke her powers up and RI told her if he saw her again he'd kill her because he hates vampires. &lt;This is the type of ending I want in both sceneros. 

MC and RI recognize their love but in the end choose the family/traditions/etc and remain enemies. 


Is there any other anime like this?

The anime had a really powerful MC who hid his power. When he was a kid he defeated a toad demon over noodles, when an elite group were struggling against it. 

Several years later, he is entering an academy, and part of the admission test is to defeat a projection of this same toad, which, conveniently, is sealed under the school. The main character defeats the toad, making a new record for the test.

The toad is terrified when it remembers the kid, and some other stuff happens, and the main character summons the toad as his familiar while in class and mixes it with a dog.

fqzuja,Gikame,I need help,"So, as the title itself is rather unspecific I will now as I caught your attention explain the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a very specific anime which I sadly only know very few details of. For one I only watched the first episode. For the other, I watched it like 1-2 years ago, maybe even three, I dont have a good sense of time but it certainly wasnt any longer ago.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I remember, the anime was based in the real world and around the main male protagonist. I dont remember too much about him but the thing that had got me hooked which was the introduction of a female, almost villain like, character that attacked him. She wore a full on armorerd dress with a high neckcover, had long white (unsure, could be grey-ish) hair which i think was covered by some sort of cap, was able to levitate and had magical abilities, one of which (if I remember correctly) would let her control and summon knife or other sharp objects. The picture that I still have in my head is her floating in midair, with a circle of ""knifes"" floating around her.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, as I am trying to remember it, the anime very much felt like a reverse Isekai. Especially as I think to remember that the girl I mentioned above, was tied to the death of a character the protagonist knew in the real world.

&amp;#x200B;

If no one here knows the answer then... welll... I honestly dont know :/

Thank you either way!",5,1585456192,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqzuja/i_need_help/,anime,1

so I kinda forgot what anime I just started thinking about, so if anyone has any idea what I'm about to write please tell me, the struggle is real...

I remember only the end of it, at least I hope it was the end... Think it's a mystery anime where some guy is trying to figure out a case, it leads him to a abandoned building somewhere far away in a snowy place, where the main antagonist is. Think he was trying to get some item the antagonist had in his possession. I'm not sure what happens to the bad guy, but the good one gets shot, think in his shoulder and there's also this sidekick there.

My memory of this anime is really hazy and can't remember more than this, possibly got some things wrong. I appreciate all your comments, I'm starting to go crazy since I can't remember a thing from it.

fqzf12,AshenOwn,Jazz and anime is such a wonderful combination,"I have been listening to anime jazz for a good time now, and i have a fair amount of OSTs, artists, and songs i listen on a regular basis. Naturally, i try to watch everything that might have some jazz on it, and so Sakamichi no Apollon(Kids on the Slope) was on my ptw list for a long time. 

I was waiting for the right moment to watch it, as i knew i would enjoy it. After going on an intense jazz listening spree a few days ago, i knew it was the time to finally pick it up. What ended up happening, was that i watched the first 10 episodes on a sitting, i was absolutely enthralled by it. 

Initially i had intended to only watch a couple episodes, since i started it late at night, but i just couldnt put it down. I woke up today, and finished the last 2 episodes, and i can safely say that i loved it. The drama was a bit too much for me at the end, and the final scene was beautiful, but i hoped to see some more after it, like an epilogue, but other than that i certainly got more than i expected. 

The drama hit me way harder than i expected, and i need to take some time to watch some light SoL comedies now to lift the heavy feeling the show left on my chest. 

What i noticed this past few days, is just how important anime inspired jazz is to me. i love anime songs in general, and standalone jazz, but the combination of both is something that just fits like nothing else to me. 

I guess more than OSTs, what i really enjoy are jazz versions of anime songs, such as [Renai circulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGwD6AYUNyo), [Hyadain no Kakakata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WvW2de_F3I), [Shiki no Uta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiVkl_n5qvw), [Chiisana Tenohira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGN0Mwg1e0), [Sectre Base](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYNIs6HnyMY), [Orange(Toradora!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpt3R_usyLY), [Ready!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-1eq8WYU0), [Sorairo Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfdDse20abI), and [Connect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atCyevMyEVk).

I also very much enjoy jazzy game OSTs, such as Persona 5, and Xenobalde Chronicles 2, which coincidentally are also originated from Japan. Jazz remixes of games OSTs are a constant presence on my playlists as well.",4,1585454369,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqzf12/jazz_and_anime_is_such_a_wonderful_combination/,anime,1

fqyaxp,karto2287,Does anyone else work out while watching downloaded videos of anime?,"I like to be a little more productive when watching hours and hours of seasons so I dont feel as much of a shut in than o already do (plus I'm in the military so I kinda sorta have to stay fit).

So what I would do is download shows from vrv, funimation, netflix and I would then put on a 20 pound flak and sometimes even a backpack with similar weight and i would put on headphones and just climb a 3 story parking lot stairs for like 4 hours which is like 10 episodes of anime.

I feel so fulfilled and it goes by so fast cause I would get hooked to shit like the manliness of jojo adventures where I actually got the calves to match .

Sometimes I even just walk for hours with the flak on around the neighborhood similar to pokemon go days before I turned into a weeboo.


If weather is shitty o would just do a prison workout at home in front of my flatscreen pumping iron and body pushups to jojo and gabriel dropout.

The only thing I remember from the episode I watched was him driving around in a rover-type vehicle collecting data. Another one I can‚Äôt remember was about a high school age boy who lived in a world where people have magic abilities. He lives with an older couple who may or may not be his grandparents. Anyway, he goes to the capital of whatever country he lives in to start high school and he then learns that the older couple he lives with are some sort of heroes that won some big time battle/war a long time ago. He‚Äôs also way better at magic than all the other kids at his school, and if I remember correctly he kinda has beef with the son of a high ranking official.If you know what they are please let me know.",7,1585442689,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqwg0w/need_help_remembering_a_few_animes/,anime,0

**Daily Trivia:**

&gt; In a 2007 interview Hiroyuki Imaishi said that he wished he could have made Gurren Lagann's ending as ""epic"" as that of Zambot 3. In 2013 he directed Kill la Kill, whose ending pays homage to Zambot 3's ending.

fqt4xf,ATargetFinderScrub,Weekly Seasonal Rankings: Winter 2020 - Week 12,"
Hello everyone, and welcome to this week's Weekly Seasonal Rankings discussion! Here, you can rank and comment on all of the currently airing anime you‚Äôre watching each week basis, as well as discuss your opinions with the rest of /r/anime. For an example of how this works, [check out this thread from a while back]( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6nibe2/weekly_seasonal_rankings_summer_2017_week_2/).

You can format your rankings however you want, from simple lists to making a cool graphic. We even had someone use Excel! The most common way to do things is using a reddit table though. If you haven't made one, you can learn how to make one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/wiki/table-format) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/pt0wy/my_guide_to_making_successful_tables/). You could also use this [website](http://tableit.net/), which will format your table to suit reddit.

The last match with Peco and Smile has such weird, wobbly camera angles.

Ppl say naruto's nothing without kurama when he's actually still a formidable opponent and was held back because of kurama for awhile. Then there's the deku being a crybaby claim. I honestly didn't notice deku crying a lot till fans pointed it out but it didn't bother me and I think it's just hated for no reason. They also hate on him breaking his bones when he's doesn't even do that anymore.

fqpoyx,ExternalMidnight,Id:Invaded question (spoilers),"So I recently finished the show and I reallyl enjoyed it (very solid 8/10), but there's one thing I don't really understand and that's Kikis character. So we learn in episode 9/10 that she has dreams in which serial killers come in and kill her in brutal ways (this later becomes the mainframe of how the subconscious infiltration happens). 

But the one thing I don't understand is that is it supposed to be supernatural in nature? Like she is just born with that ability to transfer her dreams onto other people and have people infiltrate hers which John Walker finds out about and decides to abuse? I'm not sure I understand (or if it's ever explained) anything about her abilities or how they operate and how it is that John Walker and the other guy abused it.

Cant even begin to describe how great it feels to share something you love with your best pals. And they said they would never watch anime HA!. Cant forgot their screams as Levi beybladed his way up the female titans arm and proceeded to rain hell upon her. Or when (spoliers) as eren goes ape shit and chases down female titan and breaks her face and then literally pucnhes her fucking head off. They loved it so much. And they wanted to start watching season 2 immedialetly. This is where the dilemma begins. Do i tell them to take a break before we start again to add suspense amd build upp or immeidately dive in. I had to wait 2 years for season 2 and the payoff was well worthit. I just think some off the reveals and plot elements wont be as signigant if theres not ample time in between seasons. I may be completely wrong. What are your suggestions. Do  we take a break, wherether that be a few days or weeks or just jump straight in.

Autopilot turns on, tank locks the girl inside.  
Tank begins rampaging through a city.  
Gets up an elevated highway.  
There is a high speed chase and attempts to stop the tank and free the girl inside.

Some notable shows are the first Dragon Ball english dub ([which technically isn't lost media anymore](https://youtu.be/EvyC2-0CE7M?t=400)) and the english dub of [Magical Princess Minky Momo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/518/Mahou_no_Princess_Minky_Momo). I think [Macross: Do You Remember Love?](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1089/Macross__Do_You_Remember_Love?q=macross%20do) has a lost english dub as well, but I might be wrong about that. You can correct me in the comments.

What drawn me to Violet Evergarden was the beautiful art but when I hear she was a Auto Memories Doll I have admit into thinking the plot was going to be your generic doll coming life and learn to human with the power of love.Violet Evergarden has none of that it about a soldier trying to fit into society the show has many life lessons fitting to society and finding yourself are the main point.Violet may and like a  look like a doll but she just as human as the rest of us she just has hard time expressing her feeling because she knows nothing but the military and was treat as a weapon.

She also has lose both of her arms in battle and had them replace artificial limbs this is very common with soldiers and her being one her whole life all this is what her a realistic and interesting character it also doesn't hurt that she beautiful .Last I love about Violet is her character development is real.She doesn't become a completely different person in an episode or 2 and it doesn't a 100 or 200 episodes just for a spark of development each episode you can see a she's little different from before .

fqjhl8,somhok,Learning japanese for anime/culture! (journey),"Hey so i just turned 18. In my country we are quarantined for the next 4-6 months and all exams are cancelled. I have been putting it off for a while and plan on learning japanese to a B1/2 level. Im excited and want to beable to understand most anime, without subtitles, by the end of it!
I have a great routine, that i got in an ebook from somone who learnt the language to a B2 level in around 5-6 months studying ~2hours per day.
Im starting off with pimsleur, then i'll integrate assimil and finally glossika. Once all those are completed i should be at a really good level. At this point ill then start using italki or tandem (and any other apps) to beable to speak with natives on a regular basis. In order to fine tune my speaking abilities, so it becomes more natural and comfortable. 

Has anyone got advice for the journey, who has done something similar? Im going to dedicate 2-4 hours a day to learning the language, 7 days per week. If anyone else plans to learn it and wants to go on the journey with me, then let me know! It would be cool to do this along side someone else, so we can look at our progress and eventually beable to talk to each other in mostly japanese at any given time lol.
Im also looking to start learning mandarin in the future too, but focus on japanese alone for the next 2-3‚úå",23,1585399331,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqjhl8/learning_japanese_for_animeculture_journey/,anime,1

fqia0a,The-Mad-Katter,I can‚Äôt find anything to watch next!!!,"I‚Äôve really been struggling to find anime that I enjoy and I really just need suggestions from people! I tend to really love Fantasy, mystery, and action anime with high stakes and a big payoff. I think it‚Äôs important to mention that I‚Äôm ace/aro, so anything that has physical attraction as a center point of a story will probably bore me to death. I don‚Äôt get attached to romantic relationships, although ones formed from a deep friendship and respect for each other I can appreciate. Also if the women are treated as objects and are all just there for ‚Äúfan service,‚Äù I probably won‚Äôt like it, no matter how good the rest of the story is. Here‚Äôs a list of some of the stuff I‚Äôve watched so far and what I like or dislike about it!

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
-characters have depth, dynamic between the brothers and the characters around them is amazing, the plot twists are engaging, and the women kick ass! The way humor is used to keep the show from being super depressing is really well done, but not so overdone you can‚Äôt take the show seriously. I really love this one!

Attack on titan
-story is unpredictable and constantly throwing you for loops, the action is great, I love all of the characters, and the way the story treats death is unlike anything I‚Äôve watched before. Levi‚Äôs backstory makes me cry and Season 3 part 2 was an absolute masterpiece imo

Mob Psycho 100
-Mob is such a lovable character who also is such a badass when he reaches 100. His relationship with Arataka is so touching and his insistence that everyone should be given a chance to be a good person is so wholesome. Also the fight scenes are beautiful and the scene where Mob picked his club is one of the funniest scenes I‚Äôve ever seen!

My Hero Academia
-I love the idea of quirks and the world they create. Also Eri is adorable and Midoria is so much fun to watch! I guess I just like the way the characters play off each other and the action is engaging, even though Mineta almost ruins it for me. Guys trying to look at girls while they are bathing is not cute.

Death Note
-I liked the general idea of the plot and the chemistry between light and L was captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat, but the conflict I felt within myself wanting to support Light because he was the main character but also hating him for being so cruel and heartless was just too much for me. Also I hate the trope of the girl being head over heels for a guy she doesn‚Äôt truely know and being completely stupid and blind to what was going on. 

Re:zero
-Subaru is so annoying!!! I understand that is kinda the whole point, but it doesn‚Äôt make it enjoyable to watch. The way he treats women is terrible and the silver haired half elf (I forgot her name) feels like such a flat character. The blue haired girl is so powerful yet she and the pink haired girl think they need to be protected by Subaru.

fqhq8c,lunar_kid,YonkouProductions talks about Attack on Titan S4,"So Yonkou was live streaming and spoke about season 4 for a bit. You can watch the stream VOD [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEicBmmqwFE), but here's a slightly cut down transcript of what he said ~

""So Studio WIT isn't necessarily working on it, then who's gonna be working on it? Something that you need to understand, is that the production committee dictates who animates the series, it dictates everything. IG Port is a company on this committee, and it has 4 studios under it, including WIT and Production IG.

The question is if there's a new studio involved, what connection would it have with Production IG, and would the production committee allow it to move outside the Production IG family? I want you guys to think about that, and think about if there's gonna be a new studio, who's gonna be involved? Based on that, I want you to understand where I was coming from when I said Eren is safe. He's safe because if you do the maths on it, you realize that Attack on Titan is still within that family, and the quality should still remain the same.

The next thing you gotta understand is, because of the Coronavirus situation, we have a scenario where Attack on Titan needs as much production leeway as it can get because it's already a hectic production, and as a result of that, they will take the time that they need, using the staff that's appropriate for the series, to produce a season 4 finale that is worthy of the ending of the series.

The reason why I don't wanna say things out straightforward is because I was told to shut the fuck up, because it's dangerous speaking about these sorts of things, in the sense that the more you speak about things the more repercussions they'll have. That's why I'm not confirming or denying anything, but if you understand the circumstances of why Attack on Titan is not at WIT, you realize that this isn't necessarily a bad situation. If the alternative is a better production and staff who get the leeway to produce better quality work with more time, then how can you be disappointed? 

Now, there's a lot of attachment from the fans who are looking forward to season 4 and have a lot of attachment to Studio WIT, and understandably so - it's the staff who made it, it's the staff that made the show. So, if the staff still remain involved, then you should be ok but if they aren't, that's when question marks are being thrown around. All I'm gonna say is just wait and see, you should be able to understand the circumstances and hopefully once everything comes out, it'll make sense and you'll realize why I said Eren is safe and why I said don't worry about Attack on Titan, and why I said I cant talk about it too.""

tl;dr ~ Yonkou is hinting that season 4 is in good hands under IG port which means that the quality will be just as good if not better because the staff possibly has more leeway and time to produce a worthy final season",78,1585391784,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqhq8c/yonkouproductions_talks_about_attack_on_titan_s4/,anime,1

fqgsbe,zkP5,"Not sure if this is the appropriate sub to ask, but I have sort of a ""lost media"" situation with an anime clip I saw possibly over a decade ago.","Warning:spoopy

Apparently the lost media reddit doesn't allow things like this, understandably so.

I've tried finding this clip several times before years and years ago, I haven't recently though.

Okay, so I just turned 20. When I was pretty young (don't remember what year this could've been exactly, maybe 2010 or so?) I vividly remember watching a show called G4, don't know if you guys remember it. At least in the US it was a cable show in the mid 2000's centered around gaming and I guess just ""nerd culture"" in general.

Anyway, I was just sitting there watching and they decided to showcase some anime scene. More details are started to come back to me suddenly while writing this. If I recall correctly, there was a couple sitting on a bench in a park or something at nighttime. They started making out, and they had a shot of like, a POV of the insides of their mouths and you saw their tongues and stuff. As a kid this already grossed me out and made me feel uneasy and like I shouldn't be watching, but suddenly the girl (or the guy idk) turned into a monster or something and bit the others ones head off, and blood starting shooting out of it. Then it cut back to the live action portion of the show, and people were like cheering and shit (or clapping) and I'm pretty sure I just freaked out and ran away.

No idea why I suddenly remembered this, but I tried finding it again as a kid for years out of curiosity even though it creeped me out. I would be shocked if someone actually knew what this was off the top of their head.",3,1585387152,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqgsbe/not_sure_if_this_is_the_appropriate_sub_to_ask/,anime,1

fqgrhh,AloiPlays,No harem Romance suggestions,"Hey

straight to the point , I need some romance anime recommendations , I dislike any anime that has a harem or a not finished open minded ending , I have watched almost every single non-harem romance anime in the past 10 years , so here is what I am asking for

\- I am looking for an anime with romance , Main or subplot I don't care as long as you can ***see it*** and it ***develops and it's obvious*** 

\- **No harem**

\- **No bad old animation** ( no offense though )

I am hoping to find animes that have romance without it being tagged in there as a genre , for example

fqg94w,Drogaritory,I think I finally figured out what my issue with this current arc of one piece is,"I‚Äôve talked about how i find One Piece unfocused a lot of the time in its storytelling. By that I mean the writer never focuses on the main story/plot and is much more interested in seeing how many side characters and subplots he can cram into every arc.

While I still enjoy it I realise that the series could be so much more if the storytelling was just more concise and straight to the point. It would allow him to properly develop all of the characters he‚Äôs already introduced while using them to push the plot forward at a good pace.

Now, for the thing I actually wanted to talk about. Through out this current arc, the story has been jumping all over the place and a shit ton of characters each with their own subplots have been introduced. The MAIN plot of this arc is to take down Emperor Kaido and this is where my complaint lies, despite that being the entire point of this arc, the character Kaido has barely even been in it all.   


The writer is more interested in jumping from side character to side character that no one cares about than actually properly developing the villain and making him a three dimensional character. 

&amp;#x200B;

We literally know NOTHING about Kaido other than ‚Äúooo he‚Äôs really strong‚Äù. 

&amp;#x200B;

We don‚Äôt know anything about him as a character and we don‚Äôt know anything as an antagonist, we don‚Äôt know what makes him tick and we don‚Äôt know how his mind works and why he does the things he does on a psychological level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put, the character is one dimensional as hell and is barely even a character and it‚Äôs already getting to the point in the story where Luffy inevitably beats him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of all the extra shit with Ninja, Oden, Roger and Whitebeard flashbacks etc majority of this arc should have been dedicated to Kaido and Kaido alone. He should have been a MAIN Character in this arc. In fact, when Luffy was thrown in jail, it wouldn‚Äôt have even been a bad idea for him to have been the character the series focused on for a little while. 

Almost everything we know about the character is based on the account of other(equally underdeveloped) characters. I just feel like Oda should be more focused on fleshing out his characters as opposed to cramming as many subplots and new, terribly underdeveloped side characters into the story as much as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

dressrosa had the same issue, a bunch of new characters, all of whom had about as much depth as an 1cm puddle. At least in that arc Doflamingo was properly fleshed out though and was a fully three dimensional character.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôll just insert some melodramatic backstory for Kaido in the middle of his final battle with Luffy which will take 20 episodes to cover though.",10,1585384172,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqg94w/i_think_i_finally_figured_out_what_my_issue_with/,anime,1

When I was young I was watching the TV just hanging out, I couldn't find anything to watch so I pressed two buttons on the remote to see what fate had in store for me. 

It took me to a channel that just started playing a anime movie (possibly a series) or a little bit into the movie, my memory is hazy. All I can remember was a male character with someone else in an airport (or maybe a shopping complex), and he spots a woman wearing red, he shoots and kills her and it's revealed that she was actually a robot/cyborg. There might have been a chass scene before the killing, I'm not overly sure. That's about all I can remember of it before I turned it off and fell asleep.

fqfo9u,revoverlord,What‚Äôs wrong with dragon ball gt? Why does everyone seem to hate it?,"Personally, I find it to be the perfect ending to the DB series. Why? That‚Äôs because all loose ends were tied up and it was just a pleasant revisit to the old dragon ball series (not the Z) which was basically an adventure setting with Goku traveling the world and meeting/fighting new people. GT pays perfect homage to that by making them travel the galaxy to do what started it all -find dragon balls. Most people hating on the story tell me that the dragon ball trope is overused but doesn‚Äôt Super do the same.... the motivation for the tournaments are basically super dragon balls.... and another thing that works well with the story is the cause and effect of the black star dragon balls- that is if it is used the world will explode.... Of course the galaxy travel had its highs and lows and I feel it would have been better if they had used goten instead of trunks... for that much needed family bonding in dragon ball. Uub also had a great part in the story and the fusion with buu made him the perfect version of who he could be basically showing that you did not need to be any part sayian to be strong..the baby arc was pretty interesting to watch and the shenron arc is still better than any tournament because as it brought the story to a full circle and showed them that each wish they made would come back to bite them.... Another thing most people tell me is that the ending was shit....WHAT!
GT had a perfect ending as it basically gave goku and vegeta a choice: choose to train or be with your family... and vegeta decides that his family is more important to him than any increase in his strength whereas Goku decides that training is more important to him. Which everyone around him understands even Chi-Chi who was honestly deserved better. Though not the happy ending the immature babies looked forward to ..it‚Äôs ending was more rounded and built on the characters in general and is surely the ending the saga deserved. Though Pan was annoying in most parts of the story (like most kids) it was just further signaling the future choice Goku would have to make : family or strength. Finally super sayian 4 is the best design and hype wise don‚Äôt @ me.",16,1585381075,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqfo9u/whats_wrong_with_dragon_ball_gt_why_does_everyone/,anime,1

The Anime Tamago project's website began streaming all three anime in the Anime Tamago 2020 slate on Friday.

The three anime start at 18:00, 1:00:05, and 1:44:45 in the above-linked video. The video will be available until April 30.

The three anime were planned to screen for the public on March 14, but that event was cancelled due to concerns about the COVID-19 coronavirus illness.

This year's anime works for the project are as follows:

* Ometeotl‚â†HERO

fqez3n,BoyBrandeeno,Just finished Re:ZERO,"I put off this show for a while until a friend recommended it to me and I thought I'd give it a shot. I expected a pretty compelling fantasy/action anime, with the MC becoming a distinguished swordsman. Man was I wrong. The main character is such a freaking loser, it's pitiful. And that's why I loved him so much!

I think anyone would believe that if they were transported into a fantasy world, they are THE protagonist, taking up swordsmanship or magic or something of the like and becoming the gilded hero to save the kingdom. It's exactly what Subaru thought in EP 1 as well, and a lot of anime play off of this, and some do it really well. However, Re:ZERO takes a different route, showing us that disappointing reality that we'd probably be lost, confused, hopeless, and would probably die just as easily as Subaru did. That's where Return by Death comes into play.

At first glance, Return by Death seems like a cheap ploy to advance the plot, making the main character a distinguishable opponent to any enemy, basically being able to tell the future. I thought it was silly at first. Fortunately, I was introduced to something different and far more interesting. With every ""respawn"", Subaru carries the emotional and mental baggage of dying. Literally DYING. REPEATEDLY.  

While being technically immortal seems like something that would always work in his favor, Re:ZERO shows us that being able to die and just... plop... back into a previous ""save point"" would take such a toll one anyone, both mentally and emotionally. Feeling the pain and sorrow of death that should only need to be felt once in life, felt over and over again. Seeing loved ones die, missing out on dates, having to reacquaint yourself with close friends for the first time again. Just thinking about it is exhausting. It's what I love about this show. It doesn't shy away from showing us that. Not everyone is a legendary hero. Most of us are normal people who would break after what Subaru went through.

Surprisingly enough, the romance doesn't deter from the plot either. I can't really decide on Team Rem or Team Emilia. I mean both had very compelling arcs that made them lovable. I'm not sad about the infamous Episode 18 where Subaru chooses Emilia over Rem, but I wouldn't be sad if he chose Rem either. They both seem to represent different types of love. Emilia seems to represent the love of protection, finding someone so precious that you want nothing but to keep them safe. Rem seems to be the contrary, a love that represents security, having someone who will never turn their back on you and go to Hell and back by your side. However, I believe it made sense for Emilia to be chosen as it showed that, while Subaru is a normal person who has gone through the deepest despair, he used that despair to start from the bottom and make his way to the top and protect Emilia, despite easily being the weakest character in the entire show. (But man Rem deserves a happy ending too, so loyal ;-;)

I thought Re:ZERO would be a sword fighting anime, and I was wrong. But man am I happy about that. While those type of anime are really fun and hype to watch, Re:ZERO provides so much relatability. We can't relate to Kirito from SAO being a badass dual-wielding swordsman, or Tanjiro from Demon Slayer, going through two years of hard training to save your demon sister. But Subaru, he's just a normal dude who wants to live a happy life in this new world, just like any of us would.

I'd love to hear more thoughts and discuss!",30,1585377452,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqez3n/just_finished_rezero/,anime,1

fqekth,BoyBrandeeno,Just finished Masamune-kun's Revenge,"I began watching this show as something to watch on the side while I played video games, so I watched the dub, which is surprisingly well done. I'm pro-sub, but the english voice-acting is pretty solid.

However, watching this anime as something on the side seems to be where it shines. There were many times where I paused my game to focus on this anime, but found myself somewhat bored and continued to play. 

This show isn't bad, despite what a lot of people might say. For what it's worth, I thought it was pretty funny, had some interesting drama for a slice of life show, and the romance behind it was intriguing. The one thing it lacks? Impression.

This show will undoubtedly be forgotten in my memory eventually, overtaken by the likes of Toradora, Sakurasou, Golden Time, and many other memorable shows. Masamune-kun's Revenge didn't bring anything remarkable to the table. It's quite obvious that Macabe's revenge plot is supposed to sprout into a new-found love for Aki right from the jump, making this story pretty predictable which makes it boring pretty fast if you're giving it all your attention. However, I didn't give it all my attention, I played it on the side as I did other things. And while I did that, I found myself taking a liking to it.

I know I most likely would have dropped the show if I intended to sit down and really watch it. But the fact that I had it on, on the side is what drew me to it. It's kind of like walking through the living room and seeing a sibling watching a show that seems interesting. While this show had a lot of potential to become a great romance story, it was botched by predictability, and a pretty dumb ending (even though the ending kind of makes sense in context, as much as I hate to admit it). 

My advice? Don't think about it too much while watching, it's a lot more enjoyable that way. If you pay too much attention, its flaws will become a lot more apparent, thus losing its enjoyability.",5,1585375501,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqekth/just_finished_masamunekuns_revenge/,anime,1

I'm looking for a music video I came across on Facebook circa Fall 2017. 

It was a music video with some lofi vaporwave type song in the background, and the music video is a POV of an anime girl walking in front of you, with a farmland/dirt path background. It's just a long walk and the girl's hairstyle and color scheme changes repeatedly to the beat. The entire video is in a pastel tone, super glitched out and colors morph into each other, hard to explain but I'm doing my best.

The girl was either holding your hand or holding her hands behind her back.

I believe the title of the video as it was uploaded on Facebook was something like ""was it all a dream?"" ""she was just a dream, right?"" or ""i what if it was all only a dream"" or some shit like that, I do recall it being a lengthy title, like a phrase or something though.

fqcce4,frostpudding,"Looking for some recommendations, specific and detailed inside!","I typically like a good sports/shounen with a lot of character development. Animes that I've really liked are Death Note, FMAB, Haikyuu, Diamond No Ace, Major, Attack on Titan - stuff like that.

Animes that I kind of like that is similar to those above is My Hero Academia. I feel like there's so many characters that I cannot attach to one and there's so many arcs that I end up taking long breaks and catching up. I think Hunter x Hunter is similar and a million times better. I've also tried Black Clover but I cannot get past Asta screaming. 

I was in the middle of watching Monster - like 15eps, and I'll probably pick it up again but it really isn't catching my interest super hard right now. It kind of reminds me of FMAB (which is sad because FMAB is one of my favorite animes) where the main character is going on this main journey to do something to redeem himself because he fucked up in the past and he keeps running into all of these side quests and uncovers this big dilemma. 

I love tournament arcs, competition arcs, characters growing, and big hype. 

Not the biggest fan of 'dark' anime. The only remotely dark animes I've like are like... Parasyte, AoT, and S1 of Tokyo Ghoul. The Fate series is too dark for me. Tried Fate/Zero and saw the episode where the [spoiler source](/s ""dude murders all the kids. NOPE"")

Not really into Mech shows either. Saw the first episode of Gurren Laggan years ago and thought it was weird. I've tried about five times to get into Code Geass. Even though it's not Mech, it is a HUGE turn off. Only 'Mech' I've been able to watch is Evangelion and like Darling in the Franxx. 

I've also tried the first episode of Steins;Gate about five times and I get bored and close it out every single time. Tried Cowboy Bebop a long time ago and had a similar reaction.

I have Amazon, Hulu, Crunchyroll, and Netflix.

So why couldn‚Äôt Klein just have use the revival crystal to revive Kirito. This was honestly the last straw for the series. I‚Äôve tried to put up with it for such a long time and just can‚Äôt. The writers don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing and it‚Äôs evident by how much they just mess up an interesting concept. And the reason Kirito also would have died is because the blade was still in him after he was stabbed and it‚Äôs been seen before that if a blade is in you it‚Äôs still causes damage and I imagine the revive crystal doesn‚Äôt return you to full health. This would‚Äôve been a perfectly fine explanation then I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone would‚Äôve been OK with but the writers do not know what they are doing.",14,1585361400,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fqb8wt/the_writing_in_sao_is_so_fucking_bad_even_in_the/,anime,1

fq9gol,imseg,"Maison Ikkoku, your opinion, I had to drop it","So I love old school anime, I like slow paced and episodic series, and Maison Ikkoku is a highly praised classic. I had really high hopes, but ended up being very disappointed. 

This is seriously one of the most grating and frustrating series I‚Äôve ever seen. These are such unbearable characters, it‚Äôs maddening. The tenants are so good-for-nothing, annoying, petty, cruel and treat the main character in a downright abusive manner, but he himself isn‚Äôt much better, spineless to an extreme degree, and creepy as well(yes, different times, but doesn‚Äôt make it easier to watch).
 
These ridiculous misunderstandings which drive the plot are so dumb, which could be solved by simply talking things through, but even if the characters try they are interrupted by some contrivance.

It sucks because 80‚Äôs Japan is such a cool place, and the vibe and atmosphere of the series is pretty great. Some of the dramatic moments have a real sense of maturity to them and are impactful as well. 
But it never stays that way, it goes back to the tenants doing some petty cruelty against Godai, or Godai grabbing Kyouko‚Äôs boobs on accident. 

Sorry for ranting, but I thought this was the kind of series that captures your heart, and maybe it does in end, but I can't watch ~100 episodes of this.",5,1585354976,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fq9gol/maison_ikkoku_your_opinion_i_had_to_drop_it/,anime,1

fq98ql,WackaFrog,"LN, to Manga, to Anime adaptations","I understand that it's not easy adapting the Light novels to the mangas to the anime, while also keeping every single detail. However, I would be perfectly fine waiting longer for anime releases if they included some important details that would otherwise be left out. 
Take for example the ""KonoSuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! Legend of Crimson"" movie. As someone who only watches the anime and has not yet read the light novels, I appearantly missed a few key developments between the characters that are important to the future of the story. These details were not adapted from the light novels to the anime. I would have preferred to wait for these specific details to be adapted into the anime to get more out of the experience than have the movie release with missing details. 
As someone who admittedly does not know a whole lot about the adaptation process, are there reasons to why some things aren't adapted into the anime outside of simply needing to have the product finished by a certain date?

**Comments of the Day**

[Durinthal](https://www.reddit.com/user/Durinthal) talks about applicable tropes.

&gt; I wonder how old trope is of something breaking either as foreshadowing for or in parallel with someone's death or similar event. Here it's the dish, I recently saw another show where it was someone's sandal strap. After doing some digging I think it's generally a cross between two more well-defined tropes: [symbolically broken object](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicallyBrokenObject) where the object isn't necessarily an important symbol and [dying candle](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingCandle) where it's not necessarily a candle (many spoilers on those pages past the intro section).

[No_Rex](https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Rex) comments on Uchuuta and Keiko‚Äôs miniscule development.

&gt; Seeing more of Utchuta and Keiko makes me realize that the two of them did not really get any development, which is a shame. They should have cut out some of the extended Jin family instead.

&amp;nbsp;

**Daily Trivia:**

fq72dp,empoleonz0,Help me identify these shows?,"1) I think the one I technically remember the most vividly is this one where there‚Äôs a boy protag who I think was charged with protecting this girl and go on some adventure?  I remember a part where they get captured by bandits and they say they‚Äôre hungry and the leader of the bandits gets excited because he wants to give them his cooking which is shit so the girl cooks for them and gets on all the bandits‚Äô good side.  There‚Äôs some woman who controls snakes?  I remember some other random snippets including
- at one point the girl turns into what im gonna call ‚Äúa kawaii bat girl‚Äù and ditches the dude due to some outside influence?
- the bandit leader gets killed by this dude who i think reveals his ‚Äúnature‚Äù whenever he sneezes or coughs (whether he‚Äôs a monster or something vs human) and I mainly remember that after they defeat him they‚Äôre unsure if they cured him until he coughs/sneezes and says ‚Äúhuman‚Äù and they‚Äôre all ‚Äúyeah we did it!‚Äù
- some tower they have to climb with obstacles on each way?  There‚Äôs some fairy with a grass skirt on the 3rd floor or some shit
- the main baddies i think are an old guy, a young guy, and a girl who i think mainly assists the other two?  But i get the vague impression they‚Äôre underlings to a big bad

2) The next one I remember is as far as I can tell, some sort of harem anime since I remember a male teen protag being surrounded by girls ranging from his age to about 7-8 years old.  Unfortunately my most vivid memory involves the dude learning to swim.  Then I think they go on some kind of adventure ...in a submarine?  I also think I remember the guy meeting someone from his past and ‚Äúbad stuff happens‚Äù but that part‚Äôs super unclear.

2) The next one i believe consists of high school girls fighting demons or some shit.  All I remember is 3 characters consisting of a tall quiet dark haired girl, a tomgirlish red haired girl, and a short ‚Äúyoung girl‚Äù.  Not gonna lie though I can‚Äôt even remember if they‚Äôre the protags or the antags",4,1585347106,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fq72dp/help_me_identify_these_shows/,anime,1

fq6wjl,MachewyGooey,"After understanding the deep meaning of the Beastars anime, I've been feeling very lightheaded and unwell. Is this normal? How common is this among anime fans?","*now, i know instantly that most people will mistake this for PSD (post-series depression) but it really isnt. i dont feel sadness. i know that more seasons of beastars will come out and that there is the manga to read. please do not misunderstand me.*

well, to start off, i think ill explain how much Beastars meant to me when I started watching it.. i also advise people to know the source material to sort of understand my thoughts, but i will explain the basic premise. i will explain exactly how i feel after.

&amp;#x200B;

**EXPLANATION (quite long, apologies. if you are not interested in beastars, u can skip to the end segment.)**

well, beastars got added to netflix around 2 weeks ago and i think this is how most people (including me) found out about the series existence. ive always enjoyed the world that zootopia presented and seeing from the trailer that it was something similar caught my attention. in the trailer, it shows the divide of anthropomorphic carnivores and herbivores in this fully animal world. its illegal for carnivores to eat herbivores. but a wolf ends up attacking a rabbit through pure instinct. now throughout the whole show, the wolf continues to show interest in the rabbit. the question is, is this just his wolf instincts again or actual love? this got me super interested. i added it to my list to watch later at some point. 

i started watching it on monday and i got super hooked.  i love the characters. the world. their behaviour. **but what stayed with me the most was the meaning of everything**. the show presents many thought-provoking questions. the question of 'animal instinct or love?'. the question 'are carnivores superior to herbivores'. the question of 'are the carnivores able to control themselves simply because of what they do in secret'. 

now, some people may not see it this way but the show comments on our real-life issues as well. its how i understood it anyway (of course, anyone can interpret media however they would like). the carnivore superiority among herbivores can be connected to racism. the question of being able to control yourself can be connected to duality, secrecy or reputation (being bad people in secret, but behaving well in public. social media is a good point. the way that instagram users only show the happy moments, gives the impression of them always being positive and good people. for example.) . 

but what stuck with me the most was the question of love. do humans seek love just for the desire of self-pleasure and sex or is love an actual feeling? people always say 'love at first sight'. does that mean having a special feeling in the heart or is it simply just sexual excitement? do we tell ourselves that we 'love' someone just to hide the fact that it is for sexual reasons? *(im new to this subreddit, so im not sure if simply mentioning sexual content should get the NSFW tag. just in-case, i will.)*,  i hope that what im trying to put across makes sense. 

ive never been in a close-relationship with another person. ive never experienced 'first love' or love at first sight, or whatever, yet this means a lot to me because i witness the people around me get into romantic relationships. usually, boys are very open about their sexual interests. they do dirty jokes or they speak about women in a sexual way. im not like that and i dislike seeing guys think of girls like that. (yes i am a boy). but as anyone, i still seek the desire for sexual activity. it is part of our normal nature. i just simply hide it. just like Legoshi (the wolf) in Beastars, when thinking about meat.

his carnivore classmates around Legoshi show interest in eating herbivore meat but legoshi shows clear disapproval. however, when alone, he drools about the idea of eating the rabbit. he shows the desire to eat meat. (again, the theme of duality and love.) he hates himself for this. but he continues to tell himself that his want for the rabbit is because of love. that his attraction for her is because of love.

if it doesnt make sense yet, legoshi's desire for eating meat can be connected to the human desire for sexual activity and both reasons try to be justified with it just being a feeling of innocent 'love'. *(yes, the animals in beastars do have sexual interests, but that is not the main focus/problem that Legoshi is experiencing.)*

many fans of beastars dont view it this way, as ive been reading reviews and posts about it and it isnt something that is mentioned. but this interpretation for me makes complete sense. and im hoping that other people can see where im going at.

&amp;#x200B;

**EXPLAINING HOW I FEEL**

**so, after i realised the meaning of all that, i was shook to the core**. i started to feel that way around episode 6 when legoshi speaks with a psychotherapist which he himself explains how his feelings for the rabbit may just be his instinct. that is when i started to feel incredibly unwell. episode 6 is when i realised the big 'LOVE' message. when i watched more of the show (and even when i didnt), my heart was beating fast, my temperature was high, i was sweating underarm, my head hurt and my stomach hurt. i completely lost my appetite too. 

i at first thought that it was mental excitement from watching such a good anime. i got the pleasant feeling in your chest (or heart as people say) when your excited but the other feelings i didnt appreciate.

i read that people feel ill when really excited, because i was purposefully trying to not watch the whole anime in one sitting. there were only 12 episodes and all 20 minutes long. when i realised that i really enjoyed the anime on the first episode, i wanted to prolong my enjoyment by watching 2 episodes per day. but after i got this feeling, i wanted to finish watching it so that the feeling would go away. many of the episodes ended on good cliffhangers, so i thought that was the cause. 

today was when i watched 4 episodes and i finished season 1. i felt pleased with the series and i am definitely hyped for season 2. but this weird feeling is still continuing. its making me feel sick and im not eating much. i spoke with a friend and they think its just the after-math of understanding something truly deep. that got me thinking. i felt a similar way when i finished watching neon genesis evangelion but not to such an extent. yes, my head hurt with these crazy thoughts but i definitely still had my appetite. that got me thinking about everyone else in the anime community.

**HAVE ANY OF YOU FELT A SIMILAR WAY BEFORE WHEN YOU REALISED SOMETHING TRULY DEEP?** 

**WOULD YOU SAY THAT THIS IS NORMAL?**

**HOW LONG WILL THIS FEELING LAST? (altho i do feel better sort of ranting/letting out all my ideas. lol tyvm)**

fq62ld,FutanariConnaisseur,"I need an Anime with big, muscly dudes, a lot of training, hype and motivation. Something like Hajime no Ippo or Baki.","In recent time, I'm really lacking motivation, especially to train and thus I'm always slacking off during my training. As this moves me away from my goal of being big and swole, I gotta do somethin' against it.

Right now, no amount of Anime Openings and Power Metal really motivate me. On a side note, I can always use some recommendation there too.

Anime often motivated me to train in the past, but it's been a while since I watched one that really hyped me, so I need a new one. Shounen especially motivate me, as seeing the relatively weak MC train hard to reach his goal is always great. Thus, Hajime no Ippo was really good.

I'd prefer a Martial Arts anime with close combat like boxing or something, but Shounen like Black Clover for example would be nice too. How could you not be motivated after seeing Astas motivation?

I liked Baki too, especially the first season, as he was a lot more motivated to train and fight, but the later seasons (and the manga) are great too.

Kengan Ashura was nice, but it was a bit too short, so it sadly couldn't have real training arcs. I guess we got Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? as the training arc.

Hinomaruzumou, which aired a few seasons ago was damn motivating too and there were a lot of big muscles.

fq3tvj,Kugoji,Anyone who watched Angels of Death (Satsuriku no Tenshi)?,"So I just finished AOD, and I'm really having mixed feelings now. I loved the dark atmosphere and weird plot, but there are many things I didn't understand while watching it:

First, I really tried to figure it out, but why the hell did Rachel want to die? Was it because she killed her own parents and considered herself a sinner? If not, what was it?

Second: I really don't understand the whole ""god"" subject. The characters were talking about ""someone becoming your god"" as if they all understood each other, even Zack somehow understood it at the end, so what was the ""deep meaning"" behind that exactly?

Third: Well, I guess I shouldn't expect too much logic from an anime but I'm still gonna say it: I lost it when Zack cut the iron bars. I liked that you could just think of everything as realistic, and the supernatural things were easy to explain with the drug gas from the priest, but when this scene happened, I was so annoyed. Leave the superhuman strength to fantasy anime, because when I saw this scene, I lost all sense of relatable reality in the anime.

Zack was the only character that had a visible character development, the idea and way of thinking from Rachel and the other side characters was just too vague for me..

Am I alone in this? If yes, can I get an explanation/interpretation from you guys?",1,1585337468,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fq3tvj/anyone_who_watched_angels_of_death_satsuriku_no/,anime,1

It is an elimination type of race whit hover race cars and weapons mounted on the vehicles.

fq2ziv,arthur_rust,A journey to Neo-Venezia - Navigation 2,"**Aria is my favorite anime of all time**, so is the manga.   


Kozue Amano and the animation team spent a lot of effort recreating the real locations in Venice, especially noticeable in the last OVA (Avvenire). My wife and I went on a quest to search for the real locations in Venice. Not that It was difficult with the help of President Aria. [Link to the first Navigation here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fnt9iq/a_trip_to_neovenezia_aria_the_animation/)

**St Mark's Campanile (Arietta OVA &amp; most episodes)** \- Can be seen from almost every angle in the city, and with a height of nearly 100m, it provides the best views.

[The view from the top of the Campanile](https://preview.redd.it/rf5lm5uhe9p41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48f28cc57645765d7e3d832a7ebae42ca43ba669)

  
**Burano (Origination Ep 7)** \- North-East of Venezia on a 40-minute Vaporetto ride is the small island famous for lacework and brightly colored homes.

[Burano is beautiful and very colorful, home to \~2800 people.](https://preview.redd.it/rnztgxzqe9p41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8e9ebdcf32f0993b534519651905daa1d8c3558)

  
**Hotel Danieli (Origination Ep 7 &amp; 11)** \- In Aria, the palace built by the Dandolo noble family serves as the headquarters of Himeya Company. In our world, it's now a luxury hotel where many famous artists have stayed, consequently it was not easy to convince the staff to let us film or photograph. The lobby and main staircase are beautifully decorated.

**Dock of the Hotel Danieli (Origination Ep 7 &amp; 11)** \- To have the full Himeya Company experience, we took a gondola from the dock of the Hotel Danieli, the path leading to the pier and platform were faithfully recreated in the anime.

[The dock adjacent to Himeya Company, from which Akira the \\""Crimson Rose\\"" starts her tours.](https://preview.redd.it/gwf8w0zaf9p41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d558043adb67daa95a56f34deba1153ddd5481)

So I originally watched season 1 of hxh about 2-3 years ago, LOVED it, but fell off on season 2. I guess I didn‚Äôt understand where the plot was going so slowly stopped watching. Recently I picked it back up and got to Gon and Hisoka‚Äôs fight scene, but I didn‚Äôt understand the significance of Gon giving Hisoka his badge back. I looked up what that was about and the fight scene was still amazing without it, but I don‚Äôt think I got the full experience from it since I didn‚Äôt understand why that was so important at the time, I was a little lost during this part of the show. So my question is, for the people who‚Äôve gotten further than me or finished the show, do you think it is important to remember the major plot points of season 1 to fully enjoy the rest of the show? Also please keep out any spoilers from later in the series!",6,1585332000,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fq1xha/should_i_rewatch_season_1_of_hunter_x_hunter_or/,anime,0

fq07ze,AccipiterPC,"BNA Opening 1 - Guide to all the References to real life Biology, Genetics and Evolution.","As someone who has studied Taxonomy, Animal Anatomy, Evolution and Paleontology for over 5 years and with a Master Degree in that field, the 1st opening of Studio Trigger's newest anime, BNA, hit quite close to home. There are quite a few clever and subtle references to real life science, specifically, in the first 20 seconds sequence of the opening: from the start to the ""BNA"" title. I was very impressed with how well Yoh Yoshinari and his team did their research and put this Fantastic sequence together.

Since some of these could be missed by many people who aren't as familiar with Science, i figured i'd put together this little guide with references and explainations, for anyone interested.

&amp;#x200B;

**-1: the opening screen shows 3 DNA Molecules.**

https://preview.redd.it/a40u0if1b7p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa479807b5b98b5127a1b6c806052bf704ddc51b

This one is obvious and self-explanatory, so not much more to say about it.

&amp;#x200B;

**-2: the second screen is the User Interface of a DNA sequencer/comparator.**

https://preview.redd.it/n5zbm6z2b7p41.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a82a202b51cb7665212d528f2f4432808e624ce

When scientists compare different DNA with each other, to determine how closely related species are, how they evolved, ect... the programs used to do this pretty much display the results in an interface just like this screen: shown below, for example, is the *Actual real life UI* of one such DNA Comparison software, to see for yourself.

[source credit: http:\/\/www.montana.edu\/kalinowski\/software\/sequenceviewer.html](https://preview.redd.it/3yiwkpipb8p41.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0c9ea062dc201ac4e923fb5a2307912ae7104db)

The 4 Letters (A T C G) stand for the 4 different nucleotides. DNA is a succession of those 4 nucleotides linked together, like a long train. The order of A, T, C or G is what determines the information contained in a DNA sequence, a little like the order of letters in a text gives you information by forming words. When comparing DNA using a software, the different DNA Strands are listed vertically, and the DNA sequences are aligned with each other horizontally (as you can see in the exemple picture above) so then by looking at the display column by column, you can see all the positions where some of them have a different nucleotide.

Additionally (although this isn't done in the example picture) DNA comparison softwares all have some option to highlight (often in bright red) the nucleotides that are different in a particular column to make the whole thing more readable.

In the screen from BNA, you can see there are 8 DNA strands being compared, and that they are correctly aligned (as they are mostly identical column by column, with only a few different nucleotides in each). The Names of the Staff that were inserted inside the DNA Sequences in bright Neon Purple Japanese Characters and clearly stand out could, amusingly, be interpreted like the mismatching parts of each sequences (that whould normally be highlighted bright red in the Software). The joke is they are *clearly* mismatching in that case, not because they are different nucleotides, but because they are not even nucleotides at all, but Japanese Text!

Finally, you'll notice that in the last DNA strand of the comparison (Bottom line), slightly at the left, there is an ""x"" in the sequence. This ""x"" is simply what some software display when the nucleotide at this particular position is unknown for this strand. The simple fact that this little detail is here, again, shows that Trigger really did their research with this!

&amp;#x200B;

**-3: the next screens show a Phylogenetic Tree.**

https://preview.redd.it/se1hujqrb7p41.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829067be95250bfadbcdeaf979fea8feb84902ec

The whole right part of this screen, is the tip of a [Phylogenetic Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree). An extremely important type of Graphic scientists use to represent how different species are related to each other an the course of evolution.

like this for example:

[this simple exemple phylogenic tree gives: chicken and crow as each other's closest relatives, horse and mouse also are each other's closest relatives, and turtle as the most distant relative of all 4.](https://preview.redd.it/unhigyutb7p41.png?width=257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5acfca7a70441fc56149f55de699fe829586fdb0)

Well, more precisely, the dark blue lines are the Phylogenetic tree. The bright neon purple lines are just little optionnal separator lines that are sometimes used on very large trees, to make them more readable, though these are rarely used. They could even not be those ""separator lines"" at all, and Trigger simply only added those there for aesthetic effect TBH.

You can see the Names and Roles Credits of the Staff was added at the tips of the Pylogenic Tree, where the different species names whould normally be written. Based on what's visible of this particular tree, it gives:

""Supervisor"" and ""Yoko Matsuzaki (Fuji TV)"" (the top 2 bits of text) are each other's closest relatives, while ""Planning"" and ""Taichi Ueda"" (the bottom 2 bits of text) are also each other's closest relatives. However neither ""Supervisor"" nor ""Yoko Matsuzaki (Fuji TV)""  are very closely related to either ""Planning"" or ""Taichi Ueda"".

So, Long Story Short, they have correctly placed the credits text in the tree on this screen to group together the person's name and their role (Yoko Matsuzaki+Supervisor) and (Taichi Ueda+Planning) the same way 2 very closely related species whould have been grouped together on this Phylogenetic tree. Again, a clever Easter Egg and really shows they did their research well!

After this, the screen quickly zooms out to show the whole Phylogenetic tree:

https://preview.redd.it/35uxkl5ac7p41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09328843912426c2af0f337d09c8782bf5a8499f

The fact that it's represented in a Circle (rather than in line like the one in the example above) is merely a different graphic representation of it. It's still a Pylogenetic Tree and contains the exact same information as it whould if it was drawn in line. Very Large Phylogenetic Trees, with hundreds of species or more, are usually represented in circle like this, simply to save space. you can see many exemples of such circular phylogenetic trees if you just google for it.

The Phylogenetic Tree then blends out to become a part of Michiru's eye, which could be a nice Metaphor to Seeing/Understanding all life is related and there never was a separation between Human and Animal to begin with. As right after having seen this tree in her eye, she turns from a Tanuki to her half-human half-tanuki form, while blinking, and sees a reflection of her full-human  form in her eye.

&amp;#x200B;

**-4: next is a ""History of Animal Life and Evolution"" sequence to the title.**

The next screens shows in rapid succesion pictures of many extinct and present day animals. What's interesting here, is that the animals shown together on each frames all did live at the same time. And the order they are shown in actually follows chronology in order: from oldest to most recent *broadly speaking*. And as such they *somewhat* retrace in fast forward many of the important steps of the History of animal life on Earth; zooming out to the Title Screen ""Brand New Animal"", just as the story arrives to modern day animals, possibly a play on words on the Title.

&amp;#x200B;

**Precambrian (over 541 million years old): the ancestors of animals**

https://preview.redd.it/kz7i8ggnc7p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d126d0ab36ebe5a8a4ab3805bede335c61dcc7

Honestly it isn't obvious to me what they meant to draw with this 1st frame. It could be the infamous [Francevillian biota fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francevillian_biota) , which are considered by some scientist to be possibly the earliest known multicellular life. Or it could just be a drawing of a single cell.

Though either way i'm confident it's there to show the earliest stages of life on earth (Single cell organisms and early multicellular life), the long ancestors of animals.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cambrian (\~500 million years old): the beginning of complex animals**

https://preview.redd.it/3akqdo7oc7p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deeb6dff9f1ae4a3e8a7fe34c687ccdc4e657552

The following frame shows a [Trilobite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite) (A) and [*Hallucigenia sparsa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucigenia) (B) , 2 Very early animals from around 500 million years ago. The cambrian was when the first animals with very complex bodies and organs (such as eyes, legs, ect...) appeared rather quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Devonian (\~400 million years old): animals thrive in the sea**

https://preview.redd.it/h2i61vbrc7p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2ac28d7fe4544398c05ecb8befe311946901750

The 3rd frame shows a [Radiodont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodonta) (A) early arthropod and an [Ammonoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonoidea) (B) early cephalopod, probably a Goniatite, which lived together around that time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Late Devonian (\~370 millionyears old):**

https://preview.redd.it/o7cuj9sxc7p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8caa92266995343c40fa55e4ee2820b92fbc5e33

the 4th frame shows a [Placoderm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placodermi) (A) early vertebrate that were very common at that time, and an [Eurypterid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurypterid) (B) sea scorpion. the Devonian is also when many animals took to land and Arthropods (though not the Eurypterids) where among the firsts. Other Vertebrates (though not placoderms) also came to land during that time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Permian (\~280 million years old): animals thrive on land**

https://preview.redd.it/xipfs764d7p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9953b629d29b94f61b3eb03228321aff1f431e1f

The 5th frame shows a [Diplocaulid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplocaulidae) (A) amphibian and an [Edaphosaurid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edaphosauridae) (B) Pelycausaur, who is a distant relative of modern mammals. After taking to land during the Devonian/Carboniferous just before; animals now have fully adapted to land and thrive on it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Triassic (\~250 Million years old): Appearance of Dinosaurs and many modern animals**

https://preview.redd.it/9bpcomd8d7p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e88805dee3c0693e67fe8746e31908adce3d7a2

The 6th frame shows the rear of a modern [Lissamphibian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissamphibia) (A) and a modern [Dragonfly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odonata) (B) , both of which appeared during this time period, and still exist today. Also seen is the leg of [*Sharovipteryx mirabilis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharovipteryx) (C), a small gliding lizard-like reptile from this time period. The first Dinosaurs also appeared during the Triassic, and they have also represented this with the head of a Dinosaur in (D). Although admittedly, the Dinosaur shown here specifically is an [Ankylosaurid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosauria), which appeared only a little later during the Jurassic.

&amp;#x200B;

**the Reign of Dinosaurs and Mammals (\~230 Million years old to recent prehistory):**

https://preview.redd.it/a3zt6eldd7p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6ea13c4f2e6df0fd35abf36a5b1c7e623052406

https://preview.redd.it/38w5fbwed7p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24d91d4df894757436d3bda6cfcec91f454f94a5

The 7th and 8th frames show *mostly* a mix of Dinosaurs and Mammals, which are the 2 dominant animal groups on land from about 230 million years ago to the present day. There are a few others pictured from the same timeframe, but it's mostly Mammals and Dinosaurs.

&amp;#x200B;

**present day:**

https://preview.redd.it/rl2a703qd7p41.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2166dd0c763b1aafec92e60f94503e58aed82592

The 9th Frame shows a large mix of *ONLY* modern animals that exist nowadays, and is the only one that does not show any fossil/extinct animal. Shown is *mostly* a mix of Mammals and Birds which are the 2 most dominant vertebrate groups on land nowadays. There are also a lot of Arthropods, which are HUGELY important in terms of sheer number of species this group contain. There are a few other groups pictured too. 

Just after this, the screen zooms out all the way to the title, Brand New Animal.

https://preview.redd.it/bw6s6c5rd7p41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3a953687947fbeccc67bdf8ed68704bc261b01

&amp;#x200B;

**-5: the Title Letters flashing** ***vaguely*** **ressembles a DNA gel electrophoresis reading:**

This one could be just a coincidence TBH, but as the letters BNA are made up of small, wide rectangular cells, with some of them occasionally flashing in a fluorescent neon purple color (as you can see on the image above), this causes the title to somewhat resemble the results of a DNA Electrophoresis. see for yourself below:  


[photo credit: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/Enzyme-activity-on-agarose-gel-stained-with-ethidium-bromide-Lane-1-1-Kb-marker-Lane\_fig5\_207559796](https://preview.redd.it/bbj69zgw08p41.jpg?width=376&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19bc262e1c41c2fdae1cc41482d72458d9162cc2)

Without going too much into details, electrophoresis is a technique scientists use to sort molecules by size. It is extremely important in DNA research, or any research generally involving DNA, because in the 70's the very first methods to read DNA information to become available where based on electrophoresis. Many modern methods or instruments still use the same base principle in fact.  
To read the results, you need to put the gel pad in a dark room and shine a UV light on it, this will cause multiple small, wide bands to illuminate in fluorescent neon colors within it; the position of those bands gives you your results.

&amp;#x200B;

**-6: more phylogenetic trees are shown**  


https://preview.redd.it/wi3hh554s8p41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4815a240e8a0d8da5ea2e2c066b6f769fb1ae59

Later in the opening, during the long panning shot from 0:39 to 0:44, the white chalk lines traced on the board in the background are also multiple Phylogenetic Trees (5 of them). I've already explained about those above, so i won't repeat it here. Interestingly, the way Alan Sylvester (the blond man character) sits at the base of the figure, with the roots of all 5 trees apparently coming out of him, whould put him as the Most Recent Common Ancestor to all Species/individuals featured within those 5 trees. Though they are all written in tiny characters too small to read anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

**-7: the whole sequence follows the actual workflow of a scientific study**

Finally, i'd like to point out that the first 20 secoonds of the opening actually flow and follow each other the same way as the steps that needs to happen when doing a scientific study on animal evolution, classification and life history:

\-1: it starts from the DNA itself, and getting samples from all the species you want to study. Screen 1 shows 3 DNA Molecules.

\-2: then all these DNA samples need to be read (sequenced) and compared. Screen 2 literally shows the UI of a DNA comparison software with 8 aligned DNA strands being compared.

\-3: then you can use the comparison information to figure out how each species of your study are related to each other, and show the result in a Phylogenetic Tree. Screen 3 shows a phylogenetic tree.

\-4: finally, you can now use the information from the Phylogenetic Tree and other sources to start making hypotheses about the evolution and history of the species of your study, and how they adapted to become the way they are now. You can slowly paint a history of life on earth little by little this way. Sequence 4 is a rapid succesion of animal pictures that quickly recapitulates the history of animal life on earth and evolution, leading all the way up to the title, Brand New Animal.",41,1585327035,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fq07ze/bna_opening_1_guide_to_all_the_references_to_real/,anime,9

fpyq7c,ClowxReed,Those who like OP girl MC in SAO like game and those who like cgdct please watch Bofuri. Some spoilers,"Those who like shounen type anime but with loli can try it.

The show is simple in structure but is Anime of the season for me and may be a contender for others. It's light hearted anime with a OP Loli wreaking havoc on the other players. FYI it details how she got the skills. The show is about her but it doesn't ignore the supporting cast. They also have time to shine and grow. The season is ending and we have one week before the next starts so if you have nothing to watch between them give this a try. 

Also this is light heated Comedy so those looking for serious plot look in another place. There is plot development she joins a party, forms a guild and also participates in a guild war.

The show is made by Silver Link so you can expect their signature quality drop in the second half of the show but it's definitely not bad.

I've looked online, and the only srt file I can find is for a blu-ray version, and its off sync with the film. The subtitles come way before they actually say the lines. Does anyone know where I can download a copy that matches the digital download sold on Vimeo? You can see most of the comments on that page are complaining about the same issue. Very frustrating that they'd sell a digital copy without subtitles.

fpw79z,CloverWorks_Global,"We are ""CloverWorks"" an anime studio based in Tokyo, and we are back for a 2nd AmA!","  

Hello Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We are CloverWorks, a Japanese animation studio responsible for the creation of titles such as Fate/Grand Order -Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia-, Her Blue Sky, The Promised Neverland, Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, DARLING in the FRANXX and many more! 

&amp;#x200B;

You can find us on Twitter: u/CloverWorks_en and on Instagram: u/cloverworks_en

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Proof:  [https://twitter.com/CloverWorks\_En/status/1243515373384654848](https://twitter.com/CloverWorks_En/status/1243515373384654848) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*It‚Äôs time for our second AmA. It will begin on April 13th (Mon) 08:00 JST!\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For the second attempt, we have a production assistant and a setting producer behind Fate/Grand Order -Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia-, and Saekano the Movie: Finale respectively.    Of course, our international communication lead is also here to answer your questions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*International start times:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

April 12th (Sun)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We were blown away by the support our first AmA received on this subreddit. It was a great opportunity for us to connect with our international fans and see what questions you had on your mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Even though we were unable to answer all of them, we are thankful to everyone who submitted their questions. We appreciate you coming around and giving us your time and support. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After the first AmA, we reviewed our approach, and we believe we can do a better job at answering questions by making some tweaks to the process.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This time we will open a new thread on April 13th (Mon) 08:00 JST (International times above). You can leave your questions in that thread. We will translate them and prepare them to be answered by our guests. The guests will come in 3 hours later at 11:00 A.M JST to answer your questions. We will answer questions for 3 hours until 1:00 P.M JST.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We would be grateful if you support us by following our social media. We are working on new projects for our international fans and are looking forward to releasing some special content for you in the future.

it talked to me how great life could be if you have wonderful friends. i am so happy kakeru was saved. 
i was crying the whole time because i exactly know how kakeru felt and his thoughts are exactly the same as mine that i wanted to die every single day. i am just so happy that he was saved, that he has a reason to live every single day from now on. that ep7 was powerful! i cried so much haha.

how great it could be to have such a friends in this world?  I'm jealous.

anyway, such a masterpiece of an anime.

fpv2a3,Koukuubokan,If anime villains were smart (in short).,"Oftentimes when anime villains who are supposed to be highly intelligent do inexplicably stupid things, they do so by necessity because the hero simply can‚Äôt win otherwise. Oftentimes they‚Äôre succumb to hubris, but not all cases can be explained away with ‚Äòthey just got cocky‚Äô. I‚Äôll present two cases where the writers had no choice but to make their villains totals idiots in the final battle, please contribute with ones of your own if you‚Äôre so inclined.

1. JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure Battle Tendency, Kars‚Äô defeat.

Despite having a canonical IQ in the thousands, Kars could not see that the easiest way to kill Joseph was right behind him. If a shounen hero‚Äôs friends and family are under attack, they will risk everything in order to save them, so if he had started with them, Joseph would be forced by his very nature to try to defend them rather than running away.

2. Sword Art Online: Alicization, Quinella/Administrator‚Äôs defeat.

The only person whose power can rival Quinella‚Äôs was dead and with her superweapon destroyed by the now incapacitated magical sword of friendship, what does she do? Engage in melee combat with the hero. As previously confirmed when Kirito and Alice were hanging from a ledge, they can‚Äôt stop a fall to their deaths, so if barraging him with long-distance attacks won‚Äôt work, all Administrator had to do was to make the tower collapse while she flies to safety, optionally saving the ceiling by separating it from the rest of the structure. It‚Äôd be game over for our heroes and she‚Äôd have plenty of time to make a new laptop, or just save it as well in beforehand.",5,1585307190,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpv2a3/if_anime_villains_were_smart_in_short/,anime,1

Pros:

-Animation. The animationg is gorgeous.

-The characters. I think the characters are all great with their own fascinating ideologies and philosophies. They‚Äôe also deep and interesting.

-The twist at the end.

Cons:

-The 1st 3 episodes. They were so boring and had too much exposition shoved down our throats.

-Most of the episodes the characters just talk. I‚Äôm not sure what else they do.

-This isn‚Äôt really a con but people like NuxTaku say that the strategies in Fate/Zero put Athe strategies in Code Geass and Death Note to shame. I don‚Äôt really see the epic strategies.

I watched this show (or movie) a few years ago but I can't remember the name and i want to rewatch it. I not sure whether it‚Äôs a movie or a series but I know it's on DVD.¬†¬†from what I can remember is that the main character¬†has blond Afro like hair and is a small child who living in a foster home where they only kept him/her ( I can't remember the gender)¬†for the money.¬†The house was Christian, but they treated him/her badly especially the two other kids who weren't orphans. One bay a dark-skinned lady with long black hair burst through the window on a motorbike¬†and I think she had guns. The child went with her and they went to a very run-down¬†town that was sandy? They worked at a noodle shop¬†where I think some kids dined and dashed but that‚Äôs all I can remember.

fpsy0v,artyomssugerdaddy,Akame Ga Kill! Is the absolute best anime I‚Äôve ever watched.,"I‚Äôm sure many of you have watched it, but I have few friends who watch anime, so I felt this the right place to say this. It may not be the best all around, as imo that‚Äôs a loose term, and there may be one or two plot holes, however AGK is the best one I‚Äôve personally watched entirely. I watched it twice consecutively because I loved it so much. 

Without spoiling it, I‚Äôve watched very few anime that take leaps of faith as this one did. As the name suggests people die, and there is no set of dragon balls or Resurrection Jutsu to bring someone back. They are dead when killed. Something made painfully clear from the early beginning. 

The thing I loved most is when they brought a rival assassination squad. It showed the chemistry between the antagonist squad almost just as well as the protagonist squad does. IMO this whole show is about love and death, and accepting the people you loved are gone. When someone dies, it feels like a hole is really inside you, and you feel your heart skip a beat in disbelief. Finales of anime can be a hard thing to do, many fall short, my favorite example of this is Darling in the Franxx, however unlike that anime, AKAME GA KILL! remembers itself through and through. The last episode will leave you not quite in tears, as that was not the goal, but without spoiling it, as I don‚Äôt want to take the experience I felt from anyone else, a sense of gratification, as if you surmounted the impossible obstacles along with the entire cast of characters. 

Everything that is shown is is poetic. From beginning to end. There are so many themes that are played and replayed and molded into something new that I cannot stress enough how much I loved this show. A very short, and very sweet anime, that I suggest everyone, whether they watch anime or not, to watch. 

TL:DR ;AKAME GA KILL! Imo is and will always be one of my favorite. It shows so much love and loss at the same time. And leaves you at the end with a beautiful feeling in you. One that very few end off with.",44,1585295271,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpsy0v/akame_ga_kill_is_the_absolute_best_anime_ive_ever/,anime,1

I'm really satisfied with how they adapted it.  
I hope we get to see more of Golem and Somali's wonderful adventures in the future.

fpstb0,j1nxworld,The extremely weird way i got into anime (not long),"I‚Äôm 15, and i started watching when i was 14. i  always thought anime was really dorky and weird, and at my school you would get made fun of for watching it. well i got into anime from hentai. i know it sounds weird. sometimes i would be on PornHub and random hentai videos would get recommended to me. well over time as i watched them, i wouldn‚Äôt even be getting off because i was focused on the story, and got carried away. well i began to notice this so i went on netflix (i now have a crunchyroll subscription) and put on naruto, which was the first anime that came to mind, and probably one of the only ones i knew. I thought the first episode was good, but i was hooked in no time. i basically isolated myself from my family and had finished naruto shonen jump in no time. I moved to shippuden and finished all of it on a one month hulu free trial xD. That was early 2019, and i had kinda taken a break after naruto because i became too emotionally attached and couldn‚Äôt move on. i tried boruto and after 100 episodes i moved on. I hadn‚Äôt watched anything up until a week ago when i stumbled apon hunter x hunter. I was immediately hooked. it seemed so colorful and adventurous, and even after finishing it i still go back and listen to the endings. Right now i‚Äôm watching my hero academia but i‚Äôm still not totally sure if i‚Äôve committed to it, i‚Äôm like 14 episodes in but i like it so far. 

Thanks for reading, it feels good to have someone to tell that to, since i don‚Äôt really want anyone at my school to know that i like anime.

tl,dr: i watched hentai and liked the story so i watched naruto and binged it, then watched one punch man and hunter x hunter",20,1585294525,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpstb0/the_extremely_weird_way_i_got_into_anime_not_long/,anime,1

fpsl1m,shadohead,Do you think the fact that anime doesn't make much money off the actual content holds it back?,"As far as I'm aware, most commercially successful animes make the vast majority of their profits through merchandising. Does that hold back the quality of anime being produced?

Hypothetically, let's say we lived in a world where production houses made the same amount of profits that they do today, except 100% of it comes through anime streaming. Would we see better quality animes as a result (better visuals, stories, OVAs, etc)?",5,1585293210,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpsl1m/do_you_think_the_fact_that_anime_doesnt_make_much/,anime,1

From what I remember it was a fantasy based anime with a large group of characters, one of the protagonists had a ""second soul"" that was essentially an angry bezerker demon, and the antagonist had a sword that would kill someone's soul with a simple touch. I want to say it was out in the 90s or early 2000s.

fprn6q,GatorDreams16,Discussion: What do you think of music in anime amplifying source material?,"I've been thinking about this more recently because of the My Hero Academia festival arc. I remember reading those manga chapters and being so happy to see that smile but the 'Hero too' song that played absolutely blew me away. Everything from the timing, the vocals, the lyrics, and instrumentals hit every right string in my heart.

There are so many times when I think an anime does something superb compared to the source material, but sometimes I feel like they really miss out on what the manga/LN intended. When it comes to music, I cannot say I have ever seen it miss. Do you think that music is pretty much a guaranteed boost to the source material? I'm curious how everyone feels when a manga or LN has a music scene that gets translated into an anime.

I think anime and manga each dominate in their respective ways but seeing and hearing music from a manga always hits home for me. Similar moments I think of are from Fuuka, White Album, and Beyond the Boundary (ok it was one scene but it was fun)",1,1585288207,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fprn6q/discussion_what_do_you_think_of_music_in_anime/,anime,1

Was wondering if it is worth finishing. Overall I liked the characters a lot, but I think I lost interest due to a lack of a solid story.

fpqg1p,Apoplexy__,Getting into the Fate series,"Casual anime watcher here.  I know from watching Gigguk that getting into the Fate series is kind of a meme. I know the order by which to watch the series is debated and involved, but that's not my question.

My question is: if I were to just randomly pick one of the anime sub-series or movies at random, how bad would it be? Would it be more like:

1. Literally nothing makes sense and the meaning of every plot point is lost on you
2. You can appreciate some things and infer a lot from context so that arcs are still meaningful, but a lot of references go over your head and some of the depth is lost",14,1585282453,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpqg1p/getting_into_the_fate_series/,anime,1

fpqcq0,Booquafiusthe3rd,Plastic Memories: A show about the concept of time,"I just wanna say that that ending had me in a good amount of tears that I wasn‚Äôt even expecting. It‚Äôs funny how when I first started watching anime I found Plastic Memories but stopped at the 2nd episode because it seemed ‚Äúboring‚Äù. Back then I did have very low expectations and slice of life anime was a big no go, but after recently been getting into slice of life more and more that last episode was like a repeated kick to the balls but in a good way. The outro did sort of ruin the mood for me because it just ended off with a happy &amp; sad ending then upbeat music just starts smacking my eardrums. The concept of time in the anime was really depressing especially in the end. I forgot which episode it was but I‚Äôm pretty sure someone said something about Isla only having about 1000 hours and I thought that 1000 hours went by real quick, but then again that‚Äôs how life and our views of time is. We may remember something that seemed so close but yet so far away. Whenever I go through edits on my saved for insperation and look at the dates I keep telling myself, ‚Äúdang, to think that a year has already passed when I saw this‚Äù like that kind of thing hurts. In the grand scheme of things we are less than ants compared to everything in the universe. What may seem long to us is a blink of an eye in the universe. Though our lives may be short lived, it‚Äôs what we make of that time and from watching plastic memories, we should cherish what little time we have in this world because in the blink of an eye, time will have passed and you‚Äôre left with nothing but your memories when you die.(sorry for the dark turn I just started typing then my mind started having another existential crisis type moment)

All in all it was a pretty good anime. Though there were a few ups and downs here and there it was still nevertheless worth watching. I like to think about the future of what may happen after the ending and I feel like in a few years, Tsukasa and Michiru will hook up and become a thing.

This was literally just 2 minutes ago when I looked up the character names just so I didn‚Äôt spell it wrong apparently there‚Äôs going to be a season 2 but there is no confirmed date? That‚Äôs going to be weird in my opinion but I‚Äôm feeling optimistic and judging by one of the ‚Äútrailers‚Äù that I‚Äôve seen, if it ever comes out, it‚Äôs probably going to be on the same level as the first or maybe even better. Anyways what are your thoughts on Plastic Memories? Personally, I‚Äôd give this a 7.5/10. It was good, but some things just weren‚Äôt executed right.",3,1585282047,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpqcq0/plastic_memories_a_show_about_the_concept_of_time/,anime,1

I e been watching anime for just under thirty years, mostly just small marathons tv used to show I think the first movie's I saw were on TNT or tbs at one in the morning,  then sifi started up &amp; they were about it till they were bought out by a bigger company.  Then came the cartoon channel and they started with a great line up but watching most as sub I really hate dub now I know some show's can only be watched dubbed because of all the action or bad choices in font,  never want to miss a story line because of white on white content. So I've been kind of at home with crunchyroll but still missing a lot of content, so added funimation and was happy to find older shows that relives my childhood memories I'm upset that it only really deals in dubbed, I know you can change format to Japanese with subs but the subs don't look natural so was wondering are there any more pay sites that are mainly subtitled.",5,1585281629,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpq948/so_not_even_a_little_bit_of_a_fan_for_funimation/,anime,1

The projectile destroys the robot but splits into many pieces again and again every time the bullet touches something. Then the main characters try to get away from the ever multiplying super weapon projectile that is slowly swallowing the city!

fppjwm,red47942,So im trying to remember a name if an anime.,"I remeber this one show that i watched a few years ago on youtube when you could still easily pirate off of there. It's imagery in either the cover or intro was a spiral stair case. If u remember correctly ot involved detectives and stuff like that I think and one of the side characters was a guy that had big white hair. I could be wrong about this last detail, but I think the guy with white hair is seen by a piano in the opening.

fpo2nx,Tom_Dynamite,Nausica√§ is a freaking amazing movie,"I'm late to the game when it comes to Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki movies but I've been binging them the past few days due to lockdown and Netflix having a lot of them. I've seen a lot of the most popular ones these past days like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Porco Rosso, Kiki's Delivery Service and overall had a great time but Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind just completely blew me away.

It's one of those movies where it starts and I was just glued to the screen. From the beginning when Nausica√§ enters the toxic jungle and finds the skin of the Ohm to the last minute I couldn't look away. Visually a very pretty movie, the soundtrack is great (Joe Hisaishi is amazing) and I just love this world Miyazaki created. It's one of those movie worlds I just want to spend more time in. Also I really like Nausica√§ as a character. Especially for the time she's such a well written female character and so likeable. I really like the environmental message cause it's woven flawlessly into the story. It doesn't hit you over the head with it and I think that makes it more powerful. This movie just left me speechless, I was sitting in silence for a while afterwards just reflecting everything that happened. 

I'm sorry if you guys get these kind of posts every day but r/Ghibli doesn't allow posts like this and I really wanted to share my experience and wanted to talk to someone about it cause I'm curious what some of you think.",18,1585272612,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpo2nx/nausica√§_is_a_freaking_amazing_movie/,anime,1

fpn5zi,west_virginia_pine,Osamu Tezuka: The God of Anime (reworked),"*""I'm begging you, let me work!""*

Osamu Tezuka is a name already known in manga circles as the God of Manga. That's obvious; he was the first to create the genre, establishing a baseline for art and stories. Then he experimented and expanded, creating the first shoujo and magical girl manga in 1953 (*Princess Knight*) and experimenting with the essence of manga -- panel layout -- in 1967 (*Phoenix*; which in of itself has a convoluted history with early works traceable to 1954-1955).

On the anime side, he created his own studio, and one of the first anime studios -- Mushi Production in 1961, later morphing into Tezuka Productions.  His style continues onward (look to the eyes), and so does his format: 23 minute episodes.

Naturally he'd come to experiment, and the earliest experiment is *Tales of a Street Corner* from 1962 - one year before *Astro Boy*.

Of note -- the artstyle. A watercolor, painted look with visible brushstrokes that I've never quite seen from anime since (Studio Ghibli would be the closest practitioner, with unfinished edges pockmarking the frames of *Only Yesterday*). The brushstrokes and colors feel as if you can reach out and touch them, evoking the Impressionists of yore, the Monet, the Van Gogh, the Gauguin.

Now Tezuka has always been one to appreciate nature and condemn war -- *Tales* is no different. A tree struggles to spread pollen, rats fight over food, cabaret posters develop a human romance (I think Miyazaki and Takahata got some of their ideas from Tezuka). It's not [don't read until you've watch the film!](/s ""until the city is bombed to the ground that the seeds sprout into saplings, the rats live comfortably underground, and the posters dance together in the wind, consummating their love."")

Tezuka would condemn war in 1966, with the short *Pictures at an Exhibition*. His words on soldiers in particular, ring true now as then. Obvious Vietnam references aside, Tezuka reduces war to a laughable state. Elaborate battles, land or air, become squiggles and tangles of abstract lines; the victor and the loser lose any sense of meaning, becoming a struggle of who fights who in the web of lines and splotches.

Tezuka does the obvious and portrays soldiers as monsters, but doesn't give them the privilege of full motion -- soldiers animated as stills, giving a slideshow quality that further denounces and dehumanizes the nature of war.

Back to the history lesson -- Tezuka would join the *gekiga* movement in 1967. Believing that manga could be marketed towards adults (and adopting mature tones), he also believed anime could do the same. So began *Animerama*, a trilogy of films marketed toward adult audiences (*A Thousand and One Nights* (1969), *Cleopatra* (1970), *Belladonna of Sadness* (1973)). And Tezuka isn't subtle; every film is X-rated and includes at least two sex scenes. But Tezuka also allowed creative freedom, and so these films display Tezuka's changing style at its most abstract: live action  flow seamlessly into full animation; characters have unrealistic, unhealthy skin tones; sex is less of a union of two people than the union of multiple lines and shapes.

But *Animerama* was a failure. A failure so massive, Mushi Productions went bankrupt by 1973 and Tezuka abandoned the project when *Belladonna of Sadness*, the final film, had to be somehow created (Tezuka did contribute some ideas, but his protege Eiichii Yamamoto carried the film to term). His reputation tarnished, Tezuka would remain in manga for the rest of his career, dabbling in anime to write a movie here, direct a short there. The only remnant of his anime career was the restart of fractured Mushi Productions into Tezuka Productions in 1977\*.

\*(*I know this is technically untrue -- Tezuka actually started Tezuka Pro in 1971 -- but for the sake of simplicity Tezuka Pro didn't start in earnest until 1977*)

Now came a new decade. Tezuka was entering his 50s, and fresh faces like Hayao Miyazaki were on the rise. That didn't mean Tezuka backed down from anime; in 1984, the same year as *Nausicaa* Tezuka quietly released *Jumping*, a six minute short about a boy who jumps farther and farther.

Again, the artstyle -- an organic look perfect for clouds and trees but crumbles when depicting the manmade, the factories, the smoke. Buildings appear flat and simple, paling to the striking landscapes of forests fields and cliffs.

Tezuka's commentary on nature continues: *Jumping* can also be thought of as human evolution. While *Pictures at an Exhibition*'s final short reveals that human achievement is built on the backs of the ancients, *Jumping* shows said achievement in real time. It starts by showing the peaceful neighborhood street, the simplest of societies, coexisting with nature, closest to our Neanderthal roots; then the modern city, a blemish on nature but marvel of human construction, a great collection of miniature societies; then the nuclear bomb, the ultimate technological achievement and the most destructive.

Human society will be destroyed then rebuilt; the cycle repeats as we return to our neighborhood street. But nature will always be there, to accept us, to nurture us, to allow us to build our peaceful neighborhoods.

Concurrent with Tezuka's evolution of his themes was his style. He refined his artstyle like a fine wine, always changing it and adding new blends to his formula. We see in *Pictures of an Exhibition* that Tezuka always changes his style; we see in *Jumping* that Tezuka treats the camera as a physical object. Both are combined in *Broken Down Film* (1985), a parody of the ""woman-tied-to-a-railroad"" trope.

Tezuka parodies its age by showing the degradation of an ""old"" film; it's so bad that it affects the characters in the film. The overcranking of the film treats characters like they're in a tumble dryer, unstable vertical hold is strategically used to defeat the antagonist, and the obligatory kiss scene is marred and interrupted by grain defects.

In 1987 Tezuka was diagnosed with stomach cancer. While his life's work -- *Phoenix* \-- would go unfinished, Tezuka released one last short, a last mark on anime history. One last comment on human nature, one last comment on nature, one last comment on life. It was *The Legend of the Forest*.

A much less upbeat score punctuates the film's soundscape -- the brooding Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony. It perfectly accompanies the tone.

The tone is more withdrawn and introspective; Tezuka reflects on his themes and confirms them in this film rather than making additions. It's best seen in the artstyle, showing a squirrel's life parallel to the evolution of anime, from still images to state-of-the-art -- the evolution of his career.

The squirrel is laughed at for attempting to fly, like Tezuka was for pursuing manga -- but beyond all means he flies.

The squirrel attempts to save the forest from the humans, and he does manage to break the human's chainsaw, but he kills the old tree. Just like the *Animerama* experiment.

The squirrel withdraws, manages to fall in love, see that love murdered -- and in one last breath he sacrifices himself, killing the human terrorizing the forest.  Just like this very film, summarizing Tezuka's love and Tezuka's hopes in anime.

But there's always more humans, with more machines far deadlier than a chainsaw; the animals and spirits plan and deliberate but it falls on a ragtag group of gnomes to save the forest (*Pom Poko* anyone?). They do in the end, thanks to a rose flower, proving Tezuka's point once and for all that nature will always endure.

Like Tezuka's grasps at success, was his message true? Do we face lesser disasters than of yore, of oil spills and industrial waste? Is the challenge of climate change simply too much for humanity?

Ultimately Tezuka died on February 9th, 1989. His burial was in a Buddhist cemetery and the only testaments to his legacy are an anime studio, a son (Makoto Tezuka), and an  entire medium.

fpmy9v,Heydensan,Dub VS. Sub,"This has probably been discussed over a thousand times at this point, but why is there such a clash over the two? I believe they both have their pros and cons:

Sub:
Pros
- The original, unedited dialogue is being used except for subtitles.
- The lips match the words
- Can be used as a way to see how your grasp of Japanese is (not learn, never learn from anime.)
- Fits a Japan setting better than dub.

Cons:
- Can be a turn off for people who prefer their native language and don't enjoy subtitles.
- More time is dedicated to it since you have to read subtitles, making it harder to multi task.

Dub:
Pros
- Easier to follow and comprehend with no subtitles required.
- More welcoming of new people who are interested in anime.
- Requires less attention so you can easily play it while doing something else.
- Can fit certain characters better, especially ones with a background of English, Spanish, etc.

Cons:
- Lip animation depending on the company or how old it is may not line up
- Voice actors are more varied in quality.

fpmvr1,mythology_man,This article is really dumb and doesnt understands beastars,"[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/beastars-anime-fails-haru-sexual-upbringing-manga/amp/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/beastars-anime-fails-haru-sexual-upbringing-manga/amp/)

Here are some counter arguments me other people made against this guy and the article.

&amp;#x200B;

""1:I like how the article starts off saying the sex is creepy becuase shes short. Even though her species is White Dwarf Rabbit, like what did you expect? Every animal to be the same height.

2:He even says its ""sexual objectification of women"". Even though story is about how haru is viewed by everyone since she is a white dwarf rabbit, and how sex/dating is the only thing makes feel in control and not pitied. Pretty sad story if you ask me.

3:He also complain about how this show should be more for kids/teens and sexuality, because they censored guns. That's a really dumb argument, they not going to change the show to appeal to kids or teens. Also they havent censored guns that much compared to the  manga. 

&amp;#x200B;

4: What trauma? She was never abused. She was treated as a weak animal because of her size and having sex was the only time she felt she was treated as an equal.

&amp;#x200B;

5: BULLS\*IT! All the guys she has been with are in the same school. The rabbit guy seen in her flashback kissing her is same age as her, but instead of being a DWARF rabbit like her, he was a larger breed rabbit! Stop bringing pedo stuff where there aren't any!

&amp;#x200B;

6:She doesn't feel incomplete, she feels she's being treated as inferior! And the only time she got the satisfaction of being treated equal was during intercourse.

7: Completely missed why those were removed even though the article even writes about this not being the case because gun scenes are still there. Hint: it wasn't ""there was a gun present"". Louis doesn't have ""a love for guns"", lol. Gouhin doesn't even use a bow. He uses a **crossbow**. AND HE'S STILL KILLING PEOPLE.

Read the manga. Read the chapter where Gouhin pulls out a fucking LMG out of nowhere and kills nobody with it. It's funny, but it's weird and out of *nowhere*. The anime is much more grounded and it wouldn't fit whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

8:IT'S ALMOST AS IF SEXUALIZING AND DEMONIZING HARU FOR FUCKING A LOT IS THE POINT. Legosi mentions CONSTANTLY that he doesn't want to do that. The entire issue with the characters is that she has a reputation for sleeping around among the herbivores and then as the story goes on, we learn about the psychology behind why.""",1,1585268015,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpmvr1/this_article_is_really_dumb_and_doesnt/,anime,1

fpmlpd,ThatWrestlingGuy15,*Possibly* Unpopular Opinion,"I don‚Äôt hate Shonen films that aren‚Äôt canon and have mostly one dimensional villains and no relevance over the main plot in the manga. I think they not only give the mangaka a break not making extra content but it gives the audience a nice break from the story and is a turn your brain off and enjoy experience think a blockbuster. This is in light of the new MHA movies that are both canon but a lot of people are against them making other ones that‚Äôs aren‚Äôt connected to the main story. 

I think it not only is a good break but sometimes allows us to see more of the side characters hell I wish with how popular some of these franchises are I wish we‚Äôd get OVAs and or films centered on side characters who sometimes we feel don‚Äôt get enough love I think it‚Äôs honestly harmless material.",0,1585266954,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpmlpd/possibly_unpopular_opinion/,anime,1

Hello everybody! You may remember me from the RahXephon Rewatch, in which I made a ton of people watch a confusingly told supernatural love story. So naturally the next thing I'm gonna make them watch is a confusingly told supernatural love stor-wait, what?

Err... yeah, it's gonna be a Rewatch of the Movie Series Kara No Kyoukai. Now, given the age of this Anime (Hard to believe it's already 13 years old) some of you may not know of it. So as such:

# What is Kara No Kyoukai?

As said before, Kara No Kyoukai (Literally translated to ""The Boundary Of Emptiness"" but more often translated as the more stylish ""The Garden Of Sinners"") is a strange beast. Based on the Novels by Nasu Kinoko (Author of such works as [Fate/Stay Night](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22297/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works?q=fate%20stay%20n) and [Tsukihime](https://myanimelist.net/manga/705/Shingetsutan_Tsukihime?q=Shingetsugan)), Kara No Kyoukai is... weird. On the one hand it is a paranormal detective story which features a string of cases that, while initially unrelated do tell a larger picture. On the other hand it tells the story of [Ryougi Shiki](http://i.imgur.com/VYc8c5i.jpg), a often cold and very much broken young girl who tries to reconcile with her past, and then above that it's a dark love story between Shiki and her love interest [Kokutou Mikiya](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4df5aae5c353e44bac145cedc591d2bb/tumblr_inline_nn857qEIJL1rpjv75_1280.jpg), who by contrast the is the embodiment of an everyman. Oh and did I mention it's not even told in chronological order?

Yeah, this series is a ton of things at once, yet all of it is done in such an excellent way you don't end up caring. Everything feels as if it has focus, and the initially disjointed narrative becomes extremely cohesive by its endgame.  Plus if you're a fan of the other Nasu Kinoko works you get to see the origin of some of the archetypes he would use in later works.

Production-Wise, this was what brought [Studio Ufotable](https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/43/ufotable) into the limelight and their work here still holds up in spite of their works getting better and better. In turn each movie had a different director, giving each their own distinct identity. To compliment all of this is a haunting, ethereal soundtrack by none other than [Kajiura Yuki](https://myanimelist.net/people/5077/Yuki_Kajiura) and a voice cast comprised of some of the greatest actors of the Late 2000', with [Sakamoto Maaya](https://myanimelist.net/people/90/Maaya_Sakamoto?q=Sakamoto) and [Suzumura Kenichi](https://myanimelist.net/people/5/) in particular being flat out brilliant as our two leads (Oh and fun fact: The two actually started dating around the time the movies were released).

# Availability:

The movies are all available at [Crunchyroll](https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrC_DOCMVNelwIAgwDX9wt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1582539266/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.crunchyroll.com%2fthe-garden-of-sinners/RK=2/RS=um.Qrh9OJq_e6FHVEs6W5iLZV4c-). That said if you don't like Crunchyroll or something like that, the seven seas will always be an option (I mean, most Nasuverse fans have sailed it to get those pesky Visual Novels). I would recommend getting the Blu-Ray set but given how it's Aniplex I expect the prices to be outrageously overpriced.

# Schedule:

The Rewatch should start in May 1st at 7 PM EST. Given that these are movies, we're doing one of them every two days instead of the usual one for day, so it should last until the 21st of the same Month ending on a final discussion. I will also be throwing reminders for it 1 week and one day before it all starts.

# NO SPOILERS!:

Look, we wanna keep this newcomer friendly, so please, don't spoil anything or say crap like \*Laughs in Rewatcher\*. If using a spoiler, use the actual formatting for spoilers. Which must be written like this:

/[KnK Spoilers/](/s ""Blah Blah Blah"")

And will look like this:

[KnK Spoilers](/s ""Blah Blah Blah"")

Do note you'll have to switch to the Markdown Server or old Reddit as the fancy pants one breaks the formatting. Oh well, it's just something that must be done...

# And Finally...:

I just hope we have fun. Feel free to participate however you want: Discussing, theorizing, drawing... everything is appreciated here.

***[The one who killed the Sun named Moon‚Ä¶](https://animethemes.moe/video/CasshernSins-OP1.webm)***

Hey-o guys! This is the section where I add a ton of extra fun stuff to the main body of the post because I want this rewatch to be as fun as possible for everyone. It can also be one point of discussion for you guys if you just don‚Äôt know what to say.

**Comment of the Week:**

Comment of the Week time means I get to pick my favorite of the Comment of the Day from the past week and give it silver. This week (plus a few extra days), I give it to‚Ä¶ u/AmeteurElitist‚Äôs always amusing alliteration [from the episode 19 thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fm4n1g/rewatch_casshern_sins_episode_19_discussion/fl28e0i/)! I hope that after what a downer of a rewatch this has been for a lot of you, seeing Ameteur‚Äôs comment will at least bring you guys a little joy.

**Comment of the Day:**

Today‚Äôs Comment of the Day goes to u/Astrobrony for [doing this neat color-over-time thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fp07wn/rewatch_casshern_sins_episode_24_discussion/fli8w9i/).

&gt;So, I tried to make one of those 'color over time' things that they do for movies, to kind of show things like how the overall tonality changes throughout the movie and stuff. But like, for Casshern Sins.

&gt;[This one is showing how the color changes moving continuously throughout the show (taking every 10th frame of all 718,871 frames of Casshern Sins](https://i.imgur.com/qWkqQY0.png). Not sure what you really get out of it, but dere it is.

&gt;[And this one is the average color by episode](https://i.imgur.com/c5XOzky.png).

&gt;Also, in da process, I grabbed the number of frames in each episode. [So here's a graph of dat](https://i.imgur.com/QFdkVJY.png). You can see that the number of frames per episode is actually super consistent, with just two big spikes for the 13th and the final episode, which both have around 2,000 more frames than the other episodes.

[That‚Äôs so cool!](#awe)

**Questions of the Day:**

1) [Best boy?](https://strawpoll.com/r9wprgde)

2) [Best girl?](https://strawpoll.com/cahrywsw)

3) [Favorite of the vocal songs this show?](https://strawpoll.com/y38xbpy6)

**Comments of the Day**

[Quiddity131]() brings up a similarity of Zambot 3‚Äôs production history to that of another obscure and relatively dour mecha show.

&gt; Very interesting piece of trivia! Makes me kinda think of Space Warrior Baldios, which I think also had an extra created episode that didn't air, even before its cancellation.

[The_Draigg](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Draigg) remarks on how the character‚Äôs combat ability has improved.

&gt; The Jin family did a really good job eliminating all of those Mecha-Boosts. It‚Äôs especially impressive considering all of those ones were the most effective ones we‚Äôve seen over the course of the show. It really does show how much Kappei and the others have grown, to be able to handle them all (with help from the King Beal to actually blow them up, of course).

&amp;nbsp;

**Daily Trivia:**

&gt; Invincible Superman Zambot 3, Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3, and Space Runaway Ideon are the only Sunrise shows to have had their model kits licensed to Aoshima.

&amp;nbsp;

**Staff Highlight**

Kunio Okawara

&gt; The first credited professional mechanical designer in Japan, incredibly famous for his longstanding and beloved design work in the industry. After graduating from Tokyo Zokei University he began his career as a textile designer at Onward Kashiyama Co., before gaining part-time employment drawing backgrounds at Tatsunoko Production and eventually being offered the role of mechanical designer on *Science Ninja Team Gatchaman* by Mitsuyoshi Nakamura. After finishing work on Space Knight Tekkaman, he left Tatsunoko and founded Design Office Mechaman for freelance design work. He is best known for his work on the aforementioned *Gatchaman* series, *Time Bokan*, *Gowapper 5 Godam*, *Super Electromagnetic Machine Voltes V*, the *Gundam* franchise and its *Mobile Suit Variation* designs, the *Armored Trooper Votoms* franchise, the *Braves* franchise, *Metal Armor Dragonar*, *Blue Comet SPT Layzner*, and *Galactic Drifter Vifam* among others.

**Questions of the Day:**

1) The Bandok put up a heavy defense to deter the Jin family‚Äôs fierce pursuit. Who do you feel has obtained the upper hand in the coming battle?

2) How do you feel as to Heizaemon and Grandma‚Äôs deaths?

A while back I was at a book store and I bought some MHA merch and the clerk that checked me out gave me a recommendation for another anime he thought I would enjoy. 

AND THEN I PROMPTLY FORGOT THE NAME OF IT. :( I want to say that it was a pretty unique sounding name - with two words I believe. 

He said it was similar to MHA with it's super power focus, but it didn't have the school aspect. 

Apparently powers manifest based off of one word that your powers tie to. For example he mentioned one of the main characters had the word ""confusion or dumb?"" or something like that?

fpkuum,Oscarlover12345,My first anime Encounter,"Hey, I had a realization that I don't remember my first introduction into anime and hoped you people could help.

So, I don't remember much, I'm not sure if I ever even watched it that much, I only remember vague details about the first episode.

There was this girl, who had long black hair, and a white dress, her face was always shaded out or covered with hair... I think? She really only showed a mouth. Now I may be getting details wrong here, but I think she lived alone, the show had an emphasis on the color red for the background. The girl, I do remember that she loved Instant Ramen.

But, the first episode, a man was at her home, he just kinda invited himself in, and the girl had an attitude of not caring and just silently eating ramen. The man and setting... I feel like it took place in purgatory ore something, the man could've been Death... I have no clue, anime is fucking weird. I don't remember the actual premise, just these small details.

I think the show was on Hulu, but I can't find it without a name. If someone knows this anime, or is willing to search for me and tell me the name of this damn anime that I can't leave behind the craving to find once again. You have my thanks. But...

fpk54y,primordial_slime,Why do some shows undo progression? (Spoilers for Kaichou ha maid-sama),"I‚Äôve seen this done in quite a few anime but this was the most recent example that upset me.

I‚Äôve never watched any Shoujo series before but I do like romance and this one was recommended by a YouTuber I really liked.

At episode 6 (of 26) the male lead kisses the MC and tells her he loves her before jumping off a roof. After this scene I was excited because I thought it wasn‚Äôt gonna be one of those shows where the confession comes at the last episode. I‚Äôm so tired of this. 

But surely in the next episode they do something to totally negate this confession and basically go back to square one. 

This just leaves me asking why? It‚Äôs infuriating. 

While it is great to see how characters come to have feelings for each other, that‚Äôs not the end of the road. 

crossing that bridge just to go back is even worse. I haven‚Äôt finished the series for this reason alone. 

I saw somewhere that said they don‚Äôt become a couple until the end. Just fuck... I was really enjoying this series over all but this just cut that enjoyment in half.",47,1585258327,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpk54y/why_do_some_shows_undo_progression_spoilers_for/,anime,2

fpjv82,Suavacious,Just some words on Konosuba and its movie.,"So I just saw Legend of Crimson, the Konosuba movie, and I really liked it. The ending is quickly becoming one of my favorite endings of all time, and I‚Äôve had the urge to write about it for hours, so that‚Äôs what this is. 

I first watched Konosuba around Fall of 2017, then S2 as it aired. I enjoyed the series, but didn‚Äôt really value it *that* highly. My initial impressions were just that it was a well-produced, funny isekai. It wasn‚Äôt until I watched Goblin Slayer in 2018, and saw the celebration at the adventurer‚Äôs guild after all the adventurers had mobilized to help Orcbolg with his personal request, that I was met with a craving for some wholesome adventurer camaraderie, which inspired me to rewatch Konosuba, through a different lens this time. 

Going through the series a second time, I noticed a lot of subtlety to the way the cast‚Äôs relationship slowly developed. At first they were just a band of idiots getting up to shenanigans together, playing off of their character gimmicks, a type of dynamic you could find in plenty of anime. However, by the time S2 rolled by, something felt different. 

It still abided by that sitcom format, but the characters had a distinct sense of synergy that I hadn‚Äôt seen since Gintama, and an entirely unique sense of codependency or togetherness that I haven‚Äôt seen done in any show like it before. There was a lot of one character getting in trouble and then the rest helping them out, they went on a vacation together, and in general they fucked with each other in an organic, familiar way. With these things forming the crux of my appreciation for Konosuba as more than just a funny show, it became one of my favorite anime. I rewatched it a couple more times which solidified my take on it, and it‚Äôs with this take that I went into Legend of Crimson. 

I think the movie manages to maintain the feel of the show pretty well. The comedy was hilarious and the animation was great, especially during the Crimson Demon chuni cuts, although I feel bad for the 6 people that waifu Darkness because she didn‚Äôt do anything that movie lol. I was a little worried throughout because it seemed like it had reverted back to the S1 flavor, but after seeing the ending, I was thoroughly convinced that it was a step forward. 

So basically, in Legend of Crimson, Megumin likes two things: explosion magic, and Kazuma. These two elements interact with each other a lot throughout the film. 

Throughout the show, Megumin was probably the most useful member of the group, ending pretty much every fight with Explosion, and having by far the highest KD of the group. However, in Legend of Crimson, her magic fucks up a quest at the beginning, she ends up helpless to stop the female orcs from traumatizing Kazuma, uses explosion on the Demon King soldiers only to have more show up, gets outplayed by elementary level freeze magic on a window, ends up helpless again when Kazuma gets taken hostage, gets outperformed by an explosion gun, and then she ends up having to kill Kazuma in order to get her magic to be effective. Add in the flashback where Yunyun had to get a bad spec to help out Komekko so Megumin could save for Explosion, and there‚Äôs a lot of credibility to the opinion Crimson Demons have that Explosion is just a joke magic. 

By the end of the movie, I guess Megumin realizes this, which is why she decides to abandon her childish passion (something like a middle schooler leaving behind their chunibyou phase, she‚Äôs around that age) in order to pursue more practical magic and asks Kazuma to spend her skill points. Then, Kazuma does the *greatest act of camaraderie in the entire series*, and spends her skill points upgrading her explosion magic instead. Despite all of Kazuma‚Äôs complaints about Megumin‚Äôs obsession with Explosion magic, despite his selfishness and the priority he places on himself, despite how much easier his life would be if Megumin knew actual magic, he ultimately chooses to accept her inherent weaknesses, and more importantly, he forces Megumin to accept her own inherent weaknesses too, and to never change who she is. What a wholesome fucking moment. As soon as [this shot](https://i.imgur.com/6TITKgA.jpg) came in, I was flooded with all of these thoughts, as well as a swell of emotion.

fpifkl,ninjamurai1,A couple of questions.,"Hi, I‚Äôm doing research for an anime fanfic I‚Äôm currently brainstorming. I have some questions if you don‚Äôt mind.  
    
-In your opinion, how many skills is too many? (2? 3? 5?).  
-Do you feel MCs with multiple skills come across as OP/Gary Stu?    
-What‚Äôs your opinion on one-skill MCs?     
-If an additional skill is needed, would 20-ish chapters of training suffice so the character is shown to have earned it? (With the main plot currently frozen until then?).   
-in your opinion, how many skills is too many? (2? 3? 5?). 
  
For context, a good majority of my side characters, mooks, antagonists are multi-skilled experts, and the MC has a nasty looking streak that lasts 90% of the story. The MC has only two ‚Äúcritical‚Äù friends who don‚Äôt listen to him half the time, everyone else either ignore hims or is after him. So I‚Äôm not too worried about losing tension or falling into the other ‚ÄúGary Stu‚Äù traps.

https://preview.redd.it/yo83xp0vk2p41.jpg?width=780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a215132add9a0338f23ae850014948705760496d

*""I'm begging you, let me work!""*

Osamu Tezuka is a name already known in manga circles as the God of Manga. That's obvious; he was the first to create the genre, establishing a baseline for art and stories. Then he experimented and expanded, creating the first shoujo and magical girl manga in 1953 (*Princess Knight*) and experimenting with the essence of manga -- panel layout -- in 1967 (*Phoenix*; which in of itself has a convoluted history with early works traceable to 1954-1955).

On the anime side, he created his own studio, and one of the first anime studios -- Mushi Production in 1961, later morphing into Tezuka Productions in 1977 which still exists today.  His style continues onward (look to the eyes), and so does his format: 23 minute episodes.

Naturally he'd come to experiment, and the earliest experiment is *Tales of a Street Corner* from 1962 - one year before *Astro Boy*. 

Of note -- the artstyle. A watercolor, painted look with visible brushstrokes that I've never quite seen from anime since (Studio Ghibli would be the closest practitioner, with unfinished edges pockmarking the frames of *Only Yesterday*). The brushstrokes and colors feel as if you can reach out and touch them, evoking the Impressionists of yore, the Monet, the Van Gogh, the Gauguin. 

Now Tezuka has always been one to appreciate nature and condemn war -- *Tales* is no different. A tree struggles to spread pollen, rats fight over food, cabaret posters develop a human romance (I think Miyazaki and Takahata got some of their ideas from Tezuka). It's not until (*skip if you haven't seen the film*) the city is bombed to the ground that the seeds sprout into saplings, the rats live comfortably underground, and the posters dance together in the wind, consummating their love.

Tezuka would condemn war in 1966, with the short *Pictures at an Exhibition*. His words on soldiers in particular, ring true now as then. Obvious Vietnam references aside, Tezuka reduces war to a laughable state. Elaborate battles, land or air, become squiggles and tangles of abstract lines; the victor and the loser lose any sense of meaning, becoming a struggle of who is fighting who in the web of lines and splotches.

Tezuka does the obvious and portrays soldiers as monsters, but doesn't give them the privilege of full motion -- soldiers are animated as stills, giving a slideshow quality that further denounces and dehumanizes the nature of war.

Back to the history lesson -- Tezuka would join the *gekiga* movement in 1967. Believing that manga could be marketed towards adults (and adopting mature tones), he also believed anime could do the same. So began *Animerama*, a trilogy of films marketed toward adult audiences (*A Thousand and One Nights* (1969), *Cleopatra* (1970), *Belladonna of Sadness* (1973)). And Tezuka isn't subtle; every film is X-rated and includes at least two sex scenes. But Tezuka also allowed creative freedom, and so these films display Tezuka's changing style at its most abstract. Live action shots flow seamlessly into full animation; characters have unrealistic, unhealthy skin tones; sex is less of a union of two people than the union of multiple lines and shapes.

But *Animerama* was a failure. A failure so massive, Mushi Productions went bankrupt by 1973 and Tezuka abandoned the project when *Belladonna of Sadness*, the final film, had to be somehow created (Tezuka did contribute some ideas, but his protege Eiichii Yamamoto carried the film to term). His reputation tarnished, Tezuka would remain in manga for the rest of his career, dabbling in anime to write a movie here, direct a short there. The only remnant of his anime career was the restart of fractured Mushi Productions into Tezuka Productions in 1977.

Now came a new decade -- the 1980s. Tezuka was entering his 50s, and fresh faces like Hayao Miyazaki were on the rise. That didn't mean Tezuka backed down from anime; in 1984, the same year as *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* Tezuka quietly released *Jumping*, a six minute short about a boy who jumps farther and farther.

Again, the artstyle -- an organic look perfect for clouds and trees but crumbles when depicting the manmade, the factories, the smoke. Buildings appear flat and simple, paling to the striking landscapes of forests fields and cliffs.

Tezuka's commentary on nature continues: *Jumping* can also be thought of as human evolution. While *Pictures at an Exhibition*'s final short -- Allegorical Commentary -- reveals that human achievement is built on the backs of the ancients, *Jumping* shows said achievement in real time. It starts by showing the peaceful neighborhood street, the simplest of societies, coexisting with nature, closest to our Neanderthal roots; then the modern city, a blemish on nature but marvel of human construction, a great collection of miniature societies; then the nuclear bomb, the ultimate technological achievement and the most destructive.

Human society will be destroyed then rebuilt; the cycle repeats as we return to our neighborhood street. But nature will always be there, to accept us, to nurture us, to allow us to build our peaceful neighborhoods.

Concurrent with Tezuka's evolution of his themes was his style. He refined his artstyle like a fine wine, always changing it and adding new blends to his formula. We see in *Pictures of an Exhibition* that Tezuka always changes his style; we see in *Jumping* that Tezuka treats the camera as a physical object. Both are combined in *Broken Down Film* (1985), a parody of the ""woman-tied-to-a-railroad"" trope.

Tezuka parodies its age by showing the degradation of an ""old"" film; it's so bad that it affects the characters in the film. The overcranking of the film treats characters like they're in a tumble dryer, unstable vertical hold is strategically used to defeat the antagonist, and the obligatory kiss scene is marred and interrupted by grain defects.

In 1987 Tezuka was diagnosed with stomach cancer, the same disease that would claim his life in 1989. While his life's work -- *Phoenix* \-- would go unfinished, Tezuka released one last short, a last mark on anime history. That work: *Legend of the Forest*. One last comment on human nature, one last comment on nature, one last comment on life.

A much less upbeat score punctuates the film's soundscape -- the brooding Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony. It perfectly accompanies the tone.

The tone is more withdrawn and introspective; Tezuka reflects on his themes and confirms them in this film rather than making additions. It's best seen in the artstyle, showing a squirrel's life parallel to the evolution of anime, from still images to state-of-the-art -- the evolution of his career.

The squirrel is laughed at for attempting to fly, like Tezuka was for pursuing manga -- but beyond all means he flies.

The squirrel attempts to save the forest from the humans, and he does manage to break the human's chainsaw, but he kills the old tree. Just like the *Animerama* experiment.

Ultimately, the squirrel withdraws, manages to fall in love, see that love murdered -- and in one last breath he sacrifices himself, killing the human terrorizing the forest.  Just like this very film, summarizing Tezuka's love and Tezuka's hopes in anime.

But there's always more humans, with more machines far deadlier than a chainsaw; the animals and spirits plan and deliberate but it falls on a ragtag group of gnomes to save the forest (*Pom Poko* anyone?). They do in the end, thanks to a rose flower, proving Tezuka's point once and for all that nature will always endure.

Like Tezuka's grasp at success, was his message true? Do we face lesser disasters than of yore, of oil spills and industrial waste? Is the challenge of climate change simply too much for humanity?

Ultimately Tezuka died on February 9th, 1989. His burial was in a Buddhist cemetery and the testaments to his legacy are an anime studio, a son (Makoto Tezuka), and an entire medium.",1,1585251577,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpi3g1/osamu_tezuka_the_god_of_anime/,anime,7

fph9d2,Emlcrstf,"Looking for an anime about a dying little girl, her doctor and candles beyond the veil","Hi, I can remember watching a cartoon about a little dying girl as a kid... A doctor got called in to treat her, but found out he'd be unable to do that, so he somehow went into the afterlife, where he saw lots of candles representing everyone's life.

The girl's candle was about to go out, so he took his own and put it on top of it, trading his own time for hers... Or maybe he struck a deal with Death and Death did that, can't remember for sure.

If anyone knows what I'm on about, I'd greatly appreciate it if they let me know the name of the movie.

fph56q,TheChampis1,How does everyone prefer to watch seasonal anime?,"I just started watching anime and this was my first full season of new anime coming out, and I find myself torn between how to watch. For Isekai Quartet 2, I watched every week when a new episode came out. For Bofuri and Science Fell In Love, I waited until it ended in order to binge the entire series in one go.

I have had more excitement when the newest episode of Isekai Quartet became available, but it made the story, as short and simple as it is, harder to follow. It also allowed me to avoid being spoiled because I watched when everyone else did. I was more impatient waiting for Bofuri to finish, but I was able to fully invest in the show now that it has completed its current run. It also caused some scenes to be spoiled due to memes, such as the giant flying turtle. I'm currently torn between which I liked better, either watching as it aired or waiting for it to finish to binge-watch.

So, because of this, I want to know what you all think is the better way to watch seasonal anime and why you prefer that way. I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons, but it is feeling evenly balanced at the moment. As the spring season arrives and I find myself wanting to watch several new anime, I want to know what you feel is the best way to get full enjoyment.",20,1585248414,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fph56q/how_does_everyone_prefer_to_watch_seasonal_anime/,anime,1

fpfewy,andykhang,"Unoriginal Opinion: K-on is the foundational Moe Anime, and/ because it's the perfect Cute Girl Doing Cute Thing anime.","Doing abit of musing in quarantine season, I suddenly think of K-On again. The point is, in the title above, definitely unoriginal, and many people that's a better weeb than me have already said this better than I am (check Gigguk's Moe Anime and Under The Scope's review of it for example). Still, I feel like there're some point that need to be said even if abit repeated, and I like to said it so here it goes.

So, plot recap: K-On is **strictly** about CGDCT, about a group of high-school girl who is in a band living their cute ordinary life, having ordinary worry and from that, having a cute ordinary friendship, bond and growth, both for each of them and the bond between them. It's the true spirit, the core, the quintessential of any Moe genre before it, distilled into a formula so perfect it's practically revolutionary both then and now. In term of being CGDCT alone, K-On basically perfected the formula so great, while few can match the Moeness, I practically can't think of any Moe anime later on that surpassed it in term of just being Cute Girl Doing Cute Thing, in term of the setting of the ordinary life of cute girls, in term of being K-On. Thus, it's practically *almost* the most perfect Moe anime of all times, and is the foundational Moe anime, for later anime of it kind to copy and study.

*Almost.*

And why did I said that?

Because, for all intent and purposed, K-On is also the most *vanilla* Moe anime ever created, and that's it greatest strength as well as it singular flaw. It's singular concentration, strictly about the slice-of-life of cute anime girl doing cute anime thing, mean that while it's undoubtedly the purest form of Moe possible to mankind, it's also...pretty unoriginal (I mean, even before K-On there're already ton of high-school slice-of-life), as well as having a simple and pure plot, that while it's just pure sweet, also doesn't lend itself much degree of complexity beyond the framework of it making.

To put it bluntly, K-On definitely doesn't have any other taste other than sweet, as it perfected sweet so well it can't really go beyond it. While that's fine for people that simply enjoy a simple cute slice-of-life, for people that want more of it beyond the premise, K-On definitely doesn't provide.

Well, K-On definitely doesn't need to provide it anyway. Because as K-On give this recipe for everyone else to copy and create the Moeblob phenomenon for quite awhile, people soon realize that even if they copied K-On and make the same anime absolutely equal to it, they won't ever escape the shadow K-On cast as the original, and will be throw to the same pile of inferior moeblob anime that practically drown the market at the time.  So, people also soon realize that if they want to be different, they need to strike at the strength K-On doesn't have: Originality and Complexity.

Thus, cute girl travelling the apocalypse thing ( like Girls Last Tour and Made in Abyss), cute girl doing obscure thing (like Dumbbell), and cute girl doing amazing thing (like At the End of the Universe), to name a few example. Expanding it on the Moe genre in general, and you could practically see that practically anything have a Moe anime to it (like Moe-absurb-comedy Nichijou, Moe-transformer anime that I forgot the name of, and many many art about stuff being Moefied), all stemming from the need to be different and unique from the Moeblob phenomenon which K-On started with.

Thus, K-On is so perfect, practically everyone learn from it example for every other Moe anime later on. And K-On also have it perfect imperfection of simpliscity that many other future Moe anime take advantage of, basing the formula K-On perfected before and adding a few twist, and practically creating a new wave of Moe anime that we still enjoy to this day.

And as such because of that, K-On have become the foundational Moe Anime, not only for the anime after it, but also for an entire new generation building on it very solid (and very sweet) groundwork it have made. Bless KyoAni for such masterpiece, and hope they could recover to create more anime like this.",23,1585242993,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpfewy/unoriginal_opinion_kon_is_the_foundational_moe/,anime,0

fpext0,whotsop,Albert from Gankutsuou is one of the worst anime protagonists I have ever seen,jfc this dude‚Äôs na√Øvet√© goes way beyond my suspension of disbelief and the man has an IQ of a fucking walnut. He just comes across as a massive prick 99% of the time. I know he largely serves to remind the Count of his former self but did the series really have to make him the main character and spend the majority of its time showing him bitching about everything and denying reality to a ridiculously unrealistic extent?

fpex14,modeljapan2008,help me with this question: what genre of anime would you say i like?,"if someone asked me what sort of anime i like, what would you say if you were me?

the anime i like:

shinsekai yori,

sidonia,

grimgar,

made in abyss,

evangelion (and madoka, which is a little similar similar, if you haven't seen eva),

elfen lied,

girl's last tour,

higurashi

my answer at the moment: mystery fantasy scifi, some horror, not really into action or everyday life, i like mature stuff with a strong plot .  sometimes i say i like ""girly scifi"" because i like shinsekai yori (and sidonia) a lot and my friend said he fell asleep when he tried it, so i was wondering if those are considered shoujo rather than shounen/seinen (coz more mystery/drama and less action). but at the same time i didn't get into a lot of horror or mystery anime really yet (like Monster, Mirai Nikki, Mushi, Another, Shiki). but honestly that's probably just my weak attention span and i should give them another go (maybe not mirai nikki, too actiony/like a serial).

anyway, if you would me, and you liked the above anime a lot, how would you tell someone briefly what sort of anime you like? ""mystery fantasy scifi horror?"" i guess it's good enough...

the reason i ask this because in japan most people won't know the names of most anime, let alone the names of them in english",6,1585241437,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpex14/help_me_with_this_question_what_genre_of_anime/,anime,1

fpeh0i,simyen,Question/discussion regarding profile pics,"Okay, so here's the deal, more often than not you come across a profile with an anime picture, wether it's on Reddit, or YouTube or Facebook or any other place, doesn't matter. What I find curious is that out of all the anime profile pictures I've seen, I have never seen a single one (at least from what I can remember) that has a character from Dragonball. I mean you see all kinds of pics, most have a character of some sort, but nowhere have I seen a DB one. What's up with that? Why is that do you think? Please discuss",12,1585239990,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpeh0i/questiondiscussion_regarding_profile_pics/,anime,1
fped6x,draztico,Is the position of MC is a cursed catch-22?,"The entirety of this post is mostly anecdotal opinion. I simply wish to see your thoughts/perspectives on this.  
    
I‚Äôve been thinking about the usual tropes that normally make a large majority of MC‚Äôs unlikeable, or at least less liked than the side characters of their respective shows.   
   
There are exceptions of course. But then that‚Äôs the thing, that a satisfactory MC *is mostly an exception.* Most shows appear to be carried by side characters. One could even argue that most shows could work ‚Äúwithout the MC‚Äù with just some tweaking.   
    
Outside of those exceptions, the position of MC is kinda cursed, falling into one of these three positions:   
      
1. If an MC is already competent(in any degree) and/or experienced from the get go, it can be dismissed as  unrelatable/Mary Sue territory.  (In some cases, the Mary Sue term is warranted. However, it‚Äôs also been applied to even *remotely* competent characters, or so I‚Äôve seen). 
   
2. If the MC is an underdog, the premise is generally undermined later on by some special/cheap shortcut like ‚Äútrained by best teacher‚Äù or ‚Äúbloodline‚Äù or ‚Äúhidden power‚Äù and/or otherwise is dismissed as the chosen one trope.  
    
3. If the MC is that rare ‚Äúaverage joe‚Äù underdog with *no* special stuff, it can be very refreshing....until you realize ‚Äúhow is this underdog the MC when far more competent/experienced characters exist?‚Äù. It‚Äôs rather hard to justify. There is ‚Äúworking hard‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the MC can or should surpass those who were already ‚Äúworking hard‚Äù, especially ones who have talent that are also working hard. At the same time, Switching to an already ‚Äúcompetent/experienced‚Äù MC falls back into the first point (unrelatable/mary Sue territory).   
    
Regarding the above, what are your thought on this? Is the position of MC an inescapable catch-22?",17,1585239631,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fped6x/is_the_position_of_mc_is_a_cursed_catch22/,anime,2

So where on Earth did this trope come from? And why is it so common? Is this some secret fantasy that the Japanese silently agree on?",22,1585235683,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fpd6x6/explain_this_trope_to_me/,anime,0

fpbnwy,baseballandy,Question: Does this anime exist? Or am I just crazy?,"Hi everyone! I would really appreciate your help with helping me figure out if this anime is real or if I'm just crazy and think it is, and if it is real could you please please please please give me the name of it? I don't remember much about it but I had a dream about it last night and now it's bothering me so much and I just have to watch it again!! It's driving me crazy that I can't remember it though. I do think it's one hundred percent real but the problem is, is that I can't remember the main overall premise of the anime. I only remember dreaming about this one ""episode"" last night.

The premise of this particular ""episode"" was that their class had to compete in some kind of game..and the MC of the series (a guy) was the ultimate target and the goal of the game was for him to not get caught by anyone otherwise he lost. There were a few other people on his team that couldn't get caught either and some of them played honestly but then there were a few that turned on him because there was one girl, and I'm pretty positive that she was an instructor of some kind (or something like that) to these kids and she was infatuated with the MC and some kind of deal was made between them or something that if she caught him he'd go on a date with her or something like that. So of course hilarity ensues with her chasing him all over the place trying to catch him, some of his friends turning on him to try and help her thinking that it'd help them ""get in her good graces"" and stuff like that. 

I know it's not a whole lot to go on and I'm probably not doing a good job of describing this ""Episode"" really well but it's all I can remember. I want to say that the entire premise of the anime was that they were in some kind of classroom training to be like..secret agents or assassins or something like that but I can't remember for the life of me.

I know it is not Assassination Classroom and I've got this feeling somewhere that it is in Baka to Test Ni but I don't feel like that's right either. 

I know this is not a lot to go on and that it's quite vague and all that but I would appreciate any help that you can possibly give me in remembering this anime or if it was just a figment of my imagination or maybe even a recollection of a manga I once read or something like that.

The only things I remember are that the protagonist was a white male living in Japan in a large city that was heavily controlled by the government to the point that people had microchips implanted into their necks. The protagonist was working in a park and cleaning it to perfection (since the government dictated it) not sure tho if it was his work or maybe a punishment for not following thee rules. Then there was another man, a rebel of some sort who was living in the ""outside world"". Everything around the main city was kind of destroyed and messy with a lot of metal and rubbish lying around. Kind of a destroyed world as a counterpart to the clean and perfect city. That's pretty much all I can remember.

Seems many reviewers (or fans in general) seem to get frustrated by dialogue.

I'm late to Attack on Titan--I""m binging it now, and I'm watching an episode of a few people talking in a tree after a big reveal. \[spoiler\](/s ""The episode where beast titan and armored titan in human form are talking to Eren."")

If found it intriguing and loved how it built suspense. Why don't they hate each others guts? Why no generic super villain cartoon rants? Why is one of the villains apparently so self-restrained in demeanor? What's at play here? Why is the fourth party out on the tree hinting that there's a third side to this? Lot's of undertones going on.

For me, I think even action driven series work well with suspense. I found it one of the strongest episodes in the entire series up to that point.

I want to get to know more about him, his motives, his aspirations but in the anime, he was one of the less shown characters. That's why I turn to this sub to help me understand his character. In the end of the anime, Hohenheim had a recollection about the time when the dwarf was still in the flask and Hohenheim asked what happiness meant for him. The dwarf answered ""I won't ask for anythinf extravagant. I'd be happy if I could somehow leave this flask."" I thought that was a moment of modesty and vulnerability for the dwarf. However, for the rest of the anime, he was murderous and showed no liking towards humans. What was he really after? Why did he do all of the stuff he did which resulted to the deaths of millions?

One day a coworker asked me if I watched it and I said ‚Äúno but I‚Äôve always been open to it‚Äù which was something I have said many times. He told me to see if I could find one that I liked and the idea somewhat interested me so I took a quiz online and browsed some websites and landed on an anime called ‚ÄúElfen lied‚Äù. A name  I recognized because 7 years ago when I was 11 my older brother showed me the first 10 minutes because of I guess ‚Äúlook violence lots of blood be shocked and you‚Äôre so innocent haha.‚Äù Anyway I payed the show another visit and watched the whole show in 2 days. I absolutely loved  it and it made me wanna get into a lot more anime‚Äôs. I watched shows such as ‚ÄúFuture Diary‚Äù, ‚ÄúDeadman Wonderland‚Äù but I found myself enjoying shows like ‚ÄúGirls Bravo‚Äù, ‚ÄúMonster Musume‚Äù and ‚ÄúChobits‚Äù. Watching and loving all of these shows made made me feel good about myself, because I was able to enjoy shows 95% of the people I know and my friends would take one look and be like ‚Äúthe hell no gross‚Äù. This also has me wondering what that says about me as a person, and why/how I possess the ability to deeply enjoy what most (at least what 95% of the people I see on a daily basis) shy away from. It really makes me want to hear from those who posses the same ability, or as I call a gift. A gift because I really have been enjoying anime lately I watched 16 in a month.

fp7gip,nick235989,Deciding to give slice of life a try was the best choice I ever made.,"When I first watched anime I mostly just watched the action and fantasy anime. I thought slice of life would be boring as how could an anime about daily life be interesting. I decided to give slice of life a try and now I prefer this genre over the action genre. Theirs just so many ways you could go with slice of life and their have been so many slice of life shows that have resonated with me or made me nostalgic remembering past friends/memories or just have made me think about certain things in life a different way. Slice of life has really affected my life. I love the bittersweet moments when I watch a sad slice of life movie then go walk at the park just enjoying the moment and contemplating what that anime I just watched has taught me and how I want to move forward in life. 

This doesn't just apply with anime though. It could be a really deep book you read or the lyrics of a song that resonate with you and make you nostalgic or a beautiful video game with a great story that draws you in. I really am grateful to the people who make all these different art forms though. Maybe one day I'll try to put my feelings and life experiences into an art medium. If you are reading this and are one of those people thank you. I really wish society would put more emphasis on the arts and humanities. It would be a dull and even more cruel world without  them.",70,1585208478,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fp7gip/deciding_to_give_slice_of_life_a_try_was_the_best/,anime,1

fp67mz,BentPixelsLoL,Which animated show is right for me?,"Hi all!

I want to get into the world of anime, but I don't really know where to start. The only anime shows I have watched so far are Pokemon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. I loved them both, and I have always wanted to start really diving into the anime realm, and what better time to do so than during a pandemic?

I enjoy shows with a lot of action. I am a HUGE fan of Marvel and DC so I love superhero movies/shows. I also love mystery and a little bit of horror/suspense as well, along with comedy. I don't know if this helps at all, but I don't want to start on a show that doesn't match my taste and end up never watching anime again just because of one show that didn't click with me, if that makes sense, so I'm kinda trying to just describe my tastes and what I find entertaining so I can start on the right track. 

Some non-anime shows I loved were The Witcher, Parks &amp; Recreation, Rick and Morty (even though I'm sure that counts as anime), and Daredevil/The Defenders. 

I'm in pretty unfamiliar territory with all of this, so I apologize if this isn't the way people describe shows they like or if I'm doing it wrong lol. If you want me to go into more details about my taste(s) feel free to ask, as I am happy to provide more details. Please let me know what show seems to fit my criteria (or even if it doesn't... I am totally open to trying new things).

fp59f2,sandsundertale,"Watching Beck, am I missing something?","Decided to pick up Beck after hearing a lot of things about it. I'm about half-way through. 

&amp;#x200B;

The story is alright, I didn't expect an amazing story but it's certainly not bad. The characters are generally great, barring minor characters. Koyuki definitely pricks at my side at times but he's won me over with his singing. I'm guessing this is very much a character-driven show, and I'm enjoying that part. The music is my favorite part, no surprise since I was mostly drawn in to watch because of the rock aspect of the show. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, there are some things that I found that hold it back from being a good show for me.

&amp;#x200B;

On many occasions, scenes feel so ... awkward. There are awkward pauses in the middle of conversations, and the lack of background music adds to the awkward tension. I've also found that some scene cuts obstructs the flow of the story pretty roughly. 

Less occasionally, there's awkward animation, especially in some of the brief fight scenes, where I found the sense of weight non-existent. 

And halfway through the story, it starts to feel weirdly paced? Or rather, I'm unsure why some plot points happen? I think this particular problem arises from the fact that I'm unsure just what to expect from Beck at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

fp4tdd,Purpl3_Suns3t,I don't think I will ever forget Violet Evergarden,"I am not the most prolific anime watcher, and most of the series I have been into were things like FMA Brotherhood or Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works.
Before recently, My Hero Academia was practically the only thing I was keeping tabs on. 

Then everything started shutting down and I was told to stay home and I looked around at shows everyone says were very good. A week later and I can say that Violet Evergarden was the most emotionally engaging show I've ever seen. The stories they told each episode were beautiful and the music and art took it to a level I have never seen. It felt surreal. I'm 23, a dude, and I didn't cry when my grandparents died. I just spent 2 hours tearing up watching an animated television show touched in a way I never expected.

fp4rc9,Patrickstar789,Good animes with cool MCs,"First, sorry for my english, guys.

So, I'm really tired of seeing the same kind of MCs in so many shows. It's either the pathetic wuss who's always overreacting to the most simple interactions with girls and is incapable of standing up for himself; the nice guy harem lead, who's too dense to even notice people's feelings; or the typical hero who will refuse to kill even in a life of death situation against literally the most evil being ever.

So I'm looking for some recommendations on animes with different characters. Not necessarily a super badass that kills every man and fuck every woman (although I wouldn't mind something like that for a change, lol), but more of a character that just feels like an actual person instead of just being a overexaggerated stereotype.

Here's some examples of MCs I liked, in no particular order:

Rintarou Okabe - Steins; Gate
Sakuta Azusagawa - Bunny Girl Senpai 
Hachiman Hikigaya -OreGairu
Light Yagami - Death Note
Kazuma Sato - KonoSuba
Arata Kasuga - Trinity Seven
Ikki Kurogane - Chivalry of a Failed Knight
Kirito Kirigaya - SOA (yes I actually liked him. But mostly during the first half of season 1 and in Alicization).

And a few characters I absolutely hate:

Yukiteru Amano - Mirai Nikki
Mahiro Yasaka - Nyaruko
Ooyama Takeru - Maken-ki! (Yes, the entire show was awful to begin with)


TL;DR: please recommend me good animes with MCs that aren't super annoying.",13,1585194895,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fp4rc9/good_animes_with_cool_mcs/,anime,1

fp31on,Inferno221,"Since the last arc of bleach is being animated, what issues do you have that you want addressed? [Spoilers for Manga]","So the last arc has a lot of issues as I‚Äôm sure most people are aware of. There are huge flaws that the anime has a chance to address to make a good story.

Recent example of a big story failing is game of thrones. If anything, that last season should be a lesson to people around the world that casting, art, sound, picture is nothing compared to writing. It is the foundation of the experience. Without good writing, the experience suffers. Badly.

The last arc of bleach is not good writing. It has a lot of potential to be good, and during the livestream of the announcement, the jump chief editor said they can‚Äôt reveal details about the anime yet, but they want it to be good because it‚Äôs the last arc.

Its not much words to go by, but it does give this fan who used to like bleach a little hope that this anime is a 2nd chance to give bleach a satisfying climax. So what are your issues that you think need to be addressed?",13,1585187739,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fp31on/since_the_last_arc_of_bleach_is_being_animated/,anime,1

fp2zqd,uhiokay,A Silent Voice : The Movie was bad??,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this shit made me cry and the art was beautiful but overall I thought the plot was weak and didn‚Äôt really make sense logically? I really really wanted to like this, and would love for somebody to explain to me why it‚Äôs good because I cannot for the life of me understand the hype. The beginning in elementary school really had me, but the time skip to high school started to lose me real quick. Maybe it makes a lot more sense if you actually read it but I think the main thing I hated about it was this weird pushing of unnecessary friendship. I understand that a lot of the characters are supposed to be unlikeable, but they should at least be believable? There's hardly any character growth?

Here is everything I hate about it, not necessarily in order:

- When ueno pops back into the picture, she literally begins by RIPPING OUT NISHIMIYA‚ÄôS HEARING AID AT THE RIPE AGE OF 18. THEY AREN‚ÄôT CHILDREN ANYMORE, NOW SHE‚ÄôS JUST A BITCH.
- She clearly doesn‚Äôt have good intentions towards nishimiya, but keeps hanging around and both nishimiya and ishida do jack shit to stop her? Neither of them like her, and yet both of them are basically like ‚Äúthis is fine‚Äù. They don‚Äôt have to beat her ass (although they should), but they‚Äôre old enough to decide who they choose to be around? It‚Äôs not even like they‚Äôre being forced to see each other during school, they be hanging out AFTER SCHOOL ON THEIR OWN ACCORD
- Ueno starts acting real possessive over ishida, BUT SHE LITERALLY DOESN‚ÄôT KNOW HIM. THEY HAVEN‚ÄôT SPOKEN IN YEARS, she‚Äôs just holding onto a memory of him from childhood. Maybe that‚Äôs the point, but still doesn‚Äôt make sense - now she just CRAZY AND A BITCH THIS CRAZY BITCH. Like when ishida is hospitalized, ueno starts dutifully taking care of him right after physically assaulting nishimiya?? ISHIDA‚ÄôS MOM WITNESSED HER THROWING DOWN ON NISHIMIYA AND HER MOM, BROKE UP THE FIGHT, AND STILL LET THIS BITCH VISIT HER SON?? She doesn't even question who ueno is, despite the fact that ishida literally had no friends like 2 weeks prior. She even tells ishida to thank ueno smh.
- NISHIMIYA APOLOGIZES TO EVERYONE FOR BEING SUICIDAL AND EXISTING IN 6TH GRADE?? SHE HAS NO REASON TO APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE FOR THIER BULLYING AND LACK OF PERSONAL GROWTH WTF
- They super glazed over shimada and what‚Äôs his name saving ishida from the river? What happened to good ol paramedics? Plot twist, shimada is a paramedic.
- ^ this was the only other time shimada was brought up besides that weird donut encounter. Shimada is probably the only character I would actually be interested in seeing more of from the original friend group, since he was once ishida‚Äôs ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù, but instead all we see is UENO, sahara, and kawai.
- The ginger dude‚Äôs sole character trait is that he ‚Äúhates bullying‚Äù. That‚Äôs literally it. And after years of ignoring ishida like everyone else, one day he suddenly decides he ‚Äúwants to be friends with him‚Äù???
- The scene on the bridge w/ everyone is so pointless? They bring up old shit, only to conclude that nobody has changed AND THEY BASICALLY WEREN‚ÄôT EVEN FRIENDS TO BEGIN WITH, THERE IS NOTHING TO SALVAGE
- Kawai and ginger act like they were so worried about ishida once he recovers, but once again they barely knew him AND IGNORED HIM FOR THE MAJORITY OF THEIR LIFE
- THIS ISN‚ÄôT A BEAUTIFUL STORY ABOUT FRIENDSHIP all the ‚Äúminor‚Äù characters fake af and back on their same bullshit
- ISHIDA STILL DOESN‚ÄôT KNOW THAT NISHIMIYA LOVES HIM

In conclusion, the only character I truly stan is Maria.",14,1585187518,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fp2zqd/a_silent_voice_the_movie_was_bad/,anime,1

Hagoromo also wants to destroy the hidden leaf and go to make a new planet to make this population. Naruto, Adult Boruto, And Sasuke try to stop him because he knows all ninjutsu moves. They realize they must destroy him with his own moves. Hagormo wants Boruto's eye the pure eye to destroy the entire universe and create a new planet of his own. This planet will only consists of uzumaki and uchiha. Boruto will never give him this power of the jogan or pure eye. Sasuke dies by hagoromo. Sasuke gives his rinnegan to boruto before he dies. While sasuke dies boruto unlocks six sage mode. Hogoromo sees it and wants the power. Naruto is very injured and cant help. Boruto realizes he has to defeat the sage/hagoromo with his own moves/power since hagoromo created ninjutsu and knows all moves. Sarada sees boruto and helps him. Sarada and Boruto create a new move called the ultimate almighty storm. This move destroys hagoromo and hagoromo asks why hes so powerful. Hagoromo says he did it to make boruto stronger as he was considered weaker than naruto. Hagormo gives boruto all his power. His power allows him to time travel through the cosmos. Naruto gets up and congrats boruto. Naruto returns to the village and continues as hokage. Naruto is congratualted by the hidden leaf. Naruto tells the village boruto and sarada saved him and shall be a legend of the village. Boruto and Sarada told naruto to tell the village they were sacrificed trying to protect the village from the six sage/Hagoromo Otsutsuki. They do this in order for Boruto and Sarada to be legends as sasuke and hagoromo would want. Naruto renames the village hidden leaf to Sasuke Village.

In the shows OP, you can see multiple instances of Subaru, one replacing the other, while the first one fades away.

This leads me to believe that Subaru does not go back in time. Instead the Subaru we see die, actually dies and does not come back. We then hop into a different universe where we meet a different Subaru that inherited/has the ""old"" memories.

One argument against this comes from Isekai quartet S2(so take it with a grain of salt). Here we can see Ainz use a time stop spell, which various people familiar with time magic resist. Since Subaru is one of those, it could mean that he does travel back in time.",10,1585179770,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fp0y2a/the_true_horror_of_rezero/,anime,1

fp0bca,pimpinelephant,Need help with identifying whether this copy is real or fake.,"Hey guys, I wasn't exactly sure where to post this but I figured here would probably be the best place since you guys know more about this kind of stuff than anybody else.

I recently found a copy of The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki, which as we all know is bootlegged like crazy!

I have read many different posts about how to tell the difference between the real copies and the fake copies, such as  
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9mstuh/watch_out_for_bootleg_anime_on_ebay/  
as well as watched many different YouTube videos about the same topic.

I feel fairly confident being able to tell apart the real thing from the counterfeit ones, unfortunately I have zero clue about this one. So I was really hoping you guys could help me out with this dilemma.

Here is an Imgur album of all of the available pictures I currently have at my disposable (my apologies beforehand since these are quite poor quality photos):

https://imgur.com/a/qUQkbD8

&amp;nbsp;

I know that the counterfeit versions will always have the film reel placed outside of the description page lining the outside box, which is the case here but this is a used copy so I'm not exactly sure what to think in this circumstance.  
https://i.imgur.com/3IjHZKn.jpg

I was honestly leaning towards this being a counterfeit copy until I saw the blu-ray discs themselves. I know that bootleg blu-rays will always have a different color underside, a common color being black.  
I also know that legitimate blu-rays will always have a silver underside. I have always heard that this is one of the telltale ways of telling the difference between a legitimate blu-ray and a counterfeit blu-ray.

The issue is that these discs actually have a silver underside!  
https://i.imgur.com/5SRO1B5.jpg

&amp;nbsp;

I honestly have zero clue whether this is a legitimate copy or a counterfeit copy. I keep second guessing myself and changing my mind. This is why I was really hoping to get your guys' help and advice.

Anything you guys can share with me to help with this issue would be so greatly appreciated! Thank you guys in advance.",2,1585177527,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fp0bca/need_help_with_identifying_whether_this_copy_is/,anime,1

**Comments of the Day**

[No_Rex](https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Rex) considers whether last episode‚Äôs action can be topped.

&gt; There obviously will be a ""final battle"" against butcher and probably Gaizok, too. It remains to be seen whether that will be a more climactic battle. Today's episode had two well-orchestrated lines of action (the prisoners and Kappei) which interacted repeatedly (the stones, the drowned mecha, the internal explosion). In terms of action direction, it easily was the best of the series so far and I suspect it might be the best overall.

[Durinthal](https://www.reddit.com/user/Durinthal) speculates on K≈çzuki‚Äôs potential fate.

&gt; Genuinely surprised Kouzuki made it out at the end, but I really don't foresee him surviving the series. The one exception to that is him being the lone survivor (maybe along with the other girl whose name I can't remember) while Kappei and the rest of the Jin family sacrifice themselves, so that he can tell the tale of how they saved the world.

&amp;nbsp;

**Daily Trivia:**

&gt; Episode 20, The Night Before Battle, was made using a large amount of reused footage from previous episodes, this is because an extra episode of the show was ordered after production had wrapped up.

fp055r,Mekazuaquaness,Black Clover is no longer a unapologetically shonen anime,"Not a manga reader just wanting to point out things I‚Äôve noticed because the anime is now bleeding out with future potential right now.

After the recent arc had completed I assumed that was going to be the peak of black clover. It was the accumulation of every major single event that has happened to the black bulls in the past 100+ episodes with a near perfect conclusion to it all. You‚Äôd think this is a good stopping place for the anime but no it slaps you in the face with whole new uncharted territory which was alluded to from the beginning but was set aside.

That‚Äôs not the reason I think it has potential. The reason is because in these last few canon episodes black clover has been actually focusing on the importance of dialogue and information gathering through plot rather than constant fighting. The best part is how every character in the black bulls are slowly breaking away from their character tropes which actually makes them likable.

If you like shonen such as naruto, bleach, fairy tail I urge you to give this show another chance. Ima tell you straight up the first 60 episodes (50% of the show so far) will be pretty trashy but if you can tolerate all of that (fairy tail fans will definitely be able to) then you will be rewarded for making it to the point it‚Äôs at right now.

Prediction: I promise you a year and a half from now Black Clover will probably become part of the new generations Big 3 and people will start talking about in the same level of respect as my hero academia 

Quote me on this and tell me if i was wrong or right a year and half from now. Have a good day everybody",32,1585176931,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fp055r/black_clover_is_no_longer_a_unapologetically/,anime,1

fp04xq,DemonSlayerV7,I just finished Code Geass,"It was a very good show, it took long for me to finish it, because I only watch one episode a day. I found it even better than Death Note, with more characters, they being much more important and relevant than Death Note where it was practically carried by Light and L, I also find it more regular, Lelouch is also much more interesting and complex than Light.

It was interesting in the end when I saw Zero and I thought they were showing a cycle where every time when appears a hero, he ends up being corrupted and ended being the one he swore to destroy like Lelouch, but I wasnt expecting that all that despotism was made on purpose by Lelouch, because he couldnt be the face of the future, so he was planning his death all along, he wanted to be hated. I liked the happy ending, where Lelouch got everything he wanted, his death scene was incredible, he died satisfied for concluding his objective and very happy, for seeing that his sister understood his real intentions.

Its soundtrack is fenomenal, I will start to listen to it now. I understand why this anime is so talked now and I am happy for have seen it.",27,1585176910,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fp04xq/i_just_finished_code_geass/,anime,1

**SPOILERS FOR ERASED, HEAVY SPOILERS FOR THE ANIME AND LIGHT SPOILERS OF THE MANGA!**

&amp;#x200B;

**GO WATCH THE SHOW AND/OR READ THE MANGA, THEY ARE WORTH YOUR TIME!**

&amp;#x200B;

**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!**

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says i just finished the best anime I've ever watched. Every single moment of the show was amazing. The music, the story, the characters, the FANTASTIC animation, all of them pieced together, made me forget about all the stuff that's going on in the world right now with Covid-19. I swear those were the best 2 days I've had this year... until the ending.

I know i'm not the first (and hopefully not last) to complain about the last 2 episodes of this masterpiece, but these 2 really fucked me up.

Almost everything is wrong about them.

I know that the whole thing was rushed to fit the 12 episode schedule... but from I've read in the manga (just light browsing, nothing serious) I believe they could've easily made a season 2 and show enough details so we wouldn't feel completely alienated when Satoru wakes up, maybe even put in the original showdown with Yashiro.

AND THE YAKO PLOT TWIST... OOOO BOY!

I'm not a shipper (the type of guy who ships all the characters in all the shows) but I was really rooting for the 2 peanuts and the plot twist Kei pulled off is one of shittiest ones I've ever seen. Literally 2 thirds of the anime were spent on this one character and the developing relationship between her and Satoru. And of all the characters, they chose Hiromi...

I don't hate Airi but I just believe that an ending with Kayo would've fit much more nicely. I feel tricked, backstabbed and bamboozled.

For the last 2 days i was just comtemplating the 4 hours is spent watching and researching for even a drop of hope for a season 2 or an different ending where Satoru And Kayo end up together, but nothing, not even the live action movie and netflix adaptation helped...

But what are your thoughts on the ending? Do you have any news regarding the future of ""Erased"" ?( ·∂¶  ∞·µí·µñ·µâ À¢·µí)

You think I'm an idiot who just wants to see characters get together?

fozdy5,Gattsu2000,"Why I Love ""Welcome To The NHK"" (2006)","I remember when I saw this at 17. I was obsessed with the anime. It reached a place that felt a lot like home. I was and still am a guy who always struggled to connect with other people. I got very anxious when I tried to commit to social things and I spended most of my life like a ship with no sailor in a severe storm that harshly moved around everything in the ocean. I wasn't sure about my future or my ambitions. I just did whatever until I would come up with something. I tried joining a club and stuff but I felt I never got anything from those and they just felt dull to be in. I wasted 1 and 30 minutes being on a place where I didn't knew anybody and that made me realize something about myself or something about others. I was usually this turtle who never came out of his shell and when I actually tried to get out, I just ended up disappointed or I accidentally shot myself on the foot. After all of those failures and because I was too lazy and scared to meet my responsibilities or improve myself, I just ended being alone in my room. Not even my mother at my house could get to me because I always sealed myself from human interaction. I would just be this parasite that would consume the food that my mother would work hours for, watch anime and masturbate. And having this kind of free time and free things would make you think that you might be really happy but you're wrong. I was stuck in a lifestyle that was both very unproductive and also, self-destructing. The more I indulged myself into the life of a slacker, I grew more desperate, lonely and depressed. I hated myself for what I had become and I sometimes desired to just simply disappear so I do not have to aknowledge how miserable I felt and how useless I was. I grieved for human connection but at the same time, I was very afraid of it. I hated that I didn't do nothing but consume but at the same time, I just didn't decide to stop doing it. It has become an addiction which was very complicated to control and which made me fall deeper into the darkness. I screamed in my head: ""You're worth nothing!"" and ""everybody laughs at you"". I couldn't even feel pity about myself because I always thought it was entirely my fault. I created this misery for myself and that affected my mother. I was afraid into growing into a man that forever would be a fat parasite never moving out of the apartment.

And ""Welcome To The NHK""... understood that feeling so well. All of these horrible things that can go through the mind of a Hikkikomori, it was able to capture but not just capture it but also, empathizes. Really than just telling me to just feel ashamed of who I am and that this is it for me, it tells me that it isn't too late. It tells me that I can change and that I am not a useless piece of meat and bones. It told me that It may be hard and that there will be failures but that if you try, you will improve and you may find others that will help you stand up high on your feet. It empathizes but it doesn't fetisizes the life but shows you the consequences of It and gives you an answer to get out of it. It sees what it is to be someone that lives this and that may be because the writer of this series was a Hikkimori himself. Just like myself, he felt all of these things and decided to share this with the world and make these people feel less alone in their situation. And it does this while also being the funniest thing ever and also depressing and emotional at its core.

The characters are fantastic. They are fun, humanly flawed and have nice chemistry/interactions with each other, which is ironic for a anime about social anxiety. Satou is very relatable and funny character. Misaki is both wise and with scars on her life. Yamazaki may be pretty selfish and hypocritical but showing truth of the isolated people and having his fun moments with Satou. Hitomi is a character who while not as relevant in the story, has a great impact on the experience and showing another aspect of people suffering from mental illness. And having all of them together making for a very fun character-driven story.

Welcome To The NHK is a powerful but also hilarious anime about social anxiety, depression, consumerism, trauma, loneliness and also, about hope. A anime that made me smile at a time where I was going through desperation and made me see that being a Hikkimori is not hopeless and that I shouldn't let my guilt have complete control over me.

It is not perfect, of course. The animation, in particular, is not that special and it can be kinda inconsistent but this anime is so well-written, hilarious and so much fun that it doesn't matter all that much. Not to mention that it is a anime that deeply resonates with me on a very personal level.

*Watch the world burn*

(*This won't cover the manga. Since there's no part two* (*we were promised one and we have waited seven years so far*) *read the manga beginning at chapter 20, where the anime ends.*)

While sick with the flu, I stumbled upon *Aku no Hana*. I laughed at it for having a stupid name -- ""The Flowers of Evil"" sounds like the title of a bad fanfiction. I watched the first episode on a whim, then the second then the third...

Immediately apparent: the anime is not normal anime. It's closer to a live action film, with cinematic camera angles, realistic backgrounds, realistic people. The anime is entirely rotoscoped -- animated actors traced over the movements and speech of real actors. The effect is both minimalist in detail but ornate in capturing expressions.

*Aku no Hana* is about middle school student Kasuga Takao. He is interested in a popular girl in his class - Kinoshita Saeki - and ends up stealing her gym clothes in a lustful impulse. The moment is captured by delinquent Nakamura Sawa who forces Takao into a binding contract with her.

Thus begins an express elevator to Hell.

The show's grinding pace on top of an uncertain protagonist mixes into a grueling watch. It's hard to watch not out of shoddiness but dreadfulness. You want to scream, yell, hit Takao to do the right thing -- but he can't. He is no superman but a teenager run by his impulses.\*

\*(*And admit it -- we as teenagers* have *succumbed to our impulses before. We do stupid things that, looking back, were ridiculous. Even the smartest of us. Takao's like the rest of us, and viewing ourselves doing similar things makes us cringe.*)

Powerless. It slaps you in the face. Takao is doomed to walk the path laid out by the show. All you can do is watch.

His crippling refusal to say no, his crippling refusal to speak the truth; even the core of his being is a lie, his love of *Flowers of Evil* fabricated in a vain attempt to stand out. The only attachment to humanity is lust; the same lust that pulled the straw breaking the camel's back.

Which forces us to look elsewhere for hope; our eyes instantly dart to Saeki. The innocent rose, the porcelain masterpiece, the coup de grace of this tale.

That's exactly the issue: she's viewed as too perfect to Takao that he refuses to accept the truth. His delusions refuse to be shattered, too strong to accept that Saeki is a girl of flesh and blood. 

Even Saeki herself has crippling issues, namely her over-commitment to Takao. Her friends question what she sees in the guy.

Hope lies in the unlikeliest of places: Nakamura Sawa. The most nihilistic, the most dangerous -- and the most broken. Nakamura is a character we've hated for the entire show; my hatred peaked at episode 7.

Then the facade slips -- she smiles at Takao. Hints dropped that she may love him. A smile here, a whisper there.

Nakamura is the crown jewel of the show, the harbinger of the show's messages. She represents all that is dangerous and all that is broken with today's teenagers. Yes, teenagers are manipulative; but it's their childhoods, their parents, their mothers (Nakamura's mother has been missing and she clearly takes more from her than her dad or grandmother) that nurture them. Yes, teenagers destroy; but the destruction is to express a feeling, a yearning for love or a call for understanding.

Nakamura's actions have a new meaning when you interpret them as a call for help; she bullies Takao because she wants him for herself, she insults everyone because everyone insults her -- their ostracization results in her ostracizing the whole.

If *The Flowers of Evil* isn't a call for attention to the abandoned teenagers of the world -- then it's a portrait of the dangers of teenagers. It shows what happens when the young are dumped in a decaying town, the emptiness of rural Japan, and left to their own devices.

And it's a beautiful spectacle.",4,1585169746,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/foy2ih/aku_no_hanathe_flowers_of_evil_2013_thoughts_on_it/,anime,1
foy18z,gonzatomon,Animes similar to Attack on Titan animation style?,"I'm pretty new to anime, the only ones I've watched start to finish are Inuyasha, Yu Yu Hakusho, and now i just finished the last season of Attack on Titan.  I loved all three of them, but Attack on Titan's art style and story was pretty much the absolute peak for me. It was like a masterpiece. What first drew me to it at all was when I saw how it was illustrated on the Hulu section screen, the art is what drew me in .

Are there other animes that have similar art style and a good story? I've researched and have decided on trying Tokyo Ghoul, does anyone have any other recommendations?

I don't like the typical ""kids and less serious"" anime's such as Dragonball Z, My Hero Academia or Sword Art online. Just can't take them seriously anymore.

I do love the more ""serious and adult"" ones though. I have watched so far:

* Attack on Titan
* Vinland Saga
* Dororo
* One punch man and Mob Psycho ( I know it's not serious but the animation was epic and it is hilarious)
* Monster
* Claymore
* Code Geass
* Parasyte
* Erased
* The one where the kid has a book and any name he writes dies

fowasr,Nymphe348,I just finished an anime ... and I have to reflect.,"He conveyed too many emotions to me, I was happy to have been part of his story, I was happy to have met such endearing characters, to met a world beyond ours, to see the laughter and tears of its protagonists, as well as I felt sad for having finished it. Magic in anime will always exists the first time you saw it, although it is true that there are many anime that you could see again and again, it will never be the same as the first impression, since it will be what marks you from that series in particular.

But which anime was the one that unleashed these emotions on me? Well, that doesnt matter, since I think all anime have that capacity. One of the purposes of art is the power to transmit emotions. You know an anime is memorable because it produced a bunch of emotions on you. Happiness, sadness, love, even tears. If a series manages to create on you those feelings, it is because it is worth seeing. It does not matter if the community in general tells you that it is a mediocre anime, or if it is one of the most hated, the really important thing in these shows is the own value that one can give it. Everyone will tell you that the plot is the most important thing, or the characters development, even if all of this fails, there will be those who defend a series only for its animation/sound. Bullshits. Although these aspects objectively define which works are masterpieces and that others are mediocre, they do not define the value that it has for you, because that is characteristic of each one. It doesnt matter if you do not agree the 10 best anime according to MAL, if you favorite show has more haters than fans, your tastes are what define you, and are what will make you enjoy each series differently, because what each series provokes in each one it is something that cannot be qualified, it is part of our personality, it is part of us. Its our way of seeing art.

I suppose this is more aimed to people new to the anime, like me (I have had 60 series, which I consider to be very little yet), and even with the short time I have been in this community, I know there is hatred for quite a few shows, hatred for the fans of those shows, for those ""overrated"" shows. Overrated is the most random word that exists in anime communities, pretty much every show I've seen has the overrated flag on it. Anime itself cannot be overrated, it is not a mainstream product. So if you enjoyed a series, do not feel bad if everyone says it is trash, as well as if you are interested in one that everyone says is trashly, you must not care. Watch it!, objectively it is very likely that it will be garbage, but that wont affect the value that you will give to it, in fact it is very likely that youll enjoy it a lot.

I hope I can enjoy anime for many more years, and I hope you do too. I hope you don't get bored of hundreds of generic shonen a year, or that you suffocate with the guy that was transported to another world at the whim of fate. Every anime ever created has the possibility of creating emotions, you just have to get out the critic of the academy that is inside you, and keep it locked up in the bottom of your wardrobe. Remember that it is spring, and although she is not with us anymore, emotions will always be with us.",4,1585163937,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fowasr/i_just_finished_an_anime_and_i_have_to_reflect/,anime,1

**Poem of the Day: Mourning**

The Japanese title of S3E24 is „Åã„Åú„Çí„ÅÑ„Åü„Åø or ""Kaze o itami"" (Crunchyroll: When winds send waves crashing), which refers to the first line of [Poem 48](/r/chihayafuru/wiki/hyakunin-isshu#wiki_48._minamoto_no_shigeyuki) by [Minamoto no Shigeyuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamoto_no_Shigeyuki). This is the second time we‚Äôve seen this poem this season, as S3E24 is the sister episode of [S3E9](/e8em9f) -- and as such, more context on the poem can be found linked there.

Again, using MacMillan‚Äôs translation that captures the waves against the rocks imagery a bit more explicitly:

&gt; Blown by the fierce winds,

&gt; I am the waves that crash

&gt; upon your impervious rock.

&gt; Though my heart shatters,

&gt; my love rages yet.

Although the Crunchyroll title focuses on the crashing waves imagery, probably because of Chihaya‚Äôs focus on Taichi being the waves to her rock, the Japanese title of ‚ÄúKaze o itami‚Äù is actually closer to ‚ÄúBecause the wind is fierce‚Äù. This is interesting, as ‚Äúitami‚Äù puns into words like to mourn (itamu - ÊÇº„ÇÄ) and painful (itai - Áóõ„ÅÑ), which only only fits the mood of this episode -- Chihaya and Taichi, but also the Mizusawa karuta club, aren‚Äôt just hurt, they‚Äôre mourning the loss of something integral to their lives and truly feeling pain.

Something that I love about this poem and its usage in Chihayafuru is that it captures the inevitability of heartbreak. As written in S3E23‚Äôs writeup, Suetsugu always had a focus on the fragile relationship between Chihaya, Taichi, and Arata, where despite their progress as individuals, one misstep could change their friendship forever. Waves naturally are drawn to shore and that‚Äôs exactly what Chihaya is to the two boys. Whether it‚Äôs Arata being returned from the darkness of his self-blame or Taichi joining the karuta club again, Chihaya is their gravity and her pull is inescapable. It‚Äôs a really romantic image and, though the show doesn‚Äôt always focus on love, it makes the romance that much more alluring and ‚Äòreal‚Äô and I appreciate it a lot.

Before we look at what happened this episode, let‚Äôs check out the S3E9 sister episode. That episode starts with Chihaya on her school trip, wondering how Taichi and Arata are doing at their Masters qualifiers. Taichi, unfortunately, loses the Chihayaburu #17 card, the one card he can find ‚Äúno matter where [...] with [his] eyes closed‚Äù, to Shusaku and goes on to lose in luck of the draw. And, of course, the card that he lost was [#57 ‚ÄúMeguri aite‚Äù or ‚ÄúAt long last we meet‚Ä¶‚Äù](https://100poets.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/an-old-acquaintance-poem-number-57/), a card which both represents his feelings for Chihaya and Arata through imagery of the moon. With his failed confession and Chihaya attempting to quell her complicated thoughts to the two boys, the events of S3E9 foreshadowed the conclusion to this season.

Coming back to our season finale, S3E24 makes no qualms about taking the episode poem and highlighting it in the most unsubtle way. The episode opens with a very in-your-face card and full poem translation, which is reused several times throughout the episode to get their ""waves crashing against rocks in vain"" theme across. Mr. Fukasaku even invokes and explains the poem to Chihaya at one point.

**04:20** - Fukasaku: ""When the winds are at their strongest, the waves crash into the rocks, only to fall apart themselves. Just like those waves, my own heart is in danger of breaking apart, as I continue to pine endlessly for you.""

At the very start of the episode, the breaking apart part of the poem is evoked with a scene where [Taichi walks away from Chihaya](https://i.imgur.com/47Kk4lg.jpg), across the railroad tracks, after kissing her on the lips. It‚Äôs pretty on the nose.

Just before Mr. Fukasaku's quote above, Chihaya's line to him was,

**03:59** - Chihaya: ""I-I... I... was the rock. I was the rock, and I... c-crushed them into pieces. Taichi's feelings... all these years... All that time, I... I... ""

And in that context, then Taichi's confession represented the waves crashing against the rock, and the kiss was Taichi‚Äôs -- the drifting boatsman from last episode's #46 poem -- last act before the currents swept him away from shore.

But then Taichi, too, is a rock that Chihaya dashes into and breaks into tears for -- it's been pointed out that his name contains the world for island after all. Her rock theme has always been more based around the #77 (se) poem, the one that goes,

&gt; 77: Swift waters parted by the jagged rocks, are joined at river's end.

Which in this season has been symbolized by the double confession, when all poor Chihaya wanted to do was play karuta. This brings up the question though -- why did Chihaya chase after Taichi? Whatever the case, we can see #46 intertwined with #17 (Taichi and Chihaya‚Äôs respective poems) when Chihaya tries to study at 6:25 and when Taichi meets Suo right before that, which just shows how much their actions weigh on each of their consciences. Ultimately, the episode is quite blunt about it and there's no big revelation or anything, but we'll discuss this more at the end of the episode.

---

**00:24** - Koda: ""I know you said you want to be a high school teacher, but if the main reason for that is because you want to be a club advisor... Frankly, I'm not sure you could handle the job with a motive like that.""  
**00:36** - Koda: ""Teaching is a tremendously complex profession. Have you ever considered how difficult it is to deal with real people?""  
**00:51** - Koda: ""Being loved and being hated are two sides of the same coin!""

Chihaya's new homeroom teacher starts off the episode with a conversation that Chihaya probably didn't need to hear at the moment. At this point, she was still in the club, since she was present at the orientation meeting at 02:00. But why did she quit the club? We are left to wonder if this conversation, basically telling her that her efforts were in vain if her motive was wrong, was part of her reason for quitting the club soon after.

By questioning her aim to be a high school teacher and club advisor, he was also indirectly questioning her decision (and the cost involved!) to skip her Queen's match in favour of ""her future"" and of having the experience of a class trip with her friends and team, directly contrasting Taichi's path of isolation and putting his self-improvement in karuta before anyone else. And then, the club orientation happened, and Sumire stepped up to the fore while she lurked at the back. It's not inconceivable that [these thoughts that the boys had](https://i.imgur.com/XNF0PQ4.jpg) mirrored what was going on inside her own head.

02:03 - Sumire: ""I'm second-year Hanano Sumire, and I'll be in charge of guiding all of you. I'd like to thank all of you first-years for your interest in joining. Our third-years have entrance exams to study for, and I'm sure some of you are beginners, so I'll provide guidance and explanations of the basics.""

But, this should also parallel some words by her last homeroom teacher, Mr. Fukasaku, in S3E2:

**S3E2 11:30** - Fukasaku-sensei: ""Still, in my mind... the words of the many who came before me are the treasures I have inherited over the years. And to pass them along to all of you, to sell them secondhand, is why I became a teacher.""

Even though Taichi ran away after being rejected, and Chihaya ran away after him, the lessons that they taught have passed down to the next generation as well, and even though Sumire herself was rejected by Taichi, she stays in the club and seems poised to help guide it into the future, even after her senpais leave. This, then, might be partially why Chihaya's scene with Mr. Fukasaku was so important later on, even if his advice was a bit cryptic at first -- but we'll leave that for that later section.

---

**01:17** - Reiko: ""What have I always told you? You're the type to hold things in, so you need to exhale constantly! Focus on breathing everything out...""  
**01:26** - Taichi: ""I quit the karuta club, so the next one will be better.""

The breathing scene that she does has connections to the theme of wind, as per the episode poem, and of Dr. Harada breathing in all the air around him to propel himself forward like a hurricane, another reminder that Harada is a potential future ""end point"" for Taichi. But Reiko has been set up as a minor antagonist to Taichi and the club, and Koda's last comment about love and hate being two parts of the same coin, juxtaposed with this scene directly after, also shows an interesting side of his household.

Reiko's run-in with Sumire earlier in the season doesn't seem to have left any effect on her relationship with Taichi, and even though she's been portrayed by her club as an angry mother who would not hesitate to pull Taichi from her club if his grades slipped, here she [actually seems genuinely shocked](https://i.imgur.com/Bg1OOux.jpg) when Taichi mentions what he'd done, which highlights the love/hate coin mentioned earlier and raises the question on whether she ever had any intention of actually enforcing that.

---

**03:15** - ?? recites #48 (ka-ze-o). Tamaru wins it from Chihaya's upper right.  
**03:59** - Chihaya: ""I-I... I... was the rock. I was the rock, and I... c-crushed them into pieces. Taichi's feelings... all these years... All that time, I... I... ""  
**04:20** - Fukasaku: ""When the winds are at their strongest, the waves crash into the rocks, only to fall apart themselves. Just like those waves, my own heart is in danger of breaking apart, as I continue to pine endlessly for you.""  
**05:24** - Fukasaku: ""Learn something. It doesn't matter what. Just learn something.""

Tamaru Midori, the new Class A from the New Years' tournament, wins the episode card from Chihaya as Chihaya's cards blacken the way that Arata‚Äôs and Taichi's have this season. We know she quit the club at some point after this match (mid April) and before the May time skip at the Fujisaki camp, so it's a reasonable assumption to make that Tamaru ruthlessly brushing this card away from Chihaya symbolized to her that Taichi was out of her reach, and eventually contributed to her leaving the club.

Chihaya [bumps into Mr. Fukasaku](https://i.imgur.com/JTFRZVx.jpg) in a [very familiar hallway](https://i.imgur.com/pn9LnY1.jpg) -- not quite [the same one](https://i.imgur.com/cXIUKwU.jpg) where Kana and Chihaya [had their scene](https://i.imgur.com/dwzfAAZ.jpg) in S3E15, but probably just one floor down. While that scene took place after Arata's confession, this scene took place after Chihaya's one, and the difference in her reactions is stark and obvious.

There are all sorts of mild parallels between the two scenes -- Kana and Mr. Fukasaku both love classical Japanese literature, for example, and while the episode 15 scene had Kana and Chihaya talking about the white pigeons outside the window, and wondering if one was pregnant, here we see Mr. Fukasaki carrying books with [a little bud](https://i.imgur.com/8Hkpu6K.jpg) on them. Another interesting parallel is Chihaya's line about crushing Taichi's feelings to pieces, because after the Kana scene in S3E15 was the scene where the entire Mizusawa club was walking on an avenue of red leaves, and Sumire [had a line](https://i.imgur.com/KAV5X71.jpg) that went,

**S3E15 08:22** - Sumire: ""I'm wishing for someone who's trying so hard to have his heart crushed into bits.""

Yet, as it turns out, Sumire's wish coming true did not give her any better of a path to Taichi's heart either. Anyway, Mr. Fukasaku's line seems a bit weird at first, but essentially he's telling her to lose herself in something and in that, find a way to self-improve and move forward from there. He was shown to be in the room with Ms. Miyauchi and Mr. Koda at the start of the episode, and did hear what Mr. Koda had to say to her, so perhaps this was also counteracting that in a way, as he's demonstrating that just like love and hate are part of the same coin, so are teaching and learning -- and indirectly, he probably is agreeing with her decision to go on the Kyoto trip to gain experience from that.

**07:46** - Arata: ""I have people protecting me, helping me.""  
**09:19** - Yuu: ""What are you doing, Arata? And now, of all times?""  
**09:31** - Arata: ""I don't know. But right now... I feel like I have to build a team.""  
**10:40** - Arata: ""I have to gather the wind toward me. Like Chihaya and Taichi did. I can do this, too. This is Fukui, after all.""  
**17:41** - Sakurazawa: ""He's good enough to be considered the strongest high school player, but he's reverting to a beginner's perspective in order to play as a team. Why go that far to play in team matches? It's the Master match you should be working toward. Why?""

The episode then takes us through a short Taichi sequence where he meets Suou at his cram school, and then a segment where Arata finally manages to build his adorable karuta team. Yuu is the literal personification of last episode's ""Drifting boatsman"" episode card, #46 (yu-u), and her question is basically asking him if he too were drifting along now in the wrong direction by focussing on this instead of the master match. The question from her, and from Sakurazawa later on, is: Why?

There's no solid answer of course, it's a combination of wanting to have fun, wanting to leave a legacy to encourage the next generation to play, and wanting to learn the aspects of team karuta that you cannot learn in individual play, and to grow stronger in that way. There are silent parallels here with what Arata says, about how he has people protecting and helping him, and the necessary role that Taichi played in helping Chihaya get her team off the ground in the first place, with him directly recruiting Komano and teaching Komano and Kana the rules of the game. This plays into a conclusion we make near the end, that Taichi had always acted as Chihaya's protector and helper, the way that Arata feels here.

Lastly, Arata's line about gathering the wind and ""This is Fukui, after all."" utilizes a pun around the term ""the wind blows"" (""kaze wo fuku"" È¢®„ÇíÂêπ„Åè) and the ""fuku"" in Fukui. It's a different Kanji altogether, as Fukui is written as Á¶è‰∫ï, but that doesn't stop Arata's dad joke.

**11:15** - Sakurazawa: ""Welcome, Wataya-kun. We'll be sure (to) take a real close look at your game today.""  
**12:20** - Reader recites #09 (ha-na-no). Rion wins this from Arata's middle right. She passes #33 (hi-sa) from her middle left row, it goes to Arata's middle left row.  
**12:21** - Reader recites #91 (ki-ri). Rion wins this from Arata's lower right. She passes over the #40 (shi-no) from her lower right row, it goes to Arata's lower left row. 25-21 Rion.  
**12:53** - Reader recites #87 (mu). Rion wins it from her bottom left.  
**13:04** - Reader recites #47 (ya-e).  
**13:34** - Arata wins #31 (a-sa-bo-ra-ke-a) from his lower right corner against Hyuga.  
**16:10** - Rion wins #69 (a-ra-shi) from Arata's lower left. She sends #74 (u-ka).  

Most of the significant lines from here have been pulled out to other sections, and the rest of it is straightforward stuff with Arata trying to figure out what it means to play as a team, so this section is largely to map what happened during the Fujisaki games.

However, the fact that Fujioka East shows up at all, coupled with the knowledge that Hokuo also did the same, and [Makoto's words to Rion](https://i.imgur.com/HthHNIF.jpg) from S3E22, continue to cement Shizuoka and Fujisaki as a sort of middle ground between the East and the West where representatives from the two sides can go for impartial training, regardless of their affiliation. But just as much as the advisor was commenting on the types of connections that Arata has, it's Sakurazawa that really has the connections and the wiles to build bridges with all the other major schools, and turn her school's location into a resource not only for those other schools, but for her players as well. Her line about examining Arata's game at the start of this suggests that, tongue-in-cheek as it might be.

Anyway, Arata and his team play three games here, with Arata's first map board against Rion being mappable, as follows:

[Arata vs Rion Game 1 starting board (25-23 Arata)](https://i.imgur.com/vdheFKN.png)

Wait.. 25-23 starting board? Yes, it wouldn't be Madhouse without the occasional continuity error, and here we have a good one to close out the season -- for some reason, Rion starts the game with [only 23 cards](https://i.imgur.com/bPlTx3M.jpg) compared to [Arata's 25](https://i.imgur.com/5t0mAAP.jpg), and no one ever picks up on that or comments on it. It's part of Fujioka East being distracted and unsure how to play as a team, I guess, that they let their opponents even escape with things like that! The game even continues like that was normal, as Rion has 22 cards left after the #09, and 21 left after the #91. Also, both Arata and Rion mention some cards,

**12:23** - Arata: ""The two multi-syllable ""For you, I"" cards are still in play, but she didn't even hesitate.""  
**12:51** - Rion: ""Rain, Silent, Look, Swift, Feel sorrow, Would this, Would the, Since I, After I... ""

The first one, the ""For you, I"" cards that are [highlighted at 12:25](https://i.imgur.com/jStPTvQ.jpg), are the two ki-mi-ga-ta-me cards, in contrast to the #91 (ki-ri) card that Rion won pretty much before the second syllable. The second series, that Rion chants, are #87 (mu), #18 (su), #81 (ho), #77 (se), #23 (tsu-ki), #100 (mo-mo), #66 (mo-ro), #40 (shi-no), and then the first two syllables of #63 (i-ma-wa) or #21 (i-ma-ko), both of which she has on her board, side by side, so that's all she needs to win either of them.

This is interesting because the cards are all over the board, suggesting that she has a completely different way of memorizing and/or targetting cards than Chihaya or Taichi do. Taichi memorizes all the remaining cards in the box, and mentally ticks them off as they're read, Chihaya seems to memorize cards per row, whereas Rion here seems to be memorizing cards per syllable even if they're scattered around the board. This also might give a hint as to some of the cards that Rion considers to be one-syllable cards, even if they're normally two syllables, due to her good ""game sense,"" but they don't go into further detail here, so perhaps we can put a pin in this for future seasons.

Anyway, besides the cards, we also see what seems to be some of the new Fujisaki students in this segment, although they aren't introduced. We hear a couple names, Motoki, Kawashima, and Miyagawa, and [this lineup in particular](https://i.imgur.com/4RToiQ8.jpg) might be entirely mappable to names, using [this](https://i.imgur.com/HPjhm7s.jpg) to identify Kawashima and this [Genpei match](https://i.imgur.com/4EaApzV.jpg) screenshot plus looking at the Fujisaki names in the Genpei roster, and using a process of elimination to guess at Itose.

---

**20:25** - Fukasaku: ""She has more power than she knows what to do with.""

This refers to Kana's explanation of the #17 (chi-ha) card in S2E7:

**S2E7 16:20** - Kana: ""Frenzied refers to power used for wrong, while impassionate refers to power used for right.""  
**S2E7 16:33** - Kana: ""Frenzied would be used to describe a shaky, spinning top, while impassionate would refer to a top that spins perfectly smoothly.""

And this plays into how both Chihaya and Taichi are reeling after basically shipwrecking and pushing each other away. We see this specifically with the spinning wheels of hiragana for both the #46 (yu-ra) and #17 (chi-ha) poems, and there are two instances of it in this episode, one as [Taichi sees Suou](https://i.imgur.com/Z5pOrNK.jpg) at 06:23 and one at [20:16](https://i.imgur.com/7GvDSs3.jpg) as Chihaya studies some questionable things. We've seen those spinny wheels in the OPs for all three seasons as well, and they basically represent a twirling top, and the effect that both of them have on each other (#17 represents Chihaya, and #46 Taichi). Both of them at this point were not being able to move past the event at the end of the last episode despite trying to lose themselves in other things.

So, why did Chihaya chase after Taichi and dash herself against the rocks in vain to try to get him to stay? It is too bad that they seem to glaze over the reason that she herself left the club, as that would have probably given more of an insight into this. But for her, it probably would be due to a form of love -- probably not in the way that Taichi loved her, but more along the lines of a conflation of her love for karuta, and their childhood and high school memories, and the way they work well as a team together. That team theme was shown through the episode fairly openly with Arata creating the new Fujioka East team, and with Mizusawa welcoming their new members, and also highlighted with lines from various characters like,

**07:46** - Arata: ""I have people protecting me, helping me.""  
**09:43** - Arata: ""When my grandpa was still alive, you helped us out a lot, remember? To me, we were a team.""  
**14:21** - Sakurazawa: ""Mizusawa was a team with an extreme egoist and an extreme leader. I'm not that kid from Hokuo, but I wonder how Mizusawa will fare without the two of them.""

Even though Arata is currently Chihaya's ultimate goal, Taichi and Chihaya had always worked well together, and in many ways he had always acted as [Chihaya's protector](https://i.imgur.com/ZG3Ggru.jpg) (S1E23), to the point that even Arata felt he had to go through Taichi to speak to Chihaya at first. But this season has shown them [drifting apart](https://i.imgur.com/xa2bzqG.jpg) (S3E16) and leaving her without his protection. Instead, it's Arata, the person who is ""always so far away"" (19:18), that ends the season on a hopeful note by texting both Taichi and Chihaya a picture of his team like she did at the end of S1E11.

**13:21** - Arata: ""Is it true that they quit? I need to at least find that out for sure. If it's true, that would mean they're feeling really lost right now. Chihaya and Taichi both.""

Even as he spends a chunk of this episode trying to figure out how to best encourage his own Fujioka players, Arata's text message, and corresponding picture, seems to reach both of his own former childhood teammates loud and clear, and we see Chihaya's conflation of karuta and love as we jump from a Taichi flashback to an Arata one from her imagination.

**21:01** - Taichi (flashback): ""Arata will come back someday for sure. Let's get stronger and wait for his return.""  
**21:13** - Suou: ""What's wrong?""  
**21:15** - Taichi: ""Nothing. I'm coming.""  
**21:22** - Arata (imagined): ""Taichi will come back someday for sure. Let's get stronger and wait for his return.""

For the viewers, this of course suggests that Chihaya might be destined to return to her club at some point to help nurture the new players. It gives her a new motive to move forward toward her goals and to play again, a motive that her new homeroom teacher questioned at the start of the episode. Besides being a reply to Suou, Taichi's last words also serve as a reply to Arata's last words in Chihaya's mind.

And lastly, Chihaya and Arata's final words bookend a shot of Suou and Taichi talking to each other, in what certainly looks like [a certain karuta hall](https://i.imgur.com/aLWm3c2.jpg) (S3E15 14:59). For all that Arata's club advisor was shocked by his karuta connections, this suggests that despite all his losses, all that Taichi has done this season has not been in vain either, and he now also has personal connections that he can rely on to play karuta with if he so chooses, to fill the empty void inside him, and he even manages to drag his new teacher along to practice despite it being [out of season for Suou](https://i.imgur.com/LPWAvg6.jpg). After all, whether in medical school or in karuta, Mr. Fukasaku's advice still holds true!

**05:24** - Fukasaku: ""Learn something. It doesn't matter what. Just learn something.""

**Bonus**

I made a stats post for both the end of [Season 1](https://www.reddit.com/comments/awmzi0/tigey/ehnns26/) as well as [Season 2](https://www.reddit.com/comments/b6oa9w/tigey/ejlv78b/), so naturally here's one for Season 3 as well! The same disclaimer applies -- there are many cases where I had to make a call as to whether to count something or not, and any person making these will invariably have slightly different numbers from mine, as there are a lot of edge cases to consider.

As always, Table 1 is overall stats. This table counts only cards where I could actually see or calculate the exact card that was won. The reason for this is that otherwise you can just take all the final scores of a game and massively inflate the numbers anyway. This way, my aim is to actually dig for symbolism or fun stats among not only their total card wins but *which* cards they won, as well!

###Win/Loss Records

**Table 1 - Onscreen/Calculated Card Win/Loss records by player**

Name|S3 W|S3 L|S3 Win%|Total W|Total L|Win %
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
Chihaya|38|35|52.1|191|180|51.58
Taichi|26|19|57.78|83|66|55.70
Arata|31|39|44.29|46|52|46.94
Shinobu|10|12|45.45|62|22|73.81
Nishida|0|1|0.00|28|37|43.08
Kanade|0|0|0.00|26|26|50.00
Komano|0|1|0.00|22|29|43.14
Sumire|2|0|100.00|7|5|58.33
Tsukuba|0|0|0.00|9|17|34.62

Chihaya and Taichi actually both improved this season, steadily tugging their numbers up, whereas Arata and Shinobu, who both still won a lot of games, largely won them offscreen and thus don't really have the numbers to show for it. Arata was lacking data through the first two seasons as well, so this season was good for him just in terms of having more than double the number of cards than he had in the first two seasons combined. The rest of the Mizusawa team came off with next to no cards this season -- they were a combined 2-2, with both of the 2 wins coming from Sumire off of Chihaya in S3E2 (She actually won 3 cards there, but one was unknown.) Kana in particular went 0-0 this season, so her record that I pointed out in the S2 Stats post is still intact -- she's still 10-0 onscreen in poems by the 36 Immortals of Poetry ever since her first ever tournament (S1E10) where she lost two of them. And lastly, even though Taichi had the highest percentage among the main trio, he also had the lowest number of cards played by far, which is interesting.

---

###Best cards

**Table 2 - Chihaya - Most Wins**

Card|W|L|%
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
#17 (chi-ha)|10|3|76.9
#37 (shi-ra)|7|2|77.8
#87 (mu)|6|1|85.7
#22 (fu)|6|2|75.0
#40 (shi-no)|6|2|75.0
#71 (yu-u)|5|0|100.0
#81 (ho)|5|1|83.3
#88 (na-ni-wa-e)|5|1|83.3
#33 (hi-sa)|5|2|71.4
#74 (u-ka)|5|3|62.5

These are all the cards that Chihaya has been shown to win at least 5 times through the first 3 seasons. Chihaya was 3-2 on #22 (fu) through the first three seasons, but thanks to a strong 3-0 showing in S3, that card has finally jumped up to among her best onscreen cards as well. She's quietly also been really strong at the #71 card (defeating Arata's childhood friend.. I mean, winning yu-u), as it's one of five cards that she hasn't ever been shown to lose on-screen. Those five cards are as follows:

**Table 3 - Chihaya - No Losses**

Card|W|L
:--:|:--:|:--:
#71 (yu-u)|5|0
#09 (ha-na-no)|4|0
#89 (ta-ma)|3|0
#67 (ha-ru-no)|2|0
#84 (na-ga-ra)|2|0

There are also still three cards that she has a 0-0 record for, #39 (a-sa-ji), #58 (a-ri-ma), and #93 (yo-no-na-ka-wa).

Yet again, no other character has enough stats to make any sort of a reasonable table. Taichi is 4-1 on #17 (chi-ha), 4-2 on #43 (a-i), 3-1 on #57 (me), and 2 wins or less on everything else. For what it's worth, Arata is 0-2 on #17 (chi-ha) this season and overall -- he's never won the #17 card on screen, further playing into his thoughts in S3E23 about whether he would have been able to defend the card against Taichi.

###Syllable Lengths

Next, syllable breakdown by player. Does the show demonstrate them being better at short or long cards? Chihaya gets a ""1"" row for the 2-syllable cards that Komano claims she wins on the first syllable.

**Table 4 - Chihaya's Win-Loss per syllable**

Syllable|S3 W|S3 L|S3 %|Total W|Total L|Win %
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
1|6|2|75.0|24|12|66.7
""1""|9|6|60.0|45|28|61.6
2|10|10|50.0|50|52|49.0
3|9|12|42.9|51|62|45.1
4-6|4|5|44.4|21|26|44.7
Total|38|35|52.1|191|180|51.58

**Table 5 - Taichi's Win-Loss per syllable**

Syllable|S3 W|S3 L|S3 %|Total W|Total L|Win %
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
1|4|3|57.1|9|10|47.4
2|13|11|54.1|36|37|49.3
3|4|5|44.4|27|16|62.8
4-6|5|0|100.0|11|3|78.6
Total|26|19|57.78|83|66|55.7

**Table 6 - Arata's Win-Loss per syllable**

Syllable|S3 W|S3 L|S3 %|Total W|Total L|Win %
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
1|6|4|60.0|9|6|60.0
2|11|18|37.9|15|25|37.5
3|10|11|47.6|16|15|51.6
4-6|4|6|40.0|6|6|50.0
Total|31|39|44.29|46|52|46.94

Chihaya and Taichi's stats through both this season as well as overall tell the tale of their playstyles -- The shorter the card is, the better Chihaya does, whereas the worse Taichi does. Arata's probably somewhere in the middle, he has weird numbers but we would honestly need another season or two of samples before we can really see his curve normalize the way that Chihaya‚Äôs and Taichi's have after 3 seasons, since he's played so few cards. Also, I didn't realize Taichi went 5-0 on ""long cards"" this season, but apparently he did!

---

###Row Analysis

This came out of [Komano's quadrant analysis](https://i.imgur.com/8s38iot.jpg) in Season 1, where he said her weakest quadrants were B and C. We saw through the first two seasons that the show actually stays faithful to that. How did she fair this season? Has she improved?

**Table 7 - Chihaya's Row by Row Analysis**

Line|Quadrant|S1 W|S1 L|S1 %|S2 W|S2 L|S2 %|S3 W|S3 L|S3 %|Total W|Total L|Total %
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
Chihaya Top Right|A|4|5|44.4|3|5|37.5|1|0|100.0|8|10|44.4
Chihaya Mid Right|A|3|4|42.9|6|3|66.7|3|4|42.9|12|11|52.2
Chihaya Bot Right|A|7|9|43.8|2|8|20.0|6|1|85.8|15|18|45.5
Chihaya Top Left|B|2|4|33.3|2|6|25.0|2|0|100.0|6|10|37.5
Chihaya Mid Left|B|4|4|50.0|1|4|20.0|1|1|50.0|6|9|40.0
Chihaya Bot Left|B|2|8|20.0|5|10|33.3|6|5|54.5|13|23|36.1
Opponent Top Left|C|1|3|25.0|1|2|33.3|1|1|50.0|3|6|33.3
Opponent Mid Left|C|0|8|0.0|3|8|27.3|0|3|0.0|3|19|13.7
Opponent Bot Left|C|6|5|54.6|6|5|54.6|3|1|75.0|15|11|57.7
Opponent Top Right|D|2|2|50.0|4|4|50.0|2|6|25.0|8|12|40.0
Opponent Mid Right|D|6|8|42.9|7|2|77.8|0|5|0.0|13|15|46.4
Opponent Bot Right|D|11|9|55.0|15|6|71.4|5|8|38.5|31|23|57.4

**Table 8 - Chihaya's Quadrant Analysis**

Quadrant|S1 W|S1 L|S1 %|S2 W|S2 L|S2 %|Total W|Total L|Total %
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
A|14|18|43.75|11|16|40.74|10|5|66.7|35|39|47.3
B|8|16|33.33|8|20|28.57|9|6|60.0|25|42|37.3
C|7|16|30.43|10|15|40.00|4|5|44.4|21|36|36.8
D|19|19|50.00|26|12|68.42|7|19|26.9|52|50|51.0

Phew, what a handful. Her quadrant strength coming into this season was D &gt; A &gt; C &gt; B, but this season it shifted to A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D instead, showing an interesting skew and concentration toward defensive karuta this season! There were less cards for Chihaya this season across the board due to half the season being dedicated toward other players, but she still had the most resolved cards in Quadrant D, so it's surprising to see such a nosedive there.

Perhaps due to her injury and recovery, perhaps due to her training and understanding the game more, it's hard to say exactly why, but it sure looked like her top and bottom quadrants, B and D, did a complete flip this season, as though she were specifically concentrating on shoring up her weak points. It didn't change the overall quadrant strength much though, as overall it still goes D &gt; A &gt; B &gt; C. By dropping her strongest quadrant, she actually managed to pull up the percentages of her other three.

###Most recited cards

Lastly is the number of cards recited. We had 356 cards read in S1, 285 in S2, and only 205 in S3 -- a very strange drop, and one can attempt to read things into that if they like. On the bright side, if this continues, S5 will be very easy to draw and map for! I used the same disclaimer as I did in the S2 post, so here: ""I didn't count flashbacks to a recital we had already counted, nor cards/poems that were just being named.""

Two cards were read five times this season - #17 (chi-ha) and #87 (mu). Eleven cards were recited 4 times. Naniwa Bay had 20 recitals, more than in S2, bringing its 3-season total up to 69. Across the 3 seasons, the most recited cards have been:

**Table 9 - Card recitation count**

Card|Occurrences
:--:|:--:
Naniwa Bay|69
#17 (chi-ha)|24
#37 (shi-ra)|17
#87 (mu)|17
#40 (shi-no)|16
#77 (se)|15
#57 (me)|14
#81 (ho)|14
#43 (a-i)|13
#51 (ka-ku)|13
#22 (fu)|12
#23 (tsu-ki)|12

The top few at least are fairly obvious - Chihaya card, Shiranami Society card, Shinobu card, then a bunch of one-syllable cards, with Suetsugu's favourite card (#43) in the mix too.

On the flip side, #45 (a-wa-re) continues its cold shoulder, as it's only been recited once through three seasons -- do some poems have licensing issues or something?? -- Kyouko recited it at 3:04 of S2E17. One card has been read twice - #53 (na-ge-ki), then five cards at a count of 3.

Anybody else want to see any specific stats? Oh, here's [my master spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y6Rf2CbTow0Gkgidv2NSBbKUWIiYjhSQ0zmWNySTKoE/edit#gid=0).

Thank you for following along, and see you for season 4, maybe!

fouoni,iPhantomGuy,Looking for a series,"All I can remember is that a character, probably the main character, had a flashback. We see that his family was poor growing up. He lives together with his mom and little sibling(I believe it's a sister). We see that the mother is literally starving herself to keep the children alive, but the character we focus on keeps demanding more food. Eventually, we see a moment where the mom splits a piece of food between the two children. The character eats the food, notices he wants more, and steals the food from his sibling while the mom isn't looking. The mom looks back when the child starts to cry, after which the character runs away. The mom doesn't chase him I believe. After that moment, I believe the character never sees his family again. This is all I remember, hope it helps.",6,1585158524,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fouoni/looking_for_a_series/,anime,1
foungj,Samkwi,What is your opinion on Harmony (movie),"Felt that it started out strong with its premise and location the first anime that I've watched to feature Africa (even though it's only at the beginning) the plot was way more interesting when it started but towards the mid-section it felt like it lost most of its tension and focused to much on action. It lost a lot of its horror when everything was basically revealed to early, and the protagonist kept the movie going as she was the best part of the movie.

 The 3D tech used used felt uncanny on certain scenes they perfectly mimic 2D tech but at other certain scenes the 3D part of it was more noticible. I believe the tech got better as the movie went on.

Anyway what are your opinions on the movie",3,1585158411,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/foungj/what_is_your_opinion_on_harmony_movie/,anime,1

fou109,TrashSociologist,"In regards to the ""700-year-old loli"" trope.","I understand that a lot of it is geared toward fanservice, but I am not here to debate the morals of that today. Lots of people already have that discussion elsewhere. Instead, I want to discuss why I think the trope has so much potential outside of fanservice that is often squandered. I want to base my argument on two character studies. Minor spoilers for ""Fire Emblem Fates"" and major spoilers for ""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"" follow.

First up, we have Nyx. Much of my thoughts on Nyx can be related to Faerghast on Youtube has to say on her character, but here I summarize and expand on the relevant points. She is implied to be a much older woman (could be anywhere from her 50's to her 70's) to the point that she actually treats others like children. She very much acts her age unlike many 1,000-year lolis who either act the age they look, or act like how a child would pretend to be an adult. And while many initially perceive her as a child, that isn't the focus of her struggles. This makes her more well rounded, but it also relates to one of her struggles that is less explicitly explored: Nyx's desire for romance. She is a lonely old woman who wants love and sex just like most others, to the point she reads raunchy literature. The thought of having the desire for sex, but being physically unable to have your desires taken seriously by those you desire, or having to worry about those that are attracted to you being pedophiles sounds like an absolute nightmare and has a lot of potential, but it is barely touched on. In Corrin's S-support, she also worries that as Corrin ages, the woman he has beside her will not, and will still resemble a young girl. In other words, not only can she not grow old with him, but she worries that the man she loves will be mistaken as a pedophile and ostracized by those around them. The authors wanted to explore other themes with her, and I respect that, but I feel that many other anime and games could explore this in more depth for great drama.

Next, for Higurashi, we have [Spoiler](/s ""Furude Rika. Rika, having lived through the same month long loop hundreds of times is typically considered to be around 110-years-old mentally. She is a grown woman trapped in a little girl's body. Unable to be taken seriously. Constantly having to put on a tiring mask of being an innocent child for a century. So draining and PTSD filled that she is literally driven to drinking on several occasions just to quell the horrors in her head."") I think Higurashi handled this masterfully, and wish more series went this route.

So, what do you think? Would you like to see the trope examined in other ways? Are you tired of it altogether? Does the drama sound too forced and you're just in it for the fanservice? Let me know.",24,1585156313,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fou109/in_regards_to_the_700yearold_loli_trope/,anime,1

fotlu9,Echoing_Void,Anyone got any good anime suggestions for me??,"Ok so I'm kinda more into anime than most people but I'm still kinda new and want some recommendations. How I'm gonna do this is I'm gonna list all the anime I've watched and my opinions on them. Then I'd like you to try and give me some reccomendations. I've also read some mangas but they are only ones which link to anime I watch and I will add them to my description of each anime.

 Vanguard/Buddyfight (watched all series apart from vanguard reboot.): I originally watched these two serieses as my first animes before I knew what anime was and I enjoyed them but then put them down. Recently starting of with anime again I picked these two back up and icl the og vanguard was bs especially Aichi he was just a bad protagonist, vanguard g was really good imo but they screwed the reboot up so bad and I gave up on it all together. As for Buddyfight it's pretty good imo especially as GAO is imo one of the best op characters done right. Ace is just not as good tho.

 Full dragon Ball series (watched all of it): this was the series that got me back into anime and I really enjoyed it. One of my favourite animes still to this day (not including gt). It is inevitable me not picking up the manga for dbs as there seems to be no clear signs of season anywhere in the near future.

Naruto (watched full series and boruto will be listed seperately): after I finished dB I was curious on what to watch, I got into crunchyroll and started watching this. I really liked it along with dragon ball.

Hunter x hunter (watched the full series): I really liked this series but I did feel it was a bit rushed towards the end. Did think about picking up the manga but didn't in the end.

Sao: I really liked the og series upto the end when they made kirito an absolute god and then it went downhill from there until the start of alicization and I am currently awaiting alicization part 2 and so far am really liking it again. Wanted to pick up the light novels but I don't have that much money so I cant buy them and there don't seem to be anywhere to read them legally or illegally unlike manga.

Dr. Stone (seen all of s1): alot of people said I would like it and it was alright but it really just wasn't my thing.

Radiant (watched all of s1&amp;2 and am reading along with the manga): s1 was a mess of filler. S2 was not as bad but still wasn't that good. Manga is pretty good but it is very slow as in 100 chapters since 2013 (I believe don't quote me on that just around there somewhere.)

Re:zero (watched s1): really liked the concept of this show kinda annoyed S2 got pushed back but I really like the actual concept of it and stuff. Wanted to pick up the light novels but... You know.

Seven deadly sins (watched s1,2&amp;3): really cool series was a bit disappointed in s3 and am awaiting season 4 tho.

One punch man: kinda the same situation as Dr. Stone idk why tho.

Aot (seen s1,2&amp;3 and am reading along with the manga): the last series I finished really liked it started reading the manga aswell and at this point am just waiting for S4.

Haikyuu (watched s1,2,3 and am currently watching along with 4.): Idk what it is about this anime cause it ain't light hearted but like it's something I can watch to the side.

My hero Acadameia (watched s1,2,3 and am watching along with 4. Also reading along with the manga): just another cool anime and am into the manga aswell.

Black clover (watching along with the anime and reading along with the manga): I really really like this series idk why kinda not annoyed but frustrated that am not going to be able to see an ending to this anytime soon as the director wants it to be as long as one piece.

Boruto (watching and reading along): originally anime was pretty bad as there was too much filler but since like the start of the hozuki prison arc it's been getting better. As for the manga there is nothing to say other than it has been turned to 12.

Anime I am considering

Demon slayer: interested probably the next thing I'm gonna watch and maybe pick up the manga

Blue exorcist: looks like something I'd watch that's all tbh

One piece: I really want to get into this as it gives of the same Naruto/dB vibes but it's just too long and I feel like I'm going to get too deeply invested and just binge for months on end.

Solo levelling: I've heard really great things about it and I might pick it up as my first standalone manga as apparently it has no anime adaptation.

Animes I don't want to watch or gave up on

JoJo: watched a bit and for some reason I really disliked it and ended up giving up on it.

Food wars: I've had people reccomend this to me before but it just don't seem to be my kind of thing.

Anyways in the end that's about it can someone give me some reccomendations as I feel like I'm going to have Alot of time to binge due to the recen events around the world. Thanks",16,1585154913,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fotlu9/anyone_got_any_good_anime_suggestions_for_me/,anime,1

fotjag,incomingwristrockets,Recommendations?,"So, recently I decided that I would try watching anime. For a while I had been skeptical of it but I finally  gave into the pressure (mainly put on me by a few friends) and decided to give it a try. I really liked it. I watched the first two parts of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (I am planning on seeing the others as well) and also Neon Genesis Evangelion and enjoyed them both a lot (and for those wondering I watched the subtitles version). 

I was wondering what the people of r/anime recommend I do next. I really liked the ones I watched and I want to watch more! Since I am new to anime I don't really have a good idea of all the series that are out there or where to find them. I decided to come here to seek some recommendations. So, what are your favorite anime series and what should I give a try?

### **Episode 12:**
## ***A Flash of Sloth &amp; Nefarious Sloth***

---

### | [Index](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ehosfl/rezero_starting_life_in_another_world_rewatch_20/) | &lt;== [Episode 11](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fkqdtv/rezero_starting_life_in_another_world_directors/) | [Episode 13] ==&gt; |

---

### What is the ""Director's Cut""?

The Director's Cut is a new broadcast of the original release of Re:Zero back in 2016. It is the same story, told is 13 one hour episodes, which are being released weekly. This is the 'remake' that was announced a month ago.

What is interesting about it is that new content that was cut from the original release will be ***potentially*** added in along the way. It may be minor edits or major additions that have plot importance for when the Second Season airs.

### Regarding Spoilers
 
This is going to be a rewatch for many people, but also a first time experience for some users. Because of that, **please keep any future episode spoilers within the subreddit's spoiler tag feature.** View the sidebar to see how they work.
 
Additionally, I would like to ask that spoilers be limited to the **anime adaption only**. Anything past that, including the Light Novel or Web Novel, is ***absolutely not permitted*** during this Re:Watch.

With the rebroadcast including new scenes/ content not present in the original release, please avoid discussing what the new material will be until it is shown.
 
Keep in mind: ***No one likes being spoiled.***

for7y0,whotsop,Good series with bad/mediocre openings and bad/mediocre series with good openings,"What are examples of these two types of series in your opinion?

For the first category, I‚Äôd have to say that Code Geass could have used some better openings. Opening 1 is iconic (JIBUN WO~), and opening 3 is okay, but opening 2 is terrible and opening 4 is forgettable imo. Trigun would be another example. The song is great, but the majority of the visuals are a lazily slapped together montage of segments from the episodes (perhaps due to budget constraints?)

For the second category, my prime example would be Another. I absolutely love the opening, but the series was hard to take seriously as a horror series due to the borderline comedic ways in which several characters died, and I also had issues with the writing. Another example is Elfen Lied. The opening is stunning both musically and visually, but the series itself was trying way too hard to be edgy and deep without actually saying anything of substance, imo, and there were too many conveniences surrounding how the characters were able to interact in the ways that they did.",7,1585146556,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/for7y0/good_series_with_badmediocre_openings_and/,anime,1

However, I somehow wanna give in to this bittersweet feeling and therefore I'm looking for anime that has some of the following characteristics:



- school anime, boy has a crush on girl, watches her during class etc

- doesn't know how to approach her

- MC is NOT short in height, because I can't identify with that (almost 2m tall)

- romance or bonding should be the core of the show, so preferably no fantasy world with dramatic action, more like something bittersweet to watch that takes you far away but still hits home




I already read about Toradora, but the idea that the main characters help each other to meet other people (as far as I understood it) isn't really my cup of tea. I want something that revolves around two people but isn't too corny or romantic.


So some humor is welcome :)



I also read about Suzuka and Golden Time but don't feel sure about them either.


This may sound stupid, but it would be somewhat cool if the main girl was blonde or at least light hair and freckles..:D because, obviously, this is what my crush looks like :D

foq2f9,LesTerribles,[WT!] Kappa no Coo to Natsuyasumi - Summery goodness for these quarantine days,"Summer Days with Coo is quite an overlooked movie, coming in at #4187 on MAL. No one today really GAF about it, imo. Yet, I was drawn to this movie without really knowing why. Perhaps it was the lively summer aesthetic or just the novelty of watching something niche. As I watched the movie, its quality and its appeal became abundantly clear.

The movie follows a family of 4 (and their dog). The son of the family discovers an irregular rock, which turns out to be the fossil of a Kappa, a mythical Japanese creature.

This movie is quaint - in the best possible way. It transports you to a world much less complicated. The aesthetic captures a world from 15 years past; a world which isn't more benevolent than ours, but is free of the pervasive feeling of malice and doubt of our times. I especially liked it given the trying times that we live in right now. It isn't trying to create a comfy atmosphere yet it has a pleasant earthy and summery feeling which I cannot capture in words. The first half of the movie has a greatly soothing quality.

The story really surprised me. It went completely besides my expectations yet kept me interested. I had expected an ET ripoff, not a story about an eloquent, lovable creature finding his place in a world that has outgrown his kind. I fully expected the Government to barge in into their home and abduct the Kappa. 

The movie goes in a different direction and somehow gets you to empathize with a talking bipedal frog-like mythical creature. The dynamics between the young kids and between the young boy and his kappa friend are so precious. The story tension does droop slightly in the middle, but it picks up towards the end making for a satisfying finish.

**YOU WILL LIKE THIS IF:**
* You like the quintessential warm, mid-2000s anime aesthetic
* You like Ghibli's grounded works like Only Yesterday
* You appreciate that there's more to a movie than it's MAL rating [7.57]

I later discovered why I was drawn to this movie from the get-go. It's directed by Keiichi Hara, director of Colorful, my second favourite anime movie. He's also directed Miss Hokusai (on the sidebar rn) and Shin-Chan.

Thus, I recommend you watch this.

foq1wg,Steve717,"Anime idea: The young son of the worlds greatest hero unlocks a dangerous power to try become strong but becomes progressively more jaded along the way, eventually becoming the villain","This is something I've been playing out in my head for years to pass the time, so I'm not going to go in to every detail. Just kinda want to vent it out and see what people think.

Thematically the series would take notes from Hunter x Hunter(light spoilers btw), Berserk and Naruto.

Firstly the boring setup of the power system, basically in this series there's two types of abilities that run alongside a typical Chi/chakra/magic/whatever system

One is basically a random mutation people unlock when under extreme stress, provided it lies within them. These can be consistent among bloodlines with slight variation, they're not understood beyond that.

Mutations like being able to become intangible, to increase ones size, control gravity, almost anything a writer wants really.


The other ability is one anyone can create using the power of their soul, this works a lot like in Hunter x Hunter where you can basically manifest what you want if you're powerful and skilled enough. These can range from body alterations to forming weapons and armour, these have a lot less range than mutations but everyone can create them and with that they can easily make one that compliments their other abilities.

Now for the progression of the story.


The world would be as you expect from a shounen, lots of powerful individuals in countries forming groups, armies, fighting for good or for evil etc etc

As the son of the current most powerful hero in his/her country and the world the main character has a lot to live up to, they're naturally tough but through having a much easier life don't progress quite as fast.

Which leads to a radical decision.

The main character decides to create an immensely powerful Soul ability.

This is where they start going downhill, with increasing speed as the story progresses.


This ability allows them to transform and unlock their maximum potential, the most strength they could possibly have achieved in life from the point they are at. Effectively the same as Gon's transformation in HxH. 

In order to do this they set various conditions that have to apply, the most extreme being that their lifespan is cut in half. Basically everything in their base form is limited by 50%.

And in their ultimate form aside from their ultimate level of power everything is increased by 50%, including pain as well as emotions...such as anger and hatred(you can see where that would go)

Other important conditions are:

1. They can't transform for as long as they were previously i.e transform for an hour can't do it for an hour
2. Being knocked unconscious breaks it
3. They can't gain strength while transformed, all gains must be made in the now limited base form



The character uses this ability as an alter ego, hiding it from everyone and creating a costume for it. They dub it ""The Ultimate""

By day they train to be part of the military forces, by night they fight crime.

This is getting kinda long and most likely nobody will read it anyway so will lay it out faster. There's a lot more detail in my head.

Basically the MC slowly sees more and more how messed up the world is and with those 50% stronger emotions they become ever more hateful of the world and realize how corrupt the powerful are, vowing to kill all powerful people. Along the way they unlock their mutation, Stack. Allowing them to stack 3-4 attacks on a target and at that third or fourth hit unleash a massively more powerful attack, which can be anything, even a finger prod.

So essentially they can attack someone with enough force to level a building but make it do absolutely no damage, pat the person a couple of times and then finally unleash all the damage at any moment, without the person ever realizing the intent.

They use this power in combat but also as an assassination tool since if you compress all the damage in to a mere finger poke it becomes a penetrating attack, allowing them to kill strong characters.


Eventually The Ultimate gains a kind of cult following of like minded people, all of whom are prepared to die for this cause to the point where they allow the MC to stack a lethal amount of damage on them to show their loyalty.


Haven't really decided on what the ending would be but this is the general progress of the story, obviously it gets darker and darker as this kid completely loses who they are or...were they always doomed to be this warped?

Two basic ending ideas involve the MC basically winning, killing even their father and mother and resetting the power scale in the world with the hope things are better moving forward.

Or their mother manages to defeat them because they held back on her. Unlike in most series the MC's mother is just as powerful as their father, in some ways more powerful. Essentially her mutation allows her to produce acid that gets stronger the longer it's in contact with her body, so if she makes a whip say, it can get to the point of cutting through basically anything. Or it can be used as a gas to melt people from within, overall pretty overpowered.

I think the first ending is better, the MC claiming victory at massive personal cost. They drink poison to end their life as the camera zooms out showing all the cult members having been executed.




Anyway yeah, that's a story I'd love to see in an anime/manga but I personally don't have the patience to actually write one with an interesting world and cast of characters attached. This actually just part of an ongoing freaking space opera or whatever in my head, I think it's the most interesting storyline anyway.",12,1585141988,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/foq1wg/anime_idea_the_young_son_of_the_worlds_greatest/,anime,1

So Kira in the anime is reluctant in intervening in battles but he and Lacus in Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2 is trying to stop wars by joining in three-way battles (like the one between AEUG and the Titans), and attacking and disarming both sides, yelling ‚ÄúStop Fighting!!!‚Äù, pushing his and Lacus‚Äô beliefs believing it will end the war . Now THAT is **foolish sentiment** and I think Kira went out of character in that game.

In my opinion, if he is reluctant in fighting battles based on foolish sentiment, if he knows the consequences of this approach with the aim to end battles and IF he really wants to protect his friends and loved ones as it is a part of his character, there is no DAMN way he would endanger himself and the said people TO THAT EXTENT by drawing the negative attention and the attacks of not just the whole ZAFT and not just the whole Alliance both in the anime and the crossover games, but any other whole armies/ groups (such as AEUG, and the Titans) that were fighting each other in the crossover games that Kira, Lacus and the Archangel was in, using the said approach in those battles. That is why in my point of view, Kira went out of character in those games.

fomsto,deadghost316,"Misunderstanding, the anime","I want to emphasis; I'm not talking about the type where the protagonist gets the shit beaten out of because he accidentally touches someone's breasts, or walks into the wrong locker room as if that will justify his abuse.

I'm talking about the ones where one person, despite being the other way, the others around him portray him in a different light, with ends up in wacky shenanigans and over the top outcomes.

Some of the best examples would be Angel Densetsu, where a kind and selfless boy is misunderstood for an evil delinquent because he has a scary face.

Iruma-Kun, a human in the demon world, tries not to stand out but ends up being a star attraction unintentionally.

Handa-Kun, an anti-social boy believes the school hates him when in reality he's the most popular kid, and everyone respects him.

And Detroit Metal City, the lead singer of a death metal band is worshipped, but under the mask, he's a soft-spoken, peace-loving kid.

As you can see, none of these examples takes themselves seriously, and that's my aim. The wackier the misadventure, the better.",9,1585124967,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fomsto/misunderstanding_the_anime/,anime,1

fojvz9,holomikasataiga,"Finally watched Madoka, here are some thoughts I have","So in light of social distancing and having jack shit to do, I finally decided to pick Puella Magi Madoka Magica and give it a try. After years of seeing the hype around this franchise, I went in with as reasonable expectations as I could muster, given the craze. Now having finished all 12 episodes, I thought I'd share some of my thoughts in case any of you Madoka fans are bored shitless like me.

As a heads up, no I haven't watched Rebellion yet. I plan on doing so, but I binged the entire show in one sitting today and I'm taking a break.

**What I liked**

Animation: Going into the show knowing the series was made by Shaft, I had pretty high expectations for the animation, and I'm proud to say that Shaft killed it. The action sequences were thrilling, kinetic, and fluid. Homura vs. The Walpurgis Night in particular had me laughing my ass off in awe of what was happening.

Art style: Similar to what I mentioned above, my experience with Shaft's other work assured me that they would bring their A game in the aesthetic department, and boy oh boy. Everytime a witch was on screen, it was absolutely beautiful. Mixing traditional japanese animation with the stop motion animation for the witches worked extremely well. However, what stood out just as much was the amazing use of color throughout the show. The final scene with Madoka and Homura in space (?) was so colorful and ethereal.

Homura: I assume this a popular choice for favorite character, but Homura seriously was badass. Her backstory in episode 10 explained her actions and motivations quite well, and by the end of the episode I felt sorry for her. Also, her riding that fuel tanker off the truss of a bridge into that witch was so stupid and I loved it.

**What I disliked**

Kyouko: To be completely honest, I have no clue what the purpose of her character was. Outside of sacrificing herself to stop Sayaka, I feel like she had little to no effect on the plot? I could imagine that you remove her from the picture and basically end up with the same story. Also, her going from self-centered psycho who was willing to kill Sayako for the hell of it, to laying down her life for Sayako in span of 3 episodes was really unbelievable to me. I might have missed it, but I saw no development in her character warranting such a change in heart.

Sayaka: Sayaka was by far my least favorite aspect of the show. I can only tolerate so much of the classic McCoy trope that shows up a lot in anime, and unfortunately Sayaka was a bit too much for my tastes. I get it, she's bent on being a pure magical girl, reminiscent of a certain headless friend of hers, but is that it? With Homura we're given a clear reason to her motivations, and due to this her behavior can be understood- she's three dimensional. But with Sayaka, her entire character boils down to rejecting Homura and Kyouko's ideology, but why? What caused that determination in her? Ultimately, her character feels so one dimensional. 


**Conclusion**


I'd say Madoka was a solid show with a interesting plot and great production values. However, I didn't care much for Kyouko or Sayaka, and I think the middle of the show rushed, and subsequently floundered, the development of both of their characters.

Now I'm 18yrs old waiting for s3. I kind of grew up with these characters. I was in middle school and I remember they seemed like a bunch of angsty teens then. It's so weird now that I'm in college and I can truly view at how young these characters actually are. It's just an interesting perspective now that I'm older.

[The_Draigg](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Draigg) discusses the enemy‚Äôs plan.

&gt; You have to admit, this plan of Butcher‚Äôs is both cruel and efficient. It‚Äôs a hard choice for the Jin family: either leave the stranded people out on the ocean to maybe die, or risk taking a human bomb onto their ship. As if you thought that Butcher couldn‚Äôt be more absurdly cruel, he once again comes up with a massive scumbag move.

&amp;nbsp;

**Daily Trivia:**

&gt; Yoshiyuki Tomino, who entered the production midway into planning, decided upon shaping Zambot 3 as he did because he felt the super robot genre was growing stale at the time.

fof3gv,KyleR9173,Why are Yorknew and The Chimera Ant arcs so worshipped?,"Yorknew is nearly 2 decades old at this point and Kurapika's story will never be completed in Togashi's lifetime. And maybe I'm the only one but nearly every member of the Phantom Troupe is laughably bad with the exception of Chrollo. I just don't see anything special about it compared to other great shounen arcs.

And there's no arc I see as more overly praised than the chimera ant arc. From the very second they introduce an ant my first thought was that they'll evolve to be human like, and everything up to that point is just waiting for the inevitable to happen. From the second Meruem and the girl are introduced it's 100% clear exactly where the series is ending. 

I'm not having, I'm just saying that the arc seems to be about 3 times as long as necessary and I really don't see Meruem or any of his single minded uninteresting underlings as good villains.

fod06x,kichu200211,I've got a question about Kyoukai no Kanata and Mirai-hen,"Is Mirai actually dead or not?

I've seen some people seem to theorize that she's just an illusion, created by Aki who has greater power over the KnK. But other characters interact with her and she didn't disappear when Akihito distanced himself from her or anything. She still eats like crazy and has all her powers and doesn't seem fake or anything. There's also the end credits scene from Mirai-hen as well.

Overall, *I* personally don't find it convincing that she is dead. Could someone help me?

I cried as I dealt a lot with suicidal feelings when I was younger. Any recommendations  for similar TV shows or movies. I find the tearjerker shows and movies have the best stories. The only thing is I still struggle with depression a lot so when I watch or read something sad where the ending isn't happy it throws me into a depression loop even though the story was amazing and brought out so much emotion in me. Any recommendations where the ending is actually happy?,14,1585083011,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/focw7s/good_movies_or_tv_shows_that_are_tear_jerkers_but/,anime,0

A friend of mine told me about an anime she saw around 2010-2012 on Youtube (could be both a series or a movie) that she can't seem to find no matter what. So i thought why not ask Reddit, who could maybe help us out.

Here is a little description that she gave me:

In the first scene, there was a high school boy, he was with his friends, there might've been one female friend among them. They were all at the pool, and they were playing some kind of ball game in the water. I remember the ball going crazy and I think there were lights flashing or an explosion underwater. I think it‚Äôs the first time he noticed he had powers (don't remember what kind of powers). I also remember the main bad guy, he had silver/blonde hair, he likes to fool around with a nurse, a nurse that wants him real bad. There is also a lesbian character, and there were sex scenes involving her, behind those traditional japanese paper doors, y'all know what i mean.

This might be a weird and vague description, but this was a long time ago after all. If any of you have a clue what it could be, let me know, and thanks in advance for any answers :)",2,1585080530,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/foc4uy/looking_for_a_certain_anime_seriesmovie/,anime,2

Wouldn't it be cool?

foav41,jawsome274,"Please, tell me what you mean by ""mainstream anime"" when asking for reccomendations.","Mainstream isn't black or white, yet when I see people asking for reccomendations, they say things like:

""I've seen everything that's mainstream at this point lol""

""Nothing mainstream please""

Please, PLEASE tell me what you mean by mainstream. You may say ""Oh, but mainstream just means popular, I don't see the problem,"" but HOW popular, and WHY is it popular are my questions. I've decided to cut up the different types of ""mainstream"" you could mean. At first I'll be going down different levels of popularity, then I'll branch out a bit for different cases that can be added to to other definitions.

Mainstream definition number 1: Everyone and their grandma knows it.

This is likely not what you mean, but I'll include it anyway. These are the anime that people might not even know are anime. I'm talking about the stuff so popular that if you show somebody it, they'll definitely know it. Pokemon perfectly fits the definition, alongside Beyblade, and maaaaaayyyyyybe DBZ.

Mainstream definition number 2: Popular among pop culture.

This I can see new anime fans using as their definition of mainstream. This includes ""The Big 3"" (Naruto, One Piece, Bleach), Fairy Tail, MHA, and a few others like AOT. However most anime fans who've been into the medium for a while would likely not use this as their definition.

Mainstream definition number 3: Popular among the shonen fandom.

I'll be including this on my ""Popularity hierarchy"" just because the vast majority of the most popular anime are shonen. This includes slightly less popular stuff like FMA, (and Brotherhood) Black Clover, HXH, and the original Dragonball/Super.

Mainstream definition number 4: Popular among the anime community.

This is probably what you mean if you aren't a shonen fan, or at least not completely. Violet Evergarden, Eizouken,  (sorry if I misspelled it) K-On!, and other shows that are popular among anime fandoms/sites like this one.

Additional mainstream definition number 1: Popular due to currently airing.

This doesn't really work alone, generally it's combined with other definitions. For example, people used to go crazy about stuff like Dr. Stone and Fire Force, but now I almost never see it, because the *shows stopped airing.* Of course, depending on your definition of mainstream, it may still be there, but it used to be even higher up. So if you've seen a lot of currently airing shows from a season or 2 ago, just say so.

Additional Mainstream definition number 2: Popular due to a high score.

This also doesn't work alone. This one goes without saying. Obviously shows with critical praise will be high up on the charts on sites where you can rank anime like MyAnimeList will be popular, although their spot on the 1-4 definitions may vary. This includes stuff like Gurren Lagann and Gintama.

If anybody has any other definitions, I'm all ears. But until then, please say exactly what you mean when you say something like ""I've seen most mainstream shows."" Instead, say ""I've seen most shows talked about on here, and most stuff that was airing 2 or 3 years ago"" or ""I've watched lots of shonen, and shows that I see at the top of ratings.""",17,1585076405,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/foav41/please_tell_me_what_you_mean_by_mainstream_anime/,anime,1

I saw an anime movie some months back on netflix or something and I cant find it. Hoping someone knows what I'm talking about.
Dont remember it too well, but i liked it and want to rewatch it. Hopefully someone can tell me the name.

A small group of (colorful) werewolves come to a village, where the local lord promptly puts a bounty on their heads and displays collected heads in town. (They're not true werewolves, but cant think of better desciptor)
Main character, a girl, befriends the leader of the werewolves. Leader of werewolves attacks Lord in revenge.

I've never seen anything about pirates in any medium besides the movie pirates of the Caribbean.

It sucks because you can always find something about ninja, samurai, fairies, but pirates are never represented anywhere and their cool af lol. If there are other series about pirates please list down below also. I would prefer it to be anime because I like watching anime and watching an anime revolved around pirates would be freaking awesome

Really love it but kinda disappointed when it ended (not talking about Boruto tho) because there's so many characters that was just 1 dimensional and was just there. Just recently I watched the anime. I didn't realize there's so many side characters that got explored. I ended up watching the entire Great Ninja War arc. There are times where I was frustrated because of too many flashbacks but I'm glad I get to know more about the characters than what I read in the manga. 

For example, Yamato, I never knew he has such a deep relationship with Kakashi. In the manga he didn't get too many screen time.

Often times the anime only adapts a fraction of the manga bu Naruto did the opposite. What other example of this?",10,1585065330,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fo7fjs/an_anime_that_explores_and_expand_deeper_than_the/,anime,1

My intention is not to insult or belittle anyone, and I merely wish to express a rarely seen opinion in this fandom, and show other Part 1/Jonathan fans that, hey, you arent alone! That said, please enjoy the post. TLDR at the very bottom of this post.**

**As the top of this post explains, there WILL be spoilers...to a decades old manga, yes, but spoilers, as it has a modern adaptation and is still popular regardless.**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Section 1:Why I LOVE Part 1\]**

Part 1 is a serious dramatic tale of two brothers, Jonathan and his adopted brother Dio Brando, and how the latter tries to inherit the Joestar Fortune through heinous means, before discovering the might of the Stone Mask. Jonathan trains in the art of Hamon and is joined by a short but sweet cast of characters from Zeppeli and Speedwagon, to Dire, Straizo, and Tonpetty, among a few other side people they pick up along the way. It's often denounced as boring or bland or tedious, but I say nuts to that! This part thrives on something that I think is commonly unappreciated, simplicity. Part 1 is simple, and sweet. It never needed to be the long road trip that Part 3 was, or the wacky railroad that Part 2 was, because those stories were MEANT to be that way, like how Part 4 is MEANT to be a close knit and contained story and why Part 5 is meant to resemble various mafia films akin to the Godfather. The fact that Part 1 is shit on for doing what it was meant to is...odd, but we'll get back to that later.

Part 1 was dark, scary, Dio was actually horrifying and complex, and while hes TECHNICALLY more dangerous in Part 3 due to his time stop ability, he really freaked me out with just how dastardly and evil he was in Part 1, especially during the ending. Part 1, to me, is my favorite because its a story that simply appeals to me more, I dont need the modern day reliance on crack brained acid trip stories (I say this in a good way) like Parts 2, 3, and so on. Sometimes, its nice to get a serious and old fashioned story, and its a shame that it's just so unjustly hated by the fandom. Lets discuss Jonathan before I move on, because this man is VERY misunderstood. He's often described as ""boring"" or ""bland"" or ""too good and perfect and makes no mistakes"" and ""a Gary Stu"". First of all, hes none of those things, as when he was a kid, he started out as a typical whiny blue blood punk brat who needed alot of growing up to do. Dio effectively forced him to grow up and gave him a newfound maturity and appreciation for life, and a sense of justice to boot. Jonathan is a simple character, not as developed or deep as later Joestars, but he doesnt have to be. I think hes an amazing character, and again, his simplicity does him nothing but favors in comparison to other Joestars. Hes sweet, kind, and I relate to his personality quite a bit, though even I am not as pure as he is, he simply is above me in that respect.

Let us move onto the next topic...

**\[Section 2:Why do people hate Part 1?\]**

Maybe hate is a strong word, but whenever you look at this fandom, and ignore the fact that Part 3 is the poster child of the series, what do you see? You see people sing the praises of Part 2 and the clever Joseph. You might see Part 3 and the introduction of Stands and the ensemble of amazing and hilarious characters, and the ever so well beloved cool guy Jotaro. You might see people talk about the charming Josuke, the soft spoken Giorno, the hard-ass hottie Jolyne, the smartass Johnny, or the enigmatic Josuke 8. However, guess who I just left out? Thats right, Jonathan, because most people dont respect or give two thirds of a shit about Jonathan or Part 1.

Like previously stated, he and Part 1 are often denounced as boring and so on, but that simply isnt true. While opinions are opinions and I hold no ill will towards those who feel this way, I have to wonder how much of it comes from valid criticism, and how much of it is...cultural or generational tastes? Maybe I just have an old soul, I come from Gen Z, so im not TOO far behind in age, but I feel like people these days dont value a simple or serious story. There seems to be no care or respect for the old fashioned ways of storytelling, and all anyone wants is the wacky freaky deaky crazy shit that Parts 2 and onward gives us. Nobody wants to sit down and be patient with the somber and calm nature of Part 1, and yes, even the infamous ""saggy middle"" is not as bad as people say.

The problem is honestly that most people who denounce Part 1 dont criticize it properly. I dont think it's perfect, but its certainly not the worst thing ever. The middle COULD have been better, sure, but he was just starting out and STILL did a good job writing it in my opinion, and the Part couldnt just be about Jonathan and Dio only, it needed to show the vast extent of Dio's efforts, his growing empire of monsters and demons, which by the way, I LOVED those zombies, especially the knights and fucking DOOBIE! They were fucking amazing to me, short lived as they were.

That said, there are valid arguments against Part 1, I just wish they were the vocal ones instead of the modern layman stereotypes we get. Part 1 is short, it can lag a bit here and there in the middle, and due to its short length, its simplicity has to sadly trade a bit of character development to work properly, and Jonathan and Dio seem to have funneled all the character personality from most other characters, so the Hamon Monks got especially screwed over in terms of development, while Speedwagon and Zeppeli got lucky, and George only barely manages to work well due to the writing being on POINT.

Let us move onto my last section...

**\[Section 3:The Legacy of Part 1\]**

Part 1 does SOMETIMES get praised, but its usually for very off-hand and casual things like ""it started it all"" or ""I liked Dio"" or ""We wouldnt have the other parts without it"", and while sure these ARE compliments with value, I feel like when people say it, it feels like a mandatory thing, like its a chore to them rather than actually seeing value in the part. Im sorry if I came off as whiny or complaining here, but I genuinely want to let you guys know that I ADORE this part. Part 1 is currently, by and large, the least liked part since I last checked, now I could be wrong, as people seem to not be huge fans of 5 or 6, but this is heresay and I have yet to confirm if this is true or not. However, Part 1 is the sad sheep, the forgotten one, the one of which nobody cosplays it's characters (I know some do, shush), the one which is barely acknowledged, and it's a sadly disrespected part.

If you dont like Part 1, thats fine, I do not hold anything against you, especially if your reasons are valid and make sense. However, I feel like the fandom needs to take a second look at Part 1 and try to appreciate it more, not everyone has to like it (I dont really like Part 4 that much personally), but like how I appreciate and respect Part 4, I think people should do the same for Part 1. Perhaps my worries are for naught and I'll find out that it's suddenly insanely popular, I dont know! But that was my little essay, I hope you guys enjoyed.

**\[TLDR\]**

Part 1 is an underrated victorian pseudo-horror story about a humble cast of simple but highly effective and well written characters that is sadly misunderstood and abused by the fandom for supposedly being boring and dull. Jonathan is not as boring or perfect as people think he is, as he went from bratty child to a still-growing but fully mature adult when Dio came into his life. People seem to dislike Part 1 in two spectrums, the valid arguments, and the seemingly greater number of those who dont appreciate the slower and more relaxed pace of Part 1, and its darker and more old fashioned themes, and I almost wonder if this is a generational or cultural gap. People only seem to care for the wacky goofy stuff of later parts these days, and I think we should try to appreciate Part 1 a little more going forward",32,1585060810,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fo66to/in_defense_of_jojo_part_1_and_why_i_think_it_is/,anime,1

fo5bch,DrGrabAss,"In our scary times, Iyahskai can really help!","Like most people right now, I've been feeling a little fear and anxiety around the coronavirus pandemic. I've even been losing a little sleep, even though I am more or less safe, cooped up in my house. Still, it bothers me that so many people are sick, out of work, and fearful about the future, where food is, etc. 

I almost forgot about Non Non Biyori and other iyashekai that have helped me relax in the past. I watched an episode just to get my mind off things this morning before work, and I immediately felt calmer and more hopeful. Non Non Biyori is one of my favorite shows, and the exact opposite of every shounen ever made. I invite everyone who is feeling stressed or scared to watch a few episodes of Non Non Biyori, Yuru Camp, Aria, and even Usagi Drop. I'm sure there are more I'm not thinking of, too. I might check out My Roommate is a cat, I heard it's not bad. Helpful Fox, though not my favorite, was pretty relaxing, too. And although Sora Yori isn't strictly an iyashekai, it sure did soothe my soul the first time I watched it. I might give it a rewatch. 

I might be posting this for my own benefit, to be honest. But, hopefully someone might read this and get the inspiration to use these shows for what they are meant to be, which is a little much-needed soul food.

Oregairu - The plot is about a loner's highschool life and the characters here (especially 8man)  think very realistically based on their personalities and past events. SSSS. Gridman - I personally love this series because the actual plot is about Akane Shinjo developing the ability to accept herself whilst mecha robots fight.

Of course the contents y'know, entertaining in some sense, but what got me was the outro. What was in it, and the SONG (BOI THE SONG), got me twerking hard.   
Anyhow, I can't find the channel again, nor the video and thus the song (cus fricken YOUTUBE \[nope, i'm just irresponsible af\]). But I do recall how the outro went initially.

It showcased a short scene of Mitsuha from 'Your Name' doing her shrine dance before cutting to a small fight between Haku and Oshutoru from the utawarerumono itsuwari no kamen anime.

Finding this song again is probably some impossible odds, but I'm just grabbing onto any little bit of hope I can get haha. I'm hoping one of you has the answer :DDD",0,1585046466,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fo315j/curious_about_a_song_dont_remember_it_video_which/,anime,1

fo2kji,LilithFairenWrites,It's going to be great when Magia Record's second season gets cancelled because the first didn't have enough teenage girls violently die to suit perverts' tastes.,"The only reason anyone thinks Madoka Magica has any depth is because it shits on the entire female gender, it shits on empowering fiction for girls, and it exists purely to reinforce gross sexist attitudes towards girls and to tell men how girls having ambition and hope is literally evil.

Then Magia Record comes along and while it's still shallow angst tripe, it doesn't have teenage girls being violently killed or becoming insane monsters because of petty crap. It hasn't promoted the idea that girls' role in life is to give up on their hopes and dreams and their very lives.

And as a result no one cares about it but the hardcore fanboys who can't say anything bad about the franchise. It's a dead series with no life beyond the initial series because all it had going for it was ""hey, let's watch girls suffer and die!"" and now that's a dime a dozen these days.",11,1585044027,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fo2kji/its_going_to_be_great_when_magia_records_second/,anime,1

fo1kv4,BoyBrandeeno,Just finished Gamers!,"Man this show was so frustrating... but that's not necessarily a bad thing!

Seeing all the comments on VRV bashing the show saying ""it's not even about gaming"" and ""these characters are so dumb with their misunderstandings,"" I personally think are completely missing the point of this show.

I believe it's SUPPOSED to be painfully ditzy, something that makes you say ""Oh, come ON, that would NEVER happen in real life,"" and that is true, it would never happen in real life. But we have to remember, this is anime. A genre where we can make the most ridiculous scenarios for the sake of humor.

I don't think this show was ever supposed to be taken seriously, in the sense that there aren't any super deep romance/character development arcs. It really is just a super ditzy show with no point, and there's something quite charming about that.

It's not all good though. There were a lot of times where I wanted to drop the show. While the plot is centered around misunderstandings, there were times where it began to feel like a drag, just something to get more episodes out there. It became annoying at times. But I stuck with it.

Also, the last episode felt a lot more like an OVA than an actual finale... the second to last episode felt a lot more like a finale to me. The misunderstandings were cleared up, the love triangle between Tendou, Amani, and Chiaki was resolved, and all loose ends seemed to be tied up. The last episode seemed kind of pointless, unless of course it's viewed as an OVA, which in my eyes makes a lot more sense so that's how I've chosen to view it.

At the end of the day, if you're looking for a show with super compelling drama, in-depth romance, and deeply rooted character development, you won't find it here. Gamers! is a show that I can describe as a guilty pleasure, something that you watch even though it's not chock full of substance, but you enjoy anyways. It's just a really ditzy show, but as long as you understand that, it can be quite charming!",8,1585038472,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fo1kv4/just_finished_gamers/,anime,1

fo0x97,ket2445,Code Geass ending was Sad?,"I just recently finished Code Geass and I thought it was very good largely attributed to it's great ending. Only critiques of mine being inconsistent pacing and writing alone with the magic / fantasy aspects in season 2 being handled a little poorly.

But that is not the point of this post. I have been reading online of the many different perspectives of the ending and I have yet to come across one that I'm in agreement with. The almost unanimous verdict is this was a sad ending and that lelouches death was heartbreaking. 

Lelouch is one of my favourite characters from any anime I have seen, but the ending seemed to leave me with a feeling of satisfaction and happiness and kind of left me grinning. Dont get me wrong I'm not happy in particular that hes dead. 

I think the fact that he died smiling, on his own terms and that he did for a noble cause left me feeling proud. And honestly if he had not died we would have ended the series with him as a villain, which would have made me a lot sadder. Also the fact that his philosophies of leading as the king and those who kill must be prepared to die come full circle.

I'm honestly wondering whether I'm alone on this. Anyone else have a similar feeling after the finale or was it a tear jerker for all?",26,1585034587,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fo0x97/code_geass_ending_was_sad/,anime,1

fo0ki6,Randombobman,Help with Anime Title,"I'm having trouble remembering the name of an anime movie I watched like eight years ago. The basic premise is a post-apocalyptic world that was destroyed after a science experiment on the moon vastly increased plant growth and intelligence. As a result the moon was partially destroyed and the newly created plant life migrated down to earth and proceeded to destroy modern society. The movie begins with an adolescent boy finding a girl coming out of a cryo sleep chamber and takes her back to his village. The village sits between the realm of militant humans amidst a desert and the hyper intelligent plant beings who somehow control the moisture in the atmosphere and thus where rainfall occurs. The girl coming out of cold sleep triggers the world's balance to be disrupted as the plant species fears she has a bracelet that could activate a relic of the old human world that could destroy them.

fo06iu,jusjohn55,Is there a way for fans to contact a studio/donate money for a anime to get a new season?,"Like many, there are many who want another season of an anime they love. I am not saying multiple seasons like Naruto and that, just another season to finish the source material. As the years go on, I feel like studios just forget about these animes since most of the time they are working on new ones. I am aware that studios only make a new season if they have enough money or if they have enough source material. However, animes like Noragami has more than enough source material, it is just that the studio making it is also the studio working on My Hero. So some good animes are just drowned out by the excessively popular ones. 

That being said, is there a way for fans of an anime to contact a studio to remind them(in case they forgot since years go by after the initial release) or to possibly donate money?(ik you can buy merchandise and stuff but that can only do so much)",19,1585030423,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fo06iu/is_there_a_way_for_fans_to_contact_a_studiodonate/,anime,1

This has happened to me more times than I'd care to admit, and I'd slip into a deep depression for a couple days after that. I've been re-watching as well as binge-ing some new anime now due to the quarantines, and whenever I finish watching, it's like there's a gaping hole in my heart.

This happens especially when the anime in question falls under the slice-of-life genre. Because of the state-wide lockdown, it's not like I can meet up with my friends and drive away my feelings of depression either. I am dreading watching any new series because of this now. I've been putting off  a lot of new series and am just re-watching some series where I don't feel as emotionally invested.

Has this ever happened to anyone else? How did you guys get out of this emotional coma? What do you suggest I should do?

P.S. With the new season of Bleach as well as Burn the Witch OVA releasing in the next year, I am virtually dreading watching them because I have gotten so emotionally attached to the characters of Bleach that I don't think I can handle it when it finally ends.

fnxu7b,Deanio_19,Where and Why MHA season 4 sucks,"After noticing woes in the season, I quickly looked deeper into the leadership and found out about the new director for this Season, which wasn't surprising as many things were executed and done differently with Masahiro Mukai at the directors helm, which is usually occupied by many other during the duration of a season or Kenji Nagasaki at regular. The action was slow to startup even with the explosive 2nd week premiere (which had a lower quality than the filler EP), where Magna met her demise by Chisaki, which didn't hit as hard as it should've in part to the cheap compensation animation tricks, and first level setup for the Highway scene which was botched terribly. In terms of the blueprint, I liked the arcs covered here, they were great arcs with some of the richest moments within the series to date. But anime¬† production botched nearly all of them. The conclusion of the Gentle fight is most likely the conclusion of action in this season. My hard take is it lacks creativity, confidence and emotion. Not to mention the BG's they looked spaced out at times and confined when convenient, and all were generic as they came, and looked similar with wall and floor texture, I was thinking underground tunnels wouldn't be so posh either. But I guess it bodes well with Overhaul's cleanliness. Flashbacks in this season seemed like an over utilized tool by the staff, to prolong action heavy episodes and confine them to cliffhangers, which distorted the pacing, additionally where the previous 3 seasons would get imaginative and add scenes, off obscure small panels within the manga, I don't think the 4th Season did enough of this.¬†

The Highway Hijack Scene which is what I call it, was probably one of the best moments of the arc, Tamaki, Mirio, Kirishima and Deku aside. Given its different staging, being on a highway. And us getting a good look at our main plot villains, make a move, which we hadn't seen in over a year, since the beginning of Season 3. The animation here was stiff and poor, you could tell the director didn't care much to put emphasis on this scene as much as the 6 second godly display Yutaka did an episode before. Not to mention the cutting of Spinners GTA line and the obvious botch of the final panel of Shigaraki, Dabi and Compress walking away from the wreckage. It's the worst action sequence in the anime to date and sums up how I feel about this 4th season. From Dabi casually leaping off a moving truck, the lack of detail of Shigaraki decaying the convoy driver, through the windshield to Snatch magically flying, and being sealed by Compress without being touched. This sequence was the worst of all the worst of this season.¬†

Mirio Vs Overhaul, I waited for this episode eagerly, for the stellar job the anime usually does with the animation, but... I was woefully disappointed and so were a lot other people by the mangling of this big moment. In my opinion this was bigger than Deku taking out Overhaul. MHA doesn't choose when to be great, the animation is just that good. So I figured the way this season was going maybe they'd put more focus here. Nope. They obviously saved money here, as they toggled picture frames, and utilized a slideshow, giving slight angle differences from the panels in the manga to deceive viewers into not noticing the lack of quality.¬† The scene where Mirio fortifies his conviction to be a hero and crushes Nemoto and Slosh, was very poor. Where he relentlessly attacks them, in the manga it's hard to follow, so I hoped the anime would clarify, but nope. In terms of importance, this was big for his character, quite a shame there won't be a redo, I will say the emotion was there, just not the usual MHA touch, this moment had the emotion of All Might vs AFO.¬†

Team Ryuku vs Rikiya, every Big 3 member gets their moment to shine, except Nejire, MHA is masterful at expanding the material that Horikoshi gives them, though this new director didn't take, as the Ryuku fight was mostly skipped over in favor of one climax to the other. Which is very poor directing. Seasons 2 or 3 would've expanded the fight for a moment to shine and taken us out of the cramped confines of those tunnels. Remember the Endeavor Vs Nomu fight in season 2, it was entirely original. I hoped for something on those lines. The missing light shine on Nejire, makes this season feel real sexists and somewhat forgettable that this was partly a big 3 arc.¬†

Deku vs Overhaul, people raved about this moment online, but I wasn't at all impressed with the sequence. Deku literally air swims around him, and then does an insanely animated punching sequence by Yutaka, which gives me One Punch Man flashbacks, it's a cheap 6 second thrill to get people talking about a season that's been so lackluster in terms of quality, I foretold the weeklong buzz social media was going to have on it. Sadly, but rightfully it was the only animation praising moment that MHA had this time around, where it usually draws 4 or 5 per season.

Midoriya vs Gentle, The first episode of the Gentle fight was an obvious trainwreck, they utilized flashbacks to prolong the chapter to the next episode, which ruined the action and pacing of the bout, hoping to hinge on the reveal of Midoriya utilizing Air-force on an actual villain, the move just isn't that impressive animated and it's another botched moment. During the 2nd EP, it did good in evoking my sympathy for the wounded team, but the climaxing St. Louis Smash is poorly executed.¬†

For more clarification on how I feel about the lack of emotion and botched action, look to moments from the other seasons Season 1, All Might Rescuing Bakugo, Midoriya vs 0. Bakugo &amp; Midoriya training, All Might Vs Nomu. Season 2, Bakugo vs Ochako, Midoriya vs Shoto, Endeavor Vs Nomu, Midoriya &amp; Katsuki vs All Might. Season 3, Midoriya vs Muscular, Testu &amp; Kendo vs Gas villain, All Might Vs AFO, Kacchan vs Midoriya, Mirio Vs 1-A. Opposed to season 4s, Midoriya vs Nighteye, Kirishima vs Villain, Suneater vs 3'8 Bullets, Mirio Vs Overhaul, Midoriya vs Overhaul, LoV vs convoy and¬† Midoriya vs Gentle. None of these moments packed the same impact of its predecessors and if you compare and contrast you'll see the woes and trouble this season had with its action moments.¬†

This season sucked plain and simple, I liked the arcs, just not the adaptation of them. The series usually cashes in on big moments from the manga, but here it couldn't do it. Though this season isn't without it's good episodes namely EP 5. None of the action hit like the previous seasons, the directing seemed very off throughout the episodes and the characters designs seemed wonky and inconsistent at times. Small animation tricks to compensate for lack of animating motion killed a lot of the action as they relied heavily on single cuts instead stylistic whole pieces of action. This season has 2 Episodes left which looks like it's starting off the Hero arc or whatever people call it. I hope this season doesn't try to take on the Kyushu incident. That belongs to the Season 3 Episode 11, team. Hopefully Nagasaki and Umakoshi return fresh for the 5th season.

fnxbxj,Blake-the-cautionary,Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?'s one semi-major flaw (other than some of the stuff it gets wrong),"TL;DR: no fat people in the show is offputting seeing as the whole shows about fitness and the majority of the world have a weight problem (it isn't just America).

after seeing the show 4 times (it has helped me personally to get motivated to at least get active again), I've come to the most annoying comment/rant anyone could have about this show and why some would shrug it off as unrealistic, the show literally has no overweight main cast.

yep, you heard me. it has no fat chicks trying to ""get swole"". maybe its because it wouldn't be good entertainment or they, didn't know how to do it correctly with the rest of the cast but there aren't women in this show that you see often that has a BMI over 22, Sakura Hibiki doesn't count as fat, as much as they show off to be as somewhat of a pig (her BMI at the start of the show was 21.6 even with that ""35% body fat"" ) she isn't even close.

normally this isn't a problem seeing as most shows skim overweight like its an easy thing to get over or make it comedic by having them do a quick montage of a cast member getting into shape or them getting fit in a time skip (say over summer vacation). However, this show is more serious about weight and it's more realistic, so why aren't there any 200-300 pound (90-135 kgs) girls getting bikini ready? it's offputting for some actual overweight people. not that it really matters to me but the show could be 100% with at least 1 fat chick instead of that 93% it has without it.

Yumehara Chiyo from Saiki K comes to mind when I think of fat girls trying to get into shape, she's not actually fat in the show for that long mind you but she actually became overweight from her binge eating and snacking (it only lasted an episode or two, which was kinda lame seeing as it was unrealistic but that's a different show altogether). Mera Chisato (also from Saiki K) also fits here too, but it seems her weight is maintained by countless hours of manual labor and near malnutrition.",12,1585017409,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fnxbxj/dumbbell_nan_kilo_moterus_one_semimajor_flaw/,anime,1

fnukrm,Animescience101,The Biology of Gunbuster,"  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iptsn3ircio41.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89de04f03b484b0c6cfee0cf0da07690775c6055

Look, I get it, those of you know about Gunbuster want to hear about the astrophysics, not the biology, and I do plan to attempt to do the astrophysics of Gunbuster. What you guys have to remember is that I am a biology teacher not an astrophysicist, and astrophysics breaks my brain and calculator. As for the rest of you who wonder just what the heck Gunbuster is, it is the directorial debut of Hideki Anno, famous for creating the iconic Neongenesis Evangelion. Gunbuster is a 6-episode OVA that was released in 1988, and it has all of the classic elements of 80‚Äôs anime. It also holds up surprisingly well, and I would go as far as to say that the facial expressions are better than a lot of what we see in today‚Äôs anime. As for the plot, it is fairly simple: giant space monsters threaten Earth, so the Earth (aka Japan) builds a super robot to fight them. As a result, most of the series takes place in space and a main element of the show is the effect that time dilation via travel at or near light speed has on the main characters. I promise to try and dig into time dilation, but first let‚Äôs take a look at the biology of Gunbuster.

&amp;#x200B;

**Space Monsters**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0k45a14tcio41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=984cb22dad492f9fa175c2cae5abd63303a9d6ea

The first and most obvious topic and perhaps the easiest to look at is the giant space monsters that are the antagonists of the series. Given that Gunbuster is only 6 episodes long, not much time is given to them beyond the fact that they are huge, want to exterminate humanity, and reproduce inside young stars. The giant monster part I have already discussed in a previous post on the Vajra of Macross Frontier.  As for the reproducing inside of young stars‚Ä¶. Yeah, I‚Äôve got nothing to explain that one. Stars are literally giant balls of nuclear fusion, and I can‚Äôt think of any remotely possible biological system that could survive in that kind of environment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do they want to exterminate humanity?**

Surprisingly, Gunbuster does actually answer this question. The short version is that the galaxy is like a living thing, and the space monsters are the immune system, tasked with destroying humanity, which is like an infectious bacterium. Yes, they actually said that and I think it was inspired by the Gaia hypothesis.

The Gaia hypothesis was put forward by chemist James Lovelock, coauthored with biologist Lynn Margulis in the 1970‚Äôs, and has largely been ignored or seen with skepticism since then. The basic idea is that the Earth is alive in a sense and in a symbiotic relationship with all of the living things living on Earth. Some support for the idea comes from how photosynthesis and cellular respiration in phototrophs and heterotrophs regulate the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Now for some of the problems with the theory, it basically ignores natural selection and evolution, as parts of the Gaia hypothesis would require certain organisms to have the ability to think and plan to make the system work. Such abilities are outside the range of the organisms in question. And I think we can all come up with one particular living thing on the planet that is really good at wrecking the environment when it wants to, instead of fixing or regulating it. That would be us humans, if you were confused. Lastly, it lacks evidence and has several theoretical holes that I do not want to go into here.

This begs the question why did Hideki Anno use it in Gunbuster or even hear about such a hypothesis? Honestly, I have no idea, but I will say that the hypothesis was on prominent display in the Osaka Aquarium, so maybe it was better received in Japan. Either way let‚Äôs assume that the space monsters are the galaxy‚Äôs immune system, and that humanity is a bacterium as put forth by Gunbuster. I see one big problem with this plot line, and that is that humanity is never shown spreading out and colonizing areas beyond the solar system or even within the solar system. So, humanity is hardly big enough to warrant the massive attacks mounted by the space monsters. It also does not broach the idea of living with the space monsters in a symbiotic relationship, which is one of the tenets of Gaia theory. **FYI-** if you want to see humans and space monsters working together, check out Macross Frontier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Space Radiation Sickness**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ckn6vruucio41.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ae8945f9e993dbc7d08d545c5f15c5e58352f53

The second, and dare I say more important plot point, is Commander Koichiro Ohta (aka Coach)‚Äôs injuries and illness. The injuries are predictably from a battle that takes place before the series begins. The illness is left unspecified until episode 5 when Noriko and Kazumi discover that he has something called space radiation sickness after he falls coughing up blood. First things first, there is no such thing as space radiation sickness; that being said, there is a ton of radiation in space and it is something that astronauts and high-altitude pilots need to protect themselves against. For example, a 6 month stay on the International Space Station is an exposure over ten times the amount of radiation the average American might experience in 1 year.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z42mlfj0dio41.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02c5fcacb03d9fd70325ae8e5aa22bcf84ee4f9b

&amp;#x200B;

To put things another way, astronauts can be exposed to up to 2,000 mSv (millisieverts are a measure of radiation), during a 6-month trip, and your risk of cancer goes up after exposure to 100 mSv.

I think Hideki Anno‚Äôs second source of inspiration for space radiation sickness came from the Hibakusha (atomic bomb survivors). There were over 500,000 survivors of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and they were in a brief period of time exposed to extremely high levels of radiation similar to, if not greater than, what astronauts face (it depends on the amount of time they spend in space). Those survivors faced and still face a number health effects as a result of their experience. These health issues include much higher risk of cancer, cataracts, reproductive issues (probably why Kazumi never had child with Coach), and an increased risk of certain infectious diseases, just to name a few.

Thus, I think what Hideki Anno is referring to with space radiation sickness is not chronic exposure to radiation, but instead the lingering after-effects of a single event. The technology of Gunbuster is incredibly advanced, so I can‚Äôt imagine their ships lacking shielding to block radiation. Additionally, the threat posed by space radiation is never once mentioned and no one other than Coach is suffering from exposure to radiation. Yet, Noriko and Kazumi both know and recognize the situation for what it is. This leads me to believe that this is something that everyone who travels through space knows about, but that it is not a common occurrence.

This leads us to the question of when was Coach exposed to a high dose of radiation, and how he survived past the 6-month time limit he was given in the show. I think the most obvious choice is that he was exposed during the first disastrous battle humanity had with the space monsters and that led to the death of Noriko‚Äôs father. A nearly destroyed ship and escape pod is probably not nearly as resistant to radiation as a fully intact ship. On a final note- this is one instance of my theory being proven by the show itself. In the sequel to Gunbuster, Diebuster, Tycho‚Äôs buster machine is destroyed and she is exposed to space without her spacesuit on for a short time and is later shown being treated for space radiation sickness, thus proving it is from brief unprotected exposure to the radiation present in space.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason I like this explanation is that it also provides a logical way for Coach to have survived past the 6-month time limit he was given.

**Comments of the Day**

[Quiddity131](https://www.reddit.com/user/Quiddity131) discusses one of the show‚Äôs most iconic scenes.

&gt; The episode's ending sequence is one of the most effective scenes in the show. In fact I'd argue this is one of the sadder scenes in a Tomino anime. Imagine knowing that a bomb has been implanted in you, it can't be taken out and you could explode at any moment? It is such a sad fate for those who walk away at the episode's end, knowing they are doomed. Hanamoto tries to be mature and adult about it, but can't take it and totally breaks down, screaming out for a mother and father that are already dead, before exploding. He didn't go out like a man as he had hoped, he went out as a crying child. But how many wouldn't go out that way if this was their fate? A really effective sequence for me. Makes this the best episode of the show thus far.

**Questions of the Day:**

1) Aki poses as the first person close to Kappei who has perished. How do you think this will figure into his character arc, if at all?

2) Was Aki a character that you thought might be killed off through the course of the story? Who else have you pegged as ripe for a reaping?

fnt9vt,SorcererOfTheLake,[WT!] Yuru Camp/Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho: Going Beyond Yourself,"Two anime come out in the same season. Both are acclaimed as some of the best of their season, if not the year. They have some clear similarities in their appearance and stories; both series have female casts that find themselves involved in new activities that bond them together tightly, presented with illustrious visuals and fantastic soundtracks. They also have their differences, most notably in their feelings; one is more comfy and laid-back in their experiences, while the other is constantly moving further and seeing what lies outside of the normal.

Even without the title, there‚Äôs a good chance you recognize these shows as *Yuru Camp* and *Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho* from the Winter of 2018. I‚Äôm combining them into one WT because, even with those differences I mentioned, there are both about the same thing: finding ways to expand your horizons and to realize who you are, either by yourself or with others.

**Yuru Camp: The Small Delights**

*Yuru Camp* is based on the manga of the same name by Afro; it was brought to an animated format by C-Station, directed by Yoshiaki Kyoguku and series composed by Jin Tanaka (*Anne Happy*, *Go! Princess Precure,* *Kirakira Precure a la Mode*). The series begins with Rin Shima, an introverted first-year high school student, going on a trip to conduct her favorite activity: winter camping around Mount Fuji. Being so cold, there‚Äôs hardly anyone around to bother her, but she still finds an unexpected companion: Nadeshiko Kagamihara, an easily-excited puppy-like girl who is new to the area and comes to quickly love the sensations of camping. Upon entering her new school, she enters the Outdoor Activities Circle, currently comprising of Chiaki Ogaki and Aoi Inuyama. The series follows the Circle, alongside Rin and her best friend Ena Saitou, on their many experiences with camping, as one or with all.

Translated as *Laid-Back Camp,* the series is perhaps the pure embodiment of being *comfy* or *blissful.* All the series asks of the viewer is to watch the girls in their everyday lives and it always remains enchanting. Nothing major happens, but every moment is important. From enjoying a small meal together to navigating a quiet countryside at the dead of night, the whole series is tinged with a layer of magic, an understanding of how we connect with nature and how it connects us. Tied into this comfy aspect is a wonderful main cast of girls that are always enchanting. Brought to life by some of the most talented voice actresses in the business right now (Yumiri Hanamori, Nao Touyama, Sayuri Haya, Aki Toyosaka, and Rie Takahashi), the five main characters are all different in their outlooks and personalities, yet they all share an inherent joy of life, an energy that makes them seek out every opportunity that comes their way and figure out what it can do for them.

*Yuru Camp* is not only a comfy series, but a beautiful one. The animation moves with a grace that gives the characters a vitality to them that is sometimes missing in other slice of life series. More than that, though, the true beauty of the visuals comes from the landscape. The series paints the forests and campgrounds as vivid locations, full of life and capable of awe. It is no surprise that these girls come to love camping when they‚Äôre sounded by beautiful vistas such as these. Adding onto that is the soundtrack of the series, perhaps the best technical aspects of the series. Fitting the series‚Äô comfy approach, [the soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cs_wheBIvs) primarily utilizes acoustic instrumentation to add to the woodsy, naturalistic vibe of the series. Notably, some of the tracks have a Gaelic/Irish feeling to them, creating a slight air of mysticism to the girls‚Äô trips and embracing the fluid nature of their experiences.

As I mentioned earlier, while the events of the series are small in the grand scheme of things, the bonds and connections that are made are not insignificant, and this connection is what helps elevate *Yuru Camp* above many of its peers. Nadeshiko and Rin are two people that couldn‚Äôt try harder to be opposites, yet their arcs throughout the show are similar in that they find themselves becoming comfortable with experiences outside of themselves. Nadeshiko is previously ambivalent to camping before falling in love with its joys, while the loner Rin is able to experience a different kind of pleasure from spending personal time with others, even if not all of the time. The joy of *Yuru Camp* comes from seeing these girls create intimate bounds over late nights of cooking food, setting up camp, and knowing that, even surrounded by the vastness of nature, there is always someone close by who feels the same as you.

**Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho: Going Further**

As opposed to *Yuru Camp‚Äôs* adaptational basis, *Yorimoi* is an original story animated by Madhouse, with direction by Atsuko Ishizuka (*The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,* *No Game No Life,* *Hanayamata*) and series composition by Jukki Hanada (*Love Live!,* *Hibike! Euphonium,* *Bloom into You,* *No Game No Life,* *Nichijou*). The series introduces us to Mari ‚ÄúKimari‚Äù Tamaki, an ordinary high-school student who wants to make the most of her youth, and Shirase Kobuchizawa, a schoolmate who plans to head to Antarctica to find her mother, who went missing during an expedition three years ago. Accompanied by Hinata Miyake, a wise yet energetic girl who is preparing for college, and Yuzuki Shiraishi, a well-known child actress/semi-idol who is straight-forward yet awkward, the foursome makes plants to join a civilian expedition while dealing with their pasts and futures.

From the moment it starts, *Yorimoi* never stops looking forward, both in terms of plot and character. Each episode introduces a new problem and situation and quickly resolves within the same episode, yet the show never feels episodic. Rather, the events of each episode build on top of one another creating a segmented structure that still forms a whole. Through this narrative style, the show is always able to keep the audience‚Äôs interest in what‚Äôs going on and have a complex narrative from beginning to end. Likewise, the cast, both main and secondary, is always developing, even at the smallest moments of the series. Through watching them accept these challenges and grow as people, the series creates a deep bond between the viewer and the characters, moreso than most due to the incredible vocal performances of the four girls by Inori Minase, Kana Hanazawa, Yuka Iguchi, and Saori Hayami respectively.

If *Yuru Camp* asks us to embrace the beauty in the natural world, then *Yorimoi* overwhelms us with the wonders laying all around us. From Tokyo to Singapore to Australia and Antarctica, the world of *Yorimoi* is illustrated in vivid colors and tones while still maintaining a realistic feel. The direction and editing of the series is just as full of wonder, seen in moments like the now-iconic [Youth in Motion scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmBx3MrTBt4); the show has a way of presentation that is able to create a strong subjective mood, from the agony of loss and the pain of the past to the joy of friendship and the sheer wonder of moving forward in life. [The soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WLEuQ5Q9c) helps with that wonder by giving each scene a strong dramatic tone that makes every decision of these characters important to witness, even if it‚Äôs as small as a hug, a glance, or a message.

Even if they start off in separate worlds, Mari, Shirase, Hinata, and Yuzuki all realize they have something in common: life has made them feel isolated from themselves and from the desires in life. Thus, it‚Äôs only fitting that, by the end of their adventure, their trust in each other has become the most powerful thing in their lives and in the show overall. The four girls don‚Äôt start off as immediate friends; conflicts and issues come up between them as their outlooks and experiences become clear. Yet, the show uses these moments to explore the ways friendships are built and developed, with the girls becoming stronger the more that they understand people and situations outside of their frames of reference. Friendship is not something easily made and branded, but rather strengthened by understanding how others around you have become a part of you.

**Conclusion**

In some ways, I think we‚Äôre always aware that we are incomplete beings. We will not experience everything in the world, either due to time, money, location, or just plain circumstances. We may not always understand who we are or what we want in life. What *Yuru Camp* and *Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho* say in response to that is that incompleteness is a part of life; in response to that, we must try to move beyond our boundaries and find a path that lets us explore more of who we are. It won‚Äôt always be easy, but if you have people that you trust around you, it‚Äôll be smoother. I wouldn‚Äôt exactly say that these series make me want to be a better person; rather, they ask of us to embrace that which we have ignored before and see if we recognize ourselves within it, if only for a moment. Our narrative will be over before we know it; shouldn‚Äôt that encourage us to move past our selves?",13,1585001979,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/fnt9vt/wt_yuru_campsora_yori_mo_tooi_basho_going_beyond/,anime,1

[Bubble Girl, My Hero Academia](https://preview.redd.it/c15c0wrnrho41.jpg?width=1199&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53bf84ed60afd53c2867cdd886b2bf372959a6e3)

**Where in the world can I find face masks like these?**

Not really interested in the full helmet of the *Last Exile* flight suits, but the face mask part looks to be separate. Bubble Girl's is a little less realistic, owing to the fact that you can see her eyebrows moving under and out of her mask all the time, so it's clearly not properly sealed to her face against atmospheric air. The *Last Exile* masks, though, have microphones rather than filter ports, which is what I would want, whether light weight filters to attach directly to the mask, or larger belt mounted ones with a tube to the mask.

I don't like how standard medical-type mask obscures people's faces while not actually protecting the eyes. It's not just breathing in Coronaviruses, its also getting them on your hands and then transferring them to your eyes and mouth. These kinds of full face masks would prevent all of that, while letting people see each others' faces. Problem is, I can't find anything like them anywhere. Anything close has a secondary cup that still obscures the mouth and nose, or they're designed for full SCUBA (underwater or fire-fighting) use.

And why does Bubble Girl wear her mask anyway? If those things are filters on either side, they're clearly too small to be effective.

And before anyone asks, I know these things exist in the real world. The characters of Jordan and Mitch wore a pair like these when pumping anesthetizing gas into Kent's room in the movie *Real Genius* (1985).
