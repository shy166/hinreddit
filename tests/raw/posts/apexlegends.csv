fsmt50,WandeRNation,Game freezes after the countdown in the dropship,"Today, my game started freezing after the dropship and I have literally tried everything in order to fix that. The game just freezes and I have to force end it using task manager. There is no error code, nothing!

I saw other guys who started facing this problem 21 days ago and it got fixed after some time but it is occurring again for some reason and there were people who were commenting today itself on the post saying that it has occurred for them again as well.

Things I have tried so far:

Updating my graphics card drivers

Repairing the game

Clearing origin cache

Re-installing the game

Re-installing origin

Repairing Easy Anti-CHeat

Changing video settings such as Display mode, graphics settings, etc

Tried Alt-Tabbing 

&amp;#x200B;

none of these worked so far.

If any of you got fixes for this please let me know!

fsmord,CRAZYSHARK2013,Apex Ranked Reward System Rework Concept,"Hi, recently I and many others in the community have felt dissatisfied with the way the ranked reward dive trails will work at the end of our current season (Season 4) so here's some ideas I had to try to make a fair yet satisfying way for them to be earned.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dive Trail Reworking**

Since diamond has had the dive trail reward revoked in this current season and from here on out it would make more sense for permanent dive trails to remain for masters and predator rank. After all, those ranks can be a hard thing to achieve even for most above average players. The idea for them being seasonal dive trails implemented by Respawn (as brought out in their devstream) is to insure ranked play will not only increase in numbers but also keep them stable throughout future seasons. They hope that players will grind every season so they maintain their dive trail status, when in reality it discourages the player base from playing in the first place since the dive trail isnt a permanent reward making it less sought after. So here is the system I thought of to keep both ideas in place:

Dive Trail earning requirements:

Temporary Dive Trails: Given to those who achieve their rank in only one of the two splits.

Permanent Dive Trails: Given to those who achieve their rank both splits.

(Another idea is to make the predator trail permanent no matter what since it is the hardest rank to maintain in the game, so players holding this rank should be entitled to a permanent trail anyways.)

&amp;#x200B;

This is my idea and I hope you all can agree with my opinion, let me know what you think in the poll below!

fsls0a,SirOrange01,Am I the only one struggling with gunfights in Apex Legends?,I am a long time FPS gamer. I have been aiming at targets since I was a little kid. For the past 5 years I have had a K/D ratio of 1 or above in every competitive FPS game I played except Apex Legends.  I am stuck at .93 and I feel like I can't aim to save my life. In BF or CoD games my aim is above average. I usually land my bullets and I am pretty confident in my ability to outgun my opponents. But in Apex I feel like a complete useless trash can. I have played for over 300 hours and I still feel like people move too fast in Apex. Tracking them feels impossible especially if they use certain abilities or if they have godlike movement. I sometimes can't even see where I'm shooting at. The enemies are hard as hell to see and the muzzle flash doesn't help it either. Recently played some CoD:Warzone and not bragging or anything I feel like a god while playing that game. My aim is significantly more consistent and better. I can easily spot targets and I get over 4 kills almost every game. So my  guess would be that this game is harder than the games I am used to playing.  Am I right or am I missing some of the key points of gunplay in this game?

fsk3s1,TymtheguyIguess,Bring back disruptor rounds,"Yeah you heard me. But I have a great idea to make them more balanced (even though they were perfectly balanced in the first place) and a buff idea for the sentinel.

For the RE-45 and Alnertanter they multiply shield damage by 2x, and health damage by 0.75x. This would mean that after you spend your ammo on a target, you could switch to something like the P2020 or Mozambique with hammer point to swiftly finish an enemy. This would shake up the still reasonably steady meta of ‚ÄúR99/LSTAR+PK/EVA-8‚Äù and make the more niche weapons more used.

For the sentinel, equipping disruptor rounds would make it so that disruptor and health damage would stack, so that a headshot instantly knocks someone down, and you can charge the sentinel with shield cells.

fsjuth,reallyreallycoolguy6,"Specter, phantom of the arena","Thanks to [u/cole1608](https://www.reddit.com/user/cole1608) for original concept. I'm just buffing his up. 

Real name: Alyssa Manes  

Appearance: gaunt, but still beautiful blonde woman wrapped in rags and filthy body armor  

Background: Alyssa was a normal woman who joined the IMC to fight the evil(not) militia. She proved extremely talented, but in the first live fire exercise, she got shot at by a rubber round that passed straight through her (like she wasn't there. Just realized that sounds like it gutted her). The IMC expiremented on her, speeding up her deterioration. She is now a literal shadow of her former self, looking for help with her condition. She joined the Apex games for money to seek out doctors that she knows won't help.  Personality: despairing, determined, and calm  

NOW FOR THE FUN STUFF!!! Abilities:  

Passives: 

Low profile 

Untraceable- Spectre can't be tracked by bloodhound, crypto' drone, wattson's fence, or anything else I can't remember. Also, hit markers don't show for her (damage numbers still show)  

Tactical: Shadow hiding- Specter holds up her hands, balls them into fists, then pulls them down as they dissolve into mist. Specter is extremely hard to see, being just a gray mist. She can't shoot, and her speed is at 60%, but indoors she almost disappears. No cool down. It's just like a different mode.  

Ultimate: Specter's vision goes wavy, then she and anyone within 5 feet of her teleport to the place she was looking. If she looks at the sky, the team travels 500 meters and are able to use their jump packs. This can be used to meme, to move around, or to reposition, or to get out of storm.

Whenever I try to join the game, it says that the connection to EA servers has failed. After numerous retries I get into the game only to find myself with massive issues joining my friends lobby. After numerous additional attempts of joining (5-15 minutes) I finally get into a lobby with them. After that we cannot find a game of ranked because the party isnt level 10 yet (we are all 80+)

Then after we resolved that problem, we take ages to find a match, then we finally find one game and when that is over and we are back to lobby (if the game allows us to reconnect to the lobby, also taking multiple minutes sometimes), the same issues repeat, sometimes just 2 of us connect to the game, sometimes just one.

It just sucks so damn bad. Why are the server so bad? Is there a reason for it?

fsize7,TexanBloodhound,Ideas Thread!!,"Hello all,

In my off time, I love to come up with these wacky ideas for LTMs, and come up with unique quips for each legend that would be available from said event. I try to take careful consideration into the legends personality when I make these quips, so that these sound as real as possible.

I want you to come up with an LTM, doesn't matter how good or bad it is, tell me the general idea of what the LTM is, and the legend you want me to make a quip for.

Example: ""Wild Wild West LTM, based around cowboy-esk skins and cosmetics. Bangalore""

Bangalore: ""Top of the clock, you get the glock... you're goin' down partner""

fsius3,qaa003,Apex Legends: Buffs Edition,"The community has been asking Respawn for buffs on certain heroes for a while now. Figured I compile them and add a few of my own ideas in the mix.

Mirage:

Encore! (Passive)- Downed cloak extension 5s -&gt;7s and 5% downed spd buff. 

Psyche Out (Tactical)- 1-&gt;2 clones and improve clunky clone movement. Ex: When under cover, clones may peek out to lure opponents. 

Vanishing Act (Ult) - Improve or Change clones movement for better escape and 5% spd buff on use with 1% additional spd buff for each clone shot at. Optional: Replace with Dummy ‚ÄúDance Party‚Äù Ult.


Octane:

Swift Mends (Passive)- 5% Faster Med heals and 5% Grenade Dmg Reduction 

Stim (Tactical)- While under stim, 7%-12% spd buff, 5% quicker reloads, and 5% quicker weapon swaps.

Launch Pad (Ult)- 3 types of launches: 
1. Running Launch- Running on the LP will cause a normal launch 
2. Slide Launch: Sliding on the LP will cause a lower and faster launch
3. High Launch: Jumping directly on the LP will cause a higher and slower launch


Caustic:

Nox Vision (Passive)- When encased in gas, grants Caustic detailed info on subjects and teammates for ‚Äúresearch‚Äù and gives 1-3% defense boost for every 3 traps activated with a 45s reload.

Nox Gas Trap (Tactical): Improve teammates movements by 3-5%, reduce reload time by 3%, and add a light hue (same as mirage clones) for teammates to distinguish between ally and enemy gas traps.

Nox Gas Grenade (Ult)- Increase gas spreads height by 3-7%


Crypto:

Neurolink (Passive)- When drone isn‚Äôt in use, detects enemies behind you. 

Surveillance Drone (Tactical)- 40s-&gt;35s reload, 5% faster drone switch, and 5% increase drone spd in flight mode.

Drone EMP (Ult)- When drone isn‚Äôt in use, allows crypto to throw drone as a EMP bomb, and improve crypto immobility by 5%.


Revenant:

Stalker (Passive)- Increase climbing reach by 5-10% and reduce climbing sound effect by 5-7%

fsijda,Unity605,My idea for the town takeover,"If you go out now to snipers ridge near skyhook you will see the poles that signal a town takeover is coming to that region. You will also see a dead prowler (its a creature from Titanfall) and when you get close you will see bloodhounds ravens fly off from the corpse. Not only does that signal a Bloodhound town takeover happening over there (Bloodhound's Ravens+ town takeover poles= Town takeover about Bloodhound) but in the files there was a leak that said that Bloodhound town takeover teaser would start today march 31 (check Ilootgames or shrugtal's twitter for the proof of that and the rest of what I am about to say.) Now there is also animations for the prowlers in the code for Apex legends specifically. So what I think the town takeover's gimmick will be (wraith had the humongous portal, octane had the jump pad's everywhere and mirage has a ton of decoys and you can start the party) are the prowlers. When you land and as your looting this place ( I would assume it has great loot, the other ones did) you have to watch out for enemy players and the prowlers as well. Would make having a recon legend such as crypto or *bloodhound* essential to keep tabs on the many prowlers that would be roaming in the area. This would make it more of a super high risk high reward area depending on how tough the prowlers are in apex as you could possibly get third partied by the prowlers while fighting off a squad that lands with you in this zone. But that is my though on what would be cool for me to see in this town takeover.  Let's discuss what we would like to see in this new town takeover.",9,1585680052,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsijda/my_idea_for_the_town_takeover/,apexlegends,6

I've noticed the interaction time it takes to open a box or revive is longer then other interaction timers generally resulting in opening a door over reviving a downed teammate in front of the door. I understand that opening a door has no interaction timer besides the animation of the door. But it's absolutely killer when you look away from your downed teammate for a split second and interact with the door over a rez. This is a common scenario for me and gets me or my team killed more often then not. I'm certain I'm not alone in saying there are to many interaction options for the 1 binding making interactions with no timer like grabbing ammo an issue at times.

This game is brutal at times. The only other games I play are destiny and halo and recently tried out CoD warzone. All 3 of these games have a helpful thing in common, radar! 

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve gotten third parties in this game while looting and loosing matches as a result. Who knows just how many wins I‚Äôd have if when there were two other teams, I knew where the third team was before choosing to push the second team. Third partying is in fact a problem with this game that you don‚Äôt hear about in any other games... nothing has been done to address the issue either. 

I believe that either short range radar, or silencer attachments should be added to this game to resolve the third partying issue or at the least, these additions would be an attempt to solve the problem.",2,1585679170,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsi97h/i_think_we_all_have_a_love_hate_relationship_with/,apexlegends,0

So, his real name is Nick Wade his in-game name is Lurid and his nickname is The darken Madness . His abilities are Passive:Fist of Darkness which increases melee damage and blides enemys slightly, His tactical is the Blinded cast, which throws a mini granade similar to revenant but what it does is that it has a radius bigger than revenant's and deals 15-20 damage and blindes enemys and sucks anyone near its radius and the longer they stay there the more the damage and the longer they will be blinded for. Now here is the problem is that i am chosing between 3:ults so I giving you the choice. So here are them, 1: Final Chaos,He make a dark verdion of him self that does basically any other gamer does but you can give him loot from ur self but when he dies his loot goes into a deathbox and can be looted by anyone but when the original Lurid dies the dark version has 30secs to res or grab the banner. 2: Switch aruz, switches the abilities and loot of enemys with their teammate. 3: (Help me with a good name for this one) : Summons a big black hot that deals 75-100 damage and blindes the enemys but the catch here that they cant see there teammates loot and abilitys so they have to remembe. So ots you choice comment 1-2-3on which ult u think is the best. P.S.

fshwjj,bamftonio,Ultimate Fusion- Item Suggestion,"item that is non stack-able consumable that adds perks(s) to the next ultimate/current ultimate ability

*-obtainable only by neutral care packages and loot vaults.*

**(Note: this item will be super rare and only be a one time use. This won't make every ultimate fused for the character, just for one ultimate after the item is consumed.)**

*\*here are some ideas I'm just throwing out, obviously¬† some of these may be unbalanced but just to give an idea of how this item would alter character's ultimates\**

**Caustic-**

 next ultimate has an increased time for every enemy that was in the area damaged from when the Nox grenade first detonates, gas also has an infectious effect where if a teamate is exposed to the gas they will also damage any teammates they get near 5 seconds after being exposed to nox gas. (Players will be notified when infected, maybe gas would have different color)

**Lifeline-**

care package will have an extra item slot and faster drop delay and slight increased rarity chance. (fast drop could be an offensive tactic to finish off knocked enemies)

**Gibraltar-** 

Increased active time and ricochet passive on dome shield where incoming bullets would bounce off the dome shield and have a chance to hit players in the area of gunfight.

**Bloodhound-** 

next ultimate will grant teammates to see a single enemy as thermal vision that bloodhound successful pings while his ultimate is active, players must be within a certain distance of bloodhound to see his ""blood ping"".

**Wraith-**

 her next portal will have an increased distance and both enemy and friendly players can shoot bullets through the portal that do less than normal damage dealt (bullets won't damage players while traveling thru portal)

**Mirage-** 

next decoy escape also grants decoys with slight health before vanishing. Allowing the decoys to shoot blanks back towards incoming fire from enemies that doesn't do damage for that extra bamboozle.

**Wattson-** 

next ultimate placed will grant both teammates and enemies that are shooting while standing in the area of her ultimate a chance for a bullet to stun an enemy they hit (similar effect to fence damage when walking through)

**Crypto-**

 next ultimate will grant his drone emp an abiltity that slightly pulls enemies in the affected area in the direction of the drone as the pulse explodes. This is a slight buff that could be used to pull enemies off ledges and also expose them while they're hiding behind cover.

**Bangalore-** 

her next ultimate leaves behind trip mines that detonate when enemies walk over them. (Not sure how visible they would be or distance spread out) but the trip mines will stay behind and active as long as her squad is not eliminated. (Yes they will be detected by crypto drone and bloodhound scan)

**Pathfinder-**

 single stealth ultimate zip-line that doesn't make sound when deployed or used by players, when players use zip-line once it will heal 25-50 shield after 1 use. (This shield heal passive can only be used once and won't grant shield health if used again.)

**Octane**\- next jump pad will grant increased distance/height when used, also ability to throw grenades and they will fly bounce off, after use players have a stim movement speed for a few seconds after landing from the the pad.

**Reverent-** (cant think of anything yet)

**this item isn't really meant to be game changing. just a little spice to the gameplay like EVO shields. possibly this can be an LTM mode.**

this is an urgent call from the EU community. We have been plagued by server issues for at least a FULL WEEK now. Those always occur starting at 5pm local european time and last long into the night.

most of the reports are made from the FIFA but Im pretty sure the Apex Legends servers share the same datacenters and servers.

swapping to Frankfurt1, Frankfurt2, Belgium 1,2,3 or Amsterdam all yield the same issues:

- you either cant login

- if you get in and into a lobby, creating a party either takes forever or does not work at all. ""all party members must be lv10 or higher""-loadbug occurs and ranked cant be played even though everyone meets specifications

- 1 or 2 players connect into a game while the rest is still in the lobby creating 2 player games

fshha7,GarPak,Time to get out your tinfoil hats...,"Over the last week, I've seen a lot of people mention the underwhelming loot pool on King's Canyon, increased amount of third partying from other times we've played KC, perhaps increased gunshot sounds on KC, and a difficulty getting out of lower ranks due to good players being low ranked. First game me and the boys played in ranked, my friend said, ""It sounds like they upped gunshot audio"". Since then, I've noticed it too. I've played since launch day, and this KC is not the one I remember. It seems what could be going on is that, with increased audio and decreased loot, third partying is through the roof. This leads obviously to less consistent match outcomes for good players due to the fact that even high skill players often cannot overcome the chaos that party after party brings. This may be keeping good players stuck at lower ranks with only the best of the best able to get out of Diamond or even Plat not because the rest of the players aren't good enough to be plat, diamond, GM, etc., but because there is just so much randomness to overcome with adding on so many teams to a fight. I haven't seen a single Grand Master ranked player since ranked started. I have seen plenty of plat, diamond, and predators though. Maybe this is because there aren't enough people above diamond to fill up predator AND then add to GM rank. Surely, this eventually will change as the split goes on since we are only 1 week in, but still, I can't help but think that maybe this isn't just a normal case of a new ranked split. That leads me to my tin foil theory. Here it goes...

WHAT IF the dev team doesn't want King's Canyon around as much as all of the players have. What if they really want to keep working with World's Edge or perhaps other maps in development without looking backwards to KC constantly, and because of this, they changed some of the variables in KC ranked such as gunshot audio with the intent to increase third partying and decrease the fun experience of KC in order to turn player loyalty against the map. This may sound a little nuts or overly petty, but the player base, in a chorus, was demanding KC back to the point where the dev team really had to respond some way. If I am a dev and we have plans for maps other than KC but can't get the player base to accept them because of their desire for an old map, what better way to achieve the freedom from KC than to eliminate the player base's desire to play it? Additionally, they have left World's Edge in there in casual just to make sure people can run back to WE while the split goes on to keep it fresh in their minds and to juxtapose it with the less-fun experience KC has to offer right now. Before this ranked split, in so many posts and comments on reddit, KC was the near-unanimous favorite, but in just one week of KC ranked, there seems to have been (from what I've seen) a shift of loyalty to WE. And wouldn't this just be working out really nicely for the devs and their PR team if their vision for the game moving forward did not include KC? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

To be clear, I'm not saying that I all-out believe this, but its interesting to make the puzzle pieces fit. And since we're all isolated, why not let the mind run wild, eh? Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy! 

Tl;dr What if the dev team is intentionally tanking KC (through changed variables on KC with the intent to drive up third partying and drive down fun) in order to turn the player base's loyalty against KC so that they can focus on the projects on other maps that they would rather work on?",4,1585676758,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fshha7/time_to_get_out_your_tinfoil_hats/,apexlegends,0

My theory is prowlers have found a way into Worlds Edge. Like Flyers, they will make home to many locations and will be found wandering the map no matter where you are. The catch? They will attack you if you get too close. World's Edge is full of places you can climb up onto, buildings to shelter in, and also lots of open space to be caught off guard. I reckon these beasts won't have a ton of health (probably less than 100) and they will throw a wrench in the games for people who carelessly run through open fields.",14,1585676032,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsh98r/theory_with_this_bloodhound_town_takeover/,apexlegends,4

fsh5cb,monophobe,Everyone Gets a Hop Up! An effort to give every weapon in the game a viable and balanced upgrade [OC],"**Preamble**

The other day I was watching famed Apex player BackOffMyJankz and he had mentioned how he would love to see the game reach a point where every gun in the game had a hop up. My wheels have been turning thinking about possibilities since, and I‚Äôve finally put some ideas to paper and I‚Äôd be curious as to what the general populous thinks. 

**Naked Guns**

This is probably an unnecessary addition but I figured for the sake of clarity I‚Äôd just list the guns that are left without a hop up at this stage of the game. So the list of ‚Äúnaked‚Äù guns is as follows:
- R99
- Alternator
- RE45
- Hemlok
- Spitfire
- Wingman
- LSTAR
- Longbow
- Charge Rifle 
- Sentinel

**Return to the Ring**

A couple classics are going to be making a comeback but not without some tweaks to try and sustain the balance within the game. 

Disruptor Rounds: RE45, Alternator
- Does additional shield damage upon contact with enemy 
- 1.40 multiplier for both, down from the previous 1.7 for the RE45 and 1.55 for the Alternator
- Epic/purple availability

Skullpiercer: Longbow, Wingman
- Bringing back an old favorite, Skullpiercer rounds make a return to glory without any changes to their multipliers
- 2.5 multiplier for Longbow, 2.25 for the Wingman
- Legendary/gold availability

**A New Challenger Has Approached**

Alright so we‚Äôve finally reached the new ‚Äúadditions‚Äù to the Apex loot pool, please feel free to critique or compliment the following concepts as they‚Äôre definitely a bit experimental. 

Pacemakers: Hemlok, LSTAR
- At first glance these two guns could not be more different, with the LSTAR being great for close quarters and the Hemlok have great power at medium range
- Both guns are rather one dimensional, so the Pacemakers aim to increase both guns‚Äô versatility by adjusting their fire rates
- Hemlok: Goes from 3 round burst to a 6 round burst, excellent in close quarters with the potential for crazy damage if you group the shots well enough (eats through ammo though)
- LSTAR: Instead of long winded chains of energy ammo raining down on your opponent, the Pacemaker gives the LSTAR the option of a 3 round burst to extend its‚Äô range to more medium distance fights 
- Epic/Purple availability

Corrosive Agent: Charge Rifle, Sentinel
- This was definitely the one I had the hardest time making viable, as the Charge Rifle as a whole poses balance issues that make it a tricky gun to enhance
- What I decided on is a hop up called Corrosive Agent, a 1.25 damage multiplier that takes away from flesh health
- ex: Sentinel hits for 70 body, so with Corrosive Agent an additional 18 damage is inflicted to their flesh health 
- The addition of this hop up warrants the removal of the Disruptor function from the Sentinel as well as any slowing effect the Charge Rifle still has intact
- Epic/purple availability

Buzzer Bullets or Buzzers: R99, Spitfire
- The moment you‚Äôve all been waiting for, the R99 gets a hop up
- Buzzers do electrical chain damage, connecting with additional enemies within 2 meters of your original point of impact
- 1.4 base multiplier for the R99, resulting in max 38 damage done to enemies in range
- 1.2 base multiplier for Spitfire, resulting in max 66 damage done to enemies in range
- Every headshot adds .10 to base multiplier, so 1.4 becomes 1.5 and so on 
- The effect/look of the hop up will be similar to an Arc Star or Wattson fence, but it will not slow or blur vision 
- Legendary/gold availability 

Alrighty that is it for the new hop ups, let me know if you guys have any balance or meta issues or just general concerns. I really think all of these are viable in game and add new elements that make things a hell of a lot more interesting.",5,1585675700,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsh5cb/everyone_gets_a_hop_up_an_effort_to_give_every/,apexlegends,1

fsgc5s,TheTyGoss,"There are some unofficial ""rules"" of Apex teamwork. Like whoever shoots down a cargo bot gets first dibs on the loot. Well a question came up during a match today regarding one of those rules, and I'd like to get the subreddit's opinion on it.","The following situation arose in a match today: I was having a great game, had 6 kills &amp; was the kill leader. Well we had just defeated a squad, I had done 98% of the damage to this guy with a gold shield, and then our octane took a single shot, and killed him, finishing off the squad.

Immediately the octane grabbed the gold shield. Then (and I found this hilarious since I wasn't even involved in the argument), the wraith and octane on my team started arguing over who should get the shield. The wraith argued that since I was essentially ""carrying"" the team, that I got first dibs on the gold shield. The octane said ""well I killed him, so I get it"".

So what's the unofficial rule of Apex teamwork? Does the carrying member of the team get the best loot every time, or the guy who technically got the kill even if they hardly did anything?",34,1585673134,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsgc5s/there_are_some_unofficial_rules_of_apex_teamwork/,apexlegends,5

fsg4uf,lil_lysol,So much wasted potential in the pass,"I looked through the pass and maybe im wrong but some guns dont have very many legendary pass skins or even purple ones just tons of blues for no good reason.

Take the p2020 for example, i dont remember any purple or gold skins in the pass but hey atleast we got some blue charge rifle and flatline skins amirite.

The pass needs some cleanup like less skins or no skins for skins at tier 100 or the charge rifle at 98 i think. Its just dumb and i know not everyone reaches that high but why not save those for the next passes and spend more time making other/better skins for things like the p2020 or the spitfire hell even the sentinel or triple take need some love next pass hopefully.

This game is still somewhat fresh to where its not at that point where all legendaries have been given out for every gun but i hope it reaches there at season 5 just putting in
 good skins in the pass or more handouts from the event.

Also i would LOVE a bigger shop or a faster rotating one its so slow right now I'll never have to choose if i want one thing or another cause I'll have saved up on it by then",7,1585672471,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsg4uf/so_much_wasted_potential_in_the_pass/,apexlegends,2

2)Tactical: Mirage doesn't really need a buff in his tactical. His tactical is disorienting at times and it also recharges fast.

fseuhi,Dedmisk,Character Idea!,"Name: Wildcard

Passive (Draw): You gain resistances against all grenades. The passive cycles the 3 resistances, stopping randomly, giving you the resistance listed below for 10 seconds and quickly cycling again after the 10 seconds is up. Ability can be altered by secondary passive.

+ Arc Star - Immune to the slow from arc stars
+ Frag - Reduced explosive damage taken
+ Thermite - DoT damage reduced by 15%

Secondary Passive (Alteration): Abilities can be altered by meeting certain requirements. Requirements differ between legends and their abilities. Requirements listed below.

+ Carrying multiple of one type of grenade in your inventory alteres Wildcards abilities toward that grenade type and resistance listed in the primary passive. Otherwise, all abilities remain randomized as listed.

Tactical (Slight of Hand): You throw a grenade, this grenade has a chance to be an Arc Star, Thermite, or Frag grenade. Ability can be altered by secondary passive.

+ Slight of Hand has a 20 second cooldown, as it allows you to save inventory space due to not needing to pick up as many grenades.

Ultimate (Ace in the hole): Wildcard throws a handful of grenades into the air above him, littering the area around him with arc Stars, thermite grenades, and frags. You're not immune to these grenades, but gain all passive resistances for 20 seconds. Ability can be altered by secondary passive. 

+ Ultimate has a 2 minute cooldown, this is due to the higher risk of using it, but it can be used as an escape or a tool for being aggressive, you decide.

Obviously the skill damage/cooldowns, as well as the RNG aspect could definitely use tweaking based off the actual in-game values and gameplay.",0,1585668300,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fseuhi/character_idea/,apexlegends,0

fsecqs,ajahajahs,The community do not actually need Solos or Duos mode to remain competitive in BR,"It is season 4 already and there are SERIOUS pain points since Season 1 which were not addressed. That is Solos or Duos: Some players have been requesting for solos and duos for a very long time and it is not that they want to play solos or duos. The fact that players were requesting for solos and duos is because they have do not have a full team (friends of 3). Without a full squad of three friends playing together, it gives them a HUGE disadvantage to players who have a full team:

1. No Communication: Friends who play with each other tend to use discord for communication so they have an upper hand when coordinating in the game. While Apex also do have ingame communication, solos rarely use it. Hence, it lacks the teamwork which is a very important factor in the game. This solution can be quite simple. In a highly team-based game like Overwatch also encounters the same complexity in balancing. In fact, they didn't even introduce solos/duo mode. What they introduced was matching single players and 2-players in the same matches. When all the solos are matched together (60 teams of solos) and  duos are matched together (60 teams of solos) besides the other skills/rank based factors, it eliminates the strong need for communication if they are not paired with a full 3-player teams. Apex would then stand a higher chance of player retention for Solos and Duos player. Instead of addressing this, they prioritised SBMM which further discourages the community for solos or 2 player teams because the 3-player teams have a much higher chance of winning battles. This may cause some single players to resort to cheating and it makes the community much more worse.
2. Character selection: single players are unable to select their preferred character (which is frequently pathfinder or wraith). To be able to select the players that they want to play, it is purely based on a first-come-first served basis. The issue with some players who is not able to select the character that they want is that they simply just quit the match. The devs can run a statistics on the number of players leaving the first 3 minutes in the game (exclude players who lost connection). This problem ruin the community and damages the player population. In a role-based game like LOL, it also has the same problem. What they simply introduced was the role-based matching (at least for rank). For players who want to play Top, they will be matched with other players for other roles such as mid and bottom and support to form a team. This will allow the teams to be paired evenly together to form a full team. Instead of addressing this problem, they introduced tougher penalties against players who rage quit. This even further discourages solos or duos community to continue playing the game.

Apex has alot of potential and I like Apex Legends but if the devs dont acknowledge these problems and work on them quickly, i am afraid the only community left are the players who have a full team of 3-players.",5,1585666679,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsecqs/the_community_do_not_actually_need_solos_or_duos/,apexlegends,1

fsdw1y,battlerumdam,Left at Start of Season 3 due to terrible performance - did it get better?,"So, basically the title. I started this game when it launched, I ignored all the problems it had because it was a new game.

Season 1 happened, not really anything better. Ranked appeared, which comes with huge problems. So now a few problem I hope are somehow fixed and make this game worth again.

* ""Ranked"" 
   * Was just a hiding simulator due to missing SBMM and a stupid ""win points with hiding"" system. Is it still like this?
   * Did they implement actual SBMM which makes it impossible for real bronze players to reach diamond again?
   * Does ranked still have 90% instant quitters?
* Perfomance wise the game is a joke
   * Mouse polling rate of 1000 caused input lag. Is it still a problem? Mouse input lag was a known probllem without real fixes
   * Mouse movement wasn't ""snappy"" and felt ""sluggish"" &amp; choppy most of the time (nothing like the smooth Overwatch experience)
   * Even on lowest settings with decent hardware the game has lag and is hard to play sometimes - FPS maintain over 100
   * Terrible hitreg

So this were just a few from the problems. Comparing the gunplay to Titanfall 2 (The game which was the base for this) or even CoD MW is impossible. Both TF and CoD have really smooth nice gunplay.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope the game got anything better because it actually was a lot of fun.",5,1585665014,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsdw1y/left_at_start_of_season_3_due_to_terrible/,apexlegends,0

fsdtis,smucker89,List of bugs I‚Äôve noticed are picking up bloodhound for only a week:,"
- if you get downed in his ult and rezzed, even if your ult is still active some people won‚Äôt show up red (so it‚Äôs just grey on grey!)

- if you use your recon tactical but something pops up (ie ring closing) it won‚Äôt show the amount of hostiles nearby

- I‚Äôve used my tactical, it has said no hostiles nearby, and a caustic immediately comes out from behind a wall and blasts off my head. Something is seriously bugged with the bloodhound tactical as it is NOT a large ring as it seems, since 4/5 times it only scans things in front of you. Either it‚Äôs visual effect needs to be fixed to represent this, or the ability itself. 

- the obvious screen being grey if you die in ult (hate that I say it‚Äôs obvious but this is the one that I see everyone talk about, respawn wtf).

- also this is more a quality of life problem, but why tf does say traps are enemies? I love that they get scanned, but in the heat of a fight it‚Äôs very frustrating to see that 5 enemies appear but four of them are oddly placed Watson pylons that don‚Äôt connect

And that‚Äôs I remember off the top of my head, and that‚Äôs only after playing him for a week and having less that 80 games played with him. He feels so good to play, until you hit bug after bug/ poor game design. His kit workers beautifully until you start hitting bugs or frustrating moments like the ones listed above.

""Ye lets give him that and call it a day.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Lifeline:**

Rez shield + fast rez + Free loots  


**Gib:**

Shield arm shield for dueling  
His cancer dome for defense

His ult is Bangalore but faster.

  
**Bang:**

Smoke + speed for cheeky escapes  
Ult is dope for forcing.

**Caustic:**  
Perma blind + slow + DoT. Free Bulletshield with Gas sack.  


**Wraith:** 

portal is utility and her void run is sweet for escape.

  
**Path:**   
is dope with his mobility thanks to grapple + zipline is just all-round utility.

&amp;#x200B;

**Then we look at the rejects, who didn't get the same love.**  
**Octane**:  
 His stim is just a trashy version of wraiths void run and costs health. Instead of making it not cost health, he sacrifices his passive for the fix, literally.  
For someone all about mobility, pathfinder swings rings around him. His jump pad? Less useful Zipline.  


**Mirage:**

 He uh, tricks people and they sometimes waste a bullet on his decoy. oops.  He can test for snipers.. but so can Wraith. For free.   
His ult is good, except that he can't do anything while stealth. It might be useful if you could reload or heal given his kit has nothing else going for him. Maybe if he had a real kit, he might not need a passive when he dies?  


  
**Crypto:**

Pros: His ult 

Con: Everything else

&amp;#x200B;

Just not sure why we look at tweaking things like Gibs arm when there are champs that just bleed utility and others that might as well be straight from CoD.",13,1585654833,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsbfbe/i_dont_understand_the_major_imbalance/,apexlegends,1

Please feel free to leave feedback on what you guys think. I tried to make them balanced but if someone has anything to add to make it more balanced is love to hear it. 


* The Morning Star
Maddock Penrose  

Passive: fire walk
Can walk on lava without taking damage and takes half damage from thermite grenades.

Tactical: Molotov 
Toss a Molotov cocktail that burns similar to the thermite grenade but it the AOE can stick to walls, ceilings, and more. (45 seconds to charge)

Ultimate: flamethrower
Pull out a heavy flamethrower capable of heating up to over 1000‚ÄôF. Melt the combatants or anything else in your way.The heavy flamethrower burns similar to a thermite grenade. 1000 mag size, 10 RPS, 125 DPS. (3 minutes to charge)

* Emergency reinforcement
Shadi 

Passive: Auto Ping Systems (APS)
Keeping your aim on someone for more than 10 seconds will automatically ping them for your team to see (within 200 meters). You can also shoot them to ping them (any distance). 5 second refresh rate.

Tactical: blitzkrieg
Reload time decreased by 25% and weapon swap decreased by 50% for 30 seconds. (1 minute to charge) 

Ultimate: call in a auto piloted Titian to fight on your side for 45 seconds. Will attack any pinged enemy as long as they are within 200 meters. Falls in like a care package for anyone to claim (5 minutes to charge)
 
* Transfusion specialist 
Damon

Passive: blood lust
Restore 25 HP for killing an enemy and 100 HP for finishing an enemy

Tactical: self sacrifice 
Sacrifice some health (25HP) to help heal one of your squad mates (35HP). (30 seconds to charge. Last 4 seconds to activate) 

Ultimate: vampire grenade 
Throw a grenade that deals 65 damage to anyone caught in the blast and returns that health to everyone in your squad equally.  (2 minutes to charge) 


* The huntsman 
Geoffrey Obson 

Passive: see enemy footsteps for 5 seconds 

Tactical: bear traps
Deploy up to 3 bear traps that when triggered Traps a legend for up to 10 seconds or they get set free by a teammate. Does 15 damage when trap is set off. Highlights trapped legends.  (15 seconds to charge) 

Ultimate: bow and arrows
Shoot and arrow with a flare on it in the direction/at the enemy and call in a arrow storm. Covers and area the size of rolling thunder but  the arrow storm only last 10 seconds. Each arrow does 5 damage (2.5 minutes to charge) 


If you got this far thank you for taking the time to look at my crazy ideas. Also, with the ultimate on the huntsman I don‚Äôt know how many arrows there would be. I figured that it would work kinda like rolling thunder for Bangalore but a much tighter spread than the missiles and work more like a wave instead of going side to side in each row.

Started to get into it on my own and the toxicity at times is really annoying, but I can manage and I know it's the internet. 

However, today I had a case of two premates who just flamed me right from the start. One of them was the jumpmaster and I asked if he could please ping, so I know where we are going. His response was ""Pig"". I thought it was a typo and said ""Thanks"". Which apparently invited them to just start flaming me, because ""HAHA YOU SAID THANKS, STUPID PIG"" the whole freaking round. And since it was ranked, I was unable to leave. 

They obviously played like shit with one of them doing 0 dmg the whole time and both of them dying first. Almost killed the squad who got us, but thanks to just spamming toxic stuff in chat, it got super distracting.

fsa9bv,Too_Practical,How to Fix Ranked KC,"Currently, as we all try to figure this new ranked split out, KC for ranked is quite frustrating. Getting into fights is a death sentence for 3rd parties, and camping to the end with 0 points is gambling on a circle to land on you. You can play it safe and stick to 3rd parties, but 4th and 5th parties are frequent and frustrating. You can avoid fighting all together and make it to late game with 0 points, but the circle will more than likely end in the middle of nowhere with 0 cover so you'll be rotating into the open with 5 other squads. It feels like KC accentuates the RNG aspect of battle royales. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Loot Distribution**

\-Increase amount of loot spawns and concentration of loot per spawn area. 

You have to run from one side of the building to the other just to pick up 2 items, and good luck if they're anything above common tier. You can also mow down 3 squads and still be starved for shields and meds at the end of it.

**Ending Circles**

\-Place ending circles in places with multiple points of cover 

Right now, circles end in an entirely open area or they end on a building in an entirely open area. If you're not blessed with the circle you're running out into the open with 18 other people, and it becomes an RNG fest of who doesn't shoot who or who does. The beauty of WE is that most of the ending circles had spots you can play from.

**3rd-5th Partying**

\-Reduce gun firing volume to 200m

Really no other realistic way to staunch 3rd partying other than making the map bigger (WE). The beauty of KC is that its open and accessible, which is great for pubs but frustrating when you try to balance skill. Starting a fight in KC is a dog whistle for the 5 teams around you, and its small enough that if you are the 3rd party that's still enough time for a 4th and 5th party to rotate towards your shots. 200m coincides with Crypto's drone banner, so its a number that makes sense. I haven't tested it but I could hear fighting at the top of Hillside Outpost from Bunker.",2,1585648887,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fsa9bv/how_to_fix_ranked_kc/,apexlegends,1

fs9ucb,patuzao,Balace ideas from a casual,"I dont play much rank but i get the overall opnion of the community so here it is my humble opnion

For me if a legend its not strong he must be fun some legends will never be meta but well lets make them fun atleast

Octane:Make him the faster legend in the game everything about him is about speed,Double Jump (Pad) pls respawn thats would give octane more vertical and horizontal power and t just make the passive to keep up with the damage taken by the stim idk the damage taken by the stim is healed more faster see how this would do

Ravenamt:This Edgy Boi need a buff first of all when you get teleport back you can glitch in to the wall and spawn in very strange spots fix that and the hitbox or just take away low profile of him,Make him climb more and faster and the tactical make it have a large radius and have more damage like 15 or 20 and a longer visual blur to scare more the enemy, Also make he go back with 30 hp instead of 1

Mirage:His tactical is ok,The ult is good but could be better make mirage go invis and have like 2 or 3 charges of hologram that would have lower cooldown and make that he could heal while invis and the passive make it spawn 2 clones that mirror your movement 

Crypto: I think his good but could be more fun make that the pem could be used by the drone or thrown like a grenade but would have a smaller radius and give him a better passive Make the atual passive just to be part of the drone

Lifeline:She's Good but gibby stole her kit nerf gibby his already got HECKIN 6 SKILLS

I would like to start a discussion regarding fighting against cheaters in Apex legends. A lot of players stopped playing the game cause of cheaters. The main reason for the players' discontent is that a lot of cheaters haven\`t been punished for a long period of time. It\`s a very frequent situation to find a cheater with 500 player\`s level, or even with predator badge.

So could you please bring some explanation for us what is your plan for fighting cheaters, why the fight is so ineffective right now? I can see that we have a lack of information from your side regarding this situation and that leads players to leave the game.

I really love this game and I don\`t want it to die cause of cheaters.  Please do more to ban and get rid of cheaters.

I'd love to be able to test out the visuals in a controlled environment so that I don't have to search for that specific gun relentlessly and then try to get an amazing game with it (potentially to the detriment of my team because it encourages thirsting and idling to examine it afterwards.) I'm not a programmer or anything, but I assume it doesn't work because dummies aren't programmed as kills to avoid bugs/exploits related to challenges/trackers or something? If not, or if there's a work-around for that, I'd love it to be implemented.

fs8x5k,I_Am_Hibbert,Recently started playing again. A couple of questions.,"Hello guardians,

I recently downloaded and started playing again thanks to lockdown. Slowly working my way up to the power level cap on my titan and I have a couple of questions. 

I havent played since way back when (crota raid iirc) and notice that infusion has changed somewhat. What's the consensus on this now? Are upgrade cores (not sure if thats their correct name) easy to come by? Should I actively be infusing my preferred weapons and armour before I reach 1000 power or should I just use whatever I'm lucky enough to come across until that point?

Also, I'm a f2p low life atm. What's considered the real end game content for f2p these days? 

Any other general pieces of advice/tips etc would be greatly appreciated as I ploughed a lot of time into this game initially and wouldnt mind becoming invested in it once more, but I feel somewhat out of the loop.

Thanks in advance!",0,1585641569,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fs8x5k/recently_started_playing_again_a_couple_of/,apexlegends,1

fs8rir,Druid4life21,This is starting to get ridiculous.,"I don't know if it's a bug or the servers, but something needs to be done. It feels like every second game it lags out and is completely unplayable.

There is NO audio, not even in the slightest and then my frames drop and spike and drop and spike, then the game begins to freeze and unfreeze.

Then it will run perfectly smooth, then you get into a fight and the moment someone shoots it freezes.

Well, maybe it's just you're PC? No. Do you want to know how I know? Because when it does this a little symbol shows up in the top right corner. It shows up every time I lag like this. 

I can also say it's not my PC because I bought it 8 months ago it's practically brand new.

fs8ph0,ExtremelyAverageBman,My New Idea For A Support Legend,"Now I know that my photo shop skill are trash, but this is my new idea for another support legend. I also don't have a name or art drawings of this legend but that is where I need your help.

So.

The passive perk is a team health regeneration at 2hp every 5 seconds Note: you don't regenerate health just your teammates 

The Tactical Perk is a instant 20hp heal to standing players just aim and fire, if not careful you can accidentally heal enemies this has the same affect as splash damage so make sure you aim carefully. note: this has no affect on knocked teammates at a distance. The second part to this perk is the reviving part. For this you ""have to"" hit your teammate and be no more than 1 meter away from them if you step away the revive stops and you have to shoot them again. this will free up your hands to defend but at the cost of a slower revive. The cool-down is 45 sec

Now the Ultimate. This perk lays down a green circle 8 meters in diameter for 25 seconds, with in this circle you ""and only you"" can shoot your teammates to heal them at a rate of 2hp per shot. This is the only time that you are given health regeneration at 3hp every 4 seconds and a healing boost 20%.     The cool-down rate on this is 200 seconds.

For the low profile I decide to try something new. I think give this legend the ability to gain 10 health for every 150 damage they do would be really interesting. What do you think?

fs8nwn,habegarrison,Cool caustic buff maybe!,"Just thinking of a few ideas for his ultimate to get a tiny buff, as a caustic main I do believe his ult is the most underpowered piece of his kit and I believe I've thought of a cool buff for his ult. 

So I had this thought when I threw his ult in those tiny back sections of the long buildings and there was a team hiding in the sides and top that didn't get affected just because they were a tiny bit higher, so It got me thinking. How could would it be if his gas just filled a room. Like you throw it and whatever room your in it just fills it all the way, the bigger the room the more gas there is. I think this would be really cool and kind of more realistic, obviously if your in the open then its just an AOE which also should be a bit bigger but just thought I'd share my opinion! (Also just increase the ult damage to 10 per second plz respawn) !

Ive seen some have touched on this subject, some worse off then others, but is this really annoying bug not going to stop ? Is there something I can do ? Are you doing something ? I am not being unreasonable, I do not expect you to check all games or even refund the lost points to all who loose them,if you answered this, point me in the right direction.

Really, I dont mind the occasional lag, the cheaters, the bugs here and there and general randomness, I get it, its coding, srvers, hax ++ I mean a lot can go wrong in the digital world. (i lied, h8 the cheaters)

Gaming for 20 min, securing another win, chasing the kills and assists, even just now a normal warmup round, completing dailys+weeklys, 2 manned the win, 5+ cant remember how many kills and then ........ nothing !

Placement 20, no kills, no win (the dailys and weeklys also didnt count) or worse, thank you for playing ranked, your win and full points gets you MINUS 36.

If you start adding up the games, only happens to wins, the hours stack up with 20 min ish a game, nvm the fact the +189 ranked turned into a negative -225 you need to chase to get back.

I remember posting about this happening to me in ranked, now its apperently random in both modes. The fantastic respons was a random dude typing a nonsense comment.

fs58uq,The_Forbidden_Reddit,Developer Request: Mozambique Changes,"Can you do one of the following:  


1. Make the Mozambique shoot faster.  

2. Give the Mozambique have a bigger magazine.  

3. Increase the Mozambique damage, because it a pistol that is a shotgun.  


If you give the Mozambique a faster fire rate at least with the 'shotgun bolt level 3'; then we the player can actually have a chance to kill our opponent at the speed of shooting our entire 3 shot magazine, that does 45 damage per shot, with each pellet doing 15 damage, for a total 135 damage which is around Peacekeeper range except we got to reload the entire magazine. However you could also give the Mozambique a large magazine of 6; to let the player kill the opponent in 5/6 of the magazine which is around 75% or more of the magazine that most weapons require to kill an opponent who has purple armor and I am sure no one would complain about early kills when you can find a Peacekeeper (1-shot kill) or Prowler (2-Burst Kill) or even and RE-45 (still kill in less a second) which all kill in less than a second granted the player does not miss. Yet, you could also instead increase the damage of the Mozambique to 75 damage at least, but I do not like the idea of increasing the damage of the Mozambique because you would then have the increase the damage of the EVA-08 which is another story which has nothing to do with the Mozambique.  


I am aware of Hammerpoint Rounds when my teammates are not cursing me out when they die for running off.  


However, every pistol in the game kills in a full magazine, then every pistol can deal 200+ damage in a full magazine except the P2020 which is not a 'pistol' that is also a 'shotgun'. I already know that you the developer will have to consider this yourself if you find it worth testing, then you will have to deal your community who play the game, then you got to consider the programming and the fact that you already have Hammerpoints rounds which for all intents and purposes could be more complicated because it literally doubles your damage (unless something has changed since then) so I know that if you decide there is a lot to consider.  


At the end of day; I walk in a building with Mozambique, a Pistol that is also a shotgun. I have 3 rounds in my magazine before I reload and I do not have ""Sleight of Hand"" or ""Drop Magazine (which would be amazing)"". Each round does 45 damage damage, and if I miss one shot I can't drop my enemy.  


Last words: Watch my Karma drop, and read the comment section. I am already at -5 and I don't know if that is from the Vegan subreddit or Apex Legends or Warframe, but it's all the same because I get the same results. I think you will find something interesting between the correlation of comments, karma, and all of my posts.",7,1585624075,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fs58uq/developer_request_mozambique_changes/,apexlegends,1

fs4tws,Vid30Gam3Guy69,Loss Forgiveness in Ranked,"Respawn needs to improve the loss forgiveness system in ranked. My issue with it is that if you get into a game without teammates, it doesn't give you any loss forgiveness, which shouldn't be the case at all. This is the second game today that I spawn in without teammates and obviously got demolished because of the lack of a team. Since I'm playing in gold and had two back to back games without teammates, I lost 48 RP, which is a lot, especially in the later ranks. This isn't solos, Respawn, this is ranked, the mode where a team is needed to get far in the game. And I know that sometimes it's not their fault if people get into solo ranked games, but what IS their fault is that the game doesn't give you any loss forgiveness for playing solo in a ranked game. Respawn needs to add loss forgiveness for games where you don't spawn in with any teammates because this is just unacceptable.

fs3wdg,Riot0711,Idea for a companion app,"I feel I got a neat idea for a companion app, that would be lore friendly, and extremely useful.

¬†

The drop ship dorm - as shown in the meltdown season trailer each legend has a personal space in the drop ship. The user of this app would be view a drop ship for there personal games from this menu the user can do a list of things

1. Select there personal roster - this would be there personal dream team so that if they leave there controller/go afk while they r waiting to drop they don't get a legend they wouldn't wanna play via a pick 3 system.

2. Select a legend to customize/view stats of - this one is kinda self explanatory.

3. View the games regulated stats in the armory - this would be a catalog of all weapons/items along with there stats and what there effects are on specific legends allowing players to see the exact effect of say the golden golden helmet on any particular legend.

4. Outlands TV feed - a news feed for everything apex such as patch notes new trailers etc...

5. Team stats page - view universal account stats, this would likely be in the personal roster menu

6. Games map - a list of all maps current and otherwise available to view with high rarity loot lolcations marked in purple and others in blue (not of the match your in this would be things like bunker).

7. Weekly fantasy match - a weekly fantasy game you can bet legend tokens on to get crafting materials/possibly apex packs. This would allow players to bet legend tokens by 10000:100 for crafting materials with the match being updated in the feed should your team place 15+ no reward, 14 - 11 = 15 material, 10 - 6 = 30 material, 5 - 4 = 200 material, 3 - 2 = 300, 1 = 300 material but if you bet 40000 it gives you 50 heirloom shards otherwise all rewards are multiplied by 1 for every extra 10000 bet on that team. You may bet on multiple. Up to a max of 100000 legend tokens per week 50000 per team. Also there would only be 2 days to place bets while the match goes over the course of 5 days.

fs1ro9,HumanObscurity,Changes and balancing to some legends,"TO CLARIFY: I have been playing Apex legends since the Beta and have clocked up about 600 hours or so on the game, reaching Predator once in season 2, I know the mechanics and the legends quite well and feel as if some of these changes are necessary in a team based shooter.

Right, so I think we can all agree that certain legends in the game fell quite under/overpowered or they complement a selfish playstyle -üòëLooking at you Mirageüòë- I propose a few changes and balances to these characters.
Mirage:
Decoy- The decoy is random chosen from one of the legends one your squad or the Decoy fires a few blank bullets when running in a certain range of an enemy. 
Vanishing act: When within range of squad, a decoy version of your squad is send out and fires blanks at enimes, while making your squad invisible for a few seconds. Increase the ultimate charge time by a good bit(by about 18% give or take)

I feel like these changes to Mirage could make him a ""Play with your food"" kind of character which I fell would not only introduce a new way to play Mirage, but make for some interesting team compositions and plays to complement the new Mirage.

Bangalore:
Double time: Change this completely, make her passive work with her tactical more, I think something along the lines of, while in her smoke, healing items, resurrection and sprinting makes less noise, nothing crazy, but just enough to make her smoke a real getaway tool. Maybe keep some of speed when she is shoot but decrease it by a small amount.

Airstrike:
Before casting the ultimate, the area is covered in smoke, then the missiles come down, this makes it so that if your enemy doesn't know the map, they will suffer for that, this also makes it stand out more than just Gibraltar's ultimate with a timer.

These changes are here to make Bangalore a getaway artist, the passive tied with her ultimate are made to make the enimes panic while you run away or, find a better position then take out the squad.

Wraith:
Into the Void: I honestly think that this ability is the strongest one in game, but rather than increasing the cooldown, decrease its uptime, just by a small bit ~0.5 - 1 second and bring its cooldown back down a little bit to compensate.

Portal: Just a quality of life change, make it so that when the Portals timer ends while the portal is to high for a downed player to crawl into the portals timer is extended just enough for the wraith to touchdown, this is so that Portals aren't places half a centimetre to high and downed players can access them without a problem, I feel like this could be a better change for newer players since they don't quite know the game yet and that portal could be their saving grace.

This is to make her Ultimate is that much more available for newer players, while making her tactical take a little more timing to use in a gunfight just incase she needs to reposition multiple times in a single fight.

Octane:
Stim: Change speed gained from 30% to 40% and decrease the time it lasts for from 6 seconds to 5 seconds, this is to make Octane feel better in those close range fights, but make his tactical a little more skillful to use because you will be using stim more often to get its boost.

Jump Pad:
Add more movement after jumping on the jump pad and also make it so that sliding, jumping, running and walking onto the jump pad, provide diffrent trajectories. This is so that you are not just flying in a predictable, uncontrollable motion after launching off of it.

This makes Octane feel somewhat closer to what Stim did in Titanfall.

Wattson:
Electric Fence:
Increase the damage of the fence OR decrease the cool down by 3-4 seconds

Pylon:
 Increase Shield rengerated per second.

This is to make Wattson feel more like a Mobile Bunker, rather than her having to take a long time to set up, these changes make her more available to her team and provide them with better affects from the Pylon too.

Crypto:
Survey Drone:
 Have the drone display information such as Helmet,Body Shield, Knockdown Shield, Backpack Rareity and Kills while in a distance of 10 Meters while looking directly at the target. This would give your team a plethora of information that can determine who you should focus in a gunfight, this would also give the drone more of a purpose regarding gear for future fights.

EMP:
 Perfectly fine no changes here.


Revenant:
Silence:
Increase the radius of which it hits targets and/or have it chain to nearby enimes that are within a range of half the radius.

Death Totem: Remove or reduce the affect that shows the direction of the Totem. 

Lifeline:
DOC: 
Reduce DOC cooldown and increase the size of the Resurrection shield more in every direction.

Care Package:
 Increase the chance of Better gear later in the game.

This would make Lifeline more of a support than just a glorified loot crate.

Pathfinder:
Grapple:
Increase range(2Meters) and cool down(By 1-2 seconds)

Zipline: Remove its ability to be placed on destructable objects such as Caustic's traps

fs16jp,temporadraconisPS4,Double the Events,"!This is not referring to the amount of time each event is up for!

I have two event ideas that I think would be AWESOME! Their names are: Hot Swap and Extra Token.

**Hot Swap -**

This event would change what kit you're using in battles. Specifically, your passive, tactical, and ultimate. Class passives could stay the same when they're released, but you would always have to figure out what your abilities actually will be. Wraith could drop in with Wattson's kit or even Mirage's, but she would remain herself and have the extra two grenade slots. The fun part about this would be never knowing what you'll be using. Will you have your character's kit or will you be playing a kit you're unfamiliar with? Who knows! But, you better think fast! Because the dropship ejects ALL PASSENGERS halfway through its flight course. Good luck Legends, and I hope you create many fences!

**Extra Token -**

Get ready for some odd plays in this mode. You'll have more than just your two squadmates to contend with. The system seems to be fine. Kits are all normal, loot is still random, even the drop ship seems to like its passengers. However, when you get into a fight with a squad, for some reason they are taking no damage and when they ping you as an enemy, you see it. What's this all about then? Well, they're your FRIENDLY squad. You're now stuck with 3 more teammates, but their abilities don't help you. Except, for some reason, when their Pathfinder scans a beacon, you get the ring location on your map as well! What? My squad's been eliminated and I'm NOT spectating the squad that killed me? I suppose that's because my friendly squad is still alive! Woohoo! I might even get a higher placement just because my friendly squad is still going! (squads remaining is marked as 10 until both squads are eliminated, and you do get to see what your fellow squad is playing on your squad screen, which means you might be able to coordinate a dual squad)",7,1585608705,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fs16jp/double_the_events/,apexlegends,1

frzfut,clemennntt,How to go to diamond in the split 2.,"Hi guys, 

I am writing this because I am stuck in platinum IV since the reboot.
I got diamond in ranked series 2 and in the split 1 of the series 3 so I have fairly good level but I find the game different on the old map because the map is smaller.

That is why if you have some advise to arrive diamond I am taker üòÅ

I play with a friend so we are two and we play Wattson and Path in order to scan the next ring and find a good place to camp with Wattson (it is the meta, in each game we are 5 squads in the last ring and everyone is camping with a gibraltar's dome, as in competition but I am surprised to see that in platinum, normally it was from the diamond). 

And also what weapons do you use ?
On world's edge I used flatline and L-star but I feel like the meta has changed. A lot of people play the havoc / G7 / prowler and even the longbow like in the good old days üòÖ

Thank you for your help

fryh9h,AndromedaGaming95,Call In A Care Package To Combat Covid-19 As Apex Legends.,"  

**Calling In For A Care Package**

Hello Apex Legends team I hope that you guys are doing well in these difficult times. As a player of your game I must say that everyone there at EA is doing a fantastic job in keeping the game servers going and up to date despite the whole quarantine and Covid-19 situation, and I along with the rest of my fellow teammates and Legends are very grateful to you guys who are giving us a different outlet of being social through your video-games. My name is Jahdiel Ortiz, I am 25 years old and I am a minor league Apex Legends E-Sports player and content creator currently residing in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Unlike many people in the world I am fortunate that I still have a job due to my day-job and my income as a content creator and digital artist. I am also the son of a medical healthcare professional who is risking her life to go out there and help the cause of battling covid-19 as a renowned traveling Nurse Practitioner in the state of Florida. One of our teammates for E-Sports Apex Legends competitions is also a Nurse hailing from the UK, clocking in 8-16 hours for the NHS in order to combat Covid-19, and after work, clocks in 4-8 hours daily on Apex Legends.

With being surrounded by such inspiring individuals as a gamer, content creator, and artist I put thought into how I can also assist in helping out in combating Covid-19 through my own individual skills as I am sure many others are on the same boat as I am but are unaware of how to approach it. My thoughts and prayers are always with my mother and our fellow teammate and I always hear the daily stories about the shortages within their units of proper medical equipment, sanitation chemicals, and continuous risk of contamination to the virus due to these shortages. 

This is why I am reaching out to your team. I had a thought of what if I could combine all of my skillsets and implementing the things I really love and care about such as your game, which has provided me with countless opportunities and opened many doors for me and my personal life into a cause towards helping fund local hospitals or locations where these shortages are taking a toll on our supporting work force. I as a gamer, and as an Apex Legend want to be proactive during these times rather than just sit at home gaming without a care in the world because there are too many things to care about. So I wanted to share an idea, thoughts and potential proposals so that all Apex Legends within your community could be called to arms in helping combat Covid-19.

üì∑ Thinking back on my years as an AGL Overwatch competitor I remembered that Blizzard Entertainment raised over $12.7 million dollars that were donated towards the Breast Cancer Research Foundation through the release and selling of a support/ medic character pink skin known as Mercy. This package was a $15 one time purchase that came with a specific emote, and character spray for in game use. So I automatically thought, it wouldn‚Äôt be such a bad idea if Apex Legends did something similar. Apex Legends has 4 fantastic characters that could be used for such a relief effort campaign to do our part as gamers for our health care professionals pulling out ‚Äúclutch resses‚Äù out on the field. There is Octane who has a syringe in order to enhance his, physical stamina like a flu shot or vaccine. There is Gibraltar, who is a combat medic of sorts very reminiscent of EMT‚Äôs. There is Wattson who revives her teammates as if she had defibrillators built into her hands. And last but not least you have Life Line; Apex Legends most effective and iconic combat medic and support character who is exactly what her name suggests ‚Äì a medic. 

üì∑ I as a gamer would love to be proactive in the fight against Covid-19 through my use of gaming; as I am sure, many of us gaming and especially Apex Legends content creators would love to do. Through selling these skins it would give us players a chance to raise funds and do our part for this relief effort on shortages of protective and sanitizing medical equipment, all the whilst practicing social distancing because all that the players would need to do is purchase their favorite skin or all of the skins for those who can, and wear them on streams, during gameplay, and just show appreciation to those healthcare professionals doing their best and putting their lives at risk to combat this issue, and most importantly keep them safe. These skins are not something tangible that could spread the virus so there would be optimum safety in not contracting the virus and we could select said healthcare facilities that the relief money could be used to place order and sent to those facilities (‚ÄúA Care Package‚Äù as Apex Legends Character Combat Medic Life-Line would say) in these times of need.

Once again I am suggesting this as a request out of concern to our healthcare professionals knowing the exact daily conditions of what they go through and are exposed to. If there is any way else that I or my team could help with, please contact us. If this Life-Line ‚ÄúCare Package‚Äù is not possible I also thank you for taking the time to read this letter and I will continue to support Apex Legends and compete in this game! Take care, stay safe and we hope to hear from you guys soon! 

PS: I am not sure what account I am contacting you guys from, because I have a PC account and a PSN account. More than anything I am usually playing on my PSN account called Andro\_NinSpeed.

frxmfu,Nerdlife87,Apex legends ranked fix proposal,"So I have been reading a lot of people not happy with how ranked works being in diamond facing vs preds etc.  I have seen a lot of posts about this and honestly there is an easy fix for this, but it probably won't be implemented. I'll also get flamed with the normal responses but I'll give a quick response to why this idea would work.  The game needs to be cross platform with consoles. Let me debunk the main arguments real fast.  


1.) Mouse keyboard &gt; controller

There are actually good amount of PC preds that use controller already.  The aim assist is ***quite generous*** in apex legends for controllers. This is the same with the new COD battleground and you can be very competitive on console vs a PC player.  


2.) Right now this is the major problem between console and PC currently. Frames. This is an issue now, but with the future generation consoles around the corner this would resolve that difference with 120fps on console.  


Anyways back to my original point. Apex has a healthy population but it's by no means a large population of players. If you were able to combine PC, PlayStation, as well as Xbox player games together then you could fix the queues and not have to play predator games as a diamond IV. Let's also be real: you aren't going to compete well if you're in diamond and you are a semi casual player who maybe plays 1-2 hours a day if you happen to have time vs someone who is playing the game as part of their job 6-8 hours a day. It just won't work. 

I'm not saying everyone should be masters and pred, but with a higher population of players you could definitely break out match queues by rank a lot better.

Last point: oh I'm on console and I've been pred 3 seasons and don't want to lose it because I have to play vs PC players.  I bet more than anything console players have more to prove and would enjoy the challenge since they have heard PC &gt; console their whole life so that argument wouldn't really stand up too well.

I honestly hope this could one day be the case and I would like to see games in the future go towards a model like this in the future.  I personally have console friends who don't have a PC but I would love to play games with them still if we had the opportunity to.",2,1585597157,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frxmfu/apex_legends_ranked_fix_proposal/,apexlegends,1

I could go on and on with the issues with this game and its company and publisher but I'll just stop there. I have been speaking out on the issues with this game for many, many posts, tried to get in contact of Respawn(but failed), but it never results to anything. Apex is still the same; A game with SO much potential but ultimately fails because of the lack of tapping into that potential. I am at the point now where I dont care what happens to this game because it deserves it.

frw2x6,problematlc,My most memorable SE3 round,"First of, I need to thank the enemy Pathfinder for being fluent enough in gold shield nudging.

Clearly a highly intelligent intellectual who prefers a fun ending over a guaranteed win. 

Extra thanks for &gt;!not allowing lifeline to revive Wraith and not using the r99. !&lt;

You are awesome! **Thank you** so much! You made my day. 

As for the video, oh boy, where do I begin, this is a prime example of ""Anything that can go wrong will go wrong"". And it did.

&gt;!I accidentally dropped all my med kits and almost got myself killed going back to loot pile twice.(Seriously, do not ever do that)!&lt;

&gt;!I used the big med kit for the last 10% because I was not sure if Lifeline will drop it. (We had a g7 exchange rivalry before, he tried to thirst me and revive wraith). !&lt;

&gt;!I didn't want to hit the Lifeline first, I was waiting for a signal. When in Rome... . Well I did get a signal in my face and got cornered fast. I should've paid attention.!&lt;

&gt;!I got super lucky the drone stayed and fully healed me. !&lt;

&gt;!Once Ajay got defeated, I could smell the victory - I saw pathfinder rather nervous, which made me think Lifeline was their best player. Considering he was armed, I went all in and closed the distance asap. It paid out despite the unexpected twist in the end. !&lt;

&gt;!Only thing I did right though, was taking it easy with Wraith. I was trying to get a last round fight since season 1 and I learned that if the solo player is too sweaty 99% of the time someone will interfere. There is always one player who doesn't want to risk it.  I also learned that stale fights tend to make others end it. When the fight got stale, I deliberately opened myself, so she would attack and I could get the last hit. !&lt;

Description: Tall, Belizean woman with long black hair. Her arms are both prosthetics made of an unknown black metal. She wears full combat gear and carries a portable generator on her back. 

Story: Former IMC soldier removed from service as a specimen for scientific experiments. She was held in the same lab as Wraith but, unlike Wraith, never escaped captivity and instead serves an unknown master. Her mission is to uncover valuable intel on the Apex Games in order to seize control of the games and its secrets. Ohm has been outfitted with a hyper conductive body that utilizes electricity to utterly destroy her foes.

Passive: 

lightning rod- Ohm receives 20% less damage from electricity damage (arc stars and Wattson traps)

Stunner- Ohm‚Äôs melee causes a slight distortion effect on her enemies and increased knockback 

Active- 
Lightning Rounds- Ohm can load any weapon with a single mag of lighting rounds which ricochet off surfaces and cause a slight distortion effect (45 second cool down) 

Ultimate- 

Lazarus Strike- Ohm summons a lightning bolt which recovers 50 health and 100 shields and grants a 20% movement speed boost. Can only be used outside and has a 3 second activation time.

Diamond is a bitch to get to and last season was composed of about 7.1% of the population while apex press was about 1%. So now only 1% of guys (since master rank is still basically the best players in the game) get dive trails? This just doesn‚Äôt seem fair.

I‚Äôm all for players earning rewards but diamond is the first rank that requires dedicated effort to get to, especially considering getting to plat is mostly a matter of time spent.

He turned in his mix about 4 mins in and simply said ‚Äúidiots‚Äù... not sure why considering me and the other team mate where in the same page heading to the circle and communicating through pings while he ran towards the storm... 

Anyway finally we meet up after 8 mins just as we approach a gun fight. We had the upper hand as there are 3 squads fighting it out and we have the high ground. 

Instead of scoping the situation and waiting for the opportune moment he ziplines straight into the middle of the fight solo without even pinging or saying anything into his mic. 

Instantly he is downed. Next second a stream of colorful abuse is screamed down the mic about how shit we are and what we should go do to ourselves. 

The fight dies down and he starts begging me to grab his banner. Usually this would be my main focus however not after what he had just done So I simply stand over his crate and tea bag him until he times out...

fruegj,hurky-pandora,Apex legends summer skins I thought of. Give me some feedback.,"2 epic Legend skins.
Pathfinder-Baywatch
Metallic light red with white lifeguard crosses transitioning across the body.
Lifeline-Lifeguard
Shiny White(basically silver) uniform with red lifeguard crosses moving around the torso and pants. 
7 legendary Legend skins.
Wattson-Tesla Diver
A scuba diver costume for Wattson that is mostly blue with orange highlights and an electric eel patch on the shoulders.
Revenant-Cursed Pirate
Revenant is a skeleton pirate that wears tattered red and black striped pants. Has a human skull design for the head with two gold teeth and his torso resembles a ribcage, he also wears a golden necklace with a lock. He also has a black head scarf on his head with an image of crossbones on it.
Gibraltar-Vacation Man.
Gibraltar wearing a Hawaiian shirt. Shorts, sandles, and wearing sunglasses. His gun shield is a a boogie board. And his backpack thing is a lawn chair collapsed down. With the arms sticking up. 
Caustic-Grilling Expert.
Caustic wears white elastic gloves, a red polo shirt and khaki jeans with a white apron that‚Äôs says. ‚ÄúKiss the cook, it will be your last mistake.‚Äù
(And if cosmetics on the ability for legends become a thing, I‚Äôd like the Gas barrels inflate to look like burgers)
Mirage-Sunburnt
Mirage wearing yellow swim trunks, a white tank top, and a pair of swimming goggles on his hair, and some sunscreen on his nose. And finally he has a visible sunburn on everything but his eyes(non burnt area shaped like his goggles)
Lifeline-Mermaid
Lifelines skins is replaced with turquoise scales, has blue hair, and has fin shaped ears, and wears a top made of seaweed with seashells embedded into it. She wears pants also made of seaweed with a star fish on each knee.
Bangalore-Cruise Captain
Bangalore wearing a white uniform that you‚Äôd normally see the captain of a cruise ship wearing while he/she is on duty.

A few weapon skin ideas.
Sentinel- Harpoon. The sentinel gets a slick black rounded design with a harpoon underneath the end of the barrel on the sentinel. This weapon matches Watson‚Äôs Tesla Diver skin.
L-Star-Super Soaker. The L-Star looks like a giant water gun with a green bottle in the back, a yellow body, water splash decal on the body, and orange handles.
P2020-‚Äúlil‚Äô squirter‚Äù a squirt gun design for the P2020, a green body, a squirt gun trigger, and orange nozzle on the front, and maybe a sticker of pathfinder with a snorkel on the side.


If this was an event that would deliver an heirloom then I‚Äôd say that the Heirloom would be Gibraltar‚Äôs War club.
You know, the war club we always see in his default finisher. What else could he have as an heirloom, right?",11,1585587109,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fruegj/apex_legends_summer_skins_i_thought_of_give_me/,apexlegends,1

frub31,_Prink_,A small change that would make looting way more streamlined (on PC at least).,"Instead of having to swap weapons around if we want to apply scopes and/or attachments, let us do this:

See something on a box (either a deathbox or a loot capsule) that you want? Left-click it to apply it to your primary, right-click it to put it on your secondary gun. Bada-bing bada-boom, done. No more delays, no more accidental equipping, no more ""oh shit, but I have my weapon holstered, let me switch to it first and then swap to my secondary, crap I just got knocked"".

Not sure about console controls, but I'm sure there's gotta be a spare key that could be used during looting for the same purpose.

It is because whenever I play normal match my teammates are around the level 100-150(decent players,I'm around 250) the champion is a guy with 3k-4k damage badge or a 20 kill damage badge with hierloom. If not the champion then at least there are at least 3 to 4 teams with those characteristics. So I go on playing ranked but even there the matchmaking is messed up. Either my teammates will be 1,2 tier low or the opponents are 1 tier high(if I'm platinum teammates are either gold or bronze and enemy is diamond).I know I'm not a great player but still how am I supposed to play with whatever matchmaking system that is currently existing.

frtf6h,The_Deep_Chaos,A good side effect of SBMM,"I know people have talking how they want SBMM removed. For some reason they want to have fun while playing, not sure why. But there is one really good thing that results from SBMM. All of the cheaters/hackers will have a high MMR because their stats tend to be better. Because of this, all of the cheaters will mostly likely end up in higher MMR lobbies. This improves the game so that 90% of the playerbase can have a fair game. This is ideal since its been made clear that the higher skilled 10% are expendable.

frsj2t,igikoe,A Gamebreaking connection error that makes the game unplayable for a lot of german users.,"Hi there, since my efforts to reach ea through their ea help page seems to go unnoticed Ill try to get some support right here, maybe someone already delt with this issue.

So this issue started with the new ranked split on the 25th, however this issue was already known in season 1 but dissapeared after a couple of days. Back then I thought this was an issue on my side.

So this thread is one of many adressing the problem but being ignored by EA so far (in german, sry):  [https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technische-Fragen/Unable-to-connect-to-EA-servers/m-p/8877573#M3271](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technische-Fragen/Unable-to-connect-to-EA-servers/m-p/8877573#M3271)

So they players get the ""unable to connect to ea servers"" but can connect after a few times hitting retry. After that there is the problem of us not being able to join lobbys on our screen(we are in the lobbys on our mates screen), and a party of 3 starting into the game without the player with connection problems and being only 2 players. This makes the game unplayable obviously. However this issue only appears during the times with high traffic (approx. 16:00-24:00).

This problem is lead back to the ""Telekom"" network provider in germany. However their tech support says its not their issue and since this appeard with the update to the ranked split it only makes sense its a problem on EAs side. I hope to generate some attention with this post, since they dont care about their own help page? Sorry for all mistakes and thanks for any help.

Berenstein , reality bending legend. Possibly half human, techwear druid aesthetic type thing idk

Passive   : Having Berenstein on your team allows for any Wattson fences, Caustic barrels, Octane pads to be placed on an vertical surface and walls and ceilings, altering the layout of trap placement. Allows pathfinder zips to be fired up, creating a mini redeploy.

Tactical (Schrodinger): creates a random deathbox containing 3 random items that teammates can loot. If an enemy loots a Berenstein created box it reveals their position on the map for 10 seconds and shocks then like a wattson fence. 1 min cool down 

Ultimate (Prestige) : creates a physical mirrored wall that reflects reality back at your foe for 10 seconds allowing you or your team to escape and confuses your enemy team.",2,1585574602,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frqpn0/legend_concept_berenstein_reality_bender/,apexlegends,1

frqc1t,appl3titan,Apex legends thoughts,"Dear All,

I am writing this to you after 750hours of game play and managing to maintain diamond rank for all the seasons since  launch.

Just a few thoughts on what I think needs to be done. This is not a rant, I love the game.

Let's start off with a positive, In context this BR GAME is just superior to what's on offer in the market. Characters, movement, guns, just wow on that end it is a work of art.

The maps are good and the speed of gameplay is top.

Yet I hate to see a few things.

Right now I'm in gold 2 rank after the split, that's fine the game is actually fun in gold and plat, when diamond comes along again getting 3 stack predators and the not so uncommon cheater is another story. Unfortunately diamond players and above are a small percentage of the community, and maybe we need to be recognized a bit more then your average Joe.

I get that it is at the end of the day all business, yes you need to make money. However your only skins that I would call legendary are when you ask us to pay the 7k apex coins for a box in your events.
Maybe make it that we can grind for it ?

Character hitboxes, cough cough, wraith please give them a look into. It's wraith and Pathfinder all game every game, I wonder why.

And if you have a split and we haven't seen Kings canyon since October I think the least you could have done is changed it a little, instead if giving us the exact same copy of  the battle charge version on the map, missed opportunity there my dudes.

Last one can we have another type of smg, that category of gun is stale, in Titanfall there is the car smg if I'm not mistaken wink wink.

Hope respawn reads this.

frpj8u,inertia_HWK,I kind of hate the ban time and solo dropping.,"Here's how it went.
Wraith dropped solo at Skull Town, leaving me and Mirage to figure out where to go.
Mirage chose containment, we drop there, and both of us get knocked.
At the time, I didn't realise how far away the Wraith was.
Timer for both of us runs out, we spectate Wraith. 
She's around 400-500m away and my timer is on 30 seconds. 
I leave because she's not coming and probably even if she did try, wouldnt make it in time.
I get banned for 10 minutes.
Wonderful.

While the whole ban is annoying, the main reason for our downfall is because the Wraith dropped solo. Didn't ping where she wanted to land beforehand, just dropped. So, should dropping solo be allowed in ranked? Im saying like fully drop solo, not detaching from the squad mid drop.",5,1585569786,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frpj8u/i_kind_of_hate_the_ban_time_and_solo_dropping/,apexlegends,1

frozss,djmitchell705,Legend Balance Part 2 (Octane),"This is the balance changes for octane that, in my opinion, will make him an S tier legend and very viable for the team. Remember, we cannot test the game so it can't be too op if if it isn't tested. 

                                    Octane's playstyle:


Octane should definitely be the fastest legend in the game on foot. While pathfinder can move to high places faster and have more vertical movement, octane is able to move way faster on the ground than any legend and is one of the hardest to hit while being able to be the fastest to rush in our rush out of combat. Having the lowest cooldown of all his abilities and his speed makes him a very dangerous opponent to go up against since he'll be strafing extremely fast and run away fast, though an octane can be downed easily if not careful. 




                                        Buff/Changes:

Passive: Buff the passive to 1:1 and make it to where it constantly regen even when using stim/taking damage. This change is mostly for the stim usage since right now, you take way too much health just go barely the speed that pathfinder can achieve. This passive will be more helpful in combat if you don't have medkits and acts as a secondary healing but not effective and it'll encourage players to use their stim more. 


Tactical: His stim ability is very underwhelming. Firstly, buffing the speed from 30% to 40%/45% will be much more functional (again it depends which one is more balanced, I cannot test it myself.) Of course he'll still take damage from it. But not only does stim make him run very fast it'll also let him become completely immune to slows. That means Wattson's traps, caustic's gas, Bangalore's ult/tactical (my previous buff for her will make sense) cannot slow him but of course he still takes the damage and the effect. Also during stim, he can shoot while running. This will make sure you'll be basically a strafing god while on stim and become a very aggressive player, better yet it has a very low cooldown and last a good amount of time (cooldown and duration stays the same). 

Ultimate: This is more like a rework than a buff since the Jump Pad is literally a worse zipline at the moment. To make it as useful as Wraith's portal and Pathfinder's Zipline, there will be a slight buff to how far it takes you and there will now be a feature called ""Double Jump."" This will allow you to push the Jump button in midair after using jumppad to go higher and farther to the direction your left stick is pointing. The jump pad will now be able to be used for transportation though it'll not take you as far as pathfinder's Zipline (cause that'll be unfair). But it's unique in it's own way because it can be used for transportation, going aggressive on a team, or fleeing. This will also make you hard to hit in the air as your movement will be unpredictable. 


Low Profile: This may be weird to you since octane has a tactical that takes away his own health, but hear me out. Without low profile there wouldnt be anything else to counter his passive and his godly speed and strafing. His buffed passive would simply make him a little too strong since he'll always be healing in a fight, so that's why I gave him low profile. 



Again thank you for reading and this is my opinion on how to buff octane. It depends if his buffed passive would make him too strong but again I can't test the game. What do you think?",8,1585567366,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frozss/legend_balance_part_2_octane/,apexlegends,1

Anyone know how you can do this without a VPN? Any local way to do it?

7ms is unbearable, 21ms (my max to anywhere in europe) is marginally better but really about the same, currently I go on USA servers for 100ms, but the movement gets a bit choppy. I want to find the perfect balance of nice movement and least disadvantage vs toaster internet.

frn9pl,AntaresNico,Shop rework concept,"Lately we have seen many discussions about the store in apex and the recolors. We can all agree, the shop is ridicule and need some tweaks. So I had a little idea of concept and I want to share it with you to discuss and see what you you want.

Just some points before I start : English is not my first language so I will certainly make some mistakes (in clear if you don't understand ask me to reformulate). Secondly I'm in **favor** of the return of old recolor.

The idea is to kept the rotation of 1 week to allow to everyone to had the possibility to grab what they want in time but at the same time to have each day something new.

***Monday :*** A new recolor

***Tuesday*** ***:*** An old recolor

***Wednesday :*** An old recolor (during like one semester to catch the delay between new an old recolors, and after they could make some exclusives recolors of event skin)

***Thursday :*** A new recolor

***Friday :*** An old recolor

***Saturday :*** A discount for a legendary item

***Sunday :*** A discount for a legendary item

All legendary item can now be purchased with apex coins all the time but the shop will now only be here to give discount and bundle of skin (Example : Skin Caustic ""Third Emperor"" with the prowler skin ""Dark Fright"").

For the people who want to kept the exclusivity of their recolor, I have two solutions :

\- When an old recolor came back, they are lightly more expensive so you had the benefit to had like a ""discount"" when you buy it during their first appearance in the shop.

\- In the selection screen your skin had a little symbol (like a star for example) to indicate that you had purchased the skin during is first release.

The Legend is a ex-milita combat medic who specializes in healing teammates from a distance

His passive ability is last stand:
when downed the player is able to lay on their back and pull out the last gun they had equipped.( if they choose to) they are unable to reload or move after they arm themselves and are left stationary 

His tactical is stim shot: he has a wrist mounted stim launchers on cool down that heal 30 hp per stim these stims can't be injected into yourself and you are forced to rely on other means of healing

For his ultimate he throws a amp wall that lasts for 20 seconds (for those not familiar with amp walls think of it as Gibbys dome but you can shoot through it and your bullets become disruptor rounds) the base of the wall can be destroyed and deactivated by cryptos ultimate 

Overall this character is a supportive defender with a hitbox close to bloodhound he has a bit of rivalry with Bangalore cause of the whole frontier war but he gets along well with everyone

frmh8e,IbexSupreme,A concept for Titans,"In the game right now there aren‚Äôt any legends that were pilots in the Frontier War. Right away this removes the possibility of Titans being added to the game as they were in Titanfall, but I think they could be implemented with a bit of work as a sort of vehicle without being game breaking or annoying.
First off, as stated Titans can‚Äôt be fully used, the Legends don‚Äôt know how to pilot them. Instead, they could only be piloted as far as walking and running, all the weapons would be unusable. Only one Legend could pilot the titan itself, and would have to manually enter, and exit it, no arm assistance from the Titan, no ejecting. The other two members of the squad could climb on top of the Titan similar to the Rodeo feature in Titanfall, and shoot from on top of it‚Äôs shoulders. I think this would give the Titan a good balance of being a usable vehicle that provides extra speed, without granting any significant advantage in a fight, as a squad using a Titan would be down one gunner, and be out in the open, as well as having to deal with a shaking screen to fire. As far as damage from being stepped on by the Titan goes, I think a direct hit at full running speed from a Titan should deal 100 damage, and walking into an enemy Legend would deal minor (maybe 25) damage and a short stun effect. This would make running directly at squads with the Titan generally unfavourable, since the damage output compared to risk isn‚Äôt stellar.
Lastly, the Titan‚Äôs health. Since there aren‚Äôt any Titan batteries lying around, instead Phoenix kits would be used. First, one needs to be consumed to use the Titan in the first place, in the same fashion the Sentinel uses a Shield Battery, making sure not everyone can just grab one when they feel like it. Once powered up, it wouldn‚Äôt have any proper shields (since its not using a proper battery) and would essentially be in the ‚ÄúDoomed‚Äù state from Titanfall, where regular gunfire does have an effect on it. So in this state, roughly 750 damage would cause it to explode, downing whoever is in or on it when it does. When the Titan gets damaged, one Phoenix kit can charge it back to full health, but can only be applied from oustide the Titan while it isn‚Äôt moving.
I think another cool way to implement it into the game would be to incorporate Legend abilities to the Titan as well, such as allowing it to phase if a Wraith is piloting it, or send out a Titan hologram if Mirage is piloting it, but this is a long shot as it would be way too hard to properly implement, and altogether might be a bit too wacky for the game.
Either way, I know a lot of people on here don‚Äôt want vehicles added to the game at all, and I know Respawn has already stated they don‚Äôt intend to add Titans to the game, I just think it would be a fun addition that could make games feel more unique.",3,1585553963,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frmh8e/a_concept_for_titans/,apexlegends,1

frlpc8,ChicagotheDon,Is there anything big that respawn can bring in the next season that would be game changing?,"Warzone brought the store so you can buy kill streaks and even customized loadouts which im not gunna lie is really freaking cool. Last year there were leaks that respawn was going to introduce a Blisk which wouldve allegedly brought a similar system in order to upgrade attachments. I understand it was a leak and may be something they were trying and didnt like or didnt think would fit in the game and im perfectly accepting of that. 

Having said that, I do think the loadout purchase option to buy a customized loadout is really awesome. I like it because you can get a loadout your comfortable with and can rely on. I would be ecstatic if they could incorporate that into apex. It could be something like you have to find the gun in the game and get kills with it to earn better attachments or get xp based on placement and then in the loadout screen you can set actual preferred loadouts. And it could be as simple as theres the world packages anf then theres also the loadout packages randomly. 

I think this would be useful especially in apex because you can literally go an entire fame without every finding a gun you want or the proper attachments. This also allows you to even change your game play style mid or late game if needed. I realize this is copying warzone but i believe itd be a pretty big improvement.

Having said that i realize its a lengthy post and any respectful comments would be appreciated as i would like to know other peoples opinions.",23,1585549804,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frlpc8/is_there_anything_big_that_respawn_can_bring_in/,apexlegends,1

1. I main Crypto, and he is a recon character, not a fighter. In fights, I use the drone to spot while my teammates go to the enemies and finish them. Sometimes by the time I get to the combat site, my team has already wiped them.
2. I snipe over anything else. I love sniping, but for me, it mainly gives me damage, not kills. Unless I one-shot with the Kraber, people go to cover after I snipe them a few times.
3. I'm ""always waiting for the perfect opportunity."" When I snipe, I always wait for the perfect situation and shot because of the reason above. Sometimes, that opportunity never comes. 
4. I try to ""save up for the endgame."" I never throw grenades because ""I might need them later,"" I preserve ammo for later, but that ends in my death.

frkuu8,Daemon7861,My ideas on how to buff Octane,"So I think we‚Äôre all aware at this point that Octane is . . . less than meta to put it nicely. He is outclassed by characters with greater speed and escapability such as Wraith and Pathfinder. Here are my ideas on how to buff him:

FRAG JUMPING: 
Titanfall vets will remember this one, using a grenade‚Äôs knock back to accelerate to insane speeds helped greatly in getting great runs on the gauntlet. Octane‚Äôs legs were lost in an attempt to pull off this stunt, and were replaced with the robotic ones we see now. I think that on top of Octane‚Äôs current passive, he should be able to use frag grenades to launch himself and generate momentum. To be specific, this would entail him taking greatly reduced damage from self inflicted frag grenade damage, and frags knocking Octane at high speeds away from the explosion, and sliding would maintain this momentum until it wore off

STIM: 
This is a key aspect of Octane‚Äôs toolkit, but overall it‚Äôs just rather underwhelming. My ideas for this would be to increase the speed bonus slightly, and to increase weapon handling (ADS and ready/stow speed) and reload speed while stimmed. This would give the ability some combat effectiveness, helping him more directly in fights and giving the ability some more utility than just escapes. This would also help his ability to fight against multiple targets, which he currently lacks in extremely.

JUMP PAD:
This ability just isn‚Äôt great. While it does provide a decent escape option, it leaves Octane and his teammates extremely vulnerable whilst airborne, and unable to fight back. To improve this, I would vary the options for how to use the Jump Pad, essentially creating the following techs:
Sliding into a Jump Pad will launch you a short distance up in the air (think 75% current height), but generate large amounts of forward momentum
Jumping/landing on a Jump Pad would launch you same height as current, but allow you to use skydive capabilities whilst doing so, making it a better escape tool.
On top of these techs, I would remove airborne accuracy penalties, especially to hipfire, while launching.


Let me know what you guys think, I feel like these changes could really help Octane out and make him a much more interesting character!",2,1585545503,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frkuu8/my_ideas_on_how_to_buff_octane/,apexlegends,1

For some context I'm currently diamond 3. Have been a predator multiple times, have over 10k on wraith and 4ks and 20's on multiple characters. Currently play on ps4.

Would anyone be interested in watching that gameplay, usually only have 1 teammate this season compared to before therefore, having to play a lot more conservative which makes for some unique situations. Would also be open to any tips and suggestions people may have as I look to increase my twitch popularity. 

Considering also potentially broadcasting fifa 20, warzone, and the witcher as they're all games I will pop in.

frkqub,m3ntalparkour,This game needs to reward good behavior,"## The problem

The enjoyment of this game is directly correlated with the quality of one's teammates. Unfortunately there are lots of players who engage in one or more of the following behaviors:
 
* leaving games when they get killed or knocked
* leaving games when they don't get their main Legend
* not communicating their actions or plans via the ping system
* not following those who do communicate their actions or plans via the ping system (this includes solo dropping)
* griefing games for their own amusement
* abusive language either via chat or microphone


## Why it is a problem

One person behaving in above ways will easily ruin the experience for the two other players. Personally, I try to be wholesome, but over time it gets frustrating and I have to take breaks from the game in order to avoid becoming toxic myself. My friends also take breaks from the game due to unwholesome behavior of random teammates.


## Small solution

People who frequently leave games tend to be also those who engage in other unwholesome behavior. Grouping these people into their own squads would reduce the frustration for those people who at least stick around to see how their teammates do even if they die or don't get their main Legend.


## Big solution

1. Implement a sort of an endorsement system, such as in [Overwatch](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Endorsements), which includes positive endorsements for leadership, teamwork and sportsmanship.

2. Create a metric that takes in account both endorsements and premature leaving, and use that to group random squads together. That way people who enjoy being team players and wholesome will have an improved gameplay experience and will thus spend more time in the game.",58,1585544981,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frkqub/this_game_needs_to_reward_good_behavior/,apexlegends,1

frkm5j,HalconDeMito,Why Octane? (Controller),"I don't mean to start an argument and I have been wrong many times in the past I just want to get a perspective of you Octane mains out there. I love Apex and I love the fact that it is a team based game (please add solos) including it's legends Lifetime, Gibby, Wattson, Crypto, Caustic traps help set up base, Bangalore's smoke is great to move around the map and res, bloodhound has a great scan and can find enemies, everybody likes a Pathfinder in the team for that zip, a good Wraith can turn the battle with it's portal, heck even Mirage has that funny factor, jkn I don't see him in a lot of games.

Now for Octane, in the past few days or maybe weeks I have been seeing an increase in his selection rates, at least 6 out 10 games someone picks him. In my mind he would make a great solo legend, but in squads? What can he provide for a team? Jumpads are fun and could be deadly but most people don't even use them throughout the game. But still I prefer a zip or a portal. As a main Wattson I don't think that is cool, I spend a lot of time placing fences and looking out for the team, carrying 2 UA for the end fight and I like it it's just that I think Octane is a little selfish option in a team based game. 

Again I have been wrong and I just want a different point of view to maybe understand things that I am not seeing. Have a great day.",21,1585544389,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frkm5j/why_octane_controller/,apexlegends,1

* Max Level Can Perform Executions 1.5 seconds faster, executions restore health and shields.
* Upon leveling up, Evo Shield Gains One FULL Pip of Defense. Upon reaching Max Level, Evo Shield heals fully.
* Max Level Upon damage taken, highlight the position of the shooter for 3 seconds.
* Upon leveling up, weapons are reloaded.

Sometimes they jump on their own elsewhere, they drop poorly and land in bad loot spots, late, or in the middle of the hottest zone where even if you beat the other 5 squads you aren't walking away with ammo or heals because they've all been used.  Sometimes they run in to bottle neck locations in mid-game that anyone with a brain in their head will know that there's at least one squad already waiting to completely wipe them in 3v1 leaving you no other choice but to try and rescue or play the rest of the game short handed.   Very few randoms will split the loot for the best needs of the squad vs themselves.  They might even not try to revive you, they would rather loot while you bleed out.

Berenstein , reality bending legend. Possibly half human, techwear druid aesthetic type thing idk

Passive  : Having Berenstein on your team allows for any Wattson fences, Caustic barrels, Octane pads to be placed on an vertical surface and walls and ceilings, altering the layout of trap placement. Allows pathfinder zips to be fired up, creating a mini redeploy.

Tactical : creates a random deathbox containing 3 random items that teammates can loot. If an enemy loots a Berenstein created box it reveals their position on the map for 10 seconds and shocks then like a wattson fence. 1 min cool down 

Ultimate : creates a physical mirrored wall that reflects reality back at your foe for 10 seconds allowing you or your team to escape and confuses your enemy team.",1,1585539997,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frjnz8/legend_concept_berenstein/,apexlegends,1

frj90n,PwnedDead,I think it‚Äôs be cool if the announcer had more voice lines like in the trailers. I have a few ideas.,"In the trailers the announcer says things like ‚Äúchampion double kill‚Äù or something along those lines. That would be super cool to see in the game. 

Some others I‚Äôve thought of would be:

‚ÄúChampion squad wipe‚Äù 

‚Äú kill leader squad wipe‚Äù

‚ÄúNew kill leader with ( #of kills)‚Äù

‚ÄúChampion is contested‚Äù (when someone is out performing the current champion or the best in the lobby, maybe when someone is fighting the champion) 

‚Äúkill leader eliminated the champion‚Äù

‚ÄúChampion eliminated the kill leader‚Äù

Also announce things like.. 

‚ÄúHalf the squads remain‚Äù (10 squads left) 

‚ÄúFinal squads‚Äù (3 squads left) 

Of course you can‚Äôt have to many annoying announcements, it will ruin the announcements and to many can overlap and you won‚Äôt get to hear them. These are just a few that I think would be cool, to make the apex games feel more like a real blood sport. 

Any other cool ones I‚Äôm open to hear about.",1,1585538205,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frj90n/i_think_its_be_cool_if_the_announcer_had_more/,apexlegends,1

friziw,Stevensgin,There was some arena announcer lines I heard on YouTube and they sounded awesome....,"Bro ‚Äúchallenger‚Äù I‚Äôm assuming this contest the kill leader. ‚ÄúChallenger has killed the kill leader‚Äù would be awesome to hear in the middle of a game like the two best players in the lobby just fought.
Then it had like kill leader triple kill lines too which I kinda liked. I just think there‚Äôs a lot they could do with the arena announcer that would make it cool 
what I had in mind was arena announcer voice packs like imagine hearing wraiths voice with like a speaker overlay on it or something or definitely mirages voice cause he could just be cracking jokes n what not n maybe crypto saying his cool lines like ‚Äúchallenger thought he could take on the kill leader, fool‚Äù. I wouldn‚Äôt be too far off with this cause they kinda did it with the mirage voyage event.
Anyway things like this would spice the game up for me. Really feel like they should start adding stuff to the game that isn‚Äôt meta changing or skins n whatever but more like titles like ‚Äúchallenger‚Äù n ‚Äúwildcard‚Äù whatever that is and maybe a title for the squad with the most kills ‚Äúkill leader squad‚Äù. Thinking they should change the kill leaders name to kill leader n make it red or some thing, yeah I know this isn‚Äôt a good idea but imagining more stuff like this in game. Maybe point multiplier for kills as kill leader then you get like triple if you were challenger then killed the kill leader. Maybe the kill leader and challenger can see each other‚Äôs location, kinda a bad idea but maybe a good idea for a game mode.",5,1585537105,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/friziw/there_was_some_arena_announcer_lines_i_heard_on/,apexlegends,1

frisum,estebaddie,Training mode search function,"So I just have a suggestion for the game, not sure if this is the best place for it though:

I play a lot of fighting games and something a lot of them do is allow you to search for matches while in training mode. This lets players practice their combos or set ups before a match. This is especially useful for when a player loses, it allows them to recreate the situation that caused them to fall off and get snowballed.

This could be really useful in apex for players who want to work on their aim more or their movement. For example, someone finds themselves in a really bad spot during a match, they don't have the technical capacity to out-manuever their opponent(s), so they can immediately jump back into training mode after they get eliminated and work on wall jumping. Maybe they realize they don't have good aim at certain angles or distances and their opponent manages to get a couple knockdowns from far range. They can go into training to practice both strafing and long distance shooting. This would be an optional thing so players who don't take the game as seriously can just pause between each game queue.

An additional suggestion would be to add more obstacles or buildings to training mode for those who want to work on movement. Lots of high ranking players can move extremely fluidly on the skyscraper building in capitol city (fragment east), but this is sort of hard to practice without taking the time to do it in a public match. Maybe more or similar obstacles can be added to the training mode, or pieces (areas) of already existing maps can be made playable in practice mode.",1,1585536309,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frisum/training_mode_search_function/,apexlegends,1

Both squadless and just us in the area, I oddly chose to let them live. I stood there, watching the area as they revive and get up. I did the White Flag T-Bag and went on my merry way. Thinking back on it, I probably could‚Äôve dropped a spare shield battery or something.

Fences can now destroy grenades if they fly through them. Breach damage increased.  


Caustic:  


Increasing amount of Gas traps you can set up by 3. OR Teammates don't get slowed by his traps.  


Mirage:  


Decoy reveal enemies it can see in range of xxx for 3 seconds. Also reveals enemies that got bamboozled (shot decoy) for the same amount of time.  


Gibraltar:  


Dome of protection also blocks enemies from moving in or out of it.  


Pathfinder:  


Extends grapple range by doubling it.  


Octane:  


Speed wont draw his health making it spammable at all times.  


Bangalore:  


If smoke hits enemy (deals damage) it reveals his location whenever he is in that smoke until it vanishes.  


Wraith:  


Void now also speeds up wraith and makes it a cancelable ability. OR Lets you pass through closed doors while in void.  


Crypto:  


Removes or greatly deacreses the noise that Drone makes, making it harder to find and better to scout with.  


Bloodhound:  


This would be the only passive upgrade. Picking a clue also gives information of Legends that made left those footprints as well as body shield they had (level) OR actual HP/Armor.  
Another idea would be: Killing enemies grant portion of health, if Bloodhound has full HP, instead it would get boost to  either damage or speed for lets say 10 seconds.  


Revenant:  


His silence bomb now also disables usage of items or weapon swapping. OR Silence also makes enemies it hits deaf, leaving them with only sight sense.",7,1585530682,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frhe0t/helmet_level_4_should_improve_abilities_instead/,apexlegends,1

frh1fm,Isak0336,Revenant buff ideas,"He‚Äôs underpowered. Here is my take at his buff.

Silence should make the opponent unable to switch weapons. Could also maybe make them unable to use healing items, although idk about that one.

Passive needs faster climbing (upgrade from 25% faster to 30%? dunno maybe 25 is already fast enough) and most importantly he does not slow down when climbing walls. Crouch walking speed is already good enough. Another thing, maybe revenant will say something like ‚ÄúI hear a skin suit‚Äù to himself if an opponents footsteps can be heard? His teammates would not hear it, (or maybe they could) kind of like Wraith‚Äôs passive.

As for his ultimate, either one of two things. 1: Your shields are not disabled, or 2: you spawn back with full health. The fact it can be destroyed is also kind of shit, but Idk if I would change that, seems fair enough

frgw33,Guerrin_TR,Performance on Xbox One X is absolutely embarassing.,"I'd like to put the foreword in here that I'm sorry this isn't a Wattson booty fan art post, or a ""me and my dog got our first win today"" post

Performance on Xbox One X is absolutely horrendous. The frame drops are incredible and noticeable.  I'm not expecting the console to pull off 60 FPS consistently but the drops I've been getting are....well .....pathetic.

During combat the game performs poorly and the experience suffers.  Turning becomes slower,  the stuttering makes minute aiming adjustments almost impossible.

It isn't a hardware issue as other games perform perfectly.  Overwatch maintains a steady constant FPS, as does MW.  

Whatever optimization patch was dropped at the start of S4 for Xbox failed or made things worse, not better.    

The game has been out a year.  Jedi Fallen Order has been released.  This has been an issue long before COVID-19 was a thing As well.   The ""it's a small studio"" excuse has been milked dry.  It's time to reinvest the money you've made off this game into the team to cope with the demands of running a popular BR game.

Let's get this game properly fixed once this virus business ends.  Optimization is the first step and one of the most important steps to getting this game back on track from a technical standpoint.",18,1585528770,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frgw33/performance_on_xbox_one_x_is_absolutely/,apexlegends,5

frexyi,RealZia,Kings Canyon Ranked," Is anybody else struggling immensely with the size of this map and the third party oblivion of every single fight? The distance between loot locations seems to give you about 15 seconds to start your fight, finish, loot, maybe res and heal.... This seems to continue until the end of the game where every fight never ends as every single team on the map continues to rotate in when they hear gun shots... Am i missing something or is the size of this map detrimental to ranked play? Really missing Worlds edge right now. That being said the non stop fighting of kings canyon is a more enjoyable experience. IMO: Kings Canyon should be always available for normal play and Worlds Edge should be for ranked.

frewh9,RandomStuf6,Ranked map system for next season (read description),"With the things being said about King's Canyon being unsuitable for ranked, I thought, what if they used a system like CSGO's Danger Zone, with short rotations of like, a half hour. This provides the best of both worlds, if you just want to play World's Edge, play ranked for 30 mins, then play 30 mins of casual until World's Edge comes back, and if you like both maps, just keep playing ranked. It also means the playlist wouldn't be split, meaning it shouldn't affect queue times hugely, unless most players won't play a certain map. So I made a poll to see what systems you would like for next season.

fre42b,GachiPls_DidntSave,Why are we still here? Just to suffer?,"Apex has been out for 419 days (ayyy almost)

In that time we've gotten:

*4 Legends = Octane, Wattson, Crypto, and Revenant.*

*4 weapons = Havoc, L-STAR, Charge Rifle, and Sentinel.*

*1 map = World's Edge.*

*2 sets of map changes = Season 2 for King's Canyon* ***(No longer accessible\*)*** *and Season 4 for World's Edge.*

*3 event locations = Octane's Gauntlet* ***(No longer accessible\*)****, Wraith's Lab* ***(No longer accessible\*)****, and Mirage Voyage.*

***\**** *= They are accessible but only though ranked right now. Not available as a casual playlist.*

*And 12 LTMs* ***(KC and KC After Dark not counted)****, 2 of which* ***(Solos and Duos)*** *should be standard modes not LTMs.*

**- - -**

If I'm not mistaken the only community idea that Respawn has actually implemented is the crown on the kill count for when you're kill leader.

Thats it. Just a silly little crown.

‚ùå *Have Solos been added?*

‚ùå *Have Duos been added?*

‚ùå *Have Quads been added or even tested?*

‚ùå *Is Crossplay a thing?*

‚ùå *Have we gotten better servers?*

‚ùå *Have we gotten an in game damage counter?*

‚ùå *Have we gotten the ability to rejoin games we DC'd from?*

‚ùå *Has the store been improved?*

**- - -**

Stop buying Apex Coins. Yes, even if the event skins look super cool. Speak with your wallet if you're not happy with the game.

Not entirely sure about Respawn but EA definitely only cares about your wallet. And EA owns Respawn so what EA says goes or Respawn gets the paddle.

If money keeps coming in then the game is perfect. If the money stops then and ONLY then will the game suddenly have problems that need fixing.

Why do you think collection events have been sticking around and actually happening more often despite us not liking the prices or the gambling? Because that's what brings in the money. Because we can't resist shiny new skins.

frdrob,Phaazedd,Worlds Edge vs Kings Canyon for 3rd partying.,"I'd like some peoples opinions on whether you think that you get 3rd partied more on Worlds Edge or Kings Canyon?

For me its 100% without question Kings Canyon, since the ranked split I can barely think of a game where we died when we didn't get 3rd partied.

It's just extremely frustrating and makes me not want to push people because if you don't end it within a minute you wont get any time to loot.

Not to mention theres hardly any loot on Kings Canyon, makes me wonder how we played it so much when it's actually a terrible map.",12,1585517555,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frdrob/worlds_edge_vs_kings_canyon_for_3rd_partying/,apexlegends,4

frdqce,HDCRSpectre,Ranked change I would like to see,"I‚Äôve been playing ranked a lot lately and I haven‚Äôt been really progressing. I would get about 2 knockdowns in a squad just to get finished by the 3rd guy when my teammates aren‚Äôt around. Just for me team to get outnumbered and so on. I believe that a person should get rewarded more in ranked. Like getting RP for damage and knockdowns. Ik it has happened to me where I would get about 1000 damage for 1 kill and 1 assist. And as mentioned I have been on multiple occasions in one of the knockdown situations where 2 are knock last member kills me and revives their teammates to become a 3 on 2 against my team mates. 

To summarise I would like to see players being rewarded for dealing damage and getting knockdowns. Even if it is 2RP per 100 damage which is a full unshielded knockdown. Or for a knockdown a person get 5RP but if it becomes a kill then a player gets the normal 10RP for a kill without the bonus 5. It doesn‚Äôt have to be exactly as the example I gave but it gives players the motivation to push engagements and be rewarded even if they lose the gun fight",8,1585517429,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frdqce/ranked_change_i_would_like_to_see/,apexlegends,4

frd73v,PatrickWK23,Good training routine?,"Hi, I‚Äôve been playing apex since the end of season 1. I used to be absolute garbage, but I thought I was good. (Thinking 2-3 kill games were good). 
But last month, I‚Äôve met someone, and I play with them every day. Needless to say, they are amazing (6-10 kill games, almost every game). Since I‚Äôve been playing with them, I‚Äôve seen myself improve a lot (4-5 kill game avg. in pubs). I know I‚Äôm not trash now, but I want to work on being as good as they are. I‚Äôve been working on snapping to targets in the firing range, and I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at that, but I don‚Äôt want to just polish one aspect of my game, I want to be a well-rounded player. What are some good training routines I can do to help with my overall gameplay.
Aim (90-95% accuracy close range) 
(70-80% long range, so I def. need work on that) 
Strafing could definitely use work. 
And recoil control isn‚Äôt terrible. With most guns it‚Äôs good, but I‚Äôd still like to touch up. Although, training on that is pretty self explanatory.

frchy7,Grammi_the_Clami,"Horrible lag, sound problems, and connection issues","It's hard for me to even get into a game sometimes and even harder for me to record a game to show the issues, so i'll explain best I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I will join a game (usually when the character select screen is up) and it will run ok for the most part.  We drop out of the ship and I start getting connection errors (mostly packet loss and player movement) and my audio starts to break with sounds cutting out, playing very late, or just flat out not making a noise.  I try to play with this but after about 2 mins my game freezes up for a while.  After it unfreezes, I can move around for a few seconds with everyone being frozen in time and then I proceed to be kicked back to the main menu with a time out error.

&amp;#x200B;

The audio bugs happened on and off when I played the game about a week ago, but it wasn't until now that I got horrible lag and connection errors whenever I play the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried resetting my router and repairing the game on Origin but honestly I don't even know if the problem is client or server side.

The only other game that I have similar problems with is Titanfall 2 which I sometimes get lag and audio problems but I never get kicked back to the main menu.

Both games being on Origin leads me to believe I have a bad connection to EA servers but I really don't know.

I proceeded to wipe a squad all by myself while they were talking shit. I went down to a third party as they're peacefully looting halfway across the map. I was polite through it all, but called them out for being toxic for no reason at all. They were asking me why I'm getting salty over a video game, as if it wasnt obvious they were bullying me. I dont understand why people are this mean. This is a real problem, and the fact that there are currently no ways to punish people who act in such a barbaric way is unacceptable. There needs to be a solution. This is serious. People who gang up on a teammate who doesnt even have his mic on at first are the scum of the earth. Absolutely unbelieveable.

frbikd,codeorange_,Weapon Sandbox Possibilities,"A lot of people have put forth ideas for new weapons in apex, and I've seen interesting choices stylistically, but after the addition of the sentinel I can't help but feel like they have all niches covered at this point from the brrrriest of machine pistols to the crackiest snipers. Today I'm going to break down each weapon and what kind of function they represent, and let's see if anything is missing in apex and if it should even be added in the first place.

Shotguns:

Peacekeeper. The peacekeeper is a pump shotgun that deals massive chunks of damage in one big burst. Perfect for downing injured enemies or easily pushing a 1v1 enemy in close quarters.

Eva8. The Eva 8 is an even closer range shotgun that deals less damage but fires significantly faster. This is great for doling out lots of damage in a very small amount of time even on multiple targets but it's short range can let you down outside of ambush scenarios. Great counterpart to the Peacekeeper in my opinion

Mozambique. I actually had to look in the game to remember if the mozam counted as a shotgun or a pistol but here it is. Very hit or miss weapon by design, representing the lower end of weapon balance. If you land your shots in close quarters it can be an okay last resort, and the hop up ads a new level of viability, so I say it's a fine addition to the shotgun category. Not something you're supposed to keep forever but not an unviable option.

Mastiff. The mastiff is the only fun in the game that reloads one shell at a time and also the only shotgun which is also a sniper (without hop ups) and all I can say is this is probably the weapon with the highest potential for a 3v1 turnaround victory in the game.

Overall, shotguns represent dueling weapons with high skill requirements that will net you quick kills in close quarters. This rewards aggressive positioning and consistent DM skills. Great selection.

Moving on now to pistols:

P2020. Very poppy handgun with just enough ammo in the base magazine to kill someone. In my opinion, an even weaker choice than the Mozambique, but I know many who disagree so I won't speak more about it except to say that it represents a long standing gaming sidearm and was basically a prerequisite for this game.

RE45. This is the Brrrrrriest machine pistol I mentioned earlier. I have personally used it to some effect in my own gameplay and while it will often let you down as a primary weapon, dumping a magazine into an unsuspecting assailant can be a quick way to finish them off once your shotgun or sniper runs dry. Good addition.

Wingman. The season 1 terror is now simply a vary viable sidearm with a high enough skill floor to not feel cheap. With high headshot damage and low ammo capacity this weapon is basically a pocket sniper, and represents a demand from players that use it that their aim should be rewarded. Good addition.

Overall, pistols represent very reliable sidearms in most situations and can be a good finisher in a lot of scenarios, great selection.

Moving on now to SMGs:

R-99. The r99 represents a less bursts alternative to the shotgun for players who still want to DM opponents in close quarters but who want to utilize consistent tracking as opposed to single shot accuracy. A bit harder to use out to middling ranges, but still incredibly strong up close so I'd say it's a good addition.

Prowler. The prowler is a burst/auto msg and represents a heavier damage, slower firing weapon. It's recoil is much more controllable than the r99 but it's close up damage is still very reliable. Wether used in burst or auto, this weapon makes a great primary for a mix of close to medium range engagements and fills a niche some players find appealing. Good addition.

Alternator. The alternator is an interesting weapon design wise as it's basically an sub machine gun with the firing rate of a dom machine gun. It's very subtle recoil and reliable per-hit damage as well as it's high ammo capacity (relative to fire rate) make this a great weapon for more conservative players who like to catch other players in the open. If the r99s range is unsatisfactory but the prowler's recoil is just too much for you then the alternator represents an easier weapon.

Overall, smgs are great primary weapons for people wanting to fight enemy teams at close-but-not-touching distance. Fights between buildings in fragment lend themselves to both the more gentle smgs in the streets and the r99 in extremely close quarters of the buildings themselves. Good selection, but this one is missing a single niche. A bizon like weapon with high fire rate and a high ammo capacity to match doesn't exist in this game but perhaps it should. As it is now, the high fire rate smg empties its mag in seconds.

Moving on to machine guns:

Spitfire. The spitfire is the great braka braka gun of this game, representing a high damage potential in a single magazine for players that just hate reloading. Great weapon for mowing down injured teams or for ambushing unaware players and surprising them with an unending hail of fire.

LStar. The previously gold LStar now has to play with the mortals but hasn't come up short. The LStar is a duelist's machine gun, rewarding bursts of fire with what is essentially passive reloading. This is a great weapon for actual suppression as you can fire this thing over and over and over and your enemy can never count on you having to reload.

Devotion. The most recent and most hilarious gold weapon, this gun is a team slayer. Walk into a room with a devotion and a red shield and watch the other squad weep in despair as their health is rapidly drained by damage unending. Whatever experimental bullets their using in this thing I want to shovel into an r99 because that would be the most godly weapon in apex history.

Overall, the machine guns represent sustained fire not seen in other weapon categories and deserve their spot in the sandbox. Good selection, but I wish there was a machine gun for longer ranges, with more manageable recoil. Closest we have is the flatline but that gun's hip fire is so awful that I can't classify it as a 'light machine gun lite'

Moving on to the assault rifles:

G7 scout. The scout, previously a sniper rifle, is now a face melter. High (enough) fire rate and very high per shot damage, along with very easily Magyars recoil, means you're doling out massive damage over extremely long ranges. Maybe this gun is on the chopping block but as it stands it fills a long range harassment niche (maybe too well) that is otherwise unrepresented. Good addition.

Flatline. The flatline is a difficult weapon to control, with its broad and flat hip fire basically demanding that you ads with it and it's high recoil forcing you to compensate heavily. If you do manage to control this unruly weapon, however, it pumps out massive damage. This is a weapon for people who want to stand still and win fights with CS:GO levels of recoil compensation.

Hemlock. This is technically a burst fire weapon by default but I don't use it like that so I'm just gonna talk about it's functionality as a single shot weapon. As a single shot weapon it acts as the younger brother to the scout. It has less per shot damage but fires considerably faster making it more consistent when hip firing. This is a great all-round primary weapon once you get it kitted out and represents a very generalist approach to weapons. Great addition. (Might be biased, this is my weapon of choice)

R-301. If the scout is the older brother to the hemlock, then the r301 is the older brother to the r99. It has a similarly high fire rate for its category but retains that fire rate out to much longer ranges and with a tighter spread allowing you to spray down opponents even out to medium range. Great addition, and a staple weapon of apex.

Havoc. The havoc rifle represents an odd niche of a weapon made for players who like to mess around with weird setups. The high damage offset by the windup rewards aggressive play and dedication to a push while also having the option to become a mini charge rifle to poke at people from afar. Don't know how I feel about this one.

Overall, the assault rifles are great mixed weapons with very high capabilities as primaries in almost all ranges. They struggle at the extremes of bothering ends but can hold their own in most scenarios. Great for general DM and great selection.

Moving on to sniper rifles:

Triple take. The triple take is a silly weapon, firing 3 roughly 20 damage pellets in a fan pattern and maxing out at 69 (nice!) body shot damage. This is almost a hybrid sniper shotgun, able to reliably chunk enemies in close range while also pestering enemies from afar. If you get a precision choke for the weapon it transforms from long range harassment to an extremely potent killer, popping 130 damage headshots out to extreme ranges. An odd, but very welcome weapon in apex. Great addition.

Longbow dmr. This was the most sniper-y sniper before the addition of the sentinel and represents a rapidly firing, high damage rifle with very high accuracy. If you can compensate for bullet drop, this weapon will reward you with easy downs on unaware players and rapid follow up shots to boot. Good addition.

Sentinel. The sentinel is a new weapon which illustrates that new weapons can fill previously unexplored niches in apex. While adding a sniper in an already sniper heavy meta may have been an odd choice, making it a bolt action with the possibility of pumping up the damage even more is a great decision. This weapon represents a more one-and-done type of weapon, downing even lightly injured opponents in a single headshot and finishing off players with broken shields easily. If you bodyshot someone with this weapon, they're easy pickings for an r99 magdump. Very good addition, if a bit (a lot) underpowered compared to the longbow.

Charge rifle. I hate this weapon. It illustrates the opposite of the sentinel which is that some niches should NOT be filled. This game has no need for a hitscan sniper rifle, especially not one that fires a bunch of annoying, slowing pre-shots that make it easier to line up shots on moving targets then ever before. Perhaps if the spread was less forgiving or it didn't allow scopes it would be less aggravating but as it stands this is an annoying weapon. Bad addition.

Kraber. Big daddy. This weapon has the highest per-pellet damage in the game, able to down players with full shields in a single headshot even with purple helmets (except for gibby) and easily gorging players on a body shot if you land center mass (except for gibby) but which is only dangerous in the hands of an experienced player who knows how to avoid getting sniped themselves. (Unless they're playing gibby)

Overall, snipers are amazing long range downing options that open up the map and allow you to heavily weaken teams from afar before they fight you. Due to their low fire rate, you're not going to wipe a squad at these ranges, but draining the enemy's health reserves is a good way to give your team an advantage before any fight.

frbe8t,Thesourlemon,Is Solo dropping away from team and looting a report-able offense?,"Hey guys, question in my title. Is it a report-able offense to drop solo and go loot somewhere away from your teammates? My thought was although it's very bad mannered in this team based game, I don't see how it can be a report-able offense when:

1). It is a game mechanic (I.E. the game lets you perform the action) to solo drop and you are still aiming for the objective to survive until the end and winning fights strategically as they come up. In fact, I would argue sometimes it may be required to solo drop if the drop master drops in a very hot location, it may be smart to drop in another location to avoid a low tier loot zone with a large number of squads dropping, as you have a low chance of surviving. Given the situation, another higher tier loot zone(s) may give you the greatest chance to survive to the end with good equipment.

2). I can understand why it may be frustrating, but this strategy is not the same as not reviving a downed teammate that you obviously can revive, intentionally not picking up a squad mate banner you can obviously pick up and willingly choose not to. 

3). The game objective is not similar to a game such as Overwatch, in the sense that if you are not contributing to a fight, you aren't helping your team, since the only objective of Overwatch it to kill the enemies. Since the reward/rank system in Apex Legends favors every squad you outlast, ultimately achieving victory by being the last squad alive, it can be beneficial to your rank to outlast other teams. I.E. helping your rank by not contributing to a low probability team fight.

Let me know what you guys think, I'm interested to hear your opinions.

**TL;DR I think solo dropping and looting is bad manners, but can't be a report-able offense since the rank system rewards outliving opponents. If that means going to un-looted zones and avoiding low chance of success team fights, it is actually the smart decision to solo drop and loot.**",8,1585509315,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/frbe8t/is_solo_dropping_away_from_team_and_looting_a/,apexlegends,1

fra782,hackedtochunks,Solo Queue is Unplayable Right Now,"Ever since last update I can hardly get any fair games, I get matched solo or in completely unfair lobbies. So today I wrote down all of my games.

Matched duo.

Matched solo.

Both low-level teammates.

Teammate quit as soon as downed.

AFK teammate

Matched duo.

Matched duo.

Level 10s and 27 against predator premade with over 2000 wins.

Matched duo.

Teammates quit before landing.

Matched with below level 10.

Matched solo.

More low levels in a predator lobby.

Finally a decent match.

Matched duo.

Solo.

Laggy server.

And then I turned the game off.

That is 13 terrible games before getting a fair match. This is completely unacceptable and Respawn should be embarrassed for the state of matching players. It's been bad before but this is the worst it's ever been.

Please fix this or many players will have to find another game, which will only cause more problems and more people abandoning the game.

Edit: And this isn't meant to hate on new players. I'm willing to help them if there are fair lobbies. The way it is now just isn't fun for the high-levels or the new players, they just get lasered and the high-levels have no challenge.

fra3ue,SirOrange01,A whole year since the release. And we are yet to have permanent duos or solos. And we only have two playable maps.,"Every other BR game I have ever played has a solo and duo mode besides the squad mode. It just gives you more choices to pick and play and is more fun if you are playing solo or duo and don't want random(s) in your team. I always hear the ''It will split the playerbase.'' sentence over and over and it is just an overused thing in my opinion. Any modern shooter or battle royale game has multiple modes with multiple maps. In a year we only got 2 maps and the only permanent mode that was available was the squads mode. Solos were just a LTM. This is just lack of gameplay content. Don't get me wrong I love Respawn. TF2 is one of my favourite shooters. Probably the perfect example to what a modern shooter should be like. Multiple modes with a variety of maps and loadout options. What we have in Apex feels like just the opposite of TF2. After a whole year what we had maps wise are only 2 playable maps and one is just playable in ranked right now. So you are forced to play WE if you want to play pubs and you are forced to play KC if you want to play ranked. And modes wise only a squads mode with some LTMs from time to time.

This game is in dire need of more variety. Playing the same maps over and over with a squad of three gets old after some time. I love this game but playing it with randoms feels like a chore and me and my friends aren't always online at the same time. So when I want to SoloQ I don't want to play with randoms. Or when I have only one friend with me we don't want to have a random in our team. I just want to be able to be more free while playing this game.  We have played strictly on WE for a whole season and it burned me out after a while. Same map same strategies same team comps... Same goes for the first season of KC.

This is my opinion. Feel free to agree or disagree with me. I will happily listen to your opininons and have more ideas from one of the most beautiful communities in the gaming scene right now.

fr9o8l,JoelRobbin,What if Legends had two passive abilities?,"I've seen some buff ideas floating around for some legends that involves giving them a new passive to replace their old one, but instead of replacing their passive, what if we gave Legends two passives? I brainstormed some ideas. In some cases (Gibraltar, Lifeline, Mirage and Wattson) I adapted some aspects of their tactical and turned them into passives, whilst for some Legends I did my best to come up with some entirely new concepts. These are just some ideas:


===BANGALORE===

Double Time: You move 1.33x faster when being shot at

Dexterity: You swap weapons and reload 1.5x faster than other legends (she's a weapons expert. Give her better weapon handling than the rest of them)



===BLOODHOUND===

Tracker: Enemies leave behind clues

Bloodlust: Enemies on 30hp or lower are visible through walls up to 30m away



===CAUSTIC===

Nox Vision: You see enemies through gas

Killer Instinct: Enemy health is visible through nox gas (credit u/Joshua_Bluemoon)



===CRYPTO===

Neurolink: Crypto and teammates see what a drone detects up to a 30 meter radius

Shield Transfer: Crypto's drone automatically refills his shields upon killing an enemy (as in the drone hacks the dead enemy's death box and instantly gived shields to Crypto)



===GIBRALTAR===

Gun Shield: Gibraltar has a 50hp shield that protects his face when ADS

Recover Under Cover: Consumables are used 20% faster when inside the dome of protection (just a concept adapyed from his tactical)



===LIFELINE===

Combat Medic: You have a bulletproof shield when reviving teammates

Speed Mrap: You use consumables 25% faster than other legends (May as well split these into two separate passives)



===MIRAGE===

Bamboozle: Enemies who shoot decoys have their location pinged for 10 seconds (just a concept adapted from his tactical)

Encore!: Mirage deploys a decoy and turns invisible for 5 seconds when knocked down 



===OCTANE===

Swift Mend: You heal health overtime when not in combat

Can't Stop Won't Stop: You are immune to slowing effects and falling lag (Octane says nothing slows him down. Let's make that the case)



===PATHFINDER===

Insider Knowledge: Pathfinder can scan survey beacons to reveal the next ring location

From the Sky: Pathfinder deals 30 damage when landing on an enemy after grappling (I couldn't think of anything for Pathfinder)



===REVENANT===

Stalker: Revenant crouch walks faster and can climb walls infinitely

Silent Assassin: Revenant's footsteps are 100% silent 



===WATTSON===

Spark of Genius: Ultimate accelerants instantly charge your ultimate

Security Breach: Enemies who pass through nodes are have their location pinged for 10 seconds (just a concept adapted from her tactical)



===WRAITH===

Voices from the Void: A voice tells you when you're in danger

Safety in the Void: You heal 5 health a second when in the void, tactical or ultimate (I couldn't think of anything for Wraith either)",10,1585503274,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fr9o8l/what_if_legends_had_two_passive_abilities/,apexlegends,5

fr9i9y,humblepups,Need help with upgrading PC to make Apex run well,"My PC is not the greatest, I'm operating on a combination of gear leftover from very old builds and new bits that I've been able to shell out for here and there. But it's still powerful enough for most games I play.

Apex however, has been a nightmare since day one. I've been playing apex since launch solidly, and it's the most inconsistently performing game I've ever played. **All I want is to AT LEAST maintain a stable 60fps.** I'm not looking for fps in the hundreds, a higher refresh rate monitor is on my shopping list but it's not a priority right now.

I can say that it's pretty barrable most of the time, and just walking around looting I can get like 80 - 110 average. But some tense battles with copious Bang smoke and Caustic farts, result in 20 fps, massive frame drops and adaptive resolution turning the game into abstract expressionism.

All of my settings are on low of course, drivers updated, and benchmarks say all my hardware is performing as to be expected so I need to know what I should upgrade.

I know that my CPU is the weak link here but obviously I'm stuck on AM3+ with my current motherboard. I recently made a very very minor upgrade from an AMD FX-6100 to a FX-4350 (3.3ghz to 4.2ghz), which gives me about a 10 higher average fps but I find that the game tanks while I have a discord call active...

So would upgrading to an AM4 board and a Ryzen CPU make a huge difference?

I've really not got a huge budget for upgrades, I've got student loan debt out the arse, but I'm desperate for a stable fps while I'm trying to improve at this game.

&amp;#x200B;

**My specs:**

**GPU= Nvidia GTX 970 4GB**

**CPU= FX-4350 4.2GHz**

**RAM= 8GB DDR3**

**HD= SSD 240GB**

**Motherboard= ASUS M5A78L-M**

&amp;#x200B;

I really need some recommendations for what would give me a decent enough boost in performance so that 60 FPS consistently isn't just a dream.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll mention as well that my partner just started playing a few months ago and she just upgraded to an RX 570 and an SSD but again, she's got all the same issues as me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Her specs:**

**CPU= FX-8120 3.1GHz**

**GPU= AMD Radeon RX-570**

**RAM= 16GB DDR3**

**HD= SSD 240GB**

**Motherboard= ASUS M5A78L-M**",1,1585502700,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fr9i9y/need_help_with_upgrading_pc_to_make_apex_run_well/,apexlegends,2

fr83pp,lanadelphox,What does it take to get good squadmates?,"I don‚Äôt know what it is, but I keep getting *hellish* squadmates to the point where ones who don‚Äôt piss me off are rare. I try to play with friends when available, but sometimes they aren‚Äôt so I just solo queue. It‚Äôs getting ridiculous, this is just a small list of things that have happened these past few days, most of them repeatedly.

1) I‚Äôm a woman, can‚Äôt go on mic with randoms until I can figure out if I‚Äôm going to be called a whore because I dared to open my mouth. Finally go on mic, get called a dumb bitch for avoiding it.

2) Octane stims into the vault, grabs everything of use. One squadmate grabs everything except a shield battery off a care package.

3) I‚Äôm jumpmaster, ping a location, I hear no complaints, yet I only realize when I drop that my squadmates have dropped solo/somewhere completely different. 

4) Jumpmaster wants to drop HOT HOT (Mirage, Fragment East, Train), disconnects the moment they get downed, despite me pinging that I‚Äôm gonna go retrieve them. 

5) Solo dropper continuously pings their banner when they get downed despite them being halfway across the damn map.

6) This is what inspired my post, happened in my last match. I got thirsted, my deathbox was in *very* close proximity to the respawn beacon, we were inside the ring. Pathfinder even set up a zipline so I could get to my deathbox! There were SIX other deathboxes (we got third partied, I had two kills in that encounter alone, so I wasn‚Äôt doing badly) and guess who‚Äôs box was looted? They had fine weapons. I understand needing shields or meds, maybe some ammo. But when I can easily get to my deathbox why the fuck would you take *all* of my ammo, my sights, mags, and shield? It was early game Fragment East, so most of it was looted from previous deathboxes and luck.

7) No spacial awareness. Idk about you guys, but if I‚Äôm going to die, I‚Äôd rather it be in a gunfight than the ring. Pinging jump towers doesn‚Äôt seem to work, what do you do there? Leave them behind, try to get them to listen to you?

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs platform or what. I play on PS4, my boyfriend plays on PC. I know I only recently started playing, but it seems like every other game my squadmates are doing the most infuriating things possible, while it seems like his shitty squadmates are much more rare. I don‚Äôt want to have to go to ranked just to have people that play the game as a team, as I said, I only recently started playing and I know I‚Äôm not the best player, but I try to at least be a really good teammate. I‚Äôll ping places before I go there and make sure they know where I‚Äôm going, I pay attention to what they need and try to find it for them, I *always* grab banners when I can, revive any chance I get, hell, I‚Äôve even given a respawned teammate my secondary weapon because a squad pushed us and they didn‚Äôt have a chance to loot first!

I‚Äôm sorry this was really long, I knew it was a rant but I‚Äôm a bit sleep deprived as well so it might seem like straight up word vomit. I appreciate you reading if you got this far though.

fr7me8,jonatanbaldvinsson,Premade squad member not loading into games (solution for console),"Recently I have encountered a bug that is apparently common. I squad up with a friend who then does not load into games with me.

So far we have figured out two ways to temporarily fix this bug

-One is for the guy that does not join the games to leave the squad and rejoin before the squad readies up.
-The second is to wait until the other members of the squad load into a game without you. They should then have an empty slot in the legend select screen where the third player should have been. The third player can join the game through playstation network before the others are out of the legend select screen, he should then have appeared in the squad by the time you get in the drop ship.

The most annoying thing is no matter which Method you use, it has to be repeated before each game. Nevertheless I hope this is helpful for anyone experiencing this bug.

fr7enk,dontsmoketheseeds,Apex Legends challenge system needs an update.,"It would be really nice if a couple things happened while completing challenges for the Battle Pass:

1.) Every time you complete one have a pop up really small on your screen letting you know you competed it. This would be nice for challenges where you have to get 10 knockdowns with the sentinel for example. After I get my 10th knock I‚Äôd like to know so I can swap that sentinel out since I suck with it. 

2.) Similar to number 1, as you progress it‚Äôd be nice while in game to see it go up as you get the extra knock or kill for that weapon, or whatever the challenge may be. 

3.) Cross off a week or give us a checkmark when you complete a week when viewing your challenges in the battle pass. I like to cross things off a list, I need that satisfaction. 

4.) Lastly, the challenges where I have to get however many knocks at specific locations... are the worst to me. I‚Äôve landed Drill Site like 10 times this morning while it wasn‚Äôt super out of the way and NOBODY is landing there. Maybe make it a single knock or a certain amount of knocks but just at one place not 5 spectate places for the one challenge.

fr7ado,Bam-Fucking-Boozled,"Hear me out, an idea: The ability to combine legend's tactical/ultimate abilities.","Such as, maybe.. (5 examples below, I dont expect any of you to read them all)

- Caustic tactical/Pathfinder ultimate:
The ability to quickly move a caustic trap a large distance. Only works on pathfinder zip lines, and must be a friendly pathfinder's zipline.

- Caustic ultimate/Bangalore tactical: Caustic's gas cloud can be increased in size as it essentially ""poisons"" her smoke, but if the gas disappears, the smokes return to normal. (Can not prolong )

- Bangalore ultimate/Gibraltar ultimate: When unleashed at the same time, (3 second period) creates a powerful mix between their ultimate, maybe a shape like Bangalore's, but the faster acting speed of Gibraltar's. 

- Crypto's ultimate/Wattson (This could just be with her in general, or her ultimate): Super-charged EMP, maybe do 75 or 100 shield damage instead, and go into health if they dont have shields. (Only to 50 health)

- Revenant ultimate/Wraith ultimate:
Allows you to immediately move via a portal available to ONLY your team once you respawn at the totem, to allow for better healing, or maybe an AWESOME flank behind the enemy team.

fr6usu,MoorGaming,Apex Legends the game that had potential.,"I like many top streamers have really began playing less of this game. If i had to put it simply its not fun, you play 10 games maybe 1 or 2 are fun the rest mostly bad games. I find it interesting that my stats are going up, while I feel like I die more to stupid things. I mean Apex has become the same thing over and over.

You fight you get third, or your team dies they leave and now your alone. In the current state of the game with no solos fights are 1 v 3 if you have no team most players dont need strategy to beat you, they simply all rush in throw abilities and bullets at you no matter if you knock 2 the last one may get you. 

There are times when you knock 2 full squads alone but you will eventually run into a team that you cannot 1 v 3 which makes sense. I have been playing less and less switching between COD and Apex. Honestly COD is fun but solos is just corner building campers. 

Apex is not much fun any more even if I try to just play some casual rounds I run into teams playing like its a 1 million dollar prize pool.

Im not going to sit here and say I think the game needs this or fix that, we have heard it all, this is just one guy saying I used to love this game but now playing it is just ok lets see how long before I turn it off.

fr6ql6,RightfulHeir,Can you please for the sake of anything isolate the sub lvl 50 players in separate lobbies?,"I know I'm beating a dead horse but I'm getting tired of this, I'm an average, or slightly above average player, level 500, hit diamond last season, with around 8k kills on all legends, and a lifetime KD of 1.25 and nothing fancier than 2.5k damage badge. And 80% of my teammates are less than level 50.

I try to be a decent teammate and don't leave when I see those players, just to be slapped with a god champion squad of preds with 10~20k kills and 20, 4k badges, and half the lobby having trails while my teammates don't even know how to loot. 

How is that fair for me or them? How should any of us have any sort of fun? They die instantly and just leave me in a 1v3 against people on a similar or even higher skill level. 

Out of 15 matches I played today, I had only 2 decent teammates in 2 separate matches and they weren't even so good, but they at least understood how the game works. Which I could not say for the other 18 who were ranging from level 3 to level 35

fr679h,kilos2,What Are Devs Doing,"No hype around map split, only for ranked? Why not normal games as well?

No changes to old map at all. (we know how good they are at making maps and locations on maps that works)

No rotating duos or solos.. The game feels stale really fast. We need some refreshing things to keep us going. 

Not enough recolors available, have to wait 7+ months for another recolro for your favorite weapon/skin etc.. especially for popular weapons. r99 avalance for example , last recolor 7-8 months ago.

Ranked was fun going from silver to platinum. Then it becomes infinitely harder and almost impossible to climb unless you find a team or invest tons of time. which is not worth it.

Dont get me wrong, they do an amazing job on some parts. I loved the changes to the survey camp, and capitol city, didnt like the harvester so much, felt a bit big.. They listen to feedback on muzzle flash, heirloom and much more. They do good work.

Just hoping for more improvements, thx. Maybe im asking too much or spoiled I dont know.

I just think rotating duos and solos need to happen actually. Or if someone have another suggestion how to keep the game fresh.

fr65kh,forhonorgold,Caustic buff ideas,"I think caustic suffers in being a defense class and i do believe as a caustic main that he should be as good as wattson in zoning or even better since he has a huge hitbox so what i would recommend to change the character is:
1-teammates doesn't get slowed in the gas and if that's too much then teammates can move with like 80%of their speed as well as caustic gas appearing red or blue to teammates 
2-caustic gas has a problem zoning ppl a lot of ppl can enter the gas kill caustic or revive their teammates and walk out like it's nothing so would make the gas starts its damage from 8 or maybe just start from 10 and stay at 10 but 4 is very very underwhelming and the other thing i would do is increase the radius of all his gas since in the open u really feel like u don't have any abilities u r just a huge legend that's super easy to shoot 
3-for his passive i would allow him to see enemies highlighted even after they leave the gas for like 5 seconds not necessary change but would kake his passive useful 
And as a quality of life change would make his vision better in his own gas and would fix the bugs with his gas like gas not doing damage to ppl on the other end of the door i hope these changes gets implemented soon since caustic was always a bad legend for a year now he never had his time to shine",34,1585489828,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fr65kh/caustic_buff_ideas/,apexlegends,1

fr5zie,BlankjustBlank,Thoughts after watching ALGS EU,"I just watched the ALGS EU 2nd online tournament in its entirety (3 and a half hours)  and I must say it was sooo amazing. First of I want to say how well apex is balanced right now. The fact that a CAUSTIC team won 2 TIMES is just awesome.  Its amazing how at the preseason invitational, we only saw 3 legends ( wraith-Pathfinder-wattson), and now in the algs we saw 6 (wraith-path-wattson-GIBBIE-CAUSTIC-BANGALORE) which means that half of all the legends are being used competetivly.  So yeah legend balance in competetive is really good right now, but the gun balance is really REALLY good as well. Obviously wingman, r99, PK were still the most used weapons, but there was a lot of Sentinels, Havocs, Flatlines, Triple takes and overall quite a lot of variety in weapon loadouts (compared to the preseason invitational). Also it was really fun seeing evo shields being used a lot. Also there was a gibraltar doing a finished to regain his shields which is really nice to see.

The point system is also amazing (the ratio between points per kill and per placement is just right)

&amp;#x200B;

The new spectator system really nice aswell, but there are some little bugs with it they have to fix like this one:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](51odqg4z6mp41)

The casters are really entertaining and they give off this nice intimate vibe (not in sexual way lol)

So yeah I really gotta give props to Respawn for making algs such a fun thing to watch and balancing the game to a such a good state.

Also my english is probably not perfect hope you understood everything. I would also love to hear what you guys think about the topic :D",4,1585488972,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fr5zie/thoughts_after_watching_algs_eu/,apexlegends,1

I can see a lot of reasons it might have slowed from general glitchyness to a greedy EA making the best updates for Premium players and in my opinion some of the new game modes being pretty lazy and uninspired compared to what fortnite has pulled for their specials. 

Still I hope EA switches up and sees they still have an awesome gem with a dedicated community if it isn't growing theres still opportunity to make it grow.",5,1585486105,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fr5eb4/is_apex_playerbase_still_growing/,apexlegends,1

//Ultimate

\-Probably the ""dencing party"" for the dummies big day.I think its better.

\-He cannot have damage for players whit his ultimate.But the ring can damage he

//Passive

\-I think he need a new passive.

\-But for the Dummis big day passive is better than the passive he have now.He can teleport loot for he.I think this is random but good.

**Absurd ranked penalties** - Penalties are being enforced on players who have no fault of the action mentioned. Whether it be no loss forgiveness for being solo, a teammate leaving, or for server issues.

**Legend Balance** - The legends aren't exactly the most contained. Wattson is the only legend you can say that is balanced.

**Skill based matchmaking** - The so called solution to player improvement. Having to verse against premade predator pro players.

**Glonk teammates** - A package that comes with SBMM, where you are to be playing with teammates who have almost no IQ in the game.

**Third parties** - The continuous non ending battles because of multiple teams engaged in that one fight.

**Servers** - The error filled servers that breaks the game constantly.

fr0fvq,Eternal_Suffering100,Octane buff idea,"Listen... i know this is probably like the 100th time you‚Äôve seen a ‚Äúbuff idea‚Äù post. They‚Äôve been done for multiple legends but i feel like octane is the most in need of love from respawn because every legend has there own special talent. However octane is pretty much a worse version of pathfinder. Path can get to the top of a building or travel several meters with a click of a button.

Other people have talked about buffs for octanes ultimate and passive. I dont want to claim any of those ideas as mine so i wont bring them up however i will be talking about his tactical 

Buff: Octanes tactical now lasts 8 seconds to provide a better opportunity to quickly escape in time or secure a kill/knockdown. in addition to that his stim makes him run 50% faster rather than 30. This will give him an edge over pathfinder in terms of horizontal movement (running forward backward etc) since he is supposed to be the fastest character in the game. The last buff for his tactical is to make it that while his stim is active, he jumps 50% farther and higher. I mean he is supposed to be really good at jumping, right?

Please let me know if you think this is too overpowered or not powerful enough. Thanks!",1,1585458867,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fr0fvq/octane_buff_idea/,apexlegends,1

fr0b0t,MoonshockaGaming,Plat Rank Lobby is full of nothing but 4k badge predators?,"So I got to platinum division 4 on like the first or second day of the season.

It seems to be all full of predators due to the soft reset

I can't or am having a hard time advancing,  I mean I can slowly gain RP but it feels like im working for AP points and only Earning Plat reward.  if that makes any damn sense.

debating taking a break from ranked for a little while   or maybe only going in to practice/improve

playing against esports teams can actually make you better vs esports teams, but sadly most of what you learn is not applyable in normal ranked or casual

&amp;#x200B;

cause ur enemy aitn nearly as good

I swear to god some of these games are fun tho ive died in like 11th place and like 16th place..

im the kind of player who gets 1st or top3 like 98% the time I play

&amp;#x200B;

so its actually amazingly refreshing to be defeated early oh man and in what order

lol some of these kills/deaths have been in the most obscure hidden secret locations that only like 0.1% of the fucking game even know about and low nad behold some mother fucker is already there when I rotate or they just come by to check it out later, I m honestly impressed cause in season 1 this shit never happen period.  I guess what im noticing is that Apex predators themselves have gotten better at the game lol

&amp;#x200B;

anyhow sorry to rant,  while I do enjoy the competition of apex predator 4k squads,  I do think its lame dealing with it in lower elo matches,  god damn I think diamond division 2 or 1 would be appropriate maybe but not down herei n fucking plat 4 lol , im sorry but losing RP in plat 4 , because 3 4k predators shat on u  is bullshit

on the flip side earning like 16 rp vs predators and only barely moving up to plat 3 is also lame lol

&amp;#x200B;

long story short I might stop farming RP till the soft reset has rebalanced,  in the meanwhile I can hot drop and play like crazy man vs these preds",5,1585458254,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fr0b0t/plat_rank_lobby_is_full_of_nothing_but_4k_badge/,apexlegends,1

In PUBG, I love the map Erangel, but I also really like Sanhok. Instead of each one being on rotation, I can play them at any time I want. So if this was the case for Apex Legends, wouldn't the KC and the WE beef thing be stopped?

fr0ajy,Rel1ik,"I love this game, but it's making me sad","Hi, long story short I love this game and have been playing it a ton since its inception.  I believe it's fair to say that I have a lot of experience in the game: I'm level 500, have been diamond ranked last 2 series, and have over 1400hrs played. This game has been my biggest hobby this past year, and I couldn't be more grateful for the countless hours of fun its provided. Anyone who's been in this game as long as I have can tell you though, that the path this past year has not been a bed of Roses. But none the less, we kept playing because we loved the characters, the weapons, the lore. THE FINISHERS!!! And I put my money were my mouth was: over all, ive spent over $900 on apex since its release. I was fortunate to have a great job with disposable income, so to me I was just investing in my main hobby and giving back to the developers. I was investing in making the game BETTER. 

But now I feel like I'm at a breaking point. I'm a Caustic main who's almost at 5K kills. I was so excited to get there, but I think I have to stop. The game's been making me so frustrated and sad. There are so many little things that I just cant believe are issues still, things that I was hoping the investments from whales like me would have helped fix by now.

1. Hitboxes: Revenant feels like hes made of tissue paper because he's absolutely huge and for some reason low profile too. Granted, hes completely new so hopefully this (along with his ultimate being trash) will get updated at some point.  HOWEVER, on the opposite spectrum we have Wraith.  Shes been here since the beginning. I honestly cant believe shes still allowed in this game in her current form.  It's absolutely mind blowing to me that they allow a character who has some of the best abilities in the game to also have BY FAR the smallest hitbox. Shes so disgustingly small; you could take away all of her abilities and she'd still be one of the top legends in the game. Just give her a wingman and watch her zip zap back and forth.  I thought by now they would have increased her size a little bit to make her more fair. Also, I hate that one feels pressured to play her (or pathfinder) just to be able to compete. Every large apex tourney has had almost exclusively wraith and pathfinders on every team. Doesn't respawn see that as an issue? Dont they want diversity? I guess this past year I was willing to look past it, thinking that eventually they'd fix this atrocious power level discrepancy. But now it seems evident that they dont care about that. They dont care that even in casual lobbies it's almost completely pathfinders and wraiths.

2. Other glitchy crap: I have a very good computer and very fast internet. So I can assure you that ""it's not me, its you"" when it comes to weird shit happening in this game. For instance: FUCKING DOORS.  I feel like since day one there has been something glitchy with the doors in this game where sometimes I'd get stuck in them even though they're open. (In fact, one such occurence happened today, which inspired me to write this post. I was playing Caustic. I know he's THICC, but he ain't ""getting stuck in door frames"" thicc).  SHOTS NOT REGISTERING. Cant tell ya how many times I'll see a wingman or sniper bullet hit someone with blood splatter yet no numbers/damage happens.

3. Footsteps: I've died so many times to not hearing an enemy character running up behind me. I have Senheiser gaming headphones, so again, I doubt it's me that's the issue. This is also one of the major complaints I hear from my friends who play the game. And I feel this goes beyond footsteps: many times I've died from pathfinders grappling to my location, but I couldn't even hear the grapple.

4. Caustic specific: like I said, I'm a Caustic main. The moment I logged in for the first time and saw his Blackheart legendary skin and listened to his voice quips, I was spell struck. However, he does place a large burden on my teammates at times, especially inexperienced players. I dont know what the appropriate change would be, but if something could be done to make it easier for Caustic's teammates to work with him, that would be fantastic. 

In short: I dont want to feel like I'm shooting myself in the foot by not playing wraith. I wanna feel like I'm shooting someone else in the foot when I actually am shooting them in the foot (Or anywhere on their body for that matter...). I would also like to hear those feet as the walk around. And last but not least: Caustic is awesome.",30,1585458192,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fr0ajy/i_love_this_game_but_its_making_me_sad/,apexlegends,1

fqz6g1,temporadraconisPS4,New Gold Backpack Perk Idea,"Currently, with Season 4 the backpack perk is actually perfectly fine. But, as the leaks have been stating, we are getting a brand new set of class passives that will come in handy. Defense characters are the only ones that need to be mentioned here as their new class passive is to revive people with one shield pip. Which means that the code of the G-pack will be changing along with the class codes. I actually thought about what kinds of battles we've all had and the times where we ACTUALLY use the G-pack. Most of the time, the backpack is left unused unless it is an early-game acquirement. However, there have been fights I've lost because I had to reload, and the animation took too long, so I died.

My suggested perk change would be something that might require new unique animations. The perk could become ""Weapon Specialist"" instead of ""Guardian Angel"" as it would allow you to reload ALL weapons faster, as well as holstering/swapping weapons for better handles on gunfights. One, this would be far more useful, and two, this perk would be pretty difficult to actually get. I don't know how often the rest of you loot a G-pack, but I leave it be if I am not playing Lifeline or Gibby. Season 5 will make me only pick it up if I use Lifeline as I already get the perk from playing Gibby, Wattson, or Caustic in S5.

I have worked on Lifeline's abilities already with my own personal video, that I will post at the end. And I think that this perk idea would be better if my Lifeline fixes are good enough to be put in game. While I'm at it, why don't I explain the animation thing.

If you reload a weapon at a faster speed, the animation will play faster, but some weapons don't have this, and speeding up their animations might feel a bit awkward. I'm looking at you PK. However, this perk could be easily explained by changing the speed reload animation tied to the G-pack. The R-99 would have the animation use a mag in your character's hand as they go to reload the weapon, then a quick 1-2 of you swapping the mags before you just drop the empty mag onto the ground as you go back to shooting. The PK would have you clipping right past the empty shells as you loaded the next rounds into the shotty. The Havoc and Wingman would have similar ones, but I've also thought about characters.

Perhaps when using a specific character, you could use that speed-reload with a unique animation very rarely. Much like the skull activation for the Death Totem. Wattson could electrocute the weapon, while Wraith simply drops it into a portal before it comes back through a portal, reloaded. Lifeline pulls out a mini care package with a new weapon in it, Revenant smashes his weapon with the skull, Bangalore adds a random snap, Gibby creates a shield around his weapon with a small shield generator, and Octane just kind of throws his weapon away and kicks a new one from off the ground into his hands. Either way, the perk should become this, just because I want to see some sweaty players get wrecked by someone speed-reloading a PK to pop in their face.

This is labelled as a discussion because I want to know if this is a good idea.",3,1585453351,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqz6g1/new_gold_backpack_perk_idea/,apexlegends,1

fqypil,_j4k,Some balance changes to some legends I thought would be cool (*MY OPINION*),"Caustic - make teammates immune to your own gas (no speed reduction)

Octane - when using tactical, give nearby teammates a slight speed boost (like Lucio from Overwatch)

Mirage - make decoys actual bots that move with the team, and for the ult, get rid of all the clones except for one (which would be a bot)

Gibby - replace fast heals and fast revives for passive hp healing (like Wattson's ult)

Wattson - make fences go away after a minute, then start its cool down

Wraith - get rid of her tactical while using her ult 

Revenant - slightly increase ult hp, radius, and allow yourself to go back to it at will

Pathfinder - slight grapple cool down increase",3,1585451395,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqypil/some_balance_changes_to_some_legends_i_thought/,apexlegends,1

fqxwu2,MysticMeerkat,Lets talk about the legends and how we can make them better,"Hi everyone, my name is Meerkat and I wanna talk to you guys about what I would do to make the current legends in apex legends better. I know we all have our different takes on what we would change and i would like to share mine starting with my current favorite legend to play bloodhound

Blood hound- I actually think bloodhound is in a very very good spot in both ranked and pubs. the only thing i would rework is their tactical or Q as you all like to call it. I like the idea of every legend being able to damage other people without needing a weapon kinda like how Revenant, Bangalore, caustic, and Wattson can. the way i would do this is to give them the pulse blade from titan fall and this was actually suggested from the gaming merchant so shout out to him. the pulse blade when thrown would do 10 damage to the body on a direct hit and would then scan for enemies. if the knife hit an opponent then the enemy would be scanned for much longer than a normal scan would. if the knife hit a wall then it would scan for enemies in the direction you threw it. let me know what you think about this change!

Gibraltar- Gibby is by far my least played legend (i literally have like 15 kills on him) but i do know that hes one of the most annoying legends to face. a change i would make is to make it so that the dome shield has a health. maybe 300-500 heath for starters this way  with enough fire power you can break the shield. his ultimate is fine, annoying but fine and his passive should go down to 30 hp from 50. i know a few of you will say ""oh that will kill gibby"" it wont. i promise you.

Lifeline- I actually just started maining lifeline and i love her a lot. a few changes i would make is to make her health drone heal all the health to a squad and to make it heal faster. her ultimate is a good idea on paper but i really think it should guarantee purple armor since that's what people need the most. her 25% healing faster passive is fine and her heath drone should protect over and under you as well when reviving.

PathFinder- pathfinder is a fine legend, same with wraith and i dont wanna nerf them really because theyre in such a good spot but if i was to change anything about pathfinder it would be to make his passive be able to repair himself while crouched kinda like bastion from overwatch. he would slowly regain health when he was crouched down and would do like a little animation to show hes repairing himself. this way all tracker legends can use survey beacons.

wraith- wraith is fine, i dont think she needs a change

bangalore- bang is fine, shes a great legend and a fun one if you know how to play her

Caustic- oh boy big daddy caustic. i personally have a bit of a hatred bias towards caustic so i may be a little harsh on him. let me know in the comments if i went too far. caustic should get his gas canisters lowered from 3-2 canisters and his gas damage should go up from 6-8 damage per tick. i also want his gas traps to make a beeping sound before going off (kinda like his ultimate). his ultimate is fine, annoying but fine. also make it so that teammates  arent slowed by gas and a clear color diffence from your gas and enemy gas

Mirage- god where do i start. mirage is hands down the WORST legend to play. sure if you give mirage to aceu he'll get kills cause hes aceu but to anything else hes the worst character. lets start with  his passive. first off make his passive to where cloaks himself but you can still see the outline of him while reviving or healing. his tactical is fine but he should have 3 decoys that you can use but take 25 seconds to recharge one. along with that, make it so that he can cycle out one of his teammates as a decoy. and give him the dummies big day ultimate PLEASE

Octane- my main, i have alot of changes that i want to him. lets first talk about how stim works in titanfall. stim would give you a boost in speed and double the regeneration speed. i want it to be like that with some addition changes. stim would give you 40 HP over a 8 second period (5HP per second) and boost your speed up to 50% movement from 30% current speed on an 12 second cooldown. on top of that i would make it so that while stimmed, octane revives 25% faster (it makes sense) that way he has a team play. i would change his jump pad to do the double jump idea that mokeysniper came up with. for his passive i would remove his current passive and make it so he runs at the same speed as holstered when running with a gun out. this was suggested by another reddit user but i cant remember their name.

Wattson- wattson needs a nerf not because shes OP cause shes not, shes just BORING. shes a must have in any highly competitve play. what i would do is change her passive from what it is rn to take 50% less damage while in the ring (she made it after all). this way this encourges storm fights and makes it so much less campy. also change her fences to hold 2 fences from 4 and keep her ult as is but make it so whith the ult you can only place down 8 fences from 12 as well as allowing her ult to charge up other ults 10% faster. this discourages less camping and encourges more fighting.

Crypto- i wanna completely rework crypto change everything from his passive, tactical, and keep his ult... kinda. for crypto passive he should see how much health an opponent has when ads. hes a hacker, he can hack the game. this way a good crypto will learn when to and when not to take fights. his tactical should be revenants tactical where he throws out the data knife and it hacks opponnents abilities for 15 seconds along with doing 10 damage on impact. and his ultimate should be the drone. the drone should have infinite health but have a 35 second battery that can see enemies through walls. a wall hack essentially but only he can see it in his drone. once he exits his drone those wall hacks fade away making it balanced

revenant- i like his passive but he should climb a little higher and faster. i want to change his ult and tactical completely. his tactical would be the shadow form for 25 seconds but for just revenant. while in shadow form he has an infinite climb and a 30% faster move speed and only health on a 55 second cooldown. you can choose to exit shadow form whenever you wish but if you die while in shadow form you come back as yourself from the sky with nothing but your dignity. no gun, no armor, just you and your health. this would put the ""defy death"" correctly into his name. for his ultimate would be his tactical but on steroids. when you ult you make your entire team as a shadow for 25 seconds (they can still exit whenever they wish) giving them infinite climbing and 30% faster movement speed and only health but if they die while in shadow form then they all come back from the sky like if you restarted the game.

so these are my ideas for all the legends in apex legends. please do not hesitate to leave your thoughts in the comments, negative or positive ill read them and try to respond. thank you all for reading and im out.",9,1585448234,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqxwu2/lets_talk_about_the_legends_and_how_we_can_make/,apexlegends,1

I mean the game itself is ass, but from an engineering standpoint its impressive. Then there's APEX, where just firing your gun evokes muzzle flash that drops FPS severely.

fqx4fy,Contact2028,The reason this game is losing players so fast.,"I been lurking this this sub for awhile now. And I see so many posts talking about what respawn needs to do to ""fix"" this broken game. Broken this broken that.. Blah blah blah. Lemme tell you what's fkn ruining this game. YOU. Not respawn, not hit boxes, not nerfs or buffs YOU. Yes you, Mr/Mrs. I'm gonna 1v3 this team rq. Tbh the gameplay is fun fast and free. The only place respawn fuct up was making players play ranked with morons. This game is 80% tactics 10% skill 10% playing with ppl you know. Here's a list of things you can do to stop this games decline: 1: stop hot dropping when you don't know how to drop hot and die immediately. 2: Stop solo dropping. 3:Revive before you loot. If you just got a couple kills and you are the last one standing and your team is down revive/respawn before you loot. You will never survive even if you kill that squad you think you can 1v3.  Dudes wanna loot for 15 mins before revive. Yeah ik ik ur gonna die if you do. You will die if you don't. When you wait that long revived teammate is useless bc they are naked coming in and will be trying to find weapons and ammo while you are engaging mr. I gotta purple shield right off the bat. 4: Stop engaging just bc you see a team. Idk how many times I see idiots engaging a team on a rooftop or across the map with non-range weaponry. Even with the 301 or flatline and anvil rec it's still not a good idea. You draw huge amounts of attn with all that gun fire. Next thing you know your balls deep in a pinch between two or more squads. I could literally go on and on... But I won't. I'm switching games strictly bc I can't play with fkn morons anymore.  COD isn't as good for BR but they have a solo game mode. No more relying on fkn dumbasses. End of story.

They told me its my nat type 2 issue which i tryed my best to solve but i couldnt my isp said opening one port would cost 10 dollars..

Even tho i dont think its a port issue cause firstly i could play every game fine and i can play apex legends fine in pc with friends no issues. 

My Internet is fine isnt the shittest internet out there. 


My issue is :

When i join or get invited to a party in the game. i click join then nothing happens but sometimes my friends sees me in the party and sometimes not or i would join but wont be able to ready or i would ready but my friend isnt ready but actually he is ready and when we are 3 people 2 others would join normally but me i will stay in the lobby cause the same thing happens were i cant ready up

fqwtep,dillonmccarthy,Got a tough one for ya,"Howdy friends, I have a question for y‚Äôall about running apex legends. If this isn‚Äôt allowed, I‚Äôm really sorry, Mods feel free to remove this post.
So I‚Äôve never been much of a PC gamer, but recently I invested in my first ever gaming PC, partly because of Apex legends. I had previously been playing it on my laptop, a Lenovo yoga that didn‚Äôt even have a graphics card and has like 4 gigs of ram so it didn‚Äôt run great but it was enough to get me hooked. I now have a PC with an Intel I7 4770 processor, 16gbs of ram, and a Nvidia GTX 980 graphics card. I‚Äôve been playing Civ 6 and Minecraft and some other games with no issues, but when I play Apex, every so often a strange thing will happen. Out of nowhere, the screen will turn black and my monitor, though not powered off, will receive no input from my computer. My computer also won‚Äôt turn off, and, if what my buddies tell me is true, I don‚Äôt leave the game, I just have no way of knowing what‚Äôs going on. The only way to fix this problem is to turn the computer off and back on again.
I‚Äôve installed and reinstalled all my graphics drivers so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not that, and I‚Äôve turned down my settings which seems to reduce the frequency of this problem but not eliminate it. Does anybody have any tips about what this problem is and how to solve it?
Thanks.
Ps: sorry if I got any terminology wrong or if something needs clarification, I‚Äôm still new to PC gaming.",1,1585444081,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqwtep/got_a_tough_one_for_ya/,apexlegends,1

fqwpdg,Battle_Royale_Nation,I would love to hear from the devs on why solos have not been added...,"Anyone who ever plays with randoms knows why solos are needed. Teammate rush‚Äôs into a 1v3 because he thinks he‚Äôs TSMViss, gets downed and DCs immediately. If he doesn‚Äôt DC immediately, he gets on the mic calling his teammates trash and pinging the holy crap out of his box until he finally DCs. 

Players like this don‚Äôt have the patience or the want to work together as a team to push together or worry about things like positioning that can often be the difference in a fight. I‚Äôm not blaming them really because if they love the game, they have no other option to play except for squads. 

The fast paced style of Apex is second to none in the BR universe in my opinion and I understand people just wanting to play until they die and jump into a new game. Maybe they die off spawn and load back into a new match. Maybe they drop 15 kills and actually win. If we had solos, they could spawn and die until their eyes bleed and players that want to work together could have a mode to ourselves to do that. 

I get that it‚Äôs a team based game but not everyone has a team they play with everyday. Most of us fall into one of two categories. Push like you have dynamite up your ass that‚Äôs gonna explode if you don‚Äôt or players that want to communicate with their squad and work together. Why get we get a mode for both?",20,1585443654,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqwpdg/i_would_love_to_hear_from_the_devs_on_why_solos/,apexlegends,0

I feel like the solution is simple. Every other BR has a solo and duo mode. Why not apex? The queue times are sub 20 seconds I would gladly wait a minute for a duo queue and I think that we may find that more people will play apex if they can chose between squads and duo.

fqwgtn,Elvesareop,Everyone Sucks At Balancing,"Firstly let me go ahead and say that Respawn isn't any better than anybody else because a lot of Respawns balance changes have entirely backfired.


I don't mean to bash anybody, but I continuously see people constantly posting Nerfs and Buffs and balancing ideas.

90% of which are actually quite unbalanced, and in most cases broken beyond belief, there been a lot of Octane buff posts lately, Mirage too, and I agree they both need Buffs.


But let me be painfully honest, y'all ideas are trash and would ruin the game, it's almost like some people want to give every character the Giby treatment. And I'm not saying that they're bad ideas in general I'm just saying that they're bad ideas for this game, who knows maybe they would be good in another game.


Something that I noticed is that posters will often focus on the elements of a character's kits that are often the most obnoxious or already fine on it's own.


For example, somebody wanted to make Revenant's distortion effect more intense and last longer and also slow you. I already know a great deal of people who would immediately quit the game if that was a thing, primarily because arc stars are bad enough.

Somebody also wanted to make Octane be able to swap weapons faster than everyone else, while it's a good idea in theory it would be a disaster in reality. And it would ultimately make stocks useless to him, considering that's their secondary function.

Two equally matched players playing different characters, one playing Octane and one playing anybody else would no longer be equally matched, the Octane would win for obvious reasons.

I'm a Wattson main, but I absolutely shuddered at the  suggestion that Wattson could carry around her ultimate on her back, and also was able to throw the grenades back at the enemy. In my personal opinion Wattson is already pretty balanced, she could use some quality of life changes to her fences but other than that she's pretty balanced.


Edit: also I know this is going to get downvoted into Oblivion, because people don't like hearing the harsh truth. I don't want to discourage anybody from suggesting ideas I just want to let people know that a lot of these ideas are not realistic.",5,1585442776,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqwgtn/everyone_sucks_at_balancing/,apexlegends,0

fqv3ga,Kolatsz,3rd parties (and how to reduce them),"This game is phenomenal, the movement, gun play, everything is amazing. The 3rd parties however are ridiculous, especially on ranked (which is where most my judgement will be based).

I love how the ranked play system works because it gives genuine reason to get good and grind the game, but because everyone wants kills (which I‚Äôm not saying is wrong) it‚Äôs means that you‚Äôll end up getting swarmed by teams as soon as you start a gun fight with someone. 

I propose 2 fixes that I believe would reduce 3rd partying by a lot and in turn would make ranked play more about tactics and survival rather than rushing and gunskill( when I say survival I don‚Äôt mean camping out the game, it would just reduce the rushing)

Fix 1: Make a larger map -

I don‚Äôt know the development side of how possible this would be but a larger map would mean more ground to cover between teams, thus making it less likely to have 2 to 3 teams waiting to push you. Also Kings Canyon is a bit stale now in my opinion and I think the game would really benefit from a new environment, just not a Worlds Edge type environment.

Fix 2: Reduce how far away you can hear gun shots - 

I think this would be the more realistic fix and would also be relatively easy to do. You can literally hear gunshots on the other side of mountains...like do I need to say more. The map isn‚Äôt huge I know but that doesn‚Äôt mean the gunshot audio range should be. If it was made so that other teams would only hear you from half the current distance then I think the number of teams waiting to clean up the scraps would be significantly lower.

If you too the time to read this, thanks it took me ages to type lol.",4,1585437852,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqv3ga/3rd_parties_and_how_to_reduce_them/,apexlegends,0

fquobv,Skyyfall31,I‚Äôve gone too far...,"I‚Äôve never been addicted to a video game before. Apex for some reason has taken a hold on me like nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life.
            
It‚Äôs the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I‚Äôm doing before I go to bed. Grinded my ass to get to diamond before the split and for some reason I still didn‚Äôt get the feeling of accomplishment.

But... it never was an issue until 2 nights ago. I got drunk playing some board games with my roommates and started playing late night. I main wraith, and have always wanted her heirloom. So I‚Äôm like, FUCK IT,  I‚Äôll drop $60 to try and get it. That‚Äôs just the price of a new videogame, and I‚Äôm supporting the developers right?

Well I didn‚Äôt get it.

Felt confident, figured I must‚Äôve at least gotten close considering I‚Äôm level 300. Might as well drop another $100.... 

Nothing.

At this point, I‚Äôm conflicted. I‚Äôve already dropped $160, and have nothing to show for it. What‚Äôs another $100? I‚Äôm getting a check for $1200 in the mail from the government in like a couple weeks right?

So I drop another $100, and as I sift through each of the 115 packs I start sobering up more and more. Reality begins flooding in. I‚Äôm opening them slower and slower the deeper I get in.

Next thing I know, I‚Äôm down to the last 25 packs of my $260 purchase. All I can think about is, wow, I‚Äôm 22 years old and I just paid almost $300 for a VIRTUAL VIDEO GAME SKIN. I‚Äôm in school full time with a 3.6 gpa at a great college, and I spent $300 DOLLARS FOR A SHITTY E-KNIFE.

It‚Äôs 4 am now, and I‚Äôm down to the last 6 packs. By this point I‚Äôve both accepted that it‚Äôs not happening, and that if it does happen it means absolutely nothing .

Pack number 4, and I get it. I‚Äôm in my boxers,  hunched over staring at the bright screen without even a smirk on my face as I squint at the red lights jet out of the loot tick. I buy her Kunai, crawl into bed and stare at the ceiling for about 2 hours. 

Well, I‚Äôve officially decided that after this purchase, it‚Äôs time for a solid 2 week break from Apex. I‚Äôve always considered myself a fairly rational person, so I can‚Äôt even begin to fathom why I thought this was a good idea. $300 is a custom scuff controller, or a full trip to Cabo, or half a month‚Äôs rent, or a potential million other things. 

Moral of the story, it turns out I‚Äôm the reason Respawn makes as much money as they do without charging for the game.

tldr: Got drunk, spent almost $300 trying to get the Kunai, taking a solid break from Apex.",13,1585436421,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fquobv/ive_gone_too_far/,apexlegends,4

fqtdjt,burningderp,"Yes Origin Is down, but this exposes a far bigger issue","As many of you are finding out, Origin is down. But something I don't think any of us expected is an empty library.

It turns out if the ORIGIN server is down then the launcher will ignore all locally installed games. Including games that can be played offline. This begs the question..Who owns your library?

If we look at League, when their in game ""store"" goes down you can still play the game. When their ""friends list"" goes down you can still play the game. When a specific game mode goes down you can still interact with the store and friends. Fundamentally because the League client aggregates multiple servers into one place.

Is this not the same with Origin and all their games? Or does Apex Legends use the same servers as Titanfall and as Anthem and as their store. Seems like really poor design to have every single game on one server instance. But why are all my single player games missing? I paid for those. Like steam shouldn't I be able to play offline?

If I don't own what I paid for, I can't in good conscience spend any more money in Origin.

If any dev sees this post, please ignore the questions above and answer this for me. Why are you guys so hell bent on ruining your own games? Its been 4 odd months with that stupid dropship bug.

(Edit) Since I've been playing I've seen exactly one gold item(a helmet). That is ridiculous. Even if there is only one gold shield in the entire game then that makes that item even more op. Being able to loot efficiently is a skill neccessary for the game too.

My windows and drivers are up to date. I ran a UOtrace and couldnt see any issues. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game, created a new account, changed languages, cleared my DNS, cleared my origin cache, changed data centers, verified my game files, rebooted my modem/router - nothing helped. I've done everything but reinstall windows. I don't understand why this is only happening for me but it's making me lose my mind - i have more time now than ever to play this game, and i can't play it. Is there anything else i can do? how much more money do i have to spend on this game to get my name added to the whitelist of players who dont get code net errors? my birthday is tomorrow and all i want is to be able to play again. please someone help:/",2,1585424239,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqqvef/havent_been_able_to_play_in_4_days/,apexlegends,3

fqqldh,Avikrto,What is your thoughts on current Anti cheat system and Reporting system ?,I Personally feel like this system doesn't work as it should. Diamond+ games are mostly filled with Aim botters. After reporting the hacker they again show up next day or in few matches. I even have videos recorded but I don't know what good would even it do by showing it to anyone. Its annoying because I love playing Apex Legends and it makes me lose respect for higher rank or actual good players. I'm writing this here because I don't know how to how to tell Respawn that their cheat system doesn't work. I feel like I'm back in Season 1 because this has became literally everyday now.

Here is the worst 

1. No communication. If you are not ready to talk or at-least mark or ping items/enemies, what is the point?  I  understand that many can't talk because they have no HW, parents don't allow it or disabled. But game provides a mechanism to co-ordinate and use it as much as you can. This is team sport guys
2. You don't drop on your own in a completely different area and then ask for help when you are down. This is team sport guys
3. When your team mate is in a fight, you immediately go and help. Don't continue to loot as if nothing is happening. This is team sport guys
4. When your team mate is down and there are no enemies around, revive them first. We lost so many games because last remaining team mate decided to loot rather than reviving. Death boxes don't disappear or fly away. This is team sport guys
5. It is not about kills and it is about winning. Don't get upset if someone stole your kill. This is team sport guys

I understand people play for fun and I do as well. Since there is no solo, try and play as a team.",5,1585421500,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqq0yi/saturday_morning_thoughts/,apexlegends,2

fqpb05,GachiPls_DidntSave,Something needs to be done about deathbox camping.,"Not sure what and not sure how but man oh man is it a problem. EVERYONE does it nowadays and its such a cheap tactic but it makes perfect sense why everyone does it.

Why go looking for the other members of the squad when you can just set up camp for 2 minutes and wait for them to come to you? I've also been seeing more aggressive and sweaty players try the ""leave and come back 30 seconds later"" tactic to try and make you think they're leaving when really they just want that sweet easy kill.

Why is it a problem? Because its an unhealthy habit that effects the playstyles of everyone else in the game. If your teammates die and you try going for their banners as safely as you can there's a very low chance you will get the banners AND survive due to this tactic. There's really only 2 choices in these situations: Go solo or just flat out leave the game and join another to save time for everyone.

*Edit: I'm a solo queuer. Yes, obviously if my team stuck together this wouldn't be much of a problem but unfortunately I can't control the actions of my teammates and they don't listen to me that often. And I'm not doing LFG to try and fix that either, that shit is harder than getting a legitimate job. Not to mention the people ""hiring"" me are far more delusional.*",6,1585419198,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqpb05/something_needs_to_be_done_about_deathbox_camping/,apexlegends,0

fqosmo,NamingThingsSucks,Inconsistent matchmaking for squadmates in solo queue/casual?,"Not a sbmm post. I am neither for nor opposed to sbmm. 

My problem is that recently my teammates when queuing solo seem to be random, but matchmaking will then be based on my skill. 80% of the time my teammates are equivelant skill masters/diamond players and the game is fine. 

But the past few weeks I am getting a wide range of teammates, on multiple occasions 2 clearly new players, but put in my normal lobbies. This is NOT a case where they are smurfs/new accounts. You can tell they have barely played the game. 

Each time I noticed new players in my squad when I was killed I made a point to watch the other squads after and they have had full squad of 4k/20 kill hundreds of season 4 win badges. So it's not a matter of everyone in the lobby having mismatched squads.

I have solo queued for a long time and other than occasionally getting one new player who had queued as a duo with a skilled friend, I have never gotten sp many squadmates of mismatched skill level until recently. 

Tldr: I'm ok with sbmm but I think sometimes matchmaking is failing at a squad level? Anyone else?",1,1585417620,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqosmo/inconsistent_matchmaking_for_squadmates_in_solo/,apexlegends,1

Then if we try pubs the shit matchmaking just throws us against only predators and gives us shit teammates. At this point I only come back to the game just cos my friends want me to.
And to top it all off all the bugs that make the game near unplayable as well makes it even more frustrating. It just feels like land, get shit loot, die to apex preds, then rinse and repeat.

fqnvj4,djmitchell705,Legend Balance Part 1 (Bangalore),"Welcome to the start of my legend balance series. These post are here to share my opinion how the legends should be buffed so they can all be useful for ranked instead of having to have a tier list to see which legend sucks and which one is good. I wanted to do Bangalore first since she is basically the default legend.

                                                

                                    Bangalore's playstyle:

I want bangalore to be able to fill in any playstyle because I want her to be the ""Jack of all trades"" but master of none kind of class, which fits with her military personality and abilities. That means she can fit into an offensive or defensive team or if you don't know who to choose, pick Bangalore. She'll be very beginner friendly but she'll also still be very good for the big leagues.


                                      Buff/Changes:


Passive: I would keep the 30% speed when being aimed/shot at but I'll also add another that allows her to reload 10% faster (or a number that keeps it balanced). 

The reason for this is because she is a soldier and knows the weapons more than anyone else in the game. This passive allows her to be mobile while also having an advantage in reloading in battle. The reload speed is unique to her but her speed is outmatched by Pathfinder and Octane (I'll be doing octane next so it makes sense), but that's why she is the Jack of all trades master of none.


Tactical: Her tactical is honestly not that bad. It blocks the enemie's vision and can be used defensively or offensively which I want to keep like that which makes her such a balanced character. The only downside is that it also blinds your teammates. The difference I would make is that it is slightly more visible than the enemie's. The enemy's vision of the smoke stays the same tho but only slightly I dont want it to completely overhaul the use of digital threat or bloodhound's abilities. The real buff her is to bit. I want to encourage people to hit other's with Bangalore's smoke. So I would slightly buff the hitbox so it can kinda hit multiple people, the damage stays the same, but if you hit someone they'll also be dazed and slowed for a few seconds just like her ultimate. This tactical will now be used for offensive purposes and defensive purposes but can be countered by some things like bloodhound's tactical, digital threat, or octane who will not be slowed when stimmed.


Ultimate: Her ultimate is really good for crowd control, going on the defense or offense and I want it to make it better. The time it takes to explode will be reduced a bit. People should still be able to have a chance to escape but it should also punish people who don't escape in time. That means it'll also daze them, blurring their vision, and slowing them down for an extended time (unless it's octane who's stim makes him not slowed but still gets the daze effect so he still can't see). This will be extremely dangerous but balanced since it can still be countered but also VERY deadly. 




Remember this is only my opinion so tell me what should be changed, next I'll be doing Octane  :).",1,1585414685,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqnvj4/legend_balance_part_1_bangalore/,apexlegends,2

And i feel pathfinder takes a lot of skill to use, with the grapples and when to zipline and also when you grapple in you have to hit your shots and kill them but i feel he does not do that at all and dies consistently. Also i dont think he uses his grapples right, for example i never see him take high ground during fights, he just grapples at the wall. Also i know that he is more of a casual players and only plays a couple hours a day and i am a competitive player where i play a lot more than him and i watch videos and tips constantly and i feel like i could get good with pathfinder. What should i do?",16,1585413127,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqneuy/want_to_play_pathfinder_but_friend_uses_him/,apexlegends,1

fqn2a0,BiggestForts,Which among the legends are in the most need of a change?,"I might get some hate for this, but hear me out.

These 3 legends are the ones that fit the category of good but not great. If I had put Revenant, Octane, or Mirage in here, they would've unanimously won the poll.

First of all, the pros and cons of these legends:

**Caustic**

*Pros*
- He's super scary to fight in close range. With the ability to place gas traps, he can literally fend off a pushing enemy without even shooting a bullet. 
- Rooms are basically nightmare fuel for enemy teams. If you see a Caustic in a building, they will bother not entering the vicinity, even if the Caustic's team is fighting another team.
- Gatekeeping is the worst thing that can happen in Apex. Caustic thrives in that. 
- He is the best in the end game circles. Whether it be spamming traps or throwing the nade on the floor, the enemies are fucked.
- If paired up with a legend with vast amounts of mobility, he can be the best tool to have for that team as he would be aided with mobilization while he aids in attack.

*Cons*
- Open areas are his kryptonite. Without a circumstance to get him out of the plain field, he's done for.
- His teammates are slowed by the gas, which wanes the candle that makes up a fully communicated squad.
- More turmoil arises when playing against a Caustic. Since he's immune to gas, you are going to need full cooperation with your team or good game sense.
- Third partying is pretty hard. You do have the mindset to push and the gas, but do you have the mindset to retreat if all fails? It depends.

**Bangalore**

*Pros*
- Long range combat is her specialty. With smoke, she can distort enemies' line of sight and take the shots.
- Her fast sprint passive is great. She can reestablish position just by running a few meters faster.
- Ol' Painless is good for crowd control. Every missile will force enemies to rethink their plans and will give you and your team time to rethink your plan as well.
- Paired up with Digital Threats, she can smoke an area and just contain a fight as if there was nothing.
- The best legend to pair with Bangalore is Bloodhound. With their scan and BOTH ultimate, and Bang's smoke and air strike, they make a great team.

*Cons*
- Although Bangalore's kit can provide for the team, it could also spell the team's downfall. Smoke distorts even your vision, air strike slows your team and damages you, the Bang.
- Ol' Painless is referred to in the community as a weaker Gibby ult. The pace of the strike is pretty slow and the enemies can find weak points on it to avoid damage.
- Close range fighting is messy with Bangalore, especially in smoke. Even with a Digital Threat, you have to actually keep track of your enemies outside of ADSing.

**Lifeline**

*Pros*
- She fits in with anyone. Wraith, Path, Crypto, you name it. 
- DOC is powerful in every good situation possible. Cowering in a building, covering up in a small circle with 4 squads with guns ablazing, even just the casual 1v1 gunfight.
- Care Package is considered one of the worst ultimates, but people underestimate it. It's good if you need cover. It's the equivalent of building in Apex. Also, the loot it gives is still relatively important for a squad.
- Revive shield is a beast. With impenetrability, you can use this to your advantage before, during, and after fights.
- Faster heal and revive helps a lot. With the royalty of not needing a Gold Shield, you don't have to scavenge for one. Although with every royalty comes a price. The Gold Backpack is to be prioritized by and to Lifeline. Faster revives and protection could save you a lot of time. With a Gold Backpack, you're to be the ultimate medic.

*Cons*
- She is one of three legends, the others being Wattson and Revenant, with an excuse to not have Low Profile, but has Low Profile. Wattson has no mobility (but is small), Revenant has a broken hitbox, and Lifeline has the same excuse as Wattson.
- DOC only lasts 2 seconds in the ring. She used to be considered the top legend because the DOC was not damaged until this nerf in S2 to contain balance in ranked.
- Care Package is RNG based. You might get what you want, but most of the time, it's a no.
- Revive shield is weak against steep areas. The revive animation keeps it upright at an angle which punctures some holes that can be shot through.
- Revive shield also gives away that there is a Lifeline on the team. Teams tend to contain a Lifeline because she can turn the tide of battle with her medic expertise. But they also know that she will have a hard time to escape due to the lack of mobility.
- Her mojo faded as Gibby started to steal her passives. Gibby was in no man's land during the first 8 months of Apex, but in S3, he got these few little tweaks that made him the mad man that he is today. Gibby is now considered a better Lifeline.

So, I want to know the fellow legends' opinions and is willing to answer any questions. If you want to start a debate, I'm down, just keep it civil.

fqjv1j,itsAshies,For a surveillance expert Crypto really does suck at his job,"Crypto needs a buff. He's a niche choice that can work in the right hands but overall he underperforms badly.

Let's look at his tactical. At this point in time his drone:

* notifies the enemies that they're spotted
* emits a lensflare visible from a mile away

Every character should have a drawback, but Respawn please, choose just one.

There's two ways to go about this, either remove the glow or remove the notification. I'd go with the latter because the drone is already easy enough to spot and if you can't see the flying green lens flare you probably shouldn't be alive. It would also be rewarding to players who can hide the drone well.

If either of this options is too big of a buff, then my proposal would be to add a zoom to his drone.

fqjopy,Doodler9000,If you're not going to increase the tick rate/command rate at the very least reduce the load by increasing available servers,"Increasing tick rate / command rate is a giant financial and technical challenge we all get it. Not happening in the foreseeable future.

That being said playing when everyone in your region is asleep provides a completely different experience than during peak hours. The guns feel tighter, whatever you input feels snappier. I believe the issue is there is considerably less packet loss because the servers have way less strain.

No one believes me, but it feels like an entirely different game in terms of how smooth everything is.

If you could just provide the same experience I get when everyones in bed all the time, it would vastly improve people's enjoyment of the game. There'd be less disconnects mid game, less stutter early game, less overall lag. 

If you're on PC next time try to remember how it feels when there's 20 squads in the lobby and when there's 7 or  less.

fqi066,GoTeamScotch,Is looting essential to the battle royale genre?,"Apex Legends is the first BR game I really got into, so forgive me if this is a dumb question. Is the looting mechanic found in most BR games, including Apex, essential to the genre?

When I picture a battle royale game, I think of a bunch of people dropping into a giant map and fighting with rings that constrict players until they all converge to fight until a winner is declared. I understand that looting is a means of pushing players to explore the map more, but surely it can't be the *only* way to entice players to move around?

When I first picked up Apex a month after it came out, I was hooked right away by it. The scale, the combat, the characters. But one thing that I have never cared for is the slot machine mechanic of looting. Sometimes you get lucky and are able to defend yourself, sometimes you get a bin full of knockdown shields.

I'm not suggesting to change the game. Of course not. But is there any interest for a limited time mode with class-based loadouts? Kind of like what they did for the holiday train event. Perhaps as rounds go on, your equipment is upgraded (round 1 = level 1 gear, round 2 = level 2, etc).",7,1585392976,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqi066/is_looting_essential_to_the_battle_royale_genre/,apexlegends,1

fqgrm4,Kialand,"I figured out how to fix the Sentinel, give it a place in the Meta, and add a Healspam/Gold Armor counter into the game, all in one go!","#Give the Sentinel‚Äôs Disruptor Rounds functionality the ability to actually **DISRUPT** Shields.

While Charged, shots fired by the Sentinel are guaranteed to break a target‚Äôs Body Armor. 

AKA 

If Player A has 125 Armor, they‚Äôll take a **minimum** of 125 damage, no matter where you hit the shot.

If Player B has a purple shield with 30 remaining HP, they‚Äôll take a **minimum** of 30 damage, no matter where you hit the shot.

For 10s, starting from the moment of impact, **any Shield Points destroyed by the Sentinel cannot be healed up.**

As such, if you bodyshot Player A, they won‚Äôt be able to heal their Armor at all. If you bodyshot Player B, they‚Äôll lose 30 max shields (and take 40 damage to Health, assuming they are not Low Profile/Reinforced, since the Sentinel‚Äôs base damage is 70.)

With this, Players have a weapon that can counter Gold Armor, excessively defensive playstyles and the Sentinel becomes an actually viable weapon.

Passive: When you get knocked, you stay invisible for 5 seconds and can move faster - giving more time for you to move when a player tries to thirst.

Tactical: When your decoy gets shot, the player who shot it has their location revealed for 5 seconds.

When you send out a decoy, you can switch places with it - wouldn't that be a slick bamboozle?

Ultimate: Once you activate your cloak, the decoys run off into different directions doing the same actions and interactions as your player, but enemies can still hear your footsteps.",2,1585382602,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqfyrf/my_mirage_buff_concept/,apexlegends,1

I've fallen in love with the game, and for the first time in a while I am seriously considering improving my  skills to be at a competitive level. 

I've only been playing for a week, and I still haven't played all of the current unlockable legends. That being said I've taking a liking to Bloodhound, and am enjoying his buffed Eye of the All Father, and special. 

I'm playing on console (PS4), and would appreciate any video recommendations or content creators. I would also enjoy any tips other Bloodhound mains can give me or any relevant help to improve my game. 

I've bought the season 4 pass yesterday, and am unaware of any necessary steps I should take to gain as much xp as possible. Not sure if xp matters, but I would still appreciate any tips in that department.

Lastly, in the games I've played this past week I've noticed that all of the random teammates I've been assigned never speak. I know that teamwork is crucial to winning in Apex, so I would it would be great to find teammates I can actually communicate with through mic.

I know mirage is in a bad spot but I personally love him with almost 2k kills 2k bamboozled and the 3k badge I have a small QOL for the Funny guy. 

Its is simple...here it goes.  

When shooting out a decoy have it display on the mini map it's position and trajectory and when it gets shot the symbols appears on the mini map along side your 1st person POV on screen. That's it... it seems very small and hell maybe it doesn't make a lick of difference but it could be a nice addition to a low tier character similar to when bloodhound got 5 seconds added to his ult when he gets a knock. It wasn't the grand buff we wanted but it was helpful and ended up being really awesome and useful and following that he got his scan increased 3 fold.

fqeuc9,PikaCrafter20,"Just had that ""I hate Gibby"" moment in ranked","So I didn't really get the gibby hate all that much at first. Like yeah, he's a super annoying legend to fight with fortified and all, but he has a gigantic hitbox. He was still the legend I hated fighting the most, but it never felt outright unfair until now.

So im doing really well. I have 4 kills, a fully kitted R-99 and a PK with a blue bolt. We see 2 teams fighting so we decide to insert ourselves. We clean up most of the people on both teams with a few people left. Eventually only one is left, Gibby. He just finished laying into Wraith with an R-301, leaving only me and my random Wattson up.

So I have the jump on him, and hit nearly every bullet in my R-99 mag, but he's still up. So I switch to my PK to finish him off. At this point, he's already turned around and started shooting me, but he's low so I should win no problem right? Nah. I shoot him with the PK and hit all the pellets, but the ADS shield doesn't care and absorbs them all, giving gibby enough time to knock me.

Thankfully Wattson comes along and finishes him off, but I just felt cheated after that. I should have won no problem against that Gibby but he took nearly a whole R-99 mag and a PK shot and lived.

fqenvw,MathisD,My thoughts on buffs for Revenant,"We can all agree that Revenant was REALLY overhyped and we can also all agree that we thought he was broken at launch. Sadly, he sucks and I would‚Äôve been a Revenant main if his kit wasn‚Äôt doodoo. I‚Äôve been thinking about what he could have as buffs and want to share it with you guys.

For his passive, I think it‚Äôs pretty good, however I would like to see the height limit to his climb higher, if not make it infinite, but that‚Äôs probably asking for too much.

For his tactical, the radius of the projectile can be the same, however instead of just 10 dmg once, make it so it does 10 or 5 dmg every half a second. This will make people panic when they are hit by it. The problem with this may be the dmg could be too high, or the radius may be too small for the dmg. Either way, I‚Äôm open to thoughts about it.

For his ultimate, definitely the worse thing about him, instead of putting down a totem, it should be something similar to Bloodhound, where he himself goes into shadow form, (We saw this in his reveal trailer). In his shadow form, he takes shield and health dmg, and the range he can go is infinite, since he isn‚Äôt limited by the range by the totem. When he dies, he respawns to the place he went in shadow form with 50 hp. With this, he can essentially push a team with the same health as they do, and not be at a disadvantage like with his totem.  Unlike Bloodhound, he won‚Äôt have any other advantageous buffs like speed increase or thermal vision of course.

With these changes, I think Revenant will go up in terms of viability. He may not be a good team player, but this is the best I can think of in terms of the kind of character he is. I am open to differing opinions on these changes.

fqefm6,TennesseeTimmy,Deja Loot was amazing and I miss him so freaking much,"I really liked deja loot mode. Every day since his departure, I've been thinking about him and even the mare thought of him makes my toes tingle and my stomach feel warm and fuzzy.  
It's amazing, it gave me an opportunity to re-discover the entire map and find out where the good stuff spawns etc.  
It added a lot more planning and tactics: If 2 teams landed on that purple armor, I could just quickly change my plan and go for a good gun nearby etc.  


The daily plane path and zone change meant that I got to go to new areas of the map, but not only did I get to just go to a different area every day, but every day I could master many different paths to take and try out different strategies for the same exact final zone.

At first I thought this mode would get repetitive, but the more I played it, the more I saw other players adapt certain strategies and land in certain areas, the more fun it was for me.  
Only around 5/10 games did I get contested when landing on a gold armor and sometimes there were teams all around that area, sometimes there were no teams in that half of the map.

The battle royale randomness stayed in the randomness of the players and different strategies they employed. But a new level of mastery was added, new exploration and it felt like the game was way more competitive.

3, can use his drone to pick up, guns ammo etc... only 1 thing at a time then bring it back to him.

4, can use his drone at recovery stations. to get team members back into the game.

5, infrared light. can see invisible people like when Mirage uses his Ult. doesn't work on wraith because her Tac into the void, literally puts her on a different plan.

6, can disable gas traps by simply going up to the weakness and holding (X)

7, can use jump pads, and wraith (portals her Ult) when in drone mode.

8, the Emp can be thrown by picking up the drone and tossing it like a grenade. it can also be pre-activated so you know a team is about to go into a building, put your drone in there prime it, then when the team gets close enough it will go off.

fqdrni,Tcm321,So I decided that I would attempt to improve the weapon meta or at least mix it up a little by introducing some new attachments and some buffs.,"Longbow: I feel like this weapon lost its spot in the meta with the removal of skullpiercer but didn't want to give it a straight damage buff and got this idea from seeing Bloodhound use it in the season 3 trailer. ""Tracker rounds"" would be a hop up that would allow you to track an opponent like bloodhound for 10 maybe 12 seconds by getting a head shot on them, but the trade off would be that it would use more ammo per round (maybe 2?). I think this would give the longbow some utility in high level play and would give it back a spot on the meta

RE-45 and P2020
Silencer. This would act as a level 1 barrel stabilizer (something the P2020 can't even use) and would reduce the noise made by shooting significantly (maybe by 60-70%).
This would help give these weapon some utility for flanking and such and would be able to be used in the P2020 along with hammerpoints

Sentinel
Electric rounds. These would replace disruptors and would act more like a combination of wattson's shields and a termite grenade. You would have to use 1 shield cell and would get 2 shots of these which would shock opponents for and deal 50 damage over 4 seconds and would slow them down by 15 percent. I feel that the sentinel isn't in a good place right now and disruptors don't do much because of their low benefit and high cost, these would allow the sentinel to one shot people with headshots if they have low shields and would be more useful for rushing than the current sentinel, since the round slows them down

Alternator.
Raise base damage by 4 and scale it up or down with headshots and legshot multipliers and reduce hipfire spread and vertical recoil while slightly increasing horizontal recoil. This would make it closer to the Titanfall 2 Alternator. This would make it's better competition for the other smgs for it's better tap fire at range and better hipfire, allowing to strafe faster",0,1585371727,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqdrni/so_i_decided_that_i_would_attempt_to_improve_the/,apexlegends,1

Make him send more than 1 at a time for his tactical.

1- octanes stim deals 15% of damage to health but super charges his swift mend so it heals 5 points a second and will heal sooner after taking damage
2- octane can still sprint when ADS‚Äôing when stimmed
3- the distance you travel on octanes jump pad changes if you are walking, running or sliding

I have around 900 crafting materials, 13000 legend tokens, and 4000 apex coins. I have every legend except wattson and caustic, both of which I intend to unlock later. Is it better to spend coins on apex packs, or is it better to save them for store exclusive items? Is it better to just unlock skins with crafting materials?

fqaoly,PopChief,Discussion about balance,"The game still needs some balancing tweaks but it is  in a good state. Compitetive apex is a discussion for another day. The only thing I see that needs some tweaks are a few guns. But champion balancing is a must and it needs to be balanced immediately. 

Spitfire- it's in a awkward position rn. I remember in season 1 it used to shred people but now it's not up to par. Maybe because the meta changed. But nevertheless it's dps is slow compared to the flatline which has higher damage per bullet and slower fire rate and slower strafe movement (this I understand as it is an LMG). Of course it's magazine size compensates that but it's not being picked up for a reason. 

Alternator- is leaning towards being good but nowhere being great. It has great dps but (like a the comment I just read) it's a substitute for r99 or r301. The recoil is one of the best in the game. The fire rate is fairly slow compared to any other Auto gun in the game. A buff maybe in it's magazine size or possible less horizontal recoil for a more mid-range sub machine gun as it feels more like it should be used that way. 

Scout- even though it used to be meta and godly it's not what it is anymore. The team feels like theyre confused what to do with it. It was great because the fire rate was high letting of shots for high damage. With an easy recoil pattern it shreds people mid range to far but this season it's lost. Being classified as an auto rifle but still having the strafe movement of a sniper rifle and having slower fire rate. Don't get me wrong it does work but it does not compare to the hemlock at all. It being faster with strafe and fire rate with relatively the same recoil pattern with it's versatility of being burst or single puts the scout to shame.  

As you may all know the champions hitboxes are absolutely terrible.

 Revenants hitbox is considerably one of the biggest within the game and by having a low profile passive brings his kit down. I'm assuming they're expectations of the champions was to be somewhat like wraith but sneaky however his hitbox doesn't qualify for the low profile passive. 

Octanes hitbox is some cheeks what else can I say.

Gibby needs a whole nerf. His kit is way too strong. 1v1 is nearly impossible and if that's what they want within a defensive champion then I'm all for it but the ability to heal faster within his dome and having that apply to squad, also faster res's makes no sense. Might as well change him to a support because we only have one in the game *cough lifeline. Including the fact that his ultimate is incredibly useful in different situations, his kit needs a nerf.",6,1585359333,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fqaoly/discussion_about_balance/,apexlegends,1

fq9yid,Billy_the_Beaut,Bloodhound‚Äôs real gender,"So I was watching a theory video and it talked about why Bloodhound hates pathfinder, and Bloodhound‚Äôs origins. The whole theory seemed very likely that this was his backstory. [Why Does Bloodhound Hate Pathfinder? My Theory for Bloodhound Backstory In Apex Legends](https://youtu.be/_hAPx1jwnM4)

We got a possible name for Bloodhound. Johann, pronounced Yo - Han. Now the name J√≤hann is Icelandic. Johann is Germanic. Johann is equivalent to John, and J√≤hannes(Icelandic) is equivalent to John. Not sure what J√≤hann is.

We already know that Bloodhound is Icelandic, and possibly other places near, like Germany.
Johann is a male name. And Non Binary isn‚Äôt even real, so if this theory is true, then Johann, now known as Bloodhound, was born with a dick. Maybe he goes as Non Binary because he wants his identity to be even more mysterious. But Non Binary isn‚Äôt a gender so here‚Äôs your possible answer:      MALE",17,1585356676,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq9yid/bloodhounds_real_gender/,apexlegends,1

fq9c6u,Zombtroll,List of current bugs in Apex (PLZ up-vote so Devs see),"Here's a list of every bug I've encountered in the current version of the game. If you have any bugs I've missed Plz comment them below.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Gold barrel stabilizer currently adds muzzle flash and smoke, making it the worst barrel stabilizer in the game.
2. Grenades sometimes are not equipable, needing you to go into inventory to select them.
3. All heals while holding the sentinel have a delay before using, making players need to change weapon to heal quickly, this is most notable with shield bats.
4. Mirage's decoys do not deploy while skydiving or deploy far behind mirage.
5. Dying while in beast of the hunt causes perma black and white screen.
6. Supply bin loot is difficult to pick up.
7. Sometimes leaving a match can take over 30 seconds to begin to connect to lobby.
8. Footstep audio is extremely inconsistent. Sometimes friendly footsteps are ear piercing other times enemies can be running right in front of you and you hear nothing.
9. It is much more difficult to land bullets with a Sentinel than any other sniper. (Possibly due to smaller bullet size.)
10. Some of the new lava areas on Worlds Edge do not allow player to fly back to land, constantly pushing them off map until they die.
11. Low profile characters take health damage from drone EMP while they have an evo shield equipped
12. Revenant has an unbelievably large hitbox yet is classed as low profile
13. Survey beacons are unbelievably ear piercing when used. Like I'm talking 4 times louder than a grenade blast.",442,1585354543,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq9c6u/list_of_current_bugs_in_apex_plz_upvote_so_devs/,apexlegends,1

fq8u6s,CoffeeInBowl27,AFK farming still exist,"Met a Bloodhound with level 100+ with 0 kills on Hong Kong server. That begs the question, how many games did this guy ruined to get to level 110+? 

I've found on this site, https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/347955/how-much-xp-is-required-to-gain-each-player-level-in-apex-legends , that it takes 1,571,700 xp to get to level 100. 
Since the afk farmer does not do anything else, the xp he get is from time survived alone which is 180 xp. Assuming he survived 20 mins of gameplay, he'll get 3600 xp total per match. 
So 1,571,700/3600 = 437 matches (rounded off). So, he ruined 437 matches/8740 mins/145.7 hrs/6.1 days worth of match, assuming he doesn't do anything else but afk farming.

Things that i did: 1. Updated drivers 2. Repaired apex 3. Reinstalled Apex 4. Lowered graphics to their lowest settings. (Also played with all settings) 5. Checked for another processes that may interfere, found nothing 6. Opened windows as ""Clean"" then ran apex. Same 7. Disabled Xbox Gamebar 8. Disabled Windows ""Game mode"" 9. Disabled sound effects. 10. Resetted several times. 11. Disabled Origin in game layout. 12. And more...

fq7oa4,SummerFrey,Mirage buff/rework Ideas,"Hello Reddit! 

A while ago I came up with some ideas for mirage reworks and/or buffs. In the following ability sets, I have tried to give reasons for why I would want certain abilities to enter the game. Feel free to comment on your opinion and criticize my ideas.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Mirage Rework Ideas #1: Variety**

**Tactical**

\-Add a wheel where mirage can select from 3 types of decoys. The original, the aggressor, and the coward.

\-The original is no different apart from increased health about  30-50.

\-The aggressor would follow enemy players within a certain radius and shoot in an enemy player‚Äôs direction not doing any damage.

\-The coward will run away from enemy players zig-zagging and sliding every few seconds until it reaches mirage. This would be good for setting up an ambush.

**Ultimate**

\-This ability acts like Mirage‚Äôs original ultimate. Except it spawns 2 Aggressive decoys which will shoot at enemies, 2 Cowardly decoys which will run away yelling, and 2 original decoys which will run around with no real goal.

**Passive**

\-When Mirage is downed, enemies will see a white outline and the player‚Äôs name like they would with their own teammates except this outline can‚Äôt be seen through walls, and if an enemy gets close enough they will still get the finisher prompt.

 I like this ability set because it would give mirage a bit more unpredictability. If a decoy is specifically moving to avoid you. Most players will assume this is a low health mirage and shoot at it. If the decoy is shooting at you again they become a lot harder to ignore. Really I just want to give mirage the advantage of more believable decoys. I got the idea from reading a comment by NizzyDeniro a few months back. I dont remember the post but I took a screenshot when I saw it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Mirage Rework Ideas #2: Now you see me, Now you don‚Äôt!**

**Tactical**

\-Mirages tactical works as normal he still sends out a decoy, except he goes invisible for a short period of time afterwards. Works the same as the current ultimates invisibility with a longer time on it. (4 or 5 seconds)

\-Mirage experiences a delay where he can't shoot or use items when he exits invisibility similar to wraiths ""Into the void"" ability. 

**Ultimate**

\-Just like the original ultimate Mirage goes invisible and spawns 6 decoys except now the decoys move and aim at nearby enemies, firing mag after non-existent mag at them.

\-One of the decoys will even follow an enemy's footsteps like the ones bloodhound can see in his ultimate.

\-The decoys appear translucent to Mirage and his teammates.

 **Passive**

\-When Mirage is reviving a teammate, it shows an illusion of Mirage looting a death box, (His own death-box) and the illusion disappears if it gets shot.

I wanted to think of an ability set that competes with one or two top tier legends at their job, not make them obsolete But make mirage more desirable with certain playstyles in mind. The benefits of this tactical ability over Wraiths into the void, for instance, would be seeing enemies and being harder to detect. The downside is you can still be hurt and your invisibility ends early if you take damage. The ultimate would also cause confusion Mirage could end his invisibility early and shoot from within the horde of decoys for some free cover.,Though more decoys may be needed for this.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Buffs ideas**

\-Allow Mirage to store 2 or 3 decoys at a time.

\-Increase his time invisible and add a meter or a timer showing how long Mirage has in his ultimate.

\-Make the decoys shoot illusory bullets and make gunshot sounds. If nothing else I want the decoys to provide some audio cover as well. I think the decoys would be a lot more believable if they made gunshot noises in some way.

\-Mirage's time invisible when downed is doubled, Mirage also moves 30% faster when downed.",2,1585349087,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq7oa4/mirage_buffrework_ideas/,apexlegends,1

Most of us can generally agree that legend tokens are next to worthless, with their only uses being: buying legends, weapon reskins, and rerolling daily challenges.  
Most players have absurd amounts of legend tokens. 

So I propose the idea of having a rental system for skins. Allowing players to rent weapon skins will not only give legend tokens a new use but It will also allow players to test out the skin and ensure they like it before purchasing it, maybe a system could be implemented where if a player completes challenges with the skin they rented within the rental period, they could be given a discount towards it's permanent purchase .",0,1585348302,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq7fh2/possibe_ideas_for_legend_tokens/,apexlegends,1

fq6xx5,Ender_PlayerOfGames,The Moderation Problem (Non-apex),"Moderation? I mean, how have you not seen or at least heard of how Roblox moderation is? Which im using it as an example, recently banned someone from there platform just because something ""Inappropriate"" was in there code, this code was supposed to be private to only the Dev team. But all the minecraft subreddits I've been to have had terrible moderation, such as [r/Minecraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/) &amp; [r/MinecraftMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftMemes/). I've only met a SINGLE mod, who actually nice and not as professional, and that was on [r/dyinglight](https://www.reddit.com/r/dyinglight/), which is 18+. So majority of mods are terrible people, one way or another, at least on THIS platform. This was just from personal experience with Moderation here on reddit

Also, the fact that the mods hear are deleting ""Joke posts"" are just stupid, even if they are jokes, someone anywhere could want that feature in game. but that does not mean they'd add it. The mods are just deleting others ideas, maybe Mojang &amp; Microsoft would add it if the mods didn't delete it. I looked through the suggested stuff that were added, and they were bizarre, and kinda funny. But they saw the light of day. Especially being a minecraft fan since as long as I can play it, its just sad that im being treated by ""respected"" members of the minecraft subbreddits is just sad. These terrible excuses of moderation MUST stop!!

Guess how many shards I have now? ZERO. No progress at all.

To solve this, when you finish an enemy make it work like a golden backpack, give the player 60% health and 50% of the shield if you are under those numbers so you atleast have a chance against third parties.",7,1585343484,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq5v5k/adding_healthshield_on_kill_will_give_reward_and/,apexlegends,1

fq5ud9,DJYumYum,"Banned from Apex, lost apex coins and crafting materials","Hi,

I logged into Apex Legends tonight and the first thing I noticed was that almost all of my Apex Coins and Crafting Materials were missing. I had 650 apex coins (now have 150) and I had around 500 crafting materials (now have 50).

I thought this was weird but didn't think too much of it and thought it must be a bug. I then tried to play a game and it tells me that I'm banned... I have no idea what is going on. I'm currently waiting for EA support on live chat but no idea how long I'll be waiting.

fq5efb,thisnotfor,Why crossplay isn't added,"Its not because respawn doesnt give a \*\*\*\* about their community or that the game is dead or any other non-sense, its this reason

Lots of time.

Some of you may be thinking so what if it takes them lots of time? Doesnt everything take lots of time? Well yes, but this takes LOTS of time, such as re-scripting the base of the game and you know how long it took to fix muzzle flash because it was connected to so many different lighting effects and even the map. Its not as easy as just pressing a button and now player will be put together on servers regardless of their platform. Then if you still don't agree with me, you may be thinking why don't they just focus on this aspect of the game and get it done with because the community wants it? Ironically, they are not doing that for the sake of the community, would you like to have to wait 6 months for a new legend or gun, or anything else you are interested in updating? Would you like a month or so of absolutely nothing other than skins and then get crossplay and then have to wait and extremely long time till the game gets and update that affects gameplay, And why on Earth is crossplay even so important? You can play with people on other platforms, woop dee do, now on console you can change a setting and have the ability to play with hackers! YAY! The only real benefit of crossplay is being able to play with friends on other platforms, while that is nice the majority of the playerbase do not have friends that they play with. I understand the majority of the reason why crossplay is coming up now is because Cod Warzone has it and Apex doesnt, but warzone was clearly scripted from the beinging to be able to support crossplay and apex wasnt",1,1585342131,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq5efb/why_crossplay_isnt_added/,apexlegends,1

I have Apex installed on a 2TB external drive. Other games which I would assume are more demanding run perfectly fine. This is the crash log I get almost every time (sometimes a smaller pop-up window opens but it closes before I get a chance to read what it says):

\---------------------------

Apex Crash - Out of Memory

\---------------------------

Apex crashed because it ran out of memory.

&amp;#x200B;

The most common causes of this are:

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ ""Texture Streaming Budget"" is too high in your video settings. Lowering this can help.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ All other programs plus Apex combine to use too much memory. Quitting other programs can help.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Your Windows page file is set too small. Increasing the page file size can help. (The page file lets Windows move less important memory to disk until it's needed again.)

&amp;#x200B;

TECHNICAL INFORMATION:

‚Ä¢ Apex was using 2.1 GB of physical memory.

‚Ä¢ Apex was using 5.5 GB of virtual memory.

‚Ä¢ Apex failed to allocate 4.0 MB of memory.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Your PC has 8.0 GB of memory physically installed.

‚Ä¢ Your PC has 128.0 TB of virtual memory (with the page file).

‚Ä¢ After Apex exited, your PC memory load is about 69%.

The post addresses the concept of a ‚ÄúSkill Creep‚Äù which in essence (and the short version) is when a positive feedback loop occurs as the good players just continue dominating the weak leaving only good and great players to play against each other which then causes the good players to just leave as well.

A SBMM system be incorporated so the weaker players stop getting their proverbial dick kicked in, especially in a new (returning technically) competitive PvP gamemode. A game like Destiny also wouldn‚Äôt have as many Smurf‚Äôs as a game like Apex (Because Destiny is both PvP and PvE, and it‚Äôs less centric to the PvP portion) so it implementing it would work even better.

Point here is that SBMM isn‚Äôt always a bad thing. The ironic thing is, I stopped playing Apex as much because my hidden ELO is so high that I‚Äôm constantly matching with the current Apex Predators on Xbox at the moment in pubs. So I get the flip side of the argument for SBMM, but maybe I should just look to play more efficiently and get better myself.

fq43x9,Crimur,Is there an active subreddit for Apex leaks?,"**Ignore the text below it's for automod**

The production of cheese predates recorded history and was most likely discovered by accident during the transport of fresh milk in the organs of ruminants such as sheep, goats, cows, and buffalo. In the millennia before refrigeration, cheese became a way to preserve milk. Although it is unknown where cheese production was first discovered, evidence of early cheesemaking is prevalent in the Middle East, Europe, and Central Asia.
Early Cheeses

It is thought that cheese was first discovered around 8000 BC around the time when sheep were first domesticated. Rennet, the enzyme used to make cheese, is naturally present in the stomachs of ruminants. The leak-proof stomachs and other bladder-like organs of animals were often put to use to store and transport milk and other liquids. Without refrigeration, warm summer heat in combination with residual rennet in the stomach lining would have naturally curdled the milk to produce the earliest forms of cheese.

These milk curds were strained, and salt was added for extra preservation, giving birth to what we now know as ""cheese."" Even with the addition of salt, warm climates meant that most cheeses were eaten fresh and made daily. Early Roman texts describe how ancient Romans enjoyed cheese often. They enjoyed a wide variety of cheeses, and cheese making was already considered an art form. They provided hard cheese for the Roman legions.

The word cheese comes from the Latin word caseus, the root of which is traced back to the proto-Indo-European root kwat, meaning to ferment or become sour.
European Cheeses

As cheesemaking spread to the cooler climates of Northern Europe, less salt was needed for preservation, which led to creamier, milder varieties of cheese. These cooler climates also saw the invention of aged, ripened, and blue cheeses. Many of the cheeses that we are familiar with today (cheddar, gouda, parmesan, camembert) were first produced in Europe during the Middle-Ages.
Modern Cheeses

Mass production of cheese didn't occur until 1815 in Switzerland when the first cheese factory was built. Soon after, scientists discovered how to mass-produce rennet and industrial cheese production spread like wildfire.

Pasteurization made soft cheeses safer, reducing the risk of spreading tuberculosis, salmonellosis, listeriosis, and brucellosis. Outbreaks still occur from raw milk cheeses, and pregnant women are warned not to eat soft-ripened cheeses and blue-veined cheeses.

With the American industrial food, a revolution came in the invention of processed cheese. Processed cheese combines natural cheese with milk, emulsifiers, stabilizers, flavoring, and coloring. This inexpensive cheese product melts easily and consistently and has become an American favorite. Production of processed cheese products skyrocketed during the World War II era. Since this time, Americans have consistently consumed more processed cheese than natural cheeses.
New Directions with Cheese

Handmade artisan cheese is making a comeback in a major way. Classic cheesemaking methods are being adopted by small farmers and creameries across the United States. Specialty cheese shops, which were once dominated by imported ‚Äãartisan cheese, are now filling up with locally made and handcrafted cheeses.",4,1585338305,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq43x9/is_there_an_active_subreddit_for_apex_leaks/,apexlegends,1

fq3kpq,steven11027,An overlooked setting that may lead to drastic improvement?,"As I‚Äôve been given a lot of downtime thanks to the quarantine, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research into the ergonomics of the game. I‚Äôm sure we all want to improve at this game in order to better enjoy ourselves, and so I‚Äôve taken it upon myself to see if any research would be of use to improvement and I‚Äôm currently perplexed. Particularly the response curves have me at a crossroads as there‚Äôs very little insight into the subject (any videos I could find on YouTube were too shallow and inept at showing an adept evaluation or understanding of such settings). I‚Äôm currently debating whether or not to switch from classic to linear response. Classic, unfortunately, has aim acceleration, and this is a useful tool for making adjustment in mid to long range battles, but at the cost of having consistent aim. I‚Äôve read in various other threads and articles that many pros pc players don‚Äôt use mouse acceleration because they believe one would never truly be able to establish a consistent aim due to the muscle memory always getting confused by how, in different scenarios, the crosshairs will move a different amount based on arbitrary factors. For example, whether you choose to move the mouse slow or quickly and with varying force. Accordingly, it only makes sense to apply the same principles to a controller. In all honesty, I‚Äôm a fine player with classic (I have the 20k badge, 4K badge, and am an apex predator), and have never given the settings before this much though. However, taking what others have said into account, I‚Äôve started to wonder whether or not I‚Äôd be an even better player if I started playing linear. Linear, to my knowledge, has raw stick input that is 1:1, which would allow for a far more consistent aim with little to no differences in change. However, although this is a great plus side, the one issue is that since the sensitivity is all around similar with little to no aim acceleration, keeping track of mid to long range targets would be an issue which would cause great concern. Accordingly, I‚Äôm at a crossroads which I feel would best be evaluated with the help of those with prior experience with response curves. Any insight or feedback into the response curves and which would be better for overall improvement by people who have tried out both response curves would be much appreciated.




         Also, I understand that everything is preference and muscle memory, and that I should try everything out first, but it would be best to find a consensus so that I don‚Äôt just ruin my current muscle memory on a setting I may not enjoy.",0,1585336727,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq3kpq/an_overlooked_setting_that_may_lead_to_drastic/,apexlegends,1

fq2qv3,justin_tennyson,The game is not as fun or cool as it used to be,"I hope that Respawn takes the time to read this because I am going to be reviewing a full year of grinding battle passes, sweating in ranked, and becoming a champion. In the past year this game has blown the heck up, undoubtedly: but, for those of the community who have seen the full journey, it may be becoming concerning that is the current state and headway of the game. I believe that when the first battle pass came out there was a tone that was set. It was something between midevil and dinosaurs which was a fun new take on the Titanfall universe that some found familiar and others found new and refreshing. The first battle pass offered a range of trackers and badges to collect that kept me and other players coming back daily. The season one trackers went far beyond its descendants and offered specific damage trackers for legends in a season. The badges were in themselves a challenge such as getting seven legends to top three one, five, twenty five, etc. times. These small things made the first battle pass seem in someway more content full whereas now that tap is running dry. Where we once got an abundance of somewhat neat skins for most weapons has been cut to just the chosen few for a season. When skydive emotes where implemented nearly all legends got one but as time has gone on it would seem that Respawn would rather tease you with a few then sell the best of the batch through an event rather than let the players who already payed for the battle pass have a chance at accessing all of the content that is to come over the course of a season. While the events themselves offer some interesting temporary gameplay they are hard to find interest in because you paywalled out of getting any of the event costumes. This kills the fun and the immersion but it is not the worst that multiplayer has to offer. There is much praise to be given to the even fighting grounds that are Apex legends. Everything is fair game in apex and you do not have to always worry about one or two bullets being the end of your life and game. Between shields, somewhat balanced grenades, and legend abilities the battlegrounds are fairly flexible in the level of equality that every player has in order to have a good match. However there is an unbelievable skill gap that game does nothing to give you a break from. Once you reach a certain point in skill there is no longer such a thing as just playing some public matches. You will be forced to play the games top players (Predators) at every turn whether you choose to play ranked or not.  This kills the casual player aspect of the game and does not make a player want to come back day to day or week to week just to get eaten alive by people far more skilled than them. Between the thinning battle passes and destruction of casual play I believe that unless things are done change the community will begin shrinking with every Royale that comes to follow it. The game in itself is amazing and fun but the vision has been lost. It was wildlands where anything could happen but now it is a sweaty game with hardly anything substantial to draw its players in with consistency.",4,1585334351,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq2qv3/the_game_is_not_as_fun_or_cool_as_it_used_to_be/,apexlegends,2

You would think that with quarantine, they would probably have more time to browse the sub, but instead, they are less active then usual.

I think that this is because they‚Äôre working on something big. However, now that they have to work remotely, they need to work a little harder to get it done, and they have to be very secretive. 

We already know that [Bloodhound‚Äôs Town Takeover is coming on the 31st](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/fd0957/bloodhound_town_takeover_tease_info_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), and while that‚Äôs a big project, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs everything they‚Äôre working on. They‚Äôve probably had that ready for a little bit and they‚Äôre just fine tuning and play testing it at this point.

I think they‚Äôre working on season 5, and that season 5 is going to be the biggest and most exciting season yet. Hopefully, this quarantine doesn‚Äôt cause any delays in that process.

fq112i,AsymmetricSquid,Revenant buff ideas,"*please note the humor tag before you reply. If you just read the titles and not the other words, you‚Äôre going to look like an idiot in the comments*

Revenant was the most hyped legend in the game, but so far, he has been incredibly underwhelming. He passive isn‚Äôt as good as it could, or should be, his tactical is too situational and difficult to hit with, and his ult is utterly useless. Below, I will list out and explain some buff ideas that I can up with to make Revenant a viable legend.


##1. Passive Buff:
Most people agree that Revenant‚Äôs passive is the best part of his kit, but even that needs some work. The fast crouch speed seems useful, but in actual games, it doesn‚Äôt help much. The climbing boost is nice, but you can only climb 2 stories with it, and by the time you get halfway up the wall, you‚Äôre moving so slowly that a tetraplegic could hit you. To fix this, only a small change is needed. 

Gibraltar is a very popular legend. You see multiple Gibraltars every match. Therefore, it logically follows that Revenants play with Gibraltars quite often. Therefore, if we give Gibraltar another passive that makes him and all of his teammates move at 2x speed at all times and gives them all infinite climb distance with no slowing down, Revenant will directly be buffed by this as well and his passive will be more useful.

##2. Tactical Buff:
Revenant‚Äôs tactical is cool, but it‚Äôs small range and small area of effect make it difficult to make use of. As with his passive, to fix this, only a small change needs to be made. Because Revenants often play with Gibraltars, if we give Gibraltar another passive, so that all enemies within 100m of Gibraltar are silenced, a Revenant with a Gibraltar for a teammate would always be able to fight as if he his his enemies with his tactical.

##3. Ultimate Buff:
Revenant‚Äôs ultimate is arguable the least useful of his abilities. It‚Äôs range and time limit are small, and it doesn‚Äôt give you any bonus health. To fix this, a slightly larger change is needed. Revenants often play with Gibraltars so of course, we need to give Gibraltar another passive. This passive should be that whenever a teammate punches Gibraltar, they gain super death protection, with infinite range and no time limit. If they are killed, they teleport back to Gibraltar with full health and Gibraltar automatically drops them a mini-dome. This would be balanced because Gibraltar couldn‚Äôt use it himself, so he wouldn‚Äôt be overpowered.

@RespawnDevs. Give the people what they want. We need these Revenant buffs. If you don‚Äôt give us these buffs, you clearly hate your players and are solely motivated by money and you are corrupt and bad at your jobs.

fq0ymt,JJ-Username,Mirage rework Idea,"So I have a rework idea for Mirage. I know Mirage has been underperforming pretty much since his release. And I think thats mainly because his clones don‚Äôt really fool anyone. So what if Mirage gave intel like Crypto or Bloodhound? My idea is the following:

Tactical: His tactical would be the same but with a little tweak to it. His clones would mark enemies that are in their line of sight. 

Ultimate: Instead of placing multiple clones at once he could send out a unlimited amount of clones for a very short period of time.

Passive: He can switch position with his clone for one time per clone. Does not work during the the ultimate.

Im not quite sure about his passive tho, it could be way to overpowered. But what do y‚Äôall think? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on that.",2,1585329165,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fq0ymt/mirage_rework_idea/,apexlegends,3

It's just a try and error game then whether I am able to get to the lobby screen or not however the problem isn't finished there.   
When I then reach the lobby screen I wait till my nametag moves from ""player"" to my actual ingame name which sometimes takes a few minutes. I have to wait because I can't oben my friends list or accept invites or do anything else what has to do with joining a lobby or starting a game.   
After that waiting I then want to join a lobby. I can accept invites and everything. While the game is actually taking me to the lobby for the guys in the lobby... the game leaves me lonely on my screen.   
I queue lonely and my mates can't queue because of me being in a game.

fpztjn,MikeLee0000,no fancy skill badge can be considered legit anymore on ps4,"this is a serious problem, lots of people are abusing bugs or smurfing to get badges that make you look good when you're not.

i'll start with ranked. alot of top 500 and master players admitted to abusing a very old glitch (NOT dashboarding) to prevent losing points, this existed since the elite 5 queue and series 1 ranked (the so called OG pred badge isn't 100% legit earned)




and now 20k 4000dmg bombs. this one is VERY easy to do with a glitch that puts you in beginner players lobby. an alternative is smurfing. some also got 20k during shadowfall before it got fixed.

fpzte8,kitsuao,Apex Theory," hello,  
I have an hypothesis regarding apex, based more on deduction  and assumption rather than on straight facts. it is hard also to put it  into word so sorry in advance if I didn't made it comprehensible enough.  
The  hypothesis is that the Syndicate is using the fruit of the research  made by Wraith and the people she worked for, on the possibility of  multiple dimension and the travel between them. it could explain why  there is diffrent version of each legends in each match. this fact being  an open secret or even not a secret at all could also explain why the  legends aren't surprised to see other version of themselves or their own  abilities being used against them. I would even go as far as thinking  that maybe the Syndicate became a multidimensional and unique company.  After they discovered that they were a lot of different dimension, they  should have also discovered that there is just as much different version  of the Syndicate; after contacting each others, they decided to fuse in  a single giant organization beyond dimensions.  
That could also explain why crypto was researching in the abandonned complex with the giant Wraith portal during Season 2.  
It's just an hypothesis and can be developped more but I'll keep it at that for now.",0,1585325822,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpzte8/apex_theory/,apexlegends,2

It would be nice to lower the time to retrieve your teammates banner to like 30 seconds.

fpxcvm,Akasakii,Another reminder that not having solos or duos is killing this game.,"I'm not here to read your opinions on why it shouldn't have it. They already did a solo LTM and it was magnificent. I loved it and so did everyone I talked to about it. 

It's already coded in. It literally CAN NOT hurt the game regardless of any developer's opinions or player opinions. It took Warzone 7 days to add permanent solo's. What in God's name are you waiting for? No one asked to take away teams. I know for a fact there has been enough money made to add servers if that's the problem. 

It's been too long now for excuses. The only viable explanation I see is laziness. I hope that's not the case but what possible reason could there be other than this. 

Please don't try to give me the ""legends would need re-balancing"" because that's not only silly but dumb.

fpwzen,aschkev,Mirage Buff Idea,"Our favorite bamboozler desperately needs a little love, and despite Respawn leaving our boy in the pits of the meta, I‚Äôve been thinking about how to make him better without completely changing what he does.

Passive: ‚ÄúNow you see me‚Äù
Mirage and his downed team mate go invisible while reviving. I saw a version of this on a post a while ago, but really liked the idea and thought it would really help improve his team utility. He also keeps his current passive, but is invisible for longer when down to escape better.

Tactical: ‚ÄúBamboozle‚Äù
Pretty much what he does now, but with multiple chargers and better AI for the holograms. Also, either throw out random legend holograms to confuse the enemy, or throw out mirage holograms, but give them like 20hp to make them seem more real. Haven‚Äôt decided which is better, I‚Äôll leave that to you.

Ultimate: ‚ÄúDisappearing Act‚Äù
Being invisible is the best thing about mirage. To take that away for the dummies big day ult would be a downgrade in my opinion. I do however like the idea of throwing out a bunch of holograms. So I propose the dummies big day ult, but when mirage activate it, he has a sort of flash bang type of effect thT temporarily messes with the enemies sound and vision, plus he goes invisible and sends out all the decoys. The decoys would also be invisible as long as mirage is and run in different directions. When mirage comes out of invisibility way, so do the dummies and they mirror mirages movements making it harder to find the real mirage. This helps the time by semi blinding the enemy team that witnesses the ult, and makes mirage a more trickster confusion type of character.

fpwwrg,jrparker42,"2 more bugs to discuss: 1 minor annoyance, and 1 game breaking.","The other day I posted about bugged and broken weeklys; well the ""land in x"" started working last night, so I got it completed.

But then...

The minor annoyance is on the ""get x headshots with weapon-type""; mine is 50 with LMGs. I have found that you have to space the headshots out a bit or they do not count. As in get into a fight with the spitfire and hit 2-or-3 headshots in a controlled burst; you only get credit for 1. I was able to see direct evidence last night in a chaotic fight: 3 l-star orange pips on caustic after I got killed, final random eventually dies to same caustic and I check on my weeklys; 1 added to the headshots. Happened a few times earlier last night that I saw the different color damage reg, but didn't die in a way that I could verify the hit-regs. 

I had also noticed this issue for the last few seasons; but most were 5-10 headshot dailies, so nbd. 

Now the fucking broken bug/issue: every so often I get k/d ""a little too fast""; but with enough time that I at least start to react, or expect that it was mostly headshots with a havoc. But as I was already in the habit of checking the death stats from the above issue, I checked on the rediculous ttk I received:

Scenario(on xbone, so not rediculous hacks): teamate is killed in sorting train station. I run in and keep mostly out of sight spotting the enemy running between the opening on the paired supply bins (outside wall) so I run up to teamates deathbox after making sure I am in the clear and also drop the dome shield over the deathbox. I grab the banner and start moving but spot the enemy rounding the corner.

This is where nothing makes sense: I, as gibby, ads my flatline and target the mirage. I get 1-2 shots out and go down, even though I started firing the second he came out of my dome. In the death report only his gun shows up, and with a reload (r-99), all body shots (so gunshield should have been in play). 

So for those playing at home: ttk of about 1/2 second, with reload, acting as if I didn't have purple body armor+gunshield, all body shots on fortified legend. Absolute nonsense. This was also not at peak play time (about midnight-ish EST) and I wasn't showing any slow-down or packet loss.",0,1585315624,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpwwrg/2_more_bugs_to_discuss_1_minor_annoyance_and_1/,apexlegends,1

Does absolutely nothing and dies

Legends, tell me stories about the most glonk teammates you've ever been paired up with in either pubs, ranked, LTM, etc.

I'll start:

So these were two matches. It was Split 1 in WE at Silver games. I get paired up with a BH and a Gibby who were decent.

Game 1, we went Skyhook and lost a fight we should've won, but I had no support.

Game 2, it was quiet the whole game, once again Skyhook. The stupid thing is we stayed there for the entire game. My teammates never bothered trying to look for enemies. And when we did, we were outclassed by high ground. We tried to outclass them, but our position was terrible.

In conclusion, these teammates were hot garbage at sticking together and just die in every fight they came across. Their confidence to push gunfire was as slim as a gummy worm. And it ruined my confidence. The good news is that I shook it off, played more ranked, and I got to Plat by the end of the split.",2,1585315589,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpwwgb/tell_me_stories_about_randoms_who_were_absolute/,apexlegends,1

fpwds9,LaughingPrince,Buff ideas,"Octane - Should either not have a health debuff when he stims because no other legend in all of apex legends has a debuff for using their ability, should in general do reloading and or grenade throwing, ads, and switching guns a tiny bit faster, or should have movement speeds that cant be beaten by other legends or matches with... maybe a speed between or at ahadowfall zombie level.

Revenant - should have unlimited climb speed, no it's not op and or at least not slow down in climb speed when climbing and be able to climb maybe double what he can now. He should also be able to crouch walk faster. His tactical should do damage over time if in it, maybe slow you down for 2 seconds and disable longer or give your ability to revenant for one use. His ult the most atrocious thing needs either way more time and range if as is, or needs to not make you a weak zombie from shadowfall when you use it. Or leave you at full health after use. Or a combination of these, because its awful and laughable. So many squads were wiped using the beacon and getting shredded st 100 health twice instantly due to weakness of beacon and its laughable range. Fuck revenant beacon and no it isnt situational worth a penny either. My opinion but deep down we all know it's TRUE! 

Mirage - I think he should go invisible whenever he uses a decoy even if it's the crappy invisibility we use to have or he should get way more decoys, kinda of like how Bangalore holds more then one smoke nades, or how octane can spam stim every other second. Also his decoys should always reflect current skin and be way more interactive like the dummy's party mode.

fpvfuy,Jhadi420,Octane buff,"Everyone knows this, octane needs a buff, but some people might say ""But octane is op he can regenerate and also he can also secure a kill fast""  yeah yeah he can do that, but only in the early game, in the late game at least everyone has a level 2 knockdown shield, and also he is not a team player, no pro team will choose octane over path or wraith, soo I have some buffs that might make octane rival path and wraith.

Passive : swift mend and grenade junkie

Every 1 second you are not hit you heal 1hp, and if you grenade yourself the damage will reduce to 85% but grenades from octane will do 2.5x the knockback, only to yourself. 

Tactical : adrenaline junkie 

You move 35% faster for 9 second but the cost of 15hp, but you leave green stuff behind, if your team touches it they will move 25% faster. 

Ultimate : launch pad

You throw down a launch pad that if your team goes through it they will be launched in the air with the stim ability that lasts 4 seconds if you reach the ground, but if octane goes through it with stim already on, he will be launched 1.5x the distance. 

Also fix his hitbox but add the low profile on him

Soo those were my octane buff thing, you can agree or disagree with these, but I think that a octane buff needs to be made, I love octane I have more than 600 kills with him and he is my main, he needs a buff to rival wraith and path in movement, and also mirage buff needs to go with octane's, respawn I love you guys and ill wait more.",0,1585309068,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpvfuy/octane_buff/,apexlegends,1

fpuxj8,iLG_DDTz,Mirage tactical rework idea,"Right now, everybody knows mirage is in a bad place. But after seeing the borderlands 3 trailer. I was thinking mirage could work like Zayn
Here's my interpretation on how he could be more useful

-He keeps his decoy the exact same, walking/running/sliding in a straight line to a set point or beyond, but like Zayn, if he presses the tactical activation button once more, he teleports to where his decoy is.


This makes him good for 2 reasons. Endgame, squads can leave the decoy untouched and risk getting flanked. Or have to reveal their spot. 
And start game, he can send a decoy running away just in case he gets screwed over with no weapon

Of course, his decoy wont shoot or drop grenades like zayns does. But i think this would be a game changer for him, what are your takes on it?",5,1585306497,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpuxj8/mirage_tactical_rework_idea/,apexlegends,1

fpuwyg,RushingRasputin,Spitfire is bottom tier.,"It has some of the worst TTK and lowest DPS at 154. It ADS strafes and shoots extremely slow at 30% speed like all LMGs. You're essentially standing still. Any AR, SMG, Wingman or Sniper will easily burst you down. Its got high recoil with a zigzag pattern like the Flatline, arguably even worse until you get a purple barrel stabilizer. Iron sights are some of the worst in the game. 

Only the RE-45 and Alternator have lower DPS than the Spitfire, but their TTK is very close to each other since the Spitfire overkills significantly at 100 HP and 200 HP. They also have much better iron sights, ADS strafes significantly faster and has much easier recoil making them better hot drop, early game weapons. 

Even the Mozambique and P2020 with their hammer points have a niche. The Spitfire's redeeming factor would be the mag size and hip fire, but the L-star just outclasses it in every single way. The Flatline, Hemlok and Prowler have all gotten buffs while the Spitfire is stuck with its Season 1 nerfs.

Its a fun gun but generally, people in Apex have gotten better than Season 0, Season 1 days.",5,1585306412,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpuwyg/spitfire_is_bottom_tier/,apexlegends,1

CROSSPLAY  and then solo/duo permanent,
Private match mode,
A replay , history of the previous games to track cheaters or find a randoms players that we want to reach,  
A redone of the friend system , 
The only big effort lol was the firing range which is a mode that made in a hurry like many others , badly made ,pretty useless and not convenient a private match mode like fortnite or cod or overwatch would be better .

fpub3j,Barvakrat,"Nice addition to the game - ""Win quips""","Hey everyone, I hope you legends have a good times playing the game while the quarantine ! 
First of all I want to thanks the Devs for the game and the time they put in it, its been a long time since I saw Devs that truly care about their multiplayer game and the community, so thanks for anything guys!! I deeply grateful for what you guys are doing! 
I had this the other day, lately I can play the game more than usual and I'm really enjoying the game, I play the game since day one and over the time I had amazing matches and amazing combats, either if it is 1 Vs 1 or 3 Vs 3 and I tight to my self why don't we can compliment if we win the fight.
My meaning is that we have so many kill quips that we can use during the game and sometime we have this great fights between equal players that makes our heart pump like crazy and if we win this fight we feel a great feeling of satisfaction and it will be nice if we can use a kill quip like ""that was a great fight"" or ""your squad did a great job"" or something like this, it can add to the overall feeling of the game and add more respect between players inside the game and here in the subreddit. 
The community is already great and I'm proud to be one of it and I really want to see the community and the game develop even more, I want to see the game in the next years. 
I thought of some examples for the win quips like - 
Octane - ""that was a harsh one, you guys almost didn't get me bored"" or something like that 
 Wattson - ""you guys really fought until it Hertz"" or ""papa would be proud of this fight, it was a really close one"" 
 Wraith - ""This fight could have end in many other ways, you guys fought well here and in many other dimensions""
 Gibby - ""Haha guys, you made me fight with all I got, great job Haha"" 
Bloodhound - ""The god blessed us with great opponents"" 
Pathfinder - ""I hope my creater saw  this, it was nerve werking, if I had a nerves system of course"" 
You get the point guys, the Devs have a great and creative team and I'm sure they can think over a great Win quips! Please let them see this, I really think it can add so much to the game and to all of us ! 
Meanwhile let us all log in and enjoy the battles, the game and the matches ! Let have a great times while this awful epidemic and let make the best of it legends! 
Great weekend for you all guys !

fpt4fv,Elvesareop,Wattson needs a nerf and s buff,"At this current point in time, Wattson is still an incredibly strong character, but there are things in her kit I feel that are weak and there are things in her kit I feel that are too strong. I am a Wattson main and have spent over 500 hours on her. My other 500 are spent on Pathfinder.


Let me first address what I feel needs to be buffed and rewoked.

Her fences are really weak all around, they're only good when you're boxed in with them, but they're easily destroyed and they do very little damage.

That's not really the issue I have with them through, they're bulky to use, there are times you can't place them down correctly, they also take forever to set up.


My proposition is that they rework her fences


Instead of having to click to put down each node, in addition to that I feel that there should be the option to click, hold, drag, and release to set up a fence. I feel this would be a lot smoother, and it would allow for Wattson to be a bit more comfortable to play.

The damage her fence outputs could increase just slightly, and I hope that they eventually slightly increase the health for her nodes. Her fences are not what make her strong, the nodes can be destroyed very quickly.

Ultimately it's her ultimate that makes her incredibly strong, and I propose putting a time limit on how long her ultimate can be deployed. This would prevent players from setting up in one location and camping. I propose a 1 minute and 30 second up time, I also think that her ultimate should recharge 5% faster with this.

These are just some ideas I'm throwing out, the only one of these I honestly would take over the other is the ability to set up her fences with a click hold drag and release, it would just make playing her so much easier, I can't tell you the amount of times I'm being chased and need to set up a fence to throw them of or even stop them.",2,1585296289,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpt4fv/wattson_needs_a_nerf_and_s_buff/,apexlegends,1

fpqu9l,NoshunEclipse,Return of Disruptor Rounds of Alternator and RE-45 (New Hop-up Idea),"Everybody remembers, if you played season 2, Disruptor Rounds right? Well my friend had an idea where the Alternator and the RE-45 has the same mechanic as the Sentinel, and using a shield battery, it could give what you currently have in your magazine Disruptor Ammo. Now to make this balanced, we need another Hop-up, called Chargable Disruptor.(Use a Shield Battery to give Disruptor Rounds effect on your current Magazine size. Does not stack with reloaded ammo)
                                                  /\
To interpret what I mean by |, it just simply means if you have a magazine of 20 in your Alternator, Charge it up with a Shield Battery, and reload, you will only have 20 bullets of Disruptor ammo instead of a full mag. This can be shown in a similar way of how much time you have before the effects of Disruptor disappears with the Sentinel.

I don't know if the Chargable Disruptor Rounds should be Level 4 Rarity (Gold), or Level 5 Rarity (Heirloom).

There's a poll too!","Crossplay probably isn't going to be happening anytime soon and if it does then it will probably be Xbox and Playstation players only. Because players like ""ReportsDontWork"" have been running amok on the PC servers since launch. I don't know about PC's report feature but console players' report features are definitely going to be useless if we get put in lobbies with PC cheaters. Our reports just go straight to Microsoft and Sony and I don't think they'll be able to do anything about PC players who cheated from a different platform and launcher that they have no control over.

**- - -**

I would love for Solos to be added and I know plenty of others would too but considering Respawn's been silent about it since September, hasn't brought it back, and this community's obsession with being arrogantly against it cause ""taem gaem"": I don't think its going to happen :(

**- - -**

Duos on the other hand might actually become permanent considering Respawn keeps bringing it back and the Downvoting Daniels being okay with it cause they're in a ""taem"" still so look forward to that I guess?

**- - -**

*This is all coming from a Week 1 ""delusional"" solo queuer with ""deteriorating mental health"" who had to constantly be reminded that its a ""taem gaem"" and that Solos would just be nothing but Pathfinders and Wraiths so take this all with a massive grain of salt. Yeah cause God forbid Respawn takes 10 seconds to put a cap on how many players play a certain legend each game for Solos. Yeah cause God forbid Respawn takes 30 seconds to give certain legends ""Solo Versions"" of their abilities to be more useful in Solos. Then again I've been told by the same people that both those ideas are StUpId and that people should be allowed to choose who they want and that Respawn shouldn't waste their time making ""Solo Versions"" of abilities and that it would just confuse people by having some abilities have 2 descriptions now despite one of them clearly being labeled ""Solos Only.""*

fpp67r,AzraelDreamur,Legend Concept: Riot,"Role: Support 
Birthplace: Japan 

Ultimate Ability: Inspire
Riot puts down his packpack and puts a small radio beacon out, and gives out a war cry, empowering all allies to have a small damage boost in its radius. The Beacon can be shot down to cancel it's effects. Effect is limited time.  Riot is a support, but a much more aggressive one. 

Tactical: Spike Tarp
Riot tosses a mesh covered in spikes onto the ground. Moving though the mess causes damage over time and slightly slows movement. The mesh can be shot and destroyed. The idea is putting this down in front of a choke you know the enemy would have to push through, giving you time to revive a teammate. 

Passive: Patch up
Riot has better mobility while healing, and can use shield cells and health packs on teammates, letting him patch them up at a faster rate. His own healing rate is the same. 
Gives you incentive to use a medkit on a teammate that is looting a box and doesn't notice how low their health is. 

Not really edgy or anything, just naturally over protective and only wants to see his entire squad survive. Clumsy and anxious dude to outcast his overly nervous self.

fpp15q,SourceIsMyAss,"The ""value"" of badges","If you think about it, the value of a badge changes slightly over time, for example the fight or fright event and the addition of the charge rifle devalued the 20K and damage badges respectively (albeit only by a bit). 

The biggest thing imo that changed the ""value"" of badges is SBMM. I started out as a ~0.33KD player and improved to 1.72KD as of right now. I have a couple medium tier badges (three 2.5k badges, two double duties, two triple triples), and ALL of them were obtained on my journey up to my current KD, many of them were obtained after going on a tilt streak with low dmg/kills and then doing decent in lobby that was probably filled with potatoes. 

I've admittedly been hardstuck at my current KD for quite a while now, probably from about mid season 3 to now. Sometimes I see players with triple/quadruple dagger badges (assassin badge) and only a 2k/2.5k badge paired with them, I guess they're in the  same boat as me.

Duos on the other hand might actually become permanent considering Respawn keeps bringing it back and the Downvoting Daniels being okay with it cause they're in a ""taem"" still so look forward to that I guess?

**- - -**

*This is all coming from a Week 1 ""delusional"" solo queuer with ""deteriorating mental health"" who had to constantly be reminded that its a ""taem gaem"" and that Solos would just be nothing but Pathfinders and Wraiths so take this all with a massive grain of salt. Yeah cause God forbid Respawn takes 10 seconds to put a cap on how many players play a certain legend each game for Solos. Yeah cause God forbid Respawn takes 30 seconds to give certain legends ""Solo Versions"" of their abilities to be more useful in Solos. Then again I've been told by the same people that both those ideas are StUpId and that people should be allowed to choose who they want and that Respawn shouldn't waste their time making ""Solo Versions"" of abilities and that it would just confuse people by having some abilities have 2 descriptions now despite one of them clearly being labeled ""Solos Only.""*

fpohc4,PsychosisKing,A Perspective of Apex Legends - Player Conflict &amp; Etiquette,"There's a very important question that every Apex Legends player needs to answer:

**When you queue up, how do you want to play Apex Legends?**

a) **I want to play for the action.** If I'm not constantly fighting or I spent substantial amounts of time idly looting, the game becomes stale. A win doesn't feel earned without an improving kill count and damage value. 

b)  **I play to win with caution &amp; prep; beyond that by any means necessary.** Hiding, looting and surviving is reasonable, if not ideal. Let the aggressive teams pile up. At the end, their loot is what will be used to kill the last few teams. A win is a win and that is more than satisfying enough for me.

c) **I play for my squad and for the fun of just playing the game.** Being good or bad is only as important to me as it is to the people I'm with. Messing around, causing shenanigans and potentially making content that may be oddly outside of the competitive nature of the game is probably what I'd prefer to be doing, but I understand the game enough to know that I should probably be trying to win with my team.

You may find that you are a combination of these types to some capacity. I won't ever suggest that people are constant, because there are always variables. Your answer here is just leading to the point I'm trying to make: *none of the options are necessarily correct or incorrect*. They're all valid ways of playing the game. If you disagree, then allow me to explain why this is the case. Very simply, *Respawn lets you do all of these things*; the game is designed to allow this conflict of interest. Mechanically, there is no threshold you must past to win a match other than being the last squad standing. You may argue all you want, or decide to ignore that fact and continue to be toxic. Just know that even in apathy, you're part of the problem.

So how do we deal with these conflicts of interest, then? Well, let me first tell you that I'm frustrated too. Without crossplay, I rarely do anything but solo queue. I've been the one to solo drop and the person who complains about a squad member solo dropping too. That being said, I'd like to address some of the ways players make the game harder than it needs to be. Perhaps in doing so, those of you who do these things can catch yourselves or have the opportunity to offer rebuttals or ideas I hadn't considered, thus helping myself and those who agree to be better squad members.

1)  **You pass jumpmaster more than once** \- This might make or break your attitude towards your team and the match you're in. There's a one in three chance that you will be jumpmaster. It will happen often. I personally hate the responsibility and those who share that sentiment or are too busy at the moments notice to fulfill it will probably pass it off. *If it is passed back to you, take it.* Your teammates are trying to see how you play. From personal experience, you want those people in your squad because they will usually work with you. If not, they have basically waived their right to complain about where you choose to land anyways. 

2) Y**ou always drop into hot zones or drop immediately** \- So you consider yourself the A-type I mentioned above or you just need practice getting kills. I've heard this argument a few times over and I get it, but consider the following: you see 3+ teams, you and your teammates have varying levels of latency, and the legends you pick have different kits that work in different scenarios. As good as you want to get at the game, does it really make you a better player to force yourself into a situation where you're left with your only your melee and no shields against someone or an entire squad shooting at you? What happens when that purple shield and peacekeeper you're running towards are taken by someone with a legend that's simply faster than yours and has a better connection? Now imagine these problems apply to your teammates. You get annoyed that they couldn't handle themselves, although this could all be attributed to factors that may have well been out of their control. The alternative is that you run away to find loot anyways. 

I understand that this is a more complex problem than it seems with twenty teams, a limited amount of named locations on either map and a loot. *No, nothing is wrong with wanting to get better at the game and taking a risk at high tier loot. Yes, you can mitigate this problem by landing in an adjacent location. Just don't do it every time.* A common bronze level behavior is people who want to be type A players dropping into hot zones while lacking the proficiency to actually play that way. It's too easy to jump into a new match, so it becomes a repeated process of drop and death within the first minute until they are good enough to survive or fortunate enough to have someone carry them through the mosh pit. Exercise some patience and explore the map. You'd be surprised at the areas that go untouched.

3) **You value loot above your teammates** \- *Gorilla brain says ""pretty pretty shiny shiny, precious is mine""*. Be smarter and don't be greedy. Break off from the jumpmaster and go to a different building or container. If you're in the same building, go to a different floor. Just don't sweat next to them picking up things in the pile they are clearly trying to accommodate into their inventory. It's Apex, there's plenty. If its not somewhere in the environment, you'll find it in a death box. Speaking of which, there are three very important situations people need to be better about:

3.1) *If your teammate has been downed and you have the opportunity, pick them up before you loot further.* Particularly, respect your teammate's kill(s). Even if you're so compelled to look inside the deathbox, leave them the most valuable items for them to look at first. Ping them. There is an exception to this rule, and its if you need to refill/replace your shields, health, and ammo due to enemies being nearby.

3.2)  *If you were not the one to shoot down the cargo bot or loot tick, do not crowd around and take from the spoils*. This applies to the vaults as well.

3.3) . : : \*\*\*If you take NOTHING else from this list, remember this\*\*\* : : . - *SHARE WITH YOUR TEAMMATES. Treat them, offer them the purples &amp; golds that benefit their chosen legend.* I can personally attest to this being the fastest way to get your team on your side. They will fight for you for your generosity if they can. I do this for squadmates who are rude to me over the mic. They will shut up. If I have a blue shield as Caustic and I understand that my teammate is playing an offensive legend with Low Profile, I will gladly ping the purple for them, or give them the level 4 Barrel Stabilizer for the R-99 they're carrying. Give them the supplies you can spare when they need them. Be kind, guys. You don't have to be nice and talk to them as if you like them; that's petty. You prove to them you're willing to make the sacrifices to win and show confidence in your own ability as a player. They will save your life as backup or meatshields. Even if they fail you, they will usually at least try to return that kindness.

4) **You take your teammates' assistance for granted or abandon them** \- No, you don't have to be kind to your teammates the same way they may be. I don't expect a gold for a gold; this isn't a trade. However, if I pick you up in the heat of a fight and make an attempt to retaliate to give you cover to heal, help me. If I'm downed, and you have filled your health, but not your shields, or vice versa, come help me. I made it a team effort by helping you. It doesn't help that I've downed two of the three people in the squad and you're still running away. This is why people leave you to die. Type-A players, I'm particularly looking at you. It is, again, a team-oriented game and you've proven that you need me by getting downed. You can run away after getting your teammate back up. It'll increase your chances.

5) **You don't ping or you do so haphazardly** \- The ping system is one of the best and most differentiating aspects about Apex Legends. Why aren't you using it? It solves so many of the conflicts of interest (or at least mitigates them) by allowing you to tell your teammates what you're going to do or recommending what you should do as a team. 

5.1) If you're dropping solo or breaking off from the team, *ping*.

5.2) If you're down and expect your squad to help you before death, but there are enemies around, *ping them*. Once or twice every few seconds to keep track of where they are is fine. Spam if they are performing a finisher on you.

5.3) If an enemy/squad is extremely close, rapid ping for 2 seconds.

5.4)  If the circle is closing in and your squad seems clueless, ping where to go.

5.5) If you're running away from a fight, *P I N G* (Your teammates might have been there to help you, but if there are enemies nearby, they can't always be looking where you're going).

5.6) You're either of the trapping characters and you want to bunker down, ping the building/location.

Use the mechanics. Even if your not the best as aiming or the most aware of how to use the characters, you can strategize. Your teammates can help you get the kills you need to build your stats if you just tell them who you're trying to attack or who you're running away from. It's okay if they don't listen to you, you gave them the opportunity to get the message. And it lingers for a while.

I was playing Apex Legends after the ranked split and I had teammates who were completely negligent to most of these behaviors. Three hours of play and I got the furthest on my own after a game during which teammates gave up and disconnected despite my attempt to save them. I actually won with a squad that actually considered all of these things. That doesn't mean it will work every time, but at least I can look back at my teammates and the match with positivity. 

There will always be players who won't really consider these observations. ""I play video games for my personal enjoyment, if people are going to ruin that for me when I solo queue, I don't need to work with them, so I won't."" To them, I offer this warning: despite the freedoms offered to you, be aware of the fact that any compliments or criticisms anyone offers combined with the vision of the developers might restrict those freedoms. You could very well get what you wish for, but only at a cost. At the same time, you are helpful to neither the cohesion nor the health of the player base. As clich√© as it is, the golden rule is to act and react to others as you'd like them to do so with you. I'm not saying you won't get mad or have bouts of toxicity, but just to try to consider that as a video game, this is something people participate in to enhance their lives in some way, whatever level of stability that their circumstances have allowed.

In terms of what Respawn can do about this, there are two things I think the game needs that will positively affect player behavior:

1) Crossplay, as soon as possible. You'll get the numbers to at least rotate solos and duos more often into the mix.

2) Structure and transparency. Help players understand what the game is (or at least what its trying to be) from the developers standpoint and offer tutorials or game modes (beyond firing range) that properly set the expectation.

Feedback from any and all is appreciated. For those who are interested, I made a threat recently about the changes I'd make to game to improve its overall quality. Check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fp10jv/a_perspective_on_apex_legends_changes_and_ideas/).

fpo2at,DeathsKryptonite,Please practice better cooperation and communication if you choose to play Ranked,"This is the first time I'm playing at the start of a ranked reset and the amount of people that run off and die or jump into fights without any concern for their surroundings is astounding. I understand that majority of the enemy teams are triple stacks, so they can communicate better, but that is no reason for the level of support I've seen in the past 2 days. 

When playing Ranked PLEASE keep these things in mind (feel free to add more in the comments):

-Ping an enemy team BEFORE you start shooting. 

-Request meds if you are out (I, and most people, carry more than they might need)

-DON'T wander off by yourself, even if you think you can take a whole team by yourself.

-SHARE the loot (especially if you didn't get the kill... I'm looking at u Octane)

-GIVE better gear to whoever needs it more (ie. Giving Wraith a gold helmet when playing with a Mirage and Bangalore)

-Land NEAR me NOT with me. Break off (this one might just be me lol)

-REVIVE your teammates when you have a chance. DON'T chase after kills, especially when you know only one person on the enemy team is knocked.
REVIVE (part 2) your teammates BEFORE looting all the boxes. Chances are another team is on their way.

-Reviving your teammates is important but don't be a hero. If you are almost dead and/or in a bad position sometimes the best option is to continue without them (I don't mean abandoning them but if they are outside the ring and you have little meds, the best option is to play for placement rather than risking everyone dying.

-Randomly shooting?? Like... don't. Not sure why this has been an issue recently.

-if you are at Containment, please for the love of god DO NOT STAND NEXT TO THE FLYERS. Everyone can hear us from 300+ meters away.

-PING where you are going. Your teammates might know more info about where you marked (like that they saw a Dia/AP team land there and you might wanna keep an eye out or steer clear)

-HIGH GROUND is very important. DO NOT engage with someone who has high ground on you. Look for a way up or disengage.

-DO NOT GIVE UP HIGH GROUND because you want to chase a kill. The person is most likely leading you back to their team. If you do chase, make sure your team is ready to follow you ( even if it ends up being a solo player. Better safe than sorry)

- HELP out your team if they request something. Mutual respect leads to a greater willingness to work together. Ping an attachment if they asked for it.

-AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER... ALWAYS say thank you to your teammates!!

Tl;dr-- Work with your team and don't be the guy that constantly needs to be saved bc of his own actions.",10,1585272573,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpo2at/please_practice_better_cooperation_and/,apexlegends,1

fpntgr,DoubleOnegative,Crypto bugfix and QOL Changes,"Hi guys, as a PRED/Masters crypto player, I would like to provide some feedback on Bugfix and QOL changes. I think Crypto is in a great spot right now, but these fix/changes would fix some of the annoying things that occur while playing him.

1. BUG: No assist for scans. 
   * Getting assist for scans is super unreliable ever since the fix for enemy kill assist. I'm 90% sure that when they fixed enemy kill assist, they made it so if an enemy does any damage to the person, even if your teammate kills them, you don't get an assist.
2. QOL: Drone animation doesn't cancel if drone entry is cancelled.  
   * If you get knocked out of your drone during the entry animation, the animation continues to play, but instead of entering your drone you end up back in your characters POV. This can be super disorientating because there's no immediate indication that you aren't in your drone and can cause you to accidentally walk your character out of cover/off ledges etc. 
   * This can also cause animation looping. Basically, because there is no indication that your drone entry has been canceled, if you hit Q again during the entry animation to quickly exit the drone, you end up playing the entry animation again, and you easily get stuck in a loop of trying to exit the drone, only for it to play the entry animation over and over.
3. QOL: Drone cancel on taking damage.
    * for 99% of the players, this is a good thing. However, I think there should be an option for players to disable this for more control. For top-level players you typically aren't going to be taking damage without realizing it, and here are situations where you know you are dead but want to get your drone out for a clutch EMP for your team, only to have it canceled because you took a shot. 
    * This is also one of the main causes of the animation looping. You enter drone and notice you are getting pushed, so try and quickly press Q to exit drone. But because you took a little bit of damage, the drone entry has been canceled (but the animation keeps playing), so your Q causes you to enter the entry animation again (once the previous one completes). This is super annoying and has caused me to die many times. Having an option to disable the auto-exit would give you much more control over whats happening.
4. QOL: Drone entry cancel on climb (sometimes, read #5).
    * If your character attaches to a wall during the drone entry animation, the entry gets cancelled. This is consistent with other characters in the game (such as wraith Q) but I dont think it should be a thing. Also goes back to the animation not cancelling even if entry is canceled. 
5. BUG: Mounting a wall (Ie, holding on to a ledge) allows you to enter drone, but locks the drones camera to the same 45deg camera rotation you're character has while peering over the wall.
   *  If you end up mounting a wall while entering drone, your drone entry isn't canceled, but you get stuck into the rotation lock as if you were still in your characters POV.

fpn2eh,MidniteWolfur,A possible buff for mirage.,"I use to main mirage before and after his actual invisibility buff, but he is still very lack luster. I have a balancing idea that would improve him enough to be viable again without making him top tier. My proposal would to make him a true bamboozler. Buff his passive encore ability with 2 abilities. 

1, make it look like his ult, 8 decoys and some run, when he is downed.

2, whenever a person knocks someone you get that little audio que and a notification pops up in the middle of the screen, make it so if a player downs a mirage, they dont get that notification or audio que.

This will make it look like he may of used his ult last second in a fight. But also it may be easy to know if you knocked him if you're good at counting damage and or skill, but it still gives you a chance to slither away and the enemy is more likely bamboozled. This would make his passive more viable.

fpmuwa,Sprainedmantis,Ranked bug making it unplayable.,"Long post, to give specifics.

I know the split is intentional. What everyone deals with is to play a game with there old rank and then it resets them down a tier and a half. This usually works just fine. I was diamond 1 pre-split derank, then played a ""diamond"" game and got reset to plat 3/4. But my buddy in the same game was diamond 2 pre-split derank and would have gotten placed at bottom plat 4. Heres the kicker, because the game thinks hes diamond 2, we get put in the super sweat new split diamond lobbies. but because he is actually plat 4 he cant technically lose any points. He has tried playing a solo game after it didnt derank him and no dice there either. All i want is to level up in rank with my buddy, but the this stupid bug that was here last season as well is making it super difficult. Comments like ""just get gUd ""are not what I am looking for.

fpmoji,AsymmetricSquid,Revenant buff ideas,"*please note the humor tag before you reply. If you just read the titles and not the other words, you‚Äôre going to look like an idiot in the comments*

Revenant was the most hyped legend in the game, but so far, he has been incredibly underwhelming. He passive isn‚Äôt as good as it could, or should be, his tactical is too situational and difficult to hit with, and his ult is utterly useless. Below, I will list out and explain some buff ideas that I can up with to make Revenant a viable legend.


##1. Passive Buff:
Most people agree that Revenant‚Äôs passive is the best part of his kit, but even that needs some work. The fast crouch speed seems useful, but in actual games, it doesn‚Äôt help much. The climbing boost is nice, but you can only climb 2 stories with it, and by the time you get halfway up the wall, you‚Äôre moving so slowly that a tetraplegic could hit you. To fix this, only a small change is needed. 

Gibraltar is a very popular legend. You see multiple Gibraltars every match. Therefore, it logically follows that Revenants play with Gibraltars quite often. Therefore, if we give Gibraltar another passive that makes him and all of his teammates move at 2x speed at all times and gives them all infinite climb distance with no slowing down, Revenant will directly be buffed by this as well and his passive will be more useful.

##1. Tactical Buff:
Revenant‚Äôs tactical is cool, but it‚Äôs small range and small area of effect make it difficult to make use of. As with his passive, to fix this, only a small change needs to be made. Because Revenants often play with Gibraltars, if we give Gibraltar another passive, so that all enemies within 100m of Gibraltar are silenced, a Revenant with a Gibraltar for a teammate would always be able to fight as if he his his enemies with his tactical.

##1. Ultimate Buff:
Revenant‚Äôs ultimate is arguable the least useful of his abilities. It‚Äôs range and time limit are small, and it doesn‚Äôt give you any bonus health. To fix this, a slightly larger change is needed. Revenants often play with Gibraltars so of course, we need to give Gibraltar another passive. This passive should be that whenever a teammate punches Gibraltar, they gain super death protection, with infinite range and no time limit. If they are killed, they teleport back to Gibraltar with full health and Gibraltar automatically drops them a mini-dome. This would be balanced because Gibraltar couldn‚Äôt use it himself, so he wouldn‚Äôt be overpowered.

@RespawnDevs. Give the people what they want. We need these Revenant buffs. If you don‚Äôt give us these buffs, you clearly hate your players and are solely motivated by money and you are corrupt and bad at your jobs.

fpl34u,oSHAINo,Kings Canyon ranked,"Hi guys.

So i'm pretty new at Apex.
I've maybe played 30 games on Kings Canyon, while i've played hundreds and hundreds on worlds edge.
Ranked games is something i really used to enjoy, but to my shock, you can only play ranked on Kings Canyon now.

And since i have zero map awareness, don't know where the loot is, where enemy's normally will approach from etc, i can't really enjoy the ranked games anymore.

I do understand that Apex want to give a little extra to the old playerbase, but I feel like the new players get left behind a little.

In my ideal world, you should either be able to play Kings Canyon in casuals (so you can practice without ranked) or simple just be able to choose which map you want to play ranked in.

For now, ranked is ruined for me, which basically means the game is ruined for me.

What do you guys think about this?

Added to this is it‚Äôs a guarantee every squad will have one, which is fine. But when it‚Äôs late game and everyone I run into has an R-99, I can‚Äôt help but feel miffed for trying to find other meta‚Äôs beside ‚Äúsmg go fast‚Äù.

fpki0v,oSHAINo,Old map in ranked,"I'm sure this topic has been brought up before, but I could'nt find any thread on the first pages.

Well, i'm a New Apex player and only got to play 30 matches on the old map, while i've played hundreds and hundreds on the new. 

I used to really enjoy the ranked aspect of the game, but to my shock you can only play ranked on the old map, where i have no idea where the loot is, the points where enemys most oftenly will approach from etc.

I do like that Apex think about the old playerbase and give them a little extra.
On the other hand, i feel like it's ruining the game for the newer players like myself.
If only you could play the old map in casual, so you had the chance to get used to it before entering ranked games, i would be fine with it. But thats unfortunately not the case. 

What do you guys think?

In my ideal world, you could choose whether you wanted to play ranked on the old map, or you want to play ranked on the new map.
For now, the game is ruined for me and I will not return to ranked before the new map is an option.",0,1585259544,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpki0v/old_map_in_ranked/,apexlegends,1
fpkgjr,Maultex,Question about SBMM and player count,"So for context I play on Xbox, am level 205 with a K/D of 1.5 and average damage per game somewhere in the 400 range.  I‚Äôve been playing for a year and have reached platinum as a solo in every season so far before quitting ranked because playing without premades is irritating.  
Around November of last year (about the time I stepped up my Apex game) I started noticing that I would have an average of ten or so players in my lobby who were displaying their diamond or predator dive trail.  
When season four hit I noticed that number jump up to around 15 or more players who were displaying dive trails.  Now I personally do not view myself as a great player and I assume I am slightly above average at best.  However every firefight I get into I need to bring my A or at least my B+ game.  I only play around 6-8 hours a week and don‚Äôt have nearly the level of experience or total number of games most of the other players in my lobby do.  

So my question is this: am I better than I think I am and therefore forced to compete with the top 5% of Xbox apexers?

Or do Diamonds and Preds not live up to the hype of being the best?  Are they simply folks with average player skill and too much time on their hands?

Or, has SBMM been lessened so that I now play with a wider variety of players?  (I doubt it because firefights are usually tough and when I play with my silver ranked buddies they always talk about how they only see diamonds and preds when they play with me)

Or finally, has the player base died down so much that the servers simply throw everybody together in order to fill the lobby?  (I usually play from either 6-7 AM or 7-9 PM)",9,1585259398,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpkgjr/question_about_sbmm_and_player_count/,apexlegends,2

fpkazv,Scathaa,Solos mode not being offered right now to promote social distancing is a missed opportunity,"I'm not even a big fan of Solos, but given the unique situation that we're in, offering it right now feels like a good idea.

With a limited-time Solos mode, EA doesn't even have to give away anything for free!

I don't need to go in-depth into the advantages of it--more players online, a game mode beloved by a good chunk of the community, and an opportunity to gain some goodwill by harmlessly raising awareness about an issue affecting us all. 

I know if you go to twitch right now you can watch a bunch of streamers and pros play in a fun tournament to raise awareness and money for combating the virus, but really only one tweet advertising it is, IMO, inadequate.",14,1585258871,https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/fpkazv/solos_mode_not_being_offered_right_now_to_promote/,apexlegends,5

For me id say I nearly always refuse to go to the harvester, and train station. Its typically always swarmed with people and the loot is usually not worth the fight. Id rather go to mirage voyage and take that battle. The loot there is usually better and with the chance of getting a vault key from either the cargo bot on ship, or the one that flys next to it, its just more worth it to me.

I just wanted to see what you guys thought.
