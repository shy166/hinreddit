fsmz1p,dntst,Spotify Playlists'R'us! {playlist},"Essentially, I've got a hobby for curating all sorts of playlists for different moods/ vibes/ activities etc---

I make posts like this every once &amp; a while, hoping to bring fresh music to new listeners! (Some artists have millions of listeners, and others are independent musicians, with less than 100 listeners)

Below, I've re-organized the mixes in two main categories of listening--- Hope some of you find some new favorite artists! :)

# Upbeat:

*Upbeat!*

* [indie/ pop party](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0sHQWWfIo86mvMUFhHxDn1?si=tH2Cd-8-R2mcn3PD6sjyog)¬†\[\~1,500 followers, 21+ hours\] {indie pop} ---- a Radio-esque mix. Lots of genre variety! Some Pop. Some Indie.
* [hype (instrumental)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2I0prBy0KCfV4xbOuMC7mE?si=cBaNSuh7R2CXCgSlNKfVww)¬†\[\~600, followers, 11+ hours\] {upbeat electronic} ---- Very upbeat and energetic instrumentals. I like this mix for snowboarding, working out, or when I'm looking for something upbeat, but instrumental.
* [hype](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Q0EVOshx8NMyi5LoP3osv?si=N7L0GmArRvCAoQhp-C9QoQ)¬†\[\~1,800 followers 12+ hours\] {Future Bass} --- High energy! Lots of variety, but all upbeat electronic music! I use this for snowboarding, but could be anything upbeat. Working out. Gaming. Sports. A party/ pregame.

\+ 4)More deleted scenes  
\+ 5)Extra footage with musicians not in the film including: Enslaved, Ted ‚ÄúNocturno

fsivvz,james771998,Bash Music - New Genre [Alternative],"As the current musical landscape is more aesthetically driven then ever, it appears that rootsy music is notably neglected in the mainstream.¬†

But since the early 2010‚Äôs, a raw, raucous, and gritty sound has been quietly developing. I have identified this phenomenon as bash music. A drum heavy style, bash is a blend of rock, new blues, folk, and soul. This new style of declarative, soulful vocals, stomping, striking drums, empowering vocals, and rootsy alternative pop. and percussive symphony brings something different to the music industry.¬†

Several well established and upcoming artists have notably adopted this style.

Check out the Bash Music YouTube playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQPxgtVLJkihoMxkOWg3fbWI32jgJ1yUB](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQPxgtVLJkihoMxkOWg3fbWI32jgJ1yUB)",0,1585681124,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fsivvz/bash_music_new_genre_alternative/,Music,2

The thing is that I'm very picky with the music that I listen to while reading, because if it's something too deep or word-focused like rap I'm going to pay attention to the lyrics instead of the book. I would say my main styles are definitely hip-hop/R&amp;B/neo-soul but I'm totally open to anything you want to suggest that you think may be good for reading.

I eventually took it upon myself to add a lot more stuff, taking from many different sources in order to create a diverse melting pot of music. Bypassing the 10,000 song limit, this is the largest playlist on Spotify, and hopefully it contains something for everyone. From old to new, classic to obscure, accessible to experimental, ambience to harsh noise, BTS to Merzbow. So give it a listen and maybe you'll find something you enjoy.

I'm 20 years old and I've played the guitar since I was 15 or so, had a couple bands... That stuff. Just until I turned like 19 I was a total music addict, always listening to new things, discovering what I liked...It was at that age (18-19) when I got more into hip-hop/rap/trap music and left much of the indie and rock music  that I used to like behind. Nowadays I feel completely lost and I don't even know what kind of music I like or dislike. I need help guys, I don't know if anyone gets me. I want to feel passion for music again, I want to make music again and discover new bands and songs... My creativity and inspiration are gone, but so is my desire to even listen to music actively. Can anybody help me? I want to see again music as a passion, not as a distraction.",3,1585665815,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fse458/i_need_help_to_get_my_passion_for_music_back/,Music,2

fsdfhr,Samjburns,Best used electronic mesh drum kit for under ¬£350?,"Hi i've been looking at a variety of listings on ebay for an electronic mesh drum kit under ¬£350. I have currently saved ¬£105 and I am hoping to sell my Yamaha DtXplorer Dtxpl with an extra cymbal for ¬£250. 
I've had a look at Alesis DM10 drum kits which look good but the cheapest ones have the mylar heads. I would happily buy a mylar head version if it was ¬£250 so I could afford the mesh drum pack from Drum-tec.

Unfortunately, most of them are ¬£350 or higher.

Anyway, Thanks for reading.",2,1585663341,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fsdfhr/best_used_electronic_mesh_drum_kit_for_under_350/,Music,1

So my dad told me that when he was young he was listening to music with his friends every weekend and one time some of his friends got an album which cover art was something like a black background with bamboos in it. So first I thought it would look like Type O Negative's October Rust but with bamboos, y'know? I have no idea what genre it could be but what I know is that my dad was born in 1964 and heard it when he was young, maybe about 15 years or older? So I guess the album can't be from late 80's. Maybe 70's? 60's? (Black background with bamboos)

fsa9bc,Horny_Midget_Orgy,Anyone wanna use my lyrics,"So basically I wrote an emo juice wrld type song, without a beat and I can't make beats. It also happens that my voice sounds very stupid as I am you and a thick boi so I have the slight fat person accent to my voice. The song I wrote was called aching. It 100% üß¢ so don't worry about stealing my story cause it ain't my story. So here it is.

Intro:
She cheated(*long*)
She cheated(yeah, yeah)
She cheated(*long*)
She cheated(yeah, oh, aye)


First verse:
Lil bitch broke my heararart
She Cheated on me, like a thot (in the same way as heart)
Doin that shit drove us apart (^)
Lil bitch is, way too harsh(^)
She ain't worth shit
She ain't even on par(^)

If she wanted to leave, she coulda sai eed sooo o
But she made me bleed, and left a hoo o ole

Used me for cash, to make me baw aw awl

Little bitch thought I couldn't care less (careless)
That's the way it is but it's unfair (unfair)
Booking airfares to get away from this shit (aye)
Fuck this city, and fuck her clique.

Pre chorus:
I Thought that she'd be mine and I'd make her heart unvacant 
She drowned me with her love but She was mother fucking faking it
She broke my heart so bad and now it's (Now it's)

Chorus: 
Aching 
And breaking
Fuck her and her fake shit
I built her up a wall 
but all she ever did was break it
Made me simp for her, 
just so I would buy her fake tits
Treated me like shit, 
fuck finding love I hate it
Now I feel like quitting, 
and I haven't even made it
I hate it
Fuck her and her fake tits
She won't ever make it
Fuck this shit 
I'm aching

Verse 2:
I'm filled with pain 
I'm quaking
I loved it, when I, used to, have her on my bed, shaking

Baking
I still remember all the fun (we had)
When i was munching on her big round buns (yeah eaaah)

Fuck love
Fuck her 
All she wanted was to conquer
They say loves fucked up
And I concur

Pre chorus:
I Thought that she'd be mine and I would make her heart unvacant 
She drowned me with her love but She was mother fucking faking it
She broke my heart so bad and now it's (now it's)

Chorus: 
Aching 
And breaking
Fuck her and her fake shit
I built her up a wall 
but all she ever did was break it
Made me simp for her,
just so I would buy her fake tits
Treated me like shit, 
fuck finding love I hate it
Now I feel like quitting, 
and I haven't even made it
I hate it
Fuck her and her fake tits
She won't ever make it
Fuck this shit I'm aching

End: yeah fuck this shit I'm aching (*slow*)

fs961k,RealJamo,Searching a good song for a video project,"Hey there.

I'll produce a rally-racing video this weekend. It is supposed to have an epic vibe, but should also really bang in the main part.

The script looks something like this (very, very boiled down):

**(Intro) Epic, maybe orchestral, intro**

* Driver walks to his car in a dark storage hall, camera films his feet
* Driver gets filmed from behind, putting on his helmet
* Some shots of the car inside &amp; outside, various shots with the halls light on / off etc.
* Moving on to the street (which will get blocked for our clip)

**(Buildup) Slowly coming closer to the drop**

* Various shots of the car, including top-downs with a drone

**(Main) Drop**

* Filming the car straight from the front, two other cars appear behind the first one (by turning left and right behind the first)
* Several shots of all cars

**End is work in progress...**

* ...

Now onto my question. Does anyone of you know some songs which might fit the script described above?

Some songs that I found:

Imagine Dragons - Battle Cry  
Core of my Addiction - Firefly  
Holywood Horror - Dropout

However, none of them are exactly what I want. It would be great if the song doesn't include vocals, so we have the possibility to record some lines in post without having the problem of two voices in one clip. That can sound very weird.

As said, it should start very epic and mysterious, and the drop has to be intense. I don't mind too much about the genre. Can be rock, can be rap, can be EDM, ...

Thanks alot in advance!

Have a great day and stay healthy ;D",14,1585642896,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fs961k/searching_a_good_song_for_a_video_project/,Music,1

fs7qoh,ApexCactus,Dua Lipa's new song Break My Heart sounds a LOT like INXS and System Of A Down's B.Y.O.B,"I was listening to the new Dua Lipa's new album, and it stroke me that ""Break My Heart"" reminded me of something, but I couldn't put my finger on it, I had it ALL day, and finally, after some demented dive into my music library, I think I found it: The pre chorus reminds me of BYOB by System of a Down, and then I found a video (I'll leave a link to all examples) of a guy that mashed the song to the classic INXS ""I need you tonight"", and yes, the Chorus sounds like that song a lot!

The parts that sound similar (not equal, just similar) are these:   


**Dua Lipa ""Break My Heart"" Pre Chorus:**  
[https://youtu.be/Nj2U6rhnucI](https://youtu.be/Nj2U6rhnucI) 

*""Centre of attention*  
*You know you can get whatever you want from me*  
Whenever you want it, baby  
*It's you in my reflection*  
*I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me*  
If I would've known it, baby""  


**SOAD B.Y.O.B chorus:**  
[https://youtu.be/zUzd9KyIDrM](https://youtu.be/zUzd9KyIDrM)

""Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine""  


**And then the chorus sounds like:** [https://youtu.be/F93ywiGMDnQ](https://youtu.be/F93ywiGMDnQ)  


I mean, I like the song a LOT, but it was discomforting to my mind that I could not point what the heck it reminded to my subconscious. 

I share in case someone thinks this is interesting, it definitely bothered me all day until, literally, just a few minutes ago, I believe the similarities with INXS are NOT accidental, after all the album is called ""Future Nostalgia"" and it clearly has some amazing throwbacks, but the System Of A Down thing, well, I think that's just a coincidence.

By the way, I still feel like I'm missing another song that sounds like it, but I'm still looking, maybe a Madona song? Or Kate Bush? I'm going crazy guy's, *I need help.*

\- The song did not have people but was an animated video, again not with people. It has wallpaper type background and in that song, a girl sits next to the window somewhere

\- It will sound a bit creepy here: She talks about taking a million dollars for sexual favours. The song is very upbeat. 

\- The song didn't have explicit words, but words like ""rough"", ""all night"", etc.

fs74iz,_DanielSanguinetti_,I want to have a career in music but I don‚Äôt know what direction to take,"Background: I began learning guitar in 4th grade, but only during high school did I realize I have a passion for music. I joined band this school year (Grade 12), playing in both concert band (string bass) and jazz band (guitar). I have been accepted into university for chemistry but I want to switch to its music program. I primarily play jazz, classical, and rock/pop during my free time.

I realized that I want to spend my life doing music. I‚Äôve spent the past 3 years of high school questioning what I want to do in the future and I‚Äôve realized now that music is what makes me happy and I cannot just keep it as a hobby. I know for certain that I want a career in music. However, I am well aware that performing musician is a very difficult career. I‚Äôm not sure whether to study composition or teaching, but what I truly want is to perform and play concerts, whether with Symphonic bands or jazz bands or rock bands or whatever.
I wasn‚Äôt able to apply for auditions in time, and I‚Äôll have to wait until next year‚Äôs auditions to get my chance, but I still plan to take any music electives this year. When I saw the requirements for guitar, the expectations are high. What I‚Äôm concerned about is whether it is truly the best direction to take.
I‚Äôve read posts on the classical guitar subreddit that strongly caution this career path for its unfruitful market. I want to be a part of the music program because I feel that it would benefit me as a musician, but I am worried that it is hard work and dedication for a profession that lacks jobs.
I‚Äôm uncertain about what direction to take this career. Although I enjoy science and chemistry, music is what I absolutely want to do. I don‚Äôt know where I could work towards to make a career out of music.
To clarify, I don‚Äôt care too much about money or worldwide fame or anything like that. I‚Äôm happy with being able to support myself or just making my name known locally as long as I get to play music for a living.

fs6up3,Flying-_-Potatoes,Energetic and fast paced rock songs.,"Hello, people! I was trying to make a collection or fast paced rock songs that give an energetic vibe, but aside from the bands I'm acquainted with, it's proven to be a challenge.

I am not the greatest fan of Rock n Roll and classic rock songs. Honestly, I prefer rock songs from the early 2000s and forward.

What I was looking for are things similar to ""Up In Flames"" by Icon For Hire, ""Welcome to Hell"" by Sum 41, ""Pretty Handsome Awkward"" by The Used, ""Dead!"" and ""Boy Division"" by My Chemical Romance, or ""Love Bites"" by Halestorm.

I was thinking of songs that are are fast and don't lose their pace throughout them. It doesn't matter what the song is about, it just needs to have what I described.

All suggestions and recommendations are highly appreciated!",5,1585631074,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fs6up3/energetic_and_fast_paced_rock_songs/,Music,1

Was it just an idea
Maybe a memory
That I saw you right here
Laying next to me 

I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs real
Could be just a dream
Something I made up
But it felt so real to me 

Every minute I can feel
My heart skip a beat
And as the days go by
I become less of me 


I don‚Äôt know if you can hear me now
I‚Äôm six feet under water pretending not to drown
I think I might breath in soon
To escape this padded room
I can‚Äôt take another second 
Wasting time, thinking of you",2,1585622747,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fs4x2p/some_lyrics_i_wrote_opinions_welcome_a_big/,Music,1

fs4gz2,werlkaw,1956 Philips BX756A Tube Amp Information,"Images here: [https://imgur.com/a/YtUwTQn](https://imgur.com/a/YtUwTQn)

I want to surprise my dad by fixing up my grandfather's old tube amp.  
However, I have no idea what I'm doing. I've taken it to a couple of music stores and they don't have much helpful information.  


Ideally, I would love to somehow connect an aux cable and thread it through the back so I can connect a bluetooth module. Is this possible? Am I way in over my head?  


Also, I don't have speakers for this. A guy at a music store told me amps like these used 16ohm or 32ohm speakers. Is this right?  


I also have a modern turntable. Would I be able to connect it directly? Any information would be super valuable! Thanks!",3,1585620980,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fs4gz2/1956_philips_bx756a_tube_amp_information/,Music,1

fs35tu,ethanjacbs1,Feedback for my lyrics,"hi! i am 14 years old and currently investing my time into writing songs! i would love to hear your feedback on it, it would mean the world. i will share a few verses:

a lesson of life 

last year was a setback,
yeah ill admit that
the start to this year feels the same exact
but we gotta keep moving yeah i cant stay last
in that case, as a matter of fact
to those who are here still i tip my hat,
because it feels like a car has run you over flat
all this news that just hits us as if it were a bat
we stay in combat, with the economy 
feel like we being stepped on, call us a mat

feels like the world is laughing, making fun of we
fuck you bitch chill out we just lost kobe
someone may try judge you
hit em with the ""you dont know me""

you dont know what i been through
you think this shits easy like its tying my shoes?
ok yeah it is, but i failed 1000 times
i always felt down, it wasnt sometimes
thinking the only way out is to commit crimes
maybe theres an easier way, like spittin ryhmes
a sport could help i could throw dimes
just know if your going through a, tough time
never hesitate to, hit my line
ill pick up reassure you itll all be fine
just keep going up, call that shit a climb
of course itll get hard,
but that will set to define, who you are,
i send my regards
show no emotion like a poker card
spit these raps so fire feel like they been charred
so i applaud
i dont care where you been i understand if you been scarred
just remember dont let down your guard,
and for god sakes when your angry, dont respond

Basically, I'm that guy who listens to a song minimum 100 times and only then starts getting a little bit bored of the song.
But there is this song | Ayla - Liebe | which I know for many many years ago and to put it like this: no matter how much or when I listen to it I just can't get bored. It's like the frequencies of the song harmonies with my brain or something like that and there is also one part of the song that everytime when I focus on it, it gives me goosebumps and a feeling kinda like hope or something like that.

Yeah, to summarise this mess: I'm  trying to understand the faze or feeling that my brain puts me in when I'm hearing that song, more specifically that part of it. Maybe there is someone who knows how to illuminate me because I feel speechless when I try to describe the sensation that I feel...

fry5pg,kalbells,I'm Kal from Kalbells - Ask Me Anything!,"HI! It's Kal from Kalbells (and Rubblebucket!) here to take any and all of your questions. Kalbells has a new single out called ""Mothertime"" and the full EP drops on April 10th on NNA Tapes. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Lh_H-XvEc) is the video me ÔºÜ my bandmates ÔºÜ charles billot made right before the world turned upside down. and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZk5p-8jn2k) is the video i made for Mothertime this weekend sheltering in place alone in my bedroom with a USB microscope. more about me: I love skinny dipping, apples, and dance parties. I actually just did my first zoom dance party last week and it was pretty sick. What are you guys thinking about!? Are you scared, are you excited, are you mad? I am sad that I can't tour with Kalbells this spring. I'm nervous about the world, but interested to see ÔºÜ understand what's happening. i'm ready for big change, if that's what's coming. my visionwish is for a world that works for everybody. I am thankful for a body that works pretty darn well ÔºÜ time to work on art, especially Kalbells' second full length, getting close! i'm suddenly in love with the internet. my favorite weather is mist. my favorite book is tantric quest by daniel odier. 

Ask me your questions, please make them weird, let's take it there.

Love, Kal

PS. You can find Kalbells on the internet here!

It‚Äôs very often heard in movie trailers with apocalyptic settings, or where I remember this most vividly is in a YouTube video regarding aliens, conspiracies and the end of times.

I understand why these guys are disliked by some and that's  fine but if your ignore that these guys are pretty good. In any mind these guys a sort of musical cross between punk pop bands of the early 2000's and motorhead. Here me out before you question this, don't like rockstar give off a similar vibe to motorhead's frontman, the kind of attitude of women booze and drugs. Photograph though has this early 2000's emo vibe like songs I miss you by blink-182. The lyric quality could use some work like in rockstar but the way it is written shows a good description of the dark side of Hollywood.

frpp71,MusicOnlyArt,Mountain Dulcimer manipulation," [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olftCQIGDJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olftCQIGDJs) 

&amp;#x200B;

This is music made through the manipulation of the mountain dulcimer.

The mountain dulcimer is a fretted instrument.  it is fretted not chromatically, as guitars are, but rather modally.  It is modally fretted in the sense that it is fretted for a major scale except that there are two frets on the 7th position.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this way of making the instrument is to accommodate casuals who don't understand music theory, and that is what makes it more beautiful to me.  I like that there is this instrument that casuals can adopt and use to produce beautiful music.

&amp;#x200B;

Making an instrument fretted specifically to produce one scale and one mode adjacent to it enables casuals to participate in more complicated music.

\[

I recall, for instance, playing cello with a homeless person in the park.  The homeless person had much less access to music theory than I had.  So I said: ""Play in C"", then I initiated modal participation.

&amp;#x200B;

What we ended up making together was the best music I had ever experienced.  It was major and happy Christian music transmogriphied into edgy metal.  Fantastic.

&amp;#x200B;

I produced this wonderful music because I had previously played the Mountain Dulcimer, and therefore knew that there was a modal expansion of the major scale that produced something more interesting than remaining in the major scale.

\]

&amp;#x200B;

I can recall, for instance, being a casual in the production of music, nearby a skilled guitar player.

&amp;#x200B;

We sat together and played through a song we both knew.  It took long enough to play this song that other people showed up, in our music department.  In short order, we were playing a piece with fifteen people present.

&amp;#x200B;

It was funny to me, because there was nothing I could in all my life that would make 14 other people arrive with me playing music with me, but lo I had arrived with Michael on his guitar, and we made 15 people play alongside us a good song.

&amp;#x200B;

I sat at the base of this, manipulating my mountain dulcimer.

In context, it was an instrument for generating harmony.

\--So, I arrived with Michael, the good man.  I sat down with him with his guitar, and I played my mountain dulcimer.  And we sat and played, and people arrived and arrived.

&amp;#x200B;

We made together a moment where everyone arrived and played together.  People sat down, all their instruments in hand, and played alongside our idea about how the music should proceed.

I may not have made it right, but I manipulated the mountain dulcimer as it made sense inside that crowd, and it was beautiful, it was magnificent.

&amp;#x200B;

In one short expanse of peoples' gap-time between their daily requisites, lo, they arrived in that room with me and Michael and they made music,  and lo I made music with them by manipulating the mountain dulcimer.",1,1585570505,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/frpp71/mountain_dulcimer_manipulation/,Music,1

I try to go to youtube music and most of that stuff like mumble rap just doesn't appeal to my old man ears.

I really like catchy stuff though even though most pop doesn't do it for me.  The most poppy stuff Ive found recently would be Grimes though.  Loving almost all of her stuff.  

Other artsists I like would be Jon Hopkins, Feed Me, Boards of Canada, Zero7.

I'll occasionally stumble across music on youtube from years ago with millions of views that I'd just never heard of.  And I'm like damn I wish I could have found that sooner.

The playlist when listened to in order is an attempt to outline Eminem's life through his songs. Started at his LP and his hardships of being an early broke rapper to his relapse and drug addiction to his 'Recovery' and some milestones scattered throughout. Have a listen from start to finish and feel free to suggest any other songs to add and in which order.

frizm1,pancreatic-bagels,Music as a form of religion,"I‚Äôm wondering what songs exist out there that equate music to religion or talk about the power of music in a semi-religious context. 

The best example of this would by ‚ÄúMy Church‚Äù by Maren Morris which has lines like ‚Äúfeels like the Holy Ghost running through you when I play the highway FM‚Äù and the entire song is her equating the radio to a church. 

Other songs that fall into that line of thought would be ‚ÄúSave Rock and Roll‚Äù by Fall Out Boy, ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù by Don McLean, and ‚ÄúMusic is Healing‚Äù by Florida Georgia Line. So basically any song that talks about music being powerful and a form of salvation. Thanks!",12,1585537115,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/frizm1/music_as_a_form_of_religion/,Music,1

Sure enough he did (duh,) this also sparked his love for the Underground scene of Hip Hop.

This was in 97‚Äô for him, and now it‚Äôs 2020, my pops showed me that album back in 2016 (we were the same age when we heard it) and upon further research while trying to find this album, I found out there is a demo version that they pressed as an 8-track with the original recordings.

But yes, I had a question. I've really been wanting to do some singing over some certain songs, but without the actual singing in them already. Specifically, the songs are as follows:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ7H4tZa8-k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ7H4tZa8-k) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-PBHg3JLcA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-PBHg3JLcA) 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't actually know how to get the singing removed, and there also aren't any versions of the songs online that are already instrumental. So, is there any way that I can go about this myself? Or would I have to get someone specific to do it? I'm honestly not completely sure on what can be done, but I'd love to know regardless if anyone can help.

So far I've been using my Google Home but I'd like to upgrade to a better sound system.
I like a bass a lot. I have a 4.1 LG sound bar + subwoofer in my room that I love but the sound doesn't reach well the other side of the basement.
I currently have a budget of about $300 - 400 CAD.
I am confused as to if I should get  bookshelf , standing, Bluetooth or sound bar speakers

frbm3a,DavidSupersonicM,Calling All Astronauts - Give Them A Leader (Official Video),"  

**CALLING ALL ASTRONAUTS** have sculpted a merger of Goth and Electro Punk which rampages whilst pushing the boundaries of band and genre. The highly rated goth punks tear open the envelope even Further with the release of their new album ***#Resist***, out Friday 5th June. The irrepressible trio have launched the build up with the release of a new single and video **‚ÄúGive Them A Leader‚Äù** mixed by Grammy Award winning producer Alan Branch (NIN, U2, Depeche Mode).

CALLING ALL ASTRONAUTS were born in 2013 and are comprised of David B (Vocals, Programming, Keys, Producing), Paul McCrudden (Bass, Guitar, Keys), and J Browning (Guitar). All three members from CALLING ALL ASTRONAUTS have rich experiences and adventures arching back from their time with seminal Rap-Metalers, US:UK. As US:UK they soldout many established venues such as Koko, The Marquee, and the legendary London Astoria, and all of this was done as an unsigned band. US:UK also opened for such luminaries as Faith No More, 24/7 Spyz and Neds Atomic Dustin. After US:UK ran its course, J went on to form Pop-Punkers Caffeine, Paul joined Goth stalwarts The Marionettes, and David went into band management.

Fast forward to a chance meeting between J and David, and both were excited about making music again. They soon picked up where they left off and everything clicked, resulting in them releasing their debut album Post Modern Conspiracy in 2013. Paul McCrudden then entered the fray to reunite the three-piece as they set to work on their second album, Anti-Social Network, which was released in 2016. To date, the band have released ten singles, six EPs and two albums, and have had five #1‚Äôs on Hype Machine‚Äôs Twitter Music Chart, as well as having been featured by many radio stations worldwide. The electro punks have played esteemed festivals such as Kendal Calling, Guilfest, Beautiful Days, and have also opened for the likes of Pop Will Eat Itself and APTBS.

fradpx,ZiDes21,Roger Waters is amazing!,"I've been listening to Pink Floyd for a while now, and I've only gotten through like half their stuff - the mainstream stuff. Neck and neck with DSOTM for my favourite Floyd record is The Wall - this shit is mind boggling! I know that Roger wrote most of the songs on this thing and sang just about all of them too. This man is madness, I really don't understand how anyone could ever come up with such... I don't even know what to call it! Not to downplay the roles the other lads each played, as the sound of Floyd was theirs as a collective and not just due to Waters. But, the lyrics and overall sound Roger steers them torwards is inconceivable to me, even the man's singing (which isn't his forte) on here is crazy, pulls right at my heart strings. Vera Is mad!! Is there anyone quite like Roger Waters out there anywhere in music history?! Any one who can impact an man's soul like he does?! These are serious questions people!! On a sidenote, Floyd as a whole is unbeatable to me, I don't care what anyone says!",6,1585505755,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fradpx/roger_waters_is_amazing/,Music,3

fr9b9n,TheCityShuffle,The City Shuffle - An interactive music city I created to help combat loneliness &amp; boredom.,"I suspect that you are reading this out of a lack of anything else to do. Maybe you are bored after days on end in self-isolation and, like myself, are in dire need of entertainment. Maybe you are alone and, like myself, are in need of some good company. It's normal to feel both of those things, but hopefully I have something that could help.

What if I told you that I have built a virtual city that will not only entertain you, but also connect you with others through a common love of music. It will take some patience and tweaks will need to be made, but hopefully we can make a few friends and discover some new music along the way.

Plug in, sound up, escape.

Nestled on the coast of nonexistence, a city with no name buzzes softly as the glow of dawn glides across the great lake. Whether you awaken perfectly rested or with a sore head, the City welcomes you with open arms.

Daydream to the sounds of Nilsson and Springsteen on¬†***The Tracks FM***¬†during an early tram ride to¬†***Caf√© Du Soul***¬†for your daily coffee fix. Go grab some lunch on the docks before checking the City's monthly newsletter at the¬†***Plaza***¬†for upcoming events and openings. Here you can also chat to your fellow city dwellers, share ideas, new music and get excited about upcoming festivals...

In the afternoon you can take a long stroll through¬†***Astral Gardens,***¬†one of the many parks soon to be on offer. On a rainy day¬†***La Lumi√®re Cinema***¬†awaits, complete with the compelling sounds of Zimmer, Shore, Reznor and many more.

Dusk is when the city really comes alive, with a variety of pubs, bars and restaurants all set to open their doors in the coming weeks. Why not head on over to¬†***505***¬†for some old-school indie intoxication,¬†***GROW***¬†for the best new music or the ever-so-popular¬†***Shrine***¬†for weekly live sets \[*now performing:*¬†Chris Cornell\]**.**

The majority of the city's buildings are still under renovation, so you can expect exciting new openings on a weekly basis, along with a few more surprises along the way.

fr8woa,rTheBeardedGuitarist,Brazilian Groove | Bossa Nova/Samba (Batucada),"Hi, hope you‚Äôre all staying home and keeping safe.

Here‚Äôs a new video showing a Brazilian groove. Helpful if you‚Äôre into bossa nova/samba or jazzy rhythms and chords.

It‚Äôs a one chord groove, moving between three positions of an A major. (A add9, Amaj9, A6/9)

What‚Äôs interesting is the right hand fingerstyle pattern which involves some clich√©s of Brazilian music like alternating the bass between the root and the 5th of the chord or a few rhythm anticipations, one of them involving the bass note.

This rhythm is typical of a sub-style of samba called Batucada and the repeating pattern is called ‚Äúrepinique‚Äù.

Here is the full video with shapes and fingerstyle pattern: [https://youtu.be/1X7smH\_3Kp0](https://youtu.be/1X7smH_3Kp0)

Hope you enjoy this Brazilian groove.

fr549o,jaej_eong,"Music Creators, How did you convince your parents?","Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôm a 16 year old kid in Korea and I‚Äôve been singing for as long as I can remember. Recently (around 3 weeks ago or so) I started to make my own music. I‚Äôve been uploading to YouTube and Soundcloud, and got around 140 subscribers on YouTube within 3 weeks. I understand that this is very little, but still - it was very motivating for me.

The thing is, especially in Korea everything is about studying. Study to succeed, study to become a doctor - every asian stereotype you‚Äôve heard about us is probably true. Well, I‚Äôm pretty good at that, the studying part. I don‚Äôt mean to brag but simply so you guys can understand my situation better, I‚Äôve been accepted into the most prestigious high school in the country (around 300 students picked yearly and thousands apply) so understandably, my parents want me to keep studying and keep this ‚Äúmusic‚Äù thing out of my way.

Well, I don‚Äôt want to pursue a career in music but I sure as hell want to keep making my own music, provided it doesn‚Äôt mess with my studying that much. Here‚Äôs where the convincing part comes in.. I currently own a cheap USB mic that I bought from working online (graphic design) which my parents made me quit as well. It does the job but it sounds terrible, so I‚Äôd like to upgrade - of course, with my own money - but my parents are going livid at the mention of buying music equipment, even if it‚Äôs for a hobby. 

For me music is a way of expressing my feelings and letting out stress from studying 8-9 hours every day with no rest (outside of school) and although I enjoy academics as well music has been a dear friend to a very lonely me in Korea.

So, to the music creators on here, have you guys ever been in situations like this? How did you overcome it?",1,1585484672,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fr549o/music_creators_how_did_you_convince_your_parents/,Music,1

fr3zzl,Xolo1015,Can an Artist/Musician make other kinds of music then what their most popular genre perceives them as?,"I'm going to make this short. I feel like a lot of times as an artist I over think this. I'm constantly worried that if I my music does or when it does eventually take off that I'll be secluded to making on that type of music. I know that multiple artist have proven time and time again with people in the industry like Kid Cudi, Kanye, and even Drake that you can diversify your music. My main fear is simply just coming up in the industry as one thing, instead of just something more broad. 

Once again, clearly I'm not saying I'm going to have success like overnight obviously, but I'm just expressing my own thoughts while I constantly make my own songs. How do you believe artist avoid that stigma of being affiliated with one genre and one genre of music only and do you think its acceptable for an artist to step into experimenting with their sound and music, even if it went against their foundations of what brought their career? Would you still even listen to your favorite artist if they decided to want to try something new?

fr3eon,Vanilla-Plain,"Completely subjective test / comparison of TIDAL Hifi, Spotify and Amazon Music HD","  

**Prehistory / motivation:**

I bought Sennheiser HD 660 S headphones and the Apogee Groove as amplifier. I used Spotify for years and was satisfied so far. However, I thought that I‚Äòd like to use the streaming service with the best audio quality for my new headphones. I guessTIDAL, Spotify and Amazon Music HD are potentially suitable. I subscribed to all services (you can cancel quickly) and tested the services with different songs in a direct comparison. Here is the result of my **completely subjective** test.

**3rd place: TIDAL**

TIDAL positions itself as a service with outstanding sound quality. In direct comparison with each other, I found the quality - completely subjective ‚Äì to be the worst. The sound lacked clarity; it was a little duller than the competition. However, you could hear all the details. The songs consistently had a very high resolution. The quiet sensitive search function is also annoying, e. g. to find 21 pilots you have to enter ""Twenty One Pilots"" an not use the spelling ""21 pilots"". That is not solved well. The service regularly costs ‚Ç¨ 19.99 in the hifi subscription, making it the most expensive provider in comparison.

**2nd place: Spotify (winner price-performance)**

Spotify is the best all-rounder. You can find almost all songs. Using it is very simple and intuitive. The sound quality is really good. In direct comparison, I noticed that the songs are relatively loud. You shouldn't be blinded by this. I always reduced the volume to the required level. The songs were very clear and powerful. Compared to TIDAL and Amazon Music HD, however, a little less detailed. This minimal difference can only be noticed in a direct comparison of the services. Spotify ist my personal price-performance recommendation! With ‚Ç¨ 9.99, Spotify is the cheapest provider.

**1st place: Amazon Music HD (best audio quality)**

In my view, Amazon Music HD had the best sound quality. The sound was very clear. Above all, very detailed. You often discover new details in the songs when you listen to them on Amazon Music HD. The 3D songs are a nice gimmick. Using it is also very simple and intuitive. The service costs ‚Ç¨ 12.99 a month (with existing Prime membership). I have the impression that this service is getting the best out of my new headphones. You get a maximum of audio quality.",2,1585475009,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fr3eon/completely_subjective_test_comparison_of_tidal/,Music,1

fr2onh,Legoman195,Online jukebox?,"Hi, 

I have a poker match and we have an open chat. People are always playing their music to share what they are listening to but it creates problems for the game. 

Is there a site that will allow anyone to upload mp3s and then play each one. One by one. The idea is that each player (when they are out of the game) can load up a track and it will come on later in the night. 

It would also mean that people would have it playing in one headphone rather than openly and can op in and out of a track if they want. 

Thanks,

fr1g6x,photosN,How do you actually share and talk about the artist (((o))) without forcing word of mouth?: A Speculative Discussion on SEO and Recommendation Ask,"Listening to the song ""Nature's Joint"" by ((( o ))) has me a little perplexed and a lotta confused on how to share an artist who is only reachable by web link, discussion, or Shazam or text or by word of mouth.

New upcoming artists almost never have noteriety enough to be searched on by random people (like me who just learned of this artist through my Spotify Discover page months ago), simply due to saturation at that level, so a unique name is almost necessary. Modern times require shares and hashtags and social media at many points of the Guide to Stardom. 

For artists who attempt to deny the spotlight through sheer force of will like (((o))), who has no social media presence or physical presence *like concerts* (and is unsearchable on social media apps due to the ((( and ))) SEO mechanisms of most services), (see how confusing all these paragraphs are to sentence structure? That's why it's ignored in SEO) and shuns a regular lifestyle living in the empty reaches of Menilla... The only way you can really understand that your music is actually doing well is by the checks that come in.

Unless she has her checks deposited to a separate account that pays her rent that she never sees, which I can't help but give the benefit of the doubt.

I guess that not only am I wondering about (((o))) but are there other artists doing just that, that no one knows about? Does there exist a modest enough artist out there, at that extreme? Can you please share them? I'd love to give them a listen too!

Was that enough parentheses?

I love this whole song with my heart.

It hits differently now, with all this crap going on.

I love when the robot choir sings ""wonder wonder wonder"" in lowering pitch after the second verse. Just so harmonically beautiful.

And the guitar riff. God, I love it. And the tambourine hitting those 16th notes. mm, thats good shit.

I love the line ""With it's ivory towers, and plastic flowers, I wish I were back in 1981"". The song, about a lonely time traveler, was released in 1981 along with the time album. Such a cool line to look back on.

AND WHEN THE DRUMS COME IN FOR VERSE 3. YEs.

fqzdps,BorrowYourBrain,Do you think Billie Eilish is authentic? I don't.,"I'll start off with my perspective but feel free to skip and just post a response below! Curious to know what other think about her. 

I first hear Billie's music about a year ago and didn't care for it. A couple months ago, I started watching videos of her and her brother Finneas on Youtube and all of the sudden I LOVED her. I thought she was relatable, funny, down to Earth... ""authentic"". I loved that she was homeschooled (like me!) but wasn't totally socially awkward (like me lolol.)  That her and her brother ""made music in their bedroom"" (ANYONE CAN DO IT U GUYZ) But then I stumbled across videos of people accusing her of being an ""industry plant"" - before I knew it I was in the Billie Eilish rabbit hole haha but yeah it does seem like her and her brother (and the media) are painting an image of them being relatable, having ""pure"" talent/passion/drive, of being popular BECAUSE they are so talented and driven, etc. When in reality their parents are connected to the industry and well of, Billie her brother have literally been PAVED a life of success, but they downplay their privilege for their persona. 

  
The way they advertise their stories, it's very ""you can do it to""ish, which makes it even more likeable - it gave me this feeling of ""wow if I just worked hard enough on something I could become rich and famous from my bedroom if I wanted to."" Meanwhile, a bunch of kids are thinking the same thing I am, except they are purchasing the same equipment Billie and her brother used to create music in an attempt to get famous the same way. There's money made that wouldn't otherwise be made if Billie and her brother chose the narrative of ""oh even if you do what we did, you wouldn't be as famous with the right connections""   
Now, I don't know if this is their doing, their label company, all 3, whatever, but it's clear that the media is on their side. Painting them very positively. And I feel like I kinda felt for it a little bit. Regardless, I still really love their music and I will continue to listen to it; they are definitely still talented no question about it! I love their vision and I how they chose to bring it to life. And I understand that celebrities use personas all the time (for privacy, to separate work and home, etc) - I just don't LOVE that their ""authentic"" characteristic is LITERALLY just a part of their persona. AND THAT I FELL FOR IT lol  


I also feel like Billie will be torn apart by the media in the next few years. Like she is their pawn, as much as Brittany Spears or Kesha. I don't know if she is aware of this.  

Anyone else relate? Disagree?

fqzcfr,AppreciateGreatness,"(Rap) Opinion: There's nothing wrong with ""Old School"" or ""New School"" Rap, both are great","Just to make things clear, I don't hate rap. I've been listening to rap since I was eight, but I feel like the current state of rap is frustrating. We're split between people who are diehard fans of rappers like Nas or Biggie and people who are fans of newer rappers like Uzi or Travis. I feel the three most important parts of any good rap are lyrics, the beat, and the flow. ""Old school"" fans seem to prioritize lyrics over beat and flow, while ""New school"" fans prioritize the beat (both fan bases recognize the importance of the flow). I'm not saying that there aren't new rappers that have great lyrics, like J Cole or Joey Badass, I'm saying that most ""new school"" fans prioritize the beat of a song. There are plenty of new rappers that rap in an old school style.

I think it's important for anybody who is fan of rap to recognize that music is subjective and that some people just prefer new school over old school, or vice versa. I've been seeing a lot of top 50 rappers lists posted lately and I think the backlash some get for their lists is ridiculous, that is THEIR list just because your favorite rapper isn't #1 doesn't mean it's a bad list. I wish more people would understand this because I feel that if everyone understood this there wouldn't be as deep of a divide in rap currently.",1,1585454065,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fqzcfr/rap_opinion_theres_nothing_wrong_with_old_school/,Music,1

fqyduy,Beasts_at_the_Throne,"In my opinion, System of a Down is not and never was a nu-metal band.","Maybe this is a popular sentiment. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve seen them mentioned in the same circles. 

But I genuinely do not believe System of a Down was a part of the nu-metal movement. Looking at their first album, their sound seems to me to have grown more from the likes of proto-metal such as Prong and Clutch, grunge and sludge such as Melvins, and of course Les Claypool. 

Aside from the obvious common denominator Metallica (name a rock back after 1990 that wasn‚Äôt in some way inspired by them), I don‚Äôt really see much connection to acts such as Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit. You could argue that hip hop is a connector, which is reasonable considering there was this weird SoaD/Wu-Tang collab way, way back even before their first album had dropped. You could argue vocalist Serj Tankian is somewhat influenced by hip hip in his vocal delivery. I can agree. 

I wouldn‚Äôt agree that it is an aspect of their sound to the degree of the likes of even Slipknot however. If System of a Down borrowed a hip hop motif of any kind it was shone through the lens of their loud, hard rock sound. System of a Down incorporated some hip hop influences but incorporated them into their sound rather than taking rock and hip hop and cramming then together like some awful Oreo cookie. 

Anyway, I outgrew my SoaD phase more than a decade ago but I still appreciate them to this day. Here‚Äôs to hoping a miracle happens and we get just one more album! If Tool can come back after nearly two decades, anything is possible!",4,1585450110,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fqyduy/in_my_opinion_system_of_a_down_is_not_and_never/,Music,1

fqy5n6,Drax343,How would you rank the decades of music ?,"My personal ranking would be-

1. The 90s- one word- variety. There was good soft rock, good hard rock, good hip hop, passionate female singers, riot grrl, jazz, classical, you name it this decade had it all. Other decades had a distinctive sound, not the 90s, it had all the sounds

2. 70s- There were so many artistic leaps made in this generation and there was so much variety and quantity of good music even if it was mostly rock, of which it was the golden age.

3. 60s- Can also be considered the golden age of rock along with the 70s. Though didn‚Äôt have its variety and quantity it still had a lot. 2 words- the beatles.

4. 80s- It was time of political and social conservatism so the music industry was maybe a bit stifled and popular music had to appeal more to social norms and mores but there was still a tonne of good music. Hard rock and hip hop were born.

5. 50s- the infancy of rock and roll. Also a golden age of smooth jazz.

6. The 2010s- more variety in music. Pop music began to recover a bit and have good messages and ideas. Autotune use decreased. More diversity than had been seen in some time. Some return to classic rock-esque roots.

7. 40s- the birth of rock and roll, good decade for smooth jazz

8. 30s- the birth of smooth jazz

9. 2000s- A bunch of auto-tuned crap. There were maybe 5 good mainstream songs in the whole decade. Though alternative music faired better. Almost every song was about sex, break-ups or some other BS.",6,1585449186,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fqy5n6/how_would_you_rank_the_decades_of_music/,Music,1

fqtssk,ThorMagurowitz,Wholesome music?,"I realise the music I'm listening to is about anger and shame and self loathing and inner badness.

I've had a few problems with depression and negative self talk. I think I'm at the point where I don't have the self talk anymore, but I think I've internalised it enough that sometimed I feel bad or guilty or ashamed innately, without a specific thought or verbalised idea in my head. Just the emotion.

I think it's time to listen to some music that heals. The opposite of what I'm listening to now. Music that tells me I'm good. Music that doesn't trigger me to feel bad things and take me to dark places. Hopeful and optimistic. Music that builds me up.

Any suggestions?",9,1585433483,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/fqtssk/wholesome_music/,Music,1
