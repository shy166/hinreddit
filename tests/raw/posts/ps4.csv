fso4e3,OneFreeGordon,"Trophy hunters, why do you do it? üèÜ","A friend recently asked me why I bother going for the platinum trophy on any of my games.

He thinks trophy hunting is a waste of time and doesn‚Äôt add anything to a game experience. I‚Äôm the polar opposite, I take great pride in finishing a game to absolute completion, DLC trophies and all. If I don‚Äôt see 100% right down my list I just don‚Äôt feel completely fulfilled in any of my achievements.

I see it as a something of a bragging right, to show that I‚Äôve mastered a game and experienced everything  that it has to offer. It also helps me justify the financial investment to know that I‚Äôve squeezed every last drop of entertainment that I can out of a game.

My question for all the other trophy hunters out there is, what is it that drives you to fill up that trophy cabinet?

fsnz9e,Jamesjane5,Is it weird for a Souls fan to like Sekiro and dislike Nioh?,"I'm a Souls fan and I've played almost every souls-like games. But for some stupid reason I couldn't get myself to like Nioh games at all. Played both and got bored half way. It's not because they are challenging, it's just that I'm not fond of the loot system and how the level design looks. The enemies being frequently reused bothered me too. On the other hand, Sekiro got me hooked. Sure I suck at that fcking game due to my habits with souls gameplay, but I loved it. Now it would make more sense to be the other way around since Nioh is closer to Souls than Sekiro right? But for me it's weird like that.

I've been in the market for a good PS4 headset (wired or wireless) that has great sidetone/mic monitoring. My budget is $100-$120. 

Loud sidetone is extremely important since I hate not being able to hear myself talk. 

I used to own an Arctis 7 but the sidetone on console was laughable at best. So I ended up selling them on eBay.

fsnq65,Brosso05,DS4 connection after connecting to phone,"Hello! So I got retroarch on my phone and tried to play a game by connecting my Dualshock 4 controller via bluetooth. When it came down to connecting it back to the PS4, it first tried to connect back to the phone. So I went through my bluetooth settings and ended the connection with the phone. I plugged to controller on the PS4, hit the PS button and all it does is flash a few times a light blue, then closes. It does charge though, when connected via USB, the light is yellow. This is what I tried:

- I tried 5 different USB cables, including the original one, while closed, resting, opened or unplugged;
- I tried both USB ports with said USB cables;
- I tried resetting the controller with the reset button on the back for 5-10 seconds on multiple occasions (PS4 opened, closed, resting and unplugged);
- I tried the method on the PS troubleshoot where it says to unplug your router as well;
- I tried reconnecting to my phone via bluetooth just to see if the controller works and it did work perfectly;
- I tried unplugging the PS4 for 2 minutes to 1 hour;
- tried charging the controller for a few hours;
- I tried the share + PS buttom bluetooth search method.

I think that's it, nothing work for now, tried all the methods I could find except connecting another PS4 controller and adding mine as a second, because I'm quarantined and only have 1. Do I need a new controller because I just seem to be unable to connect?

fsnhpm,Slicerknight,The bias against players with no mics,"Today, I‚Äôve had a bad day playing Friday the 13th: The Game on the PlayStation 4. I play with a group of people who competes in competitions for a prize or money. I don‚Äôt really take part in those since I‚Äôm just here to play the game. I have a pair of headphones with a built in microphone. It was fun, playing and talking to these people. I‚Äôve been playing with them for a few years now. They‚Äôve been pushing me to get something with a microphone ever since. I finally found something to use, and it was amazing!

One day, my microphone stopped working, but the headphones still worked. I guess I got up and pulled a wire as it got caught on my leg or something. But today, I‚Äôve been kicked out of a group of people live-streaming, that I didn‚Äôt know well, because my mic didn‚Äôt work and they thought I was cheating by ‚Äúbody-blocking.‚Äù It‚Äôs funny because I was trying to keep my distance from everybody. In fact, I had no idea if I accidentally blocked someone or not. Anyways, the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù said I body-blocked him twice. I apologized to him through text after I died in the game. Then, they kicked me from the party and abandoned the server we were in, leaving me all alone.

I sighed and went to one of the people from the older group I played with. I told him I got the demo to a Predator game that comes out this April. I also told him about the streamer, since he recently joined our old group. The streamer had upset me numerous times, and I thought it was only fair that I tell someone I trust about his senselessness. The old ‚Äúfriend‚Äù then tells me that I can‚Äôt play the Predator game with them if I don‚Äôt have a mic. I was infuriated and told him, ‚ÄúThat is stupid.‚Äù 

After thinking for a bit, I realized that my whole group is not very nice to people without mics. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve transformed into somebody they despise. I don‚Äôt care if anyone doesn‚Äôt have a mic. When mine was still working, I talked to them, and they responded well to my yes and no questions. Friday the 13th: the Game has emotes for a reason. I‚Äôve had a bad history with PS4 gamers with mics always blaming me for stuff as if video games are the only thing they care about. In the games I‚Äôve played, I noticed that people with mics don‚Äôt interact or help the people without them. Just because someone doesn‚Äôt have the same kind of technology as someone else does not mean that the people with mics has to treat them terribly or ignore them entirely. In Friday the 13th: the Game, the streamer‚Äôs group that I just joined told each other to not help me as I was dying. I felt terrible. I could hear everything, but I couldn‚Äôt say anything. What happens if people can‚Äôt afford a microphone? Maybe they‚Äôre too young to go shopping by themselves. Or maybe they physically can‚Äôt talk. Online video games are meant to gather everybody in and let them have fun together. But the more I play, the more I find myself drawn away by other people‚Äôs nasty talk. I‚Äôm not saying that people with mics are terrible people. I‚Äôm just saying that people without mics should be noticed and treated as equals to people with mics. It takes a lot of money to play online games in the first place. You need to pay for a computer or gaming console, and you need to pay for a strong-enough internet connection. In my opinion, microphones and headphones are completely optional, because you don‚Äôt need them to play online video games.",9,1585695767,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fsnhpm/the_bias_against_players_with_no_mics/,PS4,0

Just got my quarantine ps4 a few days ago and it‚Äôs been awesome so far. Except one small thing. 

My ps gold headphones are GARBAGE. They worked for 2 days... a whopping, literal, 6 hours. 

I did some searching around and saw *lots* of people have had my same issue: the headset will connect but doesn‚Äôt actually play sound. (Yes it has power. Yes the volume is up. Yes it‚Äôs set to ‚Äúall audio‚Äù) im brand new to consoles and gaming but not technologically-illiterate. 

When I put the cable into the controller and into the headset, the sound works perfectly.  So the speakers/wiring aren‚Äôt faulty. 

I tried resetting with the dongle side button + hold mute/vss and got nothing. I tried wiring the headset directly to the console and using the headset companion app to ‚Äúrestore‚Äù and reset the headset and update and ... still got nothing. But using the wire they still work, so I‚Äôm pretty sure the dongle is faulty. Since the headset is literally 2 days old I‚Äôm just going to return them, not a huge deal,  but I‚Äôm not interested in owning another pair. Because garbage. 

But it brings me to a crossroads. Having the headset wired isn‚Äôt a huge deal, actually, but I thought it would be. so maybe I should just get a cheaper headset that‚Äôs meant to actually be wired? Or are there other wireless sets in the same price range **that are not made by sony** that I should look at? 150 budget not trying to go nuts here.

fsmipw,Jherba200,Dualshock 4 buttons dont work when pressed together?,"Hey people! Couldn't find anything online to do with this so I'm hoping someone could help me!

I play a lot of UFC 3 and to do a lead uppercut you press triangle and circle together but recently this has completely stopped working.

They work when pressed separately so I dont really understand.

I've done a reset on the controller by putting a pin into the little button on the back and had no result, I've also just played another game where these buttons had to be pressed together to perform a certain action and again, no luck!

I'm not really in the position to buy a new controller currently so hopefully someone could shine some light on a solution for me!

fslek4,BrightDarkness16,PS4: DualShock 4 ground loop with Turtle Beach X12,"I use a Turtle Beach X12 with a Turtle Beach Ear Force DSS to get game audio on my PS4 and I use a 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable to connect the headset to my controller to use the microphone. I‚Äôve recently realized that if I try to use the microphone while the DualShock 4 is plugged into/charging with the USB port, it emits a loud buzzing sound that makes my voice barely audible and annoys other people in the party.

I looked this issue up before and I saw people saying to use a ground loop isolator to fix the buzzing. So I tried 2 things:

1) using the isolator on the green cable that plugs into the DSS for audio. Didn‚Äôt do anything, the buzzing persists.

2) using the isolator on the 3.5mm end of the mic cable, so the isolator plugs directly into the DualShock 4 and the 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable plugs into the headset as well as the other end of the isolator. Doesn‚Äôt seem to work either, because my PS4 straight up says I don‚Äôt have a mic plugged in this way.

My main question is is there something I‚Äôm missing with method 2? Everyone online seemed to think this was the solution but it‚Äôs not doing anything for me.

In addition, I saw some people saying to just charge the controller ahead of playing/plug it into the wall instead of the PS4 to solve the buzzing. This does NOT solve my problem, as the reason I have the controller plugged into the PS4 in the first place is to use it as a USB controller and eliminate the input lag that comes with using it wirelessly.",0,1585689003,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fslek4/ps4_dualshock_4_ground_loop_with_turtle_beach_x12/,PS4,0

fsjr4p,DXE18,Fun Games to Platinum? (Preferably similar to HZD),"Hi everyone,

Since the lockdown started I‚Äôve decided to spend a lot of time getting platinum trophies for games I love again. My most recent platinum was Horizon Zero Dawn.

I tried to get into it a couple years ago and it just didn‚Äôt click with me so I gave up on it before I even left the Nora Sacred Land. I recently decided to give it another try and needless to say it absolutely incapsulated me. I haven‚Äôt been able to stop playing, and I‚Äôve just finished my 3rd new game plus run in 2 days (I‚Äôve been getting pristine coils in the hopes of being fully geared up for another ultra hard Playthrough). However I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm going to burnout on it and considering how much I love playing it I don‚Äôt want that to happen.

So to the point of this post, I want another game to platinum that‚Äôs preferably similar to Horizon Zero Dawn in terms of the addictive feel, good story, fun gameplay and fairly relaxed and enjoyable platinum experience (except for the fire claws in ultra hard mode, fuck you). Also I don‚Äôt want any games with ‚Äúonline trophies‚Äù unless they‚Äôre doable in split screen. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you :)",20,1585683820,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fsjr4p/fun_games_to_platinum_preferably_similar_to_hzd/,PS4,0

I no longer have PS+ so using cloud save is not currently available. I was going to complete the DLC content during our quarantine, and unable to load my saved content.

I also tested my other save files and am having the same issue with other games.

I called PS support, but due to the corona virus they were closed. I re-initialized my console and logged out and back into my profile, unfortunately nothing has worked.

I'm encountering a very odd situation with my desktop to my PS4 over my local network via Remote Play. Currently, when running Remote Play at any setting, my connection will lag every couple of minutes causing severe stuttering and resolution drop. I've run a ping to the PS4 and the connection is ~5ms until the lag spikes and I will see +100ms or a timeout. The really odd thing is that my phone running Android RP or my laptop sitting next to the desktop run perfectly with no spikes at all frame rates and resolutions. The PS4 is hardwired into my WLAN (google Nest) and I'm on AT&amp;T gigabit fiber. Also, I can't hardwire my desktop due to the location of my office.

Steps Taken:

* Updated wifi drivers (Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A) to the latest version
* Disabled ""Allow downloads from other PCs"" in Windows Update
* Disabled location sharing
* Flushed dns, reset winsock, release/renew local IP
* Ran netsh wlan set autoconfig enabled=no interface=""Wi-Fi""
* Disabled all other applications/programs sending network packets
* Stopped any other local streaming

Desktop Specs:

* I-7 7700K
* Z270E Strix MoBo (BIOS 1302)
* GTX1080 FTW (Drivers 445.75)

However, in the last few days, I can join parties, but there's a constant flashing on everyone's mics and I can't hear anyone. Sometimes it eventually loads after 5 minutes but everyone sounds like robots with very fuzzy voices. It's odd. Then it will randomly kick me out.
I've never had these issues until this week. I've ran tests and everything is fine. I have no connection issues when playing games, and stay at a steady 30 ping when playing. Voice chats in game work fine, it's only ps4 parties that are the issue.

fsi1w7,S5EX1dude,Playing the Uncharted Remastered Collection made me realize how much I wish a Thief sequel was in the works,"I've never played the Uncharted games before now, but every so often the game mechanics just make me wish I was playing a new version of Thief! 

I love looking for clues and 'treasures', but Thief in my opinion had a much more fun atmosphere of using 'focus' to see things more clearly (hints), hidden pathways to find (and a more open world - yet not overly so), stealthy combat and takedowns, combat using bow &amp; arrows with specialized arrows for different purposes like shooting a ladder down or something to knock out a guard (instead of large gunfights with continuous streams of enemies and the occasionally well placed propane tank).  

It seems the studio that did the reboot decided not to continue the Thief series, so can anyone recommend a game more like it than Uncharted? 

And this is not to say the Uncharted games aren't fun, they just don't fully scratch that itch!",5,1585678541,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fsi1w7/playing_the_uncharted_remastered_collection_made/,PS4,0

fshop1,imfromtoronto,PS4 Connection Issues? Packet Loss? Please Help,"Hello Reddit,

First time poster here and avid gamer.

I‚Äôm having some major issues playing games online on my PS4 right now. I‚Äôm playing Fortnite and COD:Warzone. 

I have a wired connection (directly to the modem, bypassing our router) via a relatively new and functioning cable. 

My download speed is usually between 100-350 mbps and upload speed is usually between 5-10 mbps. 

I have a type 1 (Open) NAT. 

Nobody else in my house has any issues with the internet. When I plug in my laptop into the cable I use for my ps4 internet connection, I get speeds of up to 450 mbps.

Nobody else out of my friends who live a few blocks away are dealing with any of these issues on the same games/same time as me despite having slower connections.

My issue is I seem to be constantly lagging and getting packet loss in-game on PS4. On fortnite I have packet losses every couple minutes of 26-55% and the wifi bars with the red X icon will immediately pop up. Simultaneously it will show that my ping is around 30ms. 

In COD:Warzone, I don‚Äôt ever see any packet loss, however the lag feels the same, and it shows my ping spiking from the 50-70 it usually hovers around, all the way to 120-200. 

I have tried: 

- Using the router
- Refreshing UPnP settings
- connecting directly to the Modem
- restarting the ps4 
- restarting the router
- playing with DNS settings (Default, Google, Cloudfare)


Does anyone have any suggestions/ideas or have experienced similar issues?",7,1585677409,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fshop1/ps4_connection_issues_packet_loss_please_help/,PS4,0

Now playing it all these years later the graphics have obviously tanked quite a bit. I mean it holds up impressively well, but it's not 'wowing' anymore, whatsover. 

That being, clunky controls, horrible mission design and a flat story, including many weirdly paced cutscenes, are exposed in broad daylight.

My question is for people who have tried both RDR2 and Death Stranding-is DS the same kind of game?

fsf69g,Alec1992,Really hoped for more Motorstorm,"  

Really wish Sony kept Evolution and Greenlight a Motorstorm for PS5 (or re-released them on PS4)

&amp;#x200B;

Still think Sony shot themselves in the foot for letting Evolution go ‚Äì Polypony Digital had the SIM driving nailed down at GT Sport has only got better since launch but now they don‚Äôt have any Arcade racers in their software line up to rival Forza Horizon 4 can‚Äôt see one of their 1st party studios doing a racing game. They should have kept Evolution to churn out those Arcade racers.

&amp;#x200B;

Original Motorstorm was my first game along with Resistance that I owned on my PS3 so it has a special place in my collection. It may have lacked split screen but online and single player was great. Such a fantastic launch title and at the time I was amazed by the graphics, the chaos, control and the mud. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then Pacific Rift came out and it seemed better in every way, it was easily one of the best Arcade racing games in recent memory I played that and its DLC to death and still from time to time plug my PS3 in to have a couple of races. I loved the Chaos and the track design was spectacular. The game is that good I still plug my PS3 in and play it every 4-5 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apocalypse was good as well, but I always preferred the first two it just didn‚Äôt scratch that same itch that the original or Pacific Rift had due to the lack of colours, vegetation, lava, mud and water. It didn‚Äôt control the same either. Was great driving through cities while buildings crumbled round you and earthquakes went off and twisters on the dock. Did always like the Golden gate bridge track.

&amp;#x200B;

Arctic Edge was one of my favourite PSP games as well ‚Äì I know Evolution didn‚Äôt make it, but it was still good

&amp;#x200B;

Driveclub to me is a great game and PS4 did need a driving game like it at the time but Gran Turismo will always be the bigger seller I would have preferred a Motorstorm ‚Äì It just got better overtime and I still pop it in from time to time. Sure, it was sloppy at launch but that to me feels like it was just because they seemed to run out of time and needed it on the shelves. After the up-dates it only went from strength to strength.   

&amp;#x200B;

I hope to God Sony greenlight another one for PS5 or quickly port them over to PS4 because it's a game series that the current line-up that Sony are missing.

&amp;#x200B;

They have the best Story telling games, they have games like Spiderman and Days Gone for open world, they have a Sim Racing and Driveclub, they have shooters, they have Ratchet and Platformers and have future Racer in Wipeout Omega collection etc. But they are missing an Arcade Racer which Motorstorm can fill.

&amp;#x200B;

Think about this for a minute, could you just imagine a ‚Äú**Motorstorm: Continental Drift**‚Äù with PS5 graphics. Racing on 6 Continents. 

¬∑ Tracks in the Desert, Flats, Canyons and Mud of Monument Valley (North America)

¬∑ Tracks on Lush tropical Islands with Jungles, Beaches, Rock Cliffs, Volcanos and Waterfalls just like Pacific Rift  (Oceania/Pacific) 

¬∑ Tracks in Open Grass Fields, Countryside, Cave, Tunnel  and Train Track Networks, Hills, Lakes, Farmlands, Woodlands and Snaking Tarmac of Yorkshire Dales/Moors, Derbyshire Peak District and Lake District in the UK (Europe - Rural Areas and Farmland)

¬∑ Tracks in the Savannahs and Safari of Ethiopia and Kenya (Africa - Open Plains)

¬∑ Tracks around The Peaks and Snow of Himalayas, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet and West China (Asia)

¬∑ And finally the Incan Ruins, Amazon Jungles and Mountains of Peru (SA)

&amp;#x200B;

I feel Motorstorm was best when it was tracks built with nature in mind, could add like 2-3 city tracks near an Town or Small rural town in the Peak District or something but mix nature and buildings or half Concrete leading into farm lands and open fields then circling back round. Sugar Rush track comes to mind for example was a nightmare but was such a riot to play on mixing the Sugar fields and abandoned factory. Pacific Rift will always take top spot for me. Heck you could even add an Open World like Forza Horizon with 6 different Medium sized maps with NPCs and Online Human characters in a lobby driving round so it feels like a large festival is taking place that separates the different race tracks to drive round and select events. But keep the race tracks sectioned off to keep them as race tracks not point to point ‚Äì You could just add single events into that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bikes, ATV, Buggy, Rally Cars, Racing Trucks, Mud Pluggers, Big Rigs and Monster Trucks return. Snow Mobile added back in for the Snow Levels and 1 NEW vehicle class that MUST be added and 2 maybes

&amp;#x200B;

**Must have Class**

¬∑ **HOVERCRAFT -** All Terrain Hovercraft are introduced and probably the LAST off-road vehicle class Motorstorm was missing - Unparalleled when it comes to the water and Ice ‚Äì Doesn‚Äôt get slowed down one bit and instead has better control in the water but tackles mud and all terrain with ease as well. Doesn't lose traction no matter what surface it is driving over even Ice.  So water, land, sand, mud, ice, snow, up beach etc the Hovercraft doesn't care what the Terrain is.

It has one glaring main Weakness which is it's bad Cornering Potential at top speeds because they are not agile. But they can Tackle Every Terrain with ease.

&amp;#x200B;

**Maybes**

¬∑ **4x4** \- (Range Rover / Jeep look alike) to bridge the gap between the Rally Cars / Buggy and Racing Truck and is another all-rounder like the racing truck. Good on and off road. But Mud Pluggers and Racing Trucks can bash them out of the way and handle way better in mud but 4x4 hold their own in mud but they handle better when on standard dirt track terrains than the Racing Truck and Mud Plugger would

&amp;#x200B;

¬∑ **MUSCLE CAR** \- Which excels at tops speeds in a straight line even more than the Rally Car, but even though modified it is absolutely shocking at turning and handling and needs to avoid mud and deep snows as much as possible as it can‚Äôt drift as well as the Rally Car or buggy as it‚Äôs more prone to spinning out with terrible traction. (Think Dukes of hazard or Starsky and Hutch etc The Dodge Charger was a Muscle Car and so was the Gran Torino not exactly used for off-road but they were in the TV Series and did various jumps and stunts)

&amp;#x200B;

You could even add some new race modes for single player events and splitscreen etc:

&amp;#x200B;

So have standard Race, Elimination and Speed Events but also could add the following.

TokenStorm - A token race quite like CTR and Diddy Kong racing there are 20 Motorstorm Helmet tokens hidden and you must at least collect 10 of them and place minimum third for 1 star, win for 2 stars or collect 15 and win for 3 stars.

ZoneStorm ‚Äì A single player time race to do 1-3 laps on a track. Go through different zones and rings to stop the clock for a certain time. Get a good time to get up to 3 stars.

TeamStorm ‚Äì Group up into teams of 4 and try to place as high as possible with your entire team. So, all pick different classes, Bike or Rally to try and get 1st while your big Rig hangs back and crashing into people.

BattleStorm ‚Äì A 3 lap race with 16 players ‚Äì Every lap when the players above the guys in the last 5 go over the line the last 5 people who are the back of the pack will keep boosting and then will blow up and they are out of the race and after 3 laps only 1 person will be left driving ‚Äì 16&gt;11&gt;6&gt;1.

StuntStorm ‚ÄìRace around the lap for points for around 4 minutes ‚Äì You get few points for every lap completed, you get a few for every 30 seconds you lead the pack, Big Air, Drifting, Boosting to achieve top Speed and steal/siphon point when you take Someone out grants more than laps and being in first would ‚Äì You lose points for every time you personally Crash or get points siphoned when you get taken out and you get less points when you hang too far back from the rest of the pack and top half to deter people from redoing the same jump over and over again. The person with the most points wins the race.

BoostStorm ‚Äì You don‚Äôt have a normal boost Gauge ‚Äì You obtain boost from collecting different coloured boost cans floating on the track trickier to obtain cans will yield more boost, getting Big air also grants some boost and causing other drivers to crash and you steadily gain boost being in the bottom half behind the top half of the pack.

MotorStorm ‚Äì World Event Races - A big Point to Point event race on the open World Maps. Use any vehicle and Go any Route you want to try and get to the point designated on the world map as fast as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Motorstorm was just so unique and chaotic and nothing is like it and I can‚Äôt find anything that will, It was my favourite arcade racer.

&amp;#x200B;

Or you know ‚Äì Codemasters get the guys that made Onrush to make a proper spiritual successor. They are the Racing/Car Game Developers after all.",25,1585669389,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fsf69g/really_hoped_for_more_motorstorm/,PS4,15

fscl7w,MainCranium,Problems installing PlayStation Store games (RESOLVED),"I wanted to share this in case someone else is banging their head against a wall with this same issue.

I recently purchased Spider-Man off the PlayStation store.  I was having trouble installing it.  Partway through the install it would fail.  Checking the notifications would show either a ""DNS Error"" or ""Corrupt Data"" message.  Resuming the download would fail a few times, but I could always get it to pick up where it left off after a few tries.  After it reached 51.45 GB downloaded, however, it would consistently throw the ""Data is Corrupted CE-36244-9"" message and would not resume no matter how many times I tried.  At first, I thought maybe PSN was having issues due to increased load due to the COVID-19 quarantine.  I followed Sony's troubleshooting guide and googled around a bit trying to see if anyone else was having this issue.

Steps I tried:

* Turning off DHCP and using a manual IP with a different public DNS server than I was previously using.
* Switching from WiFi to a wired connection.
* Cancelling and restating the download (Tried this SEVERAL times.  Same result every time.  51.45 GB downloaded: dies.)
* Copying my save data to a flash drive and doing a full initialization of my PS4.
* Installing *other* games I've purchased from the PlayStation Store (God of War, Dragon Age: Inquisition), no issues.

At this point I was reasonably confident that I didn't have any hardware problems on my end.  If that was the case, you would expect it to have issues installing any games, not just Spider-Man.

Right as I was going to bed it dawned on me that Sony might just have corrupted Spider-Man install data on the CDN (Content Delivery Network) server local to my area.  (I'm in Baltimore County, Maryland.)  For those unfamiliar, a CDN is a network of servers around the world designed to serve large amounts of data to users.  Windows Updates, Steam Games, Dell Drivers, all of these are downloaded from a CDN used by the company in question.  You are assigned to whatever CDN server you are closest to based on your IP address.

I'm fortunate that I already have a subscription to a VPN provider that would allow me to select from a large number of geographic locations to connect to.  Doing this allows you appear to be coming from a different IP address in a different geographic area from the perspective of the CDN.  I also have a NAS (Network Attached Storage) on my network that allows you to establish a VPN connection and allow devices on your local network to us it as a gateway to access the VPN tunnel without having a client installed locally.  So this morning, I created a VPN profile on my NAS that connects to California.  I then modified the network settings on my PS4 to use the NAS as the default gateway and voil√†, I'm passed the 51.45 GB barrier!  Rather than trust an install that had known corrupted contents, I killed my install and started over.  It took forever, as the VPN connection is not the fastest, but at least my problem is resolved.

Anyone who doesn't just happen to have a NAS capable of acting a VPN endpoint could achieve the same result by establishing the VPN connection on a PC / Mac and enabling Internet Connection Sharing (or the Mac equivalent) and setting the PS4 to use the computer as the default gateway.

I'll tweet about this to Sony, but I'm doubtful they'll take notice.

**TL;DR:**  Sony's server in the DC / Maryland area has corrupt install data for Spider-Man.  Got around it by using a VPN to the west coast.",0,1585660029,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fscl7w/problems_installing_playstation_store_games/,PS4,1

i wanted persona 5 royal physically but my carrier fucked me over (and the company i ordered from straight up lied to me 3 times about the delivery) so my physical copy is not coming on time at all

so i wanted to know if buying it digitally would be ""safe""

i'm always worried about buying games digitally since i don't have the physical media, so i was just wondering if other people got it digitally and if it's alright? I know that once downloaded i can play whenever indefinitely regardless if i'm connected so they can never take it away if it's downloaded, is this correct?

moving the ps4 and conecting it to a lan cable, it worked properly, removing the lan cable, i had up- and download available but really slow. now day 3 i still have these problems, which is freaking me out.

2. Vote for other games in the comments you'd like to see as well.

3. The top ~2-ish games will be given a game thread this week as well as one other game at random from the suggestions.

**Rules:**

1. One game per top-level comment.  It will otherwise be ignored.

2. The game must be released and available to play on PS4.  However, it doesn't matter how old it is.

3. Try to **avoid duplicates** as they tend to dilute the voting.  If the top two comments are the same game, it will still only get one thread for the week.

Normally, it's a space issue which isn't a problem but this time its a common error with an uncommon situation. I always pause all but one game depending on my priority of which one i want to play the most. However, when i turned on PS4 all three without missing a beat just said ""cannot download."" I retry and it either just tells me it can or it'll get like 20MB through then just STOP completely and say ""server has been lost."" I'll check my connections and have between 30-40Mb (yes i know the difference) of Down and about 15Mb of Up without faulter. 

I've tried just about everything:  
\- restart PS4  
\- unplug/plug in after 1 min  
\- restore licenses  
\- rebuild database  
\- sign out/in to PSN  
\- disconnect/reconnect wifi  
\- manually change MTU with values of either 1453 or 1473

fs4j7l,TSB223,"Hey guys! New to PS4 remote play and attempting to try for the first time. But ofc, ran into some trouble .","So, trying to connect my PS4 to my laptop so I can play through my laptop. 

I have an HP Omen Laptop and I have a PS4 Slim. 
I‚Äôm trying to connect and it was good in the beginning but after a while, the connection kept frequently dropping. 

On the PS website it‚Äôs stated that for Remote Play, ‚Äúa high-speed connection with upload and download speeds of at least 5 Mbps is required.‚Äù  I tested my connection on the PS4 and it was 5.8 Mbps for connections speed uploads and 43.1 Mbps for connection speed downloads. 

Very confused as to what‚Äôs happening here. I tried connecting the WIFI directly to my laptop, but it still gave about the same result. It just gradually got worse. It was almost perfect in the beginning except for the sound. The sound for some reason either never shows up or it does, but it cuts out quickly.

In the beginning, I was smoothly moving my PS4 to different applications and games with barely any lag. Any ideas? 

Should I connect the WIFI directly to the PS4 instead? 
I‚Äôm using the same WIFI for both the PS4 and the laptop so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs why as well? But from what I‚Äôve researched, it‚Äôd be weird if that‚Äôs the problem. As some people recommend that you put it on the same WIFI. I do have another WIFI to use but that depends if I should connect the WIFI directly to the PS4.

fs20wp,slajah,PS4/PS5 transfer process - Question,"Hello everyone! I am new to this community but figured it would be the best place to possibly get an answer or some feedback on a concern I have regarding the release of the long awaited PS5! I realize there isn't any real way to determine what the PS5 features or support will be like but maybe someone with more knowledge on PS consoles could possibly speculate and respond. I would like to address my concern which is that if transferring my data and games over to the PS5. Why this is a concern is because I plan on trading in my PS4 Pro and paying the difference to get the PS5.

Ok so there's a lot going on in my head. First of all I'm not sure GameStop or any other electronic stores do a trade in on pre orders. I assume I would have to wait to see the promotions that they offer on pre orders. Have they let the community trade in the old PS systems in the past for a discount on their pre ordered console? I'm not sure if this is a reality or not. I am hoping there is an option online when you pre order to trade in the console.

If it isn't a reality I'm assuming the only way to get a PS5 will be to pre order it. What I mean is I feel like the consoles stores will receive to sell will not just be on shelves and will typically be sold out due to the massive amount of pre orders that is a part of every console launch. If I cannot trade it in when pre ordering I will obviously just have to pay full price.

Now my next question is that if I can trade in my PS4 Pro for a discount on the PS5 will I be able to store all my save data and games with any sort of CLOUD storage that PS offers or will I have to physically buy an external drive, transfer all of my data onto it, then transfer it onto the PS5 after purchase? If I am able to trade in my PS4 I would obviously need a way to transfer everything.

Thank you whoever took the time to read this. If you have any confusion or concern about anything I said feel free to ask me and I will try to clarify.",2,1585611782,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fs20wp/ps4ps5_transfer_process_question/,PS4,1

fs12ie,Miniteshi,Horizon Zero Dawn - I'm gonna say it,"Best game I've played, ever.

I've been play games since the 80s and OK in those days, a game was more just something brand new so always had a wow factor. Fast forward 3 decades and we are in an era where we are quite meh about everything.

So fast forward to the launch of the PS1, Final Fantasy 7 launched, slowly ended up being available on PC which was my first real venture into RPG's and yeah at that time I was still a kid so didn't get the concept etc.moving on, I grew to understand how the games work and how the stories flowed. Final Fantasy 7 followed by 10 had by far the more emotional story lines I had ever enjoyed. The imprint left behind was immeasurable.

Now on a whim, I grabbed a trial of PS Now and got a chance at HZD and I'm going to have to reshuffle my entire memory. The sheer depth, I mean a whole new level of depth this game bought to my senses has been insane. The Last of Us, Heavy Rain etc were all good and memorable but meh sort of memorable. I mean I'd do a play through but once and once only.

After picking up the gameplay, I sat and watched the game evolve. The characters, the story, THE MUSIC!, the opponents, the voice cast, the acting and the emotion, it was heart melting. Never and I mean NEVER have I played such an evocative game in my entire live. God that sound track just took an entire dump on everything else I've ever played and that's the die hard Final Fantasy fan boy in me talking!

It was so pure I played pretty much through the night twice only managing a few hours of sleep, shattered but so elated I played through from start to finish. The experiences you encounter through the story and additional sections is just special.

If I had any gripes, it was load times were a pain but for what it gives you and which is does in spades, its a insignificant gripe to have.

You can keep your Gran Turismo Sport, Call of Duty Modern Warefare 20 and your God of Wars, I'll look out to the Horizon.

So to everyone to made the game possible, you have one heartwarmed fan. You truly made my 2020 that but more special.",16,1585608289,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fs12ie/horizon_zero_dawn_im_gonna_say_it/,PS4,1

Hey!  


My name is Colin Moriarty, writer and co-producer of Twin Breaker: A Sacred Symbols Adventure, which recently came to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. It's a story-driven brick-breaker in the spirit of Breakout, Arkanoid, and the like, with a sci-fi plot that we hope adds texture to the experience.  


I'll be joined here by Barry Johnson of Lillymo Games, who designed the game, programmed it, etc. It is through our collaboration that Twin Breaker was born!  


The game is available as a cross-buy title for $9.99 (or your local equivalent) if you're interested in checking it out:  [https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4836-CUSA18309\_00-TWINBREAKERONPS4](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4836-CUSA18309_00-TWINBREAKERONPS4)  


You can see the game's launch trailer here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PulISiOMf-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PulISiOMf-c)   


So... AMA!

fryu2p,spriteleftatarbys,PS4 is too hot error,"Hello all, I'm sure there's an obvious answer to this but realistically I'm not sure what would be the best move. So a couple weeks ago my ps4 gave me an error that told me the ps4 was too hot and it shut off, I looked up stuff for it and it mainly said to clean the fan and I've done that before so I went out bought some compressed air and cleaned it from the inside, it was fine for a week. But now it just gives me the error message much more fast and I usually see it with high end games like Monster Hunter Worlds or Call of Duty warzone. I play games like final fantasy xiv and it doesn't get the error message until i start doing new content. Thing is when i touch my ps4 it isn't hot at all, both bottom and top; it's like the usual console heat that you get. My theory is that the fan may be failing and the ps4 detects that it can't keep up or something so it shuts off so just in cast it doesn't get fried. My question is if anyone has experienced this could tell me if its a smart move to go out and get it repaired because i lack the skill to repair it myself, or would it just prolong the inevitable and just to suck it up and buy a new one.

thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

I use google WiFi router and the provided modem from Spectrum.

So last night I took my external hdd that my games were on and plugged it into my win 10 laptop to copy my mp3s over. Long story short, my computer didn‚Äôt recognize the drive. I used the disk management application to see why and i could see it there, but it was showing as unformatted so at that point I didn‚Äôt want to format it and lose all of my ps4 files on it so I disconnected it.   
I plugged it back into my ps4 and now my ps4 is showing it as unformatted too.

fru6yc,JaedenRuiner,DVD Upscaling Configuration,"Okay,

So, i know that systems claim to ""upscale"" but i'm curious as to the configuration process because this doesn't really seem to work as expected.

Any DVD that is encoded in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, doesn't upscale on my PS4 Pro.  Or at least, doesn't upscale well.

If i set the playback in the settings while playing the DVD to ""normal"" the movie appears as a small screen within the full size of my tv, so i get black boards around all 4 sides.  Basically it's playing a centered 720p window on a 1080p screen.

When i set it to ""zoom"" it expands out, but the subtitles are clipped at the bottom.  If i use ""Full"", it seems to stretch the video horizontally, and the movie doesn't quite look right.

I have plenty of movies on bluray that are in the wider aspect ratio (2.35:1 not 16:9 which is the aspect ratio of a 1080p screen), and they play just fine with the expected boarders at the top and bottom, but for some reason the PS4 won't ""work the math"" to make a DVD in this aspect ratio to upscale decently.   My old Philips DVD player, upscaled moves just fine.  However, in both the Philips DVD player, and my old PS3 there was a section on how the device should handle upscaling of DVD to HD TVs in the configuration.  I have found no such area in the PS4 settings.

Is this just one of those things, where the device isn't recognizing the encoding, or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks

I have recently purchased a PS4 slim console off local marketplace, which clearly turned out to be a scam (user deleted account). The guy that sold me the console has booted it in front of me, but apparently did not have a controller, so I was fine seeing the console boot up itself to the ‚Äòconnect the controller‚Äô screen. The console does not sync with a controller (neither v1 or v2). The controller just flashes white when connected to the USB and turns off, as if it doesn‚Äôt want to find connection at all. The USB ports charge the controllers, as well as other devices just fine as well. The connection also doesn‚Äôt work when booted in safe mode. I have tried everything I found on the internet so far (share+ps button reset, reset pin, connected like 15 different cables, including the original ps cable). I also tried 3 different controllers, one of which i literally took out of the original box 20 minutes ago, and I have reinstalled the firmware from scratch from the PS website, which suggests it is definitely a hardware issue. I suspect either a faulty bluetooth antenna, or its module chip, but I am not a techie. Any suggestions before I start messaging some repair services?

frrytr,ethman14,Region Locked Downloads?,"So I was troubleshooting a problem with my PS4, for some time now sometimes when I turn it on, it says it cannot start and needs to reinitialize. So I go through all the rigamarole to make that happen and eventually get back into my PS4, log into my PS+ account and have to redownload games. This happened once in December, again last month, and then twice in the last week.

So after checking pretty much all my options and seeing similar stories it kinda looks like I'm screwed for this console. It's a North American PS4 and I live in China. I do not have the tools to dissect and fix the hard drive (assuming it's a hard drive problem), and it's not getting shipped anywhere anytime soon. So here's the actual question I'm facing:

90% of my games are downloaded from PSN to my North American PSN account. If I bought a replacement here, say like a Slim or Pro that was a China region PS4, would I still be able to log in using my North American PSN account? Even then, would I be able to download the games I had bought before, or would they all be locked since I had originally bought and downloaded them on a North American console? Is there a way to check which games would be locked in China? 

I can shell the money for another PS4, but not to replace the entire library of games I had... Has anyone ever tried downloading their library onto another PS4 from another region?",4,1585579166,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/frrytr/region_locked_downloads/,PS4,1

I hope they can reboot the franchise or even just hire a studio to remaster the trilogy with maybe a collective multiplayer.

Friday night while playing MW on my PS4 slim for the first time in at least a year, things started to get super laggy, so i decided to reboot my PS4 to see if it was my network or clear out some of the virtual dust.  This did not improve things, but actually froze my PS4 entirely. I ended up pulling the power plug while frozen, I know stupid thing to do, but it was midnight and I was annoyed and just wanted to go to bed at that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I came back to it on Sunday (Yesterday) I got the usual system check process, and then was told my PlayStation could not start and to download the latest firmware online and reinitialize. I downloaded the PS4UPDATE.PUP (originally downloads as PS4REINSTALL702.PUP), put it on a trusty flash drive in the right folders (PS4 &gt; UPDATE &gt; .pup file) and plugged it in. PS4 started in safe mode, warns me all my data is going to be erased and i resign my fate. This fills to 99% and then gives me the error; ""Cannot access system storage CE-33570-8"". I google my ass off and find a couple of trouble shooting tips such as re-seating the HDD, which doesn't change anything. Next; Pull the hard-drive and run ChkDsk on it. I try this but it runs for 4 hours and then gives me an error about the MFT (Sorry I don't have the exact error anymore), basically saying the master file table or something is corrupted? not sure.  I use diskpart to clean the disk, and re-insert into the PlayStation. I download a NEW .pup file, and grab a NEW flash drive just in case, give it a go again. Now i'm getting an error of ""Cannot initialize CE-33566-3)""

Any other ideas or did my 2TB drive fail? How screwed am I?",0,1585576492,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/frr7s9/support_request_ps4_wont_reinitialize_after_power/,PS4,1

I don't want to whine and sound like a snowflake, but I need a piece of advice on my problem.

I was a PC user for almost my entire life, but about two years ago I switched to PS4 Pro, because I couldn't offer a laptop which could give me a decent PC experience (high FPS mainly). Also, I wanted to play PS4 exclusives.

I really enjoy my PlayStation experience except playing FPS or TPS. I do suck, because I cannot aim properly on (with?) DualShock 4.

Again, I don't want to sound like a crybaby, but my aim is terrible. I improved it, because I played with gamepads for quite some time, but still my K/D ratio isn't that good and, actually, overall experience suffers, because of my aim, not I'm a bad player or something like that.

I don't know what to do: I cannot offer a good laptop (I need a laptop, not PC, because of mobility; still I cannot offer a PC too lol) and I don't have enough money to buy adapters and keyboard and mouse to connect to PS4.

My K/D ratio in Titanfall 2 is above 1, but I feel mostly it's because of random and some tactical and strategy management, not pure aim skills.

I guess it's worth to mention that I'm a hardcore gamer, I do play not only for fun, but competition. I suffer from tilting and rage quiting, however I'm (trying) to hold myself in hand. Anyway, it is really difficult to maintain your own mental condition. Outside is cool, but inside is boiling.

I guess I just want some support, because the most accessible tip I can get is to improve my aim. It's not a big problem, I know, but I do like games, especially shooters and it is really sad when you cannot enjoy what you like to do.",7,1585573106,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/frqbno/cannot_play_shooters_on_dualshock_4/,PS4,1

frq373,RonniebonYT,I can't play GTA V,"A few months ago, I saw GTA V was on Playstation Now in the UK, so I decided to buy PSNow.  
I played it for a while, then I got kinda bored and canceled the subscription. Yesterday, I bought a new PSNow Subscription expecting to play the game. But there was a lock next to it. I had just bought the Psnow subscription but it said something along the lines of ""Playstation Now License cannot be confirmed""  
I had bought the subscription so why?  
It asked if I wanted to go to the Playstation store to buy it, but it said I already had it, which was correct.  
I went to the game page to try and buy it instead, but that few months ago, I had bought a DLC for GTA V, so I couldn't buy the game.  


I've thought of possibly getting a GTA V redeemable code to see if I can obtain the game that way but I'm not sure about it, any suggestions?

froacg,omcpero,How to get NAT type 1 or 2 on PlayStation 4/PS4 via LTE UMTS Router,"Hope I spare some hours of playing around with your LTE/UMTS router and NAT horror stories.

&amp;#x200B;

I will first go through ways you will not obtain NAT 1/2, these settings will not work (does not matter if you use Wifi or LAN on your PS4):

* Port Forwarding (also called ""Virtual Server"") will not work (\*reason below)
* Special Applications setting will not work (\*reason below)
* setting up static IP manually on PS will not work (\*reason below)
* Putting PS4 IP as your DMZ setting on the router 

\*reason: Your ISP (mobile network provider) has set NAT on your external IP, meaning your ISP will dynamically set your IP (every network session restart this IP changes)

The only way you will obtain NAT 2 permanently on UMTS router (as Huawei or many others) is:

Contact your ISP, request for a **static public IP**, there is no other chance, believe me!

&amp;#x200B;

You can play around if you want to, I have lost hours trying to figure this out. Occasionally I did get NAT type 2 on my PS4, but only for a minute or two.

&amp;#x200B;

If you still have problems (shown NAT type 3 on your PS4) after your ISP sets static public IP for you, try can the following steps:

* Disable firewall on your LTE/UMTS router (not all routers have this setting enabled)

[Disable firewall on your LTE\/UMTS router \(not all routers have this setting enabled\)](https://preview.redd.it/o6ryypxpasp41.png?width=1128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c750386cb8551c919dfe82efe5fbd0218664d67)

* Put your PS4 IP (something list 192.168.\*.\*) to DMZ on your LTE/UMTS router

[Put your PS4 IP \(something list 192.168.\*.\*\) to DMZ on your LTE\/UMTS router](https://preview.redd.it/dm5uiz3vasp41.png?width=1128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b960512fa9642fc6f59fd5bef3fe62ff06157a)

* Set up port forwarding (sometimes called Virtual Server) for the next TCP/UDP ports:
   *  TCP: 80, 443, 1935, 3478-3480
   *  UDP: 3478-3479
   * try avoiding the TCP/UDP setting, write one rule for TCP, the other for UDP
   * check image below, many of my ports are forwarded specifically for some games (Destiny 2, Far Cry 4, ...)

[Set up port forwarding \(sometimes called Virtual Server\) for the next TCP\/UDP ports:](https://preview.redd.it/5t03ms63bsp41.png?width=1128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bc1762f54792d2ba984cba1a7fa80660196e428)

* Set up Special Application settings (if you have this setting, many routers do not)

[Set up Special Application settings](https://preview.redd.it/4a1cbjprbsp41.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c1b6688443b06f4f5c8adb518e76ab1e69d2e73)

**General remarks:**

* Many of these settings might not be available to set on your router (they are firmware locked/hidden)
* Do not try any custom ROM you find on the internet, most will not work, the one that do will, will usually break something
* None of the following settings will most likely change anything for you
   * ""Bridge Mode"" (best turned off), 
   * ""NAT (Cone setting is best)"", 
   * ""UPNP (Disabled is best)""
   * &amp;#x200B;
* Let me repeat, the only way you will obtain NAT 2 permanently on UMTS/LTE router is contacting your ISP, request for a static public IP, there is zero chance you can get NAT 1 or NAT 2 setting before you do so.

frnut0,Skelatorfmk,(Tech support) PS4 Overheating and shutting off.,"The Tech support sub was kind of dead so I thought I'd ask in here for some help. 

My Sony was playing and being ridiculously loud. So I took it apart and cleaned it with a dry wrag and some cotton ear buds and put it back together perfectly, fan was crystal clean and span smoothly with no problems. But once I plugged it back in it started sounding a jet engine within thirty seconds and shuts off immediately displaying a ""ps4 is too hot"" message. 

I've taken it apart again and checked all cables, fan, screws, dust blockages etc 
And everything seems fine. The only issue I can see is the, what I think are thermal pads on top of the grey plate covering the motherboard looking a little haggard?

I just bought GT Sport, 45gb in size, can't download because I need more space. Why?

It doesn't need to backup a previous installation, it's not an update, it's a fresh download!

And I have double the amount of the size of the game!

I have only 3 other games installed: FIFA, Fortnite and COD.

Should I give up and delete COD or are there other solutions? At least someone explain me why it's not downloading.

Consoles I do own:
I have a xbox one, but was not a super big fan of it (plus even if I wanted to play it my brother uses it almost 24/7)

I have a ps3 which I had enjoyed very much when I was younger, playing alot of Tokyo jungle and little big planet 2 (I love these games, but will probably not return to them)

Biggest of all i have a strong pc with a vr headset, so the ps4 is not to play vr. My pc is great and I love it very much.

The reason im thinking about a ps4 is because lately I have been feeling kinda lonely. My friends who play pc with me have been offline alot lately and a good few of my friends play on ps4. Some of this decision will weigh on if my friends will play with me, but I want to hear from you guys if I should get a ps4.

I was thinking a ps4 slim, and if I do get one also would like some game suggestions.

Games I like-
Little big planet 2
Tokyo jungle
Natural selection 2
Call of duty modern warfare
Doom eternal
Ark survival evolved
The isle

So if you can help me decide on id I should get the console that will be amazing, as well as some game recommendations.

The main reason I am iffy on the ps4 is because I have a pc and thinking of getting a playstation makes me feel guilty for some reason. I'm worried I will like it for a bit then drift back to my pc, but with quarantine keeping me at home I do need something to do.

frkljh,caralhation,Ds4 controller going nuts,"Hey everyone!


I purchased this ds4 controller about 5 months ago, and since the beginning the controller always had some kind of stick drift. 


 Since the drift was so little, I resorted to increasing  the dead zone. It was a bit annoying but livable.


However, about a month ago the controller went bat shit crazy. Every time I moved in one direction, whichever it was, suddenly the controller pointed up with the force of Zeus. 

I always treated it with care and never used it very often. 

Besides this happening on games, it was almost impossible to use the ps4 menu due to the constant upwards motion. 


I decided to test the controller on ds4 windows and on windows controller settings. Lo and behold, this bad boy doesn't disappoint. 


Does anyone else have this issue? 

I'm going to claim the warranty on this caralho.",2,1585544300,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/frkljh/ds4_controller_going_nuts/,PS4,1

Ever since two days ago my PlayStation 4 (Model 1215A) has been acting up. It‚Äôs about 4-5 years old and this is the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced problems like this.

At first I couldn‚Äôt load into my Rainbow game. This happened multiple times. Then the whole system crashed saying that theirs corrupted data. I‚Äôve rebuilt the data base multiple times and reinstalled the system software as well(via USB). The problems still persist. 

The console will randomly shut off(error codes) and all my games are really buggy. It has very long boot times and even fails to boot at all sometimes. Whenever it crashes it boots me into safe mood (if it even boots). I can only guess it‚Äôs my hard drive finally kicking the bucket so should I get a new one?

I'm only playing the single-player campaign of Doom Eternal, don't really go in for online stuff, but it seems I don't have a choice in creating this account. I can't even start the game without it, unless I disconnect the console from the internet first. I can't find any solid description of what this account is for exactly, save for ""certain progression and Bethesda/Steam cross-play"" - is it also trophies, character skins, bragging rights etc.? In either of these cases this shouldn't be relevant to me.

I also don't understand what ""linking"" accounts does exactly, does this mean Bethesda can see the PSN account data? Am I supposed to have one Bethesda account per Bethesda game?

The latest *Modern Warfare* 2019 campaign is stuck at ""Install suspended"" since the first moment. Warfare and Multiplayer are working though. Please see video.

* Delete MW2 (ca. 150GB)
* Delete MW2 and all add-ons
* Reinstall the above

When I click ""X"", it won't ""Install"" anything, it just shows me an overview of what's installed. See video.

Recently I've come across a problem with my PS4. Sometimes whilst I am randomly playing the video disappears as if it is off. But the PlayStation is working it seems and the joystick is working fine too as it continues to vibrate during the game. 

Sometimes it turns on and cuts the video off after a while. And sometimes it just doesn't show any video at all. 

Another peculiar thing is that when I turn on the ps4 and it gives me an error network even though the internet is working fine on it. 

I have tried changing the HDMI cable, I have tried changing the port on the TV from hdmi 2 to hdmi 1 etc. 

Nothing seems to work. What does seem to help isnif I put the PlayStation on a certain side or give it a slap from time to time.

Now I get a flashing blue light, error codes that say ""cannot start the ps4. cannot access the system storage"" and it's rare that I even make it into safe mode.

As of right now, I'm trying to rebuild the database, but all I'm getting is that pulsating blue light with no display (the display is on, just a black screen)

Here's what I've already tried;

Quick Initialize without installing system software

Initialize with system software

Unplugged it overnight, tried new outlet and new HDMI cable

Popped out the hard drive and put it back in

Rebuild database just takes me to the black screen

frapwb,Jacques_Plantir,Question: Topping off MP servers with AI players.,"Hi all,  

I've been playing more online MP games recently, and the thought just came to mind -- when a game's player base is declining, and the devs want to keep queue times low, one solution could be to privately start inserting 20 or 25% AI players into each match. I feel like at that percentage, players might not notice it.  

To be clear, I think this would be kind of lame, and I wouldn't be for it. I also have no particular game/s in mind in suggesting this. I was just curious if there have been known cases where companies did this, and it came to light?",2,1585506968,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/frapwb/question_topping_off_mp_servers_with_ai_players/,PS4,0

And the problem with that is that I currently play on my mobile hotspot (which gives me 30gb of data a month) which is enough to play on a daily basis but not enough to download this update and then continue to play.

fra3rj,peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepoo,Controllers disconnecting and drifting,"Hello!
First post on Reddit, I need some help with my 2 PS4 controllers.

So I have 2 controllers and one is probably about 2 years older than the other, but within the space of a few days (a couple of weeks back) the light at the front of both controllers went red regardless of the charge they were on, and they keep randomly disconnecting and drifting and it's getting worse the more I use them. At first they were a lot better when I plugged them in to charge to play, but now it doesn't make a difference.

I've tried vacuuming the dust out of the control sticks, cleaning them with a q tip and a clean paintbrush, blowing the dust, cleaning the controller and hard resetting each one. Nothing.

It's driving my brother and I round the bend, help a girl out will ya?? Thank you ü§†",1,1585504811,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fra3rj/controllers_disconnecting_and_drifting/,PS4,0

fr9zeg,DampestHotDog,I cannot deactivate a mystery Primary PS4 and I don‚Äôt know what to do.,"As the title says, there is a mystery ps4 that my account is primary on. I have two ps4s, neither of which actually have my account as primary, despite the website saying a ps4 is primary. 

I have tried activating manually on both systems I own, just to be told another system is already primary. 

I have tried deactivating remotely from the website, just to be hit with the message that it can only be done every 6 months. 

I can‚Äôt contact Sony, I‚Äôve tried calling and I believe due to COVID-19 their phones are closed because it says they are unavailable and that is it. 

I am completely unsure of what to do, I had an issue where a random game was purchased not too long ago so I contacted Sony to cancel because I didn‚Äôt make the purchase and proceeded to change my password and everything to make sure nothing happens. Now I am experiencing this where my account is primary somewhere, just not on my systems despite changing my password and enabling 2-step verification. 

I have no idea what to do, this is essentially a cry for help cause I‚Äôve tried to contact Sony via chat and phone to no avail and can‚Äôt fix the problem myself. I feel like someone somehow has my account despite me changing all my information. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",4,1585504390,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fr9zeg/i_cannot_deactivate_a_mystery_primary_ps4_and_i/,PS4,0

fr9l63,TheDoctorDanko,USB Charging Station,"I‚Äôve been researching Charging Stations for sometime and the reviews on them are so scattered that I am nervous I‚Äôm going to destroy my peripherals. So the idea is to make one to accommodate all my stuff. 

As of now, the plan is to house the VR Headset on top and then be able to charge two PS3 move controllers (because they work with the PS4), a PS4 Headset, and a single PS4 controller. 

The thing I keep bumping up against is this software ‚Äòhandshake‚Äô that prevents me from just charging my move controllers through a wall adapter. 

I have a Motorola micro usb wall charger that lets me charge my headset and my PS4 controller, but because the PS3 move controllers use a mini usb it adds that extra step I‚Äôm trying to circumvent. So far I haven‚Äôt found a wall charger that can work around that supposed ‚Äòhandshake‚Äô it needs to charge. I‚Äôve read the work around is to get a mini USB adapter that can handle the data and power connection in order to charge it. (Is there any truth to that?)

So for now I‚Äôm basically hunting for a simple usb hub (for up to 4 devices) that can work with any PS device. Additionally, I‚Äôd like it to use an AC adapter for power so that I can plug into the wall. That way I can have the charging station in a separate part of the room and not have it shackled next to the PS4. 

Tl;dr: Does anyone have any suggestions on what USB hubs could work with charging PS3/ps4 devices? Or do I just have to risk all my gear with a charging station?",4,1585502984,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fr9l63/usb_charging_station/,PS4,0

fr8vpw,CosmosDucklingRocker,PS4 not responding,"Hello! 

As you might have guessed from the title my PS4 unit is completely unresponsive and as of now I'm clueless what to do. I'll try to give you the best possible description of the occuring problem.

So, about 4 years ago I got a ps4, didn't really use it all that much and after about 3 months of using it off and on I decided to put it back to its package and maybe use it when I get more money and find some free time. Since the whole corona situation is going on right now I decided there wouldn't be a more perfect time for losing myself in some action packed game or just chilling out playing Stardew. Besides, I could finally catch up with 4 years of video game abstinence.

Finally, my time has come. I unpack my ps4, dust it off and plug everything in. My excitement is at its peak as I'm about to press the power button. I press the button and nothing happens. I then basically spammed it and held it, desperately trying to turn it on, nothing seemed to work. I figured the power button is dead so a 200 IQ idea hits my brain and I decided to put a disc into it hoping that the PS would turn on that way. To my surprise it did. My fortune wasn't long lasting though. The instruction telling me to press the PS button on my controller pops up. Again the same thing happens. I press the PS button, the PS is not responding, I spam it and hold it. Nothing works. Panic has really gotten into me now, I didn't know what to do so I decided to Google it. I tried quite a few things. I tried holding the power button, holding the PS button on my controller, I tried adjusting cables, changing micro USB cable on my controller. I restarted my conrtoller, even opened up the PS. Nothing worked. 

Just as I said, I am clueless. I tried literally everything that I read on the goddamn interwebs. I reckon that hardware is fucked up for some reason.   
Also, I'm sorry for writing a lengthy essay instead of a concise description of my problem. But I guess there isn't much to say except that it's completely ignoring any type of input. For those wondering, the PS4 light is coloured white and it's not pulsating and the controler light is coloured orange and it is pulsating.

fr8kp8,strikebacknoww,PS Store Turkey removes all sales with the first case of coronavirus.,"Hello guys.


PS Store of Turkey removed all discounts since the first coronavirus case in Turkey. Normally, our store follows the UK‚Äôs store. But no more. Since everyone is stuck at home and trying to pass time, Turkish PS Store must have thought it‚Äôd make more money? This is a real dick move. 
Normally we would have a section in the store, I think its name was Deals or sth where we could see the discounts. They removed that section completely and bumped up the prices. 
The other countries‚Äô stores continue with the sale, but not us. I was playing the free AC Odyssey last weekend and it said in the main screen that I can buy it 65% off, I clicked on it and voila: it doesn‚Äôt exist.

- I want to share my games with my brother.

- I've deactivated my PS4 as primary.

- He has activated his own PS4 as primary with my account.

- He can download and play my games through my account.

Now how can we play offline games at the same time ? We're trying to play the same game at the same time (separately, not together) but we get disconnected since we're on the same account. And if I sign out from my account, I'm automatically asked to log in again, otherwise I can't play.

If he uses his own account to play the game, he gets a message that reads that only some users (me) can play the game and that if he wants to access the content of the game he has to buy it.

fr80ol,MAD_DOG86,Question about upgrading PS4 with SSD,"I would like to upgrade my PS4 with an SSD. I've read reviews with some saying it does not help the original PS4 much, and others saying they've noticed a speed increase. The main problem I have is with the loading time in games (right now having it with Metro Exodus but also in games like The Witcher 3), so would a SSD help with with this issue, and should I do it?

I also read different recommendations for SSDs of SSHD, so I am wondering if I did upgrade which one would be better. 

I currently have a 4TB external HDD connected to my PS4, and original 500GB internal HDD. I just copy the games I'm currently playing to the PS4, so a large SSD is not really necessary. 

I am planning on getting a PS5 near release, but I figured I could remove the SSD and put it in a case to use as an external. Thanks for the help

Thinking about getting back into gaming for the first time in years.,"So I havent had any Sony console since my PS3 broke years ago. But in these times where I need to occupy and distract myself, I was thinking of getting my first PS4.

I had a bunch of classic hockey, baseball , wrestling games etc that I loved in the PS1 and PS2. I looked at the playstation store and only saw select PS2 games available for purchase and not surprisingly none of my old games were on that list.

Is there a way to download any old PS1 and PS2 game on the PS4? I'd be willing to pay if necessary. 

Also, can you download any PS4 game from the store? 

I'm sure this question has been asked before but I'm so out of the loop when it comes to gaming...any help is appreciated.

fr6it9,joelkelevra90,Stuck In Safe Mode Loop," 

So a couple of days ago my PS4 kept on booting in safe mode. I watched a ton of YouTube videos on fixes and tried every option in safe mode. All the 7 options and it doesn't seem to work.

When I tried the 7th option, I formatted the USB in exfat (tried it in FAT32 too), downloaded the ps4 update file (1.1gb one), created a PS4 folder, added an ""UPDATE"" folder, I pasted that file in there and I started with option 7. Initialize system software (the reinstall one). After going through with that it gave me an error SU-41343-5 in which it said ""Cannot use this USB storage device. The PS4 does not support this file system. To use it with this format, you must format it to exFAT, go to settings, device, USB storage device and select format as exFAT... SU-41343-5"" Now the problem is I've already formatted it into exFAT format and it's asking me again to do that. (So I can't even install a fresh system software)

The only option that has seemed to work is if I go for option 6 which is initialize software and that works for a little bit of time, it takes me to the main screen and everything seems to work fine, I can download games, sign-in on my ps4 account and everything but after one restart I'm stuck in the same loop. It boots up in safe mode and I'm again left with the same options.

Can anyone please help me out with this, been stuck with this for almost 8 days now.

fr68ay,comedybingbong21,LAN Cable connection,"I recently returned to playing online after a long hiatus (3 kids, no close friends to play with on PS4, life, etc.) so that I can play COD Warzone with some friends on PC. I have AT&amp;T 100 fiber for internet so I assumed my WiFi connection would be fine. Turns out even though I‚Äôm 1 floor down and really only about 10 feet from the router, my PS4 would drop the connection constantly while playing Warzone. My non technical guess is just because so many devices in my house are connected to the router wirelessly (various phones, tablets, smart TVs) that it just can‚Äôt hold the connection.  I was able to use a WiFi extender this to already have for upstairs to remain connected but sacrificed so much speed that it was definitely affecting my gameplay experience. 

Anyway on to my actual question. With the help of a friend who works in networking; we were able to wire Ethernet through an existing hole outside and down to the basement. He attached Ethernet connectors to a standard wire (way over my head) and it worked.  Set up my connection on the PS4 with the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù settings and boom I was back online and the speed was great. I could instantly see a difference. Problem is next time I turned the PS4 on, it wouldn‚Äôt connect. I unplugged from the router and plugged back in, set it up again and it was fine. Problem is, I have to do this EVERY time I turn my PS4 on. 

So far, I haven‚Äôt had any luck googling this issue so I was hoping to find an answer here. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",3,1585490160,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fr68ay/lan_cable_connection/,PS4,1

fr55qr,Liquidest_Ocelot,Using the pandemic to replay Bioshock Series,"So this post is basically what the title says. With all that's been going on, I've taken the time to play through the Bioshock Remaster Trilogy we got on PS Plus last month.

It'd been about 10 years since i played the first game, and i fell back in love with it straight away and somehow i had forgotten about the amazing soundtrack! It promptly got added to my Spotify. Even though i remembered the twist, there was so many things i had forgotten. Especially the creepy and tense moments that Sander Cohen bring to the table, i remember as a teen, playing through it for the first time, being so on edge in the sections.

Then i moved onto Bioshock 2, (obviously) this one i hadn't played before, so i went in with limited knowledge of the story, and i find it a but underwhelming compared to the first game. Gameplay was quite repetitive, and they had too many escort missions in the guise of Little Sisters harvesting for my liking. Story was alright, nothing special, no big twist, and whilst i enjoyed it, i didn't love it.

And today, i imagine i will start Bioshock Infinite. Ive played it before a few years ago, and i remember it being a solid game and addition to the franchise.

Lets take our minds off what's going on out there, and get lost in the world of games.

fr51xm,Sugar-Dog-69,Top 5 most overrated games that are not worth buying despite people trying to convince you to buy them,"**(1) Horizon Zero Dawn**

Cavemen vs Robots is an inherently bad idea. The entire world they made up for this game is not remotely interesting and is just too goofy to care about. The gameplay is boring and it's basically a half baked 3rd person shooter with shitty stealth 


**(2) Spider-Man**

The web swinging mechanics are awesome, I will give it that. However the swinging gets old about 4 or 5 hours into the game and then everything else is a slog. Everything about the game is just corny and mind-numbing, the combat sucks, and there is hardly any enemy variety. Only get this game if you are a huge fan of Marvel and superheroes and all that crap


**(3) God of War**

Great aesthetics, shitty gameplay; poorly designed levelling and upgrade system, lackluster boss fights, forgettable enemies. Also, the story is dumb and the kid is annoying. 


**(4) Fortnite**

I mean it's a free game so technically you don't have to buy it, but it's a waste of storage space and a waste of time to play. Gameplay is boring, cartoony theme and graphics make it hard to play for more than 10 minutes at a time, clunky ass combat, over half the people playing it aren't even drinking age 


**(5) The Witcher 3**

Generic Tolkien-wannabe fantasy setting and theme.  Boring characters, clunky combat, annoying crafting and inventory system.  Becomes way too easy once you get to around level 10.

fr4odk,Somobro,I really hope the next God Of War does bosses better,"I know this isn't exactly a hot take, but I'm replaying the GoW3 remaster and it's reminding me just how well this series did boss battles. 


While GoW4 had the Valkyries, which were amazing, I can only think of 3 fights in the entire game which feel like they're not well below the curve for the rest of the series. The first two games and side games aside, 3 alone blows GoW4 completely out of the water for boss diversity and spectacle. I know that fighting top tier Olympians is a whole different ball game but going through Poseidon, Hades, Hermes, Hercules, the Scorpion, Kronos, and Zeus feels amazing, whereas aside from &gt;!Baldr!&lt;, and &gt;!Magni/Modi!&lt; the story boss fights in the sequel felt a bit boring. 


Taking into account 1/2, the series is possibly at its weakest point when it comes to boss battles with GoW4, which is a shame because it's at its pinnacle with everything else. 


Any ideas on how the next game can improve on this?",8,1585482274,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fr4odk/i_really_hope_the_next_god_of_war_does_bosses/,PS4,1

fr3qnl,Sugar-Dog-69,AC Odyssey is a better version of Witcher 3,"**Combat / Gameplay**

WINNER : Odyssey 

Both have a similar 3rd person ""Souls-lite"" combat system, but Odyssey has smoother mechanics and a much wider variety of playstyles. The archery is drastically superior in Odyssey than the crossbow in Witcher. Odyssey also has a wider range of special abilities that are more fun to use, plus the ability to climb and do parkour is a nice bonus for traversing the map. Most importantly, Odyssey provides a consistent challenge throughout the game (nightmare difficulty with all HUDs turned off is insane) whereas the Witcher combat starts to become a cakewalk once you reach around level 10 and doesn't pick up again until the DLCs. 


**Setting / World** 

WINNER : Odyssey 

The setting of the Witcher is well done, but ultimately it's just another Tolkien-esque make believe world. 

By contrast Odyssey takes place in an amazing recreation of Ancient Greece, that feels like taking a virtual historical tour. It also includes the mythology that was developed by centuries of Greek culture, and not just the fiction of one Polish author. 

Tolkien-esque fantasy can never compete with real history, real historical locations, and mythology that has been passed down for over 2000 years of Western Civilization. 


**Quests / Story**

WINNER : Witcher 3

Both games have an excessive amount of filler side quests that involve fetching items, amd both games can feel repetitive at times, but the Witcher 3 has a higher concentration of quality quests. There are some great quests in Odyssey as well, but they are diluted by a lot of forgettable filler quests. 

As far as the main story, the Witcher 3 story is fairly generic and predictable, but it is also more personal and less convoluted than the story in Odyssey. With that said, the backdrop of Athenian politics and the Peloponnesian war is a lot more interesting than the Witcher's backdrop with the Nilfguard conquest and the Wild Hunt invasion.  Still, the Witcher ultimately does a better job with the Hero's Journey 


**Boss fights**

WINNER : Odyssey

The Witcher 3 had a few memorable boss fights, such as the Griffin, the 3 Witches, Detlaf, and Graveyard Guy, but Odyssey takes the cake for a number of reasons. 

The bosses in Odyssey are slightly more difficult, faster paced, and have have more variety in their movesets, which is also boosted by the fact that Odyssey just has better combat in general. 

With that said, the big advantage just comes from what I mentioned earlier - Tolkien-esque fantasy can't compete with Greek Mythology. In Odyssey you get to fight the Knossos Minotaur, Medusa, the Cyclops, the Nemean Lion, and other legendary beasts from Greek Mythology, all of which are very well executed, especially the Minotaur and the Cyclops. Not too mention all of these bosses have great side quests leading up to them. 


**Characters / Voice Acting**

WINNER: The Witcher 3

The Witcher is fairly overrated when it comes to the writing for its characters, but the voice acting is so good that it largely makes up for that.

The Odyssey on the other hand is a bit of a mixed bag. Some people enjoy the voice acting, some people can't stand it. Overall I would say it's average to good voice acting, hit and miss dialogue, with some excellent character moments sprinkled in.

The saving grace for Odyssey though is how well some of the historical figures are portrayed, especially Kleon, who makes for a great villain. Socrates can be somewhat annoying at times, but that's fitting of how he was described to be in real life. Based on what I've read of Socrates, they did an excellent job of capturing his essence. 


**Graphics and Aesthetics**

WINNER : Odyssey

This is somewhat of an unfair comparison considering that Odyssey is a newer game, and both games look great. The edge goes to Odyssey for the amazing color palette and scenery, the incredible realistic looking water, the diversity of biomes (tropical islands, sprawling cities, deserts, ancient ruins, dense forests, mountains, flowery fields, etc). 

The Witcher 3 has some great aesthetics as well, but it's not on the same level.",55,1585476943,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fr3qnl/ac_odyssey_is_a_better_version_of_witcher_3/,PS4,1

fr312i,Romeo_Is_Dead20,Let‚Äôs Talk About Horizon Zero Dawn,"HUGE SPOILER WARNING: I‚Äôm talking about the end of Horizon Zero Dawn. So obviously there will be major spoilers...Just sayin‚Äô. 

 So, we all know that Aloy defeats HADES, right? Hopefully you do. Anyway, in the post-credits scenes, Aloy finds Elisabet Sobeck‚Äôs remains. (This scene honestly touched my heart a little and I don‚Äôt know why.)

 Afterwards, we see that HADES is still ‚Äòalive‚Äô (technically), and is currently in Sylen‚Äôs possession. Yes; Sylens, the man who helped Aloy get the Master Override in the first place, the one who her/us from the arena in Sunfall, yes. That guy. Apparently he has more to ‚Äòdiscuss‚Äô with the AI hellbent on global destruction- and more importantly- about its ‚Äòmasters‚Äô. 

 You know what this sounds like? Sounds like the setup for a sequel. 

 Despite the fact that the game was released over 3 years ago, it seems like we won‚Äôt be getting another game any time soon. And this is a (more than a little) saddening thought. HOWEVER! I could be wrong and we could get a sequel within a year or two (a little while after the COVID-19 dies out). I don‚Äôt expect a 2nd game to come out for a long time, especially as Guerrilla Games have yet to officially announce the sequel. It will almost certainly be a next-generation title at this point, so don't expect a release until after the PS5 release in late 2020.

Anyway, what did you think about the ending? Both of Aloy finding Elisabet and Sylens capturing HADES. I‚Äôm touched with Aloy‚Äôs and kind of upset they left up on a cliffhanger like that with Sylens and HADES.

fr2fa7,Liquidest_Ocelot,Used This Pandemic To Play Through The Bioshock Series.,"So this post is basically what the title says. With all that's been going on, I've taken the time to play through the Bioshock Remaster Trilogy we got on PS Plus last month.

It'd been about 10 years since i played the first game, and i fell back in love with it straight away and somehow i had forgotten about the amazing soundtrack! It promptly got added to my Spotify. Even though i remembered the twist, there was so many things i had forgotten. Especially the creepy and tense moments that Sander Cohen bring to the table, i remember as a teen, playing through it for the first time, being so on edge in the sections.

Then i moved onto Bioshock 2, (obviously) this one i hadn't played before, so i went in with limited knowledge of the story, and i find it a but underwhelming compared to the first game. Gameplay was quite repetitive, and they had too many escort missions in the guise of Little Sisters harvesting for my liking. Story was alright, nothing special, no big twist, and whilst i enjoyed it, i didn't love it.

And today, i imagine i will start Bioshock Infinite. Ive played it before a few years ago, and i remember it being a solid game and addition to the franchise. 

Lets take our minds off what's going on out there, and get lost in the world of games.

fr1mtm,pirajacinto,"Friend appears offline, says on PS3 when he is on his PS4 online","Me and a friend has been consistent connection issues, and one of the ideas we have is maybe it's because his account for some reason still only considers him playing online on PS3. I only guess this because he never appears online on the PS4, and the PS4 says the last time he was online was:

Over a Month Ago/PS3

And whenever we do play on the PS3, we almost never have internet connection issues. Could there be an issue with his PS4 connection? We tried wifi and wired and it disconnects after 10-15 minutes.

I assume it can't just be because he is putting himself showing as offline, because even in some games like WWE 2k19, I cannot invite him into a game unless I do ""Play Together"" as an option by party invite on the PS4 menu, and not from the in game menu.",3,1585464744,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fr1mtm/friend_appears_offline_says_on_ps3_when_he_is_on/,PS4,1

I'm hoping you are able to help me here. I had a previous post regarding the hair looking static-y in RE3 and someone gave me settings to apply to. However, I started playing the Predator Hunting Ground trial and the hair looks extremely static-y and the trees/background looks like a ps3 game.   


This is my TV:

LG 43UM7300PUA Alexa Built-in 43"" 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV (2019)

I previously had a Vizio 1080p TV that looked fine when I played games. Is my TV just not suited for displaying games properly? In all my games, they look amazing except for hair. It's really bad with this game too. Just wanted to know if there's a way to fix this somehow. I have a regular PS4. The photos below don't do it justice, its like fuzzy/static-y.

I want to say that the Anti-Aliasing is the issue here?

Is this simply an average/below average game that has been over-hyped? Am I about to hit a turning point where this gets good? Am I the only one with this opinion?

fqwotd,TheDorkNite1,"Used quarantine to finish TLOU, God of War, and....The Order...","Been putting them off for a long time. Figured it was finally time to tackle some PS exclusives I have been ignoring. Some thoughts

*The Last of Us:*

Dark, fantastic, and a story worthy of its time. I can't say the game is my favorite, but it is definitely one of the most memorable experiences I have had while gaming. Left Behind was a solid DLC follow up as well. I can't believe that this game's graphics are now ""outdated"", because they rival many games from even this past year. Looking forward to the sequel. 

*God of War:*

What a blast. Fun, exciting, and hilarious at times. The fighting, especially the boss fights, are such a standout compared to its predecessors. The devs really did a great job of writing Kratos to be more than what he was, and the writing for Atreus and especially Mimir was amazing. ""Head"" is likely my favorite side character in a long time. Really looking forward to the future, whenever that may be. I can't wait to bring the Spartan's rage to the halls of Odin.

*The Order:*

Well...I didn't hate it. I didn't like it either, but it definitely got better for me as the story went. I just felt that it was kind of a pointless story and generic gameplay. I wasn't a huge fan of the ""cinematic"" look they were going for but the visuals were quite stunning. I really liked the world and the ideas they were going for I just wish they had executed it better. The fights with the Lycans alone were incredibly boring and I felt really misled by the promotional material for this game. All that said, I would welcome a sequel from Ready at Dawn if they get the chance, as long as they fix the criticisms they received.

I feel like I need a break from darker games for a bit. The world is grim enough. But I'm glad I finally got through even a little bit of my backlog.",103,1585443602,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqwotd/used_quarantine_to_finish_tlou_god_of_war_andthe/,PS4,0

fqvhr2,itsyaboimarkie_,Desperately need help with my malfunctioning PS4.,"Okay so this is going to be a long one, and it's been a really confusing and complicated but I really need help.
So a couple of months back my PlayStation had stop casting to my TV. No video was being displayed on the TV despite both sources being powered on. I thought the issue was that my TV was just old and outdated (it's one those big back TV's.) I used my PlayStation on my living room TV which worked fine, so I started using that one. Something happened with my table and it fell, and the same problem happened with the previous TV. I went into the TV and just figured out that the projector in the TV had fell so I repositioned it and it started working once again. Suddenly there was a hissing noise then a MASSIVE pop and my TV screen just shut off, and wouldn't turn back on. I started to smell burning and I realized the TV had literally just blew out. 
So I got rid of that TV, understood that my PlayStation is not working with my old TV, bust my ass to get a new TV, only to figure out that all along it was my PlayStation. 
Now the problem here is that, my PlayStation didn't work on my TV or my friends TV (I tested it on his which works with his PlayStation) but only on the TV that blew out.. 
Is there a hardware issue here, or maybe my TV managed to also break my PlayStation when it blew out? (Which I can't believe it's that because it already wasn't working on my previous TV, And FYI, my switch was working on the TV but not my PlayStation..) I tried updating it today using my laptop and following many videos to blindly navigate safe mode because it was having some issues only to realize; how can I figure out if it's even updating or not?!
To be clear, yes I can boot up my PlayStation, even into safe mode, I can hear music from my controller upon plugging in headphones, but I do NOT see picture, even though it's a brand new SmartTV.
On the previous TV's other devices had connected and shown video, but not my PlayStation.
If there's a possible fix or maybe someone can tell me what the issue is? It's been driving me insane and I don't want to immediately jump to buying a new PlayStation because I'm in a bad state in terms of money.
(If this is rambling on to much I apologize and there is confusion, I apologize. any questions that can lead to an answer I will instantly answer them.)",0,1585439237,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqvhr2/desperately_need_help_with_my_malfunctioning_ps4/,PS4,0

fqv1o8,ArkhamIsComing2020,The Batman Arkham series has some of the best video game reveal trailers in gaming,"The video game industry has impressive cinematic trailers. But The Arkham series has impressive CGI trailers and more. The Arkham Origins one is a fine example. There's mastery work to the CGI, animation, detail and scene. The CGI looks like real life. The cinematics look like real life. The animation is better than some movies. These trailers actually have better CGI than movies like Justice League. Not to mention that these trailers are really epic. Blur Studios did a great job with them. They do most video game cinematic trailers. Arkham Knight's Father To Son trailer was amazing for many reasons. The voice over by Thomas Wayne, the CGI, the scenes themselves. 

Fun Fact. Arkham Origins reveal trailer was directed by the director of Deadpool.

I just hope the next Batman game has a impressive cinematic reveal trailer like these ones. But if you don't agree, then please share some other great cinematic trailers. I love watching them.

fqtqj8,PocketPasser10,Dumbest internet issue,"Hey everyone, I have this unique situation with my internet and its killing me especially because my entire state is on lockdown.

I've always had issues and there are moments where we get great connection for a week or so and then every day its literally trash. I have Comcast's best package and I've been making frequent calls and so many technicians have dropped by and can't solve the problem.

Long story short, my modem/router combo is in the basement and I play in the family room one floor up and I know using an ethernet cable is the most optimal, but I just can't. What worked before was having 2 Comcast modems one for lan line and one for internet and that worked like a charm until they started charging us for extra equipment even though there was no other solution without cutting off the phone line (my mom absolutely refuses to cause shes old school and doesn't understand) and I can't have someone come drill a hole in our floor to allow an ethernet connection either (again my mom is strict af and against that).

My download speed would be like 6.8mb on average and my upload hits in the kb range (its so bad). When they do a speed test in the basement, it reaches optimal levels (hundreds of MB download). Before I couldn't even connect consistently but now when I play Call of Duty I can play but if I wait in the multiplayer menu too long I get logged out and when I do play every minute I get an annoying 7 seconds of lag which allows me to play but its ridiculous. I tried a cheap wireless extender but it barely gets signal and I was told to try Comcast's pods which are like $150 or something.

I also searched to change my DNS settings to a specific number and I briefly looked into changing my PS4's wifi card or something but I don't wanna mess anything up. My connection with other devices are workable too its just when I game or stream movies on my PS4. I also have like 3 other iPads in the house streaming stuff.

Apparently theres no way around this other than cutting my phone line and putting the modem upstairs or drilling a hole to the basement and having an ethernet cable run through there and both are absolute no go's because of my mom.

Anyone have any ideas on other things I could try? Thanks in advance.",6,1585433288,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqtqj8/dumbest_internet_issue/,PS4,0

fqt5i3,witspeak,Button-Masher NHL Game? (Or something similar?),"Hey gang, brand new PS4 player here. I'm coming from having last played the 360 a few years ago. I'm not yet comfortable with the PS4 controls so I'm trying to ease my way in and I'm sure that will all come with time. I have never been much of a gamer, so consider me new to casual at best.

This subreddit has helped me with a few purchases and recommendations so far (thanks, search feature!) but now I need a little more specific help.

Do any of you know of an NHL game (probably years older by now, if it exists on the 4) that can be played more in a simple button masher style? I used to use the 360 to play NHL 11 (or something older like that), and the whole purpose was to create a custom team that was literally unbeatable. I'd listen to podcasts or audiobooks while just demolishing a computer opponent, just to have something to do with my hands. I'm looking for something similar.

It could be a NHL game, a WWE game (those have gotten way less button mashy over the years but it there's one I've overlooked I'd love to know), or just some kind of fighting game that can be made so simple that it's basically on God mode. 

Specific, right?

I'm open to suggestions. I have already tried certain games I've seen mentioned here for good zone out games: 

Assassin's Creed (both Odyssey and Origins - so far I like them but the controls aren't second nature to me)

Red Dead Redemption 2 - same as above

No Man's Sky - totally confusing to me on every level

I am interested in trying Spiderman, I think. I love games like Fable, so I bought Witcher 3 on advice that it was similar; working on that one now.

fqswvn,BernLan,"Let's talk about SIE's Vita Exclusives, aka Gravity Rush and siblings","As we all know the Playstation Vita had a short and miserable life. However, it still managed to have a few great games, SIE in particular developed 3 games that were exclusive to it, Gravity Rush, Freedom Wars and Soul Sacrifice, in this post I want to discuss these titles and determine if they deserve a second chance on the PS4. 

Let's start with Gravity Rush, I'm sure you are all somewhat familiar with the game since it DID get a second chance on the PS4, with both a Remaster and a Sequel. In this game you play as Kat, a girl that seemingly lost her memory and can control gravity thanks to her cat, Dusty, through the course of the game you fight creatures called Nevi and unravel some of the mysteries behind this world, overall it is a fun game, to the point where Kat became playable in Playstation All-Stars as DLC, which was the catalyst for Gravity Rush's growth in popularity and possibly the reason why it got a Remaster and a Sequel on the PS4.

Now let's talk about Freedom Wars, my personal favorite, in this game you play as a Sinner, a prisoner of a huge prison called a Panopticon, that are named after real life cities, this happens in a far future. You fight against enormous ""robots"" called Abductors, they kidnap Citizens (a social class above Sinners) and it's up to you to save them (using Thorns, an ability you possess that functions similarly to a grappling hook and sci-fi weapons) with the help of your android companion called an Accessory. Gameplay wise it's a mix between Monster Hunter and an Attack on Titan game. It is to this day one of the best, if not the best Vita Exclusive, unfortunately though, it ended on a cliffhanger and with many unanswered questions, so I think that ideally it should get the same treatment as Gravity Rush, a Remaster to introduce people to the franchise and a Sequel to tie loose ends on the story. 

And last but not least, Soul Sacrifice, in a world of sorcerers the present is ruled by a powerful sorcerer named Magusar, you, a regular prisoner manage to get your hands on a mysterious talking book, Librom, by reading Librom you relive the past and unlock the secrets of Magusar's past, every time an enemy perishes before you, you can choose to either save their cursed souls or end their suffering by sacrificing their souls, if you save them your HP increases and if you sacrifice them you become more powerful. Over the course of the game you witness both yours and Magusar's sanity decrease little by little. Gameplay wise it's a Monster Hunter game, but instead of having a huge variety of distinct weapons, you have an arsenal of spells at your disposal. Unlike Freedom Wars this game didn't end with a cliffhanger, but actually has two different endings with both leaving room open for a sequel despite neither being a cliffhanger, it also ended with a really good message that you are not able to save everyone and in order to move on sacrifices are necessary. After it's release Soul Sacrifice got an expanded version called Soul Sacrifice Delta. I don't feel like a sequel is necessary, instead, just remastering Soul Sacrifice Delta might be enough to bring attention to the franchise.

Have you played these games? Do these games deserve a second chance? Do you think things would have been different if a Sinner or Sorcerer got into Playstation All-Stars instead of Kat?",5,1585430683,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqswvn/lets_talk_about_sies_vita_exclusives_aka_gravity/,PS4,1

fqs1x9,youngsimba320,"Everytime I turn off my PS4 it ""checks for system storage"" in Safe Mode. Help.","I have a regular Ps4. Almost 3 years old. This has never happened before until yesterday. It has happened again today.

The first time it happened I remember turning off my ps4 and turning it back on the next day and it sent me to a ""checking for system storage"" screen and forced me to reinstall the software.  I downloaded software 7.02 on a USB and reinstalled it to my ps4. it worked fine and played games no problem.

 I thought all was fine until I turned it off this morning and come to find out it sent me to the same ""checking for system storage"" screen again and forced me to reinstall system version 7.02.

Why is this happening all of a sudden?

Is my hardware dying on me?

Will this happen every time I turn off my console?

If anyone else has experienced this before please share your possible solutions and any reasons why this is happening.

I‚Äôve had the sane problem for at least a year now. For example, letting go of the left stick after holding it to the right, will see my character continue to move that direction for 2-3 seconds after releasing. This happens whether or not anything is plugged into the USB ports. I have to move and point the controller toward the front of the PlayStation to ‚Äúrecalibrate‚Äù it. However, the glitches are inevitable. 

Also, plugging a mic into the controller will result in choppy audio, whether it be chatting with a friend or listening to the game audio. 

I‚Äôve assumed these issues were because of old age. I‚Äôve owned 3 controllers at once and 2 and the problems still arise. Anyone know what‚Äôs going on or if you can/how to fix it?",1,1585419027,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqp8zt/having_controller_connectivity_issues/,PS4,0

These are obviously necessary features, and have saved me a lot of annoyance when trying to play alone but get away from game chat, or when attempting to get as many friends who want to play multiplayer into chat as possible. A while ago, PSN added a ""custom list"" feature to add whatever friends you'd like to a custom list to more easily invite them to games, parties, etc. I propose that PSN add a party feature that enables a ""[Custom List] only"" feature, where only people from that custom list on the host's profile can join without invitation. It's a mix between public and private, and enables all your friends to join without having random players join your party and ruin your experience or just come in unwanted.

fqjrq8,Frogsplosion,Quarantine Master Playlist for PS4,"So I had an idea, since a lot of us are on lockdown now is a great time to help people discover games they may have either heard of but never played, or never heard of at all. 

Why don't we all take turns giving a brief mini review / recommendation of some of our favorite PS4 games available digitally to provide a nice big list of things people can check out?

I'll start:

Age of Wonders: Planetfall - This game is fantastic and I could recommend it to anyone. It's essentially Civilization in space but has a bit more depth than that, combat is handled separately in an X-Com style tactical grid with all sorts of different units with different abilities as well as a hero unit you can equip with all sorts of sweet tech. There are multiple different races to choose from and lots of single player content. You could spend hundreds of hours playing Age of Wonders: Planetfall, especially if you are the type of person who enjoys 4x games like Civilization and enjoys Skirmish mode vs AI. If you like strategy games I think this title is absolutely worth giving a shot :D

Dark Souls 3 - Literally can't recommend this enough. If you are someone who enjoys mechanically deep games and doesn't mind a bit of a challenge Dark Souls 3 has the most active online and co op play in the series and a very active subreddit where people are always happy to help out. If the difficulty is a concern I would honestly recommend looking up guides on youtube or fextralife, you can mitigate a lot of the frustration by actively learning about the game. DS3 is an action oriented RPG and I emphasize the RPG part, once you get used to the combat most of your roadblocks can be solved by pumping stats or upgrading weapons or searching for new equipment in areas previously unlocked. If you have trouble with bosses don't be afraid to summon help, not everyone solos bosses on their first go through the game. There is so much to do and so many ways to play this game it will keep you busy for years if you are willing to put in the time.",10,1585400484,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqjrq8/quarantine_master_playlist_for_ps4/,PS4,1

On my profile page, it says ""Trophies Unavailable"" for all these games and going into the Trophies section directly from the main menu, none of these games are listed there.

fqjkwg,Terockt-Not,Can two PSN accounts with different regions share Iceborne DLC on the same PS4?,"

So some information regarding the game. The base game and DLC are region locked. Meaning both base game and DLC must be registered under the same region, else they aren‚Äôt compatible and won‚Äôt work.

Example:
EU base game + EU DLC = playable
EU base game + Asia DLC = not playable

So I‚Äôve ran into a problem recently. I own the base game disc ver. and have about 100 hours logged on it. Recently picked it back up cause some friends got it for free for PS+ and we played the base game for a bit. Now, my disc ver. is under the European region however my PSN account is registered in Asia. We decided to buy Iceborne but i realised I can‚Äôt access it when I boot up the game. Did some research and realised it‚Äôs region locked. Refunded the Iceborne DLC after that.

I did some research and created a new PSN account registered in the European region on the same PS4. I set that account as my main PS4 because that allows any game you purchase to be playable on other accounts. My plan was to buy Iceborne on the EU PSN account in hopes that it will be playable on my Asia PSN account since that‚Äôs where my 100 hour save game is. However, I did some research online and got some mixed results, some say it‚Äôs going to work but some say it won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not ready to drop 30-ish pounds before knowing if it‚Äôs going to be playable on my Asia PSN account or not.

TL;DR: Playing EU MHW on an Asia PSN account and can‚Äôt play the DLC because it‚Äôs incompatible. Does buying on an EU PSN account allow me to play the DLC with my original save game on Asia PSN account?",3,1585399715,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqjkwg/can_two_psn_accounts_with_different_regions_share/,PS4,1

fqiwds,Virltommy,I honestly think Shadow of Mordor is far better than its sequel Shadow of War,"Shadow of Mordor doesn¬¥t treat its uruks/orcs like a complete joke, they actually look diry, grotesque, scary and threatening.

While Shadow of War offers more gameplay options and tools to mess around wtih, imo it doesn¬¥t feel cohesive and feels massively bloated. I believe there are too many mechanics in Shadow of War that are at odds with each other. Shadow of Mordor on the other hands feel like a really tight little game.

And while the story isn¬¥t anything too special in Shadow of Mordor it¬¥s at least quite focussed and takes itself seriously. I like that it¬¥s dark and gritty. 

Don¬¥t get me wrong, I still think Shadow of War is quite a fun game, you can really have a lot of fun with it. But I do feel it¬¥s completely inferior to its predecessor.

fqifre,TubaXYZ,Is it worth it buying the PS4 now? (TL;DR Below),"With the PS5 coming very soon at around 8 months buying the PS4 seems like a shit idea.

But listen, I bought a nintendo switch last year and i got a couple of games on it. But then I was surprised at the lack of games it had compared to the PS4 such as call of duty, GTA 5 and the much more powerful computing abilities. This led me to think of reselling my switch and its games and getting the PS4 and its games. I have taken really good care of my equipment so I believe i could sell my things quickly for at least 80-85% of the original market price.

But that is not the main issue here. What will I do when the ps5 comes out? I thought that I could sell the PS4 around the final clock for 60% of the price and slap 250 bucks on top to get the PS5.

Is this a good idea? Tell me what do you think.

TL;DR should I sell my switch and its games to buy a ps4 and games? my equipment are all almost mint condition, and i'll cater to that when i get the ps4 so i could sell it later to get the ps5 when it arrives.",10,1585394893,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqifre/is_it_worth_it_buying_the_ps4_now_tldr_below/,PS4,1

These are some things you can do to get your account back :

Act quickly but stay calm.

Change your password if you still have access 

Activate 2 factor authentication.

Try to delete all spare accounts and leave 2 accounts behind (for you and a friend)

Add a security question for when you log in.

Add a password for both accounts when they log in, (4 digit passcode, this setting is found under account management.)

Switch the ‚ÄúMake New Accounts‚Äù (Like making a guest account or new account) off to prevent them from making a new account. (This setting is found under parental controls)

Remove all credit cards and credit card information from the PS4.

Contact PlayStation support if still having issues.

It takes for too long to shut down, restart  and simply click on buttons (it also makes weird sounds). So I came to the conclusion that it was my ps4 but then I decided to play other games such as undertale and the last of us and it works fine.  Ive rebuilt the database, checked the hard drive and even reset the console but nothings working so i then went back to thinking it was the disc so i decided to eject the disc and watch my saved videos of fifa 20 that i knew were fine and my ps4 kept lagging when trying to watch it. Im sorry for vague details but im truly confused with what is happening.

fqecb0,BootyJibbler,I don‚Äôt normally go out of my way to warn people about games but Predator Hunting Ground is BAD,"Seriously this game has some next level issues to fix before launch. Enemies will fall into the ground and still be able to shoot/kill you, the game RARELY locks at 30 FPS so you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre playing a slide show and the textures/resolution look almost like a ps3 game. On the gameplay side the predator feels like a fly you just swat away. Completely non-threatening. The AI and objectives feel cut and paste out of fallout or something so all you‚Äôll be doing is running through and checking off a checklist of shit to do until a helicopter picks you up while you brush off the predator. All of this is even if you make it past the 10 minute queue time. 

This game needs a delay and some actual work put into it. For the price tag attached to it this game is NOT worth it.

fqd0ck,_mischief-managed_,Bought a PS4 and played 4 Sony exclusives off the bat including TLOU,"So I bought a PS4 Bundle for the quarantine and it came with God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and The Last of Us remastered. I also bought The Show, AND Uncharted 4 cuz I like tomb raider and wanted to check it out. The only console this gen and last gen I didnt get was a playstation because I dont like them. Never really did. I have an xbox, a switch, and a gaming pc as well. I play on PC the most and the switch and a the xbox fairly often. BUT people have always told me that sony exclusives were basically the best games you could play especially the last of us. So I never watched any lets plays or anything on the off chance id buy a ps4 one day. Strangely enough a global pandemic begins and its literally the perfect time to invest in a new console. I get my PS4 and its alright. Party system is a little tedious at times, interface is a tad annoying, and the no free trial for plus really bothered me at first but I got over it. What made up for all that is the fact that almost everyone I know has a PS4 so now I can game with people I havent been able to in years, which is nice. So first things first I watch ALL the god of war games and some lore vids over a few days on youtube so I can play the new one. The story was great so then I played the new one and it was one of the best gaming experiences ive ever had. Legit near perfect if not perfect game. 9.5/10 at least. Off to a fckin great start, playstation. THEN I play Zero Dawn and it was pretty good, not amazing but not bad, definitely a solid game that I enjoyed well enough. Next I watch the first 3 uncharted games on youtube, I thought about buying the collection but I didnt want to playthrough 3 decade+ old games just to play 4 so I just watched them. I get to uncharted 4 and it really was a tremendous game. The puzzles were fun, the story was pretty good with the pirates and the lost colony mystery, nate‚Äôs brother, and nate struggling with life outside treasure hunting and adventure. The climbing mechanics were good and the combat was serviceable. I REALLY liked it. It kept me very intrigued all the way through. I legitimately wanted to find out about what happened to these pirates. So after playing 2 great and 1 pretty good game, im really looking forward to tlou cuz this is gonna be the one. The crown jewel of playstation. Naughtydog‚Äôs Magnum Opus...but then I played it. It was hyped up to me for YEARS. Since I was in high school. 6 years later, I play the game and I cant for the life of me see what all the fuss is about? It was honestly the most let down ive ever been. Nothing about the game was really GREAT everything about it was either good or bad. Story, good. Just good. Been done a million times. Guy has to look after and protect a child in a fucked up world. And the world itself, not unique at all. A plague that turns everyone into gross fungus zombies...okay? So? Joel and Ellie are good characters I liked them well enough but not as well as Nathan Drake and Sully. Or Daddy Kratos and THE BOY.  I just thought the world and story were a little mediocre. The gameplay however...WOW much worse. Shooting mechanics were god awful and the stealth mechanics were infuriating to say the least. I think Uncharted 4 is Naughtydog‚Äôs better game if we‚Äôre being honest. I just dont see whats so good about tlou. Its not particularly unique in any way, and it certainly doesnt excel at anything it sets out to do. People say ‚Äúit tells a story like a movie or a good book like no other game ever has. its more of that than a video game‚Äù well if i wanted to watch a movie about this stuff or read a book id watch world war z or read the road. Because theyre almost the exact same thing. Dont rage on me, Im just venting my thoughts. Im enjoying my PS4 and these good games for sure. I was just shocked that the last of us was nothing like I was expecting it to be. Maybe my expectations after the years of hype were just too high.",6,1585368451,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqd0ck/bought_a_ps4_and_played_4_sony_exclusives_off_the/,PS4,1

When I connect my controller by USB and press the PS button nothing happens.

I've tried:

- Connecting different controllers by USB
- Resetting the controllers
- Trying a PS3 controller
- Resetting the PS4 by holding onto the power button
- Resetting the PS4 by disconnecting all cables and leaving for 30 mins
- Changing hard drives

Nothing works. I always end up at the same screen asking me to press start on my controller, and it never working.

I've searched Google extensively and none of the recommendations have worked.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

fqbvx5,Status_Western,linking old PS4 controller to new PS4?,"Hi Everyone. I've encountered a frustrating situation and I'm hoping someone might be able to help me. Being on lockdown, my wife and I decided to order a new PS4 Slim TB Console which arrived at our house today. I had a previous PS4 that I probably bought circa 2014-2015, but it started blinking with the blue light of death a few months back and that was that. I have 2 controllers left over from the old PS4, and the new one came with 1 new controller. What I failed to anticipate is that the new controller is of a new generation; the USB port is entirely different from the one located on the 2 older controls, and whatever USB cable I had to hook the older controllers up to the older PS4 is long gone. 

So here's my question: is there any way to pair these older controllers to my newer PS4 when I don't have a compatible USB cable? The only thing my manual says I can do to pair a control is to plug it into the PS4 itself. 

We were planning on playing 2-player, split-screen Borderlands - it's what we used to do together a lot before we were married. We thought revisiting it would be a fun way to pass the time. 

If there's really no way to pair a controller without plugging it in, does any one know what type of USB port an older model control has? (MODEL CUH-ZCT2U) I guess I'll have order the proper USB port if necessary. (assuming they are easy to get ahold of.)

I thought it happened sometimes when it‚Äôs overworked. But it happened the other day when I only played for 1.5 hours. How do I fix this?",1,1585359032,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fqalmp/bought_a_second_hand_ps4_recently/,PS4,1

I'm a musician and i'm used to the sound of Sennheiser headphones I use (borrow) in the studio. But Gaming seems to be a very different soundscape. I primarily want good sound quality and immersion in gaming, playing primarily FPS games. Closed back headphones are preferred since I live in a busy household with lots of noise. I value comfort and sound quality most. I do want a headset with a mic for multiplayers, but don't care much about the sound quality of the mic, as long as my friends can hear me clearly. I also want the headset to be wireless, since i'm really bothered by cable noise. My budget is around ‚Ç¨150,- (or $170,- USD).

I have a PS4 Pro and a Vizio 4K smart tv (M50-E1). I notice that every time I start the PS4, the main dashboard is gorgeous, vibrant, and crisp. Then, whenever I start a game (the past two games I‚Äôve been playing are Modern Warfare and God of War) the resolution changes and looks degraded in-game, like it‚Äôs definitely not coming out in 4K, I think it‚Äôs probably reverting to 1080p. Then when I go back to my dashboard, the colors are dark and everything is pixelated, looks not good at all. When I close the application, the screen goes dark, then comes back on and the resolution goes back to normal, gorgeous and crisp. Does anyone have any ideas why just playing a game is causing such horrible looking output?

I will say, I don‚Äôt know if this has anything to do with it, but a few months ago I had a power outage and the surge I think ruined the HDMI 1 port on my tv (which is where my PS4 was plugged in) because whenever something is plugged into it, the screen is either black or it‚Äôs horrible pixelated output. So I‚Äôve been plugged into HDMI 4 (which says ‚Äúbest‚Äù on my tv) and I‚Äôve still been having these issues. Did the surge maybe fuck up the port on my PS4? Could it have damaged the hdmi cable?

fq5x91,Dragon3002,Solution to PS4 Error: wc-40382-7 Where your Credit/Debit Card Not Working to buy PS PLUS,"Hello, and welcome

Sorry my English is not perfect but I will try my best to get to the point. Anyhow lets start :) This a fix for the Error where your Credit/Debit Card Not Working or not accepted by PlayStation to buy the PS Plus from within the PS4... Error: wc-40382-7

Try this method with other payment errors, it may fix it :)

==============================

If you like reading Please go down, and see the Steps, 

if not Check the **YouTube Video**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28-kpNDpeUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28-kpNDpeUs)

==============================

**Steps:**

1- First go to your PS4 Setting -&gt; Account Management -&gt;  Account Information -&gt; Wallet -&gt; Payment Methods

2- Enter your password then chose the card that is not working and check everything is written right like your name, and be sure you are only using English alphabet. Also check the Numbers of you card are entered correctly, and the 3 digits in the back. More importantly check your address is the same as your bank address. If you are sure everything in step 2 is good continue to step 3.

3- Good back to the main screen and go to the PlayStation Store, this step  will decide if your card can be used for the PS PLUS or not. Anyhow, scroll down to Games click on it and go to All Games. Then click on the sort box on the to right corner chose Price:Low-High. After that chose any cheep game **BUT NOT FREE**, and add it to your Cart then click on Proceed to Checkout, and wait to be directed to payment page. After that  chose the card that is not working and buy the game. If you are successful with purchase then please go to step 4.

4- Good news your card is working fine, and it can be used to buy the  PS PLUS from within the PlayStation Store. OK, now go back to main screen, and go back to Setting -&gt; Account Management -&gt; Account Information -&gt; Wallet -&gt; Add Funds 

5- Be sure you are at **Add Funds**, and yes this the trick here. After you click at Add Funds it will direct you to chose a payment method, so chose the card that is not working then chose how much amount you want to add to the Wallet. Click Continue to buy Funds. If the Funds have been added please go to step 6.

6- You are almost done here, just go back to the PlayStation Store and now click on the PS Plus from the list, then chose how many months you want to buy and add it to your Cart.

7- Next go to your Cart and Click on Proceed to Checkout, and at this time the magic happens :) the page where you will be asked to chose a payment method will not show because it will ask you if you want to use your Wallet amount, and click YES, and HERE YOU GO, now you have the PS Plus in your account.

&amp;#x200B;

Congratulation, and Enjoy it :) I hope this will help some, if it dose please don't for get to go to channel and support me with a like, share, comment, and a Subscribe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good Luck, And have Fun. Also don't Forget Stay HOME :)

&amp;#x200B;

**P.S. Next time you can just use your card normally for some reason now it works without adding the funds :)**",0,1585343652,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fq5x91/solution_to_ps4_error_wc403827_where_your/,PS4,1

fq5vf8,Sotordamotor,"Not a creepy Pasta but it sure feels like one. Strange messages, Notifications about being watched/recorded. Extreme bandwidth consumption. Downloads crashing.","I have been having some strange issues with my PS4. I bought it used a few years ago. 

Since I have gotten it, I have always been getting random messages from accounts with no game or trophy data attached to it. They would always read something like this ""tw√µ w√µrd q≈≥√≤t√©Ev√®r√Ωth√¨ng c√≥≈Ønts √≤l√°√´≈±s√≤≈Ø√≤√†rt≈´r√≤k""
I just assumed it was some bots. Soon, they started getting weirder and weirder. One of them was talking about how I shouldn't stay up too late, a student should be studying and sleeping and I should finish book four? Really specific stuff. I decided I should reply. Explaining I was not a student, I was a grown man. I don't think I am who you think I am..

They responded asking where I live. I replied by saying ""Under your bed""

They kept messaging back but I ignored them and did not think much about it. 

All of a sudden I start getting notifications when I was playing Apex Legends. When I entered the loading screen it would say, Gameplay recording paused. Then when I would get to the next screen it would say Gameplay recording resumed. I thought it was weird but again did not think about it. Whatever was happening was not an issue until my PS4 could not maintain a stable connection when online. I would be lagging like crazy, the thing would suck up all the bandwidth at my house and it was making Apex unplayable. Then I decided to download some single-player games. When I tried, the download time would always be 10+ hours to download then crash after about an hour. I tried everything, wired internet connection, system restarts form boot safe menu, data restructuring, I even backed up my saves and did a system initialization. Still, the same issue would say 10+ hours for download and would crash after an hour. 

I then decided that maybe these strange messages and recording notifications were linked somehow. So I went through and blocked every account that sent me a message. Cleared my friend's list to only people I know IRL and changed my privacy settings to be only friends for everything. I thought it was a long shot but guess what. It worked. No more crashes, no more lag, no more anything. The thing works perfectly now. 

It is really strange and frankly kinda creepy. I think someone was spying on me.",4,1585343500,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fq5vf8/not_a_creepy_pasta_but_it_sure_feels_like_one/,PS4,1

I'm incredibly frustrated by a problem I've been having with my controller. A few days ago, I paired it via bluetooth with my Macbook, so that I could use it for Remote Play. Since then, I haven't been able to re-connect it to my console. I've tried EVERYTHING - hard-reset of the console, factory reset of the controller, plugging it in via micro-USB, removing the device from my Mac via the bluetooth settings on there...I'm not sure what else to try at this point.

fq4i2r,MrMostwanted11,PS4 wants me to update it to Update 7.02..... even when I already did?,"So here's my issue. The first time Update 7.02 came out, it started my PS4 in a safe mode window which asked me to update the PS4 to 7.02, I downloaded the 400mb update, but it did not accept it, people told me to use the 1gb update but I didnt because I did not have my save files backed up. I pretty much forgot about it later due to my pre exams. When I started the console again a month later, it started normally and I downloaded the update normally, knowing it was fixed I did not backup my saves. Now I packed up my PS4 away because my finals were approaching, with the PS4 updated to 7.02.

A month later, I start my PS4 again because my exams are kind of over? (got postponed sadly, I only had 1 left). Now I turn it on, and would you look at that, its BLOD, but that kind of got fixed? Second attempt to start it on, the safe mode is back asking me to update the PS4 to 7.02.....

Welp, I try the 400mb again, it doesnt work. Since my files werent backed up I didnt want to use the 1 gb update. This issue went on for days, everyday, for sometime during some weird window my PS4 started normally but always crashed after a while. I fortunately was able to back up my files during this period, and proceeded to use the 1 gb update, which initialized my PS4. Okay problem solved. Everything is fine.

But it wasnt...? Right now I started my PS4 and its again, again... asking me to update to bloody 7.02.

Okay, I start it again a couple of times, it loads up twice with the window saying ""checking system storage"" something along the lines, the PS4 loads into ""report problem"" window twice, crashes the first time, loads normally in the second, however in the second time which I just checked after writing the previous paragraph, it hangs, and eventually crashes with a White Light on the console, it turns off when I hold the power button down, makes 2-3 beeps when I press the power button once though so its not exactly on. (It turned off on its on rn tho. So theres that.)

I still only have the 500GB PS4 so I had CoD Warzone, Division 2, Black Ops 3 and Crash Bandicoot installed. This took up pretty much all of my storage. 

I didn‚Äôt have the base game for MW installed so I tried to install it. I needed to free up 5GB so I deleted Black Ops 3 (which is a 100+ GB install) which left me with more than enough. I then had over 100GB (maybe around 120-130) so I decided to reinstall GTAV but it told me I didn‚Äôt have enough storage and I would have to free up  around 30GB. I didn‚Äôt want to delete another game so I just left it.

I‚Äôve tested all different audio and video configurations from messing with hdr to routing the audio through HDMI through the soundbar but this seems to be a recurring issue with either my console itself or the games on it.

Second: when someone posts a valid question and uses a wrong or too vage title (vagueness isnt really objective, it can depend on the mood of a mod) i think they should get the opportunity to change the title. Its the same afford for a mod to simply ask for a title change then just remove the post without warning. Especially if there are already replies. I dont know if mods are able to edit the title themselves, but at least leave a comment, and give the users some time to react.

fpwzyb,NibbaMadeMe,[Help] My PS4 downloads speeds are super low but from my PC/phone they are pretty high,"Just like the title says, when I check my download/upload speeds from my PC (using an ethernet cable) they are 80MB/3MB (Download/Upload). However, when I check them from my PS4 using the test network (or something like that) feature, they are 2MB/2MB (I'm also using an ethernet cable for my PS4). And even if the download speed shows the occasional 40MB, when I go to the download bar of the game I'm trying to download its still downloading at a super slow rate (1.5-2MB), its like they don't have any correlation?

I'm currently trying to download an 11GB update and it's super furstrating watching the download bar barely move.

Anyone know why this is happening or what can I do to improve the speeds?

Thank you to everyone who tries to help!

PS: just a few extra details: my network has at most 2-3 users on it at any given time, my PS4, my PC, and another phone connected via WiFi. I live far away from the playstation servers (am using the european servers but don't really live in Europe), usually when I play online games my ping is around 100ms sometimes less (70-80ms) and sometimes a bit higher (120ms), if it even matters.",6,1585315988,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fpwzyb/help_my_ps4_downloads_speeds_are_super_low_but/,PS4,1

My question is, is there a way to enable the sidetone functionality on the PS4 with this headset?

So I was browsing through what was on sale, and noticed Bard's Tale 4, which I had been meaning to pick up for awhile. That got me thinking - the old school grid based dungeon crawl (or what some people call blobbers) is one of my favorite genres, and I've played a few on PS4, but I'm sure there are some I'm missing. Can someone post some of their fav's, or maybe if there's another list out there somewhere? If you just google 'dungeon crawl' it brings back stuff like Diablo. I'm more thinking things in the vein of Wizardry, Might and Magic, Etrian Odyssey kinda the old school grid based things where you get to map an area. (What can I say, I like mapping) Preferently turn based and not real time. Not a fan of the Dungeon Master and that branch of the RPG tree. (Grimrock and the like)

I was wondering if any of you could help me!!
I recently purchased a new tv and since doing so my ps4 has had a consistant issue among a couple of games. 

Upon opening games such as rocket league and battlefront 2, the game loads for a brief moment before losing hdmi connection (similar to when you turn the hdcp off and on) and returning with a lower colour saturation and slight blur. The whole console then runs at a lagging rate until the application is closed completely. 

I have changed settings to automatic when it comes to screen resolution, colour output ect. But still get the same problem.

If any of you have some advice on how to fix this it would be most appreciated!!!!!

fpufmy,nathan_NG,New to PS4: Great games to play if you can only play every now and then?,"Hi guys, 

what are great games if you dont have time to play regularly?

I got myself a PS4 to play when I have a night off but sometimes I dont have time for like 5-6 days. 

I borrowed the Witcher from a friend because I used to like RPGs but its not really a game you can play on and off, you really need to invest time to enjoy it.

And I feel like this is the case for most of the highly recommended games on this sub...

Im not really into sports, racing games or jump and runs.

fpsj04,Crshrlpr,Playstation being unfair and exploiting the oppurtunity that COVID-19 created about game sales in Turkey.," 

In the days where people have to stay home and pretty much only way to pass time is to play games right?

This means people purchasing games to pass time. There are big sales, such as Mega March so people while being unable to earn money at times because of loss of employments in certain areas etc. Right?

While this is all true for PS-US or PS-UK or pretty much every other brach of Playstation, ***\*Playstation has removed all discounts from games in Turkey.\****

**Even the ""Deals"" tab from the Playstation Turkish store is gone.**

The games are already absurdly overpriced for our currency, and in a time of global pandemic and quarantine, Playstation Turkey does such a thing. For example, steam changes their game prices according to GDPs of countries so everyone can enjoy their games. Turkey's economy has crashed significantly since 2008, where in 2008 $1 was basically 1.10 Turkish lira, right now $1 is pretty much 6.5 Turkish lira. And the minimum wage after taxes since 1st of January 2020 in Turkey is 2,324 TRY ($362). Let's see how much ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare"" costs in Turkish playstation store. 469 Turkish Lira. That is almost 20% of the minimum wage. We have been complaining about this for a long time, yes but our Economy crashed, we have to deal with this we said. But removing sales? That is just wrong. People have been boycotting this for a while and they have not made a single statement. They don't care, at all.

This is how you lose millions of customers.

I don't know what do you guys think about this, if you agree or disagree with their actions or if you care at all but I just wanted more people to see this and maybe voice their opinions about this. Or maybe if it gets enough attention they will actually say something about it atleast?

Thank you guys for taking some time to read my ""rant"" if you have any opinions, please feel free to state them whether if you agree or not.

fppu5w,xPlaynilo,Certain things I noticed in the Dualshock 4.,"Hello everyone,

First of all, I just noticed some things on the Dualshock 4 and I am sure it is not placebo. I am in love with details, so I notice little details.


1. When the communication method per USB is activated, the Dualshock 4 actually has more input lag over wired. I noticed this when I played Battlefield and The Last of Us and I am sure it felt like the system can't handle the input stack up in a short time. 

2. Depends on the headset, the audio (microphone including) sounds better or worse. I tested on some headsets and some of them got better audio, some not.

3. Also, depending on the headset, people in the party will complain about buzzing or echoing when the Dualshock 4 is working through the cable.

4. My favourite part which is definitely not placebo, but could interesting for anyone competitive player like me: I just plugged in my headset into the monitor and the controller feels soo smooth and responsive. Maybe it has something to do with less load on that controller?
I just tested it on a training range in Apex Legends and my aim was crispy.

5. There is no audio delay when you don't get audio via wireless or through the controller. I assume 50-100ms delay.


Is there also you find out on the controller? Let me know",3,1585279801,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fppu5w/certain_things_i_noticed_in_the_dualshock_4/,PS4,1

When Im downloading updates and DLC, if the size is only a few gb (like 3-5 gb) then the thing will probably take 8 hours or more on average. For some reason when I tried to start downloading the new Borderlands 3 update and dlc earlier (the dlc was around 8.5 gb and the update is around 5.5 gb) they both said ‚Äú99+ hours‚Äù on the download time. I managed to get them to alternate between 99+ to the high 70‚Äôs. Obviously this still isn‚Äôt acceptable though. I looked online and tried to see if I could delete the network and reconnect the PS4 to it. Alot of stuff I saw said you could just restore default settings and it would work and it ALSO wouldnt delete game save data. However I saw too many people saying that this deletes their data so I am NOT doing this. Also saw stuff about changing DNS servers but 1. I have absolutely no idea how this works, what it is, what it does, etc (I am not very tech/internet savvy) and 2. There were a few people saying that changing DNS doesn‚Äôt affect download speeds. So my questions are: What could cause the change from bad download speeds to ‚Äúso unacceptable that there is not point in doing it‚Äù?

Im assuming some threads here will lead into that bigger title. This was a nice little appetizer for that. It was like a prologue. It kept me intrigued which is impressive because its actually a little dull presentation wise.

fpitlc,Yamis1brother,My PS4 has had to be factory reset 6 times in the past 2 months. What can I do to fix it?,"Hi all, so as the title says, my PS4 has had to be factory reset 6 times this year. The first one happened back around mid-January of this year and has happened randomly in the months following.

For context, it all started back when I was playing a game called Agents of Mayhem. Basically what happened was I was walking through the open world only to get stuck. I got stuck so bad I couldn't move, and when I went to close the game, it crashed. Frustrated, I went to Black Oos 3. Game wouldn't launch despite it working just fine the day before. Checked Titanfall 2, which was fine, but BO3? Nothing. I decided to restart the PS4 to see if it would work then, but instead came up the initialization screen and lo and behold, I had to factory reset my PS4.

Since then, my PS4 has had a plethora of problems. YouTube starting to load, only to then just kick me out to the dashboard, Spotify going black on me even though it's still technically working, and of course, factory resets.

There has been no consistency between resets (as in, all 6 of my resets happened for different reasons). For example, my most recent one (which happened today), happened because the PS4 couldn't handle opening up my trophy list and would go to a black screen and tell me system software error whenever I tried loading it. 

The one before that? I had to reset my PS4 because I went on vacation and apparently being turned off for 10 days warranted a factory reset.

I'm honestly so fed up that I wanted to just buy a new PS4, but I can't afford one at the moment. So I have to try and fix this one. 

So, what can I do and how do I do it? Any advice is appreciated because I don't know how to approach this mess. 

I apologize for making this post kind of long but I feel like this is a fairly odd case and needed some decent contextualization first.",7,1585253943,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fpitlc/my_ps4_has_had_to_be_factory_reset_6_times_in_the/,PS4,1

fpirmk,WickedHardcorg,Headset/mic echo issues... help greatly appreciated!,"Hello! I'll try to keep this short and to-the-point.   


I've recently started streaming to Twitch directly from my PS4 in my down time. While I hope to get a proper setup in time, I'm mostly just experimenting with it for now for fun.   


However, I've noticed that my voice is consistently echoing on my streams, as well as in my friend's stream, as we often party up and stream together. I have tried adjusting every setting I can think of from mic sensitivity to chat/audio balance to party audio settings. Not only does it echo on stream, but I typically hear my own voice in the earpieces, with about a half-second delay.   


For reference, I am using a Playstation Gold headset. I have messed with what I believe is ""sidetone"" (holding the Mute button for various settings) and I have left it at the ""low pitch beep"" setting if that makes sense, though I am not 100% familiar with what this setting is. I have 2 Playstation Gold headsets as well as some cheap $20 third-party headset for back-up and I experience this on all of them, so I feel like it most likely is a setting-related issue. I also thought it may be a feedback issue with my friend's mic, however, my echo is present even when I stream solo.   


Is there anyone who is familiar with this headset and has been able to get decent quality audio from it when streaming or partying up? Any tips would be hugely appreciated, as I have been frustrated with this for several months and have been unable to find any information on what may be happening.",3,1585253764,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fpirmk/headsetmic_echo_issues_help_greatly_appreciated/,PS4,0

She called the support but they didn't really help a lot and her dad has passed away so yeah that is also a problem..

&amp;#x200B;

The reason the support didn't help was because they asked if she accepted the agreement or something but she said her dad made the account and stuff so they told her she had no right over this account or something.. What can she do now because she wants to call them again tomorrow and hope for someone else to pick up and this time say she was the one that made the account.

Also i see a lot online about the backup codes but she never even knew she had 2 step verification since she never logged out",4,1585249198,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fphdvc/friend_does_not_have_access_to_2_step_verifaction/,PS4,2

fpfn7l,Lokain22,Warning: Avoid Pillars of Eternity 2 on consoles.,"Hey all. So after my PC took a dump I decided to pick up the recent release of the ultimate edition on my PS4 Pro. This has been the worst port of a game I have played since Batman on PC. I‚Äôll do a quick run through of the ridiculous issues I have run into that finally made me quit playing after 30 hours.

1: Absolutely terrible loading times. If you have an SSD installed on your console, you‚Äôll get frequent 25-40 second loading times. If you don‚Äôt? over a minute constantly. And if you run this on a base PS4 or Xbone.. it‚Äôs awful.

2: no enhanced console support. Versus Evil could have easily unlocked the framerate or provide a resolution bump but they didn‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt provide any options to take advantage of the extra power of the Xbone X and PS4Pro.  As with everything in this port the bare minimum of effort was made so no enhanced support.

3: Frequent crashes and corrupted saves. There are tons of annoying little bugs but the worst is the crashes and corrupted saves. They said they fixed these, they did not. on top of the random crashes there are specific things that cause this as well. Want to change ur party? crash.  Change ships? crash. Even switching gear can cause a crash. 

Worst of all, your game save can be corrupted easily. I kept 5 different saves to avoid this and even still I ended up losing 3 hours of progress from 4 of them being corrupted. I don‚Äôt know if anything specific triggers this but it happened.

This has been an awful experience. Without these issues and some enhanced console support this would be a fantastic game but that‚Äôs not what we got here. I will personally avoid any ports from VE in the future as they don‚Äôt seen to care. If you want to play this game it‚Äôs great on PC, I would recommend you completely avoid any console version.",40,1585243724,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fpfn7l/warning_avoid_pillars_of_eternity_2_on_consoles/,PS4,5

However, this has been happening at least once a day at this point and I recently purchased modern warfare and every other time I have to disconnect my PlayStation, so my controller can work again, modern warfare deletes itself and I have to download it again which is the biggest pain in the ass. Plus I‚Äôm also concerned about my database and external hard drive that keeps being put at risk every time I unplug my PS4 improperly. Has anyone else had this issue before? Do I need a brand new controller or do I have to pair it some way so it can stay connected to the PS4? Or is my PS4 just malfunctioning?

To me . having to pay to have access to online multiplayer is just anti-consumer . i have nothing against the PSN subscription but it's totally not worth it at all . and it's not even the price it's the service . you get ''free'' games every month . which is not true as you pay for them through the subscription and at most you could say that you get a discount on the games which total should be above 60 $ a year . cloud storage is kinda interesting but not worth the subscription . the discounts are cool but hey . i prefer buying the physical version . which leaves us with only one last aspect of the PSN : online multiplayer , we all know that people pay for the PSN solely for this and the rest is some extra to fill the blank on the paper . now what i fail to understand is why ? why do you force people to pay extra money while they already paid the full price of the game and their internet provider . and to top it all you stick it with other features that some people don't want but are forced to get because PSN is all about the whole pack . now you might say '' the money is needed for server maintenace and for optimal online experience"" . this is totally false . the servers are run by the game companies themselves and the online experience features what ? game chat and some basic features that steam offers for free since years ? you shouldn't shut up about this . and i suggest that they create different  tiers for PSN for ex : basic membership gives you online multiplayer + some other features while pro membership gives you online multiplayer + the rest of the PSN features ...etc . i mean dude people are playing any game they want ONLINE on pc paying only internet bills and the game itself .",65,1585237621,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fpdrir/how_are_you_guys_ok_with_paying_for_online/,PS4,0

I‚Äôve also found a difference if the game host has lower speeds if they are hosting only the game party and not the chat. 

I‚Äôve done the comparison over 7 days and nights of gaming (roughly 5 hours per day). Our group of 4 played all of the combinations over and over in all different game modes, including custom.

Between each game we did a speed test for each game party host both in the PS4 network settings and the game hosts laptop. 

The results show that the slower speed, as the game party host, regularly causes hit detection lag with 3 or higher members of the party. 

The results also show that, regardless of data speed, if the game host is also the chat host there is significantly more hit detection lag.

The benefit, on each kill cam, went to the opponent 90% of the time. It went to us when the opponent‚Äôs view glitched. 

These are the results we had been expecting, so no surprise. What was a surprise was how great the effect was.

fpc0my,LadyofSwords,Hey guys! I'm am Xbox Gamer and I just had a few thoughts and words to share with you all on the upcoming consoles!,"Hello everyone I hope you're all staying safe during these trying times!

TLDR; If you're having doubts about the Ps5 and are thinking of switching to Xbox just because of the specs comparison, don't. Stick to what YOU want and know that whichever console you get, you're going to be getting an amazing experience compared to current gen.

To begin I want to make it very clear that I am an Xbox and PC player. The PC part is obvious enough, but the reason I've chosen Xbox over PlayStation is actually because of the companies themselves, not over the actual consoles or exclusives or whatnot I usually see people saying. I've always been treated fairly and felt rewarded for being an Xbox Gamer, from random free gifts to support that has, for the better part of roughly 90% of my interactions with them, been very good to me. 

Well that's my initial reason, followed by the fact I've grown very accustomed and like the controller better now. But pushing that aside let's get on to what I really wanted to say.

I've been seeing a lot of misinformation, arguing, loss of Hope and many saying how PlayStation has made a huge mistake for the Ps5. While it's true that the Series X is more powerfull from a specs standpoint, just looking at the information we have, this shouldn't deter anyone who loves PlayStation. A lot of people doing realize that any gaps of power in-between won't be truly noticable unless you have both consoles side by side running at the exact same time with the same game always. This and the fact we haven't actually seen a physical example of the Ps5's performance, people are judging rather harshly. I keep seeing people on the Xbox Subreddit as well in real life ""hopping"" over to Xbox because ""PlayStation"" has let them down. The only reason it's letting you down is because you're letting it. Here's a few points I constantly see it being put down for and my thoughts:

1) Raw power: As I said above, unless you have a direct comparison, you won't truly understand the visual difference between them. Even then, preference and even your T.V. can affect your experience, and the fact is regardless of console, your experience will be better than right now.

2) Smaller Internal storage: Jesus guys really? The difference between 800gb and 1tb in this day in age one maybe two triple A titles. Right now I have 2tb of storage for my Xbox One and several games installed and I am around the 700 mark. I don't even play all the games installed and I'm sure as hell everyone complaining about this isn't playing over 30 games everyday constantly. You play 1, 2 maybe even 3 constantly, so pick and stop being greedy. 

3) Oh but the Ps5 is going to be faster!: While yes from a technical standpoint this seems true (again we haven't seen a direct comparison or a physical representation yet) the people clinging to this either way, good or bad, don't seem to understand either console is going to be much faster than we are used to with current gen. The few minor seconds to millisecond will again, not be noticable unless you're running them both side by side at the same time with the same game. Which let's face it, you're not. 

I guess the point I'm trying to make is, if you're having doubts about the Ps5 and are thinking about switching to Xbox, don't make it because of this reveal. Think about your experience with the company, the brand, your enjoyment with it. How comfortable you are with it. If you like the controller and aesthetic of the console and controller (when revealed). Don't let a stat sheet for die hard fans and super tech nerds affect what YOU want. These consoles are made for us to enjoy, not to fight over and switch just because on paper one seems better than the other.",2,1585231433,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fpc0my/hey_guys_im_am_xbox_gamer_and_i_just_had_a_few/,PS4,1

I've had a PS4 Pro and a PSN for about five years in the UK. I might be moving abroad to a different region in a few years, and I was wondering what to expect. I have a few questions and was wondering if anyone has done this... 

I know that for some reason PS doesn't let you change your PSN account country - but are there any workarounds? I don't want to lose all the PS+ games I've accumulated OR my cloud saves and DLC purchases. Do PS still region lock physical game copies or can I keep them? Additionally, is it feasible to keep the PS4 and just worry about changing the power cable out for the new country's power cable, or is it going to be a huge problem that it is in a different region/country?

Honestly I just want to do the easiest thing and selling stuff off only to buy it all back at a loss is something I want to avoid if possible. I also don't want to lose all the stuff I've paid for. I wish PS let you just change your account region like other game systems.",10,1585226498,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fpau2g/region_psn_country_questions_might_be_moving/,PS4,1

I used to buy every single sports title every single year and then I stopped. Now its either FIFA / PES and MLB. The rest to me, are just roster updates without any meaningful updates.

The Show IMO provides the best buck for quality. Its just so damn consistent and the ball physics are usually upgraded leading to diversity in plays.

Hows The Show this year? I dont dive into DD or Seasons, I usually just play Online Rated.

Anything meaningful or should I wait for a sale?

So I‚Äôm interested in changing my current PS4 slim HDD, to either an SSHD or SSD, mainly because some of the newer games I‚Äôve been playing take a fair while to load. I‚Äôve sort of narrowed it down to 2 options:

- Seagate Firecuda (SSHD)
- Samsung 860 QVO (SSD)

I know that the Firecuda would be substantially cheaper than the SSD, so I‚Äôm mainly wondering about people‚Äôs experiences with either of them, if the Firecuda made a significant enough difference to the stock HDD that it‚Äôs not worth going for a full SSD, etc.

fp7irg,joelkelevra90,I'm stuck in the safe mode loop,"So a couple of days ago my PS4 kept on booting in safe mode. Watched a ton of YouTube videos on fixes and tried every option in safe mode. All the 7 options and it doesn't seem to work.

When I tried the 7th option, I formatted the USB in exfat (tried it in FAT32 too) , downloaded the ps4 update file (1.1gb one), created a PS4 folder, added an ""UPDATE"" folder, I pasted that file in there and I started with option 7. Initialize system software (the reinstall one). After going through with that it gave me an error SU-41343-5 in which it said ""Cannot use this USB storage device. The PS4 does not support this file system. To use it with this format, you must format it to exfat, go to settings, device, USB storage device and select format as exFAT... SU-41343-5"" Now the problem is I've already formatted it into exFAT format and it's asking me again to do that. (So I can't even install a fresh system software) 

The only option that has seemed to work is if I go for option 6 which is initialize software and that works for a little bit of time, it takes me to the main screen and everything seems to work fine, I can download games, sign in on my ps4 account and everything but after one restart I'm stuck in the same loop. It boots up in safe mode and I'm again left with the same options.

It told me that my console had an issue and it needed to initialise the system....awesome. So I gave it a day to do that, fix up everything with the software. It also stated it needed to be reinstalled via a USB to bring it to 7.02. No biggie, I got it downloaded and installed the newest system data. Fast forward a whole day of the PS4 installing all my games and software. Things are working painfully slow. Games that loaded quickly now take numerous minutes to load up (such as a single fight in soul calibur) in addition to that, music will sometimes stop when it shouldn‚Äôt (despite other voices and noises in game continuing) and games that took longer now have an immense load time (like red dead 2). Pressing the PS button on my controller doesn‚Äôt respond for about 15 seconds if at all and the main system menu will freeze the console for a few seconds before it resumes. To top it all off, half of the games I‚Äôve tried redownloading and playing will crash mid game and say it is corrupted and needs to be reinstalled. I‚Äôve never experienced this issue before....

fp4wua,Kenway21,Can anyone tell the story of Death Stranding,"Please no ""just play the game"" because I don't own a ps4. This game got into my radar with the coronavirus=death stranding memes. I've look into it and it's very weird. What I got is the world is destroyed by the BTs(ghosts?) entering the world of the living, you rebuild America by delivering stuff, the afterlife definitely exists because ghosts are everywhere and no one wants to go out, rain that makes you age rapidly (even buildings?), dead bodies can cause massive explosion with contact with these ghosts (ISIS would love that lol), people that can teleport, Bridges is the government? and responsible for delivering goods? Beaches is the equivalent of purgatory?

For characters
Sam- is the protagonist using a a baby in a pod to see ghosts and cannot die but can still cause an explosion, again terrorists would love that ( I just have to take it as it is)
Amelie- the extinction entity also the president of America and she can trigger the extinction of humanity?
Cliff- All I know he's Hannibal Lecter
Die-hardman - the head of Bridges?
Deadman - also part of Bridges and the tech guy for Sam

fp4q4t,Primary_Programmer,$10 to whoever has a working solution! Urgently need help with error CE-36329-3 (Tried search bar and everything else online!),"Hi

I am going to keep this short. My PS4 (bought in 2014) crashes and turns off within 15-30 minutes of turning it on.

I've had this issue once before (Summer 2019) and I fixed it by moving outlets (I think the old outlet was not supplying enough power).

This time I around, I've tried:

* Cleaning the dust internally
* Using a different outlet in the house
* Taking it to repair man, was told they have no idea what the problem is and would reinstall the OS for $200 (lol)
* Rebuilding database
* Initializing 
* Initializing with USB (reinstalling the OS)
* Swapping HDD with one I had in my laptop and initializing that with USB (the first time upon boot it actually stayed on for like an hour then died, but subsequent turn ons died within 15-30 minutes like before)

Right now I am waiting for a new SSHD (firecuda) to show up and I'm gonna give that one last try.  I don't want to send it off for repairs because that's like $200+tax right there and I don't want to buy a new one because the PS5 is coming very soon. 

Any suggestions on what the problem could be? I was wondering that it may be power related somehow - I like tinkering with electronics so I am down to open it and swap parts and stuff like that.

Please help, I'd really appreciate it.",17,1585194740,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fp4q4t/10_to_whoever_has_a_working_solution_urgently/,PS4,1

fp4nkm,eminemkh,Red flickering with Samsung 55 TV When Resolution Goes Up,"Hey All,

Previously using a Soniq TV with a Sony HDMI cable which works at 1080p.

Now I have a Samsung 55inch TV. When I try to use the old cable, it only gives Audio but no Video.

Bought a new one and tried. Now the TV shows from 480p. When I turn up the resolution, it starts to flicker and red lines and dots shows in some colour like purple.

Does anyone knows why this happens? Is it because of the cable or just the TV HDMI port? I tried to test with my Chromecast and it works just fine.. 

I can still play with 720p but it sucks with a better TV but lower quality.

When i've been reading on these types of messages again, i've found one that said someone's account could be part of a botnet, or my account has been compromised.

Now, the only thing i could think of that could have compromised my account was when i tried to sign in with Playstation for some illegitimate Rocket League prices site back when i used to trade on that game. After i realised i had probably given my account details to some random site, i immediately changed my details. 

I've had these types of messages for years before then though, so i'm quite confused as to the workings behind these bots.

And yes, i've deleted the message and reported and blocked the account already.

Though sadly It looks like I‚Äôll be here for at least two more weeks before I‚Äôll be able to go back home, and I‚Äôm really bored and I really wanna play some games so The first thing i thought of was remote play, even but I quickly found out that you need a tv in order to set that up but the last post I‚Äôve see  on this was three years ago so I‚Äôm wondering if there has been any updates or anyway I can play on my phone without setting things up on a tv first. 

Guys please I need your help you can tell how DESPERATE I am, I wanna play even if it‚Äôs on my damn iphone screen.

Please save me for the next two weeks from pain inducing boredom. Any help would be appreciated :)

fovrk8,DanCTapirson,LPT: Connect directly to your PS4 when using remote play on the Vita for better and more stable connection.,"Most of you probably know this, but if you connect directly to your PS4 wifi instead of going though your home WiFi, you'll have a better and more stable connection (assuming you're relatively close to your PS4) and the added benefit is you free up data on your home connection. 

In order to do this, go into the PS4 Settings&gt; Remote Play Connection Settings&gt; Enable Remote Play&gt; Connect Directly with PS Vita/PS TV

Now, in order to make sure the PS Vita is REALLY connecting directly to the PS4, you MUST DELETE your Home wifi from the Vita network settings, otherwise the PS Vita will try to use it and if it can connect to it first, it won't connect directly to the PS4. I just discovered this today and the difference in quality and stability is way better now.

Sad but I never got a chance to play.

I never really played a narrative based game.

I watch them a lot but never really got to ""experience"" one.

Hi! I'm Riad (riadd), co-founder of Maschinen-Mensch, an independent game studio based in Berlin. Curious Expedition, our roguelike simulation game set in the 19th century is arriving on PS4 on March 31st. Together with famous personalities players will venture on unprecedented expeditions to regions never before explored in search of fame, science and treasures in a procedurally generated world full of wonder and mystery. The game has been available on PC for some time, where it received more than 50 updates. We're really thrilled for PS4 players to experience the ""ultimate edition"" of the game!At the moment we're busy developing Curious Expedition 2 (currently in closed alpha), and alongside that we're also working on Codecks, a project management tool for game developers.Before starting Maschinen-Mensch with my co-founder Johannes in 2014, we both worked in AAA, most famously on the game ""Spec Ops: The Line"" by YAGER Development.Feel free to ask me anything about the original Curious Expedition, it's sequel, moving from AAA to indie, starting your own studio, project management in game development, procedurally generated storytelling, HTML5 game development, game jams...Here's some links to find out more about the game.

So i found about a inch worth of dust buildup on the end of the heatsink thing after taking it apart

My ps4 now runs almost dead quiet... This is going to sound dumb but is this how its suppose to sound? I cant even remember the last time it didnt sound like a jet taking off , and i never had a ""too hot"" message before

The fan is running but its just so much more quiet now, feels like i both fixed it and broke it

foktxk,Aquarium-Luxor,Unpopular opinion: Sony should make a Warhawk successor or similar game for the PS4 asap.,"It has been a big mistake for Sony not to make a game sequel to Warhawk (PS3) for the Playstation 4 or even a similar kind of game. For those that played Warhawk, you already know what this is about. For those that missed this unique gaming experience, Warhawk was an online multiplayer third person shooter tactics &amp; strategy combined arms wargame.

The game was set in a WW2 Europe inspired continent divided between the Eucadian Republic and the Chernovan Empire. In the big maps it had (some had multiple cities) , there was a heavy influence of retrofuturist elements and diesel punk aesthetics which looked beautiful on its own and was awesome to explore and fight in.

You spawned as a foot soldier at your military capital without any guns or equipment like all players and then It was up to you. You could either look for weapons to go fight on foot, you could take an armored personnel carrier or a lighter armored hummer with a small squad and scout ahead, or become a tank commander and go with a column of other panzers to break up the frontlines or provide defense support to a friendly sector. You could also ride the top tank turret while a driver went ahead. Armed with an RPG you could act as a vital AA mobile station. Yet even the all powerful panzer columns needed squads and air support to advance or they would just be moving ducks waiting to be busted by a javelin or ground to ground turret fire systems. 

You also had these huge flying zeppelins armed with multiple powerful cannons and could act as a sky fortress around which dogfights would rage on. Yeah, dogfights. This was the whole point of the game : the planes, better reserved for the elite players who could dogfight like the aces of the world wars. These were incredibly difficult to master and very important to deploy to coordinate a campaign of air superiority which without no side could ever hoped to advance in the front lines and make a breakthrough. Yet even if you had the best pilots, if your boots on the ground were not fighting the good fight, you could not win no matter how many sorties and bombs you dropped in the enemy, especially as operating missile turret and AA flak guns shot at you and would keep you at bay.

And this was the sublime beauty of Warhawk. You could play however you wanted to wage war, as a soldier, pilot or mechanized cavalry and it all had a perfect balance because of it. The more integrated the style of combined arms warfare, the higher chances for your side to take victory. And it all happened in epic battlegrounds. You couldn't have asked for more.

This game was really ahread of its time, was one of the best online games Sony had and it would be a killer game if they brought it back on the Playstation 4 as a new title, reskinmed and upgraded or just straight up port/original on the PS4 play store. This game was really a jewel and one of the best online experiences of all time, no hyperbole. Another plus, the Warhawk players were the gold standard for an online community. Really great bunch and great gamers all around.

I have a problem with playing online games on my ps4, when playing rocket league my ping is usually low (around 20-35) until suddenly I get a huge spike and packet loss for around 30 seconds at a time.
This happens multiple times per game.
Also when I am playing any single player game or just idling it gives me a LAN cable not connected message.
When I test my internet on my ps4 it usually says around 35mbps download, sometimes it dips to around 10 very fast, within minutes or seconds.

On my other devices I have it does not do this (although I don‚Äôt do gaming on my other devices and just browsing and work), I am using a internet bridge or router from my main modem using a LAN cable
It‚Äôs only a few rooms apart from the main modem, I have used multiple LAN cables in case it‚Äôs broken but it still does it.

Could it be the distance from the main modem or just everyone is working from home and using bandwidth in my neighbourhood? When I had my ps4 hooked up to my main router getting the internet signal and not the using the bridge it didn‚Äôt do this.

I just got a new SSD for my ps4 pro. I don't have plus so I backed up my save data and switched them out, installed the OS and restored the backup. Everything went ok, but when I try to load my save from the game I was playing (Tales of Bersia) it gives me an error ""unable to load save data. An error occurred when accessing the add ons""

I had 5 free add ons that gave items that came with the game and 5 catalogue items to show costumes. Nothing bought, and all 10 show installed on the device.(I will note the catalogue ones do show? For the icon when you check the list, but I am not sure if that's normal because they set up no icon or an issue. However I also can't vew the catalogue skits either) 

I've uninstalled and reinstalled, rebooted with no change. I looked for a way to uninstall just add ons and install again but I found nothing. Does anyone have any idea what I can do?

Not only was the audio stuttering and cutting out at times, but my game started lagging like crazy as well, as if the wifi signal had suddenly gotten really weak. I switched off the headset and started using my normal wired earphones and the problems immediately went away. Tested a couple more times and the same issues kept occurring when using the wireless headset. Audio kept cutting out and game was lagging really badly.

Has anyone experienced these issues before when using the headset? If so, how did you fix the problem?

fofy46,Jigginsgunn,"Witcher 3 System Freeze, hard reset, issues","I was playing Witcher 3 on my PS4 Pro, I had hopped back to main screen for about 5 minutes, when I came back the whole system had froze. 

I tried soft resetting but it was stuck. So I removed the power cord, waited 10 seconds, then turned it back on. 

I repaired my external Western Digital HD extended storage drive (2TB). When I went to start the Witcher again, the screen became crazy with blinking artifacts. 

I quit and restart, same thing. Tried COD Warzone and Division 2, same weird artifacts.

If I just press the PS button once, home screen is artifacty too, until I force quit the game and the home screen goes back to normal. 

Other games on the external hard drive are fine, and on internal storage they are fine too. 

I deleted and reinstalled the games, same issue whether I re-install them on the internal or external HD. 

Went to settings and changed the boost mode from on to off, disabled hdmi link, hdcp, no luck. 

Any advice? Thanks in advance 

TL;DR Witcher 3 froze PS4 pro. Disconnected from power. Repaired HD successfully, system fine, game won‚Äôt play without artifacts.",0,1585093436,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fofy46/witcher_3_system_freeze_hard_reset_issues/,PS4,1

Trying to use the BT Extender 500 to connect my PS4 to the internet using a wire. It used to work a long time ago but did eventually stop, for no apparent reason. Both are connected together again. But when I try to connect it doesn't work out for me. I either cannot connect to the server within the time limit, or I have an issue with DNS.

I tried connecting it to my computer and initially it came up as an Unidentified Network and could not find an IP address, but eventually after fiddling about on the admin page worked. However, this did not fix the PlayStation issue.

I've done a lot of playing about with my Tenda router in an attempt to bypass NAT restrictions from my PS4 which could be the cause of all this. Any advice on what to look at on the router? It worked earlier for a few minutes but connection was shabby and died after a restart- as well as adding the IP address to the DMZ and binding the PS4 to it's IP address.

foem57,PlayPratz,PS4 Shutting off randomly,"So a week ago, there was an electric problem (most likely a voltage spike) at my house which broke a few chargers and my PS4. There was this oil leaking from the PS4. When I tried to turn it on, the LED strip would turn blue for a second and then the PS4 would shut off. Took it to Sony but here in India, there's no repairs, only replacements. They were charging almost the same as a new PS4 to get this one replaced.

I got the PSU changed locally and was convinced that the issue is resolved. But now, the PS4 shuts off abruptly after 5-10 minutes of operation. And once it shuts off, it replicates the behaviour which I had mentioned above (blue light for a second). However, if I disconnect it from the power socket for about 2 hours, I can play for 10 minutes again. It has come to my notice that the longer I keep it disconnected, the longer I can play. It's been in rest mode for a day now with no problems.

After like 40 minutes of frantic googling hoping that my PS4 wasn‚Äôt fucked I saw a reddit comment saying how some PS4 PSU‚Äôs have a problem where they simply don‚Äôt work under heat (i dont know the average limit exactly but i know that mine works fine when my house reaches 80 degrees in the summer when the AC is off or when reaching max performance and power consumption, so its not too bad in my case and i can continue to use my console without sending it for repairs)

So I realized that part of it was in direct sunlight and turned the car AC up to full blast and put the PS4 in front of it and lo and behold it turned completely on and completely booted up to the menu before i turned it back off. So if anyone‚Äôs PS4 wont turn on and you think it may be under some kind of directed external heat like sunlight, try cooling it off and see if it turns on.

TLDR: if your ps4 wont turn on and you think it may be affected by a heat source try cooling it down with a fan or something and see if it works. If it does you have a PSU issue.",0,1585088299,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/foehdy/if_anyones_ps4_beeps_once_and_then_turns_off_and/,PS4,1

foefge,whatupscott,Audio Issues with brand new DualShock 4,"I bought a brand new DualShock 4 controller at the weekend and plugged my headset into it using the audio jack tonight to use it for the first time. The issue I have is that the audio that comes through the headset is mostly a load of static, I can still hear game sounds and party chat voices but accompanying them is static that is very high pitched and constant. The controller itself works fine, buttons etc. all good and there‚Äôs no superficial damage to the unit either.

So far, I‚Äôve tried resetting the controller multiple times, disconnecting and reconnecting the controller, turning off all WiFi and other wireless technologies in my house. Nothing seems to clear it up. I‚Äôve also tried the obvious checks like using another headset in the controller - same static noise produced and plugging my headset into another controller - no issues. I‚Äôve had this headset for nearly a year and had no problems until I used this new controller. 

Only thing I can think of is this is my first 3rd gen DualShock 4 and I‚Äôve previously been using 2nd gens but I know my friends use this exact headset (Razer Kraken) with 3rd gen controllers and haven‚Äôt had this.

Has anyone else experienced this and fixed it or have any ideas what else I could try?",0,1585088111,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/foefge/audio_issues_with_brand_new_dualshock_4/,PS4,1

Yes, I have the latest update (7.02). Yes, the PS4 can connect to the internet. I mean, it downloaded the newest ad for the PS Store, but I couldn't even buy anything there, \`cause it won't login. I changed my password through my PC, something I'd read worked for other people. No dice. When I try to login, if I enter the wrong password, the server will spit it back to me as being wrong. The correct pw gets me to the Please Wait and Error screens.

I was able to successfully create new account on the PS4. Luckily(\*), it too would not connect.

I can't get it to boot into safemode, because it won't recognize a controller that is plugged into it.

My internet is through HughesNet (I know that is part of the problem) but I've never had a problem before.

When I get my portable drive back tonight, I'm guess I'll reinitialize the whole thing. I'm just pissed I'll lose like 3 months worth of Trophies.

I signed on my PS4 account and randomly all of my games appear to be locked. I googled help for this and the common theme seems to be I must activate the PS4 as my primary and then restore game licenses.

However, when I attempt to this this I‚Äôm unable to activate as it says another device is my primary device. This is crazy because I don‚Äôt share games and I‚Äôve never had another ps4 so I don‚Äôt understand how this can be. The error message refers me to Sonys website where it claims I can deactivate this phantom device there but even then I receive a message saying you can only do this once per 6 months and it claims I‚Äôve already used my one chance.

Now I‚Äôm stuck and since I download all my games the ps4 is useless.

Has this ever happened to anyone? Any advice or recommendations? I tried contacting support but they say they have limited staff and cannot help me. Is my PlayStation gone forever????

Help meee!! Thank you",4,1585078606,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fobiyw/need_help_all_my_games_have_become_locked/,PS4,1
fobha2,OliverPete,Lagging PS4 - Have Tried Multiple Solutions,"Hello,

Prelude: I bought this system in October, 2018. Sony's customer support is not up for obvious reasons. I filled in their online diagnostic and they recommend sending my PS4 in for repairs (estimated $110 charge) and I would not get it back for quite a while due to the timing of the virus.

Issue: Friday I was playing Apex Legends and my PS4 began lagging. I assumed it was the servers and quit the game. My PS4 was still lagging even on the home screen. I turned it off, unplugged it, and left it unplugged until Saturday morning.

Saturday morning it would not turn on except in safe mode. That day I tried to (in order):

* Update System Settings with Internet and then Disc
   * Got an error message that storage could not be reached both times (forgot to write it down)
* Restored Default Settings
* Rebuild Database (7.02)
   * Got error code CE-41813-7
* Initialize PS4 via Internet and then Disk (7.02)
   * Got error code CE-36329-3
* Initialize PS4 (Reinstall System) via Internet (7.02)

Wiping the system and reinstalling it did not get an error. My PS4 restarted and I thought everything was ok. I started downloading my games. It worked great for about 20 minutes and then began lagging.  Now, every time I turn it on it works great for about 20 minutes and then begins to lag. The lagging gets worse the longer the system is on, even if it is just sitting idle, eventually getting to the point that you can see the home screen animation jumping from position to position.

Is there a way to fix this or do I need to buck up and spend the money and not have my PS4 during my entire quarantine?",1,1585078453,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fobha2/lagging_ps4_have_tried_multiple_solutions/,PS4,1

fo9bd8,AlanRaptor,"Looking To Get Back Into Gaming And Need Some Advice / Recommendations (Slim vs Pro, etc...)","Hey, hopefully this kind of post is allowed! The last console I've personally owned is a PS2 when I was younger so it's been a long while since I've been in the market. With being stuck at home lately I've decided it's the perfect time to get back into some casual gaming. I've settled on the PlayStation for the exclusive titles as I'll mostly be playing singleplayer anyway.

So my question is I'm not sure if it's worth it to pay the little extra for the Pro or just go for the Slim? I'm planning on buying a budget 4K TV as well if I can find one for a decent price. I've read good things about the TCL models on here and was eyeing one of those. My total budget would be around $700 total ideally. I also know the PS5 is coming later this year but I don't really want to wait that long to start playing. My main concern with jumping into buying a console now is that it won't be supported after the 5 is released and I'm hoping to get at least a good 6-8 years out of it if I can. 

Anyway hopefully that was more coherent than it sounded in my head. I'm open to any suggestions and advice as gaming has changed a lot since I've last personally owned anything.",5,1585071584,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fo9bd8/looking_to_get_back_into_gaming_and_need_some/,PS4,1

fo92p8,d3f3nd3r89,Resident Evil 3 - My Experience,"Now listen I consider myself to be a huge fan of the original resident evil 3, I mean the multiple choice scenario's, weapon mod drops, multiple endings, alternate character, mercenaries mode with unlockables!

1999 resident evil 3 was huge back in its heyday, I personally don't recall ever seeing anything even remotely like it as far as how much it had to offer for it to be on ps1. My only fault was wanting to play through on easy mode for the increased ammo/weapons and a sense of safety as I enjoyed the story.

I remember at 10 I could hardly make it through, never quite getting the hang of the dodge, freaking out at the thought of just a handgun on hard mode, wasting tons of ammo. It wasn't very long before I started getting decent enough to trudge through it though and I had it for quite some time but I just couldn't see the mechanics as well as I do now so I played it solely for fun without developing a vast amount of skill.

I just bought it again from video game cavern last year and felt the need to beat it at its best just for old times sake and my own sense of respect ya know. I was ecstatic to find the shotgun in the alley after I started hard mode, i figured it was my only shot at taking on nemesis at that point. It was a somewhat rough transition when the nemesis first came in at RPD, I mustve died atleast 15 - 20 times before finally getting hold of the dodge mechanic fluently enough to stand a chance. It mustve took around 40 rounds of handgun ammo and 8 shells atleast to be able to drop him both times.

I could've simply ran past some of his attacks but Id rather not do that and just rely on my dodge so I can always depend on it in case he ever does actually get me in a pinch.

I had the urge to try and collect as many weapons parts as I could because back when I was 10 I always fantasized about being able to acquire one but I was never quite good enough to last in order to get it. 

2nd Form Nemesis in the clocktower courtyard was the biggest challenge for me, that's when he got increased mobility, starts swiping with his tentacles, stabbing you with poison spikes. Im very excited to see how Capcom tries to incorporate different techniques into nemesis' fighting style to make him more deadly in the new remake.

The final fight was nothing and the one before that with the acid tank valves was about as difficult as the first, not quite because he doesn't run very much so you got a chance with the valves. Im sad to hear they wont be bringing back mercenaries but I wouldn't be surprised if it were included in some future dlc.

I ended up finishing hard mode for the first time while missing just one modification from where I think I had to push nemesis from the bridge into the water before I got to the plant just from lack of ammo.

Im still curious what the purpose of the magnum ammo is in the RE3 demo tho. I found the zombies actually harder to dodge than the nemesis in some cases because of his charge up time compared to how the zombies just lunge at you really fast and leave you less time to react.

The Nemesis (atleast if he isn't getting beefed up in the final product) seemed to be way too easy to take down. He caught me surprised with 3rd combo punch cause it was just a quick spin but after that I had no trouble dodging him like 4 times on average up to a max of like 10 - 12 over a few hours.

He takes very little ammo to take down compared to his counterpart in my opinion despite the fact its only standard mode. I mean really he only takes like half a clip and maybe a shotgun round to take down, just dodge him twice and you got him. Plus 

Headshots on nemesis do seem to take much longer, the bullets literally seeming to bounce off his cranium while chest shots with bullet time leaves him so open to attack the only thing that kept me playing for a few hours was seeing how many times I could down him without dying.

I kind of expected him to be a bullet sponge but he seems like kind of a creampuff with the fact you can easily take him down 6 - 8 times without much trouble, a few times I was able to one shot the nemesis with the handgun while he was in a full sprint and make him drop with a few previous shots while he was down just before that but still.

This game definitely seems to be geared slightly more toward a younger generational audience in my opinion just from how overpowered jill seems with the bullet time and how the zombies feel just a little less spongy too based on their standard resistance in RE2 remake. Though im sure nemesis' future forms will only further empower the experience along with hardcore.

Although its not was deadly as I would have hoped I think it definitely delivers with compelling story, awesome visuals, fleshed out characters and a vastly broadened playing field and I cant wait to see where it goes :D",5,1585070797,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fo92p8/resident_evil_3_my_experience/,PS4,1

fo88x3,ThatLastGenGamer,Doom Eternal is THE reason to buy the Back Button Attachment.,"Seriously. I loved Doom 2016 and was very excited to start Eternal, now with the ""extra"" inputs. After a couple of hours playing on Ultra Violence, I realised that the attachment isn't just a nice feature to have for this, it's become a necessity.
Doom Eternal is the first game that I can remember which has so many real-time combat possibilities and at such a blistering pace that I actually NEED to have all my fingers available to instantly press the most important commands. The custom button-maping is a godsend for this purpose and I ended up settling with the left paddle for jumping and the right one for the weapon wheel.

I can now fully understand why so many reviewers are considering this game to be ""too much"" without a mouse and keyboard. Without the attachment, I think I'd feel the same.",13,1585068106,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fo88x3/doom_eternal_is_the_reason_to_buy_the_back_button/,PS4,1
fo85ap,Dota2TradeAccount,DAYS GONE completely went under my radar! I bought it in the latest sale out of boredom and so far I may have invested around 40hrs,"I initially looked forward to it very much, but when the reviews came in I second guessed it. I have to say I'm a very picky gamer and 'okayish' games are nothing I want to spend my time with.

Because there were no other options and it was in the sale, I gave it a try.

First hour in I felt confirmed that this game was mediocre at best ‚Äì wonky controls, a few bugs here and there and not too interesting of a story. But I made the wise decision to play it on the highest difficulty and then it happened. I realized that these zombies ‚Äì or freakers ‚Äì are dangerous *af*.

I simply cannot remember when a game made me jump out of my chair the last time as when I attracted a group of six freakers that I was unable to handle at the early stages of the game and ran to my bike, only to get on there in the exact second the first freaker reached me and leashed out. That world is *menacing*.

And then you begin to slowly appreciate the story and the characters. And then you get hold of the shooting and melee mechanics and feel rewarded. And then you run into your first horde ‚Äì at dawn, in the rain, or fog, or in a dark cave. And then you realize that the map is way bigger than you initially thought. And all this time here and there you've already been thinking ‚ÄûJesus Christ this is one of the best looking games I've ever played.""

For anyone having doubts: Do it. I think DAYS GONE is severly underrated and it deserves more praise. No it isn't perfect. But it's neither mediocre. It's amazing. Thanks.",92,1585067748,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fo85ap/days_gone_completely_went_under_my_radar_i_bought/,PS4,1

fo6tyk,productoffallout,Are you seriously telling me that you can get banned for something you didn't do because 2 or 3 people report you on multiple accounts and nothing can be done?,"This has got to be the not only worst punishment system but worst support for any company as big as Sony. 

Now I will admit if I had gotten banned for a week for harassment or vulgar language I would understand. When I was a kid I wanted to be a lawyer or a detective as I like to argue and figure things out. So I will admit I spend a little bit of time in a gameshare community and shit talk scammers. 

I guess a few of the scammers got tired of getting called out or put on blast by me so they all reported me as well as with all of their alts for ""sharing account information"" which I did not do as I am not trying to game share. 

No one has access to my account but me so I know no one posted anything without my permission. 

So since I never shared account information nor asked anyone for account information that means the only plausible explanation for me getting banned is due to a group of people, who definitely deserve to be banned more than I do, abusing the report feature and getting me automatically banned without a human review. 

It's only a week and I really do not care about the account and I am not even really arguing whether or not I deserved a ban but I definitely did not deserve a ban for the reason I was banned as I didn't share my information with anyone. It's just the principle that bans can be automated without human review and Sony refuses to have any system in place to help those banned due to report abusers. 

In a 24 hour period I got not only banned but had a forced name change so it is clear I am being report targeted. 

Do you really mean to tell me that if you get banned due to report abuse under false pretenses due to an automated system that nothing can be done? What a joke. 

**tl;dr** got banned for a week because a few scammers mass reported me for ""sharing account information"" which I didn't do. Even though the ban was under false pretenses because I never shared account information and thus clearly automated Sony's joke of a customer support refuses to even look at my case.",35,1585063214,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fo6tyk/are_you_seriously_telling_me_that_you_can_get/,PS4,1

I'm looking for a comfortable headset that allows me to chat clearly but also have great sound quality.

I also just learned that sidetone is a thing in headsets so I've narrowed it down to the following three, but open to more:  


Steel Series Arctis 7 Wireless  
HyperX Cloud Flights  
PlayStation Gold Wireless (I know folks either love or hate these)  


**Must haves**

\- Wireless  
\- Sidetone on PS4  
\- Good-Decent mic  
\- Chat mix would be nice, but I know thats rare unless there's a DAC  
\- Comfortable

Apologies if this isn't the right forum to ask, but I have a technical problem. For a recent birthday, I received the Bioshock collection remaster. I popped in Disc 1 and it seems to *play* but there is a constant and rhythmic whirring and stopping - whirring and stopping. I checked the disc, no scratches, cleaned it. And popped in Disc 2. No sounds or issues at all. Disc 1 again, same incessant noise. Is this a common problem with these discs? Should I let it run its course? Do I go for the exchange and receive a new disc?

fo5wnj,kleinicorn,Sekiro and Bloodborne,"I've been playing Sekiro a lot this past week and I have to say it might be one of my favorite games of this generation. I am not good at soulsborne games(or at least I thought I wasn't) but in Sekiro it seems like everything feels earned. I've struggled on a few boss fights(Lady Butterfly and Guardian Ape), but for the most part I can progress fairly well. I appreciate the use of the prosthetic tool without too much customization so I can focus on getting my ass kicked a few times instead of sorting through  a loot system. Personally I think it is much better than Bloodborne. Maybe Bloodborne was really difficult for me because it was my intro into Fromsoftware, but I definitely have some nitpicks with the game. Save points can sometimes be brutal as it can take you 10 minutes to get back to a boss fight which is flat out annoying. I know a lot of people appreciate the Lovecraftian setting, but when I die 30 times it feels overly oppressive and dark and makes me enjoy the game less.  I got through about half of this game before putting it down. I'm about 3/4 of the way through Sekiro(about to fight the GS Owl) and I have no intention of putting it down(but I probably will if I die 1000 times in these last few boss fights). Anyways just thought I would share my thoughts on the contrasts between the two and have a discussion on why I feel so different about both games.",15,1585059720,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fo5wnj/sekiro_and_bloodborne/,PS4,1

First time here on this community, i hope i posted the question on the right place (couldn't find any megathread or similar).

&amp;#x200B;

As many others i've been stuck home in quarantine for a while and since my sister recently got a ps4 of her own i wanted to share my ps plus titles with her.

Can someone explain to me how to do it?

I've seen some stuffs about a primary and secondary console, but i can't really get what are the secondary console limitations.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now i have a white ps4 pro (my console, now primary with only my psplus account) and a black ps4, where i want to connect my account but let her access the games with her personal local account, so we don't share savegames.

To do so should i set her console as secondary?

Or only primary consoles can share games with others local accounts?

If so, what are the limitations to have my own ps4 set up as secondary? Can i still play online my games and stuffs?

I'm not planning to use the same games on both console at the same time obviously, just sharing the psplus library, kinda similar to how steam does it.

I have a technical problem which I cannot seem to solve. See: I bought my PS4 last year, already have a big collection of physical games but also want to try out some of the smaller titles in the store (as well as maybe get some PSN membership). But for some reason the PS store just does not let me register.

Now: I am from Germany. We are supposed to verify our identity by entering our passport-ID-number-thingie. But for one reason or another whenever I try the PS store just responds: ""Cannot verify this number. Try to enter it again."" I have done it so many times now, I am 100% sure, that I used the right number. But still: It will not let me register and hence I cannot buy anything in the store.

I tried to contact the support several times and never got a reply.

Just bought a PS4 pro yesterday. Last console I owned was a PS2 way back in the Victorian age.

Been on pc games for a long time but the GF had a PS3 and I eventually came to love that 'sit back on the couch' vibe. 

Also playing games together is so much fun.

Because Iv been away from the console scene for so long it all seems so new. A bit out of touch with what good games are out there.

We are looking for some fun 2 player games to play together. We been playing borderlands 2 on her ps3 for a while. Really enjoying it. Will eventually get 3 on PS4 when we done with 2.

But for time being we fancy trying some other stuff too.

She suggested binding of Isaac. Not sure which one though for 2 player PS4.

My brother also suggested portal 2.

This has happened about 5 times. If i download the update the PS4 initialises. If I go into safe mode and try literally every other option there, the PS4 restarts and the same black screen comes up. I was considering getting an external hard drive to back up all my data from my games so when I inevitably do have to initialise I won't have to reinstall everything and lose all my progress.

I've tried switching my router exclusively to 5GHz and even turning it completely off, yet the issue persists. I've even tried initializing my PS4 and yet the issue is still present after that whole process.

Is there a way to use your controller with a USB cord? When I plug in my controller, it still seems to be communicating via bluetooth and I cannot locate a setting to switch it to wired only. I'd like to do this to rule out the fact that there is interference between my controller and PS4. 

Any other advice on troubleshooting would be helpful. I'm fearful this is my HDD or processor for the PS4, but I'd like other suggestions on how I can narrow this down further.

1. Reply to this post with a game you'd like to see have its own discussion thread stickied at the top of the subreddit this week.

2. Vote for other games in the comments you'd like to see as well.

3. The top ~2-ish games will be given a game thread this week as well as one other game at random from the suggestions.

**Rules:**

1. One game per top-level comment.  It will otherwise be ignored.

2. The game must be released and available to play on PS4.  However, it doesn't matter how old it is.

3. Try to **avoid duplicates** as they tend to dilute the voting.  If the top two comments are the same game, it will still only get one thread for the week.

To view all recent game threads, [**click here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/search?q=flair%3A%22game+thread%22&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all).  To view a specific game's discussion thread(s), search for the game's name on the **/r/PS4/w/games** wiki (CTRL+F) and click the discussion icon next to the title.

My ps4 is basically crap. This started about 5 months ago, a cycle of me playing normally, all my games being slightly laggy for a day and I'd turn it on the next day and a black screen would come up telling me to download software update 7.02 onto a memory stick from [playstation.com](https://playstation.com) and use it to do the update. This has happened about 5 times. If i download the update the PS4 initialises. If I go into safe mode and try literally every other option there, the PS4 restarts and the same black screen comes up. I was considering getting an external hard drive to back up all my data from my games so when I inevitably do have to initialise I won't have to reinstall everything and lose all my progress.

fo0sxe,ChorizoBlanco,PS4 Pro - Static on TV and high temperature when using Youtube app,"Yesterday, my cousin was playing FIFA on my PS4 Pro and after like an 8 hour session, suddenly my TV had only static in its screen, like that black and white static old TVs had and the console was very hot (tho it didn't turn off itself like it should if it has a heating problem). I turned it off using the console's button and waited for 30 mins. After that, it turned on just fine but left it turned off. 

Today I removed the top cover and cleaned the fan (it was dusty). The console is working fine for now but I don't dare playing a game for more than 1h just in case. Could heat have caused the static?

What seems weird is that the PS4 gets kinda hot even while only having the YouTube app opened. Is that normal behavior for the YouTube app? Btw, I plugged it in without the cover to check if the fan was working and it does, it blows heat towards the back of the console just fine I guess. I know it can get hot while playing games, but YouTube?

The way I had them set up was that it was wired to be powered from the ps4 and receive tv/game audio from my TV's Audio Out on the back via red and white audio cables which connected to my headset from a long wire. Then there was a seperate chat audio that would plug into the ps4 controller from there to only receive chat audio.

fnyhhr,_PettyTheft,If I back up my main PS4 hard drive will my external work,"Will I just be able to plug in my external drive and have access to all the games I currently have on it after a restore.

After installing the Sims 4 twice my PS4 has been crashing constantly and the only way to get it to boot is by installing the update in safemode‚Äîat which point it will work until powered down or it powers itself off. 

I was trying to move my Sims 4 install from external to internal just now and with 3 seconds remaining the system just powered off.

Now I‚Äôm reinstalling the OS update in safe-mode again. Rebuilding the database doesn‚Äôt work. It goes to a black screen and eventually just powers off. When I power it back on I get the PS4 logo and then a black screen and flashing blue light. 

I‚Äôve never had any problems with any other games.  

Even if I initialize my system and restore it from a backup, couldn‚Äôt the problem just come back b/c of a fault in the backup?",0,1585022403,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fnyhhr/if_i_back_up_my_main_ps4_hard_drive_will_my/,PS4,1

fnybxy,ShadowOphion,External Hard Drive Issue,"On Friday, I started downloading Modern Warfare. My internet is notoriously slow, so I knew no matter what it was going to take anywhere from 5 hours in rest mode to a full day. I decided to play some other stuff in the meantime. Last night, it still wasn't done downloading, but it was about 1 GB away from finishing so I decided to leave it in rest mode and check when I woke up. When I did, it reverted back to 92 GB from 98 GB. I thought maybe it was the external hard drive, it's been acting up the past few weeks. I decided to put it in rest mode again. When I went to put it in rest mode, it was frozen on the ""Entering Rest Mode"" screen. After 20 minutes, I unplugged the external hard drive first and then the PS4. Plugged them both back in and now, not only does the system keep saying the HDD needs to be repaired, but whenever it does repair it keeps stuttering the console until it eventually crashes. I've reformated the HDD, I've ran diagnostics on it using a computer and it reads it fine, and I fully reinitialized my PS4. It seems to be handling it a lot better now, but there's still some small freezes every now and again when I try to navigate the console's dashboard or quick menu and when I put the system into rest mode, it still said the HDD was damaged. I can't tell if it's the console because without the HDD, it seems to perform fine, or the HDD cause it can still be read just fine on a computer as far as I can tell.",0,1585021679,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fnybxy/external_hard_drive_issue/,PS4,1

I recently bought a DS4 controller to play via Playstation -Now on my PC. unfortunately I cant get my controller to work. Here are some of the symptoms:

When I try to connect using a USB cable, the controller flashes bright blue and sometimes the controller actually works in the ps now client and even in games... for about 10 seconds. After that the light turns solid dark blue and it no input is parsed. However, the controller is still recognized by windows and the PSNow client.

If I try to connect via Bluetooth the pairing seems to work normally but as soon as it is done, the controller seems to input random button presses making the pc practically unusable.

in DS4Windows the controller is recognized without a problem and the controls seem to work just fine.

 It also doesnt help that sony shut down its forums 1 month ago. 

I am at my wits end and would greatly appreciate help, especially since there now is an official shelter in place order out and im bored as shit.

fnttw7,alysinunderland,Plz halp a girl in need.,"Hi everyone.
Sorry if this is the wrong place, please direct me to better places of there is any. 
This is actually my first ever post on reddit!
So I've been having consistent issues with my ps4. Multiple crashes, mostly the same error code (ce 34878 0) which seems to be a general application error. I have tried everything to fix this issue but to no avail. So I'm thinking I'm going to have hard reset my machine as a last resort to fix it or at least get it through being on lockdown for my own sanity! (will do it tomorrow as I don't want to do it so late) 
I have managed to back up my saved data online!

But I have a few questions. 

1)i need to initialize my ps4 don't I? Do I have to access that via safe mode or can I do it under the normal settings? 
2)do I also have to reinstall all system software or will initializing do that for me? 
3)im assuming I redownload my saved data from the same place I uploaded it?
4)anyone who's done this who has any reassurance then please give me some as I really don't want to kill my ps4 on the first day of lockdown in the UK!

So why is it much more in Europe???
70 fuckn euros is a lot! Like I said..Americans, imagine paying 15 dollars more! It may not seem like it, but that's a lot.. esp when we get 22 thousand per year.
15 dollars can buy you a AAA discounted game..think about it.

My question is, is it worth it? I have a launch model PS4, but I rarely have over 1TB downloaded at any given time, and can easily delete some games for space.

However, if I were to swap in a 1TB internal SSD, should i then put that 2TB HDD to the external slot. If so, would games running on the HDD perform as they have been?or would they perform better? I know the System software will perform better due to the internal SSD, but I want to see if I can still use the 2TB for game storage.

Thanks!",6,1584997115,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fnrtgw/swapping_2tb_internal_hdd_for_1tb_ssd/,PS4,1

I have had this problem for about a week, basically my ps4 detects the wifi of my neighbors but not mine, having the router next to it practically.
Here is everything you try by setting the wifi manually:
1) Change DNS, testing with a wide variety including google dns.
2) Try assigning ip, subnet mask, etc but not either.
3) Change the MTU value but also not.
4) Ask my ISP but they are not sure what the problem is.
Connected the console by cable is perfect, but I need to have it connected by wifi. Copy the data put once connected in lan to later replace them when making the wifi connection (manual) but it did not work either.
I need help.
It is a very strange error, always check to set the ssid, and the wifi password.

Keyboard works fine, but when I connect the mouse, it recognizes a mouse is connected, and goes to the ""Who's using this device?"" screen, but there's no response from any of the inputs on the mouse.  

From there, I can't get the mouse to actually do anything, despite it lighting up and having power, and the console knowing it's there.  I've tried three different mice and they've all had this same issue.

fnmnwr,HEADQUARTER6wastaken,What can a hacker do with my primary account in his system if he does not have access to my account?,"Long story short, I was logged out of PSN one day, I tried to sign back in but 2SV was activated (I didn't do this) so I immateriality went to Sony Support Chat and was able to have account secured by changing my email, password and activating my own 2SV.

The only issue is, before I logged the hacker out by changing my login info, he deactivated my PS4 via the web and set his console as Primary. So my account is on his PlayStation, but he cannot sign into my profile. I've tried calling CS to try and plead them to deactivate it over the phone but there is a high call volume and I can't get through.

In the mean time, is all my stuff safe? I set a dummy email as my PSN login, along with 2SV, so it should be secure. If he set his to primary with my account what can he do if he can't sign into my profile?

I have all the stuff needed to identify that it was indeed *my* account that was hacked.

Suddenly I can't use Remote Play on my Windows PC.

What I usually do is just plug in v√≠a USB my Ps4 controller, there is a bleep sound to confirm it, start the app and press options in the controller. The app will fin my ps4 and that's it.

But now, my pc bleeps indicating it detects my controller but it says wireless controller for some reason. When I start the app I'm not logged in and when I press options button it works as if I was only on my ps4 (opens a menu in ps4), the app does nothig.

&amp;#x200B;

What I tried:

\-reinstalling the app (same error)

\-changing usb cable (nothing chappens)

\-deleted the wireless device in device manager, restarted the pc (detects again the controller as wireless controller)

\-deleted the remote play folder so I have to log in manually, the first time I opened the app it asked me for my credential but every time I open the app again my session is not started and I have to select log in, which logs me in immediatelly.

Basically I got myself a new ""cheap"" 2.5"" external drive enclosure when I ran out of space on my OG PS4. 

For some reason I also got this message ""the external storage device was not disconnected properly"" everytime I was either in a middle of a game(+-40GB) or trying to move a large game from System storage to Extended.

Tried different cables and Power settings set to Always On USB but the problem always came back. Went through a few threads and most of the feedback suggested that one should just buy a new enclosure, meaning the issue was with the actual enclosure because the Hard Drive was new.

Well, in my desperate attempt to open up some space on the system till I got the chance to buy a new enclosure, I found out something else.

The hard drive ran too hot...hence why it would only stop while it was in the middle of a intense game or while it was copying a big file. I managed to get the game off System storage by placing the enclosure on an ice pack/block(both inside sandwiche bags) and managed to move the whole of Doom(at 80GB) without a hitch.

Just thought this would be helpful to someone that was wondering on the root cause.

My question: Has anyone encountered limits to how long a game‚Äôs updates might be supported? 

If that‚Äôs not clear, here‚Äôs what I mean: 

When you load a game for the first time, there‚Äôs always a good-size update file that downloads, even if the game came out yesterday. Patches, fixes, etc. 

If I load up a five-year-old (or whatever) game for the first time, though, will those updates still be available for download? Or is there a typical time limit for how long such updates/patches are supported?",4,1584967633,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fnjdoj/do_game_updates_expire/,PS4,1

Then some youtubers start making toturials how to get it back. I thought why not trying it, because what could go wrong everyone in the comments had no Problems so why should I bother.

I made it like in the Video descripted. I deleted it from my system. 
Then I checked the library if its still there and 

BOOM

No P.T. In it anymore!

WHY??? The Savefiles are still on my PS4 but not the Game even though in the Library its not longer there! 

Is there any way to get it back without jailbreaking the PS4?

A 6'9 Shooting-Lock that can Shoot 3s, and body 7'3 Centers on Boards, and Defense. He has all badges, Gym Rat, and Alpha Dog.

Lastly, a 7'3 Shooting-Lock that has all badges, and Alpha Dog. I've played 50+ NBA Games with him, so you just have to win Playoffs for Gym Rat.

The Centers have the same Badges, as they are the Same Build, just one has Better Stats, and the other is Taller.

fnfw1x,UltimaKnight99,Are PS4 games have different servers depending of the game's region?,"I'll explain. 

A few days ago, one of my friends from Spain sent me an EU copy of Mortal Kombat X. Before this, I've actually bought the game in my country (Argentina, in South America) but I sold it about 3 months ago.

 When I start the game, it all runs well (the most obvious change is the language but I got used to it), it's the online that changed. Apparently it connects me to the EU servers even tho I'm using an Argentinean Account, which make the connection unstable as hell.

 So is the Game always connecting to the EU servers no matter what account and, are all games like this?",0,1584948326,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fnfw1x/are_ps4_games_have_different_servers_depending_of/,PS4,1

Then I plugged in one of my USB cables to the PS4 and onto the controller to connect it back to the PS4 as I would usually do when using the controller for anything else. However this time the controller didn't automatically pair with the console, it instead flashed orange as it does when charging a controller for about 2 seconds then it disappeared and it showed nothing until I held the PS button which when I did do that the light kept on flashing a light blue-ish almost white color for a few seconds before turning completely off yet again. I have tried pretty much everything from resetting the PS4, the controller itself, cleaning the USB ports (which actually helped with the overall cleaning of my console but not the pairing issue because there was quite a bit of dust held in there lol), taking the power plug out and leaving it for 2-3 minutes then replugging the PS4 back on, forgetting the controller on my phone, pretty much everything I can possibly think of. At this point, I will be making a call to PlayStation‚Äôs customer support line and hoping that they are able to help with my problem. However, since it is currently very late for them to answer my calls I wanted to post this on the official PS4 subreddit in the off chance that someone might might be able to help me with my issue, if anyone has any idea of what I should do or even a suggestion please make sure to comment on this post as it would be greatly appreciated.

Boot it up again today (22nd) and it says my save data is corrupted and I need to restart the ps4. I do as it says, it doesn't restart. It doesn't turn on either so I unplug it and turn it on again. It goes into safe mode, giving me instructions till it says to download update 7.02 via USB. I downloaded the file to the USB and named everything just as they said to on their official website. It tells me it can't find the file. I then try downloading it via internet, which seemed to work. But when it goes to check (my save data I believe) it stops at about 26/27% and goes back to telling me to download update 7.02. I'm getting real stressed over this because I don't want to have to factory reset and download the games I got (and replay Detroit from the start).

Fallout 4- Started out strong but it just became too much of a chore to play, story wasn't good enough to hold my interest, again, another game I really wanted to love but just couldn't.

And last but bit least.. 

The Batman Arkham games, all three of them. Something about these games just felt off to me.

fn7tf5,fallen_turtle,Sticking trigger troubleshooting,"I, like many others, am having a problem with my controller's trigger. My specific issue is the left trigger seeming like its being pressed when its not. It's not constantly and some times it sticks that way until i pull on the trigger a few times and sometimes its just a momentary ghost press.

So after doing some researching I ordered a new set of triggers and springs. I've now taken apart the controller but the thing is that I can't see anything physically wrong. No broken plastic bits or anything.

Could there be a micro bend is the spring or something that would cause my issue. Both triggers feel the same to me in regards to resistance and general movement. Maybe its such a small amount I can't tell, but when I am getting ghost presses it doesn't feel like the trigger is still a little depressed.

I'm curious is there is something I should be looking for that its super obvious. I'm hesitant to actually go through with replacing the triggers because the new ones actually look shoddier than the old ones in regards to the ridges and what not on the under side and where the spring sits.

So I guess my options failing to identify a faulty component are either put it back together without replacing anything, just replace the springs, or replace the springs and triggers.

fn6zno,william137m,PS4 Account deleted question (for game),"About i'm not sure maybe 2 years ago? 1 year ago I got my account deleted, I was bothered by it at first but it was my own fault so I moved on.  
I emailed playstation also after it and I think they said if I email them with a $30 PS4 gift card or maybe it was 40 don't remember I can get my account back. I never really bought much games digitally so I didn't bother with doing this but I recently noticed after wanting to hop back on minecraft that it was the demo

This was incredibly weird considering I had screenshots of minecraft on my system the full version. I figured this is because I bought minecraft digitally and since my account was deleted playstation cant confirm that I actually bought it.   
IS there any way at all I can still play the full version of minecraft or is my money just permanently wasted?  
(incase you're wondering, my account ban had nothing to do with minecraft or buying minecraft digitally. That all went through fine",9,1584910363,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/fn6zno/ps4_account_deleted_question_for_game/,PS4,1
