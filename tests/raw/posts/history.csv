fsejyo,DonnkeyKongJR,How wealthy did the Crusader States become?,"So I'm reading up on the early Crusader states right now, and I'm wondering just how well they did economically.  I know that the region always had a good position of being ""middle-men"" between the east and the west and was able to gain a lot of wealth through that trade, but I'm imagining with a set of European controlled kingdoms in the region this trade should open up even more correct?  As the nobles and merchants would presumably have plenty of connections in Europe with which they can go to.  Follow up question, how wealthy would an individual merchant get from this trade?

fpdyh3,exlarson,"I‚Äôm Erik Larson, author of six bestselling books, including The Devil in the White City and my newest, The Splendid and the Vile. AMA.","My name is Erik Larson and I am the author of eight nonfiction books, including The Devil in the White City, In the Garden of Beasts, Dead Wake, and my newly released, The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz. I write what is sometimes called ‚Äúnarrative nonfiction,‚Äù a fancy way of saying that I draw on a wide array of original sources to capture the real-life suspense and drama of past events. My latest book, The Splendid and the Vile, takes place during Churchill‚Äôs first year as prime minister, May 10, 1940, to May 10, 1941, and seeks to answer the question, how on earth did he, his family, and his ‚ÄúSecret Circle‚Äù of advisors manage to endure the German air war against Britain, which unfolded during that 12-month period. In these tense times of ours, I for one found a certain solace in learning how Churchill confronted that unfathomable challenge and how along the way he taught the British public the art of being fearless. If you‚Äôd like to learn more about my books, please visit www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/225405/the-splendid-and-the-vile-by-erik-larson/. I‚Äôm here now to answer your questions, whether about the books, or my writing process, or the importance of Oreo cookies, or whatever else you choose. So‚Ä¶ask me anything!

foq1n8,AutoModerator,"Bookclub Wednesday, March 25, 2020","The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",70,1585141957,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/foq1n8/bookclub_wednesday_march_25_2020/,history,1

My university has essentially shut down, and so I'm now ~~putting Reddit threads together~~ *working from home without any distractions*.

If you're looking for something to read, watch, or listen to I've put together this short list. If you have any suggestions, please leave them in the comments.



###eBooks

* [Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/what-we-publish/textbooks/listing?aggs[productSubject][filters]=66BE42A30172E280FDE64F8EE2F485B0) - Cambridge University Press has temporarily put **all of their e-textbooks out for free**. In the history category alone, this means 70+ academic texts all available, or soon to be available, for download.

* [100 Free History ebooks from Project Gutenberg](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a9hsti/here_are_100_free_history_ebooks_from_project/) - Project Gutenberg is a great source for public domain books, and not just for these 100.


###Online Resources

* [Broadside Ballads Online, from the Bodleian](http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/) 

* [English Broadside Ballads, from the University of California](https://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/)

Both of these databases hold thousands of digital copies of published pamphlets, covering politics to religion to songs and comedies. For example, [this account of a witchcraft trial](https://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/31034/image) can be seen in its original form, but also in a transcribed (and more readable) version. Also, because these are ballads, you can listen to them.

* [Early English Books Online](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/home)

* [British History Online](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/) - a library of digitised primary and secondary sources, covering about 500 years of British and Irish history. For example, you could read how in 1660 [the English Parliament invited Charles II back to claim his throne](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/commons-hist-proceedings/vol1/pp2-25). This was about 12 years after they killed his father.

* [The British Library](https://www.bl.uk/learning/online-resources#) - Dozens of articles on topics like medieval literature, the Victorians, the abolition of slavery, Magna Carta etc etc.

* [British Library, EThOS](https://ethos.bl.uk/Home.do) - A directory of hundreds of thousands of British Doctoral Theses.

* [The Online Exhibitions of the United States Holocaust Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-exhibitions)

* [1641 Depositions](http://1641.tcd.ie/) - The testimony of Irish survivors of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, held by Trinity College Dublin.

* [Political Database of the Americas](http://pdba.georgetown.edu/) 

* [The Library of Iberian Resources Online](https://libro.uca.edu/title.htm) - Tons of primary and secondary sources, a lot of it translated into English.

* [History and Policy](http://www.historyandpolicy.org/) - When historians are consulted on modern events, this is what happens. 

* [The National Archives](http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) - The UK National Archives have a lot of digitised material available.

* [The National Portrait Gallery](https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/sitA-Z.php) - Want to see what the people in these sources looked like? Chances are they sat for a portrait, and it can be seen here.

* [German History in Documents and Images](http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/index.cfm)

* [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) - Aptly named, this has a monumental number of resources. I particularly love the newspaper collection, which has saved me a very expensive trip to Australia.

* [Papers Past](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers) - The New Zealand equivalent of Trove.

### Multimedia

* [A thread on Quality History Documentary YouTube Channels](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/aq5scj/this_is_a_list_of_quality_history_documentary/)

* [A thread on Quality History Podcasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/97wbyn/37_high_quality_history_podcasts/) - In need of an update, but most of these still hold up.

* [/r/BadHistory reviews of films and games](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/bad_history_reviews)


### Recommended Reading Lists

* [/r/History Recommended Reading List](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist#wiki_online_multimedia)
* [/r/AskHistorians Books and Resources List](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books) - The section on [online resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/links) is particularly amazing, and has many of the links in this list and more.

fkpaxr,AutoModerator,"Bookclub Wednesday, March 18, 2020","The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",14,1584537142,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fkpaxr/bookclub_wednesday_march_18_2020/,history,1

For example was crime rampant as I assume all available policemen were deployed to the front? If so did they police themselves? How did they pay taxes, send post, settle civil disputes (I assume civil courts weren't active at this time). Was it common for people's savings to be wiped out as banks got bombed? 

I apologise if this is a broad question, each part doesn't have to be answered but it would be nice if someone gave me a general understanding what a average day would be like in the final days of Nazi Germany.

fh6bxe,OldWorldBluesIsBest,Why did the Confederate states have fewer men than the Union did during the American Civil War and was it actually possible for the South to beat the North?,"We are going over the American Civil War in my history class and it seems like in almost every battle we‚Äôve gone over the Confederates have been outnumbered by some significant margin.

Wouldn‚Äôt the Confederates actually have more men since they could leave their jobs and farms for awhile and rely on slaves to do the work?

I get that the Confederates probably couldn‚Äôt draft/recruit African Americans since a lot of them would probably try to desert or get to the Union‚Äôs armies. Plus they relied on African Americans for their economy to keep functioning. 

According to my history teacher the Union had a much larger manpower pool that allowed Ulysses S. Grant to occasionally make it a war of attrition. Additionally my teacher said the only reason the south wasn‚Äôt beaten sooner was because Robert E. Lee was such a good general. 

Sorry if this gets asked frequently. 

TL;DR Why was the South so outnumbered by the North? Was it really due to the fact that the North could recruit African Americans or was there another big factor in it? Also, why did my history teacher make it sound like the South only survived as long as it did because of Robert E. Lee?

fgwxm6,AutoModerator,"Bookclub Wednesday, March 11, 2020","The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",20,1583932350,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fgwxm6/bookclub_wednesday_march_11_2020/,history,1

fdct22,AutoModerator,"Bookclub Wednesday, March 04, 2020","The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",9,1583327557,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fdct22/bookclub_wednesday_march_04_2020/,history,1

f9t038,AutoModerator,"Bookclub Wednesday, February 26, 2020","The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",19,1582722732,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/f9t038/bookclub_wednesday_february_26_2020/,history,1

f6aeng,AutoModerator,"Bookclub Wednesday, February 19, 2020","The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",13,1582117975,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/f6aeng/bookclub_wednesday_february_19_2020/,history,1

f2r0aa,AutoModerator,"Bookclub Wednesday, February 12, 2020","The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",11,1581513135,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/f2r0aa/bookclub_wednesday_february_12_2020/,history,1

ez9cu5,AutoModerator,"Bookclub Wednesday, February 05, 2020","The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",15,1580908352,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ez9cu5/bookclub_wednesday_february_05_2020/,history,1

evmozs,AutoModerator,"Bookclub Wednesday, January 29, 2020","The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",22,1580303529,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/evmozs/bookclub_wednesday_january_29_2020/,history,1

eutewf,SecretsPBS,"I‚Äôm Michael Berenbaum, a Historian who Specializes in the Effects of the Holocaust. I Appeared in a Documentary Focusing on one of the Greatest Moral Questions of the 20th Century: Should the Allies Have Bombed Auschwitz? Ask Me Anything!","In April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in ≈Ωilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.

While millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler‚Äôs account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?

[Secrets of the Dead: Bombing Auschwitz](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/bombing-auschwitz-about-the-film/4685/) explores this dilemma through dramatic recreations of arguments that took place on both sides of the Atlantic and first-hand testimony from historians, survivors and expert voices. January 27, 2020, marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
