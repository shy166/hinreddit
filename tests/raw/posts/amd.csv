fsnlbs,HauntedFrigateBird,Build Complete! 3950x / X570 / 64GB DDR4-3600 / 2070 [3080 whenever it drops],"I hadn't built a new PC in almost 6 years...boy have things changed! Both in terms of components and my needs.  I've taken up and become fairly advanced with photography and have been mixing in some video editing as well.  My partner has started a band and needed some audio rendering as well.   

I agonized over the TR 3960x vs the 3950 for 3 weeks.  I needed to decide because I knew supply chains were collapsing.  Ultimately I went with the 3950 because it let me come in way under budget (Was willing to spend ~4000) and honestly the 3960x was overkill.  If I was charging clients and working 10 hours per day rendering instead of doing it for myself/gf maybe 5 hours per week I would have gone 3960x.   PLUS, saving money on this and going with the cheaper GPU means I can easily fit the 3080 into the build whenever that drops.  That, and some CL16-16-16 memory will be the upgrades I do here.  

Aesthetically I went completely different as well, never done a white build before...it reminds me a bit of a storm trooper.  I'm not big on LED, but I may upgrade with some blue fans.  I also can't recommend that case enough.  The Meshify S2 is probably the best case I've used for cable-management, air-flow, and drive storage.  Just a masterpiece.  Made the whole process ridiculously simplistic.  

[Gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/matts915/albums/72157713586547828) of photos; (click the photo then you can scroll through, no clue why multi-image isn't working).  I'm extremely happy with the build, the AIO cooling has worked well; with all cores loaded 100% I don't think I've been past 60C.  Any ideas of what benches people use these days?  Cinebench R20 I got 9367 running stock, and single core 509 again running stock.

fsmmh3,iraelan,Ryzen 9 3900x 75°C temperature bad?,"Hello guys.

So let me start of by saying I'm a total noob. 

Got me a great new rig with Ryzen 9 3900x as a CPU, and an ROG B450-E motherboard. Also on my case I have 3 front facing fans that go at 1300 rpm as far as I can tell and a Arctic Freezer 34 DUO cooler for my CPU. 

Now, this is basically a workstation, but I do some light gaming too. My issue is that in some games like Elder Scrolls Online which aren't really super optimised, my temps fluctuate anywhere between 60-75/80°C. Also, I'm running a reshade over the game itself. 

I have no idea what to expect from this CPU, but I want to make sure it's lifespan isn't affected by some dumb mistakes I'm making. So...

1. Are these temperatures normal?

2. If so, when do I start worrying? 

3. And what about my fan setup? Should I get 2 more fans for the top of my case? 

Thank you in advance guys. Excited to be part of the AMD fam now!",21,1585692911,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fsmmh3/ryzen_9_3900x_75c_temperature_bad/,Amd,2

fsm1dw,terryheavy,My Upgrade... I am missing something....?,"Hi nice community of AMD. This is my first post on this sub

So I spent a bunch of money: 

I've got the 3950X, 32GB of DDR4-3000 (2x16) and a 5500XT 

I'm not a gamer, I use this for work... I'm a developer, but I work with some science calculations and such things sometimes need as much cores as possible.

This upgrade from Ryzen 7 1700, 16GB, and my beloved little RX470, which I'm going to sell soon.

I was going to upgrade my PSU, and my motherboard, but I run out of money... 

MB is a Gigabyte AB350 Gaming, not Gaming 3, just ""Gaming"" (Gaming 1?) I had to update the bios, before putting the 3950X, of course I did.

PSU is a Thermaltake 500W 80plus. (no bronze, no silver, no gold, just ""80 plus"")

I bought a Scythe Ninja 5, air cooler, because water cooling is not for me. The System is ROCK SOLID. Performance jump was outstanding.

Do you think it makes sense to upgrade the motherboard? What about my PSU? And cooler?

fsiqit,walentaz,So Wattman (performance tuning) years later is still a mess.,"I'll keep it short - it kinda works, I mean it applies overclocking values I set both globally and per game profile, however it completely screws up auto cooling curves.

If I apply any OC, even a goddamn 1 MHz, fan speeds go completely haywire (I'm on MSI RX470 Gaming X 4GB). At stock (1242MHz) everything works fine fan speeds (on auto) are ~1200rpm during full load. However if I do any OC, even by 1MHz, the fan speeds quickly ramp up to 1800rpm (which is unnecessarily loud) and even above and Zero RPM function stops working completely - I turn off the game and fans just keep spinning at that high RPM, temps drop into 30'C range and it still sits at that ~1800rpm.

The only way to unglitch it is to switch to manual fan control and back to auto and then re-enable Zero RPM, or restart the PC. This never happens on stock settings.

I mean if they bothered to add OC features to driver software - why it does not work as intended and constantly bugs out?? I mean it's been few years now and it's still utter mess. Wouldn't be about a time to finally fix it?

Now I would use manual fan control curve - if it actually behaved as curve and if Zero RPM could be usable with manual settings.. My GPU is at the age where it could use some OC, but despite Radeon Settings having OC functionality I'm forced to use 3rd party software - like what's the point of all this in such case?",9,1585680658,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fsiqit/so_wattman_performance_tuning_years_later_is/,Amd,2

I created a post earlier about running a 4.5ghz cinebench R20 run @ 1.3v and settled for 4.4ghz @ 1.2375v. But I upgraded from a 7 year old i5 4670k purely to play DCS in VR and even at stock speeds the bottleneck in now my 1070, as it should be. So I decided to drop it down to 4.2 and see how far I could push it. Got an R20 run @ 1.1v, and at 1.05v it instantly borked out when I pressed run.

1. Search “crash” in r/AMD and sort by newest 
2. Search “crash” in r/Nvidia and sort by newest 

You’ll notice many more posts about specifically GPU crashes in AMD’s sub. I unfortunately listened to reviewers who said that all of Radeon 5000 series issues were fixed with driver updates when in reality there are tons of people dealing with black screens and crashes. 

The worst part is, I tried to contact PowerColor to RMA my card and they told me that I needed proof of it not working in another system. I don’t know where tf I’d find another system to put my card into. All I know is that I’ve done a reasonable amount of troubleshooting and still gets crashes everyday. 

To people who think that I probably haven’t done enough troubleshooting - I purchased a 2070 super recently and have experienced 0 crashes.

Load temps (all fans 100%, curtains waving in the breeze):
* CPU 70°C
* VRM 125°C, 100°C after the mod, read below    

I noticed instability and throttling while BOINC was doing its thing (it's usually a gaming machine, no instabilities there).    

Mod
I then ripped off the plastic shroud that's covering the VRM cooler and zip-tied an 80mm fan on top of it. VRM temps went down from 125°C to 100°C. CPU is still throttling a bit.

TL;DR: If I get a 3600/2600 would a 580 RX allow me to play on stable 60 fps for a while?

It's been with me for quite some years now as I prefer only upgrading when I really have to...which is now. I've been reading up on what CPU to get to fit my budget and the consensus seems to be that Ryzen is a much better bang for your buck right now...which means I'll need a new mobo.

What I'm looking for is something relatively budget (&lt;€500 / ~$550) that will be able to play games on a stable 60 fps for some years even if it means I have to play on medium graphics.

I'm pretty sure the CPU I'm going for is a 3600, costing about 43% more than the 2600 here (Netherlands), but I'm guessing will last me quite a while longer.

For the mobo I was considering either the MSI B450 TOMAHAWK MAX or MSI B450 GAMING PLUS MAX, they're pretty close in price and I'm really not very good at telling mobos apart.

And as for the GPU...here's where I'm kind of stuck. I'm pretty sure I can't get away with keeping my 1050 TI anymore, a lot of 580 RX models fall within the budget I have left, would that satisfy the requirements I mentioned before?

Also a small sidequestion, is it worth upgrading RAM from 2400 mhz to 3200 mhz, or would that not have very noticable performance increases?",4,1585663090,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fsdczt/trying_to_switch_from_intel_to_amd_cpumobo/,Amd,1
fsd9jq,GenericUserino,Issue: Wattman resetting after restart and during Gameplay,"Hello fellow Redditors!

I have had this issue for a few months now: Whenever i set-up a custom profile in wattman through the Radeon software, the profile keeps resetting itself without user input during gameplay/ other random tasks. Whenever the profile gets reset, MSI Afterburner also closes itself.

I have installed MSI afterburner and RTSS, but this issue appeared before those were installed as well.

Upon searching the web for possible fixes i stumbled some older threads which tell me to change my windows power settings and disable fast boot. I did disable fastboot, in windows as well as in my bios settings, but this does not seem to have any effect on the constant crashing.

If anyone of you has an idea of how to fix this, i would greatly appreciate your comment, thanks!

fscmvi,Unplanned_Organism,Xbox Series X PCB memory layout,"So I thought I made a post after watching saturday's Digital Foundry teardown on the XSX. [https://youtu.be/yxLeYN-t9nw?t=297](https://youtu.be/yxLeYN-t9nw?t=297)

At some point there is an actual close-up to the die so you can read ICs part numbers.

[PCB Layout from Digital Foundry's video](https://preview.redd.it/rdcp5h9ukzp41.png?width=1827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=561b9a0bfa88dcf086db836f80b6ea19a75dc78b)

We weren't sure how those 2GB/1GB modules were split up, but we can see 3 ICs left and right on this picture are:

* For the two on top and bottom, K4Z80325BC-HC14, or 14Gbps 1GB ICs from Samsung [https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/dram/gddr6/K4Z80325BC-HC14/](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/dram/gddr6/K4Z80325BC-HC14/)
* For the one in the middle, K4ZAF325BM-HC14, or 14Gbps 2GB IC from Samsung [https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/dram/gddr6/K4ZAF325BM-HC14/](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/dram/gddr6/K4ZAF325BM-HC14/)

And we can see the bottom 4 modules are also 2GB ICs of the same part number. So at least on this engineering sample they're using Samsung GDDR6. Those 6 larger modules are part of the slower pool of VRAM, the remaining 4 (and sections of the 6 2GB modules) should be part of a faster pool of VRAM (advertised as 560GB/s and 336GB/s for the slower pool). GDDR6 splits 32 in 2 channels of 16 bits so I'm unsure how they make it work to obtain these figures of 560 and 336GB/s..

If they use per die bandwidth, it goes:

* 14Gbps/pin \* 32pin/IC = 448Gbps or 56GB/s per die,
* times 10 you get 560GB/s, times 6 you get 336 GB/s.
* But you don't actually split your 6 2GB ICs in two channels of 32 data pins if the IC only has 32 data pins available overall.

if they intend to keep it like this in 2 channel operation to save performance, it does actually give:

* 1750MT/s \* ((2 \* (2R+2F))/ 8) \* ((32bits \* 4ICs) + (16bits \* 6ICs))  = 392GB/s
* 1750MT/s \* ((2 \* (2R+2F))/ 8) \* ((16bits \* 6ICs)) = 168GB/s

On the Eurogamer article, it appears the 2 CCX of 4 core Zen2 CPUs are closer to the 4 2GB ICs and the rest of the memory controllers closer to the iGPU are split towards 2 1GB modules and 1 2GB module on each side. So more bandwidth there.

Apparently the consoles additionally split GDDR6 in pools of 13.5GB for games and 2.5GB for everything else. It's unclear how they split banks to do that but each 2GB chip has 32 banks of 512Mb. They would need 40 banks of 512Mb to make a 2.5GB portion if they only rely on 2GB ICs. I doubt they cut the smaller 1GB ICs.",2,1585660216,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fscmvi/xbox_series_x_pcb_memory_layout/,Amd,1

fsb00g,thegamingcro,SHOULD I REALLY WORRY? (RYZEN 5 3600 TEMPS),"Hello fellow users,

 Okay so I live near equator and summers here are really hot. I just built a pc and currently using a stock cooler for AMD Ryzen 5 3600. Now, the idle temps are around 47-52 C and are constantly fluctuating in that range and under full load, 75-82 C. I have a positive air flow with 3 intake fans and 1 exhaust fan. The case I'm using is Antec NX210. 

 The question, first of all, is should I be worried about these temps or they are normal? Second, how can I reduce the temps besides buying a new case or an aftermarket cooler? maybe some tweaking in the settings. I tried ""Active System Cooling policy"" in windows power plan and that gave me a drop in temperature but constant use of power for the fan. Currently, I use ""Profile 1"" of Ryzen Master to keep the temps down.

 I will definitely buy a better case and an aftermarket cooler in the near future but for now, I need to live up with this.

Any advice and help is appreciated

fs7n76,A_Nice_Boulder,3800X owners: What results have you managed with overclocking?,"I've managed to get it fairly stable at 4.375GHz @ 1.32V, but it would still fail cinebench on occasion. Ended up knocking the clock down to 4.35 and had no issues, but I'm curious as to what you guys have managed. Honestly a bit bummed thus far, was expecting a lot more from this CPU, but in hindsight I probably should've just gone with the 3700X and called it a day.

I vaguely recall being able to securely clock up to 4.4GHz when I had my MOBO BIOS GameBoost enabled, but that was raising voltages up into the 1.4V+ range, which I wasn't too comfortable with.",16,1585634935,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fs7n76/3800x_owners_what_results_have_you_managed_with/,Amd,1

fs5qa2,_GHQ,"Now that AMD has become competitive in both desktop/laptop CPU market, the Radeon group should do the same against Nvidia.","AMD Ryzen lineup is looking more an more like a good deal for customers, even in the laptop market where Intel has been traditionally the strongest player. I believe that Ryzen processor adoption in laptops will surely increase by the end of this year.

Conversely, the GPU market has never been fully recovered since the crypto-mining boom a couple of years back. Certainly, this is partially due to AMD's GCN and Vega cards not being able to compete with Nvidia at the high-end bracket. Recent Navi release was somewhat unsatisfactory with driver issues here and there, and in some price brackets, AMD appeared to price-matching Nvidia.

I think we can all agree that RDNA2 shows a promising outlook in the GPU market, and I am excited to see that 2020 is also the time for Radeon to be truly competitive again for the first time in the last 7-8 years (CMIIW) against Nvidia.

fs5cya,JackDuals,Newb Overclocker Here (RX5700 Flashed XT),"I've had me PC (R5 3600 + RX5700) for about a year now and out of quarantine boredom decided to try and fiddle with me 5700.
My 5700 is a reference model, which I flashed to a 5700XT (reference bios as well).

After some reading and video watching on overclocking, I've done some overclocking with Radeon Software (20.2.2). Best I've gotten (and dared lol) before the Heaven doing a full benchmark closing is:
2045Mhz@1195Mv.
Blower fan running at 80% max (loud I know, I'm just trying to see how far the card can go) let the card sit at about 80-85C with 95-100C JTemp.
Power usage hovered 200ish watts, highest I remember seeing is 225 watts.
Reading the GPU SCLK, it seemed stable at 2GHz during the Heaven benchmark.

At these settings it ran a full Heaven Extreme preset benchmark w/o crashing. 
I also got a jump of 200 points in Valley from 4302 to 4504.

I wanna get an opinion from anyone with overclocking experience. 
Does this first OC of mine seem safe?
Is it fine to run my 5700 at 2GHz constantly?

fs4tk7,raghavsood9993,DIY Handheld Gaming Console using SAPPHIRE N45-FP5 Motherboard,"I am wondering if it's possible to build a handheld gaming computer using this motherboard form factor:  SAPPHIRE N45-FP5 or BP- FP5 -  I read the motherboard is embedded with an APU with a GPU of AMD Vega 11 which takes VRAM from shared RAM.  The 2 boards are quite similar to each other and employ same components like USB ports, RAM, display ports etc. Both boards support up to 4K Display ports and 1 HDMI port high speed, 5\* USB 3.0 Ports. 

I don't know the main difference. Please help me decide which one is more suitable for this build. I mean in terms of the processor or  Accelerated Processing Unit (APU / Fusion ) which combines both the GPU and CPU to achieve performance also called FUSION, i need a quad core CPU with 2 threads on top of each physical core. I also want Vega 11 GPU. These boards employ Vega 11 GPU and the Dual Core CPU but i am not sure if they have 2 threads on top of the dual cores or if they have 4 physical cores but have 2 threads on top. I think they do but i am not sure. I do not like fan or active cooling. I don't mind passive cooling or active cooling just matter of small fan and heat sink. 

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlySBF7fOhc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlySBF7fOhc)  \- I need something like this but ill create my own because it lacks vega 11 graphics and has iris pro graphics or Intel uhd 630 graphics which is not that powerful as AMD fusion APU. As the video states it has quad core cpu with 8 hyper threads. So dont jump deep into that product and tell me that i should go for that. this is a project and i just want to get started. Im just telling people that a game console is near release but im planning to establish similar but better graphics.

&amp;#x200B;

for battery this is what ill be using :   57 Wh , 11.4 Volts , 5000 mAh \* 3 = 15,000 mAh - In the youtube video battery can be seen in picture at 2.01 of video. I can use 65 WATT QC Charger and i have one already. Should i use NCHI battery or the other normal rechargables are fine? NCHI batteries are regulated and don't explode or heat up when over charged. 

&amp;#x200B;

The form factor of board is 4"" by 4"" and pretty tiny. It's also fan less. I don't think i need a fan. This is the website:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Out of these boards, i have selected the BF-FP5 board because it has the smallest form factor and i believe it can have a fan-less architecture. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well these are the specs for the :

 

### BP-FP5

 

* High-performance ""Zen"" CPU with 14nm FinFET

#### Controls and Cursor / Keypad

&amp;#x200B;

\- How should i create the mini keypad and cursor / Mouse for use in Windows 10 Pro x64 operating system?

\- I feel like taking apart my ps4 controller and using my ps4's analog sticks as a mouse cursor rather than using a touch pad or any other touch controls. An analog stick like the one on GPD WIN 2 or Max will do. It has 1 analog control on the left side and another analog control on the right side. The stick has click in control. I do want a mini touch pad too like the gpd win max has in the middle, also ps4 controls on the middle left like Red, Blue , Yellow and Green Buttons. I will key map them later on in games. Do you think the APU/Fusion V1000 series and CPU/GPU is okay for AAA games like battlefield 4 high settings?

&amp;#x200B;

Just tell me if you were selecting a 4"" by 4"" motherboard how will you plan on getting started on creating your own handheld gaming pc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please i need many posts. No need to write its impossible to do so because i need batteries. I already have  batteries planed. I have the screen planed like a 7"" screen with decent drefresh rate and hertz/refresh rate.

&amp;#x200B;

So far these are my hardware requirments and if the board doesnt meet the requirments say the cpu doesnt meet my requirment then specify another fanless board from saphire which has 4 cores and 2 threads and has vega 11 gpu. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i need at least 16GB ddr4 2400MHz ram, quad core cpu with 2 threads, Vega 11 Graphics, USB 3.0 ports at least 1 of them, HDMI output doesnt need to be high speed, embedded APU or CPU and GPU (Fusion) by AMD, Built in M.2 for WiFi Module or WiFi, Audio Jacks, Mic Jack, Power DC in. It can have a fan but a very sleek heatsink and small tiny fan and small form factory preferbly 4"" by 4"" or 4.5"" by 4.5"" or 5"" board of saphire series NOT UDOO, rasberry pi , banna pi, they supply boards of intel and embedeed amd series but of vega 8 graphics not vega 11. Vega 11 i choose because the gpu is power full enough to run all my titles on high settings and share ram as vram.",0,1585622349,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fs4tk7/diy_handheld_gaming_console_using_sapphire_n45fp5/,Amd,1

fs30x6,Signifex,RX 480 - Fan speed too fast for no apparent reason,"Hello,

I looked around to see if anyone else was experiencing this problem but I didn't quite find anything. So basically for a while now I've been having problems with games I used to run just fine, very smoothly and with almost no noise at all. I noticed an increase in sound and started monitoring fan speed, only to find out that the fans were spinning with 2000 RPM in games like Half Life 2, with the card barely exceeding 60 degrees. 

I tried messing around with custom fan curves and that worked fine for a while, then the card started crashing during Black Mesa and Half Life 2 playthroughs, all while making a sound akin to a plane taking off before crashing. 

Anyone else experiencing this problem? Will messing with the power limit do anything about this? Is this even related to the GPU? I should mention that my PSU is the Corsair RM650X (650W). I have 16GBs of RAM and an i5 6600K.

Just curious as I am new to buying parts and apparently the GPU is different depending on the producer. 


I can choose between two GPU's (title) for the exact same price as a 5600 xt. It seems 5700 is slightly better, so why not choose it.

fs2ok1,JDorian88,Radeon RX 580 Glitching,"Ever since I updated to the new version of Adrenaline, my graphics card has been having a weird issue. Please see the image I’ve posted. What’s happening is, whenever I open a video or a game or any program that would rely on the graphics, the screen starts glitching like that. I know it’s a software problem because I rolled back to a previous version of adrenaline (prev UI, version 19 build) and it doesn’t do that. I would just keep it on that version, but newer games need updated drivers/software. 

Not sure if anyone else has had this issue, or what you did to fix it? I’ve played with pretty much all the settings in Adrenaline, to no avail. I thought I had luck originally when I turned ‘Wait for Vertical Refresh’ to ‘Always On’, but it only helped for one game session, then started glitching again.

CPU-Z reports 1.384 volt while under load and I peak at 74 C full load with a Kraken x62 AIO.

i was hyped for both the gpu and cpu when i got them(Sapphire Nitro+ RX 5700 XT and 3900x) but the crashes coming from gpu are so frustrating. right after i bought the pc new path of exile league came out and it was unplayable. crashes on every summon of a league boss. after that there were many random crashes in and outside of games. and wehn i say crashes i mean you have to hard restart the pc. 

around january it got better but not 100% solved. i still get that one random crash maybe once a week but i guess i got used to that but today the pc froze while i was doing some work and i guess thats why im here

when the card works it does what its supposed to do but the random crashes are not worth it.

I've been thinking about removing the fan shroud of a Powercolor Vega 56 Red Dragon and replace them with 3 Noctua A9x14s. Why? I want to make it fit into my DAN A4 SFF case.

According to the official page the card measures 305mm in length which is only a few mm too long (some other pages say 316mm but I rather trust the official powercolor page) . Removing the plastic shroud could make it a perfect fit in my case which hosts up to 300mm length GPUs.

What I couldn't find in any post or review was the  size of the actual heatsink (length! and also if it's even). Furthermore, I'd love to know the depth of the fan/shroud as to know whether my triple A9x14s can fit.

So if anyone owning a Vega 56 Red Dragon helped me out on this, it would be greatly appreciated!",4,1585604224,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/frztkd/vega_56_red_dragon_mod_sffpc_heatsink_measure/,Amd,1

frvw5v,ajshell1,I'd just like to thank AMD for making their Wraith Prism mounting system compatible with AM3+ stock cooler mounting systems,"You see, I have a gaming PC and a NAS. Recently I bought the gaming PC a Ryzen 7 3700X (which came with a Wraith Prism), but I just reused my trusty Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo, since I wanted my cooler's fan to push in the same direction as the case's rear fan (also because I don't want RGB lighting in my PC). The i5-4690K from my gaming PC was placed onto a new Supermicro board I got for my NAS, which was previously running an A8-7600 on an AM3+ board.

I then decided to get the cheapest case and PSU combo for the A8-7600 (along with an old GTX 750 of mine) so I could have it as a functional computer, even though I haven't quite decided what I'm even going to do with it yet. Perhaps it would make a good emulation machine after I install RetroPie onto it.

Well, I was initially going to use the A8-7600 stock cooler, but then I realized that the Wraith Prism would fit as well! Not only that, the cheap case I got was so cheap that it had air holes on the side panel that were intended to be used by stock coolers, so this environment would be perfect for the Wraith Prism!

All in all, I'm just happy that I got the chance to use that Wraith Prism on something. And I'm happy that I don't have a reason to replace the A8-7600 on that machine.",5,1585591800,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/frvw5v/id_just_like_to_thank_amd_for_making_their_wraith/,Amd,1

fruqs2,Kreanj,Reboots with a Vega 56,"Hi,

I've been experiencing random reboots while playing some games and I don't think it's an overheating problem. I never go above 70-80°C max in last gen games, but in some games my PC reboots.

  
The worst part is that I never experienced crash while using High-Ultra graphics settings on games like RDR2, Doom and BF5 even when I hear the fans going wild; but just a few hours ago my pc rebooted while playing Mount And Blade in medium settings.

So I request your help and advice because I've heard so many different opinions, from so many different people, that I don't know what's the real source of the problem.

My own guess is that my PSU (Hexa+ 500) is crappy and old, and doesn't deliver enough power to my Vega 56, but some people told me it's not the problem.  


I hope you can help me because I'm really starting to lose hope lol...

frred7,-S0Lid-,"Save your nerves, don't buy RX 5700 XT","This card is THE BEST in the price value category.

But somehow there is always exists this word \`BUT\`...

And here this \`BUT\` is a game-changer.

I decided that I buy this card since it was released. The performance and price are really good.

And I bought it in march 2020. This is more than 1 year since the release date.

After 2 hours of using this card, I opened for myself a completely new world. 

A world of RX 5700 XT problems.

I play mostly only 2 games: PUBG and DOTA 2.

In DOTA there is pick stage. (every person has to choose a hero to play) And if you would not pick a hero then the game ends with the next consequences:

* The game reduces the behavior score of the player a lot (means u will play with other such players) means u stop enjoying the game after a few such cases. Increasing the behavior score to the previous level takes a lot of time it is almost impossible.
* You have to play a few low priority games to resolve your abandonment.

Since I bought the card it crashed a few times in the pick stage.

And a lot of times during the game. The same consequences applied when u would not rejoin the game in a 5m period. 

In PUBG when u are driving a car or running cross the field it is super annoying when the game crashes. U should start a new game right away.

I had a lot of different issues. I guess all possible issues that u can read on Reddit.

And I believe I tried all possible solutions that I could find.

After 2 weeks of reading trying. I returned it.

Sure maybe some peoples do not have these issues.

But there are A LOT of people that do have it. Just write 'RX 5700 XT problems' on google.

My wishes to AMD: please save our nerves and fix DRIVERS.

I bought a new card and it is not AMD.

frqvgb,sudox785,AMD Ryzen 5 3400G YouTube Video Stuttering,"Hi There,

I have the issue that the YouTube Videos start stuttering on my 3400G randomly. This happens on all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge Chromium). In the Windows 10 Task Manager the GPU tab gets on 100% (Video Encode) while playing 1080p video and that's when stuttering occurs. I also tried different OS (Fedora) and this still occurs. 

I do have dual monitor setup (2 x 1920x1080p 27inch monitors), could this be issue? I'm not sure. 

This issue is not only happening on YouTube tho, it's Twitch too.

Drivers are latest version from Windows Update.

I'm confused because like I play games a little bit, and it performs more then decent, for my needs more then satisfactory, I find it hard to believe that it can't play simple 1080p YouTube video normally. Maybe drivers issue, but I don't know do you guys perhaps encounter this? By the way issue is the same [like in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/eoylpv/amd_ryzen_3400g_youtube_stutter/), but there is no solution there.

&amp;#x200B;

My build:

CPU/GPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3400G with Vega 11 with Stock Cooler

SSD: Samsung 970 PRO 512GB

Motherboard: B450 Tomahawk Max

RAM: 2x16GB G-Skill Aegis 3200MHz running in Dual Channel mode

frpf0h,Sinuks,Is a B450 board okay for a 3900x? Or x570 a 3400g?,"Hey all,

I'm starting to build another machine, haven't built one since the i7-6700k was hot on the market. I remember refreshing newegg constantly to see those were in stock. Anyhow, I'm picking up some lower end parts to get my build going for now, and then I want to transition into a 3900x maybe around Christmas timing, unless the next gen is even more appealing. From what I gather, this generation will be the last before AMD phases out AM4, which is fine with me.

As of now, I'm picking up a 3400g, 8gb of 2666mhz ram, and and m.2

My question is, would it make more sense to buy an x570 and install the 3400g in that, or moving forward will a 3900x still maintain all of it's benefits on say a b450 tomahawk board?

The PC is mostly for my home use, I'd like to start working inside of visual studio more developing, probably running some VMs, host my personal plex server, and maybe some light gaming. (If any, SOME 1080p. I had honestly planned to just pick a sub \~100 card since I'll need discrete graphics for the 3900x, probably an RX 580 if I find a cheap 8gb model.)",8,1585569257,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/frpf0h/is_a_b450_board_okay_for_a_3900x_or_x570_a_3400g/,Amd,1
frp8wl,7ombstone,"Upgrade to 3700x from 2600? For long-term use. 144hz 1080p, RX 5700 XT ref.","I would like to know some advices before upgrading.

I'm thinking of an installment plan or financial plan for the 3700x if that is good because I can't really just cash in the price of that cpu.

The plan has 0% interest by the way

Some people say that 3600 and the 3600x is enough for gaming as long as you upgrade to the 4th gen later on. Still if I were going with either of those CPUs, they will still be put into an installment plan even if they are cost a bit less than the 3700x. I won't be upgrading anymore after I upgraded to the 3700x because I think the 3700x is good enough for years and  money can be an issue again at that point of upgrading again later on.

I will also be buying the b450m mortar max with the cpu.

Important:

Also the reason why I'm upgrading is I have an 144hz monitor and I mostly play AAA games. I can see the huge fps drops from 144 fps down to 70-90 fps when looking at high detailed areas and as well as crowded areas and my fps increases when I look away at that certain area on where the things are. It is really annoying and it ruins my gameplay experience making me more focused on my pc's performance rather than the gameplay. Both cpu and gpu usage doesn't even max out when having these drops, they even decrease and sometimes increase to 10-30% of usage. I also don't OC too, I'm scared of it. But I could do a mild oc with the stock cooler if that is ok.

My specs
RX 5700 XT reference card, 20.2.1 amd driver
A320 pro vh plus (to a B450m mortar max later on)
2x8 3200mhz tuf teamgroup gaming alliance
520w seasonic bronze
Ssd(os), hdd(games. It doesn't matter where I put them to)
144hz 1080p curved monitor

A week ago, I have bought a new AMD laptop. Specs:

Ryzen 5 3500u (integrated Vega 8) (15W)

8 GB DDR4 RAM (dual channel)

256 GB SSD

I have been experiencing some issues, that I can hopefully say are now fixed with these few steps that I recommend:

1. get a fresh windows install (remove all bloatware and rest all settings) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtHZueEZe9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtHZueEZe9s) (use the USB drive method; optional, altho very recommended)
2. Install the latest AMD Drivers (Adrenalin) [https://www.amd.com/en/support](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
3. Install mobile chipset drivers update. This is a BIG step that I have seen literally no one recommend. Fixed many issues like missing AMD balanced power plan.  [https://www.amd.com/en/support/chipsets/socket-fp5-mobile/amd-ryzen-and-athlon-mobile-chipset](https://www.amd.com/en/support/chipsets/socket-fp5-mobile/amd-ryzen-and-athlon-mobile-chipset)
4. If your CPU maximum frequency gets limited (mine was at 66%) under load (you can check in resource manager), fix it by pressing the Windows image + R  keys to open the 'Run' command box. Type regedit and enter. Open the Registry Editor. Go to: 

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\intelppm

At the right pane:

\-Double click the ""Start"" key.

\-Modify the value data from '3' to '4'

\-Click OK.

\-Restart the PC

&amp;#x200B;

If you run into issues while gaming, your GPU might get limited to 400MHz. To fix this, you can download Ryzen Controller [https://www.ryzencontroller.com/](https://www.ryzencontroller.com/) and force it to run at higher clock (I recommend about 835 MHz).

I have found that many people say that if you experience performance issues with Ryzen mobile, it is because your CUP has a maximum TDP of 15. I have found that in MOST (not all!) cases, this is untrue. your CPU will of course run slower than 25W or 35W, sure, but it does not mean a third of the promised performance (you can also use Ryzen Controller to make your TDP higher).

frml6u,Personzoo,Feature Request: Notify me when my overclock profile gets reset,"I know AMD reps browse this subreddit sometimes, and I haven't had much luck on AMD's forums in the past so I'll post this here.

For anyone who doesn't know, semi-frequently your overclock settings made in wattman will get reset to default. This seems to happen usually when there's an unexpected shutdown, but for me it also seems to happen at random even when there isn't an unexpected shutdown. Normally something like this wouldn't be a problem, but the radeon software does not notify you when your profile is reset. It just does it and leaves it til you discover the problem. For me this is a pretty big deal because I have my card undervolted with a pretty modest fan curve to keep noise at a minimum. It becomes pretty apparent when my profile resets because my fans spin up a ton and the card gets way hotter then normal. 

I understand that something like this is a safeguard against people bricking themselves out of their computers by setting some value to something stupid. But in my case it's just annoying

The solution is to give me the option to have radeon software notify me when my settings get reset. I feel like I remember it doing this in the past but I'm not sure and it doesn't do it now. Just have a pop-up in the windows notification tray telling me that my settings were reset, and give me a little button that lets me apply my last profile. This would save me from having to stop whatever game I'm playing to let my card cool off and apply my profile.

This is a small feature but I would really appreciate it. If there's already a solution to this in the software please let me know!",19,1585554611,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/frml6u/feature_request_notify_me_when_my_overclock/,Amd,1

frlh9u,alvarkresh,Ryzen 1800X stress testing shows temps &gt;85 C - cause for concern!,"I'm using a Ryzen 1800X with a cooler taken from a 1700X box (the Wraith Spire w/ LED). I had a devil of a time getting the heatsink on, but I do believe I managed to screw it on properly. My motherboard is an Asus Prime X370 Pro, upgraded to a recent BIOS (not the one that disables PCI-E 4.0 support though).

Fast forward to me finally getting the system up and running. Idle temps fluctuate between 27-41 C in Ryzen Master (if I have the speed + temp readout on it goes to the upper end of that scale but if I turn it off, it goes down). Q-fan is turned off so the fan always runs full tilt. The speeds never vary from 3.85 GHz.

I ran the CPU-Z stress test using 17.01.64. At first it seemed all right, but I got concerned when I noticed that the temperature on the CPU just kept creeping up, peaking at 87 C before I aborted the test.

I do notice that my operating voltage is 1.35 V which seems to be high line for the CPU. I've enabled D.O.C.P. to be able to use the XMP Profile of my DDR4 RAM at 2667 MHz.

Should I point the finger at my voltage, or my heatsink mounting? Or is this just something to live with on the grounds that moderate gaming/video playing will never put as much of  a load on the CPU as a dedicated stress test?",0,1585548638,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/frlh9u/ryzen_1800x_stress_testing_shows_temps_85_c_cause/,Amd,1

frhisf,NovaS1X,Zen 2 and the impacts of 16-16-16-36 vs 16-19-19-39 memory.,"Hey,

So I know there's already a plethora of information out there on Ryzen and the effects of memory timings and speed, and I feel like I've read and watched it all, but there's still a question that's been left unanswered. I'm building an mITX (2 DIMMs) rig and fitting 32GB of memory in so I both benefit from the sometimes big jumps in performance with having four ranks of memory, and I also just need the space for 4k video editing.

As I know it, DDR4-3600CL16 memory is about the best performance bracket for Zen 2 builds while maintaining 1:1 ratios and getting into more extreme memory overclocking scenarios. What I also know is that Zen 2 benefits from tight timings.

What hasn't been answered, and I'm having trouble coming to an answer over due to my inexperience with memory overclocking, is the importance of timings other than CAS. All the reviews I've come across only list CAS in their benches, but never compare the performance impact of other timings. What I mean by this, is nobody is comparing something like a 16-16-16-36 kit vs a 16-19-19-19-39 kit with all else being equal.

The reason I ask this is I'm stuck deciding between two memory kits that fit my bill, but one is a much better [B-Die kit](https://www.gskill.com/product/165/166/1562839659/F4-3600C16D-32GTZR) with tighter timings, and the other an [SK Hynix kit](https://www.gskill.com/product/165/184/1562831784/F4-3600C16D-32GVKC-Overview) with looser timings.

The B-Die kit is nearly double the price of the SK Hynix kit (429cad vs 209cad, and I'm not sold that it's worth the upgrade, but I've not been able to find an answer on the performance difference on timings other than CAS. I'm also not sure if the SK Hynix kit could be OC'd to reach the timings of the B-Die kit at 3600, and if the B-Die kit could hit CL15 or CL14 at 3600 with an OC.

If any memory gurus could help me answer this, I'd be very grateful.

frgmsr,Lovercakeforeal,Question from a noob about motherboard for CPU/GPU and PCIe stuff etc.,"(I hope I follow the rules, else let me know and I'll delete the post!)


Hello. 

I figured it was time to update my pc as it currently is using an i5 from 2014 and GTX 970. 

I want to try the new AMD stuff as it seems like it's close to team blue, but better value for performance. 


I decided to go for the Ryzen 3600 right now, as it seems like plenty of power for my daily needs (mostly gaming 1080p). And in the future, I want the Sapphire 5600 XT Pulse (seems like most of the driver problems have been fixed?).

However, I am a moron when it comes to motherboards. 
It seems like the MSI tomahawk is a popular choice, but why is it better, and would I need it when I never plug more into my computer than necessary? 


Is it worth spending more on a decent motherboard compared to a very budgetty board like a cheap micro ATX board with limited connections?",8,1585527831,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/frgmsr/question_from_a_noob_about_motherboard_for_cpugpu/,Amd,1

1800X with a Kraken X62

Ram: 32gb of base clock (cant up them but gonna buy new ones soon - was going to get the g.skill rgb X (x for amd) but they are not on the boards QVL but the g.skill website says they are on the boards QVL? As i might upgrade my cpu in a while i thought i would go for newer RAMs)

PSU: is a Corsair HX850i

And the case is a NZXT H440i Razer edition

So i got my chip to 4.0 with fixed voltage as low as 1.325 - temps in cinebench r15 are maxed at 57 degrees C

But i cant get 4.1 with 1.42 and i did not try higher is it safe to try higher or should i just take it. I might get it stable at 1.3175. but whatever i put as set voltage in bios it is always a bit higher than to what i have set it to.

I havent touched SoC voltage, should i do that or just leave that as it is?

Sorry if I spam you guys with an old cpu or the 6161678th thread about OC‘ing this Chip. But as every chip is different and i havent overclocked in years i thought i might ask first.

Thank you guys and stay healthy☺️

frffkt,sword495,DLSS on XSX/PS5?,"Will the next gen consoles (XSX/PS5) be capable of implementing neural networks (similar to Nvidia’s solution) to upscale lower resolution natively rendered images to higher resolution images whilst enabling ray-tracing? For example 1080P60FPS rendered natively then upscaled to 4K60FPS, the extra capacity can then be used to enable ray tracing or other effects to make games look better.

From what I understand this should be achievable via a firmware update to the consoles even if such a feature isn't ready for launch day. What I'm not sure about is whether this can be done on the current RDNA GPU architecture effectively to output 4K60FPS games with raytracing. 

My understanding is that these neural networks can be run on any GPU but work best on dedicated AI processors which may not be present in the next gen consoles.

Corsair 16 GB ram, 3200 MHZ

Sapphire R9 270

Adrenaline 20.2.2

Target games:Overwatch, Fallout 4, Killing Floor 2, Starcraft 2

Recently  it seems most games that played well or at least decent have become crashhappy. Tried Star Citizen yesterday and while it never ran well, it at least ran for hours before crashing, if I didn't exit first. 4 to 5 crashes in less than two hours on medium settings. KF2, Starcraft 2, Overwatch when I tried that, have also crashed quite a few times, and even desktop browsing or youtube has caused a driver reset.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The culprit I feel is Astroneer. My friends and I got into it for the Christmas event, but I was crashhappy. Took probably far too long for me to use Adrenaline telemetry to point out my issue:that while my CPU utilization was low at 20-30%, my GPU was maxed out and overheating, spiking to about 90 degrees Celsius or more before shutdown.

&amp;#x200B;

Also not helping was the discovery that my rear fan refused to spin. I'm not terribly concerned however, as I do have two exhaust fans on top of my case to help out. I will replace it next time i order from Newegg, but my bigger concern is that my case has the power supply at the bottom where the GPUs fans blow. Could that be a big issue? (Why the hell do cards blow air DOWN if all the exhaust fans are ABOVE?!)

&amp;#x200B;

I HAD wanted to try for a Vega card, but 500+ dollars is too rich for me. So I was looking at the budget options, and the Sapphire RX 580 pulse SEEMED decent, but is it? Would it be a huge upgrade for me? And then there's the cooling issue.

frb2eb,Boomam,Ryzen 3000 series - negative voltage offset?,"Hi,  
Does anyone have any idea of how the 3000 series, specifically a 3900X, reacts to a negative voltage offset? Does it lead to lower boosts?  
&amp;nbsp;    
I ask, as my 3900x when running under full load gets to a toasty 85c on a 360mm AIO.  
I've also heard that Asus have a habit of overvolting things slightly on their boards (dont know if true or not), irrespective of the Performance Enhancer and PBO mode (set to ""default"" and ""off' respectively).  
&amp;nbsp;  
Experimenting a little in the UEFI with a negative offset of -0.1v on ""VDDCR SOC Voltage"" &amp; ""VDDCR CPU Voltage"" seem to drop temps by a few degrees (5-7c) it appears in a warm room, where the CPU is also doing a full F@H on all 24 threads.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Anyone got any tips in general to lower the temperatures here?  
* Case: Fractal Design R6 TG  
* Fan setup: 2x 140mm intakes at bottom, 1x 140mm exhaust at back.  
* AIO setup: Corsair H100i on GPU, front intake, Corsair H150i on CPU, top exhaust.  
* Motherboard: Asus Strix X-470F.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'd prefer to see a load temperature under 70c if i'm being honest, but i'm not sure how i'd achieve that with this current setup.  
Open to ideas though...?

fraqll,1nmFab,AMD seems to be improving their chip density with Renoir,"GPUs:

Vega 20: 7 nm, 13.23 bn transistors / 331 mm² / Density 40.0M transistors per mm²  

Navi 21: 7 nm, 21bn transistors / 505 mm² / Density 41.6M transistors per mm²

&amp;#x200B;

Zen2 CPU: 

Density of zen2 chiplet - 7nm: 52.7M transistors/mm²  (74mm² / Transistor count: 3.9 billion)

Density of zen2 I/O die (NOT 7nm): 16.72M transistors/mm² (125mm² / Transistor count: 2.09 billion)

Density of 8-core zen2 chip (1 chiplet + 1 I/O die): 5.99bn transistors / 199mm² = 30.1M transistors / mm².

Density of 16-core zen2 chip (2 chiplets + 1 I/O die): 9.89bn transistors / 273mm² = 36.2M transistors / mm2.

&amp;#x200B;

Zen2 APU:

Renoir: 7nm, 9.88bn transistors / 156mm² / Density 63.33M transistors per mm²

&amp;#x200B;

At 63.33M transistors per mm² Renoir is 

2.1x more dense than the overall density of an 8-core Zen2 chip (I/O die +1 chiplet)

1.75x more dense than the overall density of a 16-core Zen2 chip (I/O die +2 chiplets)

1.58x more dense than Vega 20

1.52x more dense than Navi 21

1.20x more dense than a Zen2 chiplet

&amp;#x200B;

In the past I had noted that AMD 7nm densities were abnormally low and that in order for AMD to start getting performance and power benefits they must increase their densities. I was pretty much roasted for saying that ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ecca4s/transistor\_densities\_too\_low\_for\_7nm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ecca4s/transistor_densities_too_low_for_7nm/) ), however Renoir is a step in the right direction. 

Can't wait for 7nm EUV for Zen3.",42,1585507034,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fraqll/amd_seems_to_be_improving_their_chip_density_with/,Amd,4
frahvm,cowboypt,"Been away years, building a new computer, I need advice as things changed alot","So, my ten year old CPU, motherboard and ram need are bottlenecking some games I currently play.

Its an AMD FX8120, 8 GB ddr3 corsair ram at 1866 mhz and Asrock 990 FX motherboard. Of course over the time it received some updates, corsair h55 watercooling and ssd.

But now it time to revamp this and new parts and I'm way too confused with ram and motherboard compability.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of:

AMD Ryzen 3700x

Asus Rog Strix X570 - E or Asrock X570 Taichi (so it can be a little future proof. another computer for more 10 years but unsure on which one to buy)

G.Skill Kit 16GB DDR4 3600MHz Trident Z RGB CL16 (more than enough for current days and available to add more ram) but unsure if these are great or mot for the setup.

Sapphire RX 590 (Graphic card already have mine that is more than enough for me)

Seasonic Focus GX-650W 80+ Gold (Unsure of it)

m.2 SSD (I don't know which to choose)

Watercooling I was thinking of Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360R RGB (but open for sugestion as RGB is not priority)

Case already have my little run down Corsair Obsidian 750D (its a case that its kids proof, realy, excellent case it has been beaten down by then and still rolling :P )

I need help, just that, I've been out of the PC building for quite some time I would need to ""study"".

Problem is, I would love to have recent hardware under my hand. Its just that there are no cheap retail embedded boards around with newer architecture.

Its either old E1-xxxx motherboards with 2012 technology, or new lowest-end 35+W TDP AM4 builds. Since the former one is worse than similar but still not great intel offers, I am interested in the latter.


I would like to have some kind of cheapest but recent Athlon or Ryzen undervolted to 10-15W TDP levels. I heard there is a feature for it in BIOS (no need to experiment), but I would be interested whether some of the motherboards have the option for that low of a range.

Like  many of you, i have struggled since day one with my 5700 XT (GIGABYTE  OC) and the seemingly random and endless black screens that force a  restart.

I had tried EVERYTHING that you can find recommended online with no success.

That is until yesterday.

1.) Download DDU or AMDcleanuputility to remove your current drivers (i used AMDcleanup)  
2.) Download Radeon 19.12.1 from the AMD website  
3.) Run the driver install, choose CUSTOM install  
4.) Uncheck ""install Radeon Adrenaline software""  then click install  
5.) That's it!

optional

6.) Download Radeon 20.2.2 from the AMD website  
7.) Open Device Manager  
8.) Display Adapters -&gt; AMD Radeon RX 5700XT  
9.) Click update drivers  
10.) Manually search for the 20.2.2 folder (will be in the AMD folder)

You will now have the 19.12.1 or 20.2.2 drivers without any of the Radeon software that appears to be causing the crashes.

I  understand this ""FIX"" gimps your system, as you can no longer use the  few functional aspects of Adrenaline, but this has completely fixed the  black screen issue for me (i even finished a full game of APEX without  crash...) and will tide me over until AMD fixes their software.

I've taken everything back to a fresh install of Windows 10 1909, no internet connection and attempted to do the following:

* Install the GPU Driver only from the Device Manager with the .inf file (System Crash)
* Install the latest driver and software package Adrenalin 2020 March (System Crash)
* Install the old driver and software package i can find from AMD Adrenalin 2019 June/July (System Crash)
* Install the AMD GPU driver from Windows Update, once enabled (System Crash)
* Installed other drivers for mouse, keyboard, camera, gamepad, chipset etc and these all install without any problems.

I have a linux install, which is working great. 4k Gaming via Steam on Pop! OS. I have no hardware or overheating issues, no other system configurations have changed outside of attempting to update the GPU driver and Windows OS updates.

There are two open cases at the moment, one with AMD and one with Microsoft and so far i am getting the run around, basically support teams from both companies are pointing their finger at each other.

1.) Download DDU or AMDcleanuputility to remove your current drivers (i used AMDcleanup)  
2.) Download Radeon 19.12.1 from the AMD website  
3.) Run the driver install, choose CUSTOM install  
4.) Uncheck ""install Radeon Adrenaline software""  then click install  
5.) That's it!  


optional  


6.) Download Radeon 20.2.2 from the AMD website  
7.) Open Device Manager  
8.) Display Adapters -&gt; AMD Radeon RX 5700XT  
9.) Click update drivers  
10.) Manually search for the 20.2.2 folder (will be in the AMD folder)

&amp;#x200B;

You will now have the 19.12.1 or 20.2.2 drivers without any of the Radeon software that appears to be causing the crashes.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand this ""FIX"" gimps your system, as you can no longer use the few functional aspects of Adrenaline, but this has completely fixed the black screen issue for me (i even finished a full game of APEX without crash...) and will tide me over until AMD fixes their software.  


Anyway, hope this helps you out!",0,1585488272,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fr5ua4/5700xt_black_screen_fix/,Amd,1
fr5tfa,Alexmoloney,3900x vs 9900k gaming and mining build.,"Greetings I am looking at a new build, being that the 3900x and 9900k will run me about the same price these are the two I am researching/ comparing. I understand there maybe some bias here but thought I’d give it a shot and hopefully learn abit more. 

So my intention is the pc will be mining overnight, when i am at work and when I am on YouTube or Netflix (light loads) and gaming the rest of the time. I also intend to overclock which ever build I go with this is the part I have questions about. 

As best I can tell AMD is the more logical choice except as I understand in how they overclock? My experience is intel set for example 5ghz @ 1.35v all core and it will boost when needed and idle at a lower voltage. 

However from what I understand with AMD they don’t work the same way?  They stay in the high voltage range all the time and aren’t meant to be all core overclocked as such? I know I will not get the same increases as an intel chip but more cores = more better even at a lower clock. 

I acknowledge I know very little about how AMD actual work but that seems to be my understanding based on what I have read and watched so far. Look forward to learning more from this subreddit.

fr5rh0,FloMD,RX 5700 XT Pulse fan spinning hard without reason,"Hello guys,

I bought a RX 5700 XT Pulse 2 months ago. I was happy without, no drivers issues, everything was perfect. I performed a little UV at 1950mHz 1.050 V.

Few days ago, one of the two fans of the card start spinning at 100% i suppose, without reason (my card don't go above 70°C while gaming). The other fan seems to work perfectly. Sometimes it stop spinning without reason also, it is a bit random but it seems to happen more frequently in game. 

I tried to uninstall and install the last drivers. I ve reset the paremeters of my card but it didnt changed anything. Applying a fan curve doesn't change anything too. I uninstalled Afeterburner

Any of you guys have this issue ? Do some of you have an idea of what i could try to fix that ?

It's a bit hard for me to send my card to Sapphire with the COVID pandemia ...

fr4zd8,noblight7,Fan rpm speed stuck saying its at 29rpm sapphire nitro+ 5700xt,"Hey, I am having an issue with my nitro+ 5700 xt. 

The third fan in my GPU fails the Trixx software test every time.   
For a little while, the noise of the fans was SO loud constantly like it was under full load even just idling. I ended up trying to check the fans, and Trixx said my third fan was not working, 0 rpm. the other two are fine, however, upon inspecting the fan, it was definitely spinning.   


the noise was still very loud, so I ended up removing the GPU and then removing the third fan, and reinstalling. Then I used DDU and clean wiped the drivers in safe mode and reinstalled them. This fixed the noise problem and stopped the fans from running like they were being abused by infinite chrome tabs. However, the 3rd fan STILL fails the Trixx fan check, and in Radeon settings, even when I have a custom fan curve on and all three of them are running, it always says my fans are running at 29 rpm.   


The fan curve works, I have tested it on games and all the fans spin fine, I feel at a loss.   
Technically the card works fine and runs games amazingly, its just this fan issue. I even swapped the front fan for the 3rd fan and it spins but still fails the check.   


My only issue currently is that when playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey the game will crash my whole pc, I am aware of crashing issues with the game but I have no real idea if it is being caused by the game or by my fans.

so I've got some problems here.

Asus Strix X570-F Gaming  
AMD 3950X  
64GB G Skill NEO, DDR4 3600 CL16 (4x 16GB)  
GTX 1080 TI  
Samsung 970 EVO

I built this machine three weeks ago and it sometimes keeps getting stuck at (not even) boot. The system basically worked and I got to install WIN 10 and everything else I need.  
On Monday the DRAM-led started to glow orange permanently when I tried to start the machine (didn‘t post).  
I then removed all the memory sticks and tried to boot with every single module in the first slot.  
Somehow every single stick worked and it booted.  
I then put them all back in and it worked like a charm, did one run of memtest86 and no errors.

On Friday the same thing happend again after I put it to hibernate and it woke up randomly from an ""unknown source"".  
Instead of taking every module out again, I removed the CMOS battery and cleared the cmos with a jumper.  
The system then restarted a few times and booted, so this also worked.

I then sent back the motherboard, CPU and RAM.  
CPU and RAM are still in RMA and I could exchange the motherboard to another model.  
I now have got the Strix X570-E (should have a better VRM and has post code).

As I said CPU and RAM are still not here. I now took the 3950x and 2400mhz DDR4 from another (working) machine.

And I was floored -- as far as I can tell it's the same post error: the DRAM led glows again orange and the post code of the new board shows ""0d"".  
Did a bios flashback to the latest version via USB, but same thing over again - can't post. I then also swapped the PSU from the other machine and nothing but CPU and RAM in it. Still the same postcode.  
I have no idea what's going on. I put everything back into the other machine and am now writing from it...

This was my first build so some of these issues were caused by my simple lack of experience with custom gaming PCs in general, but this single issue has persisted for a while now. My RX5700 XT is underwhelming to say the least, but I’ve been making do and it has in all fairness worked well a lot of the time. However, whenever playing moderate to high-strain games (Mainly Fortnite, the new SW Battlefront II, Jedi Fallen Order, etc. all on highest graphics settings possible) my game will randomly crash to the desktop. No blue screening, shutdowns, anything.  A lot of the time my games will freeze and the audio will cut out, being replaced by an annoying and loud “BZZZZZZ” sound. Sometimes the game returns to normal after a few seconds of freezing, other times it crashes my games. This renders my PC basically unusable for gaming, so I’d like to get this resolved. 

I am currently running the most recent AMD graphics drivers, released on 19 MAR 2020. I have reverted to old drivers and this did not solve the issue.

fr0jme,WantoNoodle,Ryzen 3000 sticks to base clocks after exiting a game.,"Hi guys, I can't find any post with regards to such problems.

My specs are and bios are as below:

AGESA 1.0.0.4 Patch B
Ryzen 3700x
Trident Z Neo 16GB 3600mhz cl16
Vega 56
MSI X470 M7 Gaming AC

I use HWInfo to monitor stats

I left just a bout everything on auto except PBO settings on limits. When booting to windows, the clocks looks fine, fluctuate anywhere from 4.175ghz to 4.325ghz (idle voltage 1.45v-ish) When launching a game like DotA 2, all core clocks drops to a constant 4.15ghz and voltage drops to like 1.05v-ish, so far everything is fine.

The problem comes when I exit the game, my clocks drops to a constant 3.6ghz (idle voltage 1.1v-ish) and doesn't fluctuate at all. The clocks only boost to 4.15ghz again when I open the game, it stays at 3.6ghz no matter what I do - like opening Lightroom, Photoshop. Only when I go to Ryzen Master to select PBO and click apply then the clocks starts to boost to the initial 4.175ghz to 4.325ghz with 1.45v-ish idle voltage.

Something doesn't quite add up, it's as though a overclock profile overrides my setting when opening a game and sticks to that profile until I go to Ryzen Master to apply the PBO profile (Don't get me wrong I enable PBO from BIOS). Anyone has a solution to this? Happy to provide any details I may have missed out.",0,1585459364,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fr0jme/ryzen_3000_sticks_to_base_clocks_after_exiting_a/,Amd,1
fr0jl5,edake,Ryzen 5 3600x Stock Cooler full speed exceeding 3400 RPM," 

I just upgraded to a 3600x and MSI MPG x570 Gaming Plus Mobo. Running stock settings, I'm getting decent temperatures using the stock cooler (Wraith Spire no-led) - at 35 to 40 C at idle and an average of 60 to 65 gaming (playing Modern Warfare), CPU-Z stress tests never got me above 75 C. Also, Bios is up-to-date.

The odd thing is the fan RPM. At full speed the fan exceeds 3400 RPM, which is very loud. I saw nobody online stating they could achieve this fan speed, as most people say the max in below 3000 RPM.

However, fan % in Bios settings are whats raising the most questions for me. Like I said, max speed is around 3400-3500 RPM on my cooler, but 50% speed gets me 2300 RPM (???). I'm currently running a steep custom curve that keeps my fan running at 50% until I hit around 75 C so it's not as loud and it doesn't fluctuate as much as the default curve.

Cooler curve I'm using:  
0 - 70 C (50%) - around 2300 RPM  
75 C - (75%)  
80 C - (100%) 3400+ RPM

But do I actually need such high RPM? How come 50% is at such a high RPM?

I am confused, I'm new to tuning CPU fans and I feel like I'm missing an information.

I have the newest chipset drivers, newest Bios, newest windows, newest everything!  
The only way for it to reach the 4.2ghz is by enabling ""Game Boost"" on my motherboard (which is basically PBO and AutoOC). The problem with it is, it is incredibly unstable when reaching 4.2ghz.

I kid you not, even if I offset the vcore negatively by 0.1v on stock settings (which again, runs at 4ghz, or 3970mhz to be exact, it's not even able to peak over 4ghz...lol)

fqyqmx,TK3600,My guess on the next GPU performance: 67.6% faster than 5700xt stock,"Obviously this is my personal estimate. I could be totally wrong, but hear me out. There are my assumptions:

1. I assume the desktop GPU would be the same CU size as Xbox series X. 52 CU 12.155 TFLOPS. It makes sense because then the chip production can be streamlined.
2. The clock speed with excellent airflow would be 2.23GHz based on PS5's boost clock, which I would assume a properly PC can achieve indefinitely. This is a significant increase over 1.825 base clock of Xbox. A 22% increase in clock of Xbox.
3. I assume RDNA2 will be 10% more efficient than RDNA. RDNA2 is removing rest of the GCN that remained on RDNA, stuff that was choking Vega.
4. 5700xt has 9.75 TFLOPS at base clock.

So on top of the TFLOP increase of Xbox vs 5700xt, it will boost 22% higher on PC and be 10% more efficient IPC. That becomes 67.6% increase over 5700XT.

Potential errors:

1. Clock speed does not increase linearly relating to performance. 22% more clock would likely mean less than 22% increased performance.

2. It is assumed the card would not be choked by GDDR6 speed and bandwidth unlike Vega.

3. Nobody really knows how more efficient is RDNA2, 10% is a pure guess.",36,1585451520,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fqyqmx/my_guess_on_the_next_gpu_performance_676_faster/,Amd,1

fqxlo2,SafetySquintz,MSI 5700 XT MECH OC Results after doing thermal pads and lapping (revised long post),"TLDR: Change thermal pads, undervolt and you can get the memory junction around 80 and the gpu junction to around 90. Added 1.5mm fujipoly 13mk/W + stacked 0.5mm on top and put plastic washers behind die screws, memory junction temps dropped considerably, around to 80 down from 110. Wasn't happy with GPU junction temp still. Lapped/wet sanded heatsink with 1000-5000 grit paper. Pasted with Kryonaut. Was getting max 102 degrees junction temp but fan speed was high under AMD settings, undervolted and it got better. I'd say it's only worth changing the thermal pads and repasting, and doing your own fan curve no lapping needed. Also I couldn't tell you how loud it was since I have 3 140mm Noctua iPPC-3000 fans in the room cooling a radiator for a project.

Pics of what I did and results [https://imgur.com/a/Rf9Mm8s](https://imgur.com/a/Rf9Mm8s)

Revised tests with undervolt and OC cause people complained I didn't last time after doing what I did. The card was installed in a Corsair 250D case with a 140mm Noctua intake, 2 80x15mm slim exhaust fans and having the H100iV2 pull in air rather than push out with 2 Noctua 120mmx15mm slim fans installed on radiator, an ASUS ROG STRIXX X370-I and R5 1600X OC'd to 3.9GHZ. 16GB g.skill memory OC'd and timings/voltage changed. Fans/pump all at 100%. I tried to put comments under the imgur pics but I lost track and might be out of order, all I cared about was the max temps anyway. I  also made sure the case was under its normal operating temp so I ran some stress tests then let it sit for a few minutes then benched and stressed more. Did some undervolting and max temps were 74 memory and 91 gpu junction. See mess of imgur pics if you want and if you can deduce the results, gold star. Also not sure how much people care about 3dmark results but here they are.

fqwxpz,dzonibegood,30 FPS vsync on a 60Hz refresh rate,"Hey guys!  
I am wondering is it possible to somehow make 30 fps vsync work correctly when using 60hz refresh rate?  
When i set my display to 30hz (29.97) and i use vsync with FPS limiter it runs flawlessly. Smooth as butter but when i set 60Hz (59.94) with vsync and do the FPS limit on 30 fps (29.97) it is jittery and stuttery.  
I need 60hz with 3fps vsync to have lower input lag then 30hz with 30 fps vsync.  


Why 30 FPS? Because my GPU (rx480) is not able to sustain perfect 60 FPS for smooth stutterless experience, very so often dropping bellow 60 fps, and it is capable of doing 30 FPS smooth stutterless experience (where 99.9999999999% fps is always above 30 FPS) with everything maxed out completely.  
Second reason why i want 30 fps is because ps4 pro is in 99% of games set to 30 fps and its much more easy on me when i go from smooth as fucking butter experience to PCs smooth as fucking butter experience as with unlocked FPS (focus around 60 fps) , on 55 inch screen tears are just so huge and visible, as well as stutter is much more pronounced on it that after playing on a console with buttery smooth image I can't look at the image that is awfully torn as well as constant stutter very second or half a second because of uneven frames per second to the refresh rate.  


So I need help, if you guys ever figured out how to pull it off please comment here! I need some professional input on this how to make it work on 60hz.",64,1585444523,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fqwxpz/30_fps_vsync_on_a_60hz_refresh_rate/,Amd,1

My i5-4670 and GTX 480 finally decided to die (I'm using my laptop as of right now), so I'm looking into building a full AMD rig to handle what the old rig used to do. I put in 8gb of memory because I'm only going to be using it for blender, autocad and minimal video/audio editing. any other uses will purely just be web browsing and some light gaming (like Minecraft and Terraria). Besides, I'll probably upgrade to 16gb and insert another 2, 4gb sticks to completely populate the board's dimm slots further down the road.

I'd like to point out that I've tried to follow my original list as closely as possible while making a PC part picker list, but some things had to be changed slightly. Here's the parts list, anyway.

Option 2: Asus ROG Strix x470f-Gaming

I'm buying a 3600x and just want to know which board is better for gaming. 

Which one is easier to setup/have support for the 3600x? Or will I still need to update bios? 

Read some reviews of the x470 saying it worked without bios update. Some people said they had to use an older 1600 cpu to update the bios first. 

As far as I've read with the x570 is it works with bios update but some people had problems with the bios or didn't like the bios. 

Price difference between the combo and buying the CPU/Mobo sperate is only $40 more for the x570 combo, so that's not really big enough of a difference to factor in for me.

I was surprised by the benchmark claims made here. I used to opt for Nvidia and Intel hardware until AMD released better value ones. However, seeing that the performance on the Nvidia-Intel rigs are significantly higher across the board despite being nearly identical in price to a full AMD rig, I'm not sure how to justify the claims that AMD hardware was better value. If I'm missing something, can anyone explain what's going on?

Looking to upgrade my GPU sometime this year. I'm currently on a GTX 970 Strix and I'm thinking of switching over to Team Red. I was wondering if anyone can help give me a tier list of current AMD GPUs on the market and their nVidia equivalents? I'm not so sure what the price differences are and which cards are better suited for what.

I mainly game on 1440p on my PC. Some video editing, and some streaming. 

These are currently the GPUs that I'm looking at:

fqp5dz,sveinjustice,GPU still not working performance wise in many games,"Hello.

I have the newest drivers and still experience 50% GPU utilization on games like Bf1 and bf5.

the game doesn't wanna keep outputting frames even if i am not bottlenecked elsewhere.

I have a 3600X CPU, with 3200 MHZ 16GB RAM and a 5700 XT card. Ive returned 3 5700 XT cards in the past few months, now I hacve the XFX Ultra THICC III version.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, playing game like BF5, my GPU will just keep itself happy at 50% usage and give me around 100-130 fps, instead of making sure that I get 144+ FPS in the first place.

I can't evne get 144 FPS in most games because the GPU refuses to work hard enough to keep a set amount of minimum FPS.

&amp;#x200B;

CPU usage is nowhere near maxed, so CPU is not bottlenecking me.

&amp;#x200B;

This drivers really needs a ""Perform at Maximum capacity"" mode or ""Target frame rate"" which actually works.. Radeon Chill doesnt work properly.",37,1585418712,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fqp5dz/gpu_still_not_working_performance_wise_in_many/,Amd,1

Could people be entering incorrect BIOS settings causing massive voltage spikes? Are some chips just bad and users are claiming it was high voltage that caused it?

fql1eb,yesim_here-sup,"My experience with the 5700 XT Graphics Card so far, and advice for people thinking about buying one.","Hey guys, after reading so much negativity around this card regarding heat issues and driver issues, I still dared to buy it because the price to performance ratio was excellent, and it was barely slower than the $100 more 2070 super, which made it a very lucrative buy for me (budget gang rise up). My first choice was horrible, because I ended up buying the cheapest 5700 XT on the market which happened to be the XFX 5700 XT Raw 2. It ran HOT and LOUD, and even after setting an agreesive fan curve AND undervolting a fair bit, I was still seeing inconsistent temps ranging from 72 degrees minimum to 90 degrees maximum (edge temps) under load, and not to mention the very annoying noise because of the fan curve. No driver issues tho, as I didn’t get a single black screen or any kind of stuttering. But the temps and noise was so annoying that I decided to return it. For a second, I was being stupid enough to think about buying a 2060 super because of the same price but worse performance, and then I was thinking about buying a 2070 super, but spending 100 more dollars for a similarly performance card wasn’t sounding like a good deal to me. After doing some research, I ended up buying a Sapphire Pulse 5700 XT for only 10 dollars more (and less than the stock reference card lol), and man I am impressed with this card. The card NEVER exceeds 75 degrees edge temps under load, and I still setup slightly stronger fan curve, and now we’re talking about 68-72 degrees max edge temps under load. It is also very quiet (unless you’re ramping up fan speeds, and increasing power limit to overclock). Also, not a single black or blue screen, absolutely no stutters, and very stable drivers (I am on the latest drivers released March 19). I think this is an EXCELLENT card for 1440p gaming and medium to high end 4K gaming, and after the recent drivers, it’s very safe to say that you will most probably not have any driver related issues. Just be cautious and DO NOT buy from brands like XFX if possible. Sapphire, Powecolor, and Gigabyte are the best brands for this card, and they are very nicely priced right now. Next gen AMD cards are probably coming around October- November (read from article), so you won’t regret buying this card right now.

TLDR: personally didn’t faced any single driver related issue with this card, and has excellent temps if you go with brands like Saophire, Powercolor, and Gigabyte.

fqhoad,Newezreal,5700 XT Displayport no signal,"Hi, 

So I just got my new Sapphire Nitro+ RX5700 XT with a new ultrawide monitor from LC-Power. 
The GPU has 2 displayport ports and 2 hdmi ports. All of them work on my other monitors. 
Also, before buying the monitor, I've let them check if it is working right in the store. They connected it to their Testbench using the Displayport cable that the monitor ships with and it worked.

At home now, I can not get any picture when I connect the monitor via Displayport. Not even in BIOS. It just shows no signal. When connecting to HDMI it works. I also tried using the integrated GPU (my motherboard has a Displayport and HDMI port). When I select my integrated GPU in BIOS and connect my monitor to the Motherboard HDMI it shows a picture. But not on the motherboard Displayport, just the same issue as with the 5700XT.

I've tried 2 different Displayport cables (both brand new), turned off and on the monitor and PC many times, waited for capacitors to get empty, tried picture-in-picture mode with one hdmi connected to my laptop the other input set to Displayport and connected to the GPU/motherboard. It always shows no signal and goes into power saving mode. 
Also, I tried setting the pcie link speed to 3 in bios. Still I can't get a signal from this monitor via Displayport. Other monitors work just fine. 

I really don't know what to do next.. it's like this monitor is just not compatible with my computer at all (gpu and also motherboard/igpu)....

Any ideas on what I could try to get it working?

Thank you very much. I really want to try avoiding the hassle of sending it back also because the shop closed due to corona.",0,1585391549,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fqhoad/5700_xt_displayport_no_signal/,Amd,1

fqd2iq,Hey_Cryptic,Is it worth trying to get a replacement for my RX 5700 XT?,"Two weeks ago I made the decision to upgrade my GTX 1060 6gb to a Sapphire Nitro+ RX 5700 XT. I originally planned to stick with Nvidia and pick up the RTX 2060 super, but the price to performance on the Radeon card just seemed way too worth it. My only concerns were the driver issues that I'd been hearing so much about. I had heard that the latest Adrenaline 20.2.2 and 20.3.1 driver updates had resolved many owners' issues with black screens and crashing, and was optimistic that I wouldn't have to worry about it being an issue.

When my card finally arrived, I did all the necessary precautions to ensure I didn't have any issues. I ran DDU several times to clear out any lingering Nvidia drivers, installed the 20.3.1 driver (with factory reset enabled) and also updated my chipset drivers to their latest version. Everything was going smoothly and I was really happy with the performance of the card, but then after a few hours of Rainbow Six: Siege and COD: MW, I hit a sudden freeze and black screen. I knew something was wrong once I started getting stuttering issues in MW. Pressing the power button did nothing and I was forced to hard reset. I initially thought it was just an issue with MW, so I decided to get back on Siege to test it further, and just after about five minutes, I got another black screen.

It's been two days now, and I've tried several different options to try and fix the problem. I uninstalled the 20.3.1 driver and rolled back to the 20.2.2 version, but faced the same problems. I disabled all types of enhancements or settings that were auto-enabled in the Radeon Software, yet still nothing changed. I also went and uninstalled MSI afterburner, and any other potentially conflicting 3rd-party applications, but to no avail.

I ended up reinstalling my 1060, and everything is fine again, so I figured I can rule out any other hardware issues.

Being that I purchased this card from Newegg, the card is only eligible for a replacement return policy. I'm unsure if the drivers cause issues with only select RX 5700 XT cards, since it works fine from some but not for others, or if it's solely on the drivers and that my GPU is not the issue.

Would it be worth it to try and get a replacement Sapphire Nitro+, or would it just be a waste of time and shipping cost?",19,1585368702,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fqd2iq/is_it_worth_trying_to_get_a_replacement_for_my_rx/,Amd,1

Got the hardware a month ago and ended up installing POP OS because of the [MCE bug](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Boot-Threadripper-Zen2MCE). Works OK, although there were a couple of issues apparently related to GNOME (1 unexplained system crash, several errors in the system log pointing to GNOME).

So, (1) what is a rock-solid/stable distribution; (2) can it be installed from ISO or do we still have to fiddle with GRUB or the disk image?

I was looking to upgrade parts of my already existing PC or build a new one, posted my list in r/buildapc and someone suggested using AMD parts. I've never used AMD parts as it's been a while since I upgraded and last I had heard AMD GPU&amp;CPU weren't great, were cheaper but performance and heating issues weren't great. So I was wondering if the sub fancied reassuring me in some ways, have the last few years done AMD any good? 

I'll also post the current build list if anyone wants a look/point me in the right direction:

I'd like to start by saying that I have been a fan of AMD product offerings since before it was cool. I have bet for both their GPU's and CPU's, and as a consumer/fan of them, I am pleased where we at right now in the current market. Who doesn't love a good competition when the ""underdog"" now seems to be controlling the game, right?  
I have looked for workarounds, tinker with the software myself, reached out for AMD support (to no avail), even worked with the game support to get these crashes at bay and it has been impossible, nothing has worked, everything that I try to fully enjoy the beast of a card I know this GPU can be has been proven time after time futile, to say the least.   
Every time I find a person in the forums saying that the fix is to return the card and switch to NOVIDEO felt like a personal threat to my faith, a way to test my commitment, my loyalty and my hope that the AMD gods will take pity upon me and release a driver that will bring justice to the nonbelievers and bring them to their knees, but I feel that they have forsaken me (by me I really mean all of us out there waiting for the miracle).  
I have been an owner of this card for 5 months and have grown frustrated with the issue, falling into desperation. If there another one like me please reach out, this is a call for help, my strength is abandoning me, my conviction is wavering. Please let me know that I am not alone. If there are more like me out there weathering the storm, let us all unite as one to call upon the gods and see if we can get through this together because I am sure together we'll succeed separated we'll fail.",17,1585335910,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fq3are/driver_problems_with_radeon_rx_5700xt/,Amd,0

fq28ln,k3tr4b,Upgrading from 8 year old build (i7 3770K) - Need Help!,"Hello,

I've  been out of the game with hardware for quite some time now thus asking  for the advise.  Looking for best build for the $ to replace my good old  3770K. 

**Long story short:**

Since  the beginning I've been with Intel but for this build I think I want to  go team red (not only because performance wise they got better but $  also).

**Budget is tight**  so I'm trying to squeeze most of out the buck. I don't really care much  about i.e: 5 degrees Celsius difference or minor FPS improvement.  **Performance to $ ratio (ROI)  needs to be there.** But if I would have to give you the number we are looking **$900 +-**

Would like to **reduce noise to the minimum** since I'm planing to place the case on the table.

Currently using 34 inch LG monitor (3440x1440) just fyi.

Not really interested in **OCing anymore** and not interested much in **RGB theme.**

Use for this build is a mix of:

\- ""**light""** gaming i.e: csgo, gta5, witcher bf4 - nothing crazy

\- work mostly email, ssh, visio, slack etc.. so nothing intense

\-  1080/4K drone footage editing as a hobby(powerDirector) - I've done 4K  footage editing on my current setup and I didn't really complain but  thought I'll mention it.

**So Far Build(as of 3/27/2020):**

\- **CPU:** [Ryzen 5 3600 ](https://www.microcenter.com/product/608320/Ryzen_5_3600_Matisse_36GHz_6-Core_AM4_Boxed_Processor_with_Wraith_Stealth_Cooler)@ $160 (can't beat microcenter) -  thoughts?

\- **HSF:** Not  sure if I should go with stock or beQuiet (Rock Slim) or Noctua  (nh-u12a) so for the sake @ $65.I don't trust AIO since once I had a  leak and it fried my GPU so... - Thoughts ?

\- **MOBO:** [Gigabyte B450 AORUS M](https://www.microcenter.com/product/510207/B450_AORUS_M_AMD_AM4_mATX_Motherboard) @ $65 (microcenter) - I've also considered [ASRock B450M PRO4](https://www.microcenter.com/product/509732/asrock-b450m-pro4-amd-am4-matx-motherboard)  which would be $5 less than AORUS but my 8 year old rig is running on  Gigabyte and I've never had issues with it. Also I don't see PCIE 4.0 to  be huge at this point so I think B450 is solid - What do you think?

\- **MEM:**  Don't really care much since no OCing so i.e: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16  GB 2400 @ 68 (newegg). Any other company you would recommend?

\- **STORAGE:** I've heard good reviews about [Samsung 970 Evo 500 GB M.2-2280 NVME](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-970-evo-500gb-internal-pci-express-3-0-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-with-v-nand-technology/6252132.p?skuId=6252132)  @ $100. Don't really need 500GB since 256 is plenty but $20 difference  between 256&lt;&gt;500 is no brainier imho thoughts?! I have spare  spinning for data so we good there.

\- **GPU:**  Tough one for me - undecided. Currently running on rx 480 and had  nothing but problems (drivers etc). I don't know if I should just go  back to team green on this one. Perhaps 2060S or 2070S? Need to do more  research if 2070s is worth it that extra $100 +-

\- **CASE:** I  want to go mATX and I have two on my mind: Corsair Crystal 280X @ $95  (non RGB) or  NZXT H510 @ 70 - Anyone with one of these cases that could  share your opinion? I love the isolation for the PSU and cable  management.

\- **PSU:** Another tough one for me. **Estimate Wattage** with this setup is at around **321W (estimated with 2060S).** Primarily  it needs to  be as quite at possible and would like it to be modular  (less cable mess). Was looking at beQuiet PSUs but again I would love to  hear your opinion on this one. For the sake I've looked at [EVGA SuperNOVA](https://www.newegg.com/evga-supernova-650-ga-220-ga-0650-x1-650w/p/1HU-00J7-004V5?Item=1HU-00J7-004V5&amp;nm_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_source=afc-PCPartPicker&amp;AFFID=2558510&amp;AFFNAME=PCPartPicker&amp;ACRID=1&amp;ASID=https%3a%2f%2fpcpartpicker.com%2fproduct%2fXsn8TW%2fevga-supernova-ga-650-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-220-ga-0650-x1&amp;ranMID=44583&amp;ranEAID=2558510&amp;ranSiteID=8BacdVP0GFs-tV4J4DQHQ6lZKs_ib8qXLA) @ $80 ($20 rebate).

That being said rough total so far: **$608‬ (without GPU)?!**

Trying to see how **can this be optimized** and of course your opinion matters!

Building a new PC and am stuck on which GPU to get. I want to choose between the aforementioned GPUs because I also have a Hackintosh partition on the side. I currently have an Rx 580 and a 3770K and it's showing it's age.

I mainly play Fortnite, and want to now play this at 1080p at 144hz, however also getting back into CS:GO and my buddies are also keen on getting on Valorant when it comes out (as well as dabbling in a few other classics like Rainbow 6, GTA, Battlefield etc - basically using this Quarantine to start gaming again as it's been a few years)

I've currently picked up a Vega 56 Sapphire Pulse for £210 Brand new with a year warranty which is quite rare to find these days, however I've read that the 5700 and 5700XT are much better? ***Is it worth therefore getting a 5700 for around £300 or a 5700XT for around £390 or should I stick with the Vega 56?*** 

***I don't want the stress of having to tweak things constantly to get 144hz gameplay on Fortnite, so can someone definitively tell me that the Vega 56 (with an 8700K i7) get 144hz @ 1080p low?***  


I'm basically in need of something till BIG Navi at the end of the year, and therefore don't feel like spending close to £400 on something which in around 8/10 months, for the same price, will deliver better performance.

fpynf4,kirilos,Trixx boost and Radeon GPU scaling settings.,"Hello,  


I've been using TRIXX to achieve optimal 4k performance with my 5700XT and I'm really happy with it.I recently realized what the GPU scaling option does in radeon global display settings so I turned that one and chose center as the scaling mode. When I went back to play a game,i saw that my ""custom"" TRIXX boost resolution was indeed centered, hence I had black bars from all sides when I chose that particular resolution. Let me say here that choosing something like 1080p didn't have the same effect,the screen would fill.   
So my question is, how do these two different settings work with each other? What do I need to do to make sure that trixx boost is doing the upscaling as it should? I was kinda afraid that having the radeon scaling on would mitigate the effects of having trixx boost,is that the case?

&amp;#x200B;

After my PC died (thanks to liquid cooling system busting and killing almost everything) - I build new PC. Decided to go with 3900X (plan to use with RTX 2080, and later update to newer gen of Nvidia).

Question is - I am looking for X570 motherboard below 300 euro that can handle 3900X well (don't plan to overclock myself). I want to go with X570 to have PCIe 4.0 and be future-proof so to say.

Currently found Asus ROG Strix X570-F Gaming - for 250. Is it good? Can anyone recommend anything else?

Also - wi-fi is not crucial for me, as I have very good USB wi-fi from Asus (that can handle up to gigabit).  What would be good - is to have type-c front panel connector (I also would like to know opinion on good cases with type-c that are in below 150 euro, if anyone know)

fpxpop,jackhakken,Vega 56 is still relevant.,"The vega 56 is still a relevant card at the right price, the best price for this is around 150-200dollars used if you can find it around that its a steal. (2020 Jan) If you are not comfortable buying used see the RTX 2060 or 5600 XT for comparable performance. The vega 56 has HBM2 Memory which is most cases is about the same as GDDR6 for gaming however the HBM2 excels in advanced computing tasks. With that said the vega 56 falls behind the new 5600 XT in performance out of the box and considering most cases the vega 56 will be cheaper second hand than a new 5600 XT it is a good alternative. You can undervolt or overclock the vega 56 and tweak it to surpass the 5600 XT in performance. the vega 56 is also faster than the 1660 ti/super and comparable to the RTX 2060 but at a much cheaper price. The vega 56 also has 2 more gigabytes of vram than the 5600 XT and most other cards around the 200-280 price range. 8gbs of VRAM (and fast ram at that) is a very good sweet spot to be at in todays gaming market if you are buying this for gaming. The vega 56 can offer decent 1440p medium/high performance and fantastic 1080p ultra performance. Due to games getting more demanding this card is slowly losing relevancy at 1440p and isn't (imo) considered a 1440p ultra card. (see rtx 2070/super or 5700 XT for a good 1440p card or a used 1080 ti) TL;DR - Vega 56 is a good deal around 180dollars with 8gbs of vram which is a nice sweet spot for todays market. It is also comparable to a lot of newer products at a higher price; if you are comfortable buying used this is a good alternative to consider if you are on the green team considering a used 1070/1070ti - for this is comparable for the same reasons. P.S - buy one that doesn't have a blower-style cooler unless you plan on putting it on water.",25,1585318766,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fpxpop/vega_56_is_still_relevant/,Amd,1

I have a water cooled Radeon VII overclocked to 2010 Mhz core @ 1.132 mV, and 1145 Mhz memory, using the EK-Quantum Vector Radeon VII RGB - Nickel + Plexi full waterblock. I don't have a fan plugged into it's fan header because of this.

I haven't experienced any real issues with the new driver, except the one shown in the picture. A summary of the picture:

  
1. It reads as the fan spinning at 25 RPM (again, no fan is plugged into it)

2. The power draw at 850 watts, the theoretical total maximum power output of my power supply.

3. The junction temperature of 712° C, or 1,313° F. For context, the melting point of aluminum is 660° C, or 1,221° F.

The fact that my computer isn't on fire and melting into a puddle, as well as GPU-Z showing normal results made me think that this is incorrect.

Battlefield V is the game that I play 80% of the time. My old RX570 4gb was doing a decent job keeping constant 60-75 fps with a mix of lower and medium settings @75hz Acer Monitor.

Last week I've decided to invest into a RX5700 non XT Reference model and a MSI Mag271CR @144hz.

Only if I knew the headaches to come.

Plugged the GPU in and DDU old driver + Install 20.3.1
Launched BF V and really bad performance overall but stable Clocks. Horrible stuttering.

DDU + Install 20.2.2
Better performance and less stutter but still very noticeable. Stable clocks

DDU + Install 19.12.1
Good performance but HEAVY Downclock. From 1650mhz to 800mhz without any reason. Forcing the game's Render Resolution to 200% stabilizes clocks but kills the fps.

Every single of this drivers keeps mt GPU usage around 60%, 70 max

At this point I feel like swapping back to my RX570.
**Does anyone please know any driver that really works well with this game??!!!**

**Tried all below but nothing seems to help**
Power State Link is OFF
Mobo Bios is set to PCie 3
Latest Chipset is installed
Disabled MSI afterburner
Freesync on/off
Tried Undervolting the gpu
Tried Overcloking the gpu
Power Limit set to +20%
Ryzen Power Plan selected

The list could go on but I dont really remember everything Ive tried.

Running a R5 2600 + Aorus B450 Pro WiFi + Crucial Ballistix 3000mhz (XMP profile On) + Corsair TXM 650W

fptuah,DecimaI,Black screen crash issue,"As my title says, I got a random black screen crash today which sent me to my lock screen, my mouse and keyboard turned off but the pc itself stayed on. The cpu and fans all keep spinning. This happened a few times when I built my pc about a week ago but after updating my gpu drivers it hadnt happened until today. Here is my build, I did a DDU for my red devil 5700xt to download latest driver update the first day. Not sure what could be causing it, any help is appreciated.

fppwbm,cheek1breek1,Ryzen 5 3600 overclock stable on anything other than Prime95 smallFTT's,"After 6 years of faithful service, I sold my 4670k and installed a 3600 this afternoon. Naturally, the first thing I did was download ryzen master and see how far it would overclock. 

However, there's a pretty large discrepancy between Prime95 and literally anything else I test with; Cinebench R20 managed to complete a 4068 point run at 4.5ghz all cores @ 1.3v (which is quite good for this chip from what I'm reading), as did R15 and AIDA64. Prime95 blackscreened after about 5 seconds. This is a general trend too. At 4.4ghz I had to drop the voltage down to 1.225 to get R20 to black-screen, but at the same speed Prime95 will freeze even when I go to 1.2875. Temps stay around 64C @ 1.25v and around 72C @ 1.275v with smallFTT's so that's not the main issue.

Most of what I plan on doing is play DCS is VR, and from what I'm reading smallFTT's aren't really representative of real-world loads for the cpu.

![video](82eyhev1o4p41)

So today I updated my AMD driver. And only then did it start doing this thing. I have tried it with Borderlands 3, Doom Eternal, and even Minecraft; the flickering/tearing still occurs.

I have attempted to roll back a driver (uninstalled latest driver, reinstalled old one), either the same thing would happen, or Windows 10 would just straight up uninstall everything about the GPU. 

I have attempted a number of different things, including manually uninstalling the new driver, and installing an older one.

This flicker/tear ONLY happens when I'm playing a game.

What is happening and why?

Computer Specs:

CPU: Ryzen 5 2600x 6-core

fpp1m9,Gav0,Memory controller difference in my mediocre 3700x vs 3800x,"I got a slight upgrade recently from a 3700x to 3800x (recent sale + price protection meant it was practically a free upgrade).

I just wanted to share my experience with the difference in memory controllers.

Motherboard: ASUS x570 prime-pro (bios 1405)
RAM: 3466 mt/s 16-18-18-36 CMW32GX4M2C3466C16W (Okay-ish Samsung b-die)

**July 19**
On release of the 3700x I attempted a memory OC. I barely got to 3533 mt/s with some tweaked sub-timings. It took several nights of tweaking and testing to get something that performed decently.

**November 19**
Asus released bios version 1404 and 1405 which seemed to break a lot of people's memory support including my own. 3533 was no longer stable and I just decided to run it at xmp to safe the hassle I had before.

One thing I noticed is that if I decoupled fclk and mclk, my ram could overclock pretty decently but the infinity fabric wouldn't boot at 1800 or higher.

**March 20**
With a shiny new 3800x, I tried 3600MTs, 3733MTs and 3800Mts with loose timings. 3800MTs wouldn't boot but 3733Mts would work fine. Chucked in timings from the ryzen DRAM calculator and the 3733 fast preset works perfectly!

No messing around with sub-timings endlessly, no constant clearing cmos, it just works. Prime95, IBT and memtest have all been passed for 3h, 2h and overnight so i'm cheering!



**Conclusion**
While we can expect silicon quality to increase over time, I think the main take-away is that my 3700x memory controller was lower quality than average and my 3800x was much nicer to work with. YMMV

fpmirk,holywhateverbatman,Stock 3950x crashes with prime95 small FFTs,"Yesterday I built my new PC which consists of:

    Gigabyte X570 Aorus Pro
    Ryzen 9 3950X
    Noctua NH-D15 Chromax.black
    Kingston HyperX Predator 2x16GB 3600MHz CL18
    Gigabyte GTX 1080Ti Aorus Xtreme
    Corsair HX750

CPU is most definitely a BEAST. Considering that I switched from a 9 year old i7 2600k, basically everything that I usually do showed immense performance improvements and I had no issues whatsoever.

However, today I wanted to see if the temperatures are okay and started testing with Prime95. Initially I started with blend which worked for \~20 minutes before the PC simply reset itself. So I disabled the XMP and thought that would be the end of it, reran blend and waited for \~40 minutes and just before I stopped the workers it reset again.

Temps were fine both times, usually at \~65, but peaked at \~83 a couple of times. So I guess that's not an issue. I still wasn't sure what's the issue, so I wanted to make sure that the CPU is fine and ran small FFTs considering that it will mostly stress the CPU and not the memory. 

Aaaand boy was I wrong to assume that RAM was faulty. Immediately after the worker threads are started, PC just resets. And it happens every single time I run small FFTs. It doesn't even do anything, just starts the workers and bails. No BSODs, no freezing, nothing. A quick reset and I'm back at my Windows desktop.

I found a couple of similar issues, and an identical one on AMD community forums which was resolved by getting a new CPU. There was also a workaround mentioned to switch the LLC from Auto to Medium. So I tried that as well. LLC at Low and everything above works just fine with small FFTs. 

I ran it with LLC Low for more than an hour and didn't have any issues. All cores were at \~3580MHz, Vcore was at \~1.02v, temperature at \~60c. Here's a pic of Ryzen Master at that time: [https://i.imgur.com/cpEGc4j.png](https://i.imgur.com/cpEGc4j.png)

Other issues mentioned VRM cooling and CPU overcurrent protection. VRM MOS temps were never above 47 while I did these tests, and Aorus Pro should have sufficient cooling for it. 

I also tried setting the clock to 4200MHz and increasing the Vcore to 1.375, which resulted in small FFTs starting and a complete shutdown after 10 seconds or so. That would indicate a power issue, so I could probably surpass it by using the 4pin CPU connector as well (8pin is obviously already connected).

&amp;#x200B;

I tested In various platforms, (Firestrike, Superposition, gaming like Tomb raider 2 Remastered demo, and Was fine with it. 

I want simply to find a stable clock, keeping the card cooler, and keep the noise down. So I find a Spot with the power draw of the GPU being 180/190W, and I can achieve something like 1510-1530mhz. and keep the GPU temp under 70º But it seems that if I change any value, like change the voltage only 0.10mv or changing one fan from 40% to 43%, basically any value, the card will suddenly draw about 260W.  I have to input the voltages gain,(even if I am inputting the same value) to make the power draw back to normal 180w to 190w. I use HWINFO 64 And msi afterbuner, to watch the values and wattman to make changes.

Its like the card simply out of nothing, ignores the voltages, it makes no sense, one minute is stable, another its sky rocket. I will link my undervolt, its stable tested.

fpfxmn,ASimpleBarista,Simple question for 4th gen ryzen.,"Hello everyone, first of all I'm just getting back into the pc world after a 3-year hiades so apologies if I fuck up some wording.

Anyways, I'm looking into upgrading my system as a whole, CPU / GPU. I'm in no rush of upgrading but  I saw the 3970x, I'm thinking of upgrading once the 4th gen threadripper releases + the RTX 3000 series release. (The wait is for more mainstream PCIe 4th gen, and MAYBE ddr5??) and also once water blocks for the GPU and mobo, + motherboards come out for the new-gen. Looking at the time frame, I don't mind a 1-1.5 year wait for these new techs and also due to the current pandemic I expect there to be a delay in products. 

My thinking of the build,

Case (may switch due to no more parts) Caselabs THW10. 

32 core ryzen 4th gen (whatever the name is gonna be)

1 or 2 RTX 3080ti (if that is the name)

64gb of ram in a 4 or 8 channel (don't mind it tbh)

PCIe 4 1tb boot, 

2, 10tb HDD (Already own these and just going to use them as old storage or videos)

Another PCIe 4 for games. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was also wanting to overclock both GPU and CPU with a motherboard water block and a GPU water block to achieve the highest clocks I could get. (Separate loop, but if only 1 GPU keeps it the same with just a bigger radiator.)

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking for some help and ideas, thank you all as always &lt;3",11,1585244603,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fpfxmn/simple_question_for_4th_gen_ryzen/,Amd,0

My windows rig has 2 x 2080ti since I do a lot of heavy video editing and rendering, so I'm used to high specs.

I currently have a 5700XT set up in an external GPU case for use with a Mac Mini but to be honest I haven't really put it to the test since I don't personally use the Mini that much.

The PC will be used for editing, color grading, offloading camera footage, and the occasional gaming binge. I'm thinking of getting 2 4K monitors or 2 144hz monitors (still not sure if I'm going higher res or fps) so the GPU should be able to handle that.

fpdnmj,matteodream,ryzen 3600 on x370-f strix Motherboard voltage,"Hello, I'll start saying sorry for my english :)  
Anyway, brand new ryzen 5 3600, coming from 2600.

I've got a custom loop with double rads, one 360 and one 240. 1070ti also liquid-cooled.My 2600 was running happily at 4.15 with 1.38-1.39 vcore. Idle temp or while browsing was between 30 and 40c° max, load temp on cinebench just under 70c°, perfectly stable with ram at 3600, tight timings.

I was really happy with my results, days at testing results in good performance.I swapped my 2600 with 3600 (I'm on the latest bios), cmos reset and I left all on auto except for memory XMP profile.

logging into windows I noticed my fan ramping high ""too much"", temp where 50-55c° loading windows and, in idle condition, they won't go lower than 48-46c°. In hwinfo I noticed vcore and single-core voltages almost constantly at 1.4 or more.

I tried everything, I can get almost the same performance fixing vcore at 1.35 and in that case temperatures are actually better than my 2600. If I set anything lower than 1.35 I can get better all core frequency on cinebench than stock but a substantially lower score (???).

In other threads I saw the vcore on bios set to ""normal"" instead of ""auto"" but I don't have that option and strangely with the 3600 a new page appeared in bios, with ram timings setting and PBO (it's on the secondary settings page, where you change drive settings, pci-ex and usb stuff. If you click on it you must accept the AMD disclaimer for overclocking and then the new page open), if I change something in this section it appears that nothing happens, tried with ram timings, the main page for overclocking works fine but still, I don't get it. I can basically change timings, ram voltages and PBO in two sections with options that are almost the same but literally written in a different manner. very strange.

anyway, I tried also setting s4 and s5 state (I don't have ""amd cool'n'quiet option), high-performance energy profile on windows, balanced, lowering Vcore setting to a negative offset, but nothing changes the high voltages and temp, only fixing the voltage at 1.35 but I don't think this is the right way to have the best overall performance and make PBO works as it should.   
with PBO and ""auto"" vcore my CPU on cinebench requires 180w, with 1.35 and PBO it doesn't go higher than 140w. This is why I'm going crazy trying to understand this.

it's just my motherboard or am I missing something? or is it totally normal? the voltages can go lower yes, but they stay almost constantly at 1.4 or more resulting in very high idle temps and I don't get why I have so much higher idle temps than my stretched overclock on 2600.

and please don't just respond ""leave it all stock"", I've been in pc's world since 1998 and always overclocked stuff, for fun and for science :D",10,1585237254,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fpdnmj/ryzen_3600_on_x370f_strix_motherboard_voltage/,Amd,1

fpccou,Shinkenshi,Vega 64 MSI Afterburner Voltage,"Let me preface this by saying that Wattman hard reboots my PC no matter what voltage I set for my Vega 64. Stock, undervolt, overvolt, doesn't matter. Seconds to minutes into some games like Elite Dangerous it hard reboots. I have reached out to AMD and all they have to say is that your PSU is faulty and that there is nothing wrong on their end. You can guess what Corsair told me... that I have a faulty GPU. This is why I resorted to using MSI Afterburner. For some reason, the hard reboot never happens while using Afterburner, so good job AMD support.... /rant

Anyways, what I want to ask about is this. MSI Afterburner doesn't let me set the voltage directly but has a slider from -200 to +200 mv, I think. Can only confirm the -200mv as I never tried to overvolt. What I noticed is that there seems to be two stock voltage states for my Vega 64. Setting it at 0mv will sometimes put my voltage at 831mv and 1050mv at other times. Over time, I tend to see 1050mv more often than not, but 831mv value pops up often enough at startup I cannot reliably set one profile and forget it. If anyone has any insight on what triggers the change or if there is a way to force one or another that will be great. Running -200mv at 0.85v and maintaining essentially stock clock is great. When it sets me to 631mv however it's obviously not so great and any game will crash almost immediately until I readjust the voltage or significantly underclock.

This is the card I have. [https://www.msi.com/Graphics-card/Radeon-RX-Vega-64-Air-Boost-8G-OC](https://www.msi.com/Graphics-card/Radeon-RX-Vega-64-Air-Boost-8G-OC)",0,1585232676,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fpccou/vega_64_msi_afterburner_voltage/,Amd,1

I also experience this many times, but I can't proof this.

And desktop view there is almost no different between Nvidia and AMD GPU.

But in the games, there are different.

&amp;#x200B;

I choose two games to test. First is DOA6 (Maybe same with Nioh2) , Second is RE3.

See the Geforce and Radeon and PS4 Gamma setting view.

Bottom line is gamma changer and TeamNija icon is need to view.

As you see Radeon and PS4 has SAME default gamma.

&amp;#x200B;

And I also took picture at same setting(All same Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO, White Balance)

[https://imgur.com/a/sQE1rjp](https://imgur.com/a/sQE1rjp)

Sure, In game settings also same. 

Radeon has more vivid color.

&amp;#x200B;

And I heard there is missing feature on Geforce.

fpbdlo,SirActionhaHAA,"3900x cpu cooler ramps up sharply for a split second, no change in temperature. Why?","I run a 3900x on a gigabyte x470 gaming 7 board.

Fan curve is a flat horizontal line till 65C. Hwinfo records that the cpu temperature never exceeded 60C (maximum), but once every 15 minutes or so I hear a sharp ramp up on the cpu fan. 

Looked back at hwinfo again and it showed that the cpu fan ramped up from 700rpm to 1200rpm just for a split second. Rechecked temps, cpu tdie and die average shows 60C maximum (not current).

To confirm that something odd is going on I let the system sit on desktop with no applications running, temps are at 38C. Again after 15 minutes the fan ramps up to 1200rpm for a split second. 1200rpm is the exact rpm of the next point on the smartfan curve (700rpm 40C, 700rpm 65C, 1200rpm 75C).

fpad01,_conzzooo_,Screen stutter every two seconds on windows but not in Safe Mode.,"Thanks for reading and please bare with me, as I'm not hugely competent when it comes to computing.

So I have a HP-15af157na Laptop which recently crashed, and windows was completely removed. I managed to get Windows back on using image recovery.

Since it's been back up and running, the screen stutters roughly every 2 seconds, but doesn't seem to affect audio. 

I've tried many 'fixes' that I've read online, but still no joy.

The closest I got to fixing the issue was by running the AMD auto detect program. The program removed my current AMD Radeon R5 graphic driver, then before it reinstalled it, the screen didn't stutter at all. After it had reinstalled the driver, the stutter began again.

I opened the Radeon Software, and clicked on the performance tab, and every time I move the mouse, the screen stutters and the GPU spikes up to 100%.

As mentioned in the title, I booted up into safe mode, and the stuttering stops completely.

Any ideas on what could be causing this? I'm bored in isolation and in need of a working laptop!

I ran Karhu for 1h30 4000% coverage no errors (not chekced other issues).

fp8mcz,SafetySquintz,Here is what I've done to my MSI 5700 XT MECH OC to try and keep it cool (long post),"TLDR: Added 1.5mm fujipoly 13mk/W + stacked 0.5mm on top and put plastic washers behind die screws, memory junction temps dropped considerably. Wasn't happy with GPU junction temp still. Lapped/wet sanded heatsink with 1000-5000 grit paper. Pasted with Kryonaut. Results were kinda better. I'd say it's only worth changing the thermal pads and repasting, no lapping needed.

All these tests were done without touching wattman/Radeon software, card was installed in a Corsair 250D case with a 140mm Noctua intake, 2 80x15mm slim exhaust fans and having the H100iV2 pull in air rather than push out with 2 Noctua 120mmx15mm slim fans installed on radiator, an ASUS ROG STRIX X370-I and R5 1600X OC'd to 3.9GHZ. 16GB g.skill memory OC'd and timings/voltage changed. Fans/pump all at 100%.

Pics of what I did and results [https://imgur.com/a/Rf9Mm8s](https://imgur.com/a/Rf9Mm8s)

[http://www.3dmark.com/tsst/968363](http://www.3dmark.com/tsst/968363) TimeSpy Extreme Stress test results

So I posted previously about this card and using 1.5mm thick instead of 2mm thick pads well here is what I've done to it so far to try and keep it cool. 

First I thought the 1.5mm Fujipoly pads I had would make good enough contact and help cool the memory chips. Well they didn't and had same issue as the original pads, memory junction really hot, over 100 degrees.

So being bored and also stuck at home cause the world's a mess, let's try to optimize this already weakly designed heatsink/card. Since I didn't get good enough squish with 1.5mm pads, my 2mm minus 8 pads are in the mail still and I'm impatient I decided to stack some 0.5mm Fujipoly pads on top of the 1.5mm ones (same line and thermal rating). Well that did wonders,squished good and the memory Junction didn't go over 100 degrees, I ran some unigine heaven on ultra 1080P for 15 minutes. I decided to not touch the AMD settings yet to optimize voltage, etc. I wanted to see how AMD/MSI does their thing. Then I see 3DMark on sale for $5, sold. Now new set of tests/data to run and can post links to verified scores.

I run the stress test of TimeSpy and TimeSpy Extreme, then final test was Unigine Heaven DX11 1080P Extreme for 15 minutes, then I also snipped the measured values of temps from HWinfo64 for readings. So was all this work worth it? Replacing the pads yes, lapping, no.If you enjoy tinkering maybe and getting most out of your hardware, for me I like messing with stuff. Seeing the memory go down that much was very worth it. Even after lapping the GPU junction still got up there. So I guess the heatsink is just not up to snuff and my case is small with poor airflow. Your results may vary and probably be better. If I had lowered voltage, changed fan curve, etc  I could have gotten better results but this for the person that leaves Radeon settings on default/automatic and doesn't touch any of that.

Hopefully this was somewhat informational/enjoyable and not a useless post cause of the issue people already know about the poor pad placement by MSI thanks to GN Evoke video. I know this wouldn't be considered truly accurate data compared to a GN result since i didn't set fan @ fixed value and etc but I'd say this would be like a normal use case scenario of you're average gamer.",9,1585215131,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fp8mcz/here_is_what_ive_done_to_my_msi_5700_xt_mech_oc/,Amd,1

I really don't want to bite my words but after recording several clips in PUBG and Warzone and analyzing the output files i can say with 99% confidence the issue has been fixed.

Why i say 99%? Because specifically in the recordings of Warzone audio bitrate was not constant (fastest indication i've discovered to check for corrupted clips before the fix), however there was none noticeable audio corruption/distortion under playback. (I think it might have to do with the fact that Warzone plays a video file at the start of the game)

I know 2 games is not a good sample size so if you still encounter any issues please let us know. 

Huge thanks again to /u/AMD-DOWNL1NK and the other AMD employee that i cannot find his username for taking care of it :)",35,1585205160,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fp6u9k/huge_thanks_to_radeon_staff_for_finally_fixing/,Amd,1

I recently bough Asus Rog Strix RX590 GPU and I have questions regarding it, could you please help me out?
Straight out of the box, with the latest adrenalin drivers the GPU is not working correctly, constantly crashing in all games (black screen PC works, but monitor is not) if I don't mess with any settings, reaching about 75-80 degrees and seems like fans even won't start to rotate.
However, if I add a custom fan curve it doesn't crash but it gets really noisy.
So the question is, is it supposed to be this way?
And why can't it work with default settings?

When the screen returns to normal, any video / game running at the time will cease to work, and I'll have to force close out of everything.

foy8qc,alexp1289,Freesync 2 help,"Hey guys I just got a new monitor that has freesync 2 technology. I'm wondering if I need to have vsync on while freesync 2 is on or if I don't need it at all because my monitor only goes to 144 Hertz. My graphics card is a GTX 1080 so it is compatible. Is there any need for vsync to be on with freesync enabled or do I just need to have freesync turned on and I won't ever have to worry about touching vsync? It's just a little bit confusing because I thought that Visa capped your frame rate at whatever your monitor was capable of so I didn't know if I needed to have vsync on to cap it at 144 Hertz and then freesync would take care of anything below that I'm just a little confused about how this all works and what settings I should apply to games for the best results. Also my monitor is a 34-inch ultra-wide 3440x1440 resolution if that's of any help. I already did the firmware update that my monitor said I needed to do so that's all set and I'm using the included DisplayPort cable that came with the monitor I literally just got it today.

It annoyed me but I let it go in the end. Why i want a silent case was more because of the gpu coil whine. I went from 2080s to 2080ti msi ventus to now 2080ti rog strix and all of them had/have annoying amount of coil whine. 

Today I was messing with the pcie cables and i (for some reason) swapped the places of the end connectors (2 x 6+2). On boot the fans spin for like a sec at low speed producing almost no sound?! The revving stopped!?

They claimed that this event ""***is not core to the competitiveness or security of our graphics products***"".

But is it?

What do you think about this ""incident"" guys? Should Navi owners be afraid of consequences, if any? Were there other cases of driver stealing during NVIDIA/AMD competition?

My opinion:

Navi cards are garbage at some point, drivers STILL need to get fixed. Me and my friend with 5700 XT, on 20.3.1 driver, having sick blackscreen artifacts in Opera, where other friends of mine have none of problems, and this is not acoincidence. Some things are still broken. My previous experience with RX 590 was great and damn stable, but as for Navi cards... I think they are cursed, and this incident proves it.

fouxvo,Nobulilo,Tech problems with vulkan games startup,"Hello everyone, i don't know if i can post it here, i don't know how to use reddit so well yet  
I've been searching a solution for a while, but i can't find nothing similar on web that solves the problem in my side.

I can't use vulkan games in my computer, basically every game or application that uses vulkan as render, closes immediately.  
Some examples are: Cemu (In cemu, i have to try a lot of times until the game finally open, Doom Eternal doesn't even start, Dolphin Emulator closes right at the moment i put Vulkan as render in any version of Dolphin)  
I Do not have any problems in any game or application that uses OpenGL or DirectX(10,11,12), but vulkan would be better in terms of performance in my scenario.

And in case of Cemu, when the emulation manage to start the game, and the game is able to open (without closing at beginning, of course) the game runs fine and smooth, but until i get to this part i have to insist a thousand times until open.

I would like to play Doom Eternal but, the game uses vulkan as main render so... pff.

I already made a **clean installation of my GPU driver (DDU)**, disabled antivirus, disabled some startup programs and services on windows. I've used malwarebytes to scan virus, nothing wrong with computer so far.  
I had **downloaded and installed VulkanRT** too but, not worked at all.

I'm searching for a solution before format my computer (Because the computer runs fine, without any errors, bugs and performance problems, honestly i don't want to format the computer **only because of this** ;-; )  
Past year, i've been able to use vulkan normally without any problem, i think is some kind of windows 10 update, idk.  
My specs are:

Ryzen 5 3600  
Rx 580

16GB Ram.

My AMD Driver is **updated** to the latest version (20.3.1)

fotyv3,KmacL122,Issues with AMD Radeon Software and FreeSync,"Hey everyone. I hope all is staying safe and continue to be well during this hard time.

Recently, I built my first computer centered around a 3600x, B450 Tomahawk Max, and an RX 5700XT. I downloaded the new drivers for everything and all is fine for the most part.

I also am using a Viewsonic VX2758-2kp-mhd 144hz 1440p monitor.

When I try to fine tune my graphics in AMD Radeon Software, it wont allow me to enable FreeSync as it says its not supported by my monitor which I know isn't true because the monitor is displayed everywhere for sale as a freesync enabled monitor.

As a result, I do have frame drops and tearing in games like Fortnite but no issues for the most part that my untrained eye can detect in my other games such as BF5, Cities Skylines etc.

Any tips on what I can do? The only thing I suspect may be the issue is that I am using a Displayport connection and not an HDMI connection that came with the monitor but me not knowing much, I assumed display port was the way to go.

I appreciate any help I can get here. Thank you!",0,1585156118,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fotyv3/issues_with_amd_radeon_software_and_freesync/,Amd,1

fotbrg,StrixKuriboh,Radeon relive broken. Vega 64 .,My Radeon relive has been broken for at least two and a half months now. After a driver update the frame rate went to absolute s*** during recording playback. The far left and right borders were cut off the screen for some reason as well. That and color quality kind of suffered as well. Since then I've always use the most up-to-date drivers but nothing has fixed the problem. One version of The 2020 drivers fix the frame rate issues after updating. However upon trying to record again I immediately got a 5 FPS recording so it fixed it for 5 seconds and broke again. I would really like to fix this as I do want to record gameplay footage of Half-Life Alyx. Many of my friends in quarantine really want to play it but can't do to not owning a hmd and not being able to come to my place.

Seems like Ryzen really is really sensitive and doesn't like high voltages.

SoC Voltage unchanged, 1.10v
VDDP was around 1.10v =&gt; 0.900v seems stable af.
VDDG CCD &amp; IOD were around 1.15v =&gt; 1.025

I really believe that dialing voltages helped me get the overclock stable and got 0 errors during memtest86.

radeon RX 5700 Red Devil (non XT)

850W corsair RM850x PSU

let me explain, I have the Radeon RX 5700, a few days ago I upgraded to version 20.3.1 of radeon drivers, and only trouble and nothing but headaches and blue screens of deaths has happened, since I updated, I couldn't have played ANY game for more than 15 minutes (call of duty MW was an exception from some reason, all other games crashed within reaching 10 minutes of gameplay on the same session), the computer would just throw random BSOD's (when I searched online for these problems, they ALL had something to do with faulty drivers...)  


It would randomly screw up my audio when I was listening to music, it would just screech for 3 or more seconds and then return to normal, it would (once again) make the screen go black and would force me to reboot.  


in short. I ddu'd this 20.3.1 driver, and installed 20.2.1, and so far these issues aren't happening anymore, to be honest, it hasn't happened to me since I first bought the RX 5700 and those kind of issues appeared only for the first few days of use and was gone with a driver update, and once again returned with version 20.3.1, my PC ran fine before this update, I didn't have any trouble before, but again, version 20.3.1 screwed it up, and as far as I can tell, my specs are more than capable of running most things",15,1585149370,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/forzoo/radeon_drivers_version_2031_completely_screwed_up/,Amd,1

I have tried to install the drivers on my XFX 5600XT but whenever I try and update them it gets to 66% then the screen goes black and does nothing. When I press the restart button Windows starts to load, but then the loading circles freeze and I can't get on, so I have to go into the BIOS and re-install Windows from a USB.  


I've had to reset my PC 10 times before writing this, and have tried everything. Updating BIOS, removing old drivers with DDU, disabling automatic Windows updates and it's still the exact same every time.

fonpy1,jaaval,about overclocking ryzen 3600,"This might end up being a bit of a rant...

I've run my 3600 at stock speed with a stock cooler for a while but now i installed it to a watercooled system so why not overclock? After coming from the safe and easy world of overclocking intel CPUs let's just say that the experience of overclocking ryzen 3000 was... weird. 

Issue 1: There is a shitload of conflicting information around. Like really. Everyone seems to disagree about how you should do things. And when looking for help the first results are early articles where they overclocked it like it was an intel CPU and the next results are people saying you should not do that.

Issue 2: People now say that you should just enable PBO and leave it like that. PBO apparently does the job better than you can manually. Except PBO doesn't seem to do jackshit. It doesn't matter if i enable it in bios or in ryzen master. I get the ~4150 MHz single core speed and ~3950 MHz all core speed that i got at stock operation with stock cooler. With water the CPU is around 30c cooler but not at all faster. No changes in benchmark scores. Same goes for ryzen master auto overclock. Absolutely no change in performance.

So at this point i decide that this PBO thing is full of shit and just go for the manual route like i would have with intel. 

Issue 3: I don't know who designed the current ryzen master UI but let's just say that he doesn't deserve a raise. And who the fuck puts features that don't work in the UI? Ryzen master clearly let's you do per clock multipliers and even lists which cores are good and which are not but doesn't tell you that per core overclocking doesn't work with these CPUs. WTF? I had to google why the speeds were all wrong after spending an hour trying to understand the stupid software. 

Issue 4: Ryzen master stress test is bullshit. It doesn't do anything useful. Completely unstable settings seem pass it easily. 

After a while of tweaking i end up with all core 4200MHz at 1.29V. This passed all tests and was in every test significantly faster than what PBO did (or failed to do). I actually got 4400MHz all core to work but it needed uncomfortable voltages for the worst cores to pass in prime95 small fft test. Which brings us to the fact that no one seems to have any idea what kinds of voltages these CPUs can take. People say 1.3V is too high even though the stock operation seems to be practically always over 1.3V. Does anyone know what the latest idea of safe voltage override is?

Issue 5: This one goes for ASUS and not AMD and is not actually AMD specific although i find intel options a lot clearer. There are a million bios settings and all of them are set to ""AUTO"" with no indication of what AUTO is. Having multiple different auto overclocking settings in bios set to ""AUTO"" is just wrong. In every way wrong. If anyone who designs the bios interfaces is listening: You can have a default option but it needs to clearly state which one it is.

Turing's HW encoder is pretty excellent and blows any currently-available Radeon equivalent out of the water. Navi was pretty good at other aspects of encoding/decoding but for some reason after they scrapped VCE things went south in several ways when it came to their x264 encoder. It's odd how they marketed Navi towards streamers when one of the main things that would benefit streamers, the x264 encoder, is like the worst part of the whole package when it comes to their HW encode capabilities. 

Yes, having a high-core count CPU and doing the x264 with that would be ideal for quality, but not everybody would be able to afford those CPUs.

But the other night I got back from a long day, wanted to play Witcher 3 for a bit on my 5600XT rig, had DDU'd and installed the new drivers recently...And bam, black screen after 10 mins in a cutscene.

Red devil 5600XT, no issues on overwatch, Ori, but random crashes on some games. 

It's the randomness of it that's annoying, and if you have limited spare time it can be a real headache. You have an hour to game, and 10mins or so is lost because of a random blackscreen and you have to hard reset. But the really difficult thing is thinking in your head, maybe I can do something. Maybe I can fix it. That's the real time sink! Because you might be right, but you have no way of knowing. It's so temperamental. 

So I Just ordered a 1080Ti from amazon for £340, only £60 more than my 5600XT anyway. It was a good ride, but I had issues on my 5700XT and 5600XT rigs and I just cba anymore.

foe7au,Last_Jedi,What can be AMD's answer to DLSS?,"DLSS had a bit of a rough launch with initial comparisons showing that it was worse than simply upscaling a lower resolution. It also had limited compatibility and required game-specific inputs.

However, Nvidia recently demoed a new and improved DLSS ""2.0"" which, if it works as shown, seems to be the real deal by providing a significant performance boost *and* improved image quality over even native rendering. It also no longer needs Nvidia to generate algorithms for each game, so compatibility should become much more widespread.

Unlike Gameworks which was always a big performance hit even on Nvidia cards, DLSS looks like it'll be a clear performance boost for Nvidia cards over otherwise similarly performing AMD cards.

I know AMD has Radeon Image Sharpening but my impression of that is that it can improve sub-native resolution rendering but not to the point of exceeding native resolution rendering.

*Potentially*, I can see this hurting AMD higher mid-range and upper products, because it can almost raise Nvidia cards to the next higher tier in games with DLSS&gt;",28,1585087330,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/foe7au/what_can_be_amds_answer_to_dlss/,Amd,1

OS: Windows 10 version 1607

My GPU clocks tend to bounce up and down occasionally. on top of that, watching youtube holds my GPU's core clock somewhere higher than it's idle of 300 Mhz. My Memory clock sometimes spikes to 1000Mhz for just a moment. this is when my computer is idling and not doing anything intensive.

here's the thing: everything's fine when it comes to running games, there's no throttling and my temperatures stay at their expected levels. there's no real issues caused by this. my temps when watching youtube go up slowly because it's around 35C and my fan curve hasn't started yet.

I'm asking this is because this wasn't happening in previous driver updates, the clocks would almost never budge when idle or when watching YT, and this issue has persisted through both driver updates and rollbacks. Is there something I should do (more DDUs and using other drivers) or am i just way too concerned over this?

currently running a fresh install of the 20.1.3 drivers. this would happen on my old RX 480 as well.

Next thing, we have the [5600XT ASUS TUF Gaming](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-TUF-DisplayPort-Axial-tech-TUF-3-RX5600XT-O6G-EVO-GAMING/dp/B083WD3DK6/ref=sr_1_11?crid=36HM6A1UU57GK&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=5600%2Bxt&amp;qid=1585082112&amp;sprefix=5600%2Caps%2C152&amp;sr=8-11&amp;th=1), arguably the worst AIB you could get based on the in-depth review on the internet, both the 5500XT and 5600XT ASUS TUF Gaming on the listing have their own review rating linked to the RX570 Expedition which had really good average overall rating.

One more listing, these [5500XT and 5600XT THICC](https://www.amazon.com/XFX-Thicc-1620MHz-Graphics-RX-56XT6DFD6/dp/B083FWMZ8Z/ref=sr_1_2?crid=36HM6A1UU57GK&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=5600%2Bxt&amp;qid=1585082112&amp;sprefix=5600%2Caps%2C152&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1) , were combined and selling under the name and influence of 5700XT THICC.

foc6ii,SpaceDiver79,"Tried undervolting my Ryzen 5 3600, confused about the results","I was trying to see if I could get lower temps on my Ryzen 5 3600, and I remember reading in the past about undervolting helping people achieve that while also lowering power consumption and maintaining similar performance. 

On my Asus Strix B450-F Gaming I changed the CPU V-Core from Auto to Offset, selected the “-” sign and then punched in a 0.05 value. Testing with Cinebench R20, I was pleased to notice with Ryzen Master both a small decrease in temperatures (from about 70-71c to 68, rarely reaching toward 69) and a small bump in score (from 3620-3640 to 3650-3670), despite some slightly lower, albeit in a more stable range, clocks (from 4060-4080 mhz to 4050-4060).

This is however where it got confusing. Looking at the V-Core while testing I noticed that despite the negative V-Core offset, it actually went up from 1.35v to ~1.375v (seldom spikes to 1.38v). Shouldn’t higher V-Core result in higher temperature? 

Since during RAM overclocking I encountered what I think are a couple bugs (I can’t get SOC Voltage to change from its 1.087v end value despite the offset, and if I change cLDO VDDP Voltage to any value the field just resets), I thought that my motherboard’s V-Core offset setting might be bugged, so to test it I applied a positive 0.05v offset (in the bios I switched from “-” to “+”). 

The results were to me even weirder. During Cinebench testing, despite the positive offset, the V-Core actually went *down* to a relatively consistent 1.31v but temperature went back up again to 70-71c, basically what I had with V-Core set on Auto (1.35v). Not only that, but clocks went down to 4000-4020 mhz, and the Cinebench score also was lower (3600-3610). 

I even went back and tested everything again, the above results were consistent across multiple tests and restarts with the exception of V-Core on Auto Cinebench scores, which somehow jumped from the initial 3620-3640 to 3640-3660, despite no other changes (I have no clue about that). 

I tried summing it all up in a table, hopefully it's easier to absorb: 

 |Auto|-0.05v|+0.05v                        
:--|:--|:--|:--                              
**V-Core**|1.35|1.37|1.31     
**Temps**|70-71c|68-69c|70-71c
**Clocks**|4060-4080|4050-4060|4000-4020
**R20 Score**|3640-3660 (initially 3620-3640)|3650-3670|3600-3620 

Is this behavior normal? Something I’m missing here? As I said I was glad to see temperatures dropping and performance stay the same (or even improving), but I'm worried about the now higher V-Core. 

Thanks in advance for any help!

**tl;dr**: see the above table. -0.05 V-Core offset causes higher V-Core but lower temps during testing, with a small bump in performance. The opposite (+.0.05v) causes higher/Auto temps, lower clocks and lower performance.

fobhm5,NecklessDuck,Motherboard for AMD Ryzen 3600,"Hi! I'm looking to buy the new AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (or 3600x if there is a sale).

I have been researching non-stop lately and have found that many people recommend the MSI B450 Tomahawk Max or the MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon AC.

From what I could tell many of these posts debated on whether or not the extra $30-$40 was worth it. For me, I'm not going to be using the wireless WiFi and the bluetooth doesn't matter either. I'm mainly going to be doing some light gaming with the occasional AAA title.

I also saw some posts saying that the Tomahawk Max worked well with the Ryzen 5 because of some updated BIOS. I don't know if there has been any changes with how well these motherboards work with the newer processors because a lot of posts I've read are 3+ months old.

Also, I see some combo deals on Newegg and a lot of them come with other B450 or even X570 boards. Are any of these worth it?

If the X570 boards aren't worth it for what I am doing, do you have any recommendations for cheaper motherboards that will pair well with the Ryzen 5 3600? My budget isn't too tight but I would like to spend less than $150 on a motherboard if possible.

I had to pay for the shipment there, but they paid for the shipment back. It cost me $8 from USPS to get it there in 2 days.

Not even 5 days later, I get a (seemingly) brand new card back. I can't tell if it is new or not, but it looks spotless. I could **not** believe that their turn-around time was that fast! I called them up to thank them and they were extremely nice despite the current condition of the world.

I've recently upgraded my pc with a ryzen7 2700, Gigabyte x470 Aorus Gaming Ultra and G.Skill Trident Z 2x8GB 2600Mhz and i ran into some problems.

First of all the boot is extremely low, it takes almost 4 minutes to start Windows and after few seconds it restart automatically withous any reason, i've updated the BIOS to the latest version (F50), disabled the CMS and enabled XMP but it didn't work out.

The other problem is about the rgb lighting, it's not crucial but i have it so let's make it work. I've tried the Gigabyte software, RGB Fusion but it doesn't work, i pick the wave profile and after 5 second resets and the leds goes unsynchronized, it goes in conflict with the G.Skill lighting control software and the graphic card simply does what she likes. I've tried Asus Aura and it only detect the RAM, after that i tried the lighting control in the BIOS and after that the mobo and fan leds are static and they doesn't respond to any profile.

I looked for a solution online and asked to my friends but i didn't found a solution to any of these.

For more information i have a Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2060, a Cooler Master TD500 and a Crucial MX500",0,1585069317,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fo8m1m/problems_with_aorus_x470_gaming_ultra/,Amd,1

1. Integer scaling at 1080p
2. No integer scaling at 1080p with RIS
3. Trixx Boost with a custom resolution scaling with RIS

Also, if I choose 1080p as my resolution of choice, would that be the same thing as choosing 4K with 50% scaling, or does the game have to specifically support resolution scaling for it to look good?

I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for the global tuning on the Radeon settings app or maybe any other suggestions that can help me to resolve this problem.

I have already used an air duster to try and clear out as much debris as I could.

Corsair LPX Ram 2x8gb 3000
Gigabyte 5700XT OC 8GB
Silverstone 650w sfx psu 
Windows 10 1909
Samsung 34 inch uwqhd monitor 

Now, I bought the 5700xt in Jan and have had plenty of troubles gaming, browsing chrome (hardware acceleration off) and even just turning on my pc. I have been away from home for work for a fair amount of it so never really spent time trying to fix it and can't return under 30 day period now.

My issues are stock standard. BSOD everytime I use an old driver, black screen and crashes while browsing or just opening up a game. It's gotten to the point where I can't use my PC at a unless I don't have a gpu driver installed.

This is what I've done to try and fix it: ensure bios is up to date, updated chipset (Jan and march versions), tried a plethora of driver versions 19.11.1, 19.12.2, 20.1.4, 20.2.2, 20.3.1 is what I remember. I've tried installing them using the extract method and device manager. (Sidenote, I regularly use DDU). I've even tried fresh windows install, let the updates run, update chipset and update driver and it still crashes ~5 mins after I start the pc.

So I'm pretty much pleading for assistance. Is there anything I'm missing, is there anyone that has a method that works for them, is it my PSU, is it my monitor, can someone guide me on how I can make my pc operational without switching to Nvidia.

To those that read all this, thanks. To those that responded as well, thank you very much.

Hopefully we can get my system up and running soon.

fo4uei,ThatRandomGreekDude,Bypassing the 1820mhz limit on RX5600XT," Hello everyone!

I built my PC today, with the XFX RX5600XT THICCBOI 3 Ultra and an R53600 for 1440p gaming. It's running well with the new bios installed, pinned at 1820mhz core and 1800mhz memory.

I was wondering however, whether it would be possible to bypass the 1820mhz limit since some reviewers point out it was artificially set by AMD so that this card wouldn't compete with the RX5700. You obviously can't flash the RX5600XT to an RX5700, but how about another custom bios allowing for +50% (or more?!!) power limit, and clocks above 1820mhz? I couldn't find anything on Google, and AFAIK no one has done this thus far.

Who do you think would be able to make such a bios if it was possible? Is there a point? Soft PPT doesn't work unfortunately.",19,1585055398,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fo4uei/bypassing_the_1820mhz_limit_on_rx5600xt/,Amd,1

fo41bz,anullu,Shoud I OC/UC my RX 580 or not ?,"Hi everybody. Ive been trying to find the answer in this sub before I create this post, but  I am really getting mixed messages here.

It goes from ""UC only helps your electricty bill"" to ""your card will become better with less voltage"" (??)

So let me explain the situation.

My GTX1080 recently broke down out of the blue.  I put back in my old GTX970 and it is doing surprisingly well. However the 4GB VRAM limits me pretty much in high quality textures and the downgrade just annoys me.

Since I dont have the money right now to buy another high end card for 500+€, I was looking for a nice compromise and the RX580 got my attention.  So I was able to buy a brand new one for 140€ :) 

My question now: Do I OC or do I UC ?! **My only goal is to get as much performance and FPS as possible out of the card** for the next 6+ months until I can get a better one. I am having quite a few problems to understand how and why this card will become better with UC. Especially with the mixed opinions.

I was curious if anyone could assist me with some voltage concerns that I am having with my newer 3800x system / cpu.

I've read online that the max voltage for the Ryzen 3000 series is 1.5v in low duties vs roughly 1.325 for heavy loads, I've noticed that my ASUS Strix x570-E is routinely hitting these upper limits and to me it almost looks as if it's going over. Additionally, from looking at HWiNFO it seems like my EDC limit is a crazy %? For the most part I've got everything set to auto outside of two settings. One, I've set an offset of -0.050 and two I've set PBO from auto to enabled.

Here's two screenshot from running Cinebench20 on it's standard, multi-core test.

As you can see it looks like it's pulling over 1.325 though the SV12 shows exactly 1.325. Below are two shots while gaming and the voltages seem a bit more in-line with general use/boosting I think?

fo1wu1,bilog78,AMDNIT [vent/rant],"So recently my old home server had PSU issues, and I decided to took the opportunity to set up a new full AMD build to replace it. I've been MASSIVELY unlucky: the first mobo was malfunctioning, so I asked for a replacement. When I got the new one, I had some troubles slotting the CPU in (red flag!), and ultimately it didn't work either. So I've asked for another replacement and when the NEW new one arrived and I set up to slot the CPU in, I noticed dented pins in one of the CU corners. FFFFFF...

So now I have to get a replacement CPU, and I don't know if I can ask for reimbursement or not. PLUS, I feel bad about the dented pins because WTH, the CPU is still good, isn't there a way to recycle these electronics? Can I send it back to AMD so that they can at least recycle the chiplets?

So the first day back she was playing Black desert for around 3 hours before it bluescreened. She contacted me with a picture of the screen with the error code `irql_not_less_or_equal` which translates to memory issues. This was the first of many crashes until the system would not make it past the BIOS load and was only able to be taken to automatic repair (which doesnt work either. you couldnt even be taken to safe mode) and the rest of the crashes werent recorded except these;

 `DPC_Watchdog_Violation`

 `Critical_Process_Died` 

&amp;#x200B;

So that (to me) narrowed the problem down to Memory and a potential SATA issue. I went to her house to fix it and left today having done these things and getting it completely up and running again like it was for a day and a half before it began crashing:

&amp;#x200B;

* Re-seated the memory (maybe they were displaced during travel somehow)
* Moved SATA ports from 1 to 3 because the MOBO uses 2 SATA for the NVME (my mistake)
* Flashed the BIOS to the most recent update on the website
* Updated the graphics driver
* And reinstalled windows (because none of the repair options worked I thought maybe the install had corrupted somehow)

I am really at a loss past this. After all of those fixes, I left today in hopes that nothing would happen but because I worry so much I had a sneaking suspicion something would break again and I was right. 3 hours into gaming on the system the computer froze up and dropped to 0 FPS in game and she was forced to shut it off. She's booted it back up and is watching YouTube on it currently but she was able to do this after the first crash anyway the first go around. I would really like some help on this.

Now I didn’t have 2mm grizzly ones like he had (mine are in the mail) but decided to take a chance and use my 1.5mm Fujipoly Extreme pads (13mk/w) and cut all new pads and put them on the chips (these pads aren’t as squishy as the pads I pulled off, more firm and aren’t as squishy) and also on the small rear heatsink that runs across the card. Added Kryonaut to the die and slapped it back together with some plastic washers behind the 4 die screws.

Decided to “break in” in the paste and pads by upping the power limit and OC’d to get it nice and hot. Let it cool, will probably do another heat cycle just because and then actually test out some games rather than just running a looping benchmark.

Anyone else do the thermal pad swap on an MECH OC card and have good results? And what did you use as for as pads?

My GPU is a Sapphire RX 5700 XT Nitro+, driver is 20.2.2 (has been like this for multiple versions), Windows 10 (1903), ASUS Prime X370-PRO with Ryzen 5 3600.

My monitor is LG MP59G 27 inch IPS 1080P@75Hz

Here's my issue:

\- Every time I boot up my machine in the morning I see this transparent static effect or fuzzy micro dots on my screen, very obvious under white background (like explorer, or google front page, etc.)

\- I have to change my output from one DP port to the other to stop this effect

\- I have tried switching to HDMI, but the same effect came back next day, so safe to say it is not my DP cable or my monitor's DP input. (I am also using a DP cable certified by VESA)

\- I have a MacBook Pro plugged into my monitor as well via HDMI, and I have not seen this effect when I am using my Mac.

\- Weirder still, I have the same problem with my old gigabyte GTX 1060 before I switched to 5700 XT. But the problem was never this frequent. Now, every time I boot up my system it is almost guarantee to happen.

My assumption is:

\- Electrostatic accumulation inside my PC case?

\- Faulty 8+8 pin power delivery?

\- Bad drivers? (but honestly it looks like a hardware problem)

\- Bad PCIe slot?

\- Monitor's problem?

Lastly, this problem will not show up itself while I am using my PC, it only seems to show up after long period of power off and booting back up.

fnz5j5,barbanegra_ll,"Temps, noise, Power plans and Gaming.","Hi!  I need some advice since im new to Amd and Ryzen. First of all, sorry in advance for my bad english.

I was wondering if changing the power plan in windows may harm performance, or the cpu itself.

I have the 3700X, using the stock cooler, everything is at stock, I had only set the xmp profile so my memories can work at 3000mhz.  So far, performance is really good for gaming. But I find kind of annoying the ammount of noise the fan does, specially when idle. It ramps up quickly, then slows down every few seconds. Temps go from 40s to 50s, even 60s all the time, then back to 40s.

The other thing that I noticed is the really high voltage. I know Ryzen *are supposed* to work at 1.4ish. But those voltages when the pc is idle result in alot of noise in a quiet enviroment.

Setting the power plan to ""Power Saver"" gives me the same result than ""Ryzen balanced"" or ""Ryzen High performance"" when doing tests in Cinebench.  It boost at exactly the same clocks, the only difference is that the voltage when idle goes down to 1v or even 0.9v. So its quietter and much cooler.

So, is it ok if I set Power Saver 24/7 and play games?  Is there any reason not to do it?",11,1585025254,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fnz5j5/temps_noise_power_plans_and_gaming/,Amd,1
fnz434,ButWhole95,Is there any way for me to return an RX 5700 XT that I bought a little over 3 months ago?,"I really did try my best to like this card. When it works, it works amazingly. For older games that hardly utilize the GPU's power, the clock speed is all over the place and the games perform pretty poorly. Destiny 2, for example, is noticeably bad. To get half-decent performance, I have to jack the resolution ratio up to 150% and cap fps at 60. On the other hand, games like Doom and RDR2 perform well.

Anyway, I understand that I bought it awhile ago. But, it is because I really did try to give it a chance. Unforunately, I dont see AMD fixing this issue any time soon. Is there any possible way that I can return this card to the manufacturer? I had originally purchased it off of NewEgg.

I have just built my first AMD PC, based on Ryzen 3950X and ASRock X570M Pro4 mATX motherboard. It runs Linux and I'm experiencing a very strange issue. It's not an issue per se, but I'm not sure it won't impact boost performance in actual workloads, and prevents my ability to take accurate thermal/power measurements in full idle.

The thing is that the CPU tends to boost core 0 (and core 16, its SMT sibling) very high, even when these cores are completely unused or even when the system is fully idle. That is, core 0 and 16 frequency usually floats between 3.5 and 4.5 GHz (and never drops below 3.0 GHz) while the rest of the CPU stays at 2.0-2.2 GHz.

Some s-tui screenshots:

I built my PC today, after frantically ordering parts that were in stock (really hard in GR) in order to have it ready by the time full lock-down took place in my country, so I opted for the XFX RX5600XT THICCBOI 3 Ultra instead of waiting possibly a month for an RX5700 to pair with my R53600 for 1440p gaming.

I was wondering however, whether it would be possible to bypass the 1820mhz limit since some reviewers point out it was artificially set by AMD so that this card wouldn't compete with the RX5700. You obviously can't flash the RX5600XT to an RX5700, but how about another custom bios allowing for +50% (or more?!!) power limit, and clocks above 1820mhz?

Unfortunately, because my GPU is locked, probably from the BIOS, and I don't get Wattman in my Radeon Settings, so the only way to OC it is using [Saphire TRIXX](https://www.overclock.net/forum/70-amd-drivers-overclocking-software/1541958-how-configure-amd-switchable-graphics-overclock-your-amd-radeon-hd-8750m.html), but it still crashes in some games, because this is attempting to override Wattman's settings and the drivers are unhappy with that...  


Could I get a BIOS for any of the Oland cards that use DD3 (instead of GDDR3/GDDR5) and flash it on my card?  How safe is it, considering the access to the GPU and therefore the BIOS chip is quite limited?

How does the Ryzen power plan - balanced &amp; performance relate to how the CPU actually performs? I know 1usmus had made the custom power plan for Ryzen 3k because the Ryzen based power plan did not optimize boost &amp; power limits of the CPU. Is this still the case today and what is the optimal power plan for performance, boost optimization, and power limits/draw?

Also why is my 3600 constantly idling at base clock and above 3.6-4.2 Ghz? It never runs below the base clock even at idle 0%.

As far as core performance boost, PBO (precision boost overdrive), autoOC, &amp; power plan is concerned what is the optimal settings? AMD has made these settings intentionally difficult to correlate what is performing what in relation to the other settings.

I have been trying to find an answer to this question, but I only find posts in forums and on tech sites from last summer 2019 when it was a problem.

I am looking into pairing MSI B450M Bazooka V2 or MSI B450M Mortar Titanium with the Ryzen 5 3600 . I like these because they are mATX and as such a little bit cheaper and more compact.

I can play it safe and take the MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX, but as this one is a normal ATX.

I also looked into X470 boards, but I won't be getting 2 GPU's, so this seems a bit redundant.

If anyone has a suggestion for another board, I would love to hear it!

Having big troubles with the latest chipset driver, after 8 hours it's still on 0%.

Some around the net say the drivers are installed anyway (comparing files versions), but I can't no longer get Ryzen Timing Checker to work (it reports an error on startutp) and it seems to me even Power Saving scheme has been corrupted, as the CPU rarely drops in V like before.

The problem is I can't install a previous versione (it finds the newer installed) and can't uninstall the broken one (it say it doesn't find any unistallable driver).

Is there something like DDU for VGA drivers I can use? Or something else I can try?

fnmo6k,clanaz,"Pls help, total system upgrade after 8 years! Motherboard decisions...","Hi guys,

Currently running and ageing beast of

* Asus Rampage III Extreme
* Xeon X5675 @ 3.8  Ghz
* OCZ DDR3 6x2GB 1700Mhz
* 960 Gtx 2 GB
* 900W Bronze PSU
* 480GB SSD, 2x 500GB HDD

As you can see an upgrade is on the deck. I managed to nab a RX 580 Nitro+ 8GB for under 100eur and while it has improved gaming performance substantially, the CPU is bottlenecking certain games somewhat especially in the low 1% FPS numbers.

At the moment I'm looking to sell the Mobo, CPU, GPU &amp; RAM and switch over to a ryzen system for very little extra cost.

Looking to get a 1600AF (90eur) and overclock it (already have a cooler from the Xeon that will fit AM4) coupled with 2x 8GB 2600Mhz RAM and keeping the other parts.

Now my main issue is what motherboard to use, I'm looking to go as cheap as possible while maintaining out of the box Ryzen 2 compatibility and some decent overclocking performance. Ideally future proof to Ryzen 4 series but that's not a priority. 

Please can you advise me? At the moment this one seems to look decent; MSI B450M-A PRO MAX

Maybe combine it with the 3d stacking (Foveros) for better latency than chiplet design also.

fnhgco,goofysquirrel34,Need some help and advice with GPU / CPU / Monitor Upgrade ?,"I bought a prebuilt PC - i’ll give specs below before getting down to my question...

CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 2300X Processor
RAM: 8GB DDR4
GPU: AMD Radeon RX 570
Storage: 500gb SSD and 1TB HDD 
My monitor: ASUS VG245H 1920x1080 75Hz 1ms

I’m kind of new to PC and pc building and all the parts and components that go with it so please bare with me for some advice and questions. I know everyone recommends building their own, but this one looked like a steal to me at only 400 dollars, and a good entry way to the PC gaming world. There are about 3-4 games I mainly play; World of Warcraft, Overwatch, ESO, Monster Hunter World. 

1. My question and concern is if it’s a good idea to upgrade my monitor to a 144hz monitor. With my CPU and GPU specs, would it capable and strong enough to run the games mentioned above at 144hz? Or will a 144hz monitor be pointless with these specs ? I should also add that I plan on playing these games on High to Ultra settings. Will I need to upgrade my CPU/GPU to a better one to hit these games at max fps (Overwatch, World of Warcraft), I know for games like Overwatch 144hz is a worlds difference. but games like WoW it won’t really matter. I just want some advice and perspective on if I should purchase the 144hz monitor with my specs that i have right now, or if it’d be better to upgrade my specs first then the monitor to experience the full potential of 144hz gaming. I am planning on sticking to 1080p gaming as well. 

2. If you guys do recommend me upgrading parts, CPU/GPU etc. What upgrade would you recommend most that would be compatible with the specs i have on currently ? Thank you again and sorry I am such a noob at this but hoping to learn slowly one day. Money is no issue at the moment, but obviously i would like to get the best bang for my buck so let me know what my options are. 

3. Is liquid cooling a must? Or are fans good enough? Some people swear by it and that it runs silent others say fans are just as fine just but noisier. 

TL;DR - Want to play games at 144hz (mainly overwatch), have 75hz monitor at the moment (SPECS OF CURRENT PC ON TOP) but want to make sure my CPU/GPU is capable of doing so smoothly before purchasing the monitor. Or if i need to upgrade my parts to achieve the true 144hz gaming given the specs i wrote above, which upgrades (CPU/GPU) at a reasonable price would be best to hit 144hz if the specs I have currently are not good enough? Will I also need to purchase new fans or anything else to accommodate new parts if i do need to upgrade? Thank you again for reading.

fngnlz,frozenkuku,ROG Strix X470-F Gaming has popping / crackling audio,"Hello,  


Perhaps this is an issue that has already been out there for a while now, but I really want to resolve this persisting audio problem. So I have an ROG Strix X470-F Gaming mobo with a R7 2700x CPU and 16gb RAM. I have an analog mixer that has L/R Stereo outs joined to a 3.5mm jack into the LINE IN port at the back of the PC. However, when trying to do a test recording on Voice Recorder Windows and even a streaming software like StreamLabs OBS, there is this audio popping / crackling sound especially when you turn up the volume on playback.  


It is not a gain staging problem, as my gain is turned down and I've also had experience dealing with mixers and audio inputs etc. However, when I plug in the same 3.5mm cable into my other PC, it doesn't have that issue.   


Here is an extensive list of troubleshooting solutions that I have already tried around with:

1. Sample rates are standardized across all devices including mixer
2. Audio enhancements all disabled
3. Updated BIOS now at 5406
4. Updated / Reinstalled Drivers (from manufacturer website) Including NVIDIA's latest drivers
5. Tracked down devices causing high DPC / latency when using latencymon (over a period of 8 hours when I'm sleeping leaving the PC on) Now the latency is between 200-400 Microseconds and the summary is that my PC can handle real time audio buffering etc...
6. Tried OC and now I've reset everything to default and left it to auto precision boost
7. CPU Throttling could be an issue but I've set power management to prefer performance on both NVIDIA control panel and the windows power settings
8. As mentioned, it is not a cable or mixer issue since the other PC doesn't have an issue when I plug the LINE in and test record. It's clear and crisp and there are no artifacts / popping / crackling
9. The PC that has the issue is actually newly formatted and there aren't many programs on it. I use it mainly for streaming as I use the other PC for all the other daily stuff. So yes, I haven't tried reformatting it again but I doubt that would solve anything?
10. Could it be some other USB or device causing this issue, I haven't tried unplugging everything beside the power and trying one by one. Perhaps I'll do that now but I'd also like to hear about any other solutions that I've missed...

Basically as you can see, I've done probably everything possible based on what I've searched online but I still have this issue. Of course the audio is not overwhelmed by the popping / crackling, but I do not like it present. Yes, most people probably won't turn up the volume so there's a high chance of it being overlooked, since my game sounds will also be mixed in when I do stream.  


If anyone has this issue and has resolved it, please let me know. Thank you very much!",0,1584952940,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fngnlz/rog_strix_x470f_gaming_has_popping_crackling_audio/,Amd,1

fndwpe,tommy61157,"Upgraded from i7-6700k to Ryzen 7 3700X, a couple of questions","I upgraded from a i7-6700k with a slight OC with 2800MHz RAM (OCed from 2400MHz) to a Ryzen 7 3700X with 3600MHz RAM. Even at all the stock clocks with the stock cooler, this thing is impressive and certainly beats out my last CPU. Windows was very cooperative too since I uninstalled the intel CPU software from before and I put on all the newest drivers and the latest BIOS for my motherboard. Very glad I made the upgrade.

My questions are in regards to Overclocking, should I do it for the 3700X? I hear the way these CPUs are, it's hardly worth it to do it and it just ends up drawing a lot more power and creating a lot more heat for minimal gain. If it is worth it to overclock, what's the best way to overclock my 3700X? Also, my RAM timings aren't the best (18-22-22-42 I believe) What's the best way to go about tightening those to ensure a stable and faster experience? Also, for the CPU, at absolute max load, the CPU goes down to about 3.9GHz and stays right at about 65-66C, that's when I'm 100% pushing it though.  


I have an idea on how to do all that myself, but I want to hear from people here since Ryzen is a very different architecture in terms of how the CPU works, so I want to hear everyone else's thoughts and advice before I try messing with any of that.",0,1584937680,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fndwpe/upgraded_from_i76700k_to_ryzen_7_3700x_a_couple/,Amd,1

I don't mind getting an air cooler for now if it'll save some cash to put towards upgrades later, but will definitely go the AIO route if it can cool better or last longer.

I might start with a 5 3600X and upgrade later so whatever I choose needs to work for both, be it air cooler or AIO. I'd prefer RGB lights but it doesn't matter a whole lot.

So far the three that have caught my eye have been the NZXT Z63 280 mm for ~$235, for the sleek black look and the fact it can display CPU/GPU temps on the screen; and the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280 mm and 120 mm size. I like the extra little fan the Arctic series offers and really like the price. 

Would a 120 mm or 140 mm AIO be enough to properly cool these CPUs? If so I'd use that as the exhaust fan on the rear of the case and call it good.

Why do I have to use vsync to remove screen tearing? Why is my xbox one from 1000 years ago able to run game at 60 fps? Why is this graphics card even being sold if its performance is so lack luster?

fn54zu,Keihass,2700x vs 3600,"I'm planning to build myself a new pc which will be focused on the following tasks in order :  


1 - Music and audio production : I use Ableton live with both sample libraries and synths + plugins

2 - Video editing ; Adobe Premiere and After Effects

3 - Gaming : this is the least important thing regarding high fps rate and overall quality, but wouldn't mind getting some if possible :)

So in my country both the 2700x and the 3600 are priced equally around 180 euros, and the only thing I'd like to base my build is a minimum of 32go of ram for my work with large sample libraries (my current pre-built pc cannot handle more than 16go of ram, which is a big problem for me).

I know that for my music production needs both cpus can be more than enough (especially comparing to my current i5 7400) but which is more valuable : the additional 2 cores, 4 threads in the 2700x or the Zen 2 architecture regarding my video editing work ?

fn14eh,Icybubba,Running into issues with my 5700 XT in games,"So let me try to explain everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Doom is the biggest issue, in OpenGL Doom gets about 80-90 FPS dropping to around 60 FPS frequently, when nothing demanding is on screen it can get above 100 FPS.

In Vulkan it's like there's a hard cap around 75 FPS, it sometimes is able to get slightly above but it runs at a consistent 75 FPS.

Doom is running at Ultra settings at 1080p Vsync is off on all games, I have Freesync so I don't need it, and also my monitor is 144hz.

In Minecraft the FPS fluctuates extremely going from around 144 all the way down to below 60.

In Fallen Order I'm easily able to hit the 144 FPS cap but it has some pretty severe studdering, CPU also has a higher ultilization than the GPU, but I figured that was because Fallen Order is a CPU intensive game. This is at medium settings.

In SW Battlefront II it's performing exactly as expected, once again though the CPU utilization is higher than the GPU one, but it's an FPS.

In Forza Horizon 4, I'm getting above 100 FPS most of the time only dipping down in crowded areas.

In Rise of the Tomb Raider in the benchmark I got an overall score of 143 FPS on high settings with DX12.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what's going on everything seems to be performing about where I'd expect except the first three games. Minecraft is unoptimized though, so take that as you will. But Doom and Fallen Order is weird, Fallen Order performs good, except for the stuttering and I still have no idea why Doom is giving me so many issues.

So I thought Doom its self was the issue, so I reinstalled it especially since the game hangs when I go to low setting back to ultra and doesn't work again until I reinstall. I tried reinstalling the Radeon drivers because I just upgraded from a 580 to the 5700 XT. That had no effect either.

One thing I noticed was that with basically all games the CPU had a higher utilization than the GPU

 [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/25722862](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/25722862)  Here's a user benchmark.

 [https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Icybubb/saved/trnhMp](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Icybubb/saved/trnhMp)  Here's my PCPartPicker for my PC so you know exactly what I'm running.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated. I posted this on a different subreddit got little to no help but I did get some basic questions I know you may ask, and some has already been answered in this post earlier but I'll just go over it again in this section.

""Do you have VSync on?"" No, I don't I have freesync so I don't need it.

""Are you on the newest drivers?"" Yes, Radeon Adrenalin 2020 20.3.1.

""What's your monitor refresh rate? And is it set to that in Windows?"" 144 hz and yes.

I bought my computer 3 days ago, I am trying to improve things.

But when I look at some GPU-Z images, I see that some people are using Vega 8 Graphics Unit with 128-bit bus, while mine is running 64-bit.

I wonder why, is it about single channel and dual channel RAM?

According to my benchmark tests it's doing above than average, but bandwith is low due to bus bandwith.

I have specified my configuration below.

To investigate I tried running Red Dead 2 and getting it to use as much Vram as possible.  With VSR and also in game resolution scaling I was able to get it to use around 14GB of video memory and at this point saw image corruption.  I am not sure if it was because I was using two modes of resolution scaling together though.

I also tried the Superposition benchmark on the 10k Resolution setting which again used around 14GB of VRAM and that seemed to be fine with no corruption or crashes.

Is there a better way I can test?  Something like memtest but for Vram?

I have looked online and the programs I can find either seem to use CUDA or be very old and limited to much smaller amounts of vram.

Recently just got an Asrock 5700xt blower card that is upgraded with the paste + washer mod using Arctic MX-4 Thermal Paste. I noticed after about an hour of gaming on Insurgency: Sandstorm my temps were getting to about 91 Degrees Celsius. I attempted to change that. 

Started with the Auto-Undervolt feature, ran MSI Kombustor 4 x64 at 1440p. 2:30 of GPU at 99% load my temps got right back up to 91 Degrees and never above. Junction temps were 100-105. 

I changed it to manual control and used Advanced Tuning under the fan tab to be slightly a bit more aggressive than stock (adjusted curve here:  [https://imgur.com/a/y0hPJyR](https://imgur.com/a/y0hPJyR)). Ran the same test for 2:30 and never broke 81 Degrees, which is ideal for me.

But with Adrenaline 2020, you cant Auto-Undervolt and manually fan tune. Is there a good reference to teach me how to Undervolt manually so I can still still adjust my fan curve to be a bit more aggressive? Any other advice on getting my temps lower?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

' 

From my own experience using only a single ccx on my 1700x nets me more fps than using 6 real cores. So 4 core and 2 threads is the best performing for me

The comparison uses the 3600, which i do believe suffers from the same issue as the 1700x, provided it only has 3 real cores per ccx. IIRC CSGO is CCX aware, which means it probably treats the 3600 as 3c6t cpu instead, on the same note It will treat 3700x as a 4c8t cpu too.

So basically what you saw in the video is a 3c6t cpu u/4.1ghz vsing a 6c6t cpu u/5ghz'.

fmugmt,-Senku-,Can someone please help me understand how my Ryzen processor (3700X) works?,"As a fair warning, my understanding of how processors work is very limited. I just upgraded from an i7-4790K to the 3700X. I’m used to seeing my i7 at a constant frequency of 4.0GHz, and I figured this was how most CPUs worked—where it’s locked at its base frequency until you decide to overclock it by changing the voltage. Maybe this isn’t how processors work, but needless to say I didn’t do much research into Ryzen as I should before purchasing. I assumed my 3700x would be similar and stay at 3.6GHz until I decided to overclock it. I know I’m probably stupid for this, so please go easy on me. What also worries me is reading comments online about the voltages of this CPU, but obviously I don’t know much about why this is bad or not and is what I mainly need help with.

If it helps, the motherboard I’m using is the ASUS TUF Gaming x570-Plus (WIFI). I updated the bios and downloaded the latest chipset drivers from AMD while setting it to the Ryzen Balanced power setting. 

In the bios it says the voltage is ~1.45V and it seems to fluctuate between 1.4-1.5+V. Some comments I’ve see online said that this is potentially dangerous voltage and could kill your chip? I decided to monitor this while doing different things within Windows. I used Hardware Info 64 to monitor all of this

My system seems to idle at 0.9V and ~3.5 GHz, but this sometimes shows that all the cores will spike to 1.4-1.5V and usually around to 4.2-4.3GHz. The CPU temps also seem to jump from 30C to above 40C. When I monitor the behavior while downloading and installing a game, HWinfo shows that all the cores use around 1.4-1.5V and up to 4.2GHz. HWinfo also shows the same behavior when I also play a game. Why does downloading a game require as much power as playing one (I was also playing FF15 if it matters).

Should I manually set my voltage to something lower, or will my CPU last leaving it with this kind of voltage? Is this mainly the fault of my motherboard? It’s all currently set to auto and I’m not sure how to change it if I should. Ideally I would like this processor to last a while as I want to use this for gaming and streaming.

I'm not sure if my GPU is the problem, it's on a 1000w 80+ gold PSU, with two separate cables and I've even moved them around and swapped them with others. It's paired with a Ryzen 1600, 16GB DDR4, and a B450 Aorus M motherboard, all fully updated including bios. I've heard of driver issues with the newer AMD GPUs so I'm guessing it might be that.

fmr07z,zitping,Doom Eternal - Constant Crashing on 3800X + 5700 XT,"Hey fellow Doom slayers,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having a rough time keeping Doom Eternal from crashing. I'm seeing either a black screen, complete system hang, black cone shaped artifacts shortly before crashing, and a few other flavors of crashes. In cases where I can CTRL-ALT-DEL out of it, it looks like Bethesda Launcher has hung, and in the task bar at the bottom right it looks like Radeon Adrenaline has opened two to three more times. I'll need to manually end the Bethesda and Doom processes to get back to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

I've completely wiped Windows, then after more crashes I used DDU in Safe Mode and removed drivers, then shut down, then wiped windows 10 again to a fresh install, then installed the chipset drivers, mobo drivers, all windows updates, then installed the recommended version of AMD's GPU driver with the factory reset option, then installed Bethesda Launcher and Doom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was just able to play for the entire first level before it crashed on me. Gameplay time can last anywhere from 5 minutes to over an hour before it'll work properly.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried manually ending the processes for all AMD software and launching Doom straight from the .exe without opening Bethesda launcher, and the game will have the same behavior. I've also tried running on only ""High"" settings in-game as recommended in their FAQ and no change. This happens in either Battlemode or Single player, happens in Fullscreen and Bordered. Same behavior also for the 20.2.1 drivers, except then DOOM yells at me about out of date drivers

&amp;#x200B;

Bethesda support has unfortunately just been copy/pasting their FAQ for PC crashing without actually replying to my ticket. I'm just looking for ANYTHING to try to get it to work for more than 30 minutes at a time, the game is unplayable for me at the moment. Thanks in advanced for any troubleshooting ideas. I'm really willing to try whatever.

I tried Red Dead Redemption also using VSR and also in game resolution scaling to maximise Vram usage and saw on screen corruption.  I am not sure if this is because there is a problem or because I was using two resolution scaling solutions at once.

I also tried Superposition benchmark at 10k resolution which seemed to be using around 14GB of vram and worked fine so I am really not sure now!

fmnbui,Hixxae,Dangerously high memory temperatures on 5700XT + Accelero Xtreme IV,"Hi folks, I have a 5700XT Challenger, that one from Asrock with the poor cooler. I bought it with the idea to put on my old IV.

At first results were very underwhelming, with hotspot reaching 110°C with a mild OC. I managed to get this MUCH cooler by removing the washers, now it stays nicely below 100°C.

I am however running into a big issue with memory temperatures. At first, with just the backplate ""properly"" installed the memory temperatures would slowly climb to + 100°C, NOT OK. After buying some heatsinks with double sided tape the temperature typically does not go above 96°C (after quite some time) and mild fan speeds (&lt;1500 RPM). Not an issue with airflow, removing the side panel doesn't do much to reduce temperatures (near identical, actually).

I'm wondering if perhaps there's something I'm doing wrong? I checked some posts and these saw very reasonable temperatures...

I'll reboot and add some pictures after taking the card out.",17,1584826791,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fmnbui/dangerously_high_memory_temperatures_on_5700xt/,Amd,1

Recently I noticed that GTX 1070 (which I have in another build) shows more performance in gaming so I tested bith cards in my build (AC Odyssey's benchmark results at high (not even very high) settings in Full HD are 66 FPS for 1070 and 58 for 5600XT, Heaven benchmark for [1070](https://ibb.co/GJ39T9J) and for  [5600xt](https://ibb.co/kKyb3rd)). All the tests and benchmarks in the Internet shows that 5600XT easily outperforms 1070. What's wrong with my 5600 XT?
P.S. I tried to OC 5600XT just like in the LinusTech's video but all I got are crashes and restart of PC.

fmhwz2,Straight-Outta-AA,3600 not running at correct speeds and high idle tmps,"Hello,

Yesterday I just switched from an i5-9600k to a new mobo (MSI x570 MPG gaming plus) and the Ryzen 5 3600. 

To test the cpu I used prime95, cpu-z for speeds, and core temp for temps.

I am also running the ryzen balanced plan and the BIOS is set to default, except the RAM speed is set to 3200mhz (It for some reason defaulted to 2133 mhz)

I noticed that on Idle, my cpu is running at 40 at lowest but jumps up a lot randomly to the 50s and I don't know how to get it to lower stable temps. Also while testing, I noted that the CPU ran at about 4075.05 mhz under 100% load and the temps were at about 73 and idled at about 3524 mhz at 40 degrees with the jumping of course. 

Any help to get my cpu to run to its full 4.2 ghz potential and to get lower idle temps would be appreciated. Also I haven't ran very long stress tests and will start one soon and post the max temp in the comments.",0,1584809253,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fmhwz2/3600_not_running_at_correct_speeds_and_high_idle/,Amd,1

fmhdns,Jeb_x,Compatibility question: MSI X570-A Pro + Wi-Fi 6 AX200 = working?,"I  was thinking about getting the MSI B450 Pro Carbon AC since it has  wireless lan already integrated and seems to be a decent motherboard  overall. After doing some reading today I changed my mind since the Pro  Carbon doesn't seem to work with the Ryzen 3x00 very well and/or the  BIOS is constrained to some extent when using the new Ryzen CPUs.

So  after all I want to get a X570 mainboard just to be sure and minimize  problems. But the wi-fi ones are too expensive for me and I desperately  need wireless internet!

So my question is this:

Can I install the Intel  Wi-Fi 6 AX200 on the MSI X570-A PRO?

Specifications of the Intel card: M.2 2230, M.2 1216;  A-E-Key

fmh7xp,StevenH27,AMD Ryzen 5 3600 - WFH Power House appreciation thread,"So considering recent events with the COVID-19 outbreak my team got sent home, and not to relax, but to work from home.

I was given the choice to choose between some fancy Dell laptop with an octa core i7 and 16GB or use my personal PC instead, a recent build that I did for myself right after Ryzen 3000 hit the shelves.

It isn't anything special, a Ryzen 5 3600, 16GB of 3600MHz CL17 DDR4 memory, a 1TB Intel 660 NVMe drive for Windows 10 and VMs and an older Gigabyte GTX1060 6GB that's starting to show it's age in more recent titles.

I've heard several complaints from colleagues that went with the laptop option and I cannot say the same with my build. It just flies whatever I throw at it. Running 2 ubuntu VMs, 10+ browser windows with Grafana, Kibana, Zabbix that constantly update at least twice every 30 seconds + an Amazon WorkSpace environment + several tabs open in Firefox for personal stuff like Youtube, Reddit and Facebook and this beast barely breaks a sweat. 

I was hesitant at first when it came to upgrading my trusty 3570K, but man, how grateful am I right now for making the right decision when Ryzen 3000 launched. 

Also having three 1080p monitors at my disposal just makes this social distancing phase just a little better. I can post pics for anyone interested in temporary wfh setup.",4,1584806661,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fmh7xp/amd_ryzen_5_3600_wfh_power_house_appreciation/,Amd,1

When Warzone first came out I was on the January 19th drivers (sorry not at home so don’t know version) and I would freeze when jumping out of the plane for 2-5 seconds. This is not a performance problem since I average 110 frames on max settings and it also happens on the lowest settings.

So I decided to update drivers and I started with the latest recommended. No freeze on initial jump from the plane. However, I started getting 1 second freezes sporadically through matches. I then used the latest optional drivers, same deal.

I am now back on the January version drivers until this is fixed. At least I hope it’s fixed. Just wanted to share my findings in case anyone else is puzzled by stuttering issues with their AMD card.",8,1584804318,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fmgly4/cod_warzone_drivers_stutter_fix/,Amd,1

i have a Sapphire RX 590 Nitro+ SE.
In the last few weeks i had a very strange issue. Normaly the card has a target temperatue of 75° degree celsius, which was fine because the fans were not noticable. But now the fans ramp up to 2000-2400 rpm if this temp is reached (or even before) and cools down to 55-65° and hold this temperatue. Of course this is very noisy and inefficient. I have tested this in all of my games, but in Battlefield 5 this happens even in the main menue. In Call of Duty Warzone i have to stop after 10 minutes because the fans sound like a jet starting. If the game is closed the temperature is at 50° imediatly, but the fans are still at over 2000 rpm for a 1-2 minutes.

Here a Screenshot after closing Battlefield https://i.imgur.com/AASZ7C4.png

I have tried:
*) Fresh install of Windows + newest amd driver
*) Cleaned the whole case
*) Tried silent BIOS of GPU (system shuts down after 5-10 minutes)
*) Tried older Driver (same issue)
*) Used AMD Wattman (card gets hot and the fans ramp up and down)

System:
R5 2600
MSI B450 Pro VDH

fmdj8s,belialwave,Desperately looking for help with 20.3.1 drivers,"Hiya all,

I did a factory reset (clean install) of the latest version of drivers 20.3.1 for my RX Vega card since that's what Doom Eternal asked of me. Still, it crashes without any error message, but the bigger problem here is that these new drivers basically broke a lot of other games for me.

For example, GTA V now displays ""Unable to start the game. Please verify your game data"" message (Steam verification doesn't do anything). Risk of Rain 2 and Bio Inc. Redemption both start, but there's no screen, only audio playing! I don't see any graphics, although if I click my mouse, I recognize I'm clicking in the menu, yet I don't see the game.

ALT+TAB has been broken in these games as well. 

What I did try:

\- resetting PC and games  
\- separate possible solutions for every game  
\- running games via Radeon software  
\- disabling Steam and Discord overlays  
\- adding game files to antivirus exceptions  
\- running .exe files as administrator  
\- verifying game data

I am running Intel I5, 16 GB RAM, AMD RX Vega and Win 10. No other graphical issues have been detected in streaming, using browsers and running any kind of video editing.

All suggestions are more than welcomed! Thanks and stay safe! #washyourhands",0,1584789734,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fmdj8s/desperately_looking_for_help_with_2031_drivers/,Amd,1

Only after flashing, I decided to look through the details on each file and seen that there is a difference in Target Temperature and Fan Acoustic Target on pretty much each file.

The one I flashed has a Target Temperature of 75c and Acoustic Target of 2000 RPM.

I am wondering if I should have flashed the 90c target temperature instead since I don't want to be thermal throttled at 75c which it hits very easily.

fmcv2e,Eheheh93,You're my last hope.,"So, im gonna try to cut it short: I have r9 285 compact 2gb version from Sapphire. I've been stuck with 17.7.x drivers for a very long time because no matter what i do/change as soon as update to 18.x.x or new (even the 19.x.x) i get random ""horizontal line flickering"" for not even half second every once in a awhile in any game (not Windows or programs, just games) and the only ways to fix this issue are 4: 

  
**1) Keep using the 17.7.x drivers that work amazing (but isn't ideal as new games get released);**  
**2) Using vsync (not ideal for cs:go);**   
**3) Using Anti-Aliasing which again if im trying to push high framerate isn't ideal because my gpu is not that powerful;**   
**4) Play in windowed mode but that adds input lag.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i've been trying every new driver with no luck. Yes i always do a clean install with DDU and the AMD clean up utility thinghy and no luck.

I've heard that wattman could be the issue but i dunno what to change in it so i never touched it. I don't think it's gpu related just because with older drivers everything works just fine. I run the default clocks so it's no an OC issue either. You guys are my last hope. Maybe some of you have a solution or someone from AMD who works on drivers can help me out.

*WHO advice for public:*

[https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Most people who become infected experience mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others. Take care of your health and protect others by doing the following:

&amp;#x200B;

*Wash your hands frequently*

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

&amp;#x200B;

*Maintain social distancing*

Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

&amp;#x200B;

*Stay at home!*

If not necessary do not go out!

&amp;#x200B;

*Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth*

Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

&amp;#x200B;

*Practice respiratory hygiene*

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.

Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

&amp;#x200B;

*If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early*

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

&amp;#x200B;

*Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider*

Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.",56,1584780449,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fmc2a4/well_done_guys_and_girls_lots_of_people_joined_to/,Amd,1

I am currently testing various of tools to stream from my PC to the FireTV Stick 4k.

As it seems the only controller it accepts is the device connected to the FTV. I have a XBOX 360 controller connected to my PC and would want to use that to play via AMD Link as I don't own a gamepad to connect with the FTV.

Hello guys so I just built a new HTPC/NAS system and it’s giving me a lot of trouble. First off the CPU itself runs hot about 40C idle when the computer isn’t doing anything. Another big issue I have is the GPU keeps spiking to 100% usage and then back to 0% usage. Also when I move my mouse around the GPU usage spikes and my mouse movement stutters and lags. Also sometimes the GPU stays at 100% of extended periods of time. This is my first AMD machine since my Barton 3200+ and I’m kind of disappointed. Is it possible that I might have some sort of Malware? My intuition is telling me it’s this damn Gigabyte motherboard though. I’ve always bought ASUS since my nForce.

fm8ion,BrainMuncher,20.3.1 Freesync not working in multiple games,"Downgraded to 20.3.1 from 19.12.1 and immediately noticed stuttering in games. I soon realised that freesync was no longer working properly in some games, where it had been working perfectly with the older drivers. It looks like it's trying to work but failing. The refresh rate of my monitor does not stay at 144Hz like you would expect with freesync off, it bounces between 72, 144, and sometimes 96Hz. The result is a very jittery screen, not smooth at all.

At first I thought it was only happening in dx9 games, but it doesn't happen in all dx9 games, and it also happens in Far Cry 3 dx11.

The fix seems to be to tick ""disable fullscreen optimizations"" in windows compatibility settings for the game exe. However this was not necessary with the old driver.

Doing this also seems to cause problems. When I ran Risen with ""fullscreen optimizations"" disabled, freesync worked again but attempting to open the radeon overlay caused an instant bluescreen, IRQL not less or equal.

Flatout 2 won't run at all with ""fullscreen optimizations"" disabled and RIS enabled. ""Cannot open display mode"".",3,1584760995,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fm8ion/2031_freesync_not_working_in_multiple_games/,Amd,1

Since I find this quite distracting, I've thought of maybe using another display. But since all my other good displays are some NEC CRT ones, I can't directly use the output of my V56.

fm6yge,VSmoL,My experience with Gigabyte Gaming and PowerColor Red Devil 5700XT,"Hi, I am telling story about my experience with these two cards and also why I have these two cards.

So last weekend my local store had good deal on Gigabyte Gaming 5700XT card, which I bought immediatly because I wanted to join on red team especially when I heard their drivers are fine (mostly) now. I did fresh windows install and everything I heard about, plugging 2 different power cables to the card etc. etc. Well, now I have one week of experience with Gigabyte Gaming card and I've only encountered twice some weird problems with this card. Both issues were the same where it just ""lose"" my main monitor and instantly goes back to it. Not big of a deal because this only happened when I was playing with my Playstation 4 on my main screen, I know that it lost my main screen because web browser windows had changed to other monitors. Well, overall I am really happy about this.

Well, now the other story about my PC Red devil 5700XT card. This is a little bit a messy experience. First of all, this same local store had this card on sale and I thought that I just return my Gigabyte card and get this Red Devil card because of its extra feature and it was only couple euros more so why not. Well, I replaced my Gigabyte card with Red Devil card and I did not reinstalled windows nor drivers, just replaced the card. Then I started to play Apex Legends with really good fps and everything was just fine, good fps, good temps but suddenly it throw my 3 displays totally vomit + slug combo and I had no way to tell what was happening on the screen. (Too bad I didn't took picture of it). Still my computer was working because I was able to hear my friend on discord and talk with him and everything, but screens were just messy so I had to restart. After the restart I played another match of Apex Legends and everything went fine. Althought, for my experience, if computer does something odd, there is high chance it does it again so I thought that its weekend and I have free time so just in case I reinstall my windows and start on a fresh table with this Red Devil card. My windows install went just fine, no problems, been installing windows like 5 times now in this year already so I know how to drill.  BUT now comes the weird part. First thing what I did was that I downloaded AMD Adrenalin (Radeon software) from red devils site to install my drivers, but on that point where it should ""find"" or ""recognize"" other displays, computer just reboots itself and cannot anymore boot to the windows. So I just thought that maybe it was because I downloaded them from  PowerColors site. So new fresh windows install again 10 minutes fast foward to downloading drivers again from AMDs site, installing and at the same point where it should recognize displays it reboots again and cant get to the windows anymore. Also a big note that I have glass panel and noticed when reinstalled my windows that only one of the fans were spinning on this PC Red Devil card, but I didn't check it when I played Apex Legends so I thought it is just because there are no drivers yet. 

So my question here is that what I did wrong with this PC Red Devil card? Gigabytes card was just plug and play with fresh windows install and it worked, but excatly same setup with Red devil card and I can't even install drivers. Below is my main setup which I have.

I might RMA this PowerColor card and just keep my Gigabytes and be fine with this.

There's not a lot of information out there just yet (last flury was around December 2019) but I thought I would gather what we know so far, and see if anyone else had something to add.

So here's what we know so far (and sources):

x670 chipset

* AM4 Socket
* USB4 may be implemented
* Thunderbolt 3 support - probably not implemented.
*  ""enhanced"" PCIe 4.0 (not sure what ""enhanced"" means)
* Increase I/O:  more M.2, SATA and USB 3.2 ports.

Ryzen 4xxx

* Up to 16 cores,  7nm+ 
* New core design
* \~17% (or more) increase in IPC
* Larger cache size and bandwidth
* Slight boost in clock speeds (100-200mhz)
* Better yields (i.e. keep prices low.  Maybe better silicon lottery?.  About 10% better efficiency and more densely packed transistors)(EUV technology )
* 8 core CCX, instead of 4 core CCX (my understanding is it means less duplicate data handling)

This rumour has me sad, as it suggests March 2021 is now the time line were CPU's would be available to us.  If that's credible, I will probably just upgrade to Zen 2 now as I don't need the expanded I/O options, and hope the X570 fully supports the 4xxx CPU's (currently on an i5-4670k)

First, the stock cpu fan. It is HORRIBLE. No I am not talking about loudness, that is good, but the fact that it is speeding up and slowing down CONSTANTLY. I move the mouse, and it starts blowing harder. I tried to change the intervals in the bios, I put them all on very low, and 70% on 70 degrees, and now it is too silent, getting 65 degrees idle! DC, PWM, silent profile, nothing else works.

I also noticed that while idling in Windows, the cpu speed is constantly 4 ghz or higher. CPU usage is 0% to 1%, but I have never seen the speed drop below 4 ghz. 

So I thought, maybe installing the latest chipset driver will help? But I can't! It is stuck on 0%. i tried the solutions from reddit (Delete AMD folder, run the executables from that folder, downgrade then try again etc etc). Even a clean install won't help. They refuse to install. 

Is there anything else I can try before I start the hassle of returning everything during this corona crisis?",0,1584746277,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fm4xb0/ryzen_3700x_nothing_but_problems_and_issues/,Amd,1

I've also played on crappy hand me downs that need to be played at the lowest settings possible, and even often at lower resolutions just to get the game to run decently.  


Now that I am gaming for real, I don't know much about the settings in the AMD Adrenaline software.  


Right now I am playing Doom Eternal, but I play a lot of Halo, Rocket League and other competitive games. Great graphics are nice, but I want to mainly ensure smooth gameplay first, or least a good mix of lower input lag with awful tearing, ghosting etc.  


What settings do you recommended I try, and what setting should I leave alone? Also, do the settings in the Adrenaline panel override the settings in-game? I'm not sure how that works.

fm3690,DerKrieger105,Doom Eternal Performance issues (Potential CPU Bottleneck on 3800X?),"Hey everyone I am hoping to find some answers as to why Doom Eternal is running so poorly for me.

I installed it last night I began playing today and noticed some issued right away.   


It appears my CPU is bottlenecking my 1080 pretty hard. I noticed performance that was a bit lower than what I would expect. Changing graphical settings from low to ultra did little to change FPS. My GPU usage was low. On average about 75% peaking at about 80%. CPU usage seemed even across all cores and sat at about 25%.  Opening up Doom's in game stats showed my CPU frame times far behind my GPU and outside in the first area looking at the city vista FPS plummeted to sub 60FPS with CPU frame times in the red. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea what could be causing this? I haven't noticed any problems in other games and comparing things like Cinebench scores mine are a bit lower but not anything beyond variance when you take account of a used Windows install and background applications. 

&amp;#x200B;

It isn't temperatures. The CPU is under a Kraken X62 and never reports above 65C. It is boosting fine to 4.35Ghz.  GPU is watercooled and is under 60C and hitting full boost of 2000Mhz.

fm2yw8,Caaros,No idea what to upgrade my graphics card to,"I'm not sure if this is the correct sub for this, but I the only one that seemed to fit the bill more has been seemingly dead for six months, so I'm here now.

It's been several years since I built this PC, and to be fair I was a child back then and didn't even pick out the parts, but I think that it's well over time that I upgrade my GPU, since I have been experiencing increasing difficulty running new games over the past few years.

Problem is, I have not the slightest clue what GPU to upgrade to, considering that there are seemingly hundreds of options scattered all over creation. I'm also not sure what the best practices for upgrading a GPU are, and I've heard plenty of horror stories in the past of people upgrading their graphics card and Windows suddenly throwing a fit about licenses or something, although I don't know the specifics of that either.

Presently, according to CPU-Z, I have an AMD Radeon R7 200 series GPU. In the past when I've told people that's what I have, I've had several occasions where people act like that graphics card doesn't even exist, so there's a possibility I may have the wrong information. I can provide more information on my computer if necessary.

fm2yj7,lmxwt,Most future proof CPU for a new build?,"Basically I want to build my first PC but In worried about it being somewhat obsolete because of the new consoles. I don’t want to have to spend loads for it to be matched by the Xbox because that kind of defeats the purpose of getting into PC gaming for me. 

I’m trying to put a list of components together and I can’t decide if it’s best to build high end ish now, or build a lower spec and upgrade down the line. If I do the later I was wondering if the motherboard Im looking at, or just any motherboard, would be compatible with future Ryzen CPUs? Or should I just get a really good Ryzen CPU now in a better build, if so what would be future proof while also cost effective? Or do CPUs just generally last a long time in terms of their ability to provide high performance and it shouldn’t be something to be worried about?

Sorry if this is a noob question I’m new to PC building so I’m still trying to understand it all.

fm02rz,TetisTiger,[HELP] XMP not working after using Ryzen Master,"My ram kit advertises as 3200 15-17-17-35, but xmp only sets it to 3200 16-18-18-36.

I then looked around and found Ryzen Master, which then I used and could set cas latency to 15 and disabled gear down mode.

Although, after trying to lower tRAS, I got some bluescreens and the system wouldn't boot.

So I then just rested the BIOS and everything was ok, but xmp was disabled.

I then didn't set any profiles on ryzen master (it didn't even start automatically) which then I decided to completely uninstall.

Restarted my PC, enabled XMP and all I get now is BSODs. The xmp profile is at 3200 16-18-18-36 at 1.35V (default profile I always used before trying ryzen master), and it gives me BSODs such as 'Page Fault In Nonpaged Area' and 'SYSTEM IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL'.

I'm using a r5 3600X on a aorus Elite b450 board at the latest bios (p51).

Any fix for this? Can't boot with XMP turned on anymore.

flz96a,Brokkensteel,Problems with new Ryzen 7 3700x build. need some help,"hey guys.

here i am again this time with some problems with my new (and first) ryzen build.

**specs:**

\-Ryzen 7 3700X w/ wraith prism (fan set to **H** for extra fan speed?)

\-Asus ROG Strix X470-F Gaming

\-G. Skill trident Z NEO 3600MHz CL16

**Things that stayed**

\-Corsair RM750

\-G1 gaming GTX970

\-samsung 850 evo 250gb

\-WD blue 1TB

\-Some case fans

So, i assembled everything, fresh windows and everything was running, so i started to look at the next details.

**1st**\- enabling the rams at the xmp speed. 3600 cl16 g.skill trident Z NEO. 

System wont correctly boot, it lags and takes a long time to boot, then as soon as the start windows screen appears it just shuts down and restarts and i see the EZ debug light for RAMS turn on.

if i shut  down and switch to default ram speed everything just works perfectly fine

Any ideas?

**2nd-** temperatures make absolutely no sense at all!!! 

after installing HWmonitor and checkinh things i see the cpu max clocks hover around 4.2/4.3Ghz, so i guess that is around normal right?

but the CPU temperatures is like a rollercoster,with just HW open and doing nothing peaks at 40º then starts to drop 1 degree at a time until it reaches like 29/30/31º then jumps again to anywhere between 40º and 50º, then same thing, one degree at a time in perfect intervals of time until it does exactly the same.

also, any ideas on this? im really lost as i have been on team blue since like forever

flz18n,Amricke,3800x Vcore too High??,"Looking for help with my first AMD build. Specs are;

CPU: 3800x

Motherboard: Asus B450-F Gaming

Ram : G Skill 3600Mhz

GPU: GTX 1080 SC

Cooler: Currently Wraith until my x63 AM4 Bracket comes in

DOCP enabled to reach 3600Mhz on RAM

Ryzen Balanced Power Plan with 10% minimum CPU

[https://imgur.com/a/EmmZHYd](https://imgur.com/a/EmmZHYd)

I have probably seen every video on the 3700x and 3800x in relation to voltage, oc, general setup. Reddit posts generally recommend not OC'ing these CPU's and allowing PBO to do it's thing as overclocking limits the max single core. I am completely fine with this and have no intentions of overclocking. However, after installation and completing the BIOS update I have noticed Vcore sits relatively high stock ( 1.38-1.41 average ). I attempted within my BIOS to manually adjust Vcore to 1.325 but it will not stay applied. On Windows reboot I am back to the same Vcore. The only way I have been able to get the Vcore to stick is using Ryzen Master Manual Overclock, but that requires a core frequency change. I simply just want to keep stock settings with lower voltage to increase the lifespan of this CPU. Playing the latest COD Warzone my CPU sits at 1.39 the entire time., League of Legends sits around 1.42.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also noticed none of my cores ever sleep while Ryzen Master is open. I read somewhere this is due to the application constantly keeping them awake for a status, but I have seen people post images with cores sleeping. Something just does not feel right with this CPU or the Motherboard auto settings. I rarely see Vcore under 1v which it should while idle. My Wraith cooler constantly ramps up and down every 10 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone shed some light on my issue? Is this just normal Vcore jumps for a 3800x and I am worried for nothing? If i have to apply a 4300 all core oc with 1.325 to solve this I guess I will lose the single core boost.

I’ve downloaded the latest 20.3.1 Adrenaline software after using DDU to uninstall the previous drivers. I’ve uninstalled the previous chipset drivers to install the new AMD Chipset Drivers, Revision numbed 2.03.12.0657.
I’ve selected factory reset for the Adrenaline driver download in hopes of that working. I have disabled enhanced sync, during the miracle that I was able to open the AMD Radeon software for 10 seconds. 

I’m at a loss for words with how ridiculous this driver support experience has been. I built my PC over 2 week ago and told myself I would wait for the next driver update in hopes that would fix the issue for me, but it didn’t. I’ve had this PC built for 2 weeks and haven’t been able to use the computer without just removing all AMD drivers and using the default windows ones.

I guess my question boils down to how long is the typical wait in between AMD card releases? Since the 5600xt came out this year am I waiting a full year for a comparable RDNA2 card? Or less?

flv1fl,iNeedsSomeHelp,Lapping Zen2 and/or Stock Temps [r5 3600],"I'm trying to get a feel for what normal end users are seeing temperature wise on their chips because I'm seeing so much variation online and its generally just a ""can i do better"" nagging feeling.  I have left all voltages, clocks, modifiers, PTT limits as stock. Room temps held at a 20-22c margin via single room AC unit.

We wont talk about the stock cooler - Its loud, it was perfectly fine parking at 3.6ghz around 93c stock paste and mx4. Its a non-starter for this comparison.

With a noctua u9s, in Push pull 6threads loaded with ROSETTA pushes the CPU into the middle 70s.  
All Core p95 Small FFTs instantly drops clocks to around 3800mhz, with CPU temps hitting the low 80's. This is with CPU fans at 80% &gt; moving to 100% does not make a difference in temps or CLOCKS, just increases noise and airspill around the fan shroud. Converting a Blue Ray Movie to h.264 Loaded all core will see temps higher than p95 (around 85-87, just before it drops to base clock)

With a Scythe Mugen 5 Rev -b I'm Only seeing a minor temperature change over before. All other things held Constant. there's no temperature differential on this cooler between 100% fan speed, and 50% fan speed - nor does adding some Shadow wings fans in Push/Pull change it. 6 threads loaded with ROSETTA  sees it between 64-67c. p95 all core small FFTs instantly drops clocks again to around 3800 and parks the temps on 79C steady.

Idle temps are also really odd : they bounce anywhere from 30c to 50c usually with a quick spike up, then a slow fall down to 30C, then a spike again, rinse repeat. I had to set the hysteresis for CPU fan speed to 1 second to prevent the fan from just ramping up/down all the time when running the u9s. I eventually just settled on a 50% steady state fan speed base for the u9s and the mugen 5.

The heat-pipes do not seem to really be even warm at the caps or baseplate, Nor do the finstacks. It really acts like its limited at the silicon/IHS/Cooler interface.

  
I'm coming from and older time, so I'm not sure if past experiences really apply. Lapping my fx8350 revealed it to be not even a bowl, but a giant crater. Lapping it to a mirror Finish dropped load temps by almost 15 degrees C never really seeing above 55-60C (and yes Know this is implied temps from a voltage and power curve, as there is no thermal diode on the FX) even fully loaded, and allowed me to run 4.8ghz on 1.322volts. My VRM would push up into the high 80's here and why I never went further. Pics linked = &gt; [https://imgur.com/a/RBx7YjQ](https://imgur.com/a/RBx7YjQ)

*I am not sure if this is a real difference in temps, if temps are being measured differently and that causes the change and its all just a perception. Or if the new chiplet being such a small area under the IHS contributes to a higher silicon temp. Or if the IHS itself is just a giant bowl.* ***I really don't know.***

fltqyi,rmi_,Random short system freezes with high DRAM-Frequency,"Hi,

I just tinkered with my FCLK and DRAM, and got both to work on 1900Mhz (3800MT/s). Memtest works fine (tested for a few hours to 400%), but Windows randomly freezes (even the cursor) for a few seconds and then continues to work normally (no crashes). 

Changing DRAM-Freq back to 1800Mhz (everything else, including FCLK and voltages, the same) stops the freezing. SO it seems to be a RAM problem. I tried highering/lowering DRAM-voltage, with no effect. 

Any ideas what could be causing this?

So I sent a message to AMD, with an invoice for the item showing I had purchased it from Amazon, one of the eligible retailers according to AMDs own website. I got a reply saying that I should have checked with Amazon before placing the order.

So AMDs website states that Amazon is retailer running this promotion, but it is down to the consumer to double check with Amazon before placing an order. Absolute false advertising.

* Specs
* OS +Version
* Chipset Driver (AMD/Manufacturer) 

I'm more interested in **5500 XT** as well, since I'm looking to buy one.

Thanks a lot for the tremendous support on my previous [1st Gen Ryzen RAM speed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fie3iw/owners_of_1st_gen_ryzen_cpus_using_xmp_is_it/) &amp; [stable speed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fie3iw/owners_of_1st_gen_ryzen_cpus_using_xmp_is_it/). These two posts will be the proof that 1st Gen still kicks-ass.

Also, a tip from some of my friends (well 2 of them) who are using 5700XT : 

&gt;**TLDR : BIOS Update (if needed) &gt; Clean OS install (let it update) &gt; AMD Chipset Drivers for MB &gt; 2020 GPU Drivers.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**Install Chipset Drivers for your Motherboard from AMD**, manufacturer chipsets drivers are mostly out-dated, are not optimized in certain cases and recent AMD chipset drivers are great (A clean install of OS is recommended before you install it) then install the the new GPU drivers.   
&gt;  
&gt;Results : We play Monster Hunter World together and 50% of the time at least one of them would crash or stutter (if we play over 3-4hrs) . Last two days we (technically for 40 hrs) we have been playing together without a single issue for more than 4 hrs. (on both CoD Warzone + MHW).

I suggest you guys to try this as well if you guys want.

flln3w,nitro001,Workstation w/IPMI Board for Ryzen 3900X processor?,"Hello,

I am looking to FINALLY upgrade my long-aging AMD Athlon X4 personal desktop and also my intermediate AMD FX-9590 VMWare Server.

I want a powerful workstation motherboard with IPMI that I utilize Hyper-V or VMWare for VMs but still host a higher-end GPU for Gaming.

There are only 2 real boards, both ASRock Rack, I see with true IPMI: A X570 board, the X570D4I-2T, it is miniITX and only has 1 PCIex16 slot up to 64GB RAM (not released yet); or an X470 series X470D4U or X470D4U2-2T microATX up to 128GB RAM.  There is one other I see, the ASUS Pro WS X570-ACE but it doesn't have true IPMI management.

And if your asking why I am hung-up on IPMI, running VMWare under the old FX-9590 without IPMI didn't give proper temperature sensors and it would every once in a while overheat, want to avoid any possible situation like this and be able to read the sensors properly from the hypervisor.

So what it comes down to is really X570 (1 PCIe 4.0 x16) vs X470 (2 PCIe 3.0 x16, 1 PCIe 3.0 x4) or another capable X470 or x570 board I am missing to do this.

I'm wondering if you can help here.

I'm trying to build a Cad/Render workstation (mainly Autocad, Archicad, SketchUp and photographic software like Capture One) and I'm wondering if the following configuration is balanced.

I already asked in other subs and the suggestion was to pair the Ryzen 7 with a GTX2070. I'd prefer to have an AMD GPU because I'm an Apple user, and if I won't manage to fully switch to Windows 10, I'll probably convert this build too a ryzentosh or Linux and Amd GPUs looks well supported.

I choose the AMD RX5700XT just because is supported and looking at the benchmark is really close to the RTX2070.

I'm an occasional gamer, not a heavy user. With my kids we play sometimes fortnite and other games, but this is not the primary goal of the build, and I'd prefer to have a GPU that can be used for professional work. 
I'm seeing that on the AMD website there are other GPU like the WX series, but I'm not able to understand which is more appropriate.

For the MoBo I choose the X570 for future updates and for the bt/wifi. I choose the mini itx because still have some indecision on the case. I'd like to build a sff pc, but probably the mATX case I choose it will be an easy build for my first pc after 20 years :)

Is the 3700X cooler a good one? I'm wondering if I can save money on the noctua. I really like the idea to have a quiet build, and I choose the noctua for this reason and also because I'd like to build a sort of all black pc. But is something that I can update later.

Thanks for any help!

flj9ui,Cyber_Strength,Lower FPS with Vulkan on a GSN 1.0 card,"I have a laptop with a GCN 1.0 dGPU a I run the latest drivers, usually they are ok and bring more performance than the 17.X drivers HP is recommending. In the last year or so Vulkan support was brought to GCN. There was a lot of media coverage and speculation how it should increase the performance of the cards, so when I tried with games like No Man's Sky, DOOM and War Thunder (experimental Vulkan version), I get lower fps, not drastically, but enough to make it unplayable at times.  


What has your experience with GCN card on Vulkan been? I've never heard of anyone getting lower performance, could it be because my GPU is a small laptop die?  Or am I missing something?",5,1584656991,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/flj9ui/lower_fps_with_vulkan_on_a_gsn_10_card/,Amd,1

fla9q2,cuco_,Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.3.1 Released," **Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.3.1 Highlights**

## Support For

* DOOM™ Eternal
   * Achieve up to 5% better performance playing Doom Eternal (Ultra Nightmare settings) at 1920x1080p on the Radeon™ RX 5700XT with Radeon™ Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.3.1, versus Radeon™ Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.2.2. RS-333
* Half-Life™: Alyx
* Ghost Recon™ Breakpoint
   * Vulkan® API

## Added Vulkan® Support

* VK\_EXT\_post\_depth\_coverage
   * This extension indicates support for shader modules that use the SPV\_KHR\_post\_depth\_coverage extension. Fragment shaders using the SPV extension can control whether the SampleMask built-in input variable reflects the coverage after the depth and stencil tests are applied. This extension is only supported on AMD RDNA hardware.
* VK\_KHR\_shader\_non\_semantic\_info
   * This extension indicates support for shader modules that use the SPV\_KHR\_non\_semantic\_info extension. Shader modules using the SPV extension can include non-semantic instructions that can be safely removed from the module.
* VK\_EXT\_texel\_buffer\_alignment
   * This extension provides a mechanism to query alignment requirements for uniform and storage texel buffers that cannot be well communicated via minTexelBufferOffsetAlignment.
* VK\_EXT\_pipeline\_creation\_cache\_control
   * This extension provides flags that can be used by an application to inquire about potential high cost that could be incurred during pipeline creation. The information can be obtained prior to carrying out the create operation, which would allow the application to adjust its behavior accordingly.

## Fixed Issues

* Frame skipping or choppy audio may be experienced in videos captured using Radeon ReLive.
* Some games may experience stutter while using Instant Replay or third-party applications that stream or perform screen capture.
* Hotkeys may fail to apply to scenes in ReLive scene editor when the scene has a custom name.
* Webcam elements may fail to appear on screen when a custom location is set during ReLive recording.
* AMD A-Series/E-Series APU Processors will reflect older Radeon Software Adrenalin 2019 Edition Settings user interface.
* Zero RPM toggle may fail to reset or appear when disabling advanced fan tuning options in Performance Tuning.
* Radeon Software may automatically close when a live stream is started or stopped.
* Desktop cursor may intermittently remain visible after toggling Radeon Software’s overlay in some games.
* Red Dead Redemption 2™ may experience a blank screen when launched using the Vulkan® API.
* Radeon Software may experience an application crash, or a system TDR may occur, when VRAM reaches 8GB or more with HBCC enabled on Radeon RX Vega series graphics products.
* DOOM™ may experience an intermittent system hang or application crash during gameplay.
* Space Engineers™ may experience an application or hang during gameplay when Grass Density is turned on.
* A system hang or black screen may occur when exiting SteamVR™ with multi display system configurations.
* Monster Hunter World™: Iceborne may have lower than expected performance in some areas of the game on Radeon RX 5700 series graphics products.
* Video playback may exhibit corruption on Interlaced content in Movies and TV on Ryzen 3000 with Radeon Graphics Processors.
* PassMark™ may experience an application hang on some Ryzen with Radeon Graphics Processors.
* On Radeon RX Vega and older discrete GPUs and on APUs, enabling integer display scaling could result in a reduction of frame rate.
* Integer display scaling may not show up as available in Radeon Software on some GCN-based GPUs.

## Known Issues

* Enhanced Sync may cause a black screen to occur when enabled on some games and system configurations. Any users who may be experiencing issues with Enhanced Sync enabled should disable it as a temporary workaround.
* Performance Metrics Overlay and Radeon WattMan incorrectly report higher than expected idle clock speeds on Radeon RX 5700 series graphics products. Performance and power consumption are not impacted by this incorrect reporting.
* Radeon Software may open with an inconsistent window size or may not keep its previously set size when opened.
* Modifying the HDMI Scaling slider may cause FPS to become locked to 30.
* Some games may exhibit stutter intermittently during gameplay on Radeon RX 5000 series graphics products.
* Desktop or In-game corruption may occur intermittently when HDR is enabled.
* Radeon RX Vega series graphics products may experience a system crash or TDR when playing games with Instant Replay enabled. A workaround for users experiencing these issues is to disable Instant Replay.
* A system crash or hang may be experienced when using Edge browser to play Netflix™ content.
* Some users may still experience black screen or system hang issues during extended periods of gameplay. AMD will continue to monitor and investigate reports of these issues closely.",697,1584625568,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fla9q2/adrenalin_2020_edition_2031_released/,Amd,1

fl95kp,mitsosvazelos84,Buy a rtx 2060 gaming laptop now or wait for next gen?,"Hello, 

Because of University and switching between 3 houses,  I decided to sell my desktop and get a gaming laptop and use the desktop peripherals to game when I can. 

I've got my eyes set on an Asus fx505dv, ryzen 7 3750h and an rtx2060 for a thousand euros. 
 But there is a burning question.

Given then prices may rise due to the effect of the virus, and given that the ryzen 4000h series is very close, would it be better to:

 -  Buy the fx505dv now 

 - Wait for it to be discounted due to 4000h series but risk pricing and availability due to the virus or

 - Buy next gen 4000h series laptop when they come out, again risking pricing and availability due to the virus. 

I would like your opinion on the subject.

I am leaning towards the first option because performance for me is reasonable, but most importantly, I believe that the market will be too unstable or the new laptops too expensive in a month or so.

fl8p2l,Cookie2k,Honest Opinion About Compatibility,"Hey everybody,

I am currently in the market to build a new computer it's primarily for gaming and software engineering.

My old systems have been exclusively Intel/Nvidia and I never actually ran into any compatibility issues so far. However I had my fair share of AMD/ATI systems in the past and I remember having a lot of trouble with all sorts of things. Driver issues, RAM compatibility and what not. I've sworn to never spend a dime on an AMD product ever again.

Whoever is building a system right now can't ignore all the praise and hype AMD receives for their recent Ryzen CPUs,  price politics, downward compatibility with AM4 sockets and shaking up the current CPU market. From a consumer point of view, everything looks quite promising and I might settle for a Ryzen 7 3700x on a X570 board and spend the money I've saved on a better Graphics card. My speculation is that future games will utilize more than just 4 cores and that single clock speed is not as important as it is now, thus a 8c/16t cpu might catch up or even become better as soon as software adjusts to the latest hardware development. 

I believe this sounds reasonable on papaer but I'd really like to avoid compatibility issues and tinkering with the system in my spare time. I know some enjoy that and it's part of the fun but I personally don't.

All hype aside, I hope you guys can give me some honest feedback on your overall experience with AMD products lately?

Hello, intel peasant here :)

But am building a new pc after my i5 4670k is finally struggling and on its last legs.....

Decided on the 3700x, seems a decent upgrade, but I’m getting all confused with the motherboards.

I’ve narrowed it down to I need a b450, but may need to flash bios first, or an X570.

£79 difference between the MSI gaming plus max (b450) and the X570 gaming plus Wi-Fi

Leaning towards the X570, as I’ll be using 3600 ddr4, and the 3700x, I have 3HDD and 3 SSD so, might be better there as well.  

People have suggested the chipset fan is a problem?

The PS5 architecture is very similar to the PC, the CPU and GPU have been or will be released on the PC, the PS5 changes clockspeed to the changing gameplay,which is where the ""up to"" comes from. The PS5 is using AMD's Speedshift, this moves power from the CPU to the GPU and Visa-versa. AMD said that is boosts performance by 10% at CES and this may increase to 15-20% by time the PS5 launches. Add on top of this mesh/primitive shaders which may add another 10-20% on top of this and PS5 could be more powerful than the Xbox Series X.

We do not play games, videos, or videos with high image quality. Basically, I'm going to run several VMs at the same time to search, email, and program in the browser, so I don't need a very high quality CPU like the Mac Pro. I can't afford my wallet.

The following are required for this OS: ([Https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/](Https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/))

### Minimum

* 64-bit Intel or AMD processor (x86\_64 aka x64 aka AMD64)
* [Intel VT-x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_.28VT-x.29) with [EPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation#Extended_Page_Tables) or [AMD-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#AMD_virtualization_.28AMD-V.29) with [RVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation#Rapid_Virtualization_Indexing)
* [Intel VT-d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel-VT-d) or [AMD-Vi (aka AMD IOMMU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#I.2FO_MMU_virtualization_.28AMD-Vi_and_Intel_VT-d.29)
* 4 GB RAM
* 32 GiB disk space

### Recommended

* Fast SSD (strongly recommended)
* Intel IGP (strongly preferred)      
   * Nvidia GPUs may require significant [troubleshooting](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/install-nvidia-driver/).
   * AMD GPUs have not been formally tested, but Radeons (RX580 and earlier) generally work well

Also, please tell me about the following questions about CPU.

1. What are cheap and good quality manufacturers? (I don't need brand power.) In my opinion, Intel and AMD are equal in quality. Intel has a higher idea.
2. How long is the life of the CPU? Or how many years should I buy a new one?",9,1584591626,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fl3t3k/what_is_the_cheapest_cpu_that_supports/,Amd,1

fl1ai8,Brokkensteel,Doubts about Ryzen 3000 with X470,"Hello everyone.
So, I've been thinking about upgrading my pc to a Ryzen and just today I saw a store in my country doing a really good promotion on a Ryzen 7 3700x bundled with an Asus Strix X470-F Gaming, that is around 100€ cheaper than any other place I can get both ( I can get the bundle for ~470€)

As far as I've seen x570 boards aren't really worth the premium you pay for the pcie 4.0 am I right? 
Since I am a noob about AMD here I am looking for some guidance.

1st thing is if this is a good mobo to pair the 3700x with?

2nd is about ram. I've seen tons of videos now and the best price performance ram out of the box for Ryzen 3000 seems to be 3600 cl16 and so I was looking at g.skill neo for that. But the mobo has the 3600 as the maximum ram speed it supports. Could that be an issue or I won't be running in to any issue. Or the bios update changes that? I am really confused with this point.

I also don't quite yet understand all that P.B.O thing as stuff but do all the  things work fine in this MOBO ir are there known issues?

Thanks in advance everyone.

fkyn4j,Secret-Misthios,Would I see an fps improvement going from a Ryzen 2600 to a 3800X?,"My 2600 is overclocked to  4.05ghz, and I can't take it any higher under any remotely resonable voltage. Most of the games I play I tend to end up with both GPU/CPU equally maxed, so no huge bottleneck as to yet in either one. As for resolution I game equally on a 60hz 4k hdr tv as well as a 144hz 1080p display. The 1080p is for anything I'd like higher than 100fps on (like Division 2, Diablo, etc). Whereas on the 4k tv is mostly things like Witcher, Fallout 4, Odyssey, and Origins. Its an NU8000 tv so input lag is not bad at all. Granted for some of the most intensive games like Odyssey, I do a mix mostly medium with some high, and lock the framerate at 50fps on the tv. Its smooth and looks amazing.

Going to a noticeable better GPU is just out of the question due to the price needed for anything notable. As for CPU, I **know** I will update sooner than later, if anything to be in som form of parity with the upcoming consoles in 8 cores and 16 threads. Ideally I'd like to keep my motherboard (B450 Tomahawk non max), so after a likely Bios update I'd be looking at mainly the 2700X/3700X/3800X/3900X. Any noticeably better GPU would be twice at that. At the same time if the fps boost in games with my current hardware is going to be neglible (&lt;10 fps avg), then I may as well wait a couple years until any of those cpu are even cheaper. Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. The 5700 XT was an option since my 144hz monitor is Gsync and the 4k TV (50 inch) supports Freesync 2 (variable refresh rate) as well, its just marginally stronger than my current gpu.",34,1584570716,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fkyn4j/would_i_see_an_fps_improvement_going_from_a_ryzen/,Amd,2

Currently waiting on my RX 5700 to arrive in the mail and I have a few questions about flashing the RX 5700 XT bios.


* 1- I plan to flash the 5700 XT bios almost immediately. I plan to run a few benchmarks with the standard bios just for a baseline comparison and then go to the 5700 XT bios. **QUESTION IS** Do I download the RX 5700 or RX 5700 XT drivers from the AMD website?


* 2- After flashing the RX 5700 XT bios, do I need to reinstall drivers? Or just keep it as is and continue business as usual?

* 3- Seeing as I am going to follow the guide on Tech Power Up, they have a variety of 5700 XT bios for this particular card. They only change in the subsystem ID, Do I need to match that? And If so how do I find out what my cards Subsystem ID is?

* 4- I plan to Undervolt and Overclock after flashing the card to get the most out of it. Is there any point of reference of where to start at or just kind of play with it until its stable? My plan was to just undervolt and keep the core frequency as high as possible without crashing and overclocking the memory. Would I see the best outcome like that or would I also have to underclock the frequency as well?

fkwk1d,Fataliity187,How Big is the GPU in XSX and PS5?,"This is just some basic math here to get an idea of what to expect from RDNA2.

**First, Playstation 5::**

    36 CU = 58 GCN CU's (per transistors) which is ~11.328B transistors (Used Vega transistor count as reference) 
    11.328B / 62.82million transistors per mm2 = ~180mm2. (Using 62.82m because that is Renoir's density for transistors, and this is likely similar)

&gt;*I know this includes IO, but the new GPU's will also include IO too. So in reality, it shouldn't be too far off. +/- 20mm2 estimate.*

&amp;#x200B;

**For Xbox Series X, its using same RDNA2 architecture,** ***so we will base it off of what we know about the PS5.***

    56 CU (4 disabled for yield) = 90.22 GCN CU's
    195.31 million transistors per CU * 90.22 = 17.62Billion Transistors
    17.62B / 62.82 (density) = 280.49mm2.

**Xbox Series X is 360.45mm2** \- 280.49mm2 = 80mm2. Zen2 CPU chiplet = 75mm2.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;IO was used in Vega calculation, this is assuming that to cover most of the IO for the whole APU. And in the calculation of the new RDNA2 chips.  
&gt;  
&gt;If we suspect a Renoir-type CPU, that would be about 45mm2, and leave another 35mm2 for more IO.  
&gt;  
&gt;This fits the suspicion, that the density of these new chips on 7nm will be around 62+ mT/mm2.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is not meant to be definitive, but to show what is likely going to be the die sizes of RDNA2, which will also affect cost. EUV layers are cheaper than Quad-Patterning, but more expensive than multi-patterning.

    So a 5700XT with a die size around 200mm2 could potentially compete with a RTX 2080,
    a 5800XT with a ~300mm2 die size could compete with a 2080TI.

This is meant for discussion. So feel free to join in if you wish.

&amp;#x200B;

fkvsac,tubby8,Vega 64 crashing while PC idles - happening frequently over the past week,"Vega 56 and Vega 64 cards have long had issues where they would cause full system crashes/lockups while the PC would be sitting at idle. There have been many discussions about this on AMD's official forum but never really an official response to it over the years.

Other members of the community have recommended fixes such as setting PSU idle control settings, setting minimum memory or gpu clocks to a certain value etc. Those solutions have worked for some but others continue to experience idle crashes.

For the past 6-8 months I haven't had many idle crashes with my Reference Vega 64 but over the past week they have started again, happening more frequently then ever.

I leave my PC alone for 20-30 minutes and I come back to find the system has a black screen with no display, and the only way to recover it is to reboot.

I think I so cruel when selling it on his first birthday but I have made a deal for $520 and the buyer will come by tomorrow. Yeah, when compared to Amazon price it is pretty ridiculous for the 1-year-old card but I got mine $800 ^^ The new 5700XT now cost $550-650 in my country.

I'm confused because it is currently AMD high-end graphics card but it performs worse than RX5700XT in some new titles as RDR2 and COD, FH4,... and maybe the upcoming Resident Evil 3. While Vega 56 and 64 now still outperform their competitors that they lost in 2017. When I first bought R7 I think there will be a sweet driver coming for me every month so that it can beat 2080 but I'm here today and see nothing but crashed. The performance doesn't increase like the way the driver did to Polaris, old Vega. RIS is good but trivial.

 The compute performance is greater than the new rdna but performs worse because of architecture and AMD now put all efforts into the new RDNA architecture. New games, apps will be intensively optimized for RDNA because It makes profits and vega didn't. Hmm, I think I got my answer ^^ I will sell it and wait for big Navi or RDNA2. AMD competitor also introduces a new product line in Q3 so they will fight and maybe I can get the new RDNA2 cards or 5700XT with the price drop.

I had it with earlier 20.x.x versions as well and thus have been using 19.12.1 since this is the last known most stable version for me, however i would like to upgrade just because i think i should be able to but the screen flickering is nuts. It doesnt occur of the bat but as soon as i open a game or a video it starts slightly but stops and its fine in the video or game, but when alt+tabbing, switching monitors or closing the game or video it goes mental, the screen keeps ""flickering"" its not going black and back again it just ""flickers"" if thats a way to describe it, sorry english is not my native language.

I have 3600 proc, the RX580 and 16GB ram G.skill.

fkrgl9,artielange84,Are AMD drivers in Linux stable compared to Windows 10?,"I've owned an ASUS Vega 64 for about a year and a half. I've had black screen problems since July 2019. I've tried everything including replacing ever part in my machine from power supply down to my display port and HDMI cables, all the while with this black screen problem. Triple screen set up with 2700x, MSI x470 Gaming Plus, 16GB Gskill 3200.

Just recently, on 20.2.2, I started seeing my machine hang whenever I'd ALT TAB out of a game running in full screen. 

It's been frustrating so I decided to try selling the card. I really don't want to because it's a great card for my budget and I'm actually having a bit of trouble selling it.

I play games on Steam, Origin, Battle.net, the usual stuff. I do  software development with this machine too. My daily driver.

I have no problem using Debian based distros. I would either go safe with Ubuntu but I've also read people's good experiences with PopOS and others so I'm ready to make the switch mentally. What's been stopping me is all this NTFS storage I have that's practically full without any backup. 

I'm just looking for a way to work with a stable machine and not have to worry about the next crash or what is running and if its hardware accelerated or spamming refresh on AMDs driver page. I want to make the most cost effective decision too. I intended to sell my card for around as much as I can in order to get a 1080 or maybe even a 1080ti if I can find one.

So should I get a big drive (12tb +) backup everything, and install Linux? Will I still have issues?

Or should I keep trying to sell my card because these problems still exist under Linux?

fknzzi,Elsyy,HOT Ryzen 5 2600,"Hi guys, I did my first build 3 weeks ago. I have had problem on top of problem ever since. I was getting temps above 90 often. I went back into my bios and set my ram back to auto from ddr4 3200mhz and the temps dropped from idle average idle of 55 down to 40 so big 15 degree difference. GREAT. But now my idle temps sit at 40 but spike to 50 all the time and I have no idea why, and when gaming I was seeing temps above 80 often and sometimes even low 90s then when I first changed ram back to auto in bios i was only getting low 70s on full load. Now it’s back up to 84 on full load again. I can’t figure it out.

Here’s some info:

Stock cooler on Ryzen 5 2600
Asus B450M-A motherboard
Sapphire Radeon RX 5500 XT 8gb graphics
Corsair vengeance pro 3200mhz ddr4
550w gold Corsair psu
Deepcool mattrex 50 case w/ 3 stock fans

Here’s what I don’t understand, I reduced the ram and it dropped all temps by 15 degrees, I thought it was all good. And all of a sudden it’s decided to be a pain again. All I did was download feed the beast and dedicate 8gb of ram to it, but it wasn’t running when under full load playing call of duty warzone.

if the ram is dedicated when the game is not open will it stay dedicated?

I’m looking at upgrading to a hyper 212 cpu cooler and maybe even upgrade cpu while I’m at it, thoughts?

Can anyone shed some light on my ram settings in bios please? I have not touched anything else in bios. I’m not interested in overclocking.",24,1584530687,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fknzzi/hot_ryzen_5_2600/,Amd,1

fknnox,Twinzenn,New Ryzen 3600 and voltages+temp fluctuate wildly.,"When in BIOS (MSI Mortar Max mobo) my CPU stays at around 38C temp with voltages starting at 1.482 lowering to around 1.466-70 and staying in that range constantly. 

After booting my PC to windows however these start wildly fluctuating. I  have setup Core Temp to startup right as windows start and temps are at around 70 when booted and voltages in the high 1.4 range. The fluctuate around those high points then slowly start ramping down but still spiking heavily to higher ranges. The lowest voltage I get is 0.9312 and highest I've seen is 1.4625 once, which interestingly is lower than what I see in BIOS when booting it up. Most consistent high is 1.4500

After around 10-15 minutes of uptime the voltage settles down a bit and is most consistently at the 0.9312 value, like 90% of the time, with frequencies at 2199.11Mhz and temps at around 36C, but spiking to around 45C occasionally even without voltage spikes. Though voltages and frequencies keep spiking still occasionally to high ranges.

Temperatures are 35C min and 76C max from boot to around 30 minutes uptime. Voltages 0.9312 to 1.4500 with these being the most consistent low and high points. Frequencies are 2199 to 4150mhz. But lots of spikes up and down between these values.

These values are all monitored while completely idle right after booting and doing nothing. Some background programs ofc running.

I've read that these fluctuations for the most part are normal with Ryzen? but they still worry me because it's not something I've ever encountered with my PC before. **And also my fans all seem to be tied to the CPU temp so they of course fluctuate too and so my PC is constantly revving up and down in fan speed and volume, this is the most annoying part.** 

Other thing that worries me is the temperature rising around +10 degrees (celsius) occasionally while at lowest voltages and load. I understand the temps rising with voltage and load rises but this happens at the lowest voltage and frequency sometimes. Then it can jump to 60C+ when the spikes are higher, thought these last mere seconds, but still over 60C when completely idle bothers me.

My BIOS is at complete default settings I even cleared the CMOS to be sure. All my 3 fans (1 rear 2 front) are at DC setting, but me 2 front fans are PWM fans so I don't know why it doesn't default to that.

I'm using stock cooler for now since my CPU cooler is still not delivered.",1,1584528750,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fknnox/new_ryzen_3600_and_voltagestemp_fluctuate_wildly/,Amd,1

A while ago I got the 2700x and I'm really happy with it except for one thing. I have a weird problem with my keyboard which I've narrowed down to the fact that it's not really compatible with the BIOS I have. 

I was looking into updating the BIOS and while looking through the threads here and on some other sites I've noticed that quite a few people have problems with their rigs after updating. 

Which BIOS version would you recommend as being a stable and reliable one? 

The specs are:

* Motherboard: Asus Prime X470 Pro
* BIOS Version: American Megatrends Inc. 0222, 2/9/2018
* OS: Windows 10 Pro 1903
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700x
* Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 2x8Gb 3000Mhz C15
* GPU: MSI Radeon R9 390 8Gb
* PSU: Corsair CS650M
* Storage: 128Gb SSD + 500Gb HDD
* Keyboard: Fnatic Gear Rush G1

**The problem** I'm facing is that randomly the keyboard is turning off and on again for a split second and if at that moment there is a key pressed, it considers the key as being kept pressed and it types the same key like 20 times and then it stops. 

I checked every USB setting I could find and everything seems to be OK. I tried every single USB port on my PC and it's still the same. I tried my keyboard on my laptop and two other PC's and it works just fine and I've also tried two keyboards on my PC and they both work great. I've reached out to Fnatic and they told me that one other person had this exact same rig and problem and he solved it by updating the BIOS.

In December I built a system with a 3600x and 5700xt pulse and mostly no issues. However, yesterday evening I bumped the PC on the right of the front panel lightly and suddenly it has started making a high pitched noise. This noise happens only in games and when I alt tab and the game isn't on screen it disappears.

I had been messing with undervolting with ancient gameplay's profile and I'm afraid that may have broken something. I tried reinstalling the gpu drivers and chipset drivers and that didn't help. I'm pretty sure the sound I'm hearing is called coil whine.

Additionally, when I was messing with undervolting in the Radeon software, after I closed my game I noticed my card was staying at 2000mhz constantly while idle in the desktop. Then I went back to the default settings but it didn't lower the frequency so I restarted the PC and I was back to normal idle frequency. Could that have something to do with the sound?

Can someone please explain to me why it suddenly started happening 3 months after I bought my parts and if there is anything I can do to fix it?

fkl6dg,chuzziny,"Thank you, AMD.","To start, I've been a gamer since I was 6 (I'm 16 now). I first started PC gaming using my Uncle's computer in late 2018. Mostly played Fortnite and Destiny 2 but whatever. Skip to late July of 2019 and Me and My Mom move out to our own place. I'm pretty entangled with the high framerates and the skill level that I am so I tell my mother that I want to build my own computer. I show her the Parts list and she's ok with it. A thing I wasn't too decided on was on a GPU but it couldn't be more than 450$. This was right after NVIDIA's SUPER release so the market was in a weird state. I check Newegg and see that they have a 2070 Strix for only 400$ but just at that price point there's this new AMD GPU that outperforms it for the same price. The 5700 XT seemed really good and performance was going to get better as new drivers came out. Little would I know that the decision of me picking AMD over NVIDIA would impact my life for the foreseeable future. Anyways, parts are ordered, build goes perfectly fine. At this point, we don't have internet yet so I have to wait a bit. Skip to when I'm playing Destiny 2 a few days later and I get my first BSOD. Never got one before so I kinda ignored it. Next come the absurd amount of game crashes and BSOD's. I looked up the error codes I get and they are related to drivers. Later, a friend and other people told me to sell my GPU before I regretted it. I would just reply to them that things would be fixed quickly.  Out of these past 7 months since I built my PC, there was NEVER a single second in where my computer worked as it was supposed to due to poor drivers. My computer has blue screened more times than I can count because of my card and games don't fare well either. I have reinstalled Windows 5 times, tried every driver version since 19.7.1, switched out the RAM twice and have uninstalled and reinstalled drivers numerous times. I never sold my GPU because I had hope in AMD. That hope has now turned into anger, envy, and regret. I see these new people build their first PC's and have no issues at all. I was never one to lash out on inanimate objects but now I do. Nothing Interests me anymore. I can't play a game without it not crashing and can't use my computer without it not randomly blue screening. At this point, I can't sell my GPU so I'm stuck with it. I at least want to give props to the Driver team for fixing the black screen Issues which I funnily rarely got so yeah, Epic! I feel like the prime example of the condition called Radeon Regret and to you guys with working computers running AMD cards, you should feel lucky and proud of yourselves. 

Thank you AMD for making my life and gaming experience shit these past few months.

fkl4h0,phr3dly,Benchmarking Epyc On A Budget,"My company runs a particular single-threaded workload on a moderate sized compute farm. These are single-core jobs, and our license costs dwarf hardware costs. So we should be looking for the best single-core performance for our workload.

Currently we're running Skylake CPUs but are planning our next refresh. While the default is to go Intel because we are guaranteed OS/software compatibility, I would like to benchmark an Epyc platform. Our IT department isn't staffed to do this, so I'm planning to purchase one out of pocket for the exercise.

For about $1500 I can get a dell pizza-box with a 7262 (8C, 128MB cache, 3.2GHz). If we were to purchase in high volume, we would likely be targeting the 2S 48-/64-core variants. Those aren't in my budget.

My assumption is that for single-core performance testing on a 7262 should give me similar results to what I'd get on a larger system. Is that a pretty safe assumption? Obviously there are other considerations like L3/core and bandwidth/core, but I plan to use a stress-ng profile to try to equalize those to the larger core versions.",15,1584513357,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fkl4h0/benchmarking_epyc_on_a_budget/,Amd,1

CPU amd i6-6300 fx 
GPU MSI Rx 480 8Gb
RAM: 8GB Kingston (2x4gb) 

I’m currently running the most up to date driver 20.2.1 and the game stutters and audio cuts out momentarily at seemingly random times. I’ve used MSI’s Afterburner to watch my computer’s stats as I play and while things do hit ceilings, nothing is ever bogged down completely. When I first launched the game I was running an out dated driver in the 17 series and the game was completely unplayable, like I could barely navigate around a tree let alone drop in to the battlefield.

Today, I replaced the paste, but when I turn it on, I notice that my CPU is running around 90°C. I feel my glass panel and it's warm, but not blazing hot. I put my hand behind my PC and the air being blown out isn't hot. And then my PC shuts off. The only thing I had differently was position my liquid cooler's hoses different so that it isn't nudging the GPU. So, I open up my PC again, put my liquid cooler back into it's original position, close things up, and turn it on once more. Now, Ryzen Master is reading my CPU temps at over 100°C. And I've no idea wtf. I feel like a sensor might be fucked because when I felt my glass panel and the air being blown out, things feel pretty cool. Also for the record, the reason why I keep feeling things out is because when I first installed a CPU liquid cooler, I installed it incorrectly and THAT was fucking hot. But anyways, what should I do??

fkhwk1,XTrid92,AMD performance concerns vs. Intel: Benchmarks vs User Experience,"Fam:

I am far from a fanboy. My first build was in 2008 with an Intel Core 2 Duo E8400. After Battlefield: Bad Company 2 came out, I needed to upgrade to a quad-core as my CPU became a bottleneck. At the time, the Phenom II X4 965 was a strong performer, great value, and over-clockable! 

This was where the first red flag occurred though. I noticed the Phenom II underperforming my previous Intel chip in many applications and games. I had it OC'd to a higher clock speed than my previous chip, faster RAM, running an SSD, it made no sense. 

After two short years I upgraded to an Intel Core i5-4690K. This chip remained in my build until November 2018. I used it for games, music creation, streaming/gaming simultaneously on the same PC. I paired it with a GTX770 and ran it into the ground for four years.

I wanted a better streaming experience while gaming and didn't want to deal with the hassle of having a second PC and a capture card, so last year I upgraded to a Ryzen 7 2700X, OC'd it to 4.3 GHz on all cores with 16GB 3400MHz DDR4 RAM. I threw a GTX1080 in there for good measure.

Performance fucking plummeted. Every game was slower while streaming. PUBG? Previous build I'd average 90-100 FPS while streaming. This one? Less than 40 with drops into the 10's.

I have friends with i7-9700K's who get better performance despite having much less encoding strength.

So I set processor affinity. No change. Reset my encoder settings. No change. I removed the OC'd and kept the XMP profile on the RAM. No change. Stock clocks. No change. Fresh install. No change. 100% SSD storage conversion. No change. Different game. No change. G-Sync off. No change. 60Hz monitor instead of 144Hz 1440p. No change. 

What gives? The only thing I can assume is that it's more AMD weirdness like I experienced with every other AMD product I've ever owned (2 CPU's and 3 GPU's, 4 GPU's technically counting my HD6970 Crossfire build).

It makes no sense. I'm a fan of objectivity and data and everyone is getting different results than me. my streaming/encoding while gaming performance should cream Intel.

For the record, this isn't a tech support thread. I'm 9/10 hardware knowledge and has reached out to multiple companies that provide the software I'm using (Ubisoft, Bluehole, OBS, Streamlabs, Twitch, etc.) as well as my engineering friends and no one can give me a reason. I'm purely reaching out to see if anyone has had similar experiences and is getting kind of fed up with AMD.

fkctwk,epicledditaccount,How good a purchase is the 5700XT now that the new xbox specs have been released?,"I really need a new GPU (GTX 970 isn't too great at 1440p) and had set my sights on the 5700XT, especially now that many driver issues have been fixed. 

However the xbox reveal has made me second guess that, not because I want to buy a console, but because the APU seems to be surprisingly powerful. I'm especially 'worried' about the emphasis they put on ray tracing. Many game devs will develop around console capabilities, so could there soon be a situation where games are very badly playable on a 5700xt because of ""only"" 8GBs, or even not able to be launched at all because of a lack of ray tracing capability? 

I would want to use the 5700 for the next 5 years at least as I don't mind dialing down settings to high or medium. Now I am debating waiting for big navi/nvidia 3000 releases, even though I want to buy something new sooner rather than later.

fka10b,Burton1224,3950x/3900x water cooler,"Hi there

Is someone of you using a 3900x or a 3950x, waterblock best case a EK Velocity one, and liquid metal in between?
Just recognized EK Velocity coolers have a convex contact area but the R9's are flat, means a Velocity is not making much contact with the 3900x/3950x die if you apply LM also the thicker IHS leads to a not perfectly mounting  possibility with the EK screws for the velocity. 
Looks like R3 R5 R7 processors have a concave IHS due to the fakt that EK says the Velocity are just for the R3 R5 R7 and not R9. 

Someone who experienced the same on his processors?

Did you just sand the Velocity flat or what kind of solution did you went for?

fk9y47,Caterpillar_,Matisse+X470 dual channel on any RAM slot?,"My system has a Ryzen Matisse CPU (Ryzen 5 3600), an ASRock X470 Taichi ultimate and two RAM slots of  KSM26ED8/16ME (each one ECC RAM 16GB 2Rx8 PC4-2666)

The motherboard has A1, A2, B1, B2 RAM slots. When I had to install the hardware components, I thought it was okay to install them on A1, A2, since they were the RAM slots that were close. After some weeks while speaking with a friend, I found out that I may have installed the RAM banks on the wrong slots.

[ASRock documentation](https://asrock.com/MB/AMD/X470%20Taichi%20Ultimate/index.asp#Specification) for Matisse CPU is the following

https://preview.redd.it/elnxp4rlv9n41.png?width=361&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4affb65a1461c9ea502a626565ad44e0b6e2774

&amp;#x200B;

so concerning table rows for 2666 MHz DR RAM, it seems that I could install the two RAM slots anywhere, but I am afraid of not having dual channel enabled. What do you think about? Moving the RAM costs me to disassemble the entire machine, including the heatsink. Moreover putting RAM in B1 and B2 needs to move a bit the second fan of Noctua NH-D15, so it would be quite problematic to do..

Than I thought about RX480 with RX580 BIOS, but there I would need one with 100% working BIOS and Strix OC would be best coz of (I believe from what I read) best cooling capabilities of all RX480 cards.
Found one, but seller already bricked two cards and is not willing to play with more.... (there I would pay ~400 PLN = ~100$).

Than I found, here on reddit, info that RX480/580 + RX470/570 would be practically same as two RX480/580. That gave me more field to look for cards.
And I found ""holy grail"" - Nitro 8GB for 280 PLN (70$). Only problem it is mining one.

I also went to the extent of changing the HDMI cable thinking the issue was still on my side, but no, nothing is wrong with the cable or monitor. For the time being I only have Freesync enabled and have disabled HDMI Link Assurance, Anti-Lag and Enhanced Sync (which comes disabled by deafult with the latest drivers anyway because of some issue mentioned in the release notes) and everything seems to work fine, for now.

2. XfX DD ultra. $330. Hard to find a lot of in depth reviews on this one. Apparently shares some design elements with the 5700 xt thicc 3 which had launch issues. 

3. Powercolor two fan model (8GBD6). Also a bit hard to get info about. Pretty basic but that isn't always bad. Also $330

4. Powercolor Red dragon. Probably the best of the 4 but at $360 it is $60 more expensive than the evoke (or $90 after MIR). Doesn't seem worth it.

fk2xe5,uzzi38,RDNA2 in the Xbox Series X is probably more efficient than we first thought.,"So I was watching and reading all the coverage of the XBoxSeX, and reached Austin Evan's video, where he mentions the 300W PSU.

Now, that's already impressive, but at one point in the video you can see the specifications of the PSU itself. [It's actually a 315W PSU and has two outputs - a 255W and a 60W output](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/682675911488700419/689150471625375750/unknown.png). This can be seen at 12:37, I've posted a screenshot to make it easier to see.

Now, looking at the motherboard, I think the 255W output is for the SoC, GDDR6 memory, NVMe+Expansion and the HDMI2.1 port. The 60W output is for the rest of the I/O board.

Now, onto working out how much each portion of the SoC uses, I'd like to start off by mentioning that Microsoft leave a lot of overhead with their PSUs. The XBOneX had a 245W PSU, but the console never pulled more than 180W. Here, I'm going to take a rather mild estimate of 225W for the SoC, because simply put, I can't justify any more. The power draw of the GPU portion even with that feels too low for what one would expect. Yeah. I know.

So taking the 225W number, lets knock off the easy part. 4W for the NVMe and expansion each - Microsoft gave us that number, so I'm going to round those and the HDMI2.1 to 10W for convenience. That leaves 215W for CPU, GPU and GDDR6 memory.

As for the CPU, well let me point you towards a review of Renoir by a Chinese guy [just yesterday.](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/113142604) You'll need Google Translate I'm afraid (or let Chrome do it for you, like I do normally), but they give one important piece of information in there.

When the Renoir chip settles down in clocks while running Cinebench, it pulls 39W to maintain 3.5GHz. The XBoxSeX is supposed to run at 3.66GHz with SMT enabled, so an estimate of about 45W for the CPU seems fair as a worst case scenario. 

That leaves about 170W for the GPU+GDDR6 memory. The GPU in question being a 52CU chip running at 1825MHz.

Now, important things to note: **this is just an estimate based off many assumptions. It is by no means actual power figures.** 

Next thing to note is the estimation that the SoC, GDDR6 memory, NVMe+Expansion and HDMI2.1 get a 225W budget out of a 255W output. It goes without saying, this is not only an estimate, but a very conservative one given the XBOneX had a much larger difference between power budget and max power draw. But I'd rather take something closer to a worst case scenario than a best case scenario, so here we are.

Now, another thing to note is that I estimated the CPU power draw based off figures using Renoir. That's assuming the console's CPU has the same power efficiency characteristics as Renoir, however things such as density and power efficiency may not hold up like I talk about here. The XBoxSeX appears to sport a rather low density compared to Renoir - almost 2/3rds the density. 

Last thing to note is - **do not expect desktop RDNA2 to exhibit this same efficiency out of the box.** Without a doubt, desktop RDNA2 will be clocked higher than this if my estimation here is accurate. There's absolutely no chance AMD won't take advantage of this kind of efficiency to bump clocks higher. Keep that in mind if you feel like discussing desktop RDNA2. And remember - power l/perf is not linear. 

As you ramp up clocks, it will take exponentially more power to do so. Seriously, I cannot understate that. This post should not be taken to mean that AMD will be pumping out a GPU with 80CUs that can clock twice as high or something silly. Again, please remain realistic with your expectations. Even considering this showing for RDNA2, I'm still not confident on the ""Nvidia Killer"" rumours or anything like that, but I will state that it lends a lot of credence to AMD's +50% power efficiency claim with RDNA2. And that's something to be excited about. Just don't start overhyping.

TL;DR - the GPU portion of the XBoxSeX could be pulling around 170W for 2080 Super or higher performance, which is about 30% more perf for 25% less power than the 5700XT. Desktop RDNA2 will be clocked higher, so won't be as efficient, but this is a very solid sign that AMD could meet their own target and that large power efficiency gains with RDNA2 are a reality.",414,1584440599,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fk2xe5/rdna2_in_the_xbox_series_x_is_probably_more/,Amd,1

fk2to4,Tiboid_na_Long,System Crash while using Folding at Home (FAH) if display is turned off,"Hi everyone.

With the recent increase in efforts to fight COVID-19 via Folding at Home (F@H) I, too, joined and wanted to add my system to the effort. Since then both CPU (Ryzen 5 2600) and GPU (PowerColor RX 5700 Red Devil XT) are working happily to help.

I did notice though that my system keeps freezing and crashing if the display is turned off while F@H is working in the background. One solution (as suggested by u/fefos93 in the [main thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fi489l/help_with_the_fight_against_sarscov2_from_home/fkgyirn/)) is to just disable turning the display off via the energy settings.

Since I have to work from home now I need to use my display for work. I connected my work laptop to it via HDMI (the private PC is connected via DP) so I can use it as a secondary display. My private PC with F@H is working in the background. But this again results in system crashes if switched to HDMI that force me to hard reset my PC.

I already reported my findings to AMD and I am encouraging everyone [to do so as well](http://www.amd.com/report). I just wanted to ask if anybody else has noticed this behaviour and if so, if there are possible solutions.

I'd really like to support F@H and science, but it isn't really helpful at all to restart my computer every 20 minutes.",31,1584440007,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fk2to4/system_crash_while_using_folding_at_home_fah_if/,Amd,1

fk29dj,Yiannis97s,I just got a free RX 480 4GB -- I had to do something during quarantine,"A few months ago I bought a used RX 480 4GB from an auction on ebay for 116€. It was crashing all the time and the whole computer would freeze if I tried to load any game/ stress-test.  
I asked and got a full refund because the ebay listing said ""like new"" and ""barely used"". I sent him a video to demonstrate it and the seller didn't ask me to send him the card back.

However, someone had written ""4 . 2"" on the back of the GPU and it got me thinking that the previous owner was using it for mining. That mark was probably to identify the cards on his mining rigs. 

After more than 2 months I decided to flash the BIOS with  what would be the ""defaults"", just in case he had edited the BIOSes for better mining yields. I have way too much time lately... The card now works fine. 

I don't game much anymore so I hope I can keep it for a couple of years at least. I just wanted an AMD gpu because I'm using linux and I didn't want the Nvidia proprietary drivers on my system.

TLDR: If you get a used card on ebay, stress-test it and if it is ""broken"", ask for a refund and send proof that its broken. Hopefully he wont want to pay return shipping and you will keep the card.

fjs58q,rayquaza2510,High 3700x voltage while playing DS emulators,"So before posting this I did think about where to post it, here or on the r/emulation but in the end I decided to post it here as it is more a CPU question.

So I started to play some old DS games again using DeSmuME (version 0.9.11 x64), the last time I did this was on my old i5 6400 rig.

So I saw while running some tools that while playing any DS game my voltage was around 1,41 to 1,45v all the time (I don't have a OC'ed CPU, all stock), I know the 3700x does boost the voltage in some cases and that is totally normal behaviour, but it is all the time like this when playing DS games (I tried solething older like No$GBA and same happened)

In case of DeSmuME Task manager says that the total CPU usage hovers around 12% to 15% (seems normal to me), from what 2 cores seem to be active while doing so.

My temperatures are also normal, most of the time around 45C when playing DS games.

So my question is this, is this normal and safe? Again I know that the CPU voltage boost is normal to the 3700x, but I have until now never seen this happenening on my PC so I wonder if this is normal and safe (I asked a friend that has a 3800x to test the emulator for me, in his case same happened)",6,1584391844,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fjs58q/high_3700x_voltage_while_playing_ds_emulators/,Amd,1

I've narrowed it down to the following (in order):

&amp;#x200B;

1)  [Motile](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Vega-HDMI-720p-Front-RAM-Rose-FHD-8GB-display-AMD-Tuned-Radeon-14-Ryzen-Gold-THX-Graphics-IR-SSD-Laptop-MOTILE-5-Spatial-256GB-8-Performance-Audio-HD/909076408) R5 3500U [$420](https://youtu.be/IRBAZJ4lF0U)

&amp;#x200B;

Each of these seems to have their Pros and Cons.   


The main thing I like about the Nitro is the 560x I would be able to game better, but laptop gaming I'd probably only be playing eSports titles anyway. So the dGPU isn't a big factor for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, not set on 3500U vs. 2500U. For the workloads, I'll be doing, I won't notice the differences. I just couldn't find any 2500U laptops that didn't look like they were 20 years old.

fjobc2,aranorde,"Owners of RX 5500 XT, how is it?","# TLDR :  I want to know,

1. Are the drivers stable?
2. Any issues you have experienced with it (Black Screen/Stutter/Freeze/Crash)?

If you have the time, read below.

Please do not reply with ""buy rx 580""! Understand my situation and help me decide, please.

Under lock-down due to the virus, in serious need of GPU for work and spare time gaming. Almost all the options are sold out (with no real ETA on new stock from retailers) and my current options are [ASUS 1650 Super ROG Strix](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/ROG-STRIX-GTX1650S-O4G-GAMING/) the expensive version at $190 or [ASUS 5500 XT Dual Evo](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/DUAL-RX5500XT-O8G-EVO/) at $210. 

I feel like instead of spending a whooping $190 (my budget range) on a 1650 Super with extra blings which I dont even care about, paying $20 more and getting the RX 5500 XT would be reasonable, 8GB RAM and everything! But i want to know if it is stable enough to be considered as an option.

And there are no 1660 Super/1660 or Polaris to be found under my budget (they are $240 and upwards, even for the shitty 1660 TUF edition), people just straight bought all the cards and now some are re-selling to utilize the situational-buying-panic, which i will not support. I can order them online but it will take more than a month at minimum with the current situation and custom procedures. Plus if I need to RMA, that will screw up the time even more and buying from a local retailer helps a bit in that area.

fjlfuj,BeWanderlustful,Ryzen 4000 - Will early adoption be worth it?,"For those of us looking to upgrade our desktop processors, Q3/Q4 2020 seems just around the corner. Take into consideration the overall cost to upgrade a machine that might only be a year or two old, to a PCIe 4.0 machine, one will start to wonder if early adoption of the Ryzen 4000 series will be worth the wait, or if we should just upgrade now. Of course there is always the option of waiting for the Ryzen 4000 only to grab a Ryzen 3000 at a discounted price (one would hope).

If you compare the Ryzen Mobile 2000 and 3000 to the Ryzen Mobile 4000, we see an increase in cache (doubled in most instances), and 2 to 4 more cores. If you compare the top tier AMD Mobile CPUs from 2000, 3000, and 4000, on paper the performance increase seems very lackluster. Yes, this is just lowly laptop tech to us desktop users, and for gamers, this isn't a significant increase - most games aren't taking advantage of 8 cores, never mind the 12 or 16 cores currently available to us (a ludicrous amount more if you go the Threadripper route).

So with a seemingly mediocre improvement in performance in the mobile segment, what are your expectations for Ryzen 4000 desktop CPUs? A mediocre improvement, or blazing fast single core speeds? Will Ryzen 3000 owners be early adopters, and will outdated Red Team users be looking to upgrade to the 4000, or maybe just look to get a great deal on a 3000 series processor?

Curiously it does save the fan settings, so once I'm in the bios and my fans are running at max speed again, if I change one random setting (doesn't have to be fan related) it recognises my earlier set profiles.

fjj1xh,ScofieldxD,Modern Warfare Warzone Issues (texture and loading texture),"So I just bought a new AMD PC,

specs:

\- Ryzen 5 3600x

\- Sapphire nitro+ radeon rx 5500 xt 8gb

Drivers: Adrenaline 20.2.2 (the latest one)

Video of issue(im not the only one having it): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvvXew3pMRo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvvXew3pMRo)

I tried playing call of duty modern warfare war zone and heuston, we do have a problem.

Simple explaination:

The textures looks like something straight out of counter strike source and it takes ages to load into a game even though i have 3ping and 100/100 up and down internet speed...

Explanation:

Long story short this is most likely something to do with the drivers and my specific components, but anyways, i´ve seen a 99% load on my graphics card when im playing the game on descent quality, it runs smoothly and i have good FPS, as it should be since these are quite high end components afterall, but the problem is that rendering the textures and curves of objects seems to take alot of time, and no matter what texture settings i put into the settings it still doesnt increase quality, i can have the highest setting and it looks worse than when i have medium settings, i think this is something to do with the drivers and that my graphics card is under such heavy load it just takes time to render maps and textures. I'm wondering if someone can help me with this? i also get a crashing error saying dev error 6320 and so on. I cant reset the shaders ingame because of some other bug and its all buggy to say the least, but what im most conserned about is that my graphics card is under constant heavy load no matter my settings almost and that the textures take really long time to load, sometimes it doesnt even load and i have to play without bushes grass and houses and so on..  any amd expert maybe can help? :)",0,1584355773,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fjj1xh/modern_warfare_warzone_issues_texture_and_loading/,Amd,1

fjif0h,Ganakas,"Ryzen 2700 , Actual Overclocking Tips 144fps High /Ultra 1660TI / Radeon 5700","See alot of folks  asking about   this Chip as sometimes u can find it  as low as 120 -140 bucks now and lower with promos.  2 cores , 4 threads extra  for esentially  8 or 9 dollars per thread  vs the 1600 AF.  


I also see alot of folks who  perhaps  have watched Youtube videos  or  own a 2700x  give  information to these people that isn't  accurate.  Im not bashing any of you but  after having spent a year with the 2700 non X  , I have maybe  a bit more  understanding of how it behaves.  


First ,  Yea  as many have mentioned you can  simply  use the base multiplier and Lock it to a static all core overclock  of 4.1 / 4.25    MAYBE 4.3 if you have  really great luck and  managed to get a better than average  chip.   But do you really want to run this  thing at 1.38  -1.45  volts    ?  Maybe you would if you do alot of  heavy multi thread work on your  system , in which case  Sure go ahead and do that  for  the length of time u are running those programs.  


While Gamers Nexus and other youtube channels commonly display  benchmark #'s  for comparison in GAMING &lt;--  with this processor included ...they seemingly always  list a static all core OC.  


This  isn't what you want to do.     Currently I believe at 1940  Im due to be #5 or 6?  On Hwbot  for Cinebench R15 scores on this  chip.    With THAT setup , the one thats#1 for 2700's (atleast  US based) on [userbenchmark.com](https://userbenchmark.com) 's  list   I get  maybe 460-470 single thread scores on CPUZ.   as  Static all core clocks actually lower your single threaded performance.  


And while as many new owners have mentioned the processor  can and will get stuck at 3.4  and throttle down from that  even on heavy loads.      At stock the  2700 will give u  I dunno  390-400 single thread on CPUZ depending on  ram configuration (Frequency primarily tho latency will have an impact too)      


""Real world"" example.    With a 1660 TI  flashed  to increase power  limit to 125%   a stock  2700 with   3333mhz CL 14 (all timings tightened) Hynix  memory kit will net you about 100-110 Fps  high settings on battlefield 5 at 1080p.  Problem  is you will notice  really hard dips down to 50 and 60.  Same is True + or -  2 fps in Apex Legends while the games dont share an engine for whatever reason they are nearly identical   at 1080p  for  performance Req's .  


Note the   CL 14 ram kit ...that started as a cheap  3200 cl16/18/18/18/38 xmp  kit (junk)  You are looking at anywhere from 10-20fps just by  dealing with the ram kit u  pick.   I suggest skipping 3200 CL16  .  If you can't run the ram at 3333  /3400    CL 14 ...don't bother with it unless like me u enjoy overclocking  and wasting time ALOT.  


If the chip u end up with has a fantastic memory controller u might  run a hynix kit at 3600 /16  but  its unlikely .  Samsung kit a different story tho.  


Anyway     Long story short ...the youtube channels are wrong (often it seems)   But u can't hate on them , they have ALOT of hardware to  mess with and unlike u they aren't going to be spending potentially years with any specific piece of hardware .  


Stock =  suck , All core  OC = good for benchmarks ,   lists and  rough on the  chip itself and while  it will give u a better Frame rate and   frame  pace than stock ,  its not worth it  and  honestly they shouldn't use it with this chip in  comparison  Gaming benchmarks.

3 Hours of BFV(or Apex)  @ 1080p   1660 TI   Core oc  to 2100mhz max (avg 1965ish) Leave memory alone  12gbs vs 14gbs = 1 to 1.5 fps at 1080p worthless , Memory speed on the Super is just a marketing ploy  worthless for the resolution the card is intended for and yea u can just clock the TI  to 14gbs  and beyond , just  no point in it.  waste of power draw.  
Or if you have say a 5700 non XT     clocked to 1975 mhz (avg 1820ish)       Here is  
what you can expect   capping frames at 143 on a 144hz monitor  from this  processor  and these two  graphics cards  or similiar ones.  


1660  , all high settings    raytracing off (most  nvidia ""quality settings to normal or off)    
143 max(as capped by rivatuner)   140 avg .  U ""Might"" notice it drop down to 128 here or there.  
Radeon 5700  all Ultra settings , sharpening to 80%  all  Driver quality settings set to High  in the Amd driver software window.  
143max (capped)  141 avg   


493  cpu Z score. For reference  the 2700X &lt;--  with its Pbo  nets 488 on cpuz  Singlethread score.     With the following overclock  ..a FULL size case with  240mm Aio cooling it   in push PLUS pull configuration (two fans either side of rad)       it will average 46 C  , max around 53 .    with the min being in the mid 30's.       Max power draw  89watts  avg 65w .      (all core 1920-1940 Cb15  4.325 static  OC  pulls well over 100 watts if u care about 50 cents a year  or the life of your chip)  


How  is this accomplished?  


Simple   Disable global C states .   , If your Mobo has a CTDP  setting ....change it to manual      depending on the  unit of measurement it uses  you either need to set it 1300 (stock setting is 700) or this is   Wattage  in heat.  Not  power draw don't be scared.          
change your LLC setting  from Auto to  the 2nd  to last  setting your mobo provides. Generally the last setting  has no  offset  or potentially an overvolt.   whilet he 2nd to last setting is effectively  Zero as in it doesn't  impact  the voltage to your CPU positively or negatifvely enough to matter ( 0.018 mv) in the case of my Mobo.  


Set your voltage to 1.34xx        and  thats it  ...boom 130 -135 avg fps if you  OC the ram properly.     yea ...this huge post just to tell u NOT to touch the multiplier ...and  simply set the voltage.  


If you do this  after 3 hours of gaming  the AVERAGE &lt;-  core speed  you will calculate from Hwinfo  across all cores will be  around 4.025 Ghz  with max obviously being 4.1.           The cores will throttle down  to 3.7/3.9 but  80-90% of the time as u monitor the core speeds you'll notice  THEY ALL BOOST to 4.1  non stop so long as you don't  start an AVX or otherwise  super heavy multithread workload (benchmarks , blender , compression tasks etc)   In gaming  the fastest cores  on the system will almost always be  at 4.1ghz.  


Where as Stock , u will notice only 1 or 2 threads will ever boost to 4.1 with the rest at 3.2-3.4   meanwhile  Under ANY LOAD  gaming or otherwise   its very likely  NO thread will boost ...seems as tho at stock as many have voiced concerns over it ""appears"" as if it doesn't boost ....this likely means u have background cpu Usage   of 10% or more ( perfectly reasonable )   but yea garbage vs the 2700x  pbo where it  avg's 3-9  on all cores  while  1-2 boost to 4.3  whilegaming.  


I dunno how the algorithm works , don't really care .. I know these settings work and its the easiest  method by far lol , as   finding the voltage that will actually work on your chip to get a high enough static  all core clock  is by default more steps.   With this you disable to settings  ... and type in two #'s   (once) and u are finished .     Sadly if it matters to you ...multi threaded  performance suffer greatly from this method but again this is to game on.  


If you want max  FPS out of this processor   then I  invite you to  try   BLCK  Overclocking. If the motherboard u have doesn't   allow it...   remember that when you purchase the a new motherboard for  the next gen Ryzen Cpu's ...and never buy that brand again so that its a lesson to them.  As of all functions this is one if not the most powerful for  Overclocking .  While u never hear about it  for more than 2 seconds on Youtube (primarily because they don't have time to  figure  it out per chip/mobo combonation ...time isn't a factor for u as this is gonna be the system you use everyday yea?  


with  Base clock Overclocking , I run my processor at 4.230ghz ....  and it boosts to that on every single thread  80-90% of the time.  for this u must lower soc voltage  fiddle with  the  Ram speed multiplier   so that it isn't some insane # and  Try to stay under 103mhz base clock.   (I suggest  not going over 102.50  personally.  I havn't observed any problems with my M.2 NVME  SSD drive by the way  perhaps  the  caution folks  suggest with those  are limited to  super High BlCK settings or  different brands than the one I own /shrug.  


I ran 4.180mhz for a long time untill I found out thatthe CTDP  setting on my motherboard allowed  the processor to pull sustain a higher frequency load somehow (dont care how)        at 4.180ghz  I was getting  around 4.120  ghz avg core speed per core   after 3 hours of gaming with the  fastest cores   avging 4.162 ghz  and the slowest cores averaging 3980ghz .  
 n thats 144fps  no problem 475-480ish cpuz  single thread score up from 398/400 @ stock or   465-470best all core OC with the ram i have .      Thatsa t 1.32 volts    


currently since playing with chipset voltage  ,  I now run 4.230ish ghz       avg 4186  on fastest cores  4.130 on  weakest cores  . It will throttle to   dogcrap  on multi thread loads but  gaming , single thread crap  it MELTS for the 120  u can get his for currently.    Right now with this setup im like 10-12 pts from 8700k's   single thread scores  which was the king when this  processor came out.  


So yea , ignore youtube  outside of  rough comparisons .      Anyone that tells you not to base clock  OC ...ignore as well they  are probably casuals  that  put 2 fans in their system then complain on Newegg/amazon about  the graphics card they bought  ""running hot"".    As in they  don't know wtf they are talking about , no matter how much   Tech Deals / Linus they  watch.  


Ive topped all the lists for AIO /Air  (the only ones that matter ...do u have a 6ft tall Liquid nitrogen tank and a buddy to apply it to your ""exposed "" setup whil e you game ?    No?  hmm almost like those ""world records ""  and List spots mean absolutely nothing eh?  


This you can do at home  ...cheaply. It should in Theory work on the 2600 non X as well.     When I get the 3600 soon i'll be looking to see how off the youtubers are about it as well. See what  #'s I can hit  and how many frames I can  milk out of it.    


Ps ,  just a word for the wise.  If you build a console ...u are going to  have console results.  
Why don't the esports guys play on Laptops at the  big competitions ?  Could it be...that laptops don't have enough room in them   to facilitate the best hardware ...or  realistically even cool  midrange hardware?  


Yet every youtube guy   always suggests you ""save"" money on power supplies  (get the cheap 500w!   and 40 dollar case !)     


don't waste your time , they are just creating click bate.     Only a moron cheaps out on the case and power supply.  


Why?   Think about it ...the case is the LAST THING u want to upgrade lol.     Full Size cases with Rad support  aren't  the cheapest cases by  default .       Xbox/Playstations are in tiny cases too ...and  Don't  buy all the hype ...mobile hardware is mobile because its not fit to be in a desktop . Get a real  case   , If it can't  hold atleast  8 fans   + a radiator with  2 fans on either side of the rad  ....its  something for your lil sister to facebook on or grandpa to  ""surf the web"" with.    Thats not something you stick 300 dollar  graphics cards in.   Much less  a $400  2060 Super or   5700xt   $500+  2070 super      for those ""ultimate 1000-1500 dollar builds !""       


For a time I had the fastest  1660 TI on the planet . I didn't get some custom water block for it either.  Cheap gigabyte dual fan model.  (my wife uses it now)      But While I couldn't water cool it , I could   make sure it never got over 55 C    (22-24 ambient in my house)  .     My case had multiple Rad support options   , all together it was meant for  10 fans.   Ive got 12 in it.    No fans do not ""cool air""   having more doesn't make it ""colder""   I am not suggesting that.  However the faster you remove heat from the  components ya use ...the more power you can THEN pump into them . Pretty simple.   With  graphics cards obviously  they  have self contained power delivery ,  Their max  power draw has to  run the fans on the card itsefl as wel.  If you   put enough fans into your case ...u  can OC the ballz off the card and never have to turn  its own fans on .   


Gotta cool the ram chips anyway to get  OC's to run stable .  Fans  , Big case ...  Big PSU  with  stupid high rating.  Upgrade everything else  3 or 4 times ... the next case u buy should likely be the last  , as prolly be streaming every game  thru remote servers  in another decade , as server farms spread into more area's. No reason to get some   tinytim console tower or a mid tower to match your  Grannies  Dell either.    


Anyway yea wish I had known about  this  method  a year ago  , but is what it is.  Have fun   144fps  cheap hard to complain.",3,1584351960,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fjif0h/ryzen_2700_actual_overclocking_tips_144fps_high/,Amd,1

I played The Division 2 for 3 hours tonight with a cpu temp monitoring software running in the background and I noticed that my cpu maxed out at 81 C with max CPU speeds in the 3900-4000 Megahertz range. Is this temperature going to harm my CPU if I continue running it at this temperature? I have 2 intake fans, 1 exhaust, and the stock cooler on the cpu. The obvious solution would be to upgrade my cooler but money is a bit tight right now as I'm a college student. I'm aware these CPU Temps aren't ideal by any means, but is it going to kill my CPU if left?",27,1584343289,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fjh00p/is_this_temperature_going_to_harm_my_ryzen_5_2600/,Amd,1

fjge44,Polkfan,3700X Voltage scaling,"In my previous test a few weeks ago i showed that per core Zen 2 on my 3700X at 0.9V 2.25Ghz used 2.48W per core with SMT on and under 2W a core with SMT off. Next step was to see the max frequency that is stable at several voltages and frequency's. It's always interesting to me how efficient a CPU silicon is even on a low binned part such as a 3700X. It would be very interesting to me to compare both a 3800X and 3700X. I suspect even a .1V difference between the two models. For comparisons on my older Ryzen 7 1700 i could run 3.6Ghz with 1.15V all day fully stable in Prime95 and a simple 100mhz increase needed 1.225V and 1.38V for 3.8Ghz obviously hitting a MAJOR voltage wall. These tests down below where run with a constant R20 load and 10GB H.265 AVX encode in the background for 4 hours each.

If I buy a water block I am up to over 600 CAD with everything all together. I think its a pretty good buy considering I will be paying just a little more for a RTX 2070 Super. But what I want to know is if the BIOS in the MECH OC limits its performance because of fan speed and heat temps. Since I am water cooling will I need to use another BIOS or will I be ok with how it is. Any information would help me out a lot.

fjb52d,your_nan,Please help my brothers - Noob questions and upgrade help.,"Hi all, I'll try make this short and snappy. So a three years ago I decided to build a PC and wanted to go with AMD because I didn't like Intel's shady business practices. See build below. I didn't do too much research on my CPU and decided to go with the Ryzen 1600 and 1080ti. During my time gaming, I noticed that I wasn't get the performance I should be and when asking around I was told it was because my CPU was holding my GPU back. 

Now I'm looking to upgrade to a 3700x.

**Questions**

I'm currently using a ASUS STRIX B350-F Gaming AM4 MOBO. I've been told that I have to update my bios with my current 1600 before using my new one? Would it just be better to purchase a new board? I'd rather keep my spending down if needed.

Can I just plug and play and notice obvious performance boosts or will I need to OC?

fj9qx6,johan851,Help choosing a motherboard - my first overhaul in about 10 years,"I'm pretty sure the last AMD CPU I had was a AthlonXP 1500+ on an Abit  NF7-S motherboard.  That was fun.  Now, after a long time on LGA775, it's time to upgrade from my Intel 2500K.  It looks like overclocking isn't quite what it used to be, so I don't feel a need to go all out.

I'm interested in an inexpensive AM4 board to pair with a Ryzen 3600.  All I want is basic support for PBO and **good memory overclocking**.  My only other requirement is SPDIF out, either coax or optical.  

It looks like most of the recommendations for motherboards are centered around strength of the VRMs, but I don't think I need much in terms of power delivery given I'm getting a 3600 and don't plan to do aggressive all-core overclocking.

Looking around at recommendations I've gathered...

 \- MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon - slow POST issues, and possibly at end of support?  
 \- MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX - no SPDIF  
 \- ASRock B450(M) Steel Legend - memory voltage limited to 1.4v  
 \- ASUS ROG Strix B450-F Gaming - VRMs have inadequate cooling (unsure if this matters as much for a Ryzen 3600)

mATX format is fine, I only need one GPU and one M2 SSD.  I'd like to keep it sub-$150, and X470 prices are dropping, so maybe that's an option?  I'm finding plenty of information on VRM capability, but very little on good support for memory overclocking.

Maybe the MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon issues I'm reading about here and there aren't very common?",15,1584310933,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fj9qx6/help_choosing_a_motherboard_my_first_overhaul_in/,Amd,1

I have to admit: I know very little about OC and tweaking voltages in the BIOS. But I tried different voltage settings and I'm quite surprised by the results I got.

My build:

\- Motherboard: Asus ROG CROSSHAIR VIII HERO

\- RAM: Trident Z Neo 3600Mhz (DOCP standard profile)

\- CPU: Ryzen 9 3900x

\- GPU: RTX 2080 Super (EVGA FTW3 Ultra Gaming)

All my tests were made with 1 pass of Cinebench r20, I only changed the CPU core voltage (everything else to auto):

\- Everything to auto (1.47V): 6776 pts.

\- 1.25V: 6558 pts

\- 1.225V (which seems to be my sweet spot at stock): 7117pts

So precision boost overdrive and auto OC gives me basically no improvement over stock when enabled, not sure if it's a motheboard bug (MSI MPG X570) but either way I wont be using them anymore.

For the past two months I have been using a (pretty) stable all core 4.4GHz OC at 1.3 volts which from what I have heard is the upper end of the safe all core voltage for zen2. (especially considering PBO and AOC would do an all core 1.38 and only be pushing 3.9GHz)

My cinebench score stock is 6670, and now it is 7780. I dont mind the 84C since it only gets there under full synthetic load and most things I do dont get it up past 77.

I guess the point of this post is to ask what you all think about doing a manual OC/is it good/does anything look unsafe.

fj6aid,acultabovetherest,From 4c4t intel to 12c24t AMD. I call her ereshkigal.,"To check out the new build and my messy ass desk area go to this link: [photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/mlAq6Ik)

So anyway hey everyone this is my first real post since my last attempt was on a weekday (sorry mods!) but I found myself really needing a new PC.

I was coming from a build I had from 2013, it was:

Intel 4670k overclocked a bit. 4c4t.
AsRock board
16gb of DDR3 ram.
GTX 970
And a really bad psu(one of the cheap cyberpowerpc ones)

It was honestly amazing my house hasn’t burned down yet. I didn’t know a super ton about PCs even though I was knowledgeable on most things. PSU is one area I was lacking in.

This time wanted to build my own system so I started looking around for what intel had to offer, the most I could afford there at the time was an i9 with 10c20t. But at 800$ it was a real yikes. 

In comes glorious AMD to save the day and they drop ryzen 3000 series. Check out the competition (this is my first AMD build) and find out that hey they actually kick ass. So with 2000$ as my budget I put this together. A lot of deals I got on or around Black Friday to make the price work.

I wanted a lot of cores and pcie gen 4 so I could benefit when I edit 4K video with my scratch drive.

RogStrix 570-E board.
AMD Ryzen 3900x 12c24t
Corsair H100i LE in white.
G.Skill Royal 3200MHz in silver, 32GB.
RTX 2080Super from Gigabyte.
Corsair 1tb NVME pcie4 drive.
4tb Seagate IronWolf drive.
Corsair RM850 PSU (finally got a decent psu boiz)
Plus transferred and wiped some SSD’s from my other pc.

I picked out a random case that I liked the look of and had everything I needed for it.

Put it together and I installed windows and everything was fine, put it away to wait for my 4tb drive, a week later went to instal the drive and it wouldn’t even post. I literally was super careful and all I did was use the plug I had already put in last week and connect the drive and some how it killed my mother board.

I tried a lot of shit to get it working but no matter what I did it just would not post at all. No code nothing. So I took everything apart and got the motherboard replaced put it all together again and success we were golden.

But yeah for my first build it was hectic and a lot of those connectors are so small and hard to get to but I kept going and it’s been zooming steady for the past few months. So if I can do it anyone of you can to.

This computer literally eats everything I throw at it. It’s a beast. It does nothing badly. 4K gaming, 1440p high refresh rate, streaming, video editing. It’s my dream build for me personally.

And ryzen is so good I went ahead and got a ryzen 3700u laptop that was on sale at Microsoft for 400$ and I use it to either stream to my main rig or use it on the go.

But yeah thanks for checking it out!",7,1584298251,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fj6aid/from_4c4t_intel_to_12c24t_amd_i_call_her/,Amd,1

I've crashed in all these games, and some times I've gotten BSOD. I provided some screenshots of these crashes.

I believe maybe the Motherboard might not be compatible with everything else, since I've upgraded just about everything of this system besides the motherboard. Could this be it??

fj0t54,RabidNinja64,Doing my first ever Overclock - R5 1600 to 4ghz on stock cooler?,"Hey folks! I felt like i've been cradling my 1600 at stock ever since i bought it 4 years ago, and to tell the truth, I was always dissuaded by the myths of overclocking, how it can shorten your processors lifespan, increase heat, damage part X,Y,Z; basically all the naysayers input (and probably intel fanboys), but it all gave me the general ""I like my CPU, I dont want to break it"" mentality.

So, being rather attached to my build and the lengthy bouts of gaming i plan on doing, I've resorted to saying ""feck it"" and going about testing my CPU after 4 years of being relatively cool, in comparison to the hell im going to put it through, come the 20th (if you know, you know), And an AMD subthread, I'd like everyones input and see if i can keep this badboy relatively cool on the way to 4ghz!

So, specs!

* R5 1600 AE model **WITH STOCK WRAITH SPIRE COOLER**
* Asus ROG STRIX B350-f motherboard (bios dated to 26/04/2019, will update if needed)
* Corsair vengeance RGB PRO 16gb running stock 3200mhz
* Sapphire Nitro+ RX 480 4GB (OC'd to 1306 clock speed w/ 1750 vRAM speed and custom fan curve)

The stress test applications I am currently using will be Cinebench, Aida64 and Prime95. Sessions will be held for 30 minutes at a time, Heats and voltages will be recorded, and if necessary, undervolted where applicable.

Currently, here are my results;

**TEST 1** \- 3.6 @ 1.35v - SUCCESS

**TEST 2** \- 3.7 @ 1.35v - SUCCESS @  63c - 2311cbScore

(PRIME95 INTRODUCED) **CURRENT TEST 3** \- 3.8 @ 1.35v - SUCCESS @ 72c-77c under load - 2601 cbScore - Voltages spiking to 1.373.

**Currently planned test overclocks will include;**

TEST 4 - 3.8 @ 1.33v   
TEST 5 - 4.0 @ 1.36v  
TEST 6 - 4.0 @ 1.33v

I had 2666mhz ram 2x4gb (8gb total) and wanted to upgrade to 16gb, the exact same kit wasn't available so I decided to get a faster one cause it was only a bit more expensive. When I changed the kits the pc booted, but only showed 1333mhz in taskmanager (so 2666mhz if im not mistaken). 

After turning on XMP in BIOS my pc didn't boot up and I had to take out the cmos thing.

I saw a benchmark of R5 1400 running 3200mhz so my 1500x should too.

I've been running it at 2666mhz for a good year now cause I didn't want to deal with it, but since I'm planning on upgrading next year, might as well get the most out of it.

Any ideas on how to make it work in 3200mhz?",0,1584262591,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fiyi6s/pc_doesnt_boot_with_xmp/,Amd,1

fixp7i,JohanAke,MSI Tomahawk MAX or x470 Gaming Plus MAX,"Hi,

I'm in a market for a new pc parts and have settled for AMD Ryzen 3600, 16GB 3200mhz ram and Tomahawk MAX motherboard. This seems like a good combo for me. I already have Vega 56 reference GPU.

But now I happened to notice that there is still ongoing cashback from MSI for mb + cpu combos. So it would be cheaper for me to buy Ryzen 3600 + x470 Gaming Plus motherboard. But I do not have a much knowledge of motherboards.

So would it be a better to buy x470 Gaming Plus since it is now cheaper than the b450 Tomahawk MAX?",13,1584257216,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fixp7i/msi_tomahawk_max_or_x470_gaming_plus_max/,Amd,1

fix1yy,Marcosgmunoz,Is the i5 9600KF OC better than Ryzen 5 3600 OC for gaming while streaming?,"quick reminder if you're not aware of its existence, the KF is just the K with no integrated graphics.

So I'm aware of the differences between the two, i5 better single-core, 3600 better multicore, hyperthreading, a lil more future-proof if you like the term, cheaper, all that. Stock speeds, I'd go with the Ryzen.

Here's the dillemma though, the i5 seems to be designed to be overclocked, whereas the Ryzen doesn't take it very well in games (please do tell me if I'm getting something wrong). Is the performance pushed out of an overclocked i5 9600KF worth the extra 35$(which is not a big deal to me)? Or will the multi-core performance make more of a difference with the multitasking involved in streaming? I really don't know what to expect.

BTW I'm mostly worried about streaming EFT, where frames are gold.

fivpgt,hiisukun,I'd expect your 4X00U/H laptops to be delayed (based on Dell XPS),"If you're like me, considering a 4X00U or similar laptop when they come out 'nowish', I think it's fair to consider them moderately delayed. 

My reasoning is that the lead of Project Sputnik (the Dell XPS that comes with Ubuntu), Barton George, posted on twitter \[1\] that their new model, due in February but announced at the start of Jan 2020, is undergoing delays due to supply chain / COVID-19 impacts. This seems entirely reasonable and perhaps obvious, but the large brands don't seem to be announcing anything yet. 

Maybe it hurts consumer confidence or is simply not good marketing to speak about the global pandemic impacting your company products/deliveries, who knows, but I reckon it's unlikely that Dell would be impacted by this and not also Lenovo, Asus, LG, whomever else, etc.  

Anyway, performance seems like it will be great, including battery life, and the COVID-19 pandemic is a pretty real thing impacting people everywhere, so try and be zen (hah!) about your laptop being delayed. There are important things going on.

So I built my first PC in December and have had my GPU on the silent bios ever since then. To be honest I didn’t even really think about the OC bios because I’m definitely not super knowledgeable when it comes to PCs!

I use the PC for gaming and general web browsing, so nothing too fancy!

I also read that people have had issues in the last couple of days when they swapped from silent to oc, so maybe it would be better to wait if I should change?

I started on 19.12.3 I think, and that went smooth enough, but one decent-sized issue; if I used the hotkeys to open up Radeon and exited the software, my alt key would get stuck 100% of the time.

Yes, this is a rather long rant about one small thing and one major thing that happened once, but it is still an issue.

Stuck in endless boot cycle ending on ""b2"" postcode without ever even managing to send a signal to display.","My X570 Master is paired with a 3800X. I have had several issues with BIOS settings being lost after shutdown prior to this, but now, I can't even get to the BIOS anymore following a Win10 shutdown. It instead power cycles itself continually until it reaches the ""b2"" error, at which point it freezes for 10-20 seconds before power cycling again.

My 3800X is running stock settings.

I am running this RAM kit at its stock XMP settings: F4-3200C14D-32GVK.

I am running a Powercolor 5700 Red Dragon, also fully stock.

All my display drivers are up-to-date and my motherboard is running the F11 BIOS.

The following things have not worked:

Making absolute sure my display cable is connected and working

Clearing CMOS

Reseating RAM

Swapping the RAM into the A1 B1 slots

Swapping the RAM into A1 A2 or B1 B2

Running just a single stick of RAM (tried both sticks alone in all four slots)

Switching GPU BIOS

Reseating GPU

Putting GPU into a lower PCIe slot

My GPU fans aren't spinning but they never are during boot. I am still pretty sure my GPU works as the backplate got warm in both the PCIe slots I tested it in.

I have also tried just letting it power cycle for around 30 minutes to no avail. Never got any sign of life on my display.

I'm out of ideas for what to tweak at this point. Is this a motherboard issue, or has my CPU / GPU / RAM up and died?

Also, can someone explain to me how I'm able to capture a 30 second replay even though I'm not personally recording my gameplay?

fispkv,NaylaMayte,Experience with RX 5700 XT," I recently built my first gaming PC with an Gigabyte RX 5700 XT OC.

Like most i immediately noticed some issues with black screens.

Driver update 20.2.2 seemed to fix these issues, however after a windows update the issue quickly returned.

Here what i've done to fix 99% of my issues with black screens and crashes:

Reinstalled windows 10 (This is with a version of windows from late December.)  
Immediately turned off windows updates.  
Booted into Safemode and uninstalled the drivers installed by windows with DDU.  
Updated AMD Chipset BIOS.  
Install 20.2.2 driver direct from AMD website.

This fixed most of my issues but was still getting occasional crashes and flicking.  
Turns out MSI Afterburner caused the flickering,so if you want to OC/undervolt/check temps use the built in option in the Radeon drivers section.

The final fix for games like Apex and Call of Duty was to add this into the registry:

*Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers\] ""TdrDelay""=hex(b):08,00,00,00,00,00,00,00*

\*\* Please note this is for x64 windows 10 NOT x32

fisnjq,TheDarkSwordsman,Overclocking 3950X with SMT Off. Currently at 4.35 Ghz all core. Can I go higher?,"Hi everyone, I hope this is allowed. Doesn't seem to break the rules AFAIK.

I made a comment on a post talking about my temps in an mATX case with an NZXT X52 240mm rad, saying I don't really hit over 75C. I mentioned that I was running 1.375V.

Someone replied and suggested I fix my overclock (since I only did a basic one in Ryzen Master). They linked [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/f18cbc/reviewing_voltage_recommendations_for_zen_2/) detailing the previous ""1.325V limit"" and how it's likely best to keep it under 1.275V or so.

I eventually disabled my RM OC and went into the BIOS. I got a base setup and went with 4.1 Ghz. Once I did that, I use the Ryzen DRAM Calculator to finally get my (obviously not b-die) Corsair Vengeance LPX 3000 Mhz CL15 ram to go below CL16. I was able to actually overclock it to CL14 (you can see all the details in my screenshot with Ryzen Master).

Someone also recommended the HCI Memtest. I ram 8 instances (since it said to run 2.0-3.5GB each and fill most of the ram). Here's the details on that: https://i.imgur.com/tMrysTt.png

I found it odd that only one of the instances found 4 errors, so maybe it was a bug, or the instances interfering with eachother? Either way, I thought it was good.

I finally finished and got to a stopping point. [This](https://imgur.com/a/a5Tsn8X) is where I sit during an R20 run. My last bench I got 7409.

- 4.350 Ghz All Core
- ASRock X570M Pro4
- CPU LLC1
- SOC LLC2
- CPU VID 1.28125V
- SOC 1.06V (reads 1.056 on LLC2, 1.050 on LLC3) 
- SMT and PBO Off
- Max 69ºC

The user also suggested testing Prime95, which I am familiar with but haven't touched since I was hitting 108C on my old OC and the system would shut off. I never had this happen with Intel CPUs (3570K, 2600K) so I thought it was a bug.

Max P95 Small FFT temp was 96C. I know that's hot, but Cinebench is the hottest thing besides P95. It never hits those temps normally.

One thing I did notice is that 3 or 4 total cores were actually underclocking to 500-1200 Mhz while running P95 on CCX 1-0 and 1-1 (2 cores each, C09, C12, C13, and C16). 

Previously when I was using 1.375V and no other settings, I was able to to 4275 Mhz on CCXs 0-0, 1-0, and 1-1. CCX 0-1 was at 4425 Mhz, however, I am unsure how to do this in BIOS. 

I am worried that using Ryzen Master would override a bunch of settings, unless it won't? They did suggest that one CCX could slow down the others, so getting individual CCXs to OC higher would be a benefit. 

I did try 4.4 Ghz, but I think I need to increase the VID some more which I would prefer not to do. I also read that a lot of people actually run LLC5 which *apparently* improves lifespan (which the link earlier disagrees with in many places).

Should I stop here, try to do individual CCXs, or push the VCore higher? 

Oh, and by the way. I noticed that the actual core voltages would sit around 1.275V while idling, but then go down to 1.200V to 1.206V. Is that normal? https://i.imgur.com/5UGivhY.png",11,1584232276,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fisnjq/overclocking_3950x_with_smt_off_currently_at_435/,Amd,1

I can also keep it at 1.00v exactly, stable, if I max out the peak speed at about 1.7-1.8ghz and disable mirroring core speeds. My cpu temps are still about 39c with a Wraith Spire cooler (the tiny one the 1600 comes with) at 10-20% cpu usage and 50-60% max frequency.

firj1v,Bernaldinho9,Powercolor Red Devil RX 5700XT OC bios mode issues,"Recently I purchased a Powercolor Red Devil RX 5700XT, and for the first couple of days I had the card installed in the ""Silent mode"" setting that the card offers via a physical switch on the card itself. I was getting pretty satisfactory performance, but out of curiosity I wanted to try the ""OC mode"". After changing the switch and reinstalling the card using DDU, the first thing I noticed was that the audio coming from my PC would constantly pop and crackle. At first I thought it was my speakers, but I tried a different device with no audio issues whatsoever. Next, the display would frequently flicker, and even YouTube videos would refuse to load. There were was also constant freezes and crashes in this mode. I tried changing the PCIE settings in the bios to see if that would solve anything but no luck. Does anyone know any work arounds with this issue, or should I just reinstall the card again and keep in Silent mode?  


Update: As of now, even with reinstalling the card back to ""Silent mode"" I'm getting the same audio and visual issues that I had in the OC mode, which did not exist prior to when I switched just yesterday. Yesterday I used my PC for a couple hours without any issues whatsoever. Now, the moment I launch, I face issues on startup. I'm currently reinstalling windows to see if that fixes anything.  


Update 2: After completely reinstalling Windows, the problems seem to have ceased. No flickering or freezing immediately on startup and the audio is back to normal. Now the question is, is it worth trying to set the bios switch back to ""OC mode"" again, but maybe needing to freshly re-install Windows once again.",0,1584227680,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/firj1v/powercolor_red_devil_rx_5700xt_oc_bios_mode_issues/,Amd,1

fios3m,PM_Me_Your_FACS_Plot,Amazon appears to be selling damaged 3900x CPU's as new," [https://imgur.com/gallery/rYONHRX](https://imgur.com/gallery/rYONHRX) 

So, on Monday 3/9, I purchased  a new 3900x CPU for a new build from Amazon.  This particular CPU was sold and fulfilled by Amazon, not a third party.  It was on backorder with an ""available to ship date"" of 3/13.  No biggie - I wouldn't have all my components delivered until then anyway. To my surprise, I received a package on Thursday, 3/12 containing the CPU.  I set it aside and waited for a couple of other components before opening.  

Yesterday, 3/13, I opened the package.  The CPU box was in an odd plastic bag with green printing and a couple of barcodes on the outside.   I thought this was odd, but did not think twice as the bag was sealed.  This bag is visible in my box picture in the imgur album.  I regret that I did not pay close attention to the bag, but I was excited to get started piecing together components.  The CPU box also had a dent in the top, though there was no visible shipping damage  to the Amazon box.  There were no factory seals on the CPU box, and the top simply lifted off, which should have been another red flag.  However, in my excitement, I ignored it.

I removed the PCU from the protective plastic case.  There were no fingerprints or thermal compound on the CPU.  I flipped it over to look at the pins to realize that MANY pins were bent, some badly, almost as though it had been dropped multiple times or forced into a socket.   All pins on the corners were bent, and one side had \~10 bent pins.  It definitely was not going to fit into the socket.  I briefly considered bending pins back, but decided that I would rather go through support to get a replacement, as I did not want to risk breaking pins myself.  Amazon support suggested that I contact AMD for warranty support.  I called, but got their out of office reply.

I then did several searches online and realized that similar things had happened to others in the past with Amazon orders, though it appeared to be a rare occurrence judging by the mostly very positive Amazon reviews.  I also realized several important things were not right about my CPU when I compared back to photo reviews from Amazon.

1. The weird bag
2. No factory seals
3. The plastic sleeve containing the CPU normally contains a little AMD logo sticker or piece of paper.  This was missing from my sleeve (not pictured).

I immediately said ""fuck this"" and RMA'd back to Amazon.  I am waiting on a replacement and hopefully it will be a genuine, new, CPU.  I will update this post after I receive it.  Looking back, I believe that Amazon had 3900x's on backorder, received a return, processed it, and sent it to me as new without checking for damage.  It is super surprising to me that this happened - though searching through forum posts and reddit unveiled a couple of other similar posts, mostly &gt;1yr ago.  Anyway, buyer beware and yada yada yada.  Here's hoping that this post might help people to make an informed decision of where they decide to source components from in the future.",53,1584217097,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fios3m/amazon_appears_to_be_selling_damaged_3900x_cpus/,Amd,1
fiooxy,WuXeS,Ryzen: how to get adaptive voltage when OCing,"Hi, pretty much the title. I've built 2 PCs with Ryzen 5 1600 AFs and they're great, but I don't understand their voltage behaviour.

The mobo is MSI B450M PRO-VDH MAX. I gave the CPU a multiplier overclock to 3.8 on auto voltage, which results in 1.31V. Thing is, it's 1.31V fixed, all the time, no matter what. There's no option for ""adaptive"" voltage in bios like on my 9900K machine, only ""fixed"" and ""offset"". Is this really how this Ryzen CPU has to behave? Is there a way to set it so that it can drop voltage as needed?",15,1584216765,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fiooxy/ryzen_how_to_get_adaptive_voltage_when_ocing/,Amd,1

finktl,nokkynuk,First AMD build since Windsor (2007) - Back on team red! - Budget Build - R7 2700 (non-x),"*\[First time/long time lurker\]*

I've been an Intel user since 2008, and my last AMD build was during the Athlon Windsor days. I already owned the RTX 2070 and 860 EVO. 

I wanted to go budget, and give my wife my old 3770K with a GTX 1070 a friend provided me.

The case is hot garbage. Wiring a full size ATX board is near impossible if you have big hands/fat fingers like me. Not to mention you have to wire the PSU **prior** to putting the motherboard in or you have start over. Obviously the cooling offered by the case is nil, but i got the Deepcool cpu cooler to use instead of the Wraith Spire LED *(Anyone in the Houston Area want to buy/take off my hands?)*

I tried many things to fix it but nothing worked so I even did a clean install but the issues still persisted. I read something where someone set their PCIe to gen 3 instead of gen 4 to fix some issues so I tried that and it started working just fine as soon as I rebooted. Is this a known issue?

fik3at,HecatoncheirWoW,3700x / 2080 Super Lags/Microstutters In All Games,"Hello,  
I recently build my first desktop PC after a long period of laptop usage (4-5 years) and in this build, I decided to go with new Ryzen 3000 series instead of Intel. But I have a few problems.  
First of all, I have bad microstutters / mini freezes across all games. In BF5, it is the worst but in games like Witcher 3 , WoW, Dota 2, I can see them too. And the weird thing is when those microstutters occur, both GPU-CPU usage or **only CPU** usage makes dips and backs up. 

In **BFV**, I monitored the situation with ingame frametime ms graph and saw that when these stutters and usage drops occurs, GPU ms is between 8-14 ms but CPU ms jumps to 30-40 sometimes 70-80 ms in DX11.  
 In DX12, things are way worst for CPU, gpu is between 6-11ms all the time with **NO SPIKES,** but CPU jumps to 30-40 or 70-80 as like in DX11.  


In **Witcher 3,** when the stutters/freezes occured, GPU usage and clocks staying same with no spikes, but CPU Clocks are very weird. I will attach the graph from MSI Afterburner in Witcher 3, temps are from 42 to 58 celcius range, no thermal throttle, but clocks are jump and forth from 4.2-4.3 to 3.5-3.6 in stutter times. Below is the graph of Witcher 3, there were 3 major stutters and both can be seen on graph.

Things I have tried:  
1) Changing PSU (from TX850M to RM750), no difference  
2) DDU graphic drivers and install different drivers (from 441.xx to 442.59)  
3) Download and install / reinstall the latest chipset drivers from AMD website.  
4) Using both Ryzen High Performance / Balanced power plans.  
5) BIOS is already at latest version (Tuf Gaming Plus X570 - Bios 1405 ), no OC, only XMP enabled.Rams are 2x8 GB GSkill Trident Z Neo 3600CL16  
6) Using Project Lasso to enable/disable SMT, priority set to High, CPU 0  enabled/disabled.  
7) ISLC (Intelligent Standby Memory Cleaner) is always enabled.  
8) Nvidia Control Panel = Maximum Performance, Pre-Rendered Frames to 1. No change at all :(  
9) Windows 1903 -1909 doesn't make difference, both same.   
10) In Cinebench R20, Single core is 506 with 4.392 maximum - 4382 effective maximum, multicore 4754 with **3.96 all core** on **default**.(Seems a bit low to me)",0,1584199813,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fik3at/3700x_2080_super_lagsmicrostutters_in_all_games/,Amd,1

Why neither from display settings in Windows nor in the game options in COD, I don't have a 2560x1440 option? For example I have 1080p or 1200p, and I can put 1080p and set the Ratio to 16:9, and I will have blackbars, but why I cannot do the same with 1440p?

What I can do is keep COD in 3440x1440 and set Aspect Ratio to 16:9, now I will have black bars on the side, but something is wrong with the game then, the FPS are always around 120, but there are huge frame drops every 20-30sec.

fij1mm,Fladelaide,Strange performance discrepancies with 4K external monitor,"I have an ASUS TUF Gaming FX705DT laptop (AMD processor) and recently hooked up a SAMSUNG LU28E590DS 4K monitor (it has AMD components, so I figured it would work well).

This is where it gets odd:

* If I connect my laptop to HDMI port 1, it gives me horrendous performance. On its own, the laptop itself runs most applications OK at 1080p, but with the monitor connected, I had to put it to 720p to do anything.
* BUT if I use HDMI port 2, my laptop's performance speed practically doubles. I can run games at 4K with over 100fps  and general usage is very smooth.

There are two things that I don't get here. 1) How does connecting an external monitor actually increase my core processing speed? 2) Why is the performance with HMDI port 1 so much slower than HMDI 2?",0,1584195576,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fij1mm/strange_performance_discrepancies_with_4k/,Amd,1

fihyq0,xAleksas,Building AMD pc was my biggest mistake ever.,"Two months ago I decided to move on from console gaming (Xbox One X) to PC gaming. 
I've been playing on consoles since 2015 and havn't touched a PC since then, before that I had a very low time end pc that I used to play league of legends only.
However time was passing and my patience was running out, I couldn't stand 30fps and 800p graphics no more, so I decided it was a time to build a pc.

I was thinking of doing it for long time tbh, but was scared of having to keep my eyes on fps more than the actual game, keeping drivers up to date and dealing with various issues compared to console 1 click play.
And AMD gave me all of those issues. I have R7 3700x, 5700XT, B450, 16GB DDR4, 1080p freesync monitor my games looks and runs terrible, so called 1440p king can't even run call of duty modern warfare at high settings without micro stuttering, drivers are a hot mess, every day I get atleast 1 black screen.
Every single game needs vsync on because so glorified freesync doesn't do shit. 

This has to be my worst decision and I regret buying AMD products. I know I'll get downvoted to oblivion since this is AMD reddit but fuck this, having these issues after like what? 7 months? Is unacceptable.",48,1584190699,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fihyq0/building_amd_pc_was_my_biggest_mistake_ever/,Amd,1
fihsxc,Fresh_Repeat,Is this config good(...ish)?,"Hi, I want to upgrade my PC, due to some problem which results in very high temperatures and very low GPU Usage. I don't know what the issue comes from, I just know it's not the GPU itself, as this is issue is present only on my PC.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm trying to make something that doesnt bottleneck/get bottlenecked by the GTX 1060 3GB I have, but also something that gives me some room for upgrade in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

For a CPU, I'm going to look at the Ryzen 5 2600. Yes, this will get bottlenecked by the GTX 1060, but at the moment, it seems as if it's better to buy a CPU that would be bottlenecked, rather than buy a CPU that costs 10-15 dollars that wouldn't get bottlenecked (the 1600).

&amp;#x200B;

For a MotherBoard, I'm looking at the ASUS ROG STRIX B450-F.

&amp;#x200B;

For RAM, I'm going to go for the G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 2x8 GB. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the PSU, I'm going for the EVGA 600 BR 100-BR-0600-K1 600w PSU, as I do not have a massive budget, and actually, my budget at first was taken up completely by the motherboard and the CPU.

&amp;#x200B;

For the case, I'll just buy something cheap with enough space and 2 or 3 places for a fan. I might buy an RGB one, or just a normal one, it depends.

&amp;#x200B;

For the SSD, I'll continue looking. I will buy a 500 GB SSD for both the system (win 10) and the heavy games. I'll buy a 1 TB HDD, too, because the one I am currently using is pretty old and I feel like it could start clicking at any moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a good enough configuration? I also feel the need to apologize for my bad english. Have a good day, Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted AMD support and they replied quickly telling me to contact Xbox support with the issue. So I did.

They kept asking me for  photos of both sides of the prepaid card. I told them taht I don1t have one, because it's digital. This went on for like two weeks.

fiho5x,PimpHomicide,Two questions about my new 3700X on X370,"I finally upgraded my 1700 to a 3700X today. I have two questions regarding memory speed and cpu temperature. My specs are:  
X370 Taichi ([cpu-z img](https://imgur.com/a/R7Rtjcq)) with the 5.60 bios  
3700X with a Noctua NH-D15  
G.Skill 16 GB DDR4-3600 kit (F4-3600C16D-16GTZR, [cpu-z memory img](https://imgur.com/a/TbvFCnM))  
NVME 970 Evo bootdrive  
MSI 2070 Super Gaming X

Two questions:

1) I ran my 1700 overclocked (using p-states) and it ran way cooler than my 3700X on idle.. Is that normal? I got my fans on a silent profile, the same profile I was using for me 1700. [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/8m9S0OW) for a HWmonitor screenshot on idle. I'm positive I put on the cooler correctly. On idle the temp jumps from 34 to 45C.  
2) I bought the memory kit a while back when still using my 1700. I already knew I wouldn't be able to reach 3600mhz with my 1700, but I figured with a 3700X it would be fine. Unfortunately I can't get it to run above 3200. I only tried setting the XMP profile in the bios and then setting the speed. I tried 3600 and 3400 which both failed, 3200 seems to run okay so far. Should I try playing with ryzen master instead? It annoys me though that you need to set it to start with windows to get your config to apply, but if people have more success with it I guess I can give it a go. I'm a bit pissed off that after all these years there are still problems with memory compatibility :-(

Hard restarting or turning off and on again normally, got me on that infinite loop, so I turned off my PSU completely because I didn't felt like taking ram sticks out and in again, I let it rest and when I went to turn back on again, it booted normally.

Immediately, I remembered that they were some issues I had in Ubuntu 2 years ago. I followed the instructions from  [https://github.com/suaefar/ryzen-test](https://github.com/suaefar/ryzen-test) and boom after 10 mins of downloading ubuntu 17.04 running it with an usb on my machine I had the proof I needed to send my CPU to AMD. I filled in the warranty request form  [https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/warranty-information/rma-form](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/warranty-information/rma-form) . They answered back the other day and told me to check my address info. I confirmed and they sent the DHL label, receipt and everything I needed to send the CPU.

I waited over the weekend and gave the CPU to DHL Monday morning at 8am. The CPU arrived in Amsterdam the next day at 2pm and was checked by 4pm and confirmation that I would be provided with a new CPU was sent. The CPU departed from the Netherlands, but I had no shipping info, so I contacted AMD through the email in which I confirmed my address. They answer quickly with the tracking number. So Thursday it was and DHL made a mistake and sent the CPU to the wrong facility, so that it had to be transferred from Italy to Germany first than sent to Austria and after all that to me.

But OK, the CPU arrived yesterday in the afternoon (Friday) I started it up and first thing OFC overclock it. The old CPU was a dog with max overclock of 3.85GHz, 3.875GHz would crash the poor chip. I loaded the profile I had for the previous CPU and guess what 1.55GHz. After a quick BIOS update and some playing around I got to 3.8GHz with ease.

Yeah, I had to overclock some more and now I'm at 4.0GHz  @ 1.35V stable. Very happy with how it all worked out, thanks to you guy, we are a great community and thanks to AMD!",26,1584182760,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/figi11/thanks_reddit_thanks_amd/,Amd,1

fiemca,MeatyPotatoMilk,5700xt issues,"I recently bought the red devil 5700xt and was experiencing crashes. I searched Reddit and other various forums and all seemed to point the finger at AMD drivers. The scary part is most of these posts were in September 2019 which leads me to believe they still haven't found a fix. Well, if wanted, newegg offered my money back in the form of newegg credit but im not sure if I should just stick it out or not. I've lately been wanting to upgrade to 1440p 144hz gaming and the 5700xt seemed liked the perfect card to achieve that goal, So basically my question is, should I return the card and get an nvidia(best one for 1440p 144hz seems to be the 2080ti at $1200) or should I try to wait for AMD to get it together and keep the 5700xt?",51,1584169891,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fiemca/5700xt_issues/,Amd,1

I’m exhausted. I’ve spent the last 8 HOURS working shit over because of this fucking card. I love the look and the feel of the Red Devil card but holy fucking shit I haven’t even gotten to use it. The first attempt to install drivers caused my computer to crash mid install with BSOD. Within a few minutes it would then do it again after forcing itself to restart. So safe mode and remove. Install newer drivers (the first set was the first link google gave me). They install. Yay. Crash instantly after finish. So ok fuck this, I start googling. The only report other than the newest drivers of fixing this issue I found was to reset windows. Well fuck it it’s only a 500 gig hard drive. I’ll go for it. Then it fails after 99% reset. So I tried resetting again. This time it fails mid reset and corrupts the files. Now I can’t boot into anything. So I then spent 2 hours formatting the ENTIRE hard drive back to normal. I then freshly installed Windows. I updated everything. Installed the drivers as the very first thing. It worked! So I gave it a few minutes. Everything’s fine. I go to redownload steam. Reboot. 

What the fuck do I do or do I just give up? Will a different card help? Or are the drivers genuinely this bad? It’s 2:30 am. I just wanna get an answer to this and finish it up for the night.

fib5ww,Lemons81,Question about XMP / Asrock B450M Steel Legend,"I have a Ryzen 2600x installed, ever since i completed this build

i had trouble getting memory working at decent speed, because XMP was just not working at all, if i enabled it or not it would always use the memory at 1333Mhz.

I did upgrade the UEFI BIOS in steps, then tried each step/version again to enable it.

Even memory on Asrock's QLV list that had support for XMP wasn't working like promised.

So eventually after buying 5 different memory modules from the QLV list i gave up.

And settled with : Crucial Ballistix Sport LT 3200 MHz DDR4 DRAM Desktop Gaming Memory Kit 16GB (8GBx2) CL16

Those wherent even on the QLV list but at least ran at 2400Mhz instead at 1333Mhz.

And no matter what settings i changed in the BIOS, there was never an error, the system always booted correctly but never implemented the changed like the BIOS was just ignoring everything i changed.

Since i have a dual boot system, this was the same for Linux as Windows. 

I guess i left XMP on 3200Mhz witch totally wrong CAS settings since it was never taken any effect i left it like this and settled for 2400Mhz.

Now today suddenly i got random black screens, then the case fans and water cooler fans started ramping up to maximum, strange i tought and decided to boot into the BIOS since it keeps a log of error codes i wanted to check if i could find something there.

Strangely enough, at boot suddenly i saw my memory clocked at 3200Mhz instead of 2400Mhz.

Now just like this out of the blue my stupid motherboard decided to accept the XMP settings, with the wrong CAS settings, so i set it to automatic and now my system is running at 3200Mhz stable.

I haven't updated windows, AMD software or anything... just like that my motherboard decided to use XMP settings now after 4 months completing this build.

fi7ikt,Exodus_Black_,FPS problems on Cod: Warzone,"Hello AMD subreddit, I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post about performance issues I'm having but I've tried to look for others with this issue and I just can't seem to find it.

I've been playing the new COD: Warzone gamemode and have been enjoying it a lot, my problem is the game refuses to use my graphics card when I play on 'Fullscreen Borderless' and 'Fullscreen Extended Window' I would get about 30-60FPS. However if I run the game in normal 'Fullscreen' or even run it in 'Windowed' the game worst perfectly fine and I get smooth 100+ FPS with nearly 0% stuttering.

I'm running a RX580 which should be more than enough to run the game, and even then it does not make sense to me why I can run perfectly smooth on 'Windowed' but I struggle to get 60fps on 'Fullscreen Borderless'. It really isn't a huge problem as it only takes me 3-4 more seconds when I alt-tab playing on normal fullscreen but I'm just curious as to why? If anyone shares this problem or knows a fix I'd be happy to hear.

TLDR: Game refuses to use my graphics card if I play on Fullscreen Borderless and utilization drops to 0% consistently then back to normal but playing on Fullscreen or even Windowed works like a charm.",0,1584136167,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fi7ikt/fps_problems_on_cod_warzone/,Amd,1

When I tried to add an issue not yet listed here AMD removed it citing it was offtopic. I explained that this was a rollup thread and that I was simply adding this issue to it as most people wont know about this and needed to where that was also removed. Since them i'm told by other people that this is also happening. This isn't good at all, who on earth is allowing this to happen, this will only blow up in the faces of AMD.

Here are some initial comments on how [Rosetta@home](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2020/02/rosettas-role-in-fighting-coronavirus/) and [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/2020/02/27/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov/) are helping to understand and combat SARS-CoV-2.

Distributed computing is a simple concept - an institution takes a large chunk of data and breaks it up into small pieces. The data is sent out to anyone who is a member of that research team, your computer does the number crunching, and the finished product is sent back to the institution to be added to the whole body of research. Programs like Rosetta@Home (using the BOINC client) or Folding@Home can run invisibly in the background, whenever you're not using the computer, or full time. The installation takes up a small amount of space, and you can easily control how much of your computer processing power you want dedicated to either program.

Most of us may not be scientists, virologists, epidemiologists or researchers but that doesn’t mean we are helpless or unable to contribute. Much can be done if we work together as a team, a country, and an international community.

I'm currently using store mi with a 128gb SSD and a 3 terabyte barracuda gaming HDD. This setup also includes using 2 gigabytes of RAM. I do find an increase in performance especially as I mostly use this computer for gaming and I like the fact that I don't physically need to move games between drives just for performance reasons.

about 1 week ago suddenly my pc startet to have a problem, i dont know what i changed or did wrong but maybe someone can give me a tip.

heres the problem: when playing games my System startet to stutter (like a huge fps drop) every 5 mins or so. otherwise everything runs very smoothly.

I noticed that every time it happens, all core but 1 do throtle for a second, whereas the other one spikes. I testet it on many games, more or less the same symptoms every time.

I dont have Precision-boost-override enabled and i left the cpu-clock at default.

I tried many things to troubleshoot:

\- set ram speed to default (2166 MHz), normally its at 3466 which worked fine for a long time.

\- reinstalled every driver i could (graphics driver too)

\- made sure the chipset-driver, uefi and win 10 is up to date

\- ran the amd cleanup utility

\- set everything on ""auto"" in uefi

-Power supply (model and manufacturer)
-RAM (model and manufacturer)
-hard drive (model and manufacturer)
-OS version (windows or Linux and what version)

For reference I had these drivers installed Clean via AMD'ds own deep clean option (uninstalls previous drivers and reinstalls them)  I also went ahead and used DDU to remove the drivers and again reinstall them, the crashing still persists.  

I really hate to have to downgrade to previous drivers, but for a set of drivers that supposedly ""fixed"" alot of things, it sure hasn't done much for my experience.  My 5700 XT was giving me a few issues here and there but they were very minimal, this current drivers are making me very disappointed in AMD.

Alright so I built this recently, like a few days ago, and it was running fine. The main thing that I noticed, however, was that my cpu was running quite hot. It was idling at 1.4hz 65C constantly and some games would push it to 95c. I tried every HW monitor (one at a time) and they all showed the same readings.

I downloaded all the latest drivers and windows updates. Used AMD's balanced powerplan, reseated the stock cooler and applied aftermarket thermal paste.

None of this worked.

The only thing left to do was flash the motherboard BIOS. So I went over to the msi website and downloaded the latest bios for my motherboard onto a flash drive.

In the PDF of how to flash the motherboard, it said a prompt would show up to select the BIOS file. Well, mine didn't. Mine went straight to a black screen and will not show anything on any of the video inputs.

What do I do now? Do I clear CMOS? If I do that, this board is one of the ones that needed to be updated for the latest ryzen processors and I'm not sure factory settings will boot it to that bios version. 

(I didn't download any bios for my ryzen cpu to work, just saw it mentioned that some of these motherboards don't come ready out of the box but I guess I got lucky).",4,1584086599,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fhw797/black_screen_after_trying_to_flash_mobo/,Amd,1

Yet since I started using the card I would get the occasional green screen while playing a game like minecraft or league of legends.

Yet Sometimes when waking my computer from sleep or playing games live Devil May Cry 5 my screens turn completely black as if the graphics card just completely disconnected itself from the monitors. I am updating my drivers now to see if this issue is fixed but I dont know what to do anymore at this point, I've tried fresh driver installs and everything but I am really getting tired of trying to force my card to work. When it does work it works amazing, but these intermittent issues are just killing my experience overall. I really do love this card but it is causing large amounts of issues with my general experience using it and the drivers associated with it, I am contemplating switching back to Nvidia if I can't figure out how to get this card to a point where it is usable for me.

fht2q0,Krakenader,"Hi, My Name is Krakenader And I suffer From Driver Depression","It was a cold morning in December. I was so elated at building a new computer. I remember methodically researching components, checking motherboards and its supported ram with the QVL lists. So much joy, like a kid making out his wish list for Christmas. When it was time to find the right GPU, one beacon of light shown brighter than the others; the RX 5700XT. 

It was love at first sight; price to performance was a dream. I took the plunge and bought the card, along with the other components. 

After several days of looking out the window, hoping that by chance a package might be delivered earlier than expected, my computer parts finally came. Building it was such a joy, everything went well. With the build done, everything seemed to work perfect...for the first few hours. And then... its hard to say it out loud.... but the RX5700xt starting HITTING ME. 

It started with a nasty freeze and random BSOD's. It didn't take much to anger it. Of course I didn't know it at the time It was the RX 5700 XT that was HiTTING ME. When you build a new computer and you get random crashes and BSOD's, you think that possibly your hardware is faulty. That's when the panic set in. 

I ran memory tests and other stress tests. They all came back good. What was I to do? I had no other ddr4 laying around, no other PSU to swap in. I felt stranded. Do I just return everything.... do we need to split up?

I decided to not blame my  RX5700XT..... it couldn't be it. It ran all the benchmarks flawlessly  within expected norms. 

Before giving up hope I did a search and discovered that other people with the same model had similar issues. So after seeking council from the internet me and my RX 5700xt  decided to try some things. In fact we tried everything. 

Finally, the auto undervolt that we tried helped. 5700xt doesn't hit me as hard anymore, but it still hurts. It turns out that my 5700xt has physical and mental issues. 

You see, when my 5700xt was a child, it was taught wrong. It doesn't handle situations right because of faulty teaching. Don't misunderstand me, the 5700xt was not physically abused, that we can see. It seems to all be mental. And yet.... the 5700xt won't stop hitting.

Should I leave it? It keeps telling me its going to get better, that it will stop, but it still happens. I held out this long, because I am  a loving and patient person,  but how much more can I take? 

You know, my rx 470 never treated me this way. Maybe we should get together again.",12,1584069051,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fht2q0/hi_my_name_is_krakenader_and_i_suffer_from_driver/,Amd,1

* Absolutely insane MT perfomance (almost 2.5x the competition in CB)
* Battery life is decent but has room for improvement in new designs. (The Matebook 14 beats it, but is by far the  best 3500u implementation) still beats Ice-lake though

fhpv2o,alifirouzi77,Don't close Radeon Control Panel if you use custom Wattman profiles for your games!,"So recently, I tried adding custom profiles to my games and put 1900MHz at 1015mv as my minimum clock speed so it wouldn't drop below 1900Mhz when GPU is not at full utilization (That fixed stutters I had with Witcher 3 due to some camera angles being more demanding, but it'd take GPU some time to go from let's say.... 1400Mhz to 2000Mhz, thus causing microstutters)  


Rapidly turning the camera around with global settings: (As you can see the GPU gets confused and doesn't boost the clock right away)

These were my global settings so the GPU would rest when not gaming:

And these were for demanding games That I'd lock FPS. Because with global settings, the clock speed would jump up and down due to different areas not being equally demanding:  


https://preview.redd.it/1zol39rcgbm41.png?width=1460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52488cd48c67dd4f2f7fc4b08f0f2ce04e6cb128

But there was a problem.... The games would run fine without any issues, but right when I'd quit the game and go back to desktop, everything would freeze after 5 seconds... and no where to go but to restart (Tested with every single game I had)  


My take was that due to pretty much everything being slow in AMD drivers just like the fan control, It would take a lot of time for the drivers to revert back to global settings and reducing the clocks back to the ""normal"" 800Mhz (even Wattman would show that after quitting a game it'd take some time for the clocks to change back from game profile to global)  
After doing a lot of stupid things like increasing voltage for all the 3 phases and also removing Afterburner, it turns out.. closing the control panel out of habit, before starting games, would cause this issue! Maybe the voltage drops down before the clock does and makes it unstable? Doesn't matter right now because the fix for it is to just keep the control panel open!   
I even tested it multiple times where the control panel was in tray and still had the desktop freeze! So make sure to keep it in your taskbar!  
I hope this post would at least help people who have stutters in some of their games (This issue only happens with Vsync=on where games usually need to maintain a stable FPS or they'd just try to drop down to keep it stable. So freesync users might not even have this problem)

I use a Gygabyte GeForce Windforce OC 1660ti, the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X with Wraith Prism and 2x8Gb of Corsair 3200Mhz RAM. The problem is I only get 80-90 fps with graphics set to ""Epic"" while playing overwatch for example. I thought this was weird as I've seen videos with the same exact build getting a lot more fps in this game, like [this one](https://youtu.be/5I5EKOGRSI4). My fps when playing Overwatch goes to 100 or so and then go rapidly back to 85 fps. Also I noticed I have no AMD Ryzen Optimized energy option in Windows 10, only the other three modes. Another thing I see is when I'm playing Overwatch, my CPU is at 7-8% in task manager while my GPU is over 60-70%, is this normal or am I doing something wrong? I haven't overclocked anything, the only thing I've changed on the Bios is the XML option to get to 3133Mhz with my RAM.

fhmtj7,MahtXL,MCC CE Online Crashing (Fatal Error),"Trying to figure out if this is a game issue or an AMD issue. There is a mention of fatal error crashing on the MCC support site, but since the steam forums only have a small number of people complaining about this and we all seem to have RDNA gpus, im thinking the issue is on the AMD side.  


A quick overview of the issue- Every part of the MCC plays and runs fine EXCEPT Halo-CE online. CE online forces old style graphics and i think this may be part of the issue, something about it does not get along with RDNA gpus causing a freeze, and then the fatal error crash of the game.  


For me personally i can play 3 matches roughly before i get the freeze and crash randomly mid match.  


If you have this issue please report it to AMD. There is currently no way to report it to the devs of the game because its already a ""known issue"" However i have a feeling this is more an AMD issue than a game issue. Every person on the forums with this issue has an RDNA gpu, and while playing with my friend who is running my old R9 390 i crashed and he did not, so that tells me all i need to know.  


 Please help me report this to AMD so i can play the game i payed for with my 650 dollar (cad) gpu. At this point the 5700 xt issues are tiring, and if they carry on any longer i might smash this thing with a hammer. I would post a link to the report issue page here but the website isnt responding go figure, broken gpu and broken website............",0,1584044313,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fhmtj7/mcc_ce_online_crashing_fatal_error/,Amd,1

fhmgug,Mataskarts,StoreMi Question,"Hey, so I have an Msi X570 motherboard, Intel 600p series 256 gb TLC system drive. And a SLOW AF Seagate Barracuda 3tb from 2017, was unable to find it's rpm, but I think it's 5400, \~50 mb/s sequantial read/write..... The drive is painfully slow, I have no money to shell out on a 512-1tb ssd for game storage, so my games are on the hhd, all of them.

Problem is, some games take up to 10 minutes to load when on my ssd it's \~15 seconds, even games like ksp for those who know- In order to get into a building I have to wait 1 minute instead of \~4 seconds=absolutely unplayable...

\&gt;Questions:

Am I able to allocate \~50 gb of my \*SYSTEM/BOOT\* ssd to caching using StoreMi? And if yes, will I have to reinstall windows?

Also, can I use a few gb of my ram to act as a cache using StoreMi or similar software? I saw an ltt video and they recommended PrimoCache, but that costs money and I'd rather spend that money on an actual ssd if it comes to it..

&amp;#x200B;

If neither is possible or I have to reinstall windows(which would be veryannoying) I'll just probably get into the habit of playing a single game and having it on my ssd, main problem is that the ssd has only 80 gb free=1 game... Also, If I fill it up to the point of &lt;30gb remaining it slows down dramatically..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr- Can I use my BOOT ssd or some of my RAM to act as a cache and speed up load times without doing anything major like reinstalling windows or spending money?

fhm8h2,Kevin9809,"Upgrading CPU (i5 3570k), Mobo, RAM, etc.","I was trying to hold out for AMD and/or Intel's next releases, but I think I may have to pull the trigger sooner rather than later due to some issues I'm running into with some newer games, especially if I attempt to stream games.

I will need to upgrade my CPU, mobo, and ram, and purchase a new CPU cooler and PSU. I'm leaning towards AMD Ryzen lineup over Intel since I plan on streaming, but I'm all for buying the i9 9900k if people think that's a better decision from a gaming standpoint. If I go AMD, I was looking at the 3700x or 3900x.

As mentioned above, my PC is primarily used for gaming and streaming. For reference, my current build is listed below. You can assume everything was purchased and built in July 2012 unless otherwise stated. I have included the upgrade questionnaire following my current build information.

**CURRENT BUILD:**

CPU:Intel Core i5-3570K 3.4GHz Quad-Core Processor

Cooler:Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO 82.9 CFM Sleeve Bearing CPU Cooler **- replaced the CPU fan in late 2018 due to failure**

Motherboard:ASRock Z77 Extreme4 ATX LGA1155 Motherboard

Memory:G.SKILL TridentX Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory **- purchased in October 2016**

Hard Drive:Samsung 860 EVO 1TB 2.5 Inch SATA III Internal SSD **- purchased in February 2019**Seagate Barracuda 1TB 3.5"" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive **- formatted but no longer used as I was worried the drive may have been failing prior to purchasing the SSD; will probably buy a cheap replacement at some point**

Video Card:GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 2070 WINDFORCE 8GB GDDR6 Video Card **- purchased Jan 2019 (orig Nov 2018 - first 2070 card failed)**

Case:Cooler Master HAF 922 ATX Mid Tower Case **- replaced the front and top 200mm fans due to rattling**

Power Supply:PC Power &amp; Cooling 750W ATX12V / EPS12V Power Supply

Optical Drive:Lite-On iHAS124-04 DVD/CD Writer

Monitors:Acer Predator XB271HU bmiprz 27"" WQHD (2560x1440) NVIDIA G-SYNC IPS Monitor **- purchased in summer 2018**HP VH240a 23.8"" 1080p - **purchased in summer 2019**

Operating System:Microsoft Windows 10 **- purchased Windows 7 in 2012 and upgraded to Windows 10**

**UPGRADE QUESTIONNAIRE:**

**Approximate Purchase Date:** ASAP

**Budget Range:** No real limit, but I would prefer to keep the CPU under $500.

**System Usage from Most to Least Important:** Gaming, Streaming, General Web Browsing

**Are you buying a monitor:** No

**Parts to Upgrade:** CPU, mobo, RAM, CPU cooler, PSU, thermal paste?, other, if necessary?

**Do you need to buy OS:** No - I purchased Windows 7 (upgraded to Windows 10) with my original build.

**Preferred Website(s) for Parts:** Amazon.com, [Newegg.com](https://Newegg.com)

**Location:** Jacksonville, Florida, USA

**Parts Preferences:** Leaning towards AMD Ryzen, but also like Intel

**Overclocking:** I do noob-friendly overclocking lol

**SLI or Crossfire:** No

**Your Monitor Resolution:** 2560x1440

**Additional Comments:** I currently play games such as Apex Legends and BF5. I want to play the new COD BR, but I get 100% CPU usage and crashing on my current build.

**And Most Importantly, Why Are You Upgrading:** My CPU and mobo are the last living relics in my build. It's time for me to stop pushing this upgrade off and get it done!",36,1584042201,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fhm8h2/upgrading_cpu_i5_3570k_mobo_ram_etc/,Amd,1

Here are my current settings: Amd Cool'n'quiet ON, ECO mode through BIOS : 65W, PBO off, Ryzen High Performance Power Plan, latest bios and chipset for my MOBO.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, some questions: 

* Is it normal for my cpu to run so hot during the application? Prime95 with small FTTs also makes it instantly go to 90C. The CPU runs very cool and is dead silent during normal usage otherwise. 
* Why is it stuck to 1.2v 3.9Ghz? HWinfo64 says it is not thermal throttling itself.
* Does PBO do much? Is it worth enabling?
* Does the 65W mode significantly reduce heat and performance? I don't see much of a heat reduction from enabling it in these applications.",12,1584032765,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fhjnpl/foldinghome_and_3600x/,Amd,1

fhitmt,mcfappers,ryzen 5 3600x and asus prime a320m-k mobo,"Hey,

So the story goes that I have bios version 5220 on my asus prime a320m-k MOBO, (now yes i know this motherboard isnt brilliant! but it does the job for me.) My partner brought me the ryzen 5 3600x. I am already running the ryzen 3 3200g (so you can see why i want an upgrade)

I have seen online that people are saying its not compatible. Although on the official asus page for the mobo it says that with bios update 4801 it can run the ryzen 5 3600x.

my question is: can the ryzen 5 3600x run on my asus prime a320m-k WITH my current bios? im not too fussed if it throttles as i will be upgrading the mobo at some point in the not too far future.

here is a link to prove i am running the 3200g on bios 5220 with the prime a320m-k and the website stating the 3600x is supported after update 4801[mobo info and support list (imgur)](https://imgur.com/a/w4NsvDV)

&amp;#x200B;

now yes it looks like i have done all my research etc, however i am simply looking for a second opinion as to whether my thought process is correct. also, this is my first time upgrading a cpu so you cant blame me for wanting to get it right.",15,1584029754,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fhitmt/ryzen_5_3600x_and_asus_prime_a320mk_mobo/,Amd,1

fhi822,KarmaOuterelo,Upgraded to 3600X: GPU fans at 100% during boot,"Hello to you all,

I've recently upgraded to a Ryzen 3600X from a 7700K that I sold to a friend.  
As motherboard I've been using the [ASUS ROG STRIX X470-I](https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/ROG-STRIX-X470-I-GAMING) and initially the system didn't boot, so I managed to find a 2700X with which I could upgrade the BIOS to the latest one available (version 3004, 1.0.0.4 patch B).

After that, I gave the 3600X a second run and... Well, now I can get it to boot, but it takes about **5-10 seconds** of noisy hell (**GPU fans at 100%**) for the system to behave properly and get to Windows.  
**Sometimes it does not even boot** without me accessing the BIOS which, by the way, restores to default every time this happens.

I upgraded to an NVME SSD as well, but this system is not only louder at boot but also slower than one  of the PCs I built last week with an i7 4770 and an old SATA SSD.

I've found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ccsi10/gpu_fans_spin_to_100_on_bootwake_with_ryzen_3600/) yet I could not find an answer in there. I've also read online that this latest BIOS solved most of people's problems... But definitely not mine.

Any kind soul has any clue of how could I fix this? I would'nt mind to lose a few MHz, but this screaming agony that my PC goes through every time I reboot it is awfully annoying.

Best regards and thanks in advance.",8,1584027520,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fhi822/upgraded_to_3600x_gpu_fans_at_100_during_boot/,Amd,1

fhi63b,SolitaryEgg,Stock-clocked Ryzen 2600x always running at max clock and voltage (even at idle). I can't figure it out. Help please!,"Alright guys, I am losing my mind here. I've read every forum and reddit post possible, tried everything, and I cannot figure this out.

I'm running a stock/not-overclocked 2600x with the stock spire cooler. Motherboard is an ASRock b450m/ac.

The first thing I noticed after building the PC was that it ran sorta hot at idle (around 60c). I did all the normal troubleshooting (re-paste, fan curves, etc). In the end I figured it was perhaps just normal Ryzen behavior on the stock cooler, so I didn't really worry about it much.

But, as time went on, I began to realize that it's because the thing *never* really downclocks. There are some minor bursts up and down, but all cores stay at 1.3-1.4 volts and 3800+ mhz, *always.* Even as I type this.

The only way I can get it to stop is to change the power settings to Power Saver, then the voltage drops to .8 or so and the clocks to ~2,000. But, this isn't a great solution, as it seems to limit the boost and it affects gaming pretty badly. But, my temps instantly drop from 55-60c to like 30c at idle.

THINGS I'VE TRIED:

- Both Ryzen Balanced and Windows Balanced power plans. Neither makes a difference. I've ensured that the minimum processor state is set to 5% in the power plan. Makes no difference.

- Bios settings. There are so many different answers online for what bios settings would affect this, but most of them are not options on my ASRock b450m/ac. I've heard people recommend turning on cool'n'quiet, change CPPC settings, etc. But, none of these are options in my bios. I did find the ""global c-states"" setting and enabled it, but it made no difference.

- Processes. I've gone through them, and nothing seems to be using many CPU resources.


I've *considered* updating bios, but it always worries me, and ASRock recommends not updating past my current version with a pinnacle ridge processor.

Am I nuts? Is this normal behavior? It just seems so weird that my CPU seems to be stuck in max boost when I'm just browsing the web, or even if I walk away from my computer for a few hours. 

Any ideas on what the issue could be? Thanks!",2,1584027317,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fhi63b/stockclocked_ryzen_2600x_always_running_at_max/,Amd,1

fhhhc1,vincentjonathan,"3600 @ 4.2ghz, on less than 1.25v... is it normal?","I think i manage to run my 3600 @ 4.2ghz on 1.25v

I upgraded my CPU from 1600x to 3600 today, then i just enable ""Game Boost"" mode on my BIOS. My motherboard is MSI X370 Gaming Pro Carbon btw.

When i ran small FFTs test on Prime95, my temperature is ridiculously high (about 94c), i then checked my BIOS and found out that my CPU voltage is set to 1.4v (on auto), so i set the CPU volt manually as low as i can and make sure the system is stable.

I ended up with 1.25v which i think is pretty low. The temperature on 1.25v is around 76c when running small FFTs test on Prime95 and 61-63c when running Cinebench R15. I manage to ran 3x cinebench R15, small FFTs test on prime95 for few minutes, and custom all thread test on prime95 for few minutes without any crashes  


I have 2 questions:

1. Is it normal that a 3600 can run at 4.2ghz on 1.25v? (I think i can go even lower like 1.225v, since i tried 1.2v and it manage to run small FFTs test but not custom all thread test)
2. Is my temperature normal?

fhgz8v,Batmanshadow,3950x water cooling help,"First, pardon my English and grammar

Its been almost a week since i have had the 3950x, I slapped on the H110i that i had for my 2700x, here is the thing. I know Custom water loop cooling is the ideal, I get that. But currently, I have a 2 140mm Nactua fans in the front, 1 140mm exhaust in the rear of the case (corsair 760t) and 4x140mm fans on the radiator which is mounted on the top of the case. LL140 on the bottom of the rad and i believe i have case fans that came with the case on the top of the rad, exhausting out. Full load test and stress about 68-70. So Looking to upgrade if I get a custom loop with a monoblock on 420mm rad, and pump/res. looking at around $450-500. All the AIO's I am looking at are either 280mm and 360mm. I would like to go 360mm but then my 140MM fans wont fit. 

So trying to see what is the best option. Is a 360MM rad better than a 280mm, for the 3950x? I know I should probably swap the LL140 fans with the Nact. fans or the case fans with the Nact, but if im going to do that i might as well just grab me a new AIO. What are you running on the 3950x and what temps? I am also on stock speeds, for now. I have been messing with OC, but when i see the temps jump to 75+ my heart skips a beat

TLDR
Keep my 140MM fans grab another 280mm aio
Move my 140MM fans grab a 360mm Aio

fhd22f,Spinalcore,Confusing Ryzen 7 2700 overclocking issue,"I have the Ryzen 7 2700 manually overclocked to 4.1 GHz but the last few days when I look at the CPUID HWMonitor it is reading a fair bit higher than that. A couple days ago it said it was running at 4.5 GHz then today it said it hit 4.7 (4689 MHz) while playing The Division 2, World of tanks, Star Trek Online, Elder Scrolls Online and Black Desert Online.

Even the task manager was showing that it was hitting those speeds in the games. Nothing changed in my settings or anything and the PC hasn't been rebooted for a few days nor received any updates. It started to do this ""boosting"" a few days after the last windows update was forced through on me.

Temps aren't getting high with maxing out at 69C on the package, 66C on the cpu temp, Voltage values all look good. 

Package Power looks like it has gone up to 95-117.64 Watts a few times but normally sits around 30-40 Watts. All within what I have seen oc power usage values from tech reviews on it.

Using an ASUS Strix B450-F gaming motherboard with 4x8GB Teamgroup VulcanZ 3000 memory, Core Voltage is set to 1.4 where it doesn't go any higher but I do set it to the power saving profile when I head off to bed if I don't have it doing anything like downloading or updating my games.

Just trying to figure out what is happening since that kind of a boost you would expect some increases in your temps. Is it maybe a Bios setting that is allowing it to boost past a manual overclock setting? But why would it only start in the last week when the Bios was last updated in December when the Motherboard, Ram and CPU were upgraded from the 1st Gen 1600X and B350 motherboard.

fhcuy8,Sumoleon,rx580 - tweaking performance in msi afterburner,"Hi,

I have rx580 nitro+ 4gb version. I'd like to create such config for it in msi:

\-Has two profiles, ""normal"" and ""limited""

\-I can manually set it to ""normal"", but after system reboot it will go back to ""limited""

&amp;#x200B;

""Normal"" is... well, normal, but undervolted a bit. That's what I have now all the time

""Limited"" is either underclocked or with some lower temp limit. Most of the time I'm playing some old games like starcraft, browse web etc and my gpu is doing calculations (foldingathome). However it's running at 100% all the time then so it gets kinda loud. I would like to limit gpu power by 30-50% in that state

&amp;#x200B;

So, is this possible? If yes:

\-how can I make afterburner to auto apply specific config at startup instead of last used?

So I install the newest driver from AMD.com.... do the factory install. Go into the game, okay 20 more fps, game seems to be running fine. BAM, HARD CRASH. This time coming back into windows, driver doesn't say anything about crashing. But I KNOW its the driver, because its the only thing causing the issue.

While on the 2019 driver, I tried lowering cpu clocks just to be safe, even lowering memory from 3600 to 3200. Crashes still happen.

fh8ti0,alkradev,Defective 3700x?,"Hi everyone,

I've built three Ryzen systems so far, starting with a 1600 with a ton of stability issues (microstutters, the board effectively frying the CPU if left to run all-auto by driving insane CPU and SoC voltages), going to a 2700 where I lost the silicon lottery and can't get past the 3.75GHz barrier unless I bump the voltage from 1.2 to 1.325 (going from 3.75 to 3.8 requires that, yes).

So just today, I received my 3700x and popped it into my MSI B450M Mortar board (which has great VRMs from my experience) with a 240 rad cooling it. After initial shenanigans with the idle CPU voltage being shockingly high to me (before I read into the details), I've updated all my drivers and started over again.

Voltages are now lower when idle, but as soon as I put a heavy load onto the CPU (e.g. synthetic - P95), the voltages spike into the 1.4 - 1.45 range under load and stay there. I went into the bios and set an offset of -0.1 and now get voltages in the 1.32 - 1.36 range whilst under load which is not acceptable to me. The CPU clocks itself between 3.8GHz and 4.3GHz, temperatures generally stay below 70°C, but I get greatly decreased performance in benchmarks for example, if I stay at this (unsafe) load voltage or go even further and set a greater negative offset (e.g. -0.15 which gives me approximately 1.3v under a constant full load).

My question is, am I really just in a streak of bad luck or has anyone else experienced something similar? I don't want to degrade my CPU in a couple of days by keeping this up, but I also want a proper experience that I've paid for. I suppose the only option I have with my current chip is to deal with the subpar performance by undervolting it heavily, or maybe RMA it? Does what I am experiencing warrant it?

To be clear, I did nothing but reboot my computer between it running smoothly (though unstable) and it running games at half the framerate with constant stutters. No, I don't understand it. All drivers and BIOS are the latest versions.

I got it just a week ago and built my PC. Everything seemed fine, except it would occasionally crash. No clear trigger, but BlueScreenView showed that it was something with atikmpag.sys, dxgkrnl.sys, and/or ntoskrnl.sys, with dxgkrnl.sys being the one mentioned. I couldn't find any solutions online.

When the computer crashed, the screen would turn black followed by an audio loop around a second later. However, it seems it still functioned as a BSOD as it gathered information and eventually rebooted on its own.

But today, after a week of random crashes, I rebooted my computer and tried to play Forza Horizon 4. 30 fps and stuttering. It used to run at 50-60 fps just fine (other than crashing). I then tested it in various other games and they all had the same result, around half the framerate they used to get and heavy stuttering.

I know the crashing was not an overheating issue. It crashed in the main menu of Stardew Valley, and it had crashed once while no games were running and I was in the shower. Same error reported every time.

Contacting XFX about this is a last resort for me, because I'd rather not pay for the shipping to have them *maybe* repair or replace the card.

From #56D3D is introducing D3D9on12 with resource interop APIs and adding similar resource interop APIs to D3D11on12.  With this new support, callers can now retrieve the underlying D3D12 resource from the D3D11 or D3D9 resource object even when the resource was created with D3D11 or D3D9 API.

Am I reading this correctly where MS will add native support an Archaic DirectX9/11 over DX12 similar to the methodology used in DXVK?   From my research back with DX11 was a hot topic AMD's main issue with the lack of native DCL support for the API in their drivers leading to poor multithreaded support when it came to the API and driver interaction, as the new management took over it was considered too much work to go back to the drawing board and attempt to implement when they started pushing the mantle initiative.

I am trying to optimize memory performance of a 3970x with 8 DIMMs, but I can't get close to the numbers I'm seeing around here. There's a lot of posts with AIDA64 screenshots of 50-55GB/s bandwidth and 65-70ns latency (dual channel).

I don't have a Windows install (running Linux), so I can't test with AIDA64. I'm using Intel memory latency checker (available for both windows and Linux https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intelr-memory-latency-checker) and the numbers I'm getting is 86GB/s and 87ns on 3600cl16  (76GB/s and 95ns on 3200cl16).

So,  is the latency kinda bad because of 4 channel memory or is it because of a badly tuned system? Or does it have to do with how AIDA64 vs Intel MLC measures?
The bandwidth also seems low compared to dual channel. Shouldn't it be around 100GB/s if the number of channels is doubled?

The memory kit is Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200cl16 8x32GB. It passes memtest86 at both 3200 and 3600. Timings are unchanged from the XMP profile (16-20-20-20-38 I think). I tried cl14, but it does not boot then.
MB is Asus rog strix trx40-e gaming with latest bios (0807). No overclock on cpu, FCLK manually set to 1800MHz.

Does anyone have any ideas regarding high latencies like this or thoughs on the bandwidth? It would be nice if someone could compare results between AIDA64 and Intel MLC.",10,1583957868,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fh3l7o/high_threadripper_3970x_memory_latency/,Amd,1
fh34u1,tarrelbeer,"Freezes and instability on AMD build, need advice!","During gaming: Strange instabilities and freezes. Framerates are high in all my games (80+) and performance seems great, but at seemingly random interval games will completely freeze for anywhere between 5 seconds to - 15 seconds. Freezes seem to happen often after 'loading' segments or high intensity area's, but also during minimal load with high framerates. Temperatures are not low (small crowded case) but well within normal. Any competitive game is rendered unplayable, because freezes will happen 2-3 times at least every 45 minutes at random moments.

VR games seem to be immune to the freezes so far, which is strange. 

In normal windows 10 use, problems are not as noticeable, but still at random applications will turn unresponsive such as windows explorer, chrome, or slow loading / opening times of other applications to the point that im bothered by it.

The build is completely new since black friday in november. (upgrade from FX series and HD7970 which i had for a long time) Had problems with the build during since the beginning, but didn't want to cry wolf before trying every single software fix or blaming the individual games / applications but now im getting hopeless.

Solutions i've tried:

* at least a dozen adrenalin drivers
* Upgraded BIOS to latest, even though shipped version is listed compatible.
* Fresh windows 10 install build 18363 and updated
* Ran multiple games in different qualities, framerates and resolutions (1080p, 1440p, 4k)
* Turned off all aux features of radeon control panel (freesynch/enhanced sync, overlay)
* windows power settings to performance
* undervolted gpu, cpu
* GPU in different slots and PCI-e bus multipliers

Build:

* Ryzen 5 3600
* Asrock B450m Pro4
* Gigabyte 5700 XT, current driver 20.2.2

* 500W PSU

fh2bwd,Womkas,Ryzen 3900x Overclocked Vcore BIOS vs VCore Ryzen Master,"Hello there,

I've got the 3900x in my fingers and paired it with a X570 Aorus Ultra motherboard from Gigabyte.

So far everything was always on stock settings, but since I had now seen that according to CPU-Z the voltage shoots up to 1.4V, I tried something out. The Ryzen Master tool allows me to limit the ""peak core voltage"" without direct BIOS access and at the same time to adjust the clock for individual cores or all at the same time.

I thought that would be a great tool to first find out the sweet spot at which minimum CPU voltage is still running properly. So I have now landed at 4.2 Ghz Baseclock for all cores with a ""peak core voltage"" of 1.275V.

When I wanted to make these values ​​permanent (Ryzen Master has to load the profile manually each time), I found that both Ryzen Master and HWInfo now display the voltage around 1.1V, even though I set the VCORE in the BIOS to this 1.275 V set - but the system runs stable as far as I could determine so far. Is that a measurement error in the programs? I installed the latest chipset drivers + performed the BIOS update when I set up the computer again. The energy saving plan runs on ""Ryzen Master Balanced"".

According to Stresstest the CPU now is definetely faster and has around 15 W less energy consumption, which sounds too good for me? The siliconlottery said, that 6% of the best CPUs get 4,2 Ghz on 1,25V.... so this cant be right i guess.

&amp;#x200B;

But why do I have this big shift in shown data, no matter if i use CPU-Z, Ryzen Master, HWInfo, HWMonitor (they actually show me just 1,06 V)...

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any comparative values ​​or reviews with the same board? :)

I would be very happy!

I had initially looked into the 5700XT, but found that a 2060 Super performs much better thanks to Cuda. The 5700XT is slightly cheaper, and appears to perform better in video games, but does not perform as well in Blender when compared to the 2060 Super.  

To make up for the slightly higher cost of the 2060 Super, I could get the 3600 instead of a 3700X.

fgwbpk,SixTheNinth,Weird flickering of the textures in games RX570,"Hello Red Team!   


I have noticed that in number of games my card develops  a weird flickering effect caused most likely by AA setting, but perhaps in combination with other features. As an example I will attach a short clip from No Man's Sky that represents the defect throughout. The interesting thing about it is that it does not happen in all games, only in some.   


I have tried various drivers to see if problem persist - 19.12.1 , 19.9 and the latest 20.2 1 - none of them fixes the problem. Let's talk about Vulkan powered No Man's Sky. First I let the app take over - flickering is heavies at TAA settings and slightly less intensive with FXAA and AA off. But is always there to some extent. When I choose AMD settings overriding the apps AA settings or enhancing, I cannot see any difference in game, almost like it does not work. No matter if I choose 8x or 2x AA, the effect is still the same which is super weird.   


I really hope some of you will know this problem and how to fight it. Also, should I keep updating my drivers to the latest or stick older drivers in general? IF so, which drivers would you recommend me to keep for my card?

Suddenly, all my **windows** **start bugging** \- no letters can be recognizable, just weird blocks of pixels showing up all over the windows, really hard to describe, really. (On main screen - **Overwatch**; on secondary - **Spotify** and **Discord**). I still can hear the **audio clearly**, but I can't do anything else than **restarting the PC**. It takes a lot longer than usual (from **20-25s** to **2+** minutes) and it usually ended up losing my team the competitive game.

I've used **Wallpaper Engine** when this first happened, so I stopped using it (I don't know why, I just had an idea), but since then, it happened 2 more times. I keep my drivers updated. I really have no idea what is causing this.

So I noticed that with all the PBO overclocks maxed, set as it should be, I have high idle temps of 60 just doing general browsing, which causes my fans to be crazy (having a mini-itx, I have to deal with reduced airflow in my case). My load temps never really go past 75, and I don't mind the fans cranking up a bit when necessary, but them blasting that hard and temps of 60 just at idle is annoying.

I noticed when I change my Power Optiosn to ""Power Saver"", boom, my idle immediately drop almost 30C and my fans just turn off and passive cooling is enough for my mini-itx build for general browsing and usage.

Is there a performance loss to this? I just want to make sure when I'm gaming or streaming, or need the power, that it's there.

Since I updated the BIOS I've noticed that my games started crashing randomly. Every few hours my games start crashing, sometimes in the menu and while playing and sometimes while being alt-tabbed out checking something on the internet.

After doing some research I've seen a few posts from people using the Ryzen 3600 that started using the BIOS version [1.0.0.4](https://1.0.0.4) and had similar issues like myself.

The only fix that I've currently found is reverting the BIOS to [1.0.0.3](https://1.0.0.3) ABB (not ABBA!). So if you have problems with your games crashing randomly you can try this.

If somebody knows what is causing these crashes or if you need more info about my setup please ask in the comments.

fgp2ez,Frikcha,Just got my first ever AMD card and had my bias confirmed,"I recently purchased an ASUS Radeon RX 580 8gb OC card to replace my original card and the one's donated by my friends that also crapped eventually. It gave me several issues with crashing multiple games but I imagined that being because of the old board and ram and cpu, so I went and replaced all that too since it had been such a long time. Long story short I individually replaced every part of my PC until it was brand new and it still crashes the games I try to play. 

What I ended up with was an AMD Ryzen 5 3600, 
an MSI b450 amd gaming plus max motherboard, 
a SilverStone ST65F-GS 650W Strider 80+ Gold PSU,
and some RAM that couldn't be the issue since we've tested.

Me and my friends after hours and hours of troubleshooting over the course of about an entire month finally got it working last night if we mildly underclock  the card, but that means paying full price for a card I can't properly use or even overclock safely. 

The crashing in question is loss of signal to moniter, computer continues to chug on and give me sound as if nothing had happened but the screen just turns off and doesn't turn back on. Its fairly consistent when it does it; its either triple-a games just doing their thing and causing you to crash when you tab or leave game or start missions etc, but it also guaranteed crashed Dead by Daylight if its set to anything except low (which will still rarely crash).

As I said the issue has been temporarily fixed but only by cranking my card lower than usual which is not a long-term solution. Anyone know of any alternatives to just taking back the card and getting a new one? At this point with how much hassle and stress I've been through just to play 2 games from like 5 years ago it seems like a simpler solution to just abandon AMD out the gate but I don't want to do that because they're still reputable and well-priced and it may just be one thing on my end.",0,1583889991,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fgp2ez/just_got_my_first_ever_amd_card_and_had_my_bias/,Amd,1

So here’s where I’m confused:

3200 MHz CL16 has a calculated latency of 10ns

For example, just moving an Explorer window around (144hz monitor, btw), it's like something's sticky not letting the window move half the time.  If I play sound, and move the mouse around, static. Bad. (This is on either the built in Realtek audio OR a USB-connected headset).

If I move the NVME drive down to M2\_2, it's all glass smooth, the SSD runs in X4 mode, but the 5700XT ends up in X8 mode.  When in this configuration, everything is smooth as butter.  But, I'm sure I'll suffer reduced gaming performance...

fgk2sy,jono_82,RAM voltage and DOCP profile question,"I haven't built an AMD system in 10 years, but I've finally got around to it and hardware sitting in boxes for many months.  I haven't installed an OS yet but can get into the BIOS and everything appears to be working ok upon the first bootup.  The BIOS is so much more complicated than I'm used to but maybe that's just my specific ASUS board.  It seems like the same settings are accessible in 3-4 different ways via different menus, which I find a little strange, or am not used to.

Anyways, a quick question about RAM voltage.  I set the RAM frequency to run the stock xmp/docp profile.  It booted ok but it's inflating the voltage to 1.39 instead of the profile voltage of 1.35.  Is this normal?  Is it running memory training checks upon boot and adjusting the manually to what it thinks it needs to be stable?  Or is it just a stock voltage number that it always inflates to?  Is it self aware enough to know the right voltage, or is it guessing?

I'm used to this kind of thing happening with CPU voltage (within the OS) but it's the first time I've seen it with RAM in the BIOS.  If I underclock it back to 1.35 will it not post?

I'll be testing all of these things and eventually adding Ryzen RAM calculator settings but I can't work on the PC for the next 24 hours, so I wondered if anyone has an info/advice about this kind of thing.

I guess the question is.. is my motherboard sensing that this RAM needs more voltage and can't even run the stock profile at stock voltage, or is it worrying about nothing?  Is it a sign that I'm lacking headroom and that it'll struggle to OC well without pumping in large voltage increases?",6,1583870738,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fgk2sy/ram_voltage_and_docp_profile_question/,Amd,1

G.Skill Ripjaws V 32GB DDR4-3600MHz (F4-3600C16D-32GVKC) CL16-19-19-39  - 173 €

I've read 3600 MHz is the sweet spot when it comes to Ryzen, so I am going for that, but is CASS gonna makes a big difference? Naturally, I'd like to go for the cheapest (and spend the extra money at some other part), but I'm not sure whether CAS Latency: 19 would be a problem.

Or going for Crucial Ballistix Sport LT Gray 32GB DDR4-3200MHz (for 162 €, overclocked to 3600MHz  maybe if necessary, although I'd prefer not messing a lot with OC and stability is important), would be a better choice since CASS is 16?

Also, I read reports people having problem getting 3600MHz despite the fact the RAM they bought is sold like that. What's up with that and how can I be sure that won't happen in my case?

At times, they drop to 80. Sometimes I get over 200 but then they drop back to 150 after a while. I've seen on YouTube how people with exactly same setup get way more frames than me on 1080p.

fghr7l,when_they_cry,"Power efficiency gone from new drivers, how to lower low demanding games GPU/watt usage","Hi, i've switched to 20.2.2 back and forth trying to tweak power/gpu usage, my biggest gripe with new drivers is even IDLE with ULPS enabled, hardware accel disabled and 0 gpu usage the clocks stills stay at 700-500 range, low demanding game? 1050 clock always, even with radeon chill limited to 40-50 min max frames, the clock still stays at maximum power state (and yes it is working i can see it with my naked eye on 144hz display)
Before i was just always turning power efficiency on and the clocks would never ramp up this high.

IDLE desktop work was always 300-400 on 19.4.1
Why am i making such a problem out of this? 
I'm using Sapphire R9 Fury, it draws a lot of power unnecessarily, sometimes i'm playing something like Kenshi/Civ v for hours where having such high FPS doesn't matter, and it only wastes electricity heats up my room too much, this card draws 1,25 v at max power state... cmon
I want this card to live atleast 2 years more.

I'm less interested in max mhz and more in how low the timings I can get are. From that one slide amd had 3733 as the best bc u can run in a 1:1 ratio, so to go further from there you would want to lower timings. 

Also, if you oc the infinity fabric to 1900 mhz is it best to run in 3800 mhz for the ram?

The most expensive kit advertises the lowest timings but I'm wondering if the cheaper ones will do just as well.

fgf79r,aranorde,"5500XT users, How is your experience with 20.2.2 so far?"," I'm planning to get one.

Before  you crawl through my ventilation to stop me from buying one, let me  explain the issue. I initially bought a Gigabyte 1650 Super last year,  but I'm having fan revving issue so I'm going to change the card. I have  to pay $35 more the ROG Strix version or pay $55 for 5500XT Asus Dual  Evo. These are my options, most of the cards are sold out and the next  shipment in the local retailer will take more than a month. I need a  card for work so I can not wait that long.  
(Paid $160 for 1650 Super - ROG Strix is $195 ($35 more) and 5500XT is $215($20more from ROG))

I  thought $20 more for 5500XT WITH 8GB will be a future proof option,  I've also heard that 20.2.2 fixed over 40 issues. I just want to know if  it is worth it or not specially right now. There is no sign of any RX  580 cards or similar Polaris cards in my place.

I  also have a 450W PSU, i cant upgrade due to financial reasons. So I'm  keeping the cards under this, further limiting my options.

So I would highly appreciate if you can share your experience with 20.2.2.

fgesvt,Gigakv,"PSA: Several annoying issues regarding Ryzen 3000, Nvidia Turing and Corsair ICUE","My girlfriend got her first gaming pc during the holidays and was very excited, until it kept stuttering and rebooting that is. Took me a couple months to figure out all the issues with the build because I only had access to it on the weekends and it was hard to reproduce the issues.  
It is finally stable now so I thought I would share it here since it's a popular cpu\\gpu combo.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Compatibility issue between Zen 2 and Nvidia Turing.  
Using a Zen 2 CPU and NVIDIA Turing GPU (Possibly AMD GPU as well until they fixed it in the latest drivers) will cause stutter and black screens when using hardware acceleration.  
Best way to reproduce: Play a game then close it and immediately launch something that uses hardware acceleration, ie Chrome or Spotify.  
Temporary fix: Pick ""Prefer maximum performance"" in NVIDIA Control panel 3D settings.
2. Corsair ICUE crashing pc with Event ID 41 error and crashing games\\itself.  
Best way to reproduce: Unfortunately the PC crash was random for her but the game\\icue crash were due to Geforce experience overlay.  
Temporary fix: Delete  [cpuidsdk.dll  cpuidsdk64.dll and Corsair.Service.DisplayAdapter.exe](https://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=177867&amp;page=4&amp;t=177867&amp;page=4) and disable Geforce Experience overlay or completely uninstall ICUE.
3. Corsair ICUE possibly limiting CPU performance and boost frequencies.  
Best way to reproduce:  run cinebench with ICUE running then with ICUE and all Corsair processes killed from Task Manager.  
Temporary fix: Don't use ICUE.
4. PC rebooting after limiting monitor refresh rate to 71-144 with CRU with an Acer monitor.  
I many people are doing this but I'll still add this.  
Best way to reproduce: turn the monitor off and on while pc is running.  
Fix: Disable  **DDC/CI** in the monitor OSD settings or revert the CRU change.

Hi all,

Over the last 2 weeks my PC has been consistently restarting when playing various games.

I previously thought it was a CPU problem (I had a Ryzen 5 1600) and upgraded (to a Ryzen 5 3600) and updated BIOS however the issue still happens. I have also reset my RAM sticks and updated my GPU drivers.

At one point I noticed one of my HDD’s go to 100% but it was brief and I’ve noticed it now no longer renders footage in Premiere Pro properly where it used to.

For the first time today on one occasion it went to a blue screen which said: “Your PC needs to be repaired. Error code: 0xc000000e”  


I've had my PC restart 8 times last night just trying to load Rocket League...

I’m at my wits end and starting to consider just selling the parts and buying a new build. 

If anyone can help please do throw some suggestions my way!

The components I need to use on this machine are:

1 SATA SSD for the OS
1 SATA HDD for data storage.
An nvidia 1080ti GPU
An Intel Wigig card for wireless HDMI
32GB or DDR4 RAM. (I don't have this yet)
A 750W Powersupply 


Can anyone give any advice on if I need the high end motherboard? Can anyone provide any suggestions concerning a good motherboard for this system and perhaps suggest RAM specs too?

———————————————————————-
I currently have a six year old build EVGA GTX 770 and I’m considering upgrading to a 5700XT. The main reason for my preference for the 5700XT is due to cost compared to a decent RTX 2070 Super card and the current state of ray-tracing in games. 

I have currently overclocked my existing 8gb of ram to  2133MHz and plan buying an additional 8gb for the GPU upgrade. My main concern with upgrading to a 5700XT card would be the compatibility issues with ddr3 ram and an old Z87 board. Although I have heard of users with similar configurations to mine running ok with 1650TI and 2070 Super cards.",62,1583838309,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fgc3bb/considering_upgrading_to_sapphire_nitro_5700xt/,Amd,1
fgbuwa,lsstefan,Need some help with 2600x on x470 - weird bios behavior,"Hello.

A few days ago I made a system for myself with a 2600x and an Aorus X470 Gaming 7. Other specs: TForce 3000C16 Hynix AFR, 1 Kingston ssd (not m.2), 360 AIO (soon to be push pull) and GTX1060.

Atm I only play WoW at 1080p which is hungry for high freq so I'd like to squeeze max ST performance.

At first I only used XMP and PBO. After, I updated the bios from F8 to F50 because I thought maybe the OC could be better with a new BIOS version. 2 days after the BIOS update, the PC wouldn't boot. I had VGA led on and a different code every time I tried to boot. The monitor never showed bios loading screen regardless of much I spammed DEL. I fiddled with rams, gpu, psu etc and in the end I just reset CMOS and the PC started. Entered BIOS and I saw it was the standard F8. I didn't switch the keys from main to backup and also the MBIOS led was on, not the backup. 

For 1-2 days, I fiddled again with XMP, PBO, tried some manual OC to 4.2 and used the timing app to get better ram OC. At some point it didn't boot, prolly due to ram timings, it reset and in the CPUZ i noticed I got bios F50 back... Check main BIOS, had F50. The previous profile I saved from F8 was missing. Got back to fiddling and again after some ram errors it reverted to F8 and has been F8 for 1 day. MBIOS led was always on, I never saw it run in backup.

Now...my question is, what is happening? I get that F50 might have issues even though it worked and it's using the backup, but it was on main, so i thought it just copied it from backup to main, but how did it revert to F50 again by me not doing anything. I have OC profiles saved on both bioses, idk which one is up when I turn on the pc...

On another topic:

\- I had so many troubles trying to get tighter timings on ram, it never worked. I always used safe and last night I tried using V2 (low quality ram?) and it booted, but didnt have time to check if it's stable. Could my ram be that bad or V1 is used for Bdie and V2 for the rest? 

\- BCLK overclock 101 and 102, never booted. I assume it's RAM related (tried it just with XMP, not tight timings). Should I try BCLK and modify the ram multiplier to get close to 3000, since 3030 and 3060 didn't boot?

\- Which would be better if I get some to work: BCLK + PBO with lower RAM speed + higher offset (-50mV) or tighter RAM timings + lower offset (-100mV)?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the time and help. I will continue to fiddle with it as much as possible and try every combination, but any help is appreciated.",7,1583836970,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fgbuwa/need_some_help_with_2600x_on_x470_weird_bios/,Amd,1

I haven't ever ran across a company like AMD before. Putting in various quirks into their software/drivers like the ReLive vs Watching Videos or the Random Green Numbers so you remember that you have AMD everytime you launch a game and then watch videos. 

Aren't there better ways of doing this? I mean the CPU department doesn't do this? I'm never reminded that I have AMD through anything CPU related but up to 20+ times a day i'm reminded I have an AMD GPU. The worst part is some of them are even forced like the Green Numbers one with literally no possible way of disabling it!

This can't be good for business can it? 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously not everyone is the same but everytime I see the Random Green Numbers at the top left or my screen or when I watch a fullscreen video while/after playing a game I always think ""Oh right I have AMD!"" and I personally don't associate that with ""I'm happy I do.""

""Hey, this AMD is better than the Intel CPU you're planning to purchase...and it's $100 less.

Fast-forward and this thing has given me problem after problem, including the occasional ""Oh, I think I'll just restart myself suddenly and without warning for no apparent reason"". Presently, the biggest issue is that the network connection goes on and off at will. In order to work around this, I'm running the PC off my phone's hotspot.

$1100 well spent. Coincidentally, this is the first time I've gotten the courage to flash my BIOS. Actually, it was super easy and went without a hitch. Also, the memory clocked up to 3200 at the correct timing with 1.35V no XMP needed. Getting 33-37C idle, 63-77C under 100% load in Prime95, depending on which torture test is running. Going from MC SevTech Ages lagging at stock video settings, Civ5 lagging when zoomed out late game, and even Dragon Quest 11 lagging in towns to no lag max settings. Even added Optifine and ""Ultra"" shaders with BDCraft texture pack in SevTech just to see how it would do and 0 lag.

I plan to wait until gen 3 navi 5nm GPUs come out before upgrading GPU, maybe the drivers will improve by then as well.

fg7llx,ThatWideLife,Intel to AMD couldn't have been more of a chore to do.,"Let me preface this by saying most my issues were probably due to the motherboard but it was still infuriating.

So for starters I BSOD probably 20 time trying to install Windows 10. Turns out it was the wireless adapter on the board. Disabled that and finally was able to finish it.

Next up for whatever reason it wiped one of my SSD's entirely once I plugged it in. No idea why, never asked just did it.

Finally get to play around with the 3900x and my temps are 70c with a custom loop. Did some digging, asked for help, turns out the core voltages were way too high at stock. Turned it down a lot now it's upper 40's.

Finally some game time you'd think? Nope, of course not. Took me hours to figure out why none of my audio drivers were installed and why it wouldn't let me download it. I don't even know how I fixed it but finally got realtek to install. 

I don't know if this is an AMD thing or what but good lord this was painful. Maybe Microsoft and AMD don't play nice or it's just the stupid board that caused all the issues. Something that should've taken maybe an hour to do ended up taking me an entire day.

Well either way glad I made the switch just wished it was more streamlined. In case anyone is curious I got the MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon AC.

I want to overclock it as much as possible (3733mhz cl14). It's Trident Z RGB 3200c14 b die memory.

I already have this kit but don't really know if I should worry about the motherboard as much or not?

Should I go with the X470 Taichi for T topology or the VII Hero with daisy chain?

I was considering the X570 Taichi but read a comment on YouTube where the user wasn't getting the speeds he wanted because he thought it was a t topology board like the reviewers got and not daisy chain like the consumer variant.. (I'm not sure if they had b die or not)

fg19wf,rv6502,Three memory sticks on 1950X possible?,"It's kind of dumb, I know, but has anyone tried 3 memory sticks?

Background: I've ordered a 3200 to build a backup-storage file server and got all the parts except the two ECC RAM sticks (looks like they haven't even shipped yet). But I also got a 1950X with 4x 8GB ECC sticks with a 399X MSI board.

I can probably do my work with just 16GB if I'm careful until the other RAM sticks escape shipping-limbo but it got me wondering if 24GB would work too.

The manual only describes 1, 2, 4, and 8 sticks configs but since it's a CPU with 2 separate memory controllers with 2 channels each in theory it should be possible hardware-wise to have it work in a (1+1)+(1) single-channel config or 1x dual + 1x single channel config. Provided the BIOS can handle that weirdo setup and treat each memory controllers independently.   
My old laptop has 12GB 3x4GB sticks so it's not like it's a never-seen-before type of setup and that's just a dual-channel CPU.

My bet is that motherboard makers don't want to document every possible config to keep things simple and not get into tech-support nightmares so I'm not surprised it wouldn't be described even if it works \*with caveats maybe.

Anyone tried it?

If you tried a different motherboard / ThreadRipper combo with 3 sticks go ahead and share as well, which slots, if you had to change some BIOS settings, etc.

I'll try on mine tonight and update.   
Cheers,  


PS: it's borderline tech-support but I'm more going for a discussion about an undocumented feature (if it works).

&amp;#x200B;

Title says it all. I've to choose between R5 2600 (100€) and R5 3600 (180€):

relevant PC specs:

RAM: 32 GB 3600 MHz

GPU: RX 5700 XT

Monitor: 1440p 144 Hz

&amp;#x200B;

I've asked and looked around and I can't decide:

\- various people suggested me that R5 2600 runs like shit at 1440p 144 Hz compared to R5 3600;

\- from benchmarks found online it emerges R5 3600 is \~10% faster than R5 2600;

&amp;#x200B;

10% for 80€ doesn't look like a great deal, especially since I play only 1 hour per week and most of my games aren't demanding.

Until recently I have been operating the card with all features turned off and holding my breath for new drivers. With the past couple of driver releases the card feels much more stable and apt to handling a little tinkering which has got me wondering... What is the best way to optimize this thing?

washer mod

water block

Last year pieced together a build and bought this ram (BLS2K16G4D32AESE) prior to actually having mobo and CPU (x570 xtreme and 3950x). While the ram is running fine at 3200mhz on its xmp profile, I didn't know at the time how much of a boost faster ram would provide. Looking to upgrade to something running at a faster speed, but a few random questions

1. Is it possible to achieve those speeds running off an XMP profile, or does it require manual tweaks?
2. Does good/fast ram kit exist that isn't RGB ""enhanced""?
3. Is using two dims better than four dims, or vice versa?  

I want tweaking capabilities, but I also would like to be able to get things up and running (basically a known working XMP profile) for when I can't tweak but still get the most out of my machine.",21,1583767964,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ffwf9v/need_help_with_ram_upgrade/,Amd,1

Pulled the trigger and completed my build yesterday. 
It took me the whole day of following youtube and carefully installing.
Posted and booted with no problems.

So just a quick question to you all, 
Are there any basics to get done, after a fresh install of windows 10 and with all amd gear?
I downloaded Radeon software, and switched off windows 10 telemetry, but I was wondering is there any checklist to follow? or one that you follow whenever you make a build or fresh install ?
Thanks again :)

ffvz2e,FlameDB89,RX 5600 XT updated bios is not always stable,"Dears,

I'm owning a PowerColor RX 5600 xt Red Devil edition myself (should be one of the top 5600 xt cards) which was constantly giving me black screens during gaming.

One of the first things I did was update the bios (for the performance mode, as I'm not planning on using the silent mode) to the newest one (which basically ups the speed clocks).

I did a lot of research online and it seemed that the latest 20.2.2 drivers solved a lot of issues for a lot of users, but I still had the same issues as before. After basically trying everything, I went back to the old BIOS and did a clean install of the drivers, and guess what, everything works just fine again.

I found some other users with the same issue as well, but I believe most of the RX 5600 XT owners don't seem to have an issue with the updated BIOS. The only conclusion I can get out of this is that it's clear that not all RX 5600 XT cards are stable enough with the higher clockspeeds of the updated BIOS. 

I would like to get some AMD official acknowledgement that they are aware of this issue, as it is quite a big deal. I paid quite some money for this card, but I only bought this card knowing that the BIOS would be available from day 1 for higher performance (reviews did show that the updated bios of the cards did improve the performance of these cards quite a bit, believe it was around 10%). I basically feel screwed about this + my dealer says the card is doing fine as it's working ok on the original BIOS. In fact it's not ok, as the current advertised speed clocks are those from the new BIOS, but my card is not stable on those (p.s. I have a Corsair RM750i psu which should be plenty quality to run it).

Would be nice of AMD could officially acknowledge this, that I can take this to my dealer and ask for a refund or exchange of the card.",56,1583766189,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ffvz2e/rx_5600_xt_updated_bios_is_not_always_stable/,Amd,1

I looked online at various benchmarks and reviews, but I can't seem to get a cut and dry answer to what would be an upgrade over my 7700k since my chip is still a decent contender on its last leg.

  


I do both gaming and AutoCAD. I mainly use a 4k monitor for both gaming and AutoCAD. I also do some work from home stuff mainly with Excel.

  


Also to note, my 7700k was definitely a lower end chip, I did not win the silicone lottery with this chip, it ran crazy hot stock and could pretty much not do any overclocking. I got it stable at 4.6 with around 1.35v (I know thats high) I ended up deliding it and running direct die just to get ok temps with an AIO.",39,1583757178,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fftyeu/looking_to_upgrade_my_7700k/,Amd,1
fftxw1,Aurora_Sylphy,Ryzen 5 1600af or 3600,"Hi all. Might seem like a weird question, but I was thinking of upgrading my cpu. I do a bit of editing and actively use Adobe Photoshop, Premier Pro and After Effects, and then mainly gaming. My current set-up works fine with my Ryzen 5 2400g, but I was thinking of upgrading the CPU.

My current specs by the way are

Ryzen 5 2400g  
GTX 1070 TI FE  
Corsair Vengence LPX 3200mhz (2x8gb)  
Gigabyte A320 motherboard.  
1440p monitor (60Hz refresh rate)

Now in Austrailia from PCCaseGear, I can get the 1600af for like $150 AUD, and the 3600 for around $290 AUD. As far as I can tell from looking online, it seems the 1600af and then 1070ti will pose little to no bottleneck in general (perhaps outside the case of some very CPU dependent titles), and that the 3600 would be better suited to be paired with an GTX1080 or RTX 2070 or 2080 instead. I would assume in most cases I wouldn't see that much fps difference since there is either no bottleneck in general (with the 1600af) or with a GPU bottleneck with the 3600.

I am just wondering given all that if it even makes sense to get the 3600 when I can get the 1600af for about half the price (and the fact that is basically is a 2600 with a slight under-clock), I am wondering if it's even worth paying the extra 140 for the 360. Selling my old 2400g would also recoup most of the cost of the 1600af regardless, as opposed to the 3600 upgrade.

The main reason for the upgrade is I noticed in some more CPU bound titles (like AC Odyssey to mention one) my 4 physical cores is kind of hurting my performance, and so the bump up to six cores is my main reason for wanting an upgrade.",15,1583757108,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fftxw1/ryzen_5_1600af_or_3600/,Amd,1

fftuy5,sphyNx669,Custom fan curve for Gigabyte Aorus RX 5700 XT?,"Hey, y'all! Hope you are doing good!  


I would love to hear your opinions on AMD's automatic fan curve as I believe it prioritizes noise levels over thermals. The max fan speed is set to 42% by default and I believe that this is a bit low for this rather heavy gaming card.  The problem is when I run heavy games like AC Oddysey and Shadow of the Tomb Raider for more than 30 minutes -  the GPU gets toasty and it either shuts down the game or the PC entirely and closes and reopens the Radeon Software. I am certain it is due to the GPU because I tried overclocking and lowering the voltages by a minimal amount earlier and I was getting the same crashes with the software restart. (This card does not like to be tampered with at all).  I am providing a screenshot of the default fan settings set by AMD. Do you have any suggestions for a custom fan curve? I would appreciate it if you point the temperature and its respective fan speed for each of the 5 levels. (P1 - P5)

This is the ring that I have going:

  
CPU: Ryzen 5 3600X  
GPU: Gigabyte Aorus RX 5700 XT 8 GB  
MBD: Gigabyte B450 Aorus Pro  
RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3200MHz

I had a query on the Xbox game pass codes that I received from AMD for purchasing qualifying CPU and GPU on separate occasions.

Thing is, I have already redeemed and enjoyed 3 months of Xbox Game Pass subscription with the code I received for buying a Radeon GPU.

Now, I've read the following in AMD website:  
**Game Pass code must be  redeemed by June 30, 2020. Limit one promotional 3-month subscription  per Microsoft account over a 12-month period. Requires the Xbox (beta)  app and Windows 10 (with updates).**  

Now, the Game Pass code that I received with the CPU (not yet used), can I redeem it like I did before with the GPU? And, this is not any individual game code, but rather a whole library of games, so, is the redeemable period really till June 30 2020 or rather March 30 2020?

While there will be defo improvement of performance with Zen2 over Zen the Vega 64 LC Vs 5700XT might not be that great but I am running 3440x1440 100hz and Vega is starting to struggle on High/Ultra, tried to OC/UV but it won't budge one way or another. Extra RAM is just a back up as they are not making them kits I have already I wanted to buy them to have same kit. 

I am afraid prices will sky rocket and will not be able to buy stuff with those prices for much longer. 1600X and Vega 64 LC will go for sale so might get some money back or at least 75% the cost of 5700XT.

I AM SO SICK OF THESE DRIVER ISSUES, every time i load up a game after i turn my pc off over night, my games just load into a black screen, the only way to fix this from hours of my time spent messing around with loads of settings is by turning off Freesync, which I refuse to do as I spent so much money on my freesync monitor and nobody should have to put up with these jank driver problems in the first place.

Hopefully, someone from AMD sees this and uses this information to help resolve the issue. Also, when I turn off freesync i dont just get screen-tearing which is to be expected, i get some weird form of 'white-ghosting' which is wear the outline of objects in 3d rendered games glows white when moving the mouse.

ffq6fa,dipshit8304,"New build, just a few issues","Okay. Just built my first ever PC, and after a few weeks of getting things to where I want them to be, I still have a couple issues I need to sort out (mainly related to acoustics). For reference, here are my specs:

CPU: Ryzen 5 3600 (stock cooler)
Motherboard: MSI B450 Tomahawk Max
GPU: XFX DD Ultra RX 5700
RAM: 16GB G.SKILL Ripjaws V 3600MHz CL 16
Storage: 1. Kingston A2000 NVMe M.2 drive (500GB)
                2. Seagate Barracuda HDD (2TB)
PSU: Corsair CX650M (650W, 80+ bronze)
Case: CoolerMaster MB511
Case fans: CoolerMaster R4-S2S-124K-GP 44.73 CFM 120mm

Okay, now onto what I actually need to do:

1. I'd like to minimize noise from fans in my system. Right now, it's pretty loud, even idle, when I'm browsing the web or something. I'm sure a big part of it is my CPU fan, as I'm just using the stock Wraith Stealth cooler that came with my 3600, but it still seems louder than I expected, especially since my friend just bought a prebuilt that came with a 2700x, and that cooler is damn near silent. Any explanation as to why the cooler is so loud, or advice as to what I can do to fix it would be greatly appreciated. The other part is case fans. I bought some cheapo fans from CoolerMaster (4 for $16), just to get my build up and running decently. They're even advertised as quiet fans (19.6db), and typically run at 700-800rpm. Again, the stock fans that came with my friend's prebuilt are barely audible even if you put your ear against the front mesh, and mine are loud from 5 feet away. Any advice and/or reasoning as to how to improve volume would be greatly appreciated.

2. My GPU seems to have cool whine, which is pretty noticable, especially when I use the scroll whell on my mouse. I'd rather not RMA it if I can avoid it, partially because it's a pain, and partially because that's no guarantee that the problem will be fixed (if I'm wrong, let me know). I've heard that applying hot glue or a non-acidic silicone gel to the whiny coil can fix this issue, but I'd like to know if it's safe, and how to do it, and/or if there are other ways to fix this.

Reason upside down doesn't require trimming is because the top m.2 slot is leftward, but the bottom one is rightward, and the heatsink is for the top slot.",1,1583731936,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ffpxih/to_all_those_that_own_a_crosshair_7_hero/,Amd,1

ffojer,Bean_from_accounts,Sapphire RX 5600XT on Ubuntu 19.10,"Hi,

I've built my first rig over the weekend with my dad (R5 3600, Asus Prime X570-P, Sapphire RX 5600XT), and I later partitioned the ssd for dual-booting on Windows and Ubuntu. However, the installation of Ubuntu didn't work at first. For that, I used a bootable usb key with the latest LTS release (18.04) but the screen went black after the Ubuntu logo showed up. I later learned that this might have been due to not disabling the ""secure boot"" option in the BIOS.

None the wiser, I lowered my expectations and installed Ubuntu 16.04. It worked: there was a display, although the resolution seemed to be stuck at 1024\*768. From there, I upgraded from the command line. In fact, I did twice; First to the 18.04 release then a second time to 19.10 when I noticed the first upgrade didn't solve the resolution issue, and because most of the people who managed to get this GPU to run on Linux seem to have installed this development version of Ubuntu. Now I can change the resolution to the native screen resolution and the graphics card appears properly (as ""Navi 10"" instead of ""llvm"") in the system info.

But why does it ""work""? 

Is it just because it's the latest release and as such benefits from the newest advances in terms of drivers? I cannot find any proprietary driver for this particular GPU on Sapphire's website (for Linux distros) so does anyone know where the information can be found? 

Also, I know this is kind of a separate question but I'm really struggling to find where in the BIOS I can access information about the GPU. If anyone knows, I'd be happy to learn.

But when playing games like Control I get a low FPS, Sometimes as low as 35 even though an normal RX 570 at high settings should get around 48 FPS... But then I noticed the GPU's clock speed is at around 1030 MHz at normal power limit, 1168 MHz at +50% power limit...

ffk2wp,Allonsyyy_,HELP! PC keeps restarting when playing games,"Hi all,

Over the last 2 weeks my PC has been consistently restarting when playing various games.

I previously thought it was a CPU problem and upgraded and updated BIOS however the issue still happens. I have reset my RAM sticks and updated my GPU drivers.

At one point I noticed one of my HDD’s go to 100% but it was brief and I’ve noticed it now no longer renders footage in Premiere Pro properly where it used to.

For the first time today on one occasion it went to a blue screen which said: “Your PC needs to be repaired. Error code: 0xc000000e”

I’m at my wits end and starting to consider just selling the parts and buying a new build.

If anyone can help please do throw some suggestions my way!

ffjegp,Knightfal-SC,I can't help feeling a big UGH when it comes to AMD,"Let me start by saying, I am a pretty ardent supporter of AMD and have only built AMD systems since the FX6500 / RX290x represented the best bang for the buck.  However, it's painfully clear that while they are innovating their corporate butts off, they always seem to be two steps behind market relevance.  A few days ago AMD revealed at the investor conference the importance of the HEDT GPU market and yet they have been promising HEDT GPU since Vega.  Yes, we got the stopgap VII and the incremental 5700xt.  But so much of me wants to see them not just take on the competition but knock one out of the park.   

Maybe, it's my impatience at hearing we have to wait till 4th quarter 2020 for a 2080ti competitive card (that's been out over a year already.)  Maybe, it's my hyper awareness of the market and not much is going to happen from day to day except my awareness that the dreams of a top tier AMD build are still far off into the future.  I don't know man, it sucks.

The tech we will see then is first being marketed to the consoles.  The PC'ers being the few, consolers being the many. It makes sense, unfortunately, to keep the investors happy with healthy dividends and development salaries flowing.  But to this average PC nut, it feels like we are always the last in line.",11,1583702558,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ffjegp/i_cant_help_feeling_a_big_ugh_when_it_comes_to_amd/,Amd,1

I've bought a 3900x at launch and there was a ton of infos, always saying the opposite of what was supposed to be true 2 days before.  


I've decided to let the dust settle and optimize my 3900 later.

  
I'm still struggling to find the ""definitive"" way of setting it up. A lot of info is either old or gets debunked on another post, and I don't really know what I'm supposed to do anymore.

Would you guys have some info to share by any chance ?  


Here is my config :

**GPU : MSI GeForce GTX 1080Ti Gaming X, 11 Go**  
**CPU : AMD Ryzen 3900x**  
**AiO : Corsair H115i Platinum**  
**Motherboard : Asus Crosshair VIII HERO**  
**Ram : G.Skill TridentZ 16 Go DDR4 3200MHz CAS14**

I currently have an rtx2060 and a 3600x

From a previous experience 3 years ago I upgraded from a 1070 to a 1080ti with not that much improvement when playing on low graphic settings, I learned later that CPU was quite important when playing on low settings, GPU load is low and CPU load is usually higher than GPU load,
(That PC is gone now so let's forget about it)

So I'm wondering if there's any real improvement picking one of those CPUs over what I have now (3600X - 2060)

As I said, newer games work flawlessly, Modern Warfare is smooth as hell and so is the new Tomb Raider trilogy, so I assumed the problem isn't on my end. Some DX11 games like Star Wars: Battlefront are also smooth.

I've read that currently, AMD drivers are very singlethreaded when they handle DX11 or older games with lots of draw calls, which isn't ideal given that the first Zen CPUs weren't that great in that area. Is this fixable in the drivers or is this a hardware issue ? I'd love to know more from people with more knowledge on the matter than me.

ffbqcz,BBA935,"My findings and a workaround for the ""Black Screen"" bug with AMD cards","I installed the latest drivers last night and they seem worse than the previous drivers. I'm was still getting random black screens on my desktop. In Overwatch everything seems fine. Tried Doom 2016 and eventually got a black screen using the Vulkan API. I uninstalled the driver and my PC was fine using the generic driver, but obviously that is not ideal. The problem seemed to become less frequent if you tune down your PC in Windows via Power Management from Performance to a lesser setting, but nobody wants to do this.

**Solution**

The thing that keyed me off was that Overwatch didn't have a problem. The difference was that I have the refresh rate set to 90Hz in game so that Freesync will work. I then Right clicked on my Desktop &gt; Display Settings &gt; Advanced Display Settings &gt; Display Adapter Settings For Display 1 &gt; Monitor Tab &gt; I then changed my refresh rate from 144Hz to 90Hz.

This completely resolved the Black Screen issue as of the time of this post. I know it's not ideal, but until AMD puts a real effort into resolving this bug that has been around for months, this is the next best thing. I figured this out in a few days from installing the card and this becoming a problem. AMD has far more resources and knowledge than I have, so what does that tell you?

ffbcym,Koriel_,2700x not boosting beyond 3.7Ghz on all-core loads?,"So I recently got a build made of:

\-Gigabyte's B450M DS3H

\-Ryzen 7 2700x (stock Wraith prism cooler)

\- 2x8Gb Corsair Vengeance LPX 3000 C15

\-Corsair VS650w  


The thing is, on light workloads, the processor will boost to 4.3ghz no problem, looking something like this:

But as soon as I hit it with any kind of multi-thread load, like a Blender render, from the very first second, all cores drop and seem to lock at 3.7ghz:

Thing is, the temperatures don't get to reach even 70º degrees, in the bios precision boos is set to auto, so... what am I missing? I do have extra power, temperature headroom...   


Any ideas of what am I missing? I thought it was pretty fine to have sustained loads at 4 ghz at least.

ff5wnr,KomputerIdiat,Is it normal for RX 580 8GB or just GPUs to Have Biggest Trouble in Rendering Shadows?,"Hi Guys,  

I'm not sure if this is normal, but are RX580 8GBs terrible at maintaining high shadow quality in games? I play games on the highest settings majority of the times with my 1680X1050 60HZ monitor and two games so far have shown FPS bottle necks at shadow quality. One for Witcher 3 and the other is Dishonored 2. I have fiddled nearly with everything with my vertical sync on and the one setting that can help me gain lower or gain 22 fps is by tuning up or down the shadow quality. Ambient Occlusion does raise or lower by 3-5 fps but shadow is definitely the greater determinant. No other settings can raise or lower the fps like shadow quality. 
 
Witcher 3 can maintain a steady 60fps when I just lower the shadow all the way to the minimum while maintaining everything else maxed through out 99.99% of the game with exceptions in Skellige when the weather is acting up, and you have to be in the dense forest. I remember this lowers my fps with V sync on by 10 the most. I am least affected by this setting because I cannot see the differences in shadows at all when I tune this. I can't perceive the differences at all on my monitor even when I squint or push my head closer to the monitor. The game is gorgeous regardless.
 
Dishonored 2 can maintain 60fps if I make the shadow medium when I just pulled the lever to elevate a clockwork soldier out in Jindosh's mansion. However, the shadows is very discernible in their quality in between medium and high. High and Very High is less but noticeable, and Very High to Ultra is much less so. This actually bothers me because the game looks noticeably worse when the shadows lowers to medium range.  
 
Is this normal for the RX 580 8GB? Do other 580 8GB owners have the same issues?

It also gets ~5% lower than average in PassMark, and Userbenchmark reports my 3600 as being in the second percentile for all 3600s tested, which obviously is abysmal. I am using the stock cooler, have PBO enabled, and other than that, have not modified stock settings at all. I don't think that I am thermally throttling, bc temps stayed at about 75-85°C during all of my benchmarking, and the 3600 doesn't start to throttle until 95°C. I am running my motherboard's latest BIOS. I think that the issue may be related to a low boost clock, because Userbenchmark reports my average boost clock speed at 3.95GHz, as opposed to the advertised 4.2.

ff0ih7,p1msalab1m,Still getting black screens on 20.2.2,"  

Hi guys,

So after reading the patch notes I was really happy and excited to test the new drivers. I built my first PC (Ryzen 5 3600 + Sapphire Pulse RX 5700) in the beginning of this year and I have not been able to play a single game on it because of the black screens I am getting. I have tried almost every driver from 2019 and now also from 2020. Always using the AMD Cleanup Utility. But no luck so far, not even on the new 20.2.2 driver.

The black screens seem to be only during gaming (Anthem, Destiny 2, Rainbow Six Siege, Apex Legends and Star Wars Battlefront 2). Web browsing, watching videos etc. are fine, only when I start up a game it will crash on me. Sometimes right of the bat and sometimes I am able to play +/-20 mins before my first black screen or system hang. My only option is to reboot and try again (with the same results).

Steps I have taken so far:

\- I have tried to turn of Freesync.

\- I checked my thermals (my GPU only reaches 70 degrees at its max and my CPU around 60).

\- I have no overclock and have no experience with overclocking.

\- I have turned off hardware acceleration on Chrome and Discord

My 30 days of return are expired and I am afraid that if I RMA my card it will just be sent back because ""it works fine in their system"". Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am really desperate and have no clue what to do.

I’m a very casual streamer but stream my world of Warcraft raiding for friends and some people drop in from our realm. 

I was using an Nvidia 1070 and would get a really high quality 1080p 60fps stream at 3000bitrate using the hardware GPU codec. 

Since I’ve built my new pc which is a lot more powerful my stream is dreadful. Using software or the GPU hardware codec my stream is grainy and just generally not good enough. 

Done some googling and see a general broad comment AMD cards are poor in terms of encoders or something. 

Is this something that can be fixed from AMD driver updates or is it just a case I can’t stream at my old quality anymore now that I went AMD.  

Appreciate any help or assistance. Really do enjoy streaming even though it’s at a low level and it’s a pity moving to a 400+ euro card can’t match a 3 year old cards performance

feur1c,retardedkiddo99rus,Making (almost) best vega even better [WARNING TO LIMITED-TRAFFIC USERS: LOT OF IMAGES],"Hi everyone. My first card was a Sapphire X1950PRO. I remember playing the first NFSMW at highest possible settings with smooth fps. What a time.

Later then my card collected so many dust that fan got stuck, i did not knew anything about PC's, ignored those artifacts/shutdowns and eventually it died. I think that it was a kickstart for my PC enthusiasm.

Later then i got a GT220, then 550Ti (also died), then 1050Ti, 1066ASUSTURBO and here i am with Nitro+ Vega56 (Non-LE).

It serviced me nice for over a year until i tried to hot-unplug the DP&lt;-&gt;VGA active converter... Both displays gone black, fans gone 110% RPM. I had that before while plugging in the same adapter but nothing bad happened. But not this time.

This time card died. Not like completely but i couldn't install any driver version or run any intensive 3D task. Had to RMA the card and get the Nitro+ RX5700XT.

5700XT was a disaster. Black screens: not so often. First driver installation, both displays gone black. After a reboot i saw that driver was installed successfully and had no black screens for like solid 2 months. Only got it once or two during PUBG session (HW-accelerated Firefox was running a video on my second display). Everything else: ramped up memory clocks to 1750mhz @ 144hz, plus 12 degrees memory temp because of that, 105 degree hotspot at +20% power limit, green artifacts in PUBG while moving the mouse (boost was disabled, antilag enabled, RIS also enabled). About the card: its not as solid as the nitro+vega was. It sags. Fun fact: with vega i also got a brace support bracket; with 5700 i got nothing. What a shame. Oh and i also contacted local sapphire support and asked about those problems plus another one with a flashing RGB. They said 'test it on another pc and if problem occurs - RMA it'. And that's what i did, month later. (note: i have not tested 20.2.2 but i'm going to)

Few weeks ago i get SMS about my vega - local shop successfully repaired it. Warranty expired by now so i got another card to experiment with. RX5700XT is going back to the local seller as sapphire told me to do. Two weeks later they called and told me that they got no problems with it, i don't get any moneyback for the shipping and card is going back to me. Are they blind or what...? [https://imgur.com/a/L0Dmzba](https://imgur.com/a/L0Dmzba) (thanks to [/user/hahayeahok/](https://www.reddit.com/user/hahayeahok/) for the video).

Now i got two cards to experiment with. While RX5700XT is going back to me, get my little how to make a ice cold vega.

First attempt was a partial success. I don't know what exact thermal paste local seller used but results were bad (for such an expensive and heavy card)

![img](xivxe4hll8l41 ""Sorry for the quality. I lost the original one. 61° gpu, 100° hotspot, 64° memory temps. Awful, very awful result."")

feshp4,nahpungnome,Tried using Ryzen Master for my 3900x,"So I went off of the guide here  [https://community.amd.com/thread/244684](https://community.amd.com/thread/244684)  and settled on 4350mhz all core @ 1.3v.  I was able to get 4375mhz @ 1.325v, but I didn't think it was worth the extra .025v for 25mhz all core, but please correct me if  I'm wrong.

When I set everything to auto, I'd have voltage all over the place when idling from 1.1v to 1.4+v.  CPU temp would idle around 41 to 44C, whereas with these settings I actually go below 40C once in a while.  

The idle temps seem jumpy at idle after replacing my Wraith RGB with a Scythe Fuma 2.  The Fuma 2 gave a better load temp vs my Wraith at 74C vs 84C when running CPUz stress test with everything on auto.  

With the below settings running the same CPUz stress test, I hover around 68C.  I don't know my ambient temps at the time of measurement though, so they may not be 100% scientific in that regard, but the weather has been consistent the last few night's that I've ran these tests.

The orange bar on the cinebench was when I was at 4375mhz where I ran over 7600, since clocking down to 4350mhz I'm slightly under 7600 consistently.

I'm not sure if there's any more room for improvement here, but if there's something to try, please let me know. I'm not really interested in running all the way to the limit, which is why I backed down from the stable 4375mhz 1.325v setting.

fes8lg,luisguerreiro,Questions about AIO watercooling the XFX Vega 56 (Also questions about my current overclock on ref),"So, bought a used Vega 56 and I'm loving it, but the heat is extreme, and the cooling solution sucks... I need to use a aggressive fan curve, even then, hbm temps are always above 70 so I'm pretty sure the timings are tightening...Therefore, I'm thinking about a cheap AIO solution (Deepcool Gammax L240) and a g12, getting the morpheus ii doesn't sound like a good idea, with the l240, I can at least use it with the processor or with my next vga (Planning on waiting for big navi and next nvidia gen). So my question is, will the hbm be properly cooled from that solution?

Now about my current setting, I'm running the 56 with Vega 64 bios, didn't mess with the p7 core of 1630, just the voltage (1020mV now), and got the Samsung HBM to 1000mhz (Still going for more, just didn't feel like tweaking), getting 19000 in firestrike, which is pretty awkward considering my temps are mostly ok (core is between 70-80 on load), so are the loosening timings of the samsung causing this performance issues?Or my score is normal for my current settings (Or my uv/oc sucks?)",1,1583568443,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fes8lg/questions_about_aio_watercooling_the_xfx_vega_56/,Amd,1

Yesterday, while gaming, I was getting around 78c GPU and 84c HBM2 at 90% fans which made me curious that if the 5-10c increase in ambient temperature in 2 months is the result of this. But I instead suspected that something is wrong with the paste, and yes it was dried up :D and most of it was left was just a watery grease.

I only had a few drops of NT-H1 left, so instead of cleaning the paste, I just took the leftover paste around the die and spread it with the card again.  


Now the temps are back to normal at 1630/1100 @ 1025mv

fernwk,SpeeedyLight,AMD Driver 20.2.2 Blue Screen Update. Previous Overclocks/Undervolts are irrelevant,"Firstly kinda disappointed that AMD had to delete my last post where a lot of users also experienced similar issues like me with the new driver update.

Anyways New driver update makes your card consume higher power so all your previous profiles are irrelevant , You'll have to find your best OC/UV settings again. Which is not that big of a deal except previously when you undervolted too much all you had to face was a GPU crash and within a few seconds your GPU would reboot while everything else stayed as it is. But now you get BOSD . 

0 RPM mode didn't work but now it does work some times.

Another issue I have is AMD relive will only capture audio if i have my default audio set to AMD High Definition Audio Device for which i have to connect my headphone's to my monitor's audio port with inferior audio quality than my Motherboard audio output.

A thing to note, the new driver gives me higher clock speeds on my RX 5700 but my FPS seem's to be about the same. The difference in clocks is huge though. MY rx 5700 used to jump between 1200-1900 Mhz now it stays at 1930-1934 Mhz (Yes just between these 5 frequencies) it almost feels like it's forced to stay at this clock while not delivering on any performance improvement or maybe the previous frequency reporting was just incorrect and it was running at 1900 Mhz+ .

Anyways to be concrete on my speculations I will conduct some performance test with 20.2.2 vs previous driver edition and post here when i'm done.",10,1583564521,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fernwk/amd_driver_2022_blue_screen_update_previous/,Amd,1

I have 3x VisionTek 7750 cards in a HP workstation. 2 of the cards are in x16 PCIe slots and one is in a x8; both AMD, VisionTek and HP confirmed this is supported. 

Windows detects all 3 cards; Windows can even ""See"" all 18 monitors connected to it (mDP to HDMI cables). However, only a handful will activate to 1080p, a handful are stuck at 800x600 and a handful will not activate at all!

I've tried generic drivers, AMD drivers... nothing! Same results. When I try to extend a desktop to one of the ""Disabled"" monitors, it simply says ""unable to save display settings."" Those that are stuck 800x600 - the drop down to change resolution is grayed out. 

The monitors are all identical (it's a Christie monitor wall system)... so not sure whats going on.

feks09,Clockwork21R,Still having black screen &amp; restarts while gaming? Check power supply idle control!,"TL;DR

If you still having black screens, followed by sudden restarts (with NO BSOD) while trying to play ANY GAME, with no solution on SOFTWARE side, do not use PSU LOW CURRENT IDLE in bios settings. I changed it to Auto and all problems went away. 

Hello guys.

My system is a Ryzen 3600x with RX VEGA 56 (water-cooled). 

I was trying to understand why my pc suddenly started to give black screens and many many restarts within minutes of gaming for just a few minutes. 

I was initially blaming the drivers as it all started at the beginning of December, when the new drivers game out for the graphics card.

I literally tried EVERYTHING regarding settings in the radeon settings and every driver out there. DDU several times, I stalling drivers through device manager without the adrenalin programm etc but nothing solved my prb. 

Since nothing seemed to fix it, I started thinking it may have been a hardware issue. I reseated my gpu, ram and even unplugged and re plugged everything. Still the problem persisted.

I then thought perhaps my ram oc was culprit, even though it felt weird having a stable system for so long and suddenly having this breakdown with no reason. Hence I decided to switch my bios to default settings, restarted and.. Voila!

Everything worked fine, so what I did is trying to scale down my timings a little bit, while going back to my other non essential (as I thought back then) bios settings. Guess what, problem was back again! So tried to run ram at default.. Same thing!

I was about to go nuts and was about to RMA the card as I could not find a solution to a problem for 3 fucking months. Last resort I changed again bios settings to default and only applied my RAM OC back. No problems whatsoever. So I tried to think what else did I change in December in my bios settings that fucked up everything. Then I remembered I used usmus power plan along with the suggested changes in the bios, one of which was psu idle control in low current mode. I reverted back to auto and all problems gone!

I dunno if thats the solution to all of whom are still having problems with radeon cards, even after the latest updates but give it a go.

[https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/consumer/pulse-radeon-rx-5600-xt-6g-gddr6](https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/consumer/pulse-radeon-rx-5600-xt-6g-gddr6)

and I noticed the BIOS version says 1.03, but still with the old date. I still have 1.02 on my drive, so I downloaded 1.03 version and I noticed the ""right"" (performance) BIOS is now different, with date of 2020-25-02, the 1.02 performance BIOS was 2020-01-17. Comparing the file contents show differences between these two files, while the ""left"" (silent) BIOS remains the same.

Does anyone have any information about it? The website doesn't say anything and I can't google more information about it.

Thanks.

(btw I updated the BIOS and it works exactly as before)",4,1583518818,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fehnkk/sapphire_5600xt_secret_bios_103_february_update/,Amd,1
fehbg5,Daimler_KKnD,SPECULATION: PS5 and RT/RDNA2,"I watched AMD Financial Analyst Day presentation and it felt really strange, it's almost like they avoided saying whether Sony's console is RDNA1 or RDNA2. When specifically talking about Sony and MS they would always mention simply RDNA. Many assume that when David Wang was talking about RT implementation in RDNA2 and said it will be common for next-generation consoles, that he meant RDNA2 will be used in all consoles. But for me it felt like he was referring to RT implementation, not RDNA2 architecture. So for me it seems that they have confirmed PS5 will have the same RT acceleration technology implemented as in SB SX and RDNA2. But at the same time they confirm it was a joint effort between AMD and Microsoft, so how did it end up in Sony's console? This made me wondering about all the past leaks and rumors... And here is the theory that makes most sense for me now. Just want to share it and keep on record here for future generations :)

&amp;#x200B;

So remember in one of the first reliable leaks about next-gen XBox and Playstation in beginning of 2019 (with specs that were proved to be true later on) leaker mentioned a few interesting things about PS5 ([https://imgur.com/gallery/i3TnTKk](https://imgur.com/gallery/i3TnTKk)):

\- 8+ TFlops

\- He doesn't know if PS5 will have RT

\- PS5 was supposed to be launched in 2019, but was delayed for unknown reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on several other leaks confirmed that PS5 was delayed for rework. And I think based on all info known so far that the following happened:

1) Sony was co-developing Navi architecture (RDNA1) with AMD (there were leaks that Navi is joint-venture between AMD and Sony) with target of 8TFlops, which would have been enough to beat all existing consoles including One X and provide twice as much performance as PS4 Pro, while maintaining backwards compatibility (GCN execution units in RDNA1). And the launch date was set to Holiday season of 2019 to be at least 1 year ahead of Microsoft and beat them to next-gen.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Everything was more or less on track and I believe Sony already had some engineering samples of their chips in late 2018. However this is were things went south. Previously I thought that it was AMD who botched up the PS5 launch by failing to deliver working Navi graphics (like it had architecture bugs, low clock and high power consumption). But now I believe it was something else entirely - during the year of 2018 Sony saw the release of DirectX with RT support by Microsoft, then launch of nVidia RTX cards and most probably got news from their insider sources at AMD that the next-gen XBox GPU is at least 50% faster and has baked-in RT support.

&amp;#x200B;

3) So my idea is that by the end of 2018 Sony new that their Navi based chip even if released in 2019, will become completely obsolete in 2020 and not even considered next-gen because of how big of a gap there will be both performance-wise and feature-wise between PS5 and XB SX. All AAA games would look miles better on XB SX with RT, which would be a disaster for Sony, potentially bigger than PS3.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Sony makes the only sensible decision - to postpone launch and make changes in the architecture to decrease the gap and implement at least RT acceleration. It is late 2018 and if they target for the Holiday 2020 launch together with next BX then it would mean they had to have a working final chip no later than beginning of 2020, so they practically had around 1 year to implement the necessary changes into already built Navi architecture, tape out and validate. From engineering perspective it is close to impossible. But they go to AMD anyway and ask if their engineers can increase the clock rates to improve TFlops and implement RT into their core within the next year. AMD would probably say that clock rate could be possible, but RT definitely not. Because RT implementation that they were already building is co-developed with Microsoft and they would need to engineer something completely new from ground up for Sony, which will take way more than 1 year and also will cost them probably the same amount of money as it cost to build original Navi based chip.

&amp;#x200B;

5) So situation is on a brink of disaster and what options Sony have? They could have postponed the launch even further to Holiday 2021 and build a new chip, that could potentially be still slower than XB SX and a year too late, so still a very risky move. And I think what Sony decides is to go to Microsoft and try to make a deal on RT architecture to implement into their chip and launch in 2020 alongside XB.

&amp;#x200B;

6) I think after lengthy negotiations MS agrees to strike a deal with Sony and license their RT technology. Why would MS do that? First of all because they would be making money on each PS5 sold, secondly if both consoles have the same RT tech then multiplatform game developers would surely use it without any additional incentive required from MS (in a scenario when PS would not have RT support at all) and because MS knows their XB SX is still more powerful than PS5 - these games will still look better on their console. But that is not all! Remember when out of the blue in May 2019 MS and Sony announce partnership and collaboration in Cloud and use of MS platform to power Playstation Now. It sounded like something completely unbelievable back then, but now it makes total sense - as part of the deal to use Microsoft's tech by Sony in next-gen console. So Microsoft secured a huge amount of profits to be made from Sony over coming years. And this is only what lies on the surface, there could be even more parts of this deal that we won't ever even know about.

&amp;#x200B;

7) So what Sony got in this deal? They did save their face and potentially averted disaster that PS5 could have been. And of course got access to some top-tier technologies that probably cost hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. It is still not clear what exactly MS have licensed until Sony makes PS5 reveal, but I see 2 main options (with first one being more probable):

\- MS gave rights to use only RT cores design in Sony's own Navi-based chip.

\- or MS gave permission to use whole RDNA2 architecture, with all features like VRS, AI, etc. However definitely with some size/performance restrictions, for example - no more than 40CUs (or something like that) to ensure that XB SX would still be superior.

&amp;#x200B;

8)  So Sony has been fiercely working together with AMD on the PS5 chip design change in the past 9-12 months, which is still quite small amount of time for chip architecture redesign. And I suspect that they have encountered problems implementing RT or RDNA2, which is the reason why they still did not make the announcement of final specs and design. 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, my conclusion is that PS5 is going to use Microsoft developed RT acceleration cores (either in some kind of RDNA1.5 architecture or in full blown RDNA2) via licensing deal with MS/AMD, but it will still be slower than XB SX and potentially will have release date pushed even further (Q1-Q2 2021) until the new chip is tested and ready for production.",17,1583517538,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fehbg5/speculation_ps5_and_rtrdna2/,Amd,1
feh181,deathpacito_3,Does ryzen 7 2700 support multi GPU setup ?,"Hello, I'm a 3D artist, I use Cinema4D with Octane Render and my doubt is whether I can use a multi GPU Setup (Non - SLI). Octane render can use multiple GPUs despite of different GPUs used.

My PC specification ~
Processor - AMD Ryzen 7 2700
GPU - Galax GTX 1080
Motherboard - Gigabyte Aurous Elite B450M

So my doubt here is I've decided to use RTX card in companion with my GTX 1080 for 2 reasons -
1. RTX cards RT features helps in Octane Renderer
2. RTX Cards give better performance with new update of Octane 

So I'll be using one my card as primary one (for monitor) and second one for only rendering. (Gaming is not priority so don't recommend to go with SLI and my motherboard doesn't even support SLI anyways).

So my doubt is it possible to run Two Different GPUs on my motherboard and Processor ?",11,1583516431,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/feh181/does_ryzen_7_2700_support_multi_gpu_setup/,Amd,1

We're giving you an opportunity to start reporting some of your AMD-related technical issues right here on /r/AMD! Below is a guide that you should follow to make the whole process run smoothly. Post your issues directly into this thread as replies. **All other tech support posts will still be removed, per the rules; this is the only exception.**

----------------------------------------------------

##Bad Example (don't do this)

&gt;  
bf1 crashes wtf amd

________________________________________

##Good Example (please do this)

&gt;Skyrim: Free Sync and V Sync causes flickering during low frame rates, and generally lower frame rates observed (about 10-30% drop dependant on system) when Free Sync is on
 
&gt;  
##System Configuration:  
**Motherboard:** GIGABYTE GA-Z97 Gaming GT  
**CPU:** Intel i5 4790  
**Memory:** 16GB GDDR5  
**GPU:** ASUS R9 Fury X  
**VBIOS:** 115-C8800100-101 [^^How ^^do ^^I ^^find ^^this?](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001309.htm)  
**Driver:** Crimson 16.10.3  
**OS:** Windows 10 x64 (1511.10586) [^^How ^^do ^^I ^^find ^^this?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system)

&gt;
##Steps to Reproduce:  
1\. Install necessary driver, GPU and medium-end CPU  
2. Enable Free Sync  
3. Set Options to Ultra and 1920 x 1080 resolution  
4. Launch game and move to an outdoor location  
5. Indoor locations in the game will not reproduce, since they generally give better performance  
6. Observe flickering and general performance drop  
&gt;
##Expected Behavior:
Game runs smoothly with good performance with no visible issues

&gt;
##Actual Behavior:
Frame rate drops low causing low performance, flickering observed during low frame rates

&gt;
##Additional Observations:

fee0qz,irr1449,"The reference 5700 is one of the best enthusiast graphics cards of all time, change my mind","Let me just preface this with the fact that my first GPU was a 3DFX Voodoo and I've never been team red guy.  I owned a few AMD cards (480, 290x, 295x2) but mostly stuck with team green since Pascal.   

I paid 279 on Black Friday for a ref 5700.  It was sort of an impulse buy, I already had a 1080 and 1080 ti.  When I first got the 5700 installed, I hated it.  I posted here about how horrible it was.  I told anyone that would listen not to buy one.  After I begrudgingly did a fresh windows install, I have not had a single issue.  

Why I'm saying that this is an enthusiast card is because you really need to put some work in to get the best out of it.  It's not hard, it just takes some tweaking.  You can easily flash the firmware to 5700 XT.  I was able to push my boost clock to around 2ghz with the memory at 1850mhz.  I have the max fan RPM set to 60% and I will settle out around 70c under full load.  This is slightly louder than aftermarket but not that much.    There is a huge difference between a blower card at 100% and 50-60%.  This is not a golden chip, it's fairly common as the 5700 is just a lower binned XT.

With the card dialed in its performance is within 5% of my old 1080 ti and crushes the 1080 by 20-25%

This is my favorite type of card because it represents a tremendous value if you're willing to put in the work.  There is nothing that can even come close to touching this card in value once it's tuned.  Used 1080s are going for the same price.   The cheapest new 2080 that you can buy right now is over 2x the price and offers maybe 3-5% more performance.   Even a true 5700 XT will be marginally faster only because of 4 extra CU's and MAYBE 100mhz higher clock speed if you're lucky.  

I hope AMD continues to offer similar types of cards in the future. (Soft locks on voltage, power, etc)  The average joe isn't going to jump through all these hoops to get the extra performance and it won't cannibalize the up market SKU's.",32,1583504014,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fee0qz/the_reference_5700_is_one_of_the_best_enthusiast/,Amd,1

I'm also not 100% on which voltage to use as some people have reported less performance by setting the voltage to something more reasonable than the MSI's default of 1.5v!

Hey guys,

I've been fiddling with my Ryzen 3600 lately, trying to optimize my case temps (NZXT Manta + CPU tower cooler) and CPU temps. My CPU cooler is a Cryorig R1 Universal.

In the process, I've tried undervolting and trying different PBO settings under Ryzen Master. Of course, your mileage may vary! Disclaimer: it is *summer* here, 30-35c ambient.

All measurements are made with Ryzen Master exclusively. My goals:

* Have temperatures well below the 70c range, *if possible* have synthetic tests @ 60c tops.
* Have an all-core voltage &lt; 1.31v as the general consensus is you should not exceed 1.325v on all-core workloads. I didn't care for the 'high idle voltages', as they don't seem dangerous.
* Keep frequencies as high as possible while doing so, don't kill FPS/bench score.

My conclusions:

* Set a **custom fan curve**. The CPU temps are ""jumpy"" at idle, so keep them @ low RPM until the 55c mark.
* **DO NOT set a fixed voltage** unless you really know what you're doing, as Ryzen CPUs manage every workload differently in terms of voltages. Doing so may cause long term damage to your CPU.
* Do not set a negative voltage offset, use PBO with AutoOC + lower PPT! PPT stands for the total socket power draw. By default this value is 88w on the 'smaller' Zen 2 CPUs (at least on the 3600).

I've tested a few PPT values, with a small spreadsheet and Cinebench + Prime95 + some gaming.

In my experience, setting PPT at 60w drastically reduced temps:

* 65c MAX @ Prime95 or Cinebench, 60c while gaming, while the boost clocks  SOMEHOW remained quite high (3.7ghz for Prime95, &gt;3.9ghz for all other loads).
* Prime95 voltage is 1.13v, Cinebench 1.28v, gaming voltages vary greatly because of core usage.
* FPS were the same. Cinebench score dropped from 3550 to 3480, so a \~2% decrease.

Lower than 60w, Prime95 would kill the boost frequency. Higher than 60w, Cinebench all-core voltages exceeded 1.325v. Of course, 88w had Prime95 @ +85c, Cinebench voltages \~1.35v.

To do this, simply go on your BIOS settings and look for PBO and PPT options. If not, use Ryzen Master on each boot, as RM doesn't save the settings post reboot.

So, my Cpu shows high temperatures when playing games and when just sitting on the home screen.  
Here's an image of my AMD Master (Hopefully you can make sense out of it) [https://imgur.com/5QEWEVw](https://imgur.com/5QEWEVw)  
On startup and sitting at the home screen it usually sits at around 50 - 60 (sometimes 45).  
While gaming though it goes up to 70 sometimes 80. I'm just a bit concerned as I see that other people's CPU's sit at a much lower temperature. I'm just hoping that their might be some setting I can change to lower the temp without loss of performance (I have put it on power saving mode and that has lowered it to 40-45 when on the home screen however, I get low fps in games).

fe8hx7,Rise_Above91,Looking for advice/opinions on an AMD build,"So my current PC is coming up on 4 years old and I'm looking to build a new gaming desktop around June time frame, as well as making the switch from Intel to AMD. Budget is $1500 - $2000, with the plan to upgrade to a Ryzen 4000 series CPU when they launch. Biggest thing is I'm not very savvy when it comes to MoBo and RAM specs and what I should buy/how much I should spend. Current parts list is as follows.

CPU: Ryzen 3600x

MoBo: ASUS ROG X570 Crosshair VIII Hero

RAM: G Skill Trident Z Neo (For AMD Ryzen) 32GB (2 x 16GB)

PSU: Corsair 850W

GPU: Undecided on at the moment, going to be looking at pricing/performance/new releases closer to build time.

Storage: Going to be using both an M.2 SSD (OS and a couple games) and a large capacity drive (either SSD or HDD for mass storage)

Cooling: AIO water cooler (undecided which one at this time)

Case: NZXT H710i

I am currently running 2 1440p 144hz monitors, with the plan to buy a third with this new build, I want to be able to play games at 1440p with as high of frames as possible (mostly CoD:MW) and the option to start breaking into VR (DCS mostly), as well as having the option to stream games without a performance drop. Looking for input on the MoBo and RAM specifically, keeping in mind that the CPU will be upgraded to Ryzen 4000 when they launch. 

For reference this is my current PC build

CPU: Intel 4790k

MoBo: ASUS Sabertooth Z97

RAM: G Skill Ripjaws X 16GB (2 x 8GB)

GPU: EVGA GTX 1070 FTW

Ever since I got my 5700XT, the main thing that I noticed is that the junction temp ramps up high for a few seconds like a bat out of hell - to 95, or even 100C.  I had to set a fan curve to keep my sanity.  This is even when undervolted a bit.

I upgraded to 20.2.2.  With the same profile, I lost a decent amount of performance.  I upped my profile for GPU clock and memory clock.  I get a couple fewer average FPS on AC:Odyssey, and about 100 points less on Time Spy GPU test.  T he delta between average temp and junction temp is a lot smaller, meaning that the fan doesn't go crazy every now and then.

fe80dz,JohanAke,Vega 56 to run cooler,"Ok, so here it goes. I have owned the AMD reference Vega 56 for a while and the power it has is really good for me. But one thing that bothers me is the noise it makes while gaming .I knew that it can be noisy when I bought it but I would like to make it run cooler/more silence while remaining the current effiency in games.

I have been thinking on getting Morpheus ii for it but it is pretty difficult to get in Europe atm and it is a bit expensive since I'm not looking to OC.

So the card is totally stock, no changes made to clocks/voltage and it is made by AMD, I bought it when it was first released. And I'm running Ubuntu.

So I have couple of questions, would I be able to flash it with Vega 64 bios and would that bring any value to my when I'm not really seeking OC? And that being said, to make it run cooler and be more silence, would the best bet just undervoltage the card and not raise clocks? And any tips on the fans, what would be the optimal fan curves in general?

I haven't been keeping up with the latest technology, but based on my initial research RAM speeds matter for gaming performance. It looks like the sweet spot for gaming and productivity is utilizing RAM speeds at 3600 MHz with a case latency of 16 or 17. Does this sound correct?

Anybody have recommendations for a RAM kit for me to choose? I'd like to grab something with a decent price that has a fairly tight cas latency. There are so many kits on Newegg with prices varying from 80 to 200. I thought this kit looked decent for the price. It has everything I want.

Well, I have a 5700 XT Pulse and with my GPU at 100% I get max 80C on Junction and \~65C on GPU with this curve (I have good airflow in my case)

(so my fans get to 100% after 78C on Junction)

I am a little scared by high temps, with my old RX 580 fans were going to 100% at 70C on GPU

So, what do you think that is the max safe junction temp for daily usage?

Not many people answered to that post, but those who did seemed to agree that the best should be the [PowerColor Red Dragon RX 5700](https://www.amazon.com/PowerColor-Dragon-5700-tarjeta-gráfica/dp/B07WRVWNMY/). But the reviews on amazon don't seem to think the same, even the new ones, It seems PowerColor has another 5700 model since then.  


Also, I would like to know if the 5700 keeps being the sweet spot when buying a good card, or if you'd recommend me go for an Nvidia, Wait or buy now, what's the current state of AMD's drivers, etc. I would like to hear your opinions.

fe2vdc,Timekeepsonslippin,"Regarding FreeSync, I had a short conversation with someone. Wondering about the accuracy of their statements. Feel free to chime in whether you feel they or I are right or wrong on the various points, and set the record straight.","**1.** **Them:** ""It's not free if you know people logically have no other choice but to buy AMD GPUs (at the time it was created) and developers of the individual hardware and software are burdened with the implementation. It's also just variable refresh rate changes, not actual frame sync coordination between the GPU display buffer and the display itself, like with GSync. AMD markets this as a good guy solution to a bad guy NVidia problem, but it's just a last-ditch and too cheap attempt not to lose more of the gaming market. Hell, NVidia's solution replaces the scalar with effectively a direct output from the graphics card so the GPU can drive the display directly rather than negotiate timings--which costs money and requires even more expensive licensing, but good things usually don't come free. 

Then NVidia started putting variable refresh displays and FreeSync displays into their GSync driver library. Nail, meet coffin.""

\---

**2. Me:** ""Admittedly I lack probably a lot of information when it comes to this subject, but I wish to share based on what little I've gleaned. When Nvidia started supporting Freesync monitors in their GPUs, did it render their proprietary chip irrelevant, and now they're using a software solution just like AMD? I'd think them adding this support is basically conceding their attempt to create a hardware monopoly via Gsync didn't work out so well (similar to hardware accelerated PhysX). As far as I read there may still be some advantages to their Gsync hardware implementation compared to even the best Freesync implementations available today, but to the average consumer the large price increase it added to the monitors seems unlikely to be worth it (I'm uncertain if the prices ever became reasonable). And the cost is probably only ""justified"" on Nvidia's part, because there is no competition that produces similar hardware that would cause the price to go down significantly. That said, it seems the majority of people are happy to pay less and go with a software based solution, unless I'm wrong about that?""

\---

**3. Them:** ""Technically both are hardware solutions. AMD is essentially improving upon and rebranding variable refresh rate mode that is standard in the newer DisplayPort signal standards. It is an optional hardware feature.

GSync is also a hardware feature, but essentially lets the GPU directly drive the display much like VR headsets use a special direct drive mode. This allows them to refresh the display at will (up or down to the physical limits anyway) whenever a new frame of video is ready to display. The GPU also gets feedback to know how long until the next frame can be displayed, allowing the GPU to intelligently throttle if going too fast (say, a 2080 Ti in CS:GO). This means that frames are always perfectly timed and frame pacing is as good as it gets. The FreeSync solution tries to replicate portions but cannot replicate all features. Namely, the frame pacing is horrible due specifically to the lack of direct GPU control of the display. If a set of frames render 50-52 FPS, the monitor might be told to run at 50 Hz. Then a few frames later the game speeds up and hits 105-110 FPS... but the display hasn't been told to refresh faster yet. You get a few frames that need to either be dropped or combed together, which eliminates tearing but still leaves a very percieved lag or jump in the framerate. On a consistent game this isn't much of an issue, but when pushing a GPU and having the framerate bounce around constantly, the game feels choppy.

It is indeed improved over normal displays, but as mentioned there is a hidden cost to FreeSync the consumer doesn't see. If you are paying for a feature, some people prefer to pay more for a better implementation of that feature. GSync adds about $250 to any SDR monitor and $300-350 to an HDR monitor (if a large format it can cost more). FreeSync default will require better strobing and a better scalar card that gas VRR enabled. FreeSync Premium requires a better scalar card that can hit lower minimal FPS and support compensation for when below that limit. Premium Plus uses a non-standard implementation and AFAIK AMD is the only company manufacturing the scalar cards for it, even if the design is open source. The feature isn't free as the name implies, bit closer to $75-150 extra cost over a fixed refresh rate display. 

Both are hardware solutions, and like with anything in the PC realm users can opt to pay more for better results, yet some users will see no need or even no difference. I say that if you notice stuttering and odd pacing and have the extra cash, go NVidia and GSync. If not, sure FreeSync could work... but NVidia also supports generic variable refresh rate now and labels it FreeSync support (but only standard and Premium support, as those are the ones that use the VRR DisplayPort standard). Considering that since VRR and FreeSync are effectively interchangeable terms and the latter can be used as a selling point via AMD's marketing, all displays that support VRR are labeled as FreeSync monitors. Essentially NVidia supports VRR because of DisplayPort, not competition... but it lets them dissolve the threat of FreeSync all the same so they use that name instead.

It's interesting, really. The whole AMD being the open source good guys is usually not really the case, and more often than not is to make NVidia look greedy or to stop a new feature from being popular. AMD killed GameWorks this way for example, even though the cloth simulation, fur and long hair rendering, and particle physics were all drastically better than CPU counterparts due to fundamental architecture differences. Ditto PhysX, which AMD actually could have implemented for free but chose not to do just to stem NVidia's growth. Granted, NVidia is out to make money--but they realize that horsepower increases will one day be harder to obtain (seeing that now, in fact) and that actual new features and techniques will be needed to make games better--and thus their market richer with opportunity. AMD is ironically stifling growth by claiming NVidia is harming industry growth via proprietary features. Hell, they even tried to claim NVidia faked raytracing until NVidia admitted the raw render output was cleaned up by neural networks, and that was the whole point of the turing neural chiplet on RTX. And now that raytracing hasn't died, AMD is cashing in on new raytracing console hardware sales this holiday season. New features push boundaries when given a chance to grow beyond a gimmick.""",4,1583445337,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fe2vdc/regarding_freesync_i_had_a_short_conversation/,Amd,1

fe1tyd,2much4me2day,New pc build crashing and freezing,"**Issues**

I recently finished my first ever PC build about a month ago. All was going well but I found that I was freezing in all of the games I would play. It usually happened about an hour into playing and then would get more frequent from then on. I'm a bit of a noob when trying to sort things out but I checked my CPU and GPU temps after a crash and both capped at a max of 80 degrees C.

I have a feeling it may be the Radeon overlay but I'm not sure. All of my driver's are up to date including my MOBO and GPU

**What things have I done?**

I ran furmark and cinebench to try and force my PC into a freeze but it never crashed under the benchmarking stress. I have also tried to swap my RAM around in various slots but nothing has helped.
I ran memtest for 4 hours with no errors

It mostly happens in Witcher 2 and in CSGO causing me to end task just to start the game up again. 

I'm a bit lost as to what to do now as i'm afraid if i leave it its just going to burn my PC out.

I'm looking to upgrade my old 1600 for something that doesn't bottleneck my 5700XT and I'm deciding between the Ryzen 7 3700x and the 3800x. In most benchmarks the 3800x has maybe a 3% better fps but it costs nearly 15% more in my country.

But I would like to know how much better the 3800x will be for emulators over the 3700x? Like RPCS3 or the Yuzu Switch emulator where single-core performance is absolutely everything. I would like to play games like The Last of Us, Breath of the Wild, Uncharted or RDR1 at the highest possible fps when these emulators improve in a couple months.

In some games it's barely noticable (CS:GO) but in other games it's borderline frustrating (GTA V and Batman Arkham Knight). In GTA V I've tried everything, running FXAA and MSAA both at once, turning one of them off, overriding to 8x SSAO along with morphological AA in Radeon settings and the solution that works best (I think, honestly I don't even know anymore) is 8x MSAA in-game and not overriding but enhancing game's settings in Radeon overlay, but the jaggies are still really visible. Batman only has an On/Off switch which supposedly turns on SSAA and I must admit it helps with the jaggies but they're still visible especially on the Batman's suit and the Batmobile. Could this be a fault with my hardware or me playing on 1080p.

I could get video output from my motherboard, and the pc could detect the gpu. 

I shutdown the computer, flicked the switch on the side of the gpu and booted the pc back up again. This gave me video output.

First I would like to say I just recently built a computer from the ground up and went with Ryzen so I am happy to say I am now an AMD user! It is amazing! I am playing Age Of Empires 2: Definitive Edition and I am wanting to stream using Twitch. I cannot seem to dial in my sound quality and balance of the game and my microphone within the Radeon Software. I would really like to use the Radeon software to stream instead of others because the video quality is A+. Can some one please point me in the right direction for dialing in the best sound quality when using a headset microphone? I am using a turtle beach headset with a mic/earphone splitter cable to my PC. When I stream there is either an echo or its choppy or there is  a lot of feedback but at the same time the game and my voice is crisp. How do I get rid of all of the roughness outside of my voice and the game? Is this windows settings? Are there settings in Adrenaline? Mic boost is at +20DB, maybe I should turn that down? What I am really looking for is a good walk through video on all sound settings for windows and adrenaline and how they work together, and at the same time explain what each setting does.

Basically you can replicate a system crash by enabling ReLive on a Radeon VII and start a run of the Superposition Benchmark. I too can confirm this and since I tried not running ReLive during my gameplay yesterday I did not have a single crash. Usually I would have one or two every evening sometimes more.

My question is: How can I keep clocks at 2000 mhz + at 99% load? What is recommended fan curve to keep temps for GPU under 80 degrees with OC?
Does MSI work well with the new drivers? Theyve had issues earlier. In regards to monitoring and overclock.

I didn't have any issues with GTX 1070 when using same monitors. This black screen usually happens if I start playing a game or quit playing. Today I got black screen while dragging Chrome tab to the second monitor. 

Also Watch Dogs 2 is still pretty much unplayable! I get annoying stuttering and FPS drops all the time and this issue started right after I upgraded from GTX 1070. Both CPU usage and GPU usage drop during stuttering and there isn't any problems with other games. I tried all the settings in game but non of them fixed it.

fdrfj4,kefuzz,"If you have high idle temps, try Ryzen Master Eco-Mode","I recently upgraded to a 3900X and noticed my idle temps were around 50-60C which caused my fans to spin up to 75% which is noticeably noisy.

After looking around online for other people's experiences I noticed alot of people with 3900X and other 3---X CPUs tended to have high idle temps as well, this is likely due to the stock clock setting of these CPUs being quite high so high idle temps were normal.

I didn't want to change my BIOS fan settings to a higher temperature so I tried using Ryzen Master and set it to Eco Mode and it made a significant difference in idle temps. Now my idle temps are 40-50C (my room is quite warm as I live in a tropical area) which is almost a 10C decrease. I was worried about performance drops but I've been getting the same FPS in games like Sekiro, Monster Hunter World and Witcher 3. Have yet to test how performance is when running 3D rendering softwares but I expect those to take a slight hit in performance as those can utilize the full 24 threads.

Anyways, if your goal is to slightly lower the idle temps so your fans don't keep spinning up maybe try Eco Mode before you change BIOS fan settings!",29,1583391193,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fdrfj4/if_you_have_high_idle_temps_try_ryzen_master/,Amd,1

Ryzen 7 2700X | Stock Cooler

Corsair 16GB | DDR4-3200MHz (CL16)

Currently: Aorus B450M

PowerColor Red Devil | RX 590 8GB

EVGA 500W | 80+

CoolerMaster Q300P Case


RAM is stable and working fine after finding a good kit, GPU and CPU tap out at 75° and 95° (tcl) respectively when both at max load (3DMark and CPUz Stress Test, closed chassis). Total peak power draw still under 400W. 

Cinebench scores are 1750 and 167 at most and the CPU tops at 80° by the end of the run and clock speed never goes over 3.9GHz.

So, I know this looks bad, but this power supply has been very good to me so far and I'm min-maxing the fan configuration in this chassis pretty hard. My question is: If shoddy case wasn't a problem, could I potentially get better stock (XFR, boost clock, etc.) performance by switching motherboards to the ASRock Pro 4 or am I limited by the stock cooler and high temps as a result either way?

P.S. - 2700x is idling at 50° btw with side panel off. I just want to get the most out of my 2700x mATX build, even if it means a different motherboard and cooler.

fdqzqx,kaitlin4599,why is my pc shutting down," 

ok a little back story a few weeks ago i upgraded my AM4 motherboard. and while taking the cooler off the cpu the cooler pulled the cpu out of the socket. upon inspection of the cpu i noticed a few bent pins, i gently bent those pins back and the cpu slid nice clean and easy into the socket on my new board altho i had some random boot issues that have since sorted themsleves out. cpu is a ryzen 7 2700. fast forward to a few days ago, i tried to overclock the cpu i followed a few guide but lets face it i have been overclocking cpu's since the old intel pentium 4 days so im not a noob. anyhow last night i ran the prime95 bland test went to bed and woke up to find that my system had shutdown for no reason average temp reported by ryzen master was around 73c on my 360mm aio. is it possible that the bent pins are the cause of my shutdowns? what other ways can i check to see if my system is stable at stock bios settings?

could the fact that the pins were bent even tho i bent them back be the cause of my issues? i should not that before the random shutdowns under stress testing i have other boot issues before they were sorted out

heres my system

asus CH7 X470 mobo

team group vulcan ddr4 16gb 2x8gb 3000 mhz ram

sapphire pulse rx 5700

seasonic focus gold 750 watt semi modular psu

512 adata ssd 5 4tb hdd seagate

wired internet

enthoo primo case

360mm cooler master aio

bios version: 2901

if it matters both the bios and hwinfo64 say my pump is operating at 4,500 rpm so i dont think my cpu is overheating nor do i think its a thermal throttle

i bought a cheap 1600AF cpu to test in my system to see if i still have the shutdown issue but it wont be here till next week?

just trying to figure out why my system isnt stable and why it shuts down when i stress test it if temps are fine",2,1583388623,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fdqzqx/why_is_my_pc_shutting_down/,Amd,1

I run temp checking software and stsrted game again and saw my cpu hitting 90c just after an hour. Is it normal? Is the system asking for better cooler? Why is the game so heavy on cpu?

I managed to bend some pins on my CPU while I twisted my cooler trying to place it more perfectly into the screwholes. After a full blown panic I managed to straighten most of the pins but the PC did not boot. So far I have checked my PSU (Corsair RM550X) and ramsticks (Vengeance RGB Pro) and deduced they are fine. Same about my old 560 GPU. But I can't test if my motherboard is dead or not. So my questions are:

• Will the CPU work if only some pins are slightly bent but fits into the socket perfectly? 

• Can bent pins short the motherboard somehow and damage it?  

• When I turn on the power, are case fans supposed to spin and RGB Ram spit out rainbows even if the CPU is dead and if they don't is it a sign of a dead motherboard? Because there is no sign of the motherboard working other than it's own RGB puke.",23,1583382532,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fdpuje/rip_3600tuf_x570bothunless/,Amd,1

Bought my First Alienware Computer

TL:DR; Thoughts on Ryzen 7 3700x and Radeon 5700 XT and Dell Shipping. 

Ladies and Gentlemen,
I’m pleased to share with you that I will be embarking on a grand endeavor... I’ve finally bought a Gaming PC.  In the past, I’ve had a MSi laptop with i7-7700HQ and GTX 1060 6GB that is a work computer. That was a fast laptop and I’ll still use it for work but I’ve decided to keep work and personal use separate and get a dedicated gaming rig with more power. So I decided on Alienware because of their sale going on. Even building it myself was more expensive same specs (pcpartpicker). I chose the Aurora Ryzen Edition because of it’s value/performance ratio.

Here’s my specs;
-Ryzen 7 3700x
-Radeon 5700 XT 8Gb GDDR6
-8GB Ram (Will buy 2 x 8Gb 3200mhz on Amazon)
-1TB HDD
-Liquid Cooled
-550W PS

Total price $1,152 with EXTRA17 17% off code. (Dell.com)

I wanted to get anyone’s thoughts who has the processor or Graphics card and share your experience, pros, cons, etc. Thanks. Also, is 32gb of ram worth it? 2 x 16gb or 4 x 8Gb better?

I only discovered this issue after changing to a 200hz monitor. So if you're using 120hz and above, your memory clocks does not go on idle which is for me, a BUG.  
[https://www.specterpro.com/products/30uw200](https://www.specterpro.com/products/30uw200)

There are numerous solution already like making a custom resolution and refresh rate with CRU but it's unstable and not noobsafe.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my solution.  
Create a batch file that changes refresh rate.   
You only need to run the batch file to switch from lower hz and higher hz vice versa whenever you your start gaming.

1. install free resolution changer a very small program called QRES.  
[https://winaero.com/download.php?view.2257](https://winaero.com/download.php?view.2257)
2. Run Batch file  


Create two text file and save it as .cmd (extension) and put this in your desktop.   
Run it whenever you want to use high or lower refresh rates.  


your batch file code will look like this. Right click and choose edit to modify the file.

for lower hz ""c:\\installation directory\\qres\\qres x=2560 y=1080 f=60""  
for gaming hz ""c:\\installation directory\\qres\\qres x=2560 y=1080 f=165""  


Here's my current batch file combined to my power plan. 

Note: I'm not using quotes because my directory does not have spaces.

&amp;#x200B;

where x and y is your current used resolution and f=supported hz ( not the custom created ones)  
For me, It's better than using CRU because you can easily botch the values.

fdl7cf,grappast,An ultimate guide into PBO adjusting.,"Hi.

**DISCLAIMER:**

*IMHO chasing highest clocks with PBO is like chasing ghost. Moreover - Ryzen by trying to get highest clocks actually performs worse. It boosts for very short period of time (HWInfo reports full second though). In consequence - by that short period of time - It heats up very fast and immediately drops performance radically. With all that said - highest boost != highest performance. If you are willing to sacrifice that placebo effect and get more performance - continue reading.*

**DISCLAIMER2:**

Not tl;dr will be marked with ***cursive bold.*** I'm not a native english speaker.

**Harder part - Vcore anchor.**

And It is also hard for me to discus, because there have been some opinions that by dropping Vcore you a) can't get more performance or you can even b) lose some. I disagree with a) and agree with b). Let me explain:

There are variables like: VCore, Temperature, Clock and Effective Clock that have to be taken into account. First three - there's nothing to explain. Fourth one is kinda tricky - because It is always different than Core clock. I'm not sure if It's about clock averaging or core clock (or average clock) minus error correction. If you are willing to shed some more light in that matter, please let me know in comments. The fact is - on stock voltage and maxed out PBO limits, clocks on high load are low, but Effective Clock is pretty close to Core Clock. Lower the VCore is - temps are lower, Core Clock is higher but that and Effective Clock are getting more distant (from now on Cdelta=\[Core Clock\] - \[Effective Clock\]) to the point where we are actually lose performance.

https://preview.redd.it/dl5zrliqgqk41.png?width=212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4887bc48e941aed145f90c6c1141bea11f9f3eaf

With that said:

***You can use voltage offset or static voltage. I prefer offset - It fluctuates better with PBO, but do as you wish. Start from 1.45V and max out PBO limits + PBO Scalar 10x in your BIOS. LLC where you can make steeper Voltage to Temp curve (MSI Mode 8 FTW) can also help. You can keep higher voltage on very low loads, that will ensure higher boost in this scenario. By lowering VSOC you can also keep temperatures low but make sure if It's stable.***

***Algorithm:***

1. ***Decrease VCore.***
2. ***Reboot to Windows.***
3. ***Launch HWInfo and CB20.***
4. ***Start benching in CB20.***
5. ***Observe Core Clock and Effective Clock.***
6. ***Calculate Cdelta=\[Core Clock\] - \[Effective Clock\]***
7. ***Repeat all algorithm until unstable and/or you exceed Cdelta&gt;=25MHz***

When you done you can go to:

**Easy part - PBO anchor.**

&gt;***PBO is kinda dumb.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Buildzoid

Thanks to Buildzoid's insight we know today that something weird has happened through AGESA updates - maxing out PBO limits hurts performance. We need to find a sweet spot. More explanation in his video: [https://youtu.be/ismHAZAHAUs](https://youtu.be/ismHAZAHAUs)

How to find it easy way:

***We need HWInfo, Ryzen Master and prime 95. Set PBO scalar to 10x in your BIOS (or you can adjust it, test all scalar settings if you want, maybe you find one that works better on your chip). PPT limit doesn't affect PBO other than hard limit so set it to 300 in BIOS and leave it. Launch HWInfo, Ryzen Master and prime95. Set prime95 burn like this:***

2. ***In HWInfo observe TDC Limit and EDC Limit. If any hit 100%, increase limit and recheck. Keep limit close to 95-100% but do not exceed 100%.***
3. ***In HWInfo observe CPU PPT. Note it.***
4. ***You want highest CPU PPT possible. Repeat above sections if needed.***

***When you are done set PBO limits in BIOS or just leave it applied in Ryzen Master.***

fdkrvu,cptcanuckistani,Upgraded from 6700k to 3600x due to the hype,"I ran a 4.7ghz delidded 6700k at 1.4v. I switched to a 3600x with a b450 gaming pro carbon ac board. I went with a 3600x because it was 25 dollars more than the 3600, and had the promise of 200 extra mhz worth of boost.

I run the 3600x with 3800mhz CL16 1:1:1, and pretty quick subtimings.

Overall my singlecore and gaming performance actually went down slightly, while my multicore performance almost doubled.

Problem is I primarily game, so the multicore performance makes it feel snappier when I alt-tab out of game, but besides that, it's not much use.

My core boost hovers around 4300mhz during game-play with PBO 300/230/230 2x scalar and 200 mhz auto-oc, and my temps are about the same as my 6700k.

AMD shouldn't be advertising these 4400mhz boosts, if the majority of samples aren't able to hit it. I can only imagine the storm that would be generated if Intel advertised my 6700k as having a turbo boost of 4.2ghz, and was unable to hit that.

For the price, these chips aren't bad, at least the 3600's, but I wouldn't buy anything above them. Hopefully AMD fixes their frequency issues and stops advertising speeds that can't be achieved.",76,1583359912,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fdkrvu/upgraded_from_6700k_to_3600x_due_to_the_hype/,Amd,1

Dx11 hard crashes and forces a restart, sometimes it gives me a bsod error on The Division 2 whereas Dx12 crashes to Desktop. The crashes are random and sometimes lets you play for an hour or just 10 minutes. This also happens in Fornite.

The 3900x I could never get to boot reliably, worse warm than cold, @3733 at any timings.  Given my experience in that board with the 2700x i never tried running up the SoC voltage since my copy was best at 1.03vSoC and I stupidly just assumed since same GloFo node for the i/o die and the 2700x, a similar pattern of behavior of less is more would be the way it worked.  

So the 3900x just validated @ 3733/1866 16-16-16-16-32-48 trfc 289 in HCI 2000% all instances and has already passed Aida64 48 hour.

My question is if anyone has any input regarding the potential danger to my SoC.  I have read the r/overclocking FAQ and done some light searching but can't help but feel maybe I am pushing the voltage too far into the potential hazard zone for hubris.  I'd hate to scrap a chip for basically very little.  I am not concerned with the potential of killing the chip beyond that.

I recently read reviews stating that this particular MSI board I purchased overheats the VRMs quite badly.

Should I return this motherboard and pick up another one? If Yes, which motherboard would you recommend instead around the same price point (ATX and ITX)? Or should i just keep using my Strix X470-F and return the MSI board?

fdf5r1,dschanoeh,Zen+/Zen2 setup for a low-power headless server,"Hi,

I'm thinking about upgrading my headless home server with a newer Ryzen setup. I’m currently running an i3 4170 and the whole system draws around 35-40W at idle including 3 HDDs and an SSD.

Initially I just wanted to upgrade RAM but feels like a waste to buy DDR3 at this point.

My goals are:

* Same or better power consumption
* Low price
* More cores and maybe slightly better single core performance
* ECC RAM

I’m currently looking at buying:

* Ryzen 5 1600 AF
* AsRock B450M Pro4
* A single (for lower power usage and upgradeability) module of 16GB ECC RAM 

I might also get a Ryzen 5 3600 for my desktop that could “trickle-down” to my server in a few years.

Does that seem like a reasonable setup for my goals and are there better alternatives that I’m missing? Or do you think the upgrade isn’t worth it and I should wait for Zen2 price drops?

I just built a secondary build for myself.

I found a good deal for a Corsair H80i V2 Pro so I purchased it.

fde0l9,juanmamedina,Last AMD Survey for new features | There is nothing needed there,"Dear AMD Radeon Team,

Today i completed my survey from the drivers app and realized that the only thing that i could found useful in all those options was the improved fan control. I really found the rest of the features nice to have **but not needed at all.**

The only thing that im asking AMD to have within the drivers control panel, since i bought my first R9 280X 6 years ago, is **an improved VSYNC control.** Enable Vsync driver option doesn't work at all and force triple buffering only works for OpenGL apps (an option that i would like to use in Devil May Cry 5 for example, since the in-game vsync uses double buffers and causes me framerate drops).

After having an RX580, an RX Vega 64 and now porting a flaming Radeon VII, i still doesn't have a proper driver vsync options. I used to install radeonpro.exe, a perfect app that allowed AMD users to have the same tweaking capabilities than the Nvidia users, radeonpro.exe stopped the support and is not working anymore with lastest drivers.

So, which options are actually needed? Here is my list of features that i really miss:

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Force VSYNC.** (for DX9-12 and Vulkan games).

**2. Force Triple Buffering.** (for DX9-12 and Vulkan games).

**3. Half-Refresh Rate VSYNC.** (Its anoyinng to setup my screen to 30hz inside windows options everytime i open and close a game that i want to play at 4KUltra30fps on my HDR TV with my gamepad).

**4. Adaptive-Sync and Half-Refresh Rate Adaptive-Sync.** (Enhanced Sync is completely useless, under 60fps is vsync off, perfect, but over 60fps is an stuttering mess, so i have to enable enhanced sync and cap fps using RTSS to achieve something similar to adaptive sync, but its still an stuttering mess, RTSS cap helps but doesn't fix the stuttering at all.)

**5. A proper fps cap.** Something that can maintain the frametimes and the framerates stable when the gpu reaches the frame cap.

**6. Bring VRS to Vega10, Vega20 and Navi10.** Please, don't make this feature exclusive for RDNA 2.0. We all know that this doesn't need exclusive hardware capabilities, just like raytracing does.

**7. The improved GPU fan control** is really needed for some users (not my case).

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, there was an option in the survey for improved radeon boost support, people didnt vote it, why? simple, **Radeon Boost is totally senseless**. We don't need games to lower the render resolution when we move the mouse, **we need games to lower the render resolution when the fps are under an fps target.** That is Adaptive Resolution with an fps target, and you know it perfectly, since it's use is really extended in the current AMD consoles. Thats how Radeon Boost should work, and what PC gamers need.

Finally, not everything is bad. I have to congratulate AMD for showing to all PC gamers that DLSS is actually an stupid feature thnx to **Radeon Image Sharpening**, a feature that works with every single game and doesn't need developers to program and train a complex and advanced IA with exclusive hardware (tensor cores) to achieve WORST results than a nice adaptive sharpening filter like AMD RIS. Thanks for that, i think that we all really apreciate it, but please, take a look to VSYNC options.

I'm a programmer by day, gamer by night and I'm looking for the very best settings to balance single and multi core workload performance on my 3950x. Curious what ya'll are getting, your setups, and what settings work best for you. Here's my best so far.

Shout out to core 0 for being the real MVP &lt;3

**Setup:** 

* CPU: AMD 3950x, top bin from  [siliconlottery.com](https://siliconlottery.com/)
* RAM: DDR4 3600 G.Skill Neo CL16
* Board: ROG Crosshair VIII Hero
* Cooler: EK custom loop, 360mm rad (basically this:  [https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-kit-p360](https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-kit-p360) ) 
* OCCT running in the background over several hours of gaming/working or just surfing the reddits. 

**Current BIOS settings all default except:** 

* PBO scalar: 3x
* \- 0.05 core voltage offset
* LLC level 1

**Up next:** 

* New water block from  [https://optimuspc.com/](https://optimuspc.com/) on its way (should net -5c) 
* Going to try the EDC 0 trick posted here. 

**A Few Things I've tried:** 

* PBO 300/230/230, 2x scalar (various voltage offsets) - ran super hot for me (75c-80c) and netted +200 in CB r20.  Clock boosts topped at 4.65ghz on core 0. 
* PBO 130/85/110, 10x scalar. Saw core boosts over 4.7ghz on core 0 and 1, CB r20 multi-core tanked to -500 off my best

fda9h7,arkl2020,Umm wow - 2700x - not all cores are working,"**Crazy long story, but I am shocked and super excited right now, if you wanna answer my question: it is at the bottom in bold.**

I am honestly kind of at shock. A while back I made a post because one morning I woke up and my newly built computer (at this time maybe 3 months old) just turned off and every time I tried to turn it back on it would get to the Windows boot logo and basically ""go dead"" (I made a post about it eventually in PCmasterrace but got nothing useful out of it, it was more of a hail mary anyway). I ended up running MemTest86 and kept getting errors on Test 6 Moving 64 byte blocks so I thought the issue was with my RAM but I have had enough experience with building computers that it just did not feel right to me, something was telling me not to send in the memory to be RMA'd just yet. So, for over a month now I have been using my laptop, which kicks ass for being a cheap laptop (Acer Aspire 5) but I could only use it for multi-media purposes and some web browsing.

&amp;#x200B;

I was about to start the RMA process for the memory but could not get it out of my head that something else was causing the problem, so I removed all the components and decided I would completely rebuild everything. It isn't even inside the case as I type it, just a motherboard sitting on top of its' own box with the bare essentials. I decided to run Memtest 1 more final time but with a lot of tweaks done in bios from ""Auto"" to all manual set settings. When I ran memtest, I got the same exact errors but this time I noticed something that I didn't originally:  it had the CPU set to round robin mode and the errors were happening on processor ""12"" and ""13"" respectively (it never tested any of the others since these caused so many errors it would just shut the test down). I have no clue why, but that gut feeling came over me again.... what if I just test 1 single processor/core? No errors...... test passed.

&amp;#x200B;

So, excited and kind of angry (my PC has been sitting on the floor for 45 days or so, untouched due to this) I went into the BIOS and manually set it to boot up only uses the first 4 processors. Booted just fine, no problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't believe it, my PC is running just fine (well, not really since not all cores are working...) at 4 cores and 8 threads. I am about to restart and get back into BIOS to see if I can run it with 6 cores and just avoid using cores 7 and 8 for now.

&amp;#x200B;

How did it this happen? I haven't OCed this chip since I haven't had a need to yet. I have left everything ""as-is"" after throwing it into this setup (I did originally have a different board but had to RMA it and while waiting for the replacement to arrive I switched; from the MSI Tomahawk Max to the ASUS B450-F) so the last thing I was ever expecting was a CPU problem. Even crazier is that when I just re-built it 30 or so minutes ago I accidentally pulled the CPU out of it's socket with the heatsink! I couldn't believe when I looked at it and saw no bent or missing pins but thought to myself ""they must be bent so slightly I just can't see it with my eyes"" but nope no pin problem! I stupidly did not think to turn on the PC first since it wasn't in a good state and didn't think about the fact the thermal paste had been sitting there cold for over a month now, and I have no clue what I was thinking on my last build as I had thrown WAAAAY too much thermal paste on it. Like literally at least twice as much, it was hard to clean as it was going over the edge and touching my fingers when holding the CPU by it's sides. I almost got thermal paste all over the pins! I basically soaked the CPU in some 99.9% alcohol, wiped it well, and let it dry off. Don't know where I was going with all this, just overfilled with emotions right now and had to tell someone lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**The question behind this long ass story:**

I still don''t understand what caused this, as for the first 3 months or so everything worked completely fine, even after the motherboard switch. Do you guys just think I got a bad chip and should RMA it to AMD? I have never had a bad CPU in my life before and the first time I ever RMA'd something was actually my first motherboard from this build. It seems like my luck is horrible on this build, but no user error and I'm finding RMA'ing things is a lot easier than I expected, just sucks to have to be without the computer for a bit due to 1 part...

&amp;#x200B;

**Something I just randomly thought of:** what if it isn't a CPU problem but actually something with the motherboard?! Is that possible? I should have my replacement board from MSI here pretty soon, maybe I should hold off till it arrives and test with that before RMA'ing the CPU... If this doesn't make sense and the motherboard can't be the cause of the problem, please let me know.

I’m almost ready to order the 2019 Mac Pro that’s fully loaded; however, I’ll purchase my RAM from 3rd party.

I’m a software engineer who specializes in cross-platform applications. Having many Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows Server, various Linux OS’s VM’s and MacOS available to me on premise is a requirement.

That said. Already having a 2015 15” MacBook Pro (fully loaded) along with a 2016 5k iMac fully loaded, I could get by building a hackintosh. 

I’d love to get the AMD 64 Core Threadripper and use that has the Hackontosh; although; my one requirement would be that the motherboard would need to support Thunderbolt 3 at full 40GB/s 

I read that the latest AMD Ryzen 3950x has native Thunderbolt 3 support with the high-end ASRock motherboards. I didn’t see support for the AMD Threadripper 3990x.

Can anyone kick some knowledge my way on Thunderbolt 3 support for the latest Threadripper’s and how hackontosh would support this latest Threadripper?

I’ll also hate not being able to use the Hackontosh with the new Apple 6k XDR monitor, but hopefully we will see support for it in the future.",8,1583304405,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fd94ro/amd_threadripper_3990x_w_thunderbolt_3_support/,Amd,1

I dont know if that is the real temperature of a offset or something because amd said on other ryzens that its 20c hotter because of a more even fan performance or whatever. I read something around those lines.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll will be doing some personally comparisons to performance compared to my old 1060 3GB at 1080p.

Games like Battlefield or Star Wars Battlefront this card destroys in, absolutely love it; however, this card disappoints in more than a handful of games compared to my old 1060. These games include: Minecraft, CSGO, Escape from Tarkov, Halo games(reach and CE), Just Cause 3, GTAV, Squad, Far Cry New Dawn and Star wars Jedi: Fallen Order. My performance in these games were either worse than my 1060 or about the same, which is quite annoying after paying $400. 


I originally thought it was because my clocks on the card were between 800-1800Mhz,but after the last driver update(An amazing update by AMD, fixed a lot of my problems) I was able to get my clocks up to and over 2Ghz, but still the performance was the same.

I've tried most if not all fixes that I've seen on reddit, from disabling ULPS to getting two cables for PCI connection instead of daisy chain.

fd4fee,theantipop,Upgraded from GTX 1080 to RX 5700 XT - Loving it!,"Hey all,

Recently just upgraded my AIO water cooled GTX 1080 to a reference RX 5700 XT. I have placed my AIO cooler on the 5700 XT, which went off without a hitch, and has been performing amazingly well.

The latest drivers (which I've read includes a multitude of fixes) are working flawlessly, and coming from Nvidia, I'm particularly impressed by the one click 'GPU Overclock' or 'Undervolt', as well as the Ctrl-Shift-O overlay that displays all the necessary information without being intrusive, and can easily be taken off. Very handy.

Overall, after coming from Nvidia (GTX980Ti then GTX 1080), I am really enjoying being back on Radeon (after my old R9 290), and have been pleasantly delighted by the performance of the hardware and the user friendliness of the software.

I've recorded a solid 20-25fps frame bump in Modern Warfare, where my card boosted to 2075mhz, whilst drawing only 165w of power, and staying around the 70-75c mark. Very satisfied with that!   
(I tried 2.1ghz, but ended up drawing nearly 200w of power, and junction temp rose to 95c)",58,1583281477,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fd4fee/upgraded_from_gtx_1080_to_rx_5700_xt_loving_it/,Amd,1

fd4994,Dminus313,"Upgrade from RX 560 to RX 580, or wait?","I've been out of the loop on hardware for the past 5+ years, but I'm finally upgrading my PC this week.  I'm on a fairly limited budget, but I'll be going from an i7 3700k and 8GB RAM to a Ryzen 7 2700x and 32GB RAM, so it's going to be quite a jump in overall performance.  I'm struggling with what to do about my video card, though.  For some context, I spend the vast majority of my gaming time on Classic WoW, which is definitely NOT graphic-intensive.  However, my brother recently gifted me Modern Warfare (which was the inciting incident for this upgrade) and I'd like to be able to play it with him.  I'm also looking forward to some upcoming MMORPGs like Crowfall and Ashes of Creation that will definitely benefit from more under the hood.

I know the RX 580 is a significant upgrade performance-wise from the 560, but I feel weird about replacing a card from 2017 with another card from 2017.  Is there something new coming soon that I should wait on that might bring newer cards like the Vega or RX 5x00 series down into the sub-$200 range?

fd4312,MakroCA,The recent leaks regarding the upcoming AMD cards are fake. Here's proof:,"So many of you have probably seen the leaks. I've attached the original image to the post. Now, as a Korean, I can confirm that the meaning of the text on leak is completely irrelevant to a GPU. Of course, this isn't enough. This is Reddit, and through all the big corporation paranoia going on these days, some might say that I was sent by SK. Now, I've done some digging and I've found the article on SK in which some of the text was ripped. 

[This](https://news.skhynix.co.kr/2136) is the link. Comparing the title of the article to the leak, as well as the leak subtitle, you can clearly see that it's just been slightly modified. Based on the other parts of the article, it looks like they were also taken from other posts. The parts regarding the 5950XT and the PCB are just put in to sell the effect. 

There isn't much of a reason for people to be siding with a random Twitter user without any credibility over the company itself without concrete evidence. I won't lie, SK took some pretty harsh steps, but not being in their position, I don't know their thought process, but looking at the evidence at hand, it's pretty clear that the leak is faked.

For reference, I have a reference Vega 64 under water, stock bios (I had issues with the LC bios, maybe a bad flash I'm not sure). PPT mod for 150% power limit, runs about 1700MHz at 1.2v and HBM2 at 1080-1100 timing level 2. Bench max of like 1780MHz and 1180 but super unstable there. I want to know what kind of performance gains I could get by going with a similar set up, probably a Powercolor Liquid Devil 5700XT, no power limit, max overclock. CPU is a 3900x, ram is 3733CL14-15-12-14-30, matching IF clock obviously. 1080p 240hz for most games, 1440p 144hz for some. I'm looking into VR as well, that will be coming soon. I would also consider a Radeon VII, or the rumored but supposedly not real Big Navi, but the Radeon VII performs worse than a 5700xt in gaming from what I understand, and big Navi might not even exist. Not looking to go to Nvidia, mostly because their cards are boring to overclock lol.

I'm planning to upgrade my dad's old PC for him which in the process means I'll be replacing every single device other than the HDD's and SSD, and moving CPU from intel to ryzen.

I’ve read lots of different advice from simply activating windows 10 and leaving drivers to doing a fresh install and completely uninstalling drivers, just confused what I should be doing. It would be great if anyone could offer some advice as I last did this 10 months ago with a completely fresh reinstall and wondered if I could get away without...

However the computer is laggy for 30 minutes or more, then it goes back to normal. The temperatures for both my GPU and CPU are around 100 F on idle, or 37 C, and the utilization is as expected for an idle machine. This lag happened both when I only had the SSD and after pluggin in my other HDDs, and it never happened in my old build, which means the new hardware is probably at fault.

fcyh7f,OldNeb,Quick Info on Latest Motherboard Tech?,"Hi, I haven't built a system since 2013 and I'm a little bit rusty on the state of motherboard technologies.  Sorry if this counts as tech support, I felt it was too generalized to go into that category.

I am looking at low-mid X570 boards.

I saw in one manual that once I go from 2 dimms of memory to 4, I will be limited in speed to sub 3200 RAM speed with **SPD**.  I had already read a bunch of articles about running memory with 2 dimms vs 4, and the question of ranks and there wasn't any mention of this, so:

**Q1)** Can I take it for granted that I will be able to run my ram at 3200 Mhz if I use **XMP**?

&amp;#x200B;

For PCI slots and NVM.  I plan to use PCI slots for my existing cards: 

1) wifi/BT card

2) graphics card

3) Wireless VR card

4) discrete sound card

For many of the boards I am looking at, like the ASRock Phantom Gaming 4, that fills all of my slots.  

Adding another slot seems to push my price range up $50 more.  In past systems I have usually ended up upgrading something, maybe USB5 gen 9 or maybe some advanced processing or capture card.  I know that most things can run off of the latest USB spec, BUT, for instance, there are no USB Wifi6/Bluetooth 5 adapters to be found.

I see boards that have ""M.2 socket (Key E) supports type 2230"" that can support a wireless module.  

**Q2)** are these slots generally expected to be forward compatible like with a PCIe card, or are they made to work with only the current gen module?

**Q3)** I thought I saw somewhere that using NVMe disks could disable one of my PCIe slots but I can't confirm this.  Does anyone have experience with this?

fcu6ir,drgn670,PSU and Power Draw of these parts,"Figured I'd also make a post here since it’s a full AMD build and I was just getting generic answers from somewhere else. Hopefully, I'd get a more definitive answer here plus I really would like to learn something new today ;)

Originally, I was planning to upgrade my RX580 to a 5600XT, but after calculating my savings plus the money I got from selling the RX580, turns out I can get a 5700 XT with it. But my problem right now is my PSU which is the Corsair CX550M. The recommended PSU is 600 watts on the AMD website, 50 watts more than what I have. Though after reading through some reviews, the power draw of the 5700xt seems to hover around 250-300 watts, though I'm not sure if that's correct, I just took the data from those reviews which said total power draw/consumption and I assumed that's what it was. As for my other power-hungry part, the Ryzen 7 3700x. Not OCed just PBO, though it doesn't do much since I'm living in a really hot area. Still, I'd assume it'd never go over 200 watts of power draw at full load cuz of 7nm and other power efficiency thingamabobs.

That puts me at around 450-500W and could be lower since I just assumed the 3700x draws in 200W (though please do tell me if I'm wrong about this) which is well within my 550-watt PSU. 

**So yea pretty much the question is, ""Am I really fine with my 550-watt PSU with a 3700X + 5700XT build? or should I just go with a 5600xt and cry in a corner?""**

Questions you guys might ask:

* ""Why not get a better PSU instead?""   
\-welp my budget turns out to be exact for a 5700xt. No extra money.
* ""But the best efficiency of the PSU is at 50% load""   
\-not worried at all about how much this would turn up on my electricity bill, I just hope my current PSU (no pun intended) is enough for this upgrade so I won't have to settle with a lower GPU and have extra money nowhere to spend.
* ""Then why not get a better PSU if you're not worried about your electricity bills?""   
\-budget for living expenses and budget for hobbies are two different things ;) Never mix those two up or you'd be dead ;)
* ""What's the full build?""

I'm using a Ryzen 5 3600 with the stock cooler (Wraith Stealth) and noticed  while I was playing Battlefield V, that the CPU temperature tend to run a bit high (70-80 degrees). Idle temperature is between 30-40 degrees, which seems fine. Running CineBench the CPU temperature hit 84 degrees.

I was wondering if it would make sense to replace the Wraith Stealth-cooler with the Wraith Prism (I can pick it up for 37$), or should I just invest in an aftermarket cooler instead?

fctgw6,Alex_Rose,Any predictions on the zen3? Worth the wait over 3950x at this point? Will it bring pricedrops to the 39xx series?,"I'm in the market for a new cpu having run an i5 2500k + 24gb ddr3@2133 for a decade. I'm still very content with my build and could get another 5 years comfortably, but I have spare cash in my company that's going to get corporation taxed if I don't spend it so I'm leaning towards grabbing 64GB ddr4@3200, 2+4TB m.2+ssd, a nice Ryzen and waiting for the next gen of raytracing gpus.

Given that I don't get taxed until December, do you think it's worth just holding on until July-October for zen3? I see murmurs that each clock might go up 200MHz and there'll be some nicer pcie 4.0 chipsets that are a bit more futureproof on potential future gpus.

Do you forsee a decent spec increase or price drop on the 39xx line expected to drop this summer? I'm largely looking to run another decade+ long build, which I find pretty easy in the modern age of super long console gens.

Obvs the benefit of buying *immediately* is my workflow gets marginally faster (mostly because of throwing away all my HDDs in favour of m.2/SSDs), but since I'm not getting taxed in the next 8 months, if there's expected to be a decent price drop on the 3950x or a decent spec up on zen3 before then I'll happily wait.",60,1583236340,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fctgw6/any_predictions_on_the_zen3_worth_the_wait_over/,Amd,1

MOBO will be good B450 (like MSI Tomahawk MAX) or some Entry-level X470/570 with the in-built wifi card.

I don't want to break the bank and just get the best bet for the buck since RAM is easily replaceable/upgradable anyway. My favorites at the moment are:

* G.Skill DDR4 DIMM 2x8GB 3600MHz CL16 (F4-3600C16D-16GVKC) ~$110
* Ballistix 16GB Kit DDR4 2x8GB 3600 CL16 DIMM (BL2K8G36C16U4B) ~$105 - can't find any reliable info or test though
* Patriot Viper, DDR4, 32 GB,3200MHz, CL16 (PV432G320C6K) ~$150 - a bit old and I'm not sure they work with Ryzen3 nicely
* G.Skill Ripjaws V DDR4 DIMM 2x16GB 3600MHz CL16 (F4-3600C16D-32GVKC) ~$210

The temps will then spike to high 60s while downloading and mid 70s while gaming, which is weird for me as my old CPU would sit comfortably at 60c full load and idling at low 30s.

The worst of all is that while downloading off Steam, the CPU will spike to high 60's for a second or two every couple seconds, only to come back down to low 50's. This makes the Wraith Prism fan ramp up and down over and over throughout the course of the download.

fcstvf,bulvinykas,"switched from a vega 64 to a 5700 xt - very, very pleasantly surprised","I had a vega 64 that was undervolted and overclocked to sane limits, and I thought that it was very close to a 5700 XT in performance

in absolute terms? it was, but the 5700 XT surprised me in a very unexpected manner - the framerate is a lot more consistent than with the vega 64

what I mean by that is when playing on 4k in certain situations my vega 64 would shit itself, there were far too many situations where the performance just dropped hard for whatever reason. with the 5700 XT that is no longer the case

so while ultimately the 5700 XT is just a tad faster than my vega 64 (10-15% on 4k), the framerate consistency is way, WAY better, and makes for much smoother gameplay.

I decided to get the 5700 XT as a stop-gap until the big(ger) navis get released at a rather opportune time - saw a good deal on the MSI Evoke model, and the 20.2.2 drivers dropped.

the thing undervolted easily to 1090mv, and the core is at \~2005mhz under load. memory overclock not so much, it's sitting at 910mhz, which is still better than nothing.

speaking of drivers, I have had **absolutely no issues whatsoever** so far. this is the one thing I was a bit uncertain about, a friend bought a 5700 XT as per my recommendation, and it was ridiculously troublesome on a 100% new OS installation. 

meanwhile the vega 64 was starting to piss me off with how shit the drivers were becoming as of late for it. this shows that vega cards are getting neglected in terms of drivers in favor of 5000 series. anecdote or not, I don't give a shit, but my vega is less stable on 20.2.2 than it is on 19.10.1. 

tl;dr despite the minor performance uplift over vega, the 5700 XT provides much more consistent framerates than the vega; also no driver issues!",96,1583232385,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fcstvf/switched_from_a_vega_64_to_a_5700_xt_very_very/,Amd,1

Just to be clear: I'm very happy with my 1950x, it overclocks to 3.975GHz on air, and I definitely NOT need an upgrade, but IF I would be able to sell mine around 400€, I guess it would be a nice upgrade for around 100€ - again, IF I can sell mine at that price...

fcrjcq,Medallish,Recently got an XFX 5700XT Thicc III my initial thoughts:,"Upgraded from a Fury X to 5700XT, I was going to hold out for big navi, but I had a little extra money for an upgrade, and was pretty annoyed with certain vulkan titles being unplayable for various reasons(Rage 2, ran fine, changed the settings, was impossible to get to run decent after that, The Surge 2, something similar happened) or the Vram holding me back.  


Performance &amp; Overall impressions:

Anyway on to the card. I hate the name, it's just dumb, but I went for the XFX one because it sounded like they listened to legit criticism, and went all out, attempting to make the best 5700XT, so far I'm impressed with the performance, it just chews through anything I throw at it, I need to do some more extended testing, but based on me eyeballing it during gaming sessions, my card regularly stays above 2GHz, highest I've seen it is 2035MHz, compared to a few benchmark videos I've seen on youtube it seems to be pretty decent for a 5700XT, without OC.  
Ofc. that comes at a cost, and with my settings that are +50% power limit and everything else at default, it gets pretty loud, doesn't bother me too much, but I can definitely see it annoying some, I suspect with some tweaking you can probably get it really quiet, while performing in line with your standard 5700XT, but for me, I just want all out performance for now. I should add I haven't seen the card get higher than 72 degrees.  
So far I've only run one Benchmark, namely 3Dmark Firestrike, and scored [23799](https://www.3dmark.com/fs/21957540)

I plan to run a few game benchmarks, but I want to dial it in a little with Firestrike first, I see I'm a few % behind stock 3700X' on X570 motherboards.  


I am a little unclear at what setting the bios switch is on by default, it is my understanding that it has two settings, a 180W and 230W mode, iirc, it's probably at the 230W with the clocks and power usage I'm seeing, but I wish XFX made it more clear.  


Drivers &amp; software.  
I've had AMD since 2008, switched from nVidia to AMD when the HD 4000 series launched, and never really saw any reason to go back, I don't doubt that there's been issues with the 5700XT, but I think the press has blown them a little out of proportion, I first installed it with the driver before the current one that supposedly fixes everything, I didn't have any issues with the previous, or the current one of course. it just works.  
I haven't really used the included software since the introduction of ReLive, so last night I had to make a clip for a friend, and was pretty blown away from the fact that I could edit the clip through the overlay, it's intuitive and works pretty damn well for what it is, completely free.  


I would definitely recommend this card, especially if you like tweaking around a little, I don't know if it has the potential of being the highest performing quiet card out there, the cooler certainly seems big enough, but as a 5700XT that effortlessly brings you really [close to a 2070 Super](https://www.3dmark.com/compare/fs/21691270/fs/21957540#), I think it's definitely among the better.  


Just felt like sharing my experience a bit, haven't tweaked &amp; tested things like this for a while due to being busier lately, let me know if there's something I should try with this card, or if you want a benchmark so we can compare results.

  
I started typing this yesterday before I had done any testing, and while I was on an 1800X, after researching a bit, I picked up a 3700X last night, and I'm quite glad I did, as you see it improved every aspect of the [benchmark](https://www.3dmark.com/compare/fs/21957540/fs/21957223), especially the combined test.",30,1583223253,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fcrjcq/recently_got_an_xfx_5700xt_thicc_iii_my_initial/,Amd,1

Some Throwaway account claims to have information on the Financial Day on March 5th.

Dont know if this is real, so take it with as many salt as you can get ;)

""They show off their raytracing solution, built together with AMD for native DXR hardware support. 30 to 50 % more efficient (depending on workload/use case) than RTX implementation of DXR. RDNA2 was created exclusively for Microsoft and high power Radeon GPUs, includes deep learning AI for upscaling, animation interpolation (adding 60 fps support to 30 fps games) and highly varied NPC intelligence. Turn 10 is the powerhouse for it, they've been working exclusively on this tech for one and a half years and are showing off an unnamed racing game in the rain. Raytraced reflections everywhere, using a combination of ray traced light probes in low frequency parts of the image for global illumination and actual raytracing close to the near view frustrum. SSR is used wherever possible, with rayracing adding on top of that to get rid of SSR artifacts (show example of a slow camera pan over the Nurburgring, the switch between SSR and DXR is not noticeable until they show multi-colored dev mode which part is rendering what and how).

Next up: VRS. Playground added it to Forza Horizon 4, first iteration when they received devkits in December already increased frame rate by 32 %, no optimizations, just using VRS in parts with motion blur. Talk about how until now motion blur was a post process effect, VRS changes the way they design games (VRS as motion blur replacement). Lead engineer says they can reach 4K/120 today on XSX thanks to RDNA2 architecture and the combined effort of AMD and Microsoft.

Lisa Su and Phil Spencer talk about what's next for the industry. Deep dive into xCloud, something about special cloud features built into XSX and supported by RDNA2 GPUs. Then Azure raytracing. Powered by RDNA2, able to run full scene raytracing on any device as long as it is online and connected to Azure. Playground again. ""This is what our second team has been working on over the past two years"". Live demonstration using realtime connection to Azure. It's a forest. It's the most mind blowingly realistic forest you have ever seen. Just a camera pan through it, switching between local raytracing and Azure raytracing. The difference is staggering. Different seasons. Snow is forming, the deep sun is shining through every single snowflake on screen, casting diffuse shadows. Snow melts, forming puddles and streams, all lighted with a precision that was impossible until now. Just a glimpse into the future, not actually planned for their next game, local raytracing only for now.

Those are the relevant parts of the event. Before and after is Lisa Su talking about the potential of RDNA2, three new RDNA2 GPUs, highest end is 18.x TF for $999. Talks about TSMC and how amazing the partnership has been, 7nm+ faster than ever and 5nm tracking even faster. Stresses the partnership with Microsoft and the importance of their cloud business for the future. Expects 40 % growth YOY just from cloud.

Today, I installed my replacement EVGA 2070 Super Black.

Right off the bat... a major problem that I didn't know was a problem before... it went away completely. I was getting a lot of stutter in various titles that I just chopped up to being issues with the games themselves. After all, frame rates were more than adequate for my gaming needs. After installing the 2070 Super, these issues went away COMPLETELY. I want to also add that I ran the 5700 off a fresh installation of Windows 10. I didn't bother with the 2070 Super (I did use DDU prior to installing it though).

Also, the Radeon software is horrible. I didn't realize how bad it was till I went back to nVidia. I'm sure that's a no brainer to everyone. My pocket book isn't too pleased with me though... nVidia still gouges with their prices.

fcmw6d,NotYourEverydayDonut,Advice straight from the horse's mouth (The Ryzen Rebuild?),"[Current specs](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/zjHGhg)

I've recently gotten interested in doing a themed build. At bare minimum I'd be replacing a motherboard b/c my current one is pretty basic is missing a few features I need to complete the theme. Also planning to swap cases as well, which is basically a full rebuild. With that comes a question: **should I take this chance to sidegrade to the 3600 from the 9600k?**

I've probably watched 30+ videos comparing the two and haven't seen anything negative towards Ryzen, Its praised for its raw value/performance per dollar. The general consensus is ""why pick the 9600k over the 3600?"" Sure the 9600k has ***SLIGHTLY*** better gaming performance in general, but the 3600 does **literately everything else faster/more efficiently**. For the OC enthusiasts prepared to say the 9600k can overclock better/more, I've never overclocked, and most likely never will, I wont be missing much from that department. With the 6c/12t of the 3600, I'm also betting it will age *much better* than the 9600k. On a random sidenote, 95% of the build guides over at /r/buildapcforme recommends Ryzen processors, so I'm over here thinking I did something wrong.

[My original plan was to just replace the motherboard and case, get some custom PSU cables+custom GPU backplate then call it done](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VBmHq3)

It feels **really stupid** to buy a $200 Z390 motherboard when I can drive to the Micro Center instead, grab a CPU/Motherboard bundle for $70 more and increase productivity performance across the board, while still keeping 90%+ of my current gaming performance. This board checks off so many things, Its mainly black/white, It has an ARGB header, its got WiFi for the random occasion when I need it, pre installed IO shield, and its Ryzen 3000 ready, so no hassle of getting an older Zen 2 chip, updating bios, etc.

[But then it hit me, The Ryzen Rebuild plan (?)](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HqsCZf)

The thing that scares me the most is the RAM compatibility with Ryzen. I've searched this sub a bit and see **all kinds of ram issues that I really don't want to experience**. I don't know a single thing about timings, XMP, custom timings, Bdie, CL15, CL16 whatever, I just want it ""to work"" like it does with Intel.

fcmu04,p-__-q,Any reason for me to buy the 3700x/3800x over the 3600x?,"I'm putting together a new build, and Micro Center has the following:  3800x at $300, 3700x at $270, 3600x at $170.

Currently using an i5-4670k.  Will be pairing new CPU with 1080ti and 1440p/165hz monitor.  It will be a gaming/YouTube/Netflix rig.

I'm considering the 3600x, but is there any truth to games running at 8 cores in the near future?  If so, would the 3800x be worth the extra $30 over the 3700x?

Also, any reason not to go for a reasonably priced x470 or B450 board instead of something else (regardless of CPU choice)?  I don't plan to upgrade again for the next 5+ years, unless I buy the 3600x and 8-core gaming becomes a thing -- at which point, I guess I'd upgrade to something on the same board.

fcml8s,gnx100,Upgrade from Ryzen 5 1600 to 2600 or 3600?,"Hey everyone!

I need some advice on which cpu I should upgrade to. I currently have a Ryzen 1600 with an Asrock Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming ITX and long story short I accidentally dropped my cpu which bent some pins that I have managed to straighten out but now only 1 of my ram slots work effectively leaving me with half RAM capacity (I have 2x 8gb RAM sticks).

For a while I've been eyeing the 2600 to replace my 1600 but hadn't bought it yet because it wasn't very urgent. However, given the current situation with the coronavirus and impending supply constraints I figured now's the best time to upgrade.

For some context I live in Japan and the price for the 2600 is around ￥15,000 ($140USD) and the price for the 3600 is ￥25,000($230USD) but if I were to import the 3600 from Amazon US the price works out to around $190USD. 

Which of these 2 CPUs should I upgrade to? I'm leaning towards buying the 2600 due to being able to receive it next day, save some money in the process, and also because I don't do a lot of heavy gaming (I have an RX 580 8gb). Would spending the extra money for the 3600 be worth it or should I go ahead with my original plan?

All help is appreciated!

fclx2f,Paulnerd,"MSI MEG Ace doesn't have ""disable option ROM"" feature?","\[Newbie here.  Original post got deleted by the 'bot.  Figure I would repost under ""discussion"" flare since this could be of interest to others.\]

I got a shiny new MS Meg Ace X570 and transplanted my 3950X over from the old Asus Prime X370 (a real trooper).  Everything seems fine and the infinity mirror lights are real pretty.  But a real annoyance is that there appears to be no feature to disable loading of the option ROM in the PCIe slots.  I'm familiar with Asus and Supermicro and they have an option to enable/disable the option ROM for each slot.  I don't see this in the BIOS (running the latest from last month) and have searched the manual.  There is an option to disable the option ROM for the onboard NIC.  My 10G network card's option ROM slows boot up by a few seconds and will get worse if I put in my PCIe SSD which has a RAID controller.

I hope I'm missing something.  I hate to return the board and lose my shiny LEDs.  Is this common in other brands?  There's very little discussion of the BIOS features in reviews so this caught me by surprise.

My network card also didn't function in slot 3 but did work in slot 5.  I haven't investigated yet but assume it's related to the speed or lane configuration in the BIOS for the slot.",3,1583194743,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fclx2f/msi_meg_ace_doesnt_have_disable_option_rom_feature/,Amd,1

fcldwz,3ggplanter,Ditching my 5700XT for 2070 Super and it feels so good,"I completed my first build in Nov 2019. It was a fun experience and a lot easier than I anticipated. I followed a build outline on YouTube and the cost was about $1200 total. It had been more than 10 years since I owned or played a game on a computer, and I was super excited to get back into it. 

Unfortunately I experienced nothing but troubles with system. Every game I tried to play would crash. Sometimes upon launching, sometimes after 10 minutes, sometimes I got an entire hour in. Lowering the video settings on the game settings seemed to help but I would still experience random crashing. 

I didn't immediately think it was a gpu issue. It was a brand new build by a newbie (me) and so I immediately started troubleshooting. I devoured the forums to rule out every possible piece of hardware. .

So for two months instead of enjoying my new computer, I was busy doing hours of research and troubleshooting every week. I quickly realized that there were driver issues with 5700XT, as many many other people on the forums were reporting. Eventually I narrowed it down to the 5700XT.

It's a shitty feeling spending so much money on a system and not able to fully enjoy it. It's like buying a fast sports car but not being allowed to go faster than 20mph. 

After 4 months and countless hours of troubleshooting and headache I finally caved in. I woke up on Saturday morning and said fuck it, I deserve to finally enjoy the toy I spent my hard earned money on. So I spent more of my hard earned money and bought a 2070 Super at Bestbuy. 

10 minutes after I get home I have her inside. 10 minutes. 5 more minutes for driver installation and we're off to the races. My go to game detects new gpu. It asks if it wants me to set settings on the game based on my hardware. Sure. Ultra everything. Nice, that's what I thought I spent $1200 to see. Launch game. I then experienced four straight glorious gaming hours on maximum settings, 144 fps, and 1440p resolution. It was everything I imagined it would be. GLORIOUS.

I know it's just a computer but the freeing feeling I experienced from swapping to the 2070 Super was incredible. I literally poured over 100 hours of troubleshooting after all said and done, 4 months of headache, 4 months of disappointment and borderline depression. 15 minutes after I return home with the 2070 Super and the pain is finally over. 

Nothing against AMD, I have the 3600x and it's wonderful. It's just the 5700XT did not work for me. For anyone curious, I was using the Sapphire Nitro Plus which I've been told is one of the better ones. 

I would have spent the extra $150 initially on the 2070 Super if I knew what I know now. 

tldr: Spent countless hours troubleshooting 5700xt crashing, 4 months later swapped for 2070 Super and my life is now complete.",18,1583192506,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fcldwz/ditching_my_5700xt_for_2070_super_and_it_feels_so/,Amd,1

So I'm making my first build hopefully in two weeks time, after almost a year and a half of saving and contemplating different parts.

I saw the 5700XT driver update which made me pretty excited. I was really concerned about the 5700XT not doing well after seeing so many driver crash posts, and people explaining their reasoning for switching to Nvidia.

I really don't want to spend hours troubleshooting etc, I was leaning towards 2070 super for stability, which sucks because the 5700XT has pretty much the same performance for £100 less (UK), and I really don't want to have to return anything either.

\- Ryzen 5 3600

\- XFX Ultra THICC III 5700XT

\- B450 TOMAHAWK MAX

\- Highest Mhz DDR4 2x8 ram I can find

fcjatn,-TheBakery-,Displaying Weird Colors Of Recordings,"Hey guys/ladies,

My buddy has been having an issue with recording game clips through AMD. The recordings look great and are smooth but for some reason the colors are all jacked up. He was recording a nice clip he hit in Quake: Champions and he showed it to me and it looked like it was all on a green scale. Every color in the recording has a green hue to it. 

I told him to switch to another game and try recording so we went into a fortnite creative session and same thing, but blue and purple. 

I really don’t know why it would be playing back with different color filters, but I wanted to make a quick post and see if anyone knew of a quick fix. He would like to use the prebuilt recording to make everything easier on managing clips, but if we can’t find a fix he’s going to look for a 3rd party software for it.

fcijqh,Fasibabbanzia,"I'm sorry guys, I'm about to let the Team down...","I truly apologize to you Team Red, because I'm about to do a terrible thing. I want to confess,  to let it all out, in the hope that some one stops me, before I commit  such an extreme act...  I'll tell you all the story from the beginning.  From where my dream started, to where they cushed....

  
To introduce me, I  would define my self as a long time PC enthusiast. Started gaming back  in 1993 with Star Wars: Rebel Assault. From there it was all an  escalation where I used many different PCs and builds untill I finally  decided to build my first system in 2010. Went for a mid range gaming pc  with the great ATI HD5770. Oh boy that card gave me so many joys! I was such a hardcore AMD fanboy back then. Year afetr year, I managed to upgrade every component one at a time, when I  had saved enough money...  
After the wonderfull experience with my HD5770 I  decided to buy a R9 270x in 2014. It was kinda meh, then just 2 years  later, when team green series 10 came out, I decidedit was time to switch side of the team...I have no excuses for that besides I'm italian, so you know, we pretty used to switching sides when the tide turns.... 

   
And now we get to present days. The 1060 still  doing pretty good but it's starting to show it's age in FHD @ 144hz (in some games). When Team red announced the RX5000 series I was pretty hiped. I said my time for redemption had come. Furthermore, I was  super happy because my experience with Ryzen CPUs was so positive, really. So much performance at an affordable price!  Finally some competition on the market after many years. I saw the  RX5000 launch back in summer wasn't perfect but you know, every launch  is a bit messy. Even team green sereies 20 was a mess at launch with  tons of cards sent into RMA. I red on forums and watched video about  different customs, temps, noises performance... I decide I wantet a Gigabyte  RX5700 in december. Kept track of prices and finally get a good  warehouse deals for that card a couple weeks ago. I WAS SO EXCITED! I really wanted to have a full Team Red build, really. I  knew that many users where experiencing driver issues but I said, F it  I'll give it a chance. The everage user maybe is a bit dumb and don't  even know how to properly install drivers soooo..... I't wont happent to  me. And believe me or not guys, it didn't happen!  


Got the card. Wiped old teem green drivers. Installed Adrenalin. Runned some benchmarks and.... BOOOM. Awesome performance. 230 fps in Kombustor Furmark and super stable in OCCT stress test. No crashes, no balck screeens. 30-40 fps in most games I tried (Apex legends, Sea of thieves, Deus EX). I said I was lucky. Got the big deal.... but then I played a game of League of Legends.... and that's where my all dreams crushed....

Another bit of context here. I play LoL since season one and in those 10 years I created so many connections with wonderfull people arownd Italy and EU. So many good friends, we see each other frequently and one was even my best man at my wedding. So LoL is still an important part of my life. And I will keep playing it even if I kinda hate it deep inside of me. 

Back to our story. LoL seemed to work fine but was experiencing weird frame drops and stutters. It is particularly bothering in a PVP based game where even the smallast mistake can ruin your next 30 min. Turns out it is a pretty common issues with RX5700 and RX5700XT. Tried every possible fix I found online. Wasted a lot of time and nothing worked. New adrenalin software seemed to have worsen the issue... (just on LoL). I was desperate. Then I decided to put my old card back in... Didn't felt so much of a downgrade in games. LoL was 144fps super stable. Apex 144 fps most of the time. Same for sea of Thieve. 

So, the disgracefull act I'm about to do, is returning the card.... Maybe I will get my money back and give it a shot in few months, probably finding it at an even lower price. Maybe I will go team green again... But why should I keep a card that is not crushing a 10y old game that would run super smooth on the integrated graphic of a 5y old laptop? Why should I spend so much time in looking for a fix? I have a full time job, a wife... my gaming time is so little I can't afford to spend an entire weekend formatting and installing stuff anymore... Guys at AMD I know they are doing hard work to fix those stuff but that's a gamble.... maybe the next drivers will fix it or maybe they will not.... So please, give me a valid reason not to return the card. I have still 2 weeks if some of you can convince me in trying one last time....

Thanks for reading through this pathetic wall of text. 

GO TEAM RED, forever

Fasibabbanzia

TL;DR: My RX5700 is crushing every benchmark but performs average in games and most importatnly it stutters and drops fps in a stupid 10y old game wich unfortunately is the game I play the most.

First: With recent drivers apparently fixing quite a few things, and the BIOS update for 5600xt out. If my target is 1080p gaming and I have a preference for a quiet system, which makes more sense:

1. A good 5600xt with the BIOS update. Seems like the [Gigabyte Gaming OC](https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Graphics-192-Bit-GV-R56XTGAMING-OC-6GD/dp/B083X25J8C) has good clocks with the update [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/etnr7c/radeon_rx_5600_xt_cards_clocks_overview/) and can be had for $300.  Triple fan cooler probably run pretty cool and quiet, some videos showed it performing favorably to the Sapphire Pulse.

2. Entry level 5700 AIB. Obviously has that extra 2GB of memory and the bandwidth advantage (not sure how relevant that is for 1080p) but at the low $300 price range may suffer from meh cooling. Good coolers for the 5700 seem to get close to $400.

Part 2: If the better option is the 5700, which of the following entry level AIB is the better buy (keeping it around low $300)

1. XFX DD Ultra [LINK](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/tt7p99/xfx-radeon-rx-5700-8-gb-dd-ultra-video-card-rx-57xl8lbd6)

Im not sure how this effects other Ryzen generations but I can tell you coming from a 6700k that it did not effect Intel nearly as much and im confused as of why. Basically ICue is making my cpu try to pull 3+ more volts more then normal at stock bringing my CPU temps from 38c to 45c at idle. It also would try to wake up idling cpus and make them use just a little bit of processing power when they were otherwise doing nothing.

If you plan on buying an expensive cpu such as a 3950x I would skip any corsair products unless you are comfortable with that increase in voltage and temps at idle.

I read many articles where it was indicated to change to BLAS library for boosting performance while using numpy operations. Is it straightforward for changing library MKL to BLAS. After changing from MKL to BLAS can we expect same performance as Intel 9900 KF

I am also wondering whether I should select 9900 KF  as most of time I would be working on python with data manipulation which use single core.

I am blown away with the complexity of this issue and most of the recommendations on similar threads are not straightforward

Are there any other considerations that I need to keep in mind while selecting between these two - particularly for ML/DL applications and gaming

I replaced my 1700 with 3600 last week and it's a definitive boost in gaming, but I like overclocking and benchmarking and have been trying to find and answer as to what is ACTUALLY the safe voltage range.

Currently I got my 3600 running 4Ghz all core with 1.264V, and using auto voltage to see what the ballpark voltage for 4.2Ghz is, seems to be 1.34V something.

Some people say that 1.325V is the maximum for all day OC, but then some have quoted AMD Robert saying that the safe range is all the way up to 1.5v.

I achieved 4.1Ghz with 1.3V but decided to go back to 4Ghz 1.264 because I couldn't find a reliable answer and don't wanna immediately degrade my new chip +  the extra 200Mhz probably does almost nothing for games.",58,1583163473,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fcdt4z/what_is_truly_the_safe_voltage_range_for_r5_3600/,Amd,1

Ive noticed my 3950x was running a bit hot at idle ""47-60c"", was stuck at 4.1-4.2ghz so says windows but its really around 3ghz to 1.5 per core, had a constant 1.4 core voltage, and was under performing in all applications. Resetting Bios and re installing windows did not fix this for me so I narrowed it down to the windows 10 power plan settings and found out some interesting things.

If I use any power setting other then ""Power Saver"" then my cpu will idle at those higher frequencies which is expected but basically they all do the exact same thing for some reason. It 48c-ish idle temp I think thats a bit high using those power options. 

The other issue I have is that if I use ""Power Saver"" is that it parks your cores and I personally dont like that BUT it does idle at around 38c which is fantastic AND my non parked cores clock down to 1.8 to 2ghz at idle which is what I want and sits at just below 1 core voltage.

So im trying to figure out how to create the perfect scenario for me, id like to clock my idle cores as low as possible without parking them and using the least amount of voltage as possible during idle. Is there a way to achieve this?

Funny thing is if I use power saver option I can squeeze an extra 100mhz while gaming totaling around 4.3ghz which I know is low because the CPU SHOULD boost to 4.7ghz but it just doesn't ever.",1,1583161364,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fcdal5/3950x_power_issues_with_windows_10/,Amd,1

fc9vzk,Dnkl_BottomsPH,Vega 64 Black Screens,"Greetings red team,

I bought this Asus Strix Vega 64 OC second-hand last August, 2019, for about 220 USD. Owner said that there were no issues with him (except for a physical scratch on the backplate). Originally bought October of 2018, he had it opened to replace the paste and the VRM pads. The GPU was run at an undervolt of 950mV iirc, since It was placed in the NZXT H200 (a very tight fit).

Now, I haven't tried his settings since I'm using MSI AE to undervolt, but I have two profiles set-up here for performance or cooler temps. Either way, I still get these prolonged black screens from time to time. It isn't often, hence why It took me months to ask about it, instead of just reading online (nothing worked yet). I haven't tried swapping my PSU (Seasonic M12II620 EVO), but I'm hoping that's the cause, because I've tried everything I saw online.

Temps are actually okay with my undervolt settings, and are especially good outside the case (NZXT H200 too).

All the previous cards I had never did this. (1070ti, 1070, and many different RX 580 and 480). Though, I've never tried testing this Vega 64 on another PC.

A somewhat consistent pattern I saw is that It goes away when I power drain the system (holding power button while system is unplugged) and that it sometimes shows up when the PC has been on for several hours.

Ryzen has caught my attention for some time. I can pick up a 2XXX r7 for around 100$ on ebay and ive thought about it, since playing division 2 and my CPU running at 100% at 1080p no matter what i do. not to mention i want to stream or record and cant even do either due to the cpu running so high.

Ive been editing alot for my youtube channel so i feel the extra cores will help with Filmora, streaming (can only stream at 720p or else cpu skyrockets to 50%), editing, as well as being able to put out higher resolutions, weather its streaming or gaming (have a 4k monitor now). I saw ALOT of posts say for gaming, its kinda a wash, but based off my other productivity, is it a worth wild upgrade?  
i currently am running 32 gb of 4x 8gb 2600mhz sticks, im sure i can oc them and plan to, to make up for the ram differences ive seen since ryzen came out (they love their higher clock speeds)

All in all, worth wild upgrade? will i be hurt more with the lower speed ram than i think? like major performance hit or minor? also im unsure of what mobos work with them anymore, intels 1151 stoped after kabby(required bios update...), coffee has its own and idk the 9XXX series. i think i saw all ryzen mobos work with any generation at this time?

fc3zmx,evolution2015,Does FreeSync work for non-exclusive full-screen apps under Windows?,"Both my monitor and my Radeon graphics card support FreeSync. The video player I use has options like v-sync and using ""exclusive mode"" when playing videos in full-screen. I guess the ""exclusive mode"" is occupying all the graphics card output like a full-screen 3D game.

Question 1: Does FreeSync even work on a desktop? I mean, if I play a video in a full window (but not full-screen) and the Windows Taskbar is showing, how can it work? The desktop refresh rate is set to 60Hz, and let's say that the video framerate is 29.5 or something, does FreeSync work for the video player?

Question 2: If I enable FreeSync, I see

* not full-screen (including a maximised window): no tearing
* full-screen but not exclusive mode: tearing
* full-screen, exclusive mode: no tearing

How can this be? Is a full-screen mode of a video player a special video mode? But to me, it seems that it is nothing more than a maximised window that covers the whole desktop. And the sizes of the video area of the maximised window and of the full-screen are not that different.  Why does FreeSync affect the full-screen mode (not exclusive)?

---

If FreeSync only works for exclusive full screen like game, then I guess it has no benefits for me.

fc3529,iwannabethisguy,"Beginner to undervolting, feedback on results welcomed (3700X).","I followed this guide to undervolt the 3700X I had and I'm looking on feedback if I did it properly or if there's something else that I need to do.

First off, I wanted to try undervolting because of the other posts in here that talked about improved thermals and acoustics from doing this. I'm using a Black Ridge V2 cooler in the K39.

Now, on to results.

I started off with adjusting the PPT. I found that reducing the PPT from 88W (auto/default) to 75W gave me the best tradeoff between MT performance (&lt;5% loss) and CPU temps (-5 C) after running Cinebench R20.

https://imgur.com/KdmixhJ

Then I tried adjusting the cTDP. I saw that the temperature was actually higher than default so I cut the benchmarking for this setting short.

https://imgur.com/vrSLkoZ

Next was VCORE offset. I had to spend some time looking on google for altering this setting on my BIOS (X570I AORUS), and then I went straight to benchmarking for -0.075V (no difference to default) and -0.100V (significant performance loss for both MT and ST).

https://imgur.com/GangiyK

I thought this was weird because I've heard so many good things by offsetting the VCORE alone, so I asked around if I actually did the offset properly. It seems like I did so I just tried adjusting the PPT and VCORE together but the results I got were similar to just adjusting the PPT.

https://imgur.com/OU7BbGV

In the end, I settled with reducing the PPT to 75W for the lower temps and slightly reduced MT performance. I use my PC for games and browsing anyway so it's great to see that the ST didnt change much during all of the benchmarking except when I used a VCORE offset of -0.100V.

Is there anything else I should do for the CPU before I go on to undervolt my GPU?


​

Also, I increased the CPU clock from 36 GHz to 42 GHz and locked the CPU VCORE to 1.25V. I found that I'd crash unless I changed the clock to 41 GHZ. The benchmark results show better MT performance but the ST dips while the temperature increases significantly.

2. unchecked a setting in sound preferences that says some applications can take exclusive control of the audio interface
3. Updated all drivers and software past just the recommended update and all the way to ""optional"" until there were no more updates available.

Now I can not only play video after using Ableton but I can run YouTube and Ableton side by side simultaneously. No green lines, no fake buffer activity, and no crashing. I still want to run GTA V or Sea of thieves at max setting and max frames to see what happens. I was getting green lines before I lowered settings and before the changes.

I’ve got two CPUs for two different systems. One will be mainly for gaming and the other for rendering. 3900x and 3950x. The first cpu has the wraith cooler and ofc the 3950x doesn’t. 

So would you recommend watercooling the 3900x also? Case in which what would be the best solution as in AIO? I’m new to watercooling and I’m not
Really comfortable doing a loop as I have 0 experience. Would do it if I’d find some tutorials or something but I can’t seem to find any in detail stuff.

fby8o0,Loof27,"Screw this new driver. Sincerely, everyone with a blower card","I was perfectly happy sitting with 50c at idle, because the card was whisper quiet. Now, for some reason, they have decided that the lowest speed the fans can go is 20%? Sure, my idle temps have dropped to 35c, but I can hear the card from a mile away now. This is ridiculous, the only reason I went with the blower model was because I read reviews saying it wasn't actually that loud, and the price was lower. Now, it is loud and there is nothing I can do about it.

I would revert back, but these new drivers are really stable for me, so I don't really know what to do",1,1583087333,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fby8o0/screw_this_new_driver_sincerely_everyone_with_a/,Amd,1

&amp;#x200B;

I've gone to install it, only to realise that I don't have the required cables to power it. I needed to find a 8 pin and a 6 pin PCI-e cable to go from my Corsiar CM750M to the GPU. I managed to find a cable that splits to 2 x 6+2 pin, plugged it all in and nothing... looking on the GPU the light above the 6 pin input is blue however the light above the 8 pin input is red, indicating that its not getting power. 

&amp;#x200B;

I currently don't have a work around or any spare cables to play with at this point . I've spent about 4 hours trawling through the depths of the internet to try and find a 8 pin PCI-e and a 6 pin PCI-e and honestly I'm at my wits end. Can anyone give me some advice or link me to the right cables? should I just learn to make my own cables?

I live in the UK if that makes a difference

fbxde7,Dalenmar,Which MOBO for Ryzen 5 3400G? (Budget build),"**So I decided to build new PC for my father, he works in office related software most of the time and also does web browsing.**

I decided to get R5 3400G as it has iGPU and 4/8 cores, and for $150 price (here in Russia) it's the best choice I guess for these purposes. Also while choosing this CPU I was thinking about future proof.

I was thinking about getting R5 2600 or something like that, but I have no dedicated GPU, and also the case will be slim format. Let me know if this CPU is overkill.

&amp;#x200B;

**Build info:**

* New PC build for office stuff and web browsing
* M2 SSD 256 GB, DDR4 8 GB @ 2666 MHz or 3000 MHz
* mATX mobo format paired with slim desktop case (with 300W PSU included)
* Budget is very limited

**The question is:**

* What mobo should I take?
* If A320 based mobo is enough, which model exactly?
* Will R5 3400G on A320 mobo work on boost frequencies?

Unfortunately, since Adrenaline 2020 this was, at least  temporarily, over for the time being. But the community around the Red  BIOS Rebellion Team has of course taken up this challenge.

The result is the RBE (Red BIOS Editor), and so my thanks go to  Hellm, the R.B.R.T. and all the active community members who tested for  days and weeks and reported bugs. The current, first version of the new  tool will allow you to change, adapt and save the BIOS entries of the  Radeon RX 5700 (XT) in a direct way, analogous to the MPT (More Power  Tool). However, there are still some limitations with the other models  at this time and we also assume that everyone first reads the disclaimer  and the preliminary remarks carefully, because what can be realized  with this tool clearly exceeds the possibilities of Wattman and other  tools.

Not only that but Radeon overlay now reports the correct GPU power draw. GPU z shows the correct power consumption also.

Before it required 1.085 mV for 1900mhz, now it works with 1.025

For stability i ran 5 times Superposition and Unigine Valley. 10 minutes of Furmark and a couple hours of gaming. (Witcher 3, Grid 2 and 30 minutes of Insurgency Sandstorm on a local match). I am aware that this in not the right way to stress test but by the time i finished, the sun was up.

Power consumption has reduced by a fair margin and the same can be said for the temperatures also.

GPU blower fan was running 1600-1700 rpm always. I kept the memory clock @ 1820 MHz since its the highest i can get.

fbubit,PayOnce4EntireGame,Something real messed up is happening with the RX 580 with AMD's later drivers (not tech-support).,"I've brought this up a few times before, mostly in replies to other threads but it has gotten to the point now where I cannot ignore it any longer. I have used DDU, I have changed various settings / variables. It's endless and yet, only some games do it. The rest are fine.  

So what's the problem? Overlays. Anything that must render a separate entity over the top of other hardware accelerated graphics will either cause an FPS drop for no good reason (checked HWInfo64 and logging) or cause serious stutter mimicking FPS drops. I'll give some examples... and do bear in mind that this could either be AMD's horrendous drivers or Windows 1909 update. Example time:  

1) If you use a shortcut to incease your volume as I do, you'll get a little rectangle in the top left of the screen showing a vertical slider. This UI element, when it overlays certain games, such as Sea of Thieves, it causes the FPS to drop slightly and the game to stutter like crazy until a second later when the element fades away and like the snap of a finger, performance went from horrid to blisteringly fast. Why does it do this? This also happens in Guild Wars 1 (DX9). Probably happens in some other titles too.  

2) I've noticed today after revisiting Dark Souls 3 that another sort of overlay, this time part of the game, can cause severe performance loss. I go from 60fps in Lothric Castle and shortly before turning left and dropping off of a ledge I read a sign somebody has left (a gold one from many eons ago). That message window alone dropped my FPS from a smooth 60 to 42. Hmm, weird, right?  

3) Windows notifications. Much like the volume slider, if a notification within Windows 10 pops up, be it an e-mail, a system notification, an in-game achievement from Windows Store games (from the likes of Sea of Thieves). This too will cause colossal FPS drops and/or stutter.  


Bit of info, I am overclocked. I have cleared it and it's the same. Both on the GPU and CPU. I am no where near thermal throttling. I have adequate cooling and ventilation. My board is not overheating. My VRMs are rather cool. My PSU is A-OK.  


My System:  

AMD Ryzen 5 1600X @ 3.875, 1.3v - OC or not (automatic), doesn't remedy the situation.  
Gigabyte AX370 Gaming K7 (rev 1.0) - same BIOS I have used for 16+ months (F22).  
TeamGroup Dark Pro - 2 x 8GB 3200MHz (Dual Channel Mode).
  
Sapphire RX 580 8GB Nitro+ powered by 8 &amp; 6 Pin. Overclock uses standard voltages + 20% on the power limit. OC is 1440 / 2200. Removing said OC doesn't remedy the situation. Boosting voltage on last phase does nothing.

500GB Samsung 850 EVO SSD - OS is installed on this drive, including Sea of Thieves &amp; Guild Wars 1.  

1TB Seagate Barracuda 7,200 SATA drive - Dark Souls 3 is on this drive.  
Seasonic Focus Plus 850W Gold  


Other things I have done:  


- Removed all OCs. Though this issue happened prior to any manual overclocking.

- Tried numerous drivers, using Display Driver Uninstaller in between, whilst using safe mode and whilst being disconnected to avoid automatic Windows updates. Earliest driver I tried was October.

- Factory reset AMD software (again) and kept all settings at default.

- Disabled FreeSync.

- Disabled Virtual Super Resolution.

- Disabled GPU scaling.

- Disabled Integer scaling.

- Disabled Enhanced Sync.

- Enabled tested and disabled Windows' own VRR compatibility option in settings.

- Reinstalled Windows 10 (on SSD).


Now this is really starting to piss me off because this has been going on months now and the only conclusion I can come to is that it is either Windows 1906 or 1909 updates, AMD drivers (which have a ton of problems) or these games not liking 144Hz monitors when said monitor is capped to 60hz and an overlay (Windows ones especially) are trying to run at 144hz over a game running at a framerate below 144hz.

I am fairly certain that it is not a fault with my hardware. It doesn't seem to happen in all games and the performance in all of the games I play is stella, up until the point something is introduced that Windows or the GPU doesn't like. I'm leaning toward there being some kind of issue between 144hz desktop mode and games running at 60hz, when an overlay from the desktop environment interferes. Though this doesn't appear to explain the Dark Souls 3 in-game messages in certain areas causing problems, but then again that could just be DS3 since there's lots of posts online from people complaining about performance problems.

There is a major issue going on and it's given me the idea to cap my desktop refresh rate to 60hz and try Sea of Thieves (I usually play SoT at between 80-100fps). VSync is off in all of my games. I'll give a few of these things a try and report back but if this doesn't remedy the situation then I give up.

Are any other people experiencing similar issues, whether you are AMD or Nvidia users? Anybody with high-refresh rate monitors having issues with games or Windows itself?

Everything was much easier a year ago.

Just to note: 6 months ago I didn't seem to have any of these issues. However, 6 months ago I did not have a 144hz monitor. Windows is definitely set to the native resolution and the clearly supported 144hz mode. Then again 6 months ago we didn't have an array of bad AMD drivers causing headaches for a lot of people and a bunch of Windows updates.

Sorry for the long post but I thought it best to paint the whole picture, instead of following an array of suggestions from people that I've likely already tried.

fbrzqc,Kalcomx,Ryzen 3950X HWInfo reported CCD2 Tdie sensor Max 204.9c,"I just spotted HWInfo reporting extremely high single temp sensor max along its tables. I believe its a sporadic sensor oddity. I had kept HWInfo running in background after some stresstests and noticed oddity in temp sensors good while after any real tests (system had been mostly ""idle""). CCD2 max temp is claimed to be 204.9c, when nothing around it indicates such a thing.

I had ran Cinebench R20 with PBO/AutoOC on, that gets the CPU to 212w, but the temps are around 86c as in line with everything else. Repeating the run normally keeps CCD2 in line with others.

fbrowy,Dudeski23456,Can I boost Single core performance?,"Hey, I don't know much about computers but I've got an AMD 9590 clocked at 4.7GHZ. when I bought it at the time (around 4 years ago) I was told it was a beast. But nowadays not so much, I'm being told time and time again when I have performance issues in games like GTA V, Cemu emulator (mainly BOTW) and titles that I should be easily steamrolling, I'm barely getting 40-50fps on the lowest settings. For example I had GTA V running on lowest settings with the resolution at 1440x900 and it's still barely reaching 60. Having played the game when it first came out I know for a fact it performed better. Is there any way to change this shoddy performance? My graphics card is a gtx 980 so nothing special but I know it can still push out medium settings on red dead 2 no problem. And I've got 32gb ram so I know that's not the issue. Thanks in advance and sorry for the sloppy post, if there's anything I can do let me know.

TLDR; Can I boost Single core performance, my FPS is lagging in games that it used to run perfectly fine a couple years ago with no change in pc parts since.

For what I can't decide is which Ryzen 4000 APU should be enough for code compling performance and some other tasks like light video editing/photoshop and older title games (ie. Stardew Valley, Sonic games, Remember Me). I currently have 280-ish$, but I might have it more in the next 4 months.

Is Ryzen 5 4600U enough for these tasks? Or should I get Ryzen 5 4600H/ Ryzen 7 4700U/ Ryzen 7 4800U instead? Also, does RAM speed effect code compling performance?

Share your experiences/recommendations.,"For the past month of so I have read a lot (and I mean a LOT) of posts and articles and read/watched a bunch of reviews regarding all kinds of motherboards for the Ryzen 3000 series, from B450 to X470 to X570 from MSI, Asus and Gigabyte.

If I were to upgrade today, I would chose either the R5 3600 or the R7 3700x, and I have no intentions of upgrading to anything beefier than that, so R9 is something I wouldn't need/want in the foreseeable future. Gaming is probably my most intensive workload, however I also do quite a bit of C/C++ development which does not require a lot of processing power, but compilation times would benefit with a beefier processor. Still, nothing that warrants an R9.

I usually upgrade once every 3\~5 years. My previous processor was the 2500K with I used without issues on a Z68 Gigabyte motherboard. That CPU is still running (since 2011) as my HTPC. My current CPU is an i7 7700 (non k) on a H270 Asus mobo that has been running for a little over three years also without any issues, paired with a GTX 1070 Ti. Before that I had two Phenom chips (x3 720 and x4 965 on Asus mobos) and even before that an Athlon 64 3000, which have also been great systems regarding stability (not to mention my K6 processors). Since I am not in the US nor the EU, I tend to be very picky about my components since RMA is something that can be problematic, and all of the aforementioned systems I have put together have been stable from day one.

I am no stranger to AMD, however, it has been difficult to reach a consensus on witch motherboard to go. Ideally, I would like the idea of a B550 mobo given that I don't really need PCIe 4.0. I believe the B550 would be great due to native Ryzen 3000 support, unlike B450/X470 which requires an up to date BIOS. However, B550 is nowhere to be found and I believe it will probably be skipped altogether in favor of X670/B650 at this point. Still, most mobos based on these older chipsets already chip with updated BIOSes or, if the mobo supports it, I could use BIOS flashback to get it up and running. The features of X470 are also of no interest to me, as I run a single GPU. So, it is either B450 or X570.

Regarding B450, the most recommended boards are from MSI due to their good VRMs, namely the Tomahawk (MAX) or the Gaming Pro Carbon AC (this latter being my favorite regarding features). However, after reading countless threads on /r/MSI_Gaming, both boards still suffer from BIOS issues that affect post times, XMP, post loops, etc. People report perfectly working configurations simply breaking for no apparent reason out of the blue, requiring BIOS reconfiguration or a complete reflash to get around their problems. Needless to say, this does not inspire much confidence on MSI B450 mobos, as even on their official forums you can find stories from users suffering from these same issues with up to date BIOSes. Still on B450, there is Asus, which apparently does not like keeping their BIOSes updated, and Gigabyte, which seems to be a hit or miss regarding system stability, with many reports on /r/gigabyte regarding cold boot issues, probably related to memory configuration, that are yet to be resolved. However, Gigabyte boards seem to report solid stability once up and running.

Then there are the X570 mobos. Even though I have no need for PCIe 4.0, I would be willing to use one given their native Ryzen 3000 support and overall great build quality, with the exception of most MSI models regarding their VRMs. However, my main concern regarding these motherboards stems from the cooling solutions of the chipsets. Ideally, I would use the Gigabyte X570 Aorus Xtreme with its passive cooling, but there is no way I am paying that much for it. The MSI MEG X570 Ace is also a nice option with its heatpipes and semi-passive cooling, it just sucks that it only has 4 SATA ports (which would suit my current needs, but there would be no room for expansion). Asus seems to have terrible fan placement where the fan is located underneath the GPU, with the Strix X570-E reportedly [reaching 88ºC](https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?114494-Strix-X570-E-at-88-5-%B0C-while-gaming!!!) while under load. There was also a photo showing that the heatsink used on this board does not fully cover the chipset, but I cannot find it now. The Gigabyte boards, however, seem to be of good quality, however I can still find several posts on /r/gigabyte, their official forums and [other places](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxQg7HiO0XA) regarding cold boot issues that are yet to be fixed. I could provide more and more links to these observations I have made but let us leave it at that for now.

It is easier to find issues online than success stories as people with working systems most of the time do not bother to report them. However, all current AMD options seem a bit hit or miss from my perspective. The processors are great, but it just looks like the microcode/firmware (BIOS) aspects are somewhat lacking in terms of stability for Ryzen 3000. I never had such concerns before regarding AMD chips, but there weren't as many options before regarding chipset compatibility with so many CPU generations. However, upgrading to newer Intel chips don't seem like such a great idea. Despite their stability due to an already old architecture, their performance comes from boosting their chips with absurd clock speeds, resulting in excessive energy consumption that violates their own TDP specs, despite Intel's multitude definitions for TDP depending on who is winning the CPU race.

TL;DR:

I would appreciate if anyone could share their opinions and experiences with B450/X570 mobos and a Ryzen 3000 CPU. Do you still have issues with current BIOS versions? Which mobo is considered a ""safe"" choice? I know there is silicon lottery involved with any piece of hardware, but there is also always a safer path to chose.",14,1583032498,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fbo0ym/which_motherboard_for_ryzen_3000_share_your/,Amd,1

fbndmp,bobob09,How much lag from control input to GPU output?,"Ive been watching battle nonsense vids on anti-lag and it was really insightful but Im left wondering how much processing lag actually exists under the best circumstances of the games he tested (frame limiter,  anti-lag off, v sync off) or any game for that matter

In overwatch at 60 fps from mouse input to display output this was:

55 ms max

41ms avg

34ms min

His method of testing is using high speed camera and recording the display from G402 click (negligible \~1ms lag).

Are these numbers including display processing lag? (VG248QE , 23ms)

Now the confusing part is fps and refresh rate,  
At 60 fps depending on when press the input the frame could be refreshed by the GPU almost instantly or 16ms later, on top of processing lag... 

Now that frame is sent to the display, would that mean that the display, on top of processing lag , would add its own frame lag? e.g its free running

If the display was running at max refresh rate (144Hz) then that potential lag, would be between 0ms and 7ms.

If we can fill in the blanks then it be a bit easier to deduce the actual lag.

If its compensating for display processing lag then that would suggest the minimum lag (34ms) would be the lag during a perfectly synced frame, and the display is  so 34ms is actual PC processing lag.

If its not compensating for display lag then actual PC latency could be 10ms or even less if both gpu and display can add frame lag independantly (since both GPU and display being perfectly synchronised to refresh just after an input would be a rare occurrence)",0,1583029359,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fbndmp/how_much_lag_from_control_input_to_gpu_output/,Amd,1

fblhp1,dexrc,Question: Differences between AMD and Nvidia GPUs,"Hello r/AMD! First time posting here, and I'm seeking information.

First and foremost, I have only used Intel-Nvidia setups, and my next build will be AMD-Nvidia due to the recent happenings with Intel dropping the ball on their security vulnerabilities, having to slash cpu speeds and such. Left a bad taste in my mouth, so I'll be using AMD cpus for the foreseeable future.

However, I was looking to see if a kind soul would be able to either point me towards a resource or put down some highlights on this question: What are the key differences between AMD and Nvidia gpus?

I understand I'm asking this in the AMD subreddit so I may get some bias, but I'd like if possible to get as much unbiased information as possible to make an informed decision as to what I might choose next for my gpu.

I also understand that Nvidia has a lot of their own proprietary tech, and was wondering what AMD has done to combat / compete with that.

Thanks for reading, I'm looking forward to your answers / comments, and I look forward to eventually joining the AMD family! Sorry for the wall of text!

fblcno,DeadMan3000,PSA: Beware if you have a Gigabyte board when installing Win10 1909 (Y3K bug discovered),"When installing Windows 10 1909 on Gigabyte motherboards or any motherboard that can go past the date 01-18-3001 it will result in a lockup at first boot. Even if you set the BIOS to the correct date after the install Windows 10 will continually lockup at the first boot after installation with the incorrect date set and RESET the date back to the incorrect date in the BIOS.

This is bad because when you are building a new system and do not change the date beforehand the motherboard may have the incorrect date set to 01-19-3001 or later by default!

You could end up wasting many hours and days testing and replacing all hardware with the same result when it is a simple bug in both Gigabyte boards and Windows 10 1909.

It affects both AMD and Intel Gigabyte boards from what Carey has discovered.

fbkw7n,aidanabouttobedead,Constant AMD Driver crashes,"Hi all, I've been having an issue with my pc where any time i try to run a game it will crash, and tell me there is a gpu driver error.

This happens in:

Apex Legends, Overwatch, Rocket League, Black Desert Online and other games that my pc should be able to run easily.

The specs of my pc are:

550W psu, Radeon RX 590 Fatboy 8gb edition, intel core I5 9400f, 16gb of 2666mhz ddr4 ram and a 2tb Firecuda sshd.

I have tried clean installs of windows and drivers and do not overclock the graphics card or cpu, I have also updated my BIOS software but to no avail.

I hope someone can help me here as its really frustrating me as i was excited for my new pc",2,1583018055,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fbkw7n/constant_amd_driver_crashes/,Amd,1
fbkuqv,Lockit14,Updated from Ryzen 5 2400G to Ryzen 7 3700x and now get Blue screen of death?!,"So this is my pc build     https://pcpartpicker.com/user/lockit14/saved/zPWHBm 
 
 I am new to building, and wasn't having issues with the 2400G, but ever since upgrading GPU from 960x to the 1660 super, i now have blue screen after 30m, up to an hour an a half.  
 
 I don't know what's causing it, or what exactly i can do to narrow down the reason.  
 
 I did update my bios to 3.30 before adding the 3700x, since that's the update for my motherboard that started supporting this gen ryzens",4,1583017882,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/fbkuqv/updated_from_ryzen_5_2400g_to_ryzen_7_3700x_and/,Amd,1

fbksea,Lantirre,Should I buy RX 5700XT?,"I'm building a PC for both gaming and amateur designing (3Ds Max, SolidWorks, Blender, Unity etc. I'm planning to improve myself in these kind of softwares and stuff). I got a Ryzen 5 3600 and am looking for a mid-range GPU that could suit my needs in a maximum 400-450$ price tag. I heard that 5700XT has some chronic issues. So I thought about the 2070 super but it's way over my budget if I pick a model with a good cooling, which I have to, since I live in a hot climate. In conclusion, I need to convince myself to buy the Asus Rog Strix 5700XT to finish my PC and I seek your help for this. I would appreciate every comment. Thanks.
