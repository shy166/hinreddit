fso9w7,Pennywise-Wu-Ha,Battle mode seems really unbalanced,Any one else feel like battlemode favors the demons over the slayer? It’s really frustrating to play as the slayer when the demons can summon an infinite amount of enemies and run away when their partner dies. Whenever I kill one demon it becomes a game of duck duck goose looking for the other demon that is running and/or hiding. Not to mention when they get you to low damage they can block your loot which can be really frustrating. It’s not really fun to play as the demons either because it’s usually a 3-0 sweep every time.,29,1585698531,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fso9w7/battle_mode_seems_really_unbalanced/,Doom,0

fso4fh,Der_Marc3l,How to get max lvl in Doom Eternal in the fastes way,"Hello, I saw a lot of people asking me how i got lvl 250 so fast so i decided to make a quick guide how to get max lvl in the fastest way possible (SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD)

1. Complete the Campaign.
2. Get the following  the following Cheat codes: Infinite Ammo, Powerup Onslaught, Powerup Overdrive. These are the Cheat codes you 100% need but the more Cheat codes you got the easier it will be.
3. Launch the mission Sentinel Prime with the cheat codes, for each completion it will give you 1 slayer lvl. It scales with every new lvl you get.
4. Things that make you faster are: Ballista when shot will launch you backwards, use that on some of the open straight parts of the mission; If you have unlocked it, the Unmaykr on the gladiator, it kills him faster than the bfg and the crucible sometimes bugs out and leaves him on one HP, also as soon it says mission completed (after skipping the cutscene) go to the main menu and and select the mission from there again it is faster when going to the Fortress of Doom. If you are really fast and have the game on a SSD (because of load times)

You can get (5 lvl in 12mins) or  50 lvl in 120mins also 

Here is a Video that shows what you need to do:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmrldBYFH6g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmrldBYFH6g)

fsnvoi,pastalegion,What is the Praetor suit?,"I didn't see any codex entries explaining what it was any further then 2016. 2016 lore said it was made from DOOMGuy's armor by a demon known as the wretch for the slayer. 

DOOM Eternal though has a number of Sentinel-connected individuals who have similar looking armor, the Betrayer and the Marauder corps. The Sentinel training armor also is similar to the praetor suit. The Slayers Praetor suit is also able to interact with the throne room in Argent D'Nur, so it definitely seems Sentinel in origin now.

But its not the Night Sentinel armor, as thats still the white Knight like armor. Which leaves a lot of questions.

fsngoj,dainebag,Amazing game but the ending was somewhat disappointing...,"Alls it needed was an outro that was equally as badass as the intro to the game. 

Sure the IOS fight was mediocre and the fact we never got a little tease or cliffhanger from Samuel Hayden or anything about vega was a bummer but I can live with that. 

What bothers me is the fact that the end cutscene just felt so underwhelming in comparison to the first. That intro to the game gives me chills. 

At the end, the music even kicked in oddly, while the voiceover was still talking rather than as the DOOM ETERNAL title popped up. It just felt very rushed. He just walks off, which in itself is fine. That doesn’t bother me. It’s how it was presented. It could have felt much more epic. 

And then to top it off, the credits were just... credits. Very lacklustre in comparison to 2016’s!

Many will disagree I know. But I dunno, I just didn’t quite get that “FUCK YEAH!!! I DID IT!” feeling.

Aside from that though? It’s one of my favourite games of all time. Fantastically crafted and insanely fun. I’m sad it’s over. I can’t wait to start it again on nightmare.",14,1585695674,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fsngoj/amazing_game_but_the_ending_was_somewhat/,Doom,3

fsne3b,woofle07,The Doom Slayer in Smash Bros: a hypothetical move set,"I’ve been playing a lot of Doom Eternal lately, and as such I’ve been thinking up a Smash move set for the demon killing lad who was instrumental in making FPS games as prominent as they are today. 
 
As far as costumes go, he would have 4 of the Doom Eternal design, in green, white, black, and gold, (the default, Astro, Midnight, and Phobos skins) and 4 classic Doomguy skins, in green, red, blue, and brown. 

The Doom Slayer’s main mechanic would be an ammo management system, similar to that of Robin and Inkling. He would have three ammo types: shotgun, plasma, and rockets, with each type belonging to one special and one smash attack each (plus a shotgun aerial). Ammo can be refilled after losing a stock or by hitting an opponent with his down special: the Chainsaw. Many of his normals, aerials, and throws are based on various glory kills from Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal, but without the gore and dismemberment, obviously.

**Standard attacks**
 
Jab: a one-two-three combo of jab, left hook, and push kick
 
Forward tilt: a hammer fist punch (AKA the “bonk” glory kill), launches at a low forward angle
 
Up tilt: a strong standing uppercut, launches up and away
 
Down tilt: a low sweeping kick that pops the opponent up with low knockback. A good combo starter. Has the ability to trip at low percents. 
 
Dash attack: lowers his shoulder and dash boosts forward, launches at about 20 degrees from vertical
 
Neutral aerial: swings Doom Blade in a vertical circle around his body from front to back
 
Forward aerial: winds back and extends Doom Blade, then thrusts forward. Long start up, but very strong
 
Back aerial: turns and shoots Super Shotgun behind him. Uses one shell. When out of ammo, he can still strike with the blades of the meat hook, but the range and kill power are greatly reduced
 
Up aerial: slices overhead with Doom Blade
 
Down aerial: a strong, two-foot stomp. A powerful spike

**Throws**
 
Pummel: very aggressive and angry punches

Forward throw: stabs the opponent with the doom blade then kicks them away
 
Back throw: turns around while holding enemy then slashes their throat with doom blade
 
Up throw: knees the enemy’s stomach then follows up with an uppercut blade slash
 
Down throw: slams the opponent to the ground, then stomps their head
 
**Smash Attacks**
 
Forward Smash: Super Shotgun – Doom Slayer fires his trusty super shotgun directly ahead of him. Has a sweetspot directly in front of the barrel, with the further away hitbox dealing less damage. If uncharged, fires only a single shell, but when charged (even if only partially), it fires a double blast that uses 2 shells. When out of ammo, the move is replaced by a forward stab using his wrist blade. Less range and power, but deals uniform damage.
 
Up Smash: Heat Blast – The Slayer aims his Plasma Rifle straight up and fires a burst of excess heat. It has a large hitbox, with a sweetspot close to the barrel of the gun. Each charge level uses a different amount of plasma: 15 uncharged, 20 partially charged, 25 fully charged. Higher charge levels also have a larger primary hitbox, but the sweetspot remains the same size. When out of ammo, the move is replaced with an overhead stab using the Doom Blade, with less range and power, but deals uniform damage.
 
Down Smash: Rocket Launcher – Doom Slayer fires a rocket at the ground in front of him, much like Snake’s f-smash. Unlike Snake though, this move actually fires a projectile, so if you stand at the edge of the stage, you can fire a rocket downward to attempt to intercept a recovering fighter. Only uses 1 rocket ammo, regardless of charge level. When out of ammo, move is replaced with a low swipe of the Doom Blade. Less powerful than the rocket, with less forward range, but is able to hit behind him.
 
**Special moves**
 
Neutral B: Plasma Rifle – Doom Slayer fires a stream of plasma balls forward. If you hold B, you can move forward and backward and also jump while continuing to fire. Due to the very high rate of fire, this move deals no knockback, and very little damage per shot, about 0.4% per plasma ball. However, it does do increased shield damage, being able to break a full shield in about 3 seconds of continuous fire. Uses 1 plasma cell per shot. Cannot be used when out of plasma ammo.
 
Side B: Rocket Launcher – Doom Slayer shoots a rocket. If you just tap B, he will fire a regular rocket, but by holding B, the launcher will lock on to an opponent (detection area similar size to that of Palutena’s Auto-Reticle), and then fire a homing rocket after releasing the button. The homing rocket is a bit weaker than the standard variant, and both use 1 rocket ammo. Cannot be used when out of ammo.
 
Up B: Meat Hook – the Slayer pulls out his Super Shotgun and fires the Meat Hook. It can be used to tether to ledge. Or if it hits another fighter, he will reel himself in to the opponent, then blast them with the gun, launching them up and away. Uses 2 shells per shot. When out of shotgun ammo, the meat hook can still be used, but there will be no shotgun blast after hooking an opponent. If you still have your midair jump before hooking an opponent, you can use it after.
 
Down B: Chainsaw – Doom Slayer swings his chainsaw in front of him. If it connects, it triggers the second part of the attack, where the Slayer holds the chainsaw steady, while the opponent is hit by a multi-hit attack with a powerful launch to finish. A burst of colorful glowing orbs sprays out of the opponent, instantly refilling the Slayer’s ammunition back to full. The move functions as a command grab that cannot hit through shield, like Terry’s Buster Wolf, so only one person can be chainsawed at a time. Slayer also has super armor while in the chainsawing animation.
 
Final Smash: BFG-9000 – Doom Slayer pulls out the Big Fun Gun, and fires a huge glowing blob of green energy forward. Anyone at 60% or higher will be instantly KO’d when hit directly. The energy ball will also shoot green lightning bolts at anyone nearby, stunning them and dealing damage. Anyone who was at 100% before being hit by the energy bolts will also be instantly KO’d
 
And that’s about it. As far as his stats go, he’d be a quick semi-heavyweight, around Samus and Yoshi’s weight. His fast air speed would be balanced out by a below average midair jump and linear recovery. As far as his ammo capacity goes, I didn’t want to put a hard number on that, because that comes down to a balancing issue. But basically his play style would primarily a close quarters rush-down fighter with a few good zoning tools. He’d be at his most oppressive when his weapons all have ammo, since they provide him with all of his ability to strike from a distance as well as a majority of his kill moves. However, zoning out opponents can’t be a permanent strategy, so he’ll have to get up close and personal with the chainsaw every so often to keep himself at full power.",4,1585695414,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fsne3b/the_doom_slayer_in_smash_bros_a_hypothetical_move/,Doom,6

But Hayden locks you up and continues his plans to harvest it for Argent and for earth's sake (I haven't played it since 2016 so I may be misremembering). 

Then in this one we learn that what we think is Heaven is just the Makyr's land. So is there a ""god"" or was it just Asajj Ventress (the main villain?). And heaven and hell made a pact to both claim souls and put their powers together. So why does heaven have Hell's icon of sin? And what exactly even is the icon of sin? Why are heaven's forces/populations so bare? What do we know about this alien/fictional hell &amp; heaven from Doom and how it relates to our current popular Catholicism? 

Does this make canon the first two original Doom games? Like after Doom II was Doomslayer captured and turned into a sentinel? Are Marauders sentinels turned into demons from the hell-heaven pact? 

What happened to Hayden and why is he like ded

- Weapon mod/mastery changes(make microwave beam mastery so the beam can have multiple streams/jump to other demons if they are close enough)


- Mix elements of 2016 with Eternal (make the ammo count a little higher [28-30 shotgun shells when ammo is fully upgraded sounds better], use some of 2016's demon models like the revenant, weapons can be found on/in corpses)


- Maybe keep purple goo, but let us dash through it


- Being able to use that Jaeger mech in the Fortress of Doom at some point


- Marauder's shield could be breakable


- Rework extra lives(they refill health to full AND give some ammo and armor when used)


- Chainsaw still recharges one pip


- Make it less cartoony, like changing the headshot sound

Edits:
- A L4D type of game mode where players have to fight through demons to reach a safe zone

fslmq7,phobos876,"Since it's apparently okay to talk about the previously-leaked art book, i feel like sharing some of my opinions on it. Also SPOILERS! (Long)","These comments were some i already made during the leak, so i tried to edit some to feel more relevant.

Again, spoilers for both the game and book.

* Doomguy looks great here, but but for reason he looks odd in the final game.

* Some cool looking Sentinel viking helmets.

* Somewhere after the Betrayer and before the muscular dude (Betrayer concept, maybe), they show what looks like a space ship.

* After the Zombieman page, there's these demons and weirdos with shields and arm cannons, they look cool (Like all of them should've been used somewhere).

* UAC zombie with hair.

* I like some of the explosive zombie concepts with the weird thing that has trapped souls inside it, along with chains and a head cage (Better be in some future expansion).

* Pain Elemental was supposed to drop souls after death?

* Carcass was supposed to be something else.

* Whiplash with saggy breasts (I thought it was once supposed to have a more female human like figure like the D3 Vagary and that techno lady model from Doom 64).

* Also, Whiplash supposedly being more snake-like.

* Lots of weird designs, one carrying a book.

* Where Gargoyles supposed to be more related to warriors with that gear and all?

* Gladiator's shield literally bleeds (Not anymore it seems) because it has someone's soul in it and his mace had an energy chain.

* Gladiator's alt designs were experimental as fuck.

* DH as an actual tank, like the Doom 3 Sabaoth (Tank demons are cool).

* A more classic HK merged with his new iterations and some fire Baron concept.

* Interesting Tyrant stuff, not sure why they didn't keep him a hoove instead of toenails(?).

* I like these Hell Priests that look less human/normal like the flying fat guy, these are the kind of designs that could have been used (Maybe in some future DLC).

* This Hell Royality big guy, probably future DLC, looks neat.

* Same for these 4 guys, at least the fourth one (big metal block skull thing) is already in the game.

* The Icon himself, there was even concept of Doomguy fighting it alongside Sentinel warriors i think (His model showcase in the game doesn't show him without armor or the full body).

* Zombie Titan.

* This grey Maykr looks weird.

* Praying Maykrs and a bunch of weird designs, the 3 ones below look interesting.

* More weird Maykrs, i like the tentacle brain guy and the one below him.

* Weird thing with a spear, teeth and eyes and some Maykr shooting a beam: Where they meant to replace the Hell Razers?

* Kahn Maykr herself, with back and front views and a full reference of her wings i think.

* Marauder was supposed to look closer to DG.

* Hell on Earth but with 2016's demons.

* Train.

* Floating gorenest, looks like a flesh Hell dimension.

* Argent Tower on Earth?

* Neat Gore Key designs and apparently a canned animation? This stuff could have been level props, would like to see them used in a future campaign.

* Was the UAC supposed to control the planet?

* Crucible.

* Hayden and the ARC, alongside mechs and Plasma guards.

* Phobos (with green lights in the moon) and BFG10K development.

* This BFG10K area is where you get the BFG9000.

* We even see the inside of the BFG10K or the parts of the cannon, when DG shot Mars.

* Destroyed Mars where you can see the inside with bones and structures of buildings(?), so Hebeth.

* ARC mechs.

* A Sentinal planet.

* Sentinel doorway where you can see some statue i think.

* Stained glass windows and that gift of Argent energy thing.

* Divinity machine and an armory room for the HUB.

* Apparently, there was concept of another ""IOS attached to a wall"" boss fight. Would love to see it in some future DLC, since i can see a modernized version of the classic IOS fight having differences and i like the look of the room (I think in this same page, we even see some arena that may be related to the Slayer Gates).

* The Sentinel mechs looked even weirder before.

* Giant crosses made of Maykr tech in Urdak.

* A lot of this looked alien, i wonder how long did they thought of this Urdak/Maykr direction and whether or not even thought of some basic Angel/Heaven concepts.

* Climbable Mayrk walls, a automap computer? And that rune item.

* Giant cross that's apparently an archangel? Like a living thing? It shows up in Urdak.

* Crucified Hunter that looks like Kronos from Doom RPG (He's that punchable thing in Cultist Base).

* The Revenant possession room.

* What do cultists need blood for?

* Floating cultist base on space with chains and shit, nice.

* Tower of Babel, is that the D64 pentagram?

* Hell stuff looking nice.

* Maykr props in Hell. Obviously that last room in Nekravol.

* I hope that wagon and upside down cross with the hanging dude stayed, even Doom 3 had that (I think one of them did but still).

* Giant creatures carring some weird stuff like temples or vehicles (Can be seen in the first mission).

*  Buff Totem, a soul stream and four floating Hell structures. I think they all got in the final game, one way or another but some concepts happen to have different versions so only one gets in.

* UAC guards and mechs fighting demons, wonder if in a DLC we could see that in real time.

* Alternate rocket designs for the RL?

* Lots of cool designs for the Unmaykr.

* The Crucible should have kept a chainsaw like blade (And people wanted the Doomblade to be the more chainsaw one).

* Loving these Maykr/cultist slayer skins, specially the cultist one (could've been an enemy).

* Podiums for BattleMode and also new weird characters and a classical DG (I think some of these concepts were used in magazines, in the Fortress of Doom).

* Was Earth supposed to have its own tech seperate from Mars?

* MORE podiums with new themes, they should be in the game and the Egyptian one reminds me of TNT.

* CYBER Marauder.

* Zombie demons.

* Classic Revenant.

* Toy demons.

Tried to talk about a lot of things.

I liked most of it, even if some stuff felt a bit ""too new"" to Doom i guess?

I hope a lot of good stuff shows up somewhere in future expansions/DLC (Same for most cut/concept ideas from other Doom games really) because a lot of the art direction has a lot of things to talk about, even if some were just different versions of the same thing.

fslj06,RelocationWoes,I wish every level in Doom Eternal was like ARC.,"Having beaten the game now twice...

I feel these city-oriented levels really nailed the perfect fusion of Doom 2 and everything they set out to do with Doom Eternal. The platforming aspects feel truly integrated because you're traversing a destroyed landscape.  They're quick and fit right into the flow of progression.

Looking back, about half of the levels really miss the mark for me. Yes, everyone has complained about the platforming. That's definitely a huge, huge problem. Especially those later levels where 90% of the time you're just island hopping across vast empty stretches of nothing. It's so lazy, effortless, meaningless, and and uninspired. Which is a real shame, because the aesthetics and styling are gorgeous. It's just terribly designed from a gameplay perspective.

But what I really love about ARC are the corridors. Everything feels purposeful and real and authentic. This game truly shines in these tight corridors, winding hallways, multi-level and multi-plane sections. They're the perfect way to flow into bigger arenas. There's little break in the action. Your nerves are always up. Your brain is always going. It's flow heaven.

It feels so much more like a modern Doom 2, where you have these massive landscapes and bigger arenas but everything is connected by tight corridors and maze-like hallways equally filled with threats.

I really, really pray that we get some extended campaign made of these types of levels. I could spend countless hours playing something like this.

But as it stands, I'll never, ever play 70% of the levels in Eternal again, which is a shame.. because the art direction is gorgeous and interesting and I'd love to spend time in them again. But not as they are now.",7,1585689384,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fslj06/i_wish_every_level_in_doom_eternal_was_like_arc/,Doom,1

fsldel,CedereNescio,I Want to Like Doom Eternal,"I played Doom (2016) this past week since wanting to play Eternal got me to finally get it. 2016 is a fantastic game -- I have only the most nitpicking critiques of it (like the 3D map movement, which got fixed in Eternal). I started and finished on Ultra Violence and while I died plenty, I always got the impression from the game that I died because I got stuck doing something I knew I shouldn't be doing (hanging out on one side of the map, not exploring to find power ups).

I'm now on Eternal and while I've only gotten to the Cultist Base (also Ultra Violence difficulty) I already feel absolutely overwhelmed by how many mechanics the game has. I find myself not wanting to explore because I don't want even more ammo and recharge counters to manage. It's an intense kind of decision overload. I don't just have a weapon, I have equipment. Not just one equipment, but several that can be used in parallel. And not just several equipment, but mods for each I have to decide how to apply. And not just  weapon/equipment mods, but Runes too which modify the armor. I imagine that once I have mastered juggling all these tools the game will be fun, but in trying to learn I find myself just throwing the kitchen sink at the enemies because there are too many weapons/equipment and I'll just hope something has recharged by now.

Which is it: am I supposed to be focused on moving or stopping to strategize since each enemy has a large discrepancy in how effective various weapons are and ammo is Eternally in short supply? I can't easily do both, so I find myself memorizing encounters to the point of 'I only have two shotgun grenades, so I have to run up here, land it on the cacodemon so I can reach over there and get health, then back to the vantage point to snipe that other guy...'. Each time an encounter ends I'm just thinking 'thank god that's over' rather than feeling like I got better at the game. I can't focus on movement because there are so many other ammo and map constraints (having to climb, purple muk, Mario-like spinning obstacles, etc). 

The designers explained, and reviews I have watched, that the point is to make the player use different strategies, but I feel like there is only ever one precise path to victory, and deviating from that results in death. That is the opposite of encouraging different strategies because most aren't viable. In 2016, I  was allowed to use poor strategies and it made the game harder but not impossible. In Eternal I can't do anything except the one right strategy because the game creates contrived constraints. The lack of freedom means I feel punished for using the wrong tactic rather than rewarded for using the right one.

All this is absolutely contrary to Doom 2016. Eternal has been getting good reviews though, so I realize I'm probably the one doing something wrong and I hope someone can set me straight. I know for games it's pretty hard to give more advice than 'git gud scrub' which is usually appropriate, but Doom Eternal has so such complexity creep that I'm actually wondering if I missed something.",11,1585688900,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fsldel/i_want_to_like_doom_eternal/,Doom,2

fsktpg,benRaffle,"Sigil may fix the continuity error between Doom and Doom II. For this reason, you all can go ahead and count me in when it comes to the list of “people who consider Sigil canon”, and here’s why.","At the end of “Inferno” in Doom ‘93, we see indeed that a portal opens up for DoomGuy, who steps on thru it to find himself home on earth. Then apparently thy flesh consumed commences and battles occur. Okay? 

Then in Doom II the opening backstory in the manual says that DoomGuy came back to earth in a drop pod? Crash landing? Hmmmm. Well I think its clear from gameplay and map design that Thy Flesh Consumed? It ain’t QUITE the earth we know and love. We see some human architecture, but then theres so much abstract and strange. TFC takes place in the cityish structure we see burning in the background in the ending image (found at the end of Inferno AND the end of Thy Flesh Consumed). The language used in the ending text seems to imply also that the location is ambiguous. 

So what I think is that the city is some kind of trick, Doomguy is on his way out of Hell. He kills the spider mastermind in hell, then the icon of sin opens a portal to deceive him, he sees grassy fields of beauty, but then the icon shows him his dead pet 🐇 daisy to instill fear and anger. So Doomguy goes towards the chaos and kills everything he sees. Since this is on the way out of Hell, it could be the outskirts, aka limbo or “the bosom of Abraham”. This is considered a natural (but not supernatural) paradise for the unbaptized who dies without committing sin (such as infants). Maybe hell invaded it, or maybe its just some kind of Earth/Hell illusion. 

Sigil’s backstory reveals to us that after the final spiderdemon is killed in TFC, the icon (aka baphomet, the one who is truly leading this entire invasion as we learn at the end of Doom II) glitches the portal that Doomguy drops in to, sending him to an even DEEPER section of hell, as the final deception and a final goodbye. Unlucky for the icon of Sin, doomguy is not gonna go down without a fight, and we can assume that in hell your body doesn’t require food or sleep since it is timeless and eternal. 

So I am guessing that at the end of the fifth chapel Sigil of The Ultimate Doom, Doomguy is sent back to Mars, where he started before he went to Phobos for Knee Deep in the Dead, and from here he is able to establish contact with his officers on Earth, and hop into a drop ship and fly back home.

fskkgy,marcano-animations,Slayer testaments 1-7,"In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer. Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before. And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the seraphim bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Blood Temples. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the nine circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm. The age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the tablets of Hell across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting. None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the abyss rose The Great One, a champion mightier than all who had come before. The Titan, of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon the plain and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. The Titan fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow horde were routed. And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer in a mighty armor, wrought in the forges of Hell, impenetrable and unyielding. With sword and shield of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void. Yet as the mighty Titan fell and dread engulfed the armies of Doom, the demon priests of the Blood Temples laid a trap to capture this scourge of Hell. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Great One, the Hell Walker sought prey in the tombs of the Blood Keep. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the temple upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering.",1,1585686377,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fskkgy/slayer_testaments_17/,Doom,2

fsk6p8,TommysTonsils,Some Thoughts on the Awesome Ultra-Nightmare Mode,"I'm really taken aback by how fun the Ultra Nightmare mode is in Doom Eternal compared to the 2016 incarnation, which felt like a fun gimmick but not designed to be beaten. If the devs ever read this sub (which most devs seem to do now, so it seems like a fair bet) I just wanted to share a couple thoughts:

Chiefly, it would be a godsend if we could bypass the intro cutscene (completely), and if we could disable the little ""signpost"" movies that play when a door/pathway has opened (typically post-fight, or after puzzle progression). Since most Ultra Nightmare players have already beaten the campaign multiple times, these videos just tend to feel redundant and drag out the often grindy experience of attempting Ultra Nightmare over and over. A big secret to the success of ""die-repeat-die-repeat"" roguelike games (like The Binding of Isaac) is their quick turnaround rate, where death can come quickly but the game lets you immediately restart without a loss in momentum. Some quick tweaks to that effect would make Ultra Nightmare even more fun than it is now!

On that topic, I also wanted to say I welcome ANY more post-game or NewGame+ type modes, because I think the Doom Eternal campaign is absolutely fabulous and I would welcome any chance to replay it in any kind of new context. The Resident Evil games have gotten a lot of mileage out of post-game mutator modes, and I think considering the awesomeness of Doom 2016's arcade mode (which I'd love to see return), this sort of thing has already proven to work awesomely for this series. Bring it on! Most of all, thank you for this once-in-a-generation awesome game.

fsj2bn,BarrattsMini,What’s your best way to take down ‘x’ enemy?,"So I finished my first run of the game on Ultra Violence. Loved it. I’m about to start a Nightmare run and figured it could be good to reach out to others for strategies enemy by enemy I may not be doing. 

For starters I rarely touched the Arbalest or the Pulse Rifle. As soon as a I got the SSG I all but never touched the standard shotgun again. So that’s x6 weapon mods I’ve not really messed with. Even the assault rifle I only used for the scope on the enemy weak points. 

Be great if folks could call out the enemy type and how they approach them? 

First thing to point out is whenever I use a freeze grenade I auto flame belch. With the upgraded freeze grenade you get health on kills. Armour for the flame. 

Whiplash - the easiest way I’ve found to remove them from an encounter is to freeze grenade them and then x3 RL lock. On UV difficulty this = dead. 

Pinkies - blood punch from the front is death. If I don’t have one I tend to only jump over them (double jump) as they can sometimes pull of extreme turns when I dash to the side. Jump over.

It seems strange, but I find the shotgun/sticky combo to be my primary gun 80% of the time.

With a sweet arsenal, I don't want to neglect other stuff.  What do you find to be really useful?  I'm on PC (mouseaim rules), and about halfway through the game.

fsiykv,Nattens-Madrigal,Just beat Eternal for the first time on UV,"Was worried going into it that maybe I should start on Hurt me plenty to get used to the new mechanics first but I'm very glad I started on UV. I think this game is pretty brilliantly balanced actually despite what some people have been saying (yes even Marauder felt balanced). 

There were definitely some encounters I struggled on and it was a steep learning curve but once you learn how the game is meant to be played no other shooter feels better imo except for maybe Doom 2. Once I got to the Icon of Sin I beat it my first try with no extra lives and felt so badass, there were multiple points where I had 10 or less health and thought it was over but I always pulled back somehow.

It was challenging and you are forced to use every tool the game gives you to succeed and I wish more games used this approach to game design (ik not everyone likes it though some just want to spam SSG like in 2016 and that's okay it's just not Eternal). For anyone struggling, ice bombs are crazy op especially after upgrades. I realized this about halfway through the game and it made things much easier. 

I didn't say anything here that hasn't already been said just wanted to share my experience. Doom Eternal is already in my top 5 games ever I loved almost every second, even liked the platforming (purple goo can fuck right off and die tho I just can't justify that one).

fsicgm,LoneDinosaur54,"For all who like DOOM and other fast paced fps games, I give you, Killing Floor 2","This game is probably well known, but the game is dying, at least on pleb consoles. I would highly recommend anyone (who for some reason isn't playing Eternal or Animal Crossing) to check it out

A quick summary of the game: 
Zeds, Dosh, and Big Guns. Story...who cares, you need to survive, pick a perk set before you start a game, I think there's 9, and each perk has its own progression. Once in a game it's a round system like most zombie survival games. After every round you go to a trading pod where you have access to all the weapons in the game, they are purchased using the in game currency, dosh, that is earned by murdering many zombies. You have access to other perk specific weapons, although, using weapons from a different perk category does not earn you xp for your perk. 

The zombies or zeds as they are refered to in game each look unique and attack differently (somewhat) some fodder zeds have knives on their hands that they use to not only kill you, but block headshots. There are sirens who will scream super loud in close range and disorient your hearing and vision. Big bloaters who have two meat cleavers and explode when killed. Scrakes are giant zeds with a chainsaw that will charge you relentlessly when their health has been reduced to a certain point. These are only a few of the many different enemies. 

There are also bosses in the last round of each game, my personal favorite is hanz volter, a German scientist who has two stg 44s and can latch onto you and drain you health while boosting his own. There a few different ones like the patriarch and his daughter the matriarch. 

All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone looking to practice before all these corona virus patients turn into zombies",12,1585679455,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fsicgm/for_all_who_like_doom_and_other_fast_paced_fps/,Doom,2

fshvfb,scottishdrunkard,Regarding the Identity of the Seraphim...,"If Samuel Hayden is meant to be Samur Maykr, the Seraphim, what's with the complete personality shift? 

In DOOM '16, he was corporate. He needed the Argent Energy, to solve the Energy Crisis or his own devices. The Seraphim seems to oppose Argent Energy, so he gives the Slayer the God Power from the Machine, and steals The Fathers essence to spite Khan Maykr. In fact, Eternal Samuel seems to have some of these characteristics, he is telling you why Argent Energy is so bad, yet he gave you the screw job so he could have it. 

Then there is VEGA, when you plugged him into Urdak he asked an existential question, effectively gaining sentience. ""Am I the Father now, Doctor Hayden?"" This begs the question is VEGA the stolen essence of the Father? It would make sense why a massive super-cooled computer was required to house him. But again with Samuel's personality shift, he was willing to explode him to get Doomguy to Hell, didn't even suggest backing him up. There might be a way they could have worked around the personality shift, but id Software were deliberate in shrouding both Samuel and Samur in mystery, so conclusive evidence is not a luxury.

(Spoilers For Mission 12),"Alright, so if you have no crosshairs activated the Precision Bolt also has no screen, it just zooms in a touch. Now up to this point, I just said 'fuck it' and decided I wasted my Weapon Modbot right upfront, and to hell with it. Unfortunately, this is a serious issue towards the end. 

I'm fighting the Khan Maykr and you have to nail headshots on the Maykr Drones to beat this fight. Now I'm good for 3 or 4, and sometimes just get lucky and the whole thing goes down magic. But doing this enough times to get in the requisite punches on the Khan is damn near impossible. At least without a crosshair, half the time I'm firing blind.

Now I know I can activate the crosshairs, but goddamnit I've made it this far without any of that shit. I can't see dropping my iron will and changing settings now! Just needed to vent that.

Hey all, last night I decided to splurge and buy Doom Eternal to maybe keep sane during the whole quarantine madness. All has looked promising so far but I'm running into some issues with my frames. Haven't gone fast the first level yet but so far, primarily in combat and sometimes out of combat my FPS is dipping up and down, regardless if I'm on high presets or low presets. If I had to guess the FPS _can_ max out past 100 but averages under 60, with the worst drops being 30s-40s.

So far I have tried three recent drivers, disabled both Steam and Discord overlays, turned off Windows 10 Game Mode, played around with other settings (example - medium presets but adjusting shadows to lowest setting) and played around with borderless/windowed full/windowed. Vsync settings do not seem to help either.


I'm at a loss here but not sure what else I should do. Eventually I'm looking towards upgrading my rig but that's currently out of question. Any help is appreciated, thanks! \o/",6,1585670331,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fsfgor/having_trouble_with_fps_any_suggestions/,Doom,1

fsfelx,gigicon,Make Savagery Rune speed up chainsaw kills!,"Savagery (Faster glory kills) is by far, my favourite rune, because of how seamlessly the glory kills speed up the flow of combat.

Generally, I have no complaints regarding losses of pace/flow during combat encounters in Eternal. I make sure every single demon always ends up in my way, ready to be torn to pieces and everything runs smooth as butter.

However, once you get used to the speed killing Savagery offers, you quickly realize that the entire bottleneck of the speed and flow is the chainsawing, which remains at the same speed. This can easily be fixed if you allow Savagery once again to speed up the kill animation.

I have also played a lot of battlemode matches, where I chose Master Carver upgrade, which does the same thing - speeds up chainsaw kills - and it was hella fun and smooth chopping demons so fast! And since this context is from a multiplayer game mode with high competitive tendencies, I don't see why it shouldn't be in a Single Player campaign as well.

Technically speaking, a chainsaw kill is still a glory kill. To add more proof, the savagery rune in Doom 2016 did speed up chainsaw kills.

Now, unless there's a clear balance issue that this change might bring into the gameplay, I see no reason not to keep up with the 2016 tradition and make savagery rune speed up chainsaw kills in Doom Eternal too! :)

I'd say this change would just add a new level of speed in the game, for those who really crave an intense and fast flow of combat, but change my mind if, again, you think this will bring any issues.",3,1585670139,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fsfelx/make_savagery_rune_speed_up_chainsaw_kills/,Doom,1

Additionally Hell was allowed to invade worlds by the will of the Makyrs. This means that starting from the very first DOOM game, Argenta had already fallen and the Maykrs were sending hellbeasts to invade other worlds in exchange for Argent energy. And so this means the only way he was able to enter into Argenta based on the flashbacks of Doom Eternal is if he somehow managed to travel back in time. So when Argenta fell the Icon of Sin was created and this means that, based on how time travel works, both versions of the Doomslayer were existing at the same time. One that was trained by the Night Sentinels, and a younger version of himself that had just been teleported to Hell to kill the Icon of Sin. Is this a good thought or am I missing anything?",2,1585667528,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fsem1w/my_understanding_of_the_doom_timeline/,Doom,1

fsefd5,TimArthurScifiWriter,If you think the Marauder breaks up gameplay then you misunderstand what the gameplay is,"I'm seeing this point get made a lot by some big channels, where Doom Eternal gets rave reviews but people are like ""everything's fun except the marauder because he goes against the point of the game.""

He doesn't. He enhances the point of the game. There's a reason Hugo Martin calls him a black belt because he's meant to prove that you understand what the rules are and what the martial art of Doom gameplay is. Instead we have these youtubers with horrible skills and anywhere between a dozen to twenty four hours worth of gameplay spread across a week, telling an audience of hundreds of thousands that the Marauder is bad design.

That talking point will get parroted and before we know it, id will shy away from this type of gamedesign in the future. Even if you look at someone like ByteMe, who's an amazing player, he struggled with the Marauder as well in the beginning. He steamrolls them now. Even if you're a pro player you're not supposed to immediately understand what they're about. There's a learning curve. People have been commenting on them without even having gotten out of that curve to begin with.

If you run into a Marauder, here's the key:

1) You kill him last

2) Don't shoot the shield, don't get a dog

3) You get a dog, you dash to the far side of the arena to let him and the dog come at you from the same direction, dog dies in one shot.

4) Quick weapon rota, burn him down.

Now this all seems incredibly obvious and people will be like ""but I tried that waaaah.""

So here's the point: you keep the Marauder alive and fight him last because the countering-his-attack element literally forces you to. To stick with Hugo's frequent sportscar analogy, if you try to counter a Marauder in the midst of battle, it's like trying to shift up while going into a corner. That's the opposite of what you're supposed to be doing.

Because the Marauder forces you to to fight him one-on-one, he becomes a threat multiplier while he's in the arena. He makes it so that you have to do your usual combat routine against regular mobs at a higher level of efficiency, a greater level of smoothness, and greater speed. He forces you to do what you've already been doing, except harder, better, faster, stronger. If you can't, you die. If you try to kill him before everything else, you die.

He's literally there to force you to be better at doing the regular stuff so you can get to taking him out quicker. That's the whole point. There's not supposed to be an easy way to kill him, because Doom is push-forward gameplay and the Marauder can only be killed if you push forward so hard that you create a moment in time you can dedicate solely to him.

I was some distance into Taras Nabad when I got my ass handed to me by a Marauder, and rather than get upset I realised I just didn't get it. Something about the core gameplay loop of Doom Eternal wasn't making sense to me. So rather than try to advance the campaign, knowing I'd just run into the same stumbling block over and over, I loaded up a new campaign in a new saveslot to force myself to get better at dealing with the general combat loop.

Lo and behold, improvement. Marauders are so fun to fight now. Their presence on the battlefield doesn't elicit an ""oh goddamnit"" reaction from me, they make me rev my engine to redline for an entire arena. That's where the fun is. It's racing. It's speed. It's that Ferrari that Hugo was talking about. You get so good at murdering the fuck out of everything that by the time it's just you versus the Marauder, you already know you've got it.

So to id Software I would say, don't change a thing. Next Doom, keep them in. Or do something similar. But don't cater to people who expect the game to be watered down, please.",89,1585666921,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fsefd5/if_you_think_the_marauder_breaks_up_gameplay_then/,Doom,8

However, I did not buy the game rather I downloaded it through game share with my buddy. My favorite aspects of video games in general is competitive online multiplayer. So when I saw this game offered that I immediately jumped in head first. 

Like most I was trashed by the demons all day before I watched a few videos on the best guns/mods to use. The journey to get good was an extremely fun and intense road and I enjoyed every second of it. I am now around level 25 and its been a few days since I last played a game in the mode. Keep in mind that I play on console WITH a NORMAL controller. Even so before I stopped playing a few days ago I was on a 30 something win streak as the Slayer.

 Since my friend is no-lifeing the campaign I don't have any one to run demon with and find no joy playing them with randoms. However Slayer is extremely fun, until you get to the point where you roll everyone who is not a pre-made red border high level(around 70+) demon duo. The game mode gets pretty boring and repetitive when I am consistently 3-0 ing every match under 5 mins of play. Most of the time now I barely every need to even use my chainsaw to replenish ammo as the ammo I get after I pop a full hp Mancubus in his face at the very start of the match with the Ballista/Super Shotgun combo is more than enough to chase down whatever terrified poor soul is left to fend for himself. 

Now at this point it sounds like I am asking for Slayer nerfs but I still think overall the game mode is very balanced for Console. Whenever I do come across a high-level demon duo who knows what they are doing the matches are intense and still get my blood pumping. But the issue is one of those matches only appears once in every 20-30 games. Which is definitely not worth the amount of fodder I have to brainlessly demolish before I get a good match.

 I believe adding a ranked mode would add an even more competitive nature to battlemode and possibly offer more rewards for taking the time to become a multiplayer doom god. It could possibly also increase the player base as freaks like me will salivate at the chance of climbing a ladder in which I can prove my skills against the very best competition doom multiplayer has to offer. I just see no downside of adding a ranked mode besides maybe que times, but even then my point to ranked possibly increasing the player base, I believe still holds up and could potentially counteract that argument. 

Anyways I want to hear your guys thoughts on the battlemode and your experience so far as well as what you think adding ranked would mean for the mode.",7,1585666782,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fsedrj/battlemode_desperately_needs_a_ranked_mode/,Doom,1

fse7it,TrapnSlap,How do you deal with Mancubus in Battlemode?,"TL:DR: How are you supposed to counter a Mancubus using haste/quick smoke? Also, how are you supposed to counter an Archvile in the mix too?

It seems nobody plays Mancubus in multiplayer but a few people have figured out how to really put pressure on the Slayer. Using Quick Smoke or Haste a Mancubus can basically just destroy the Slayer with fire. What do you do in situation? You can’t dash out of the way because the Mancubus’ range and speed is way to good, jumping is a band aid solution cause if they are even a little good they can follow you, no gun in the game can kill them before they kill you, not even the mobile turret or super shotgun or a direct shot with the BFG will kill them. The only option is to run but you can only try to out maneuver them using monkey bars or use portals to just escape instantly. Jump pads are great cause the Mancubus is slow to climb even with his double jump but not every situation/map will have an abundance of jump pads. I haven’t even mentioned the fact there is a horde of demons and another player you have to juggle. Revenant’s barrage will do enough damage to cripple you and he can easily chase you after his friends haste is over, Pain Elemental is decent and if they can hit their shots and use Lingering Souls they’ll do the same thing as Rev, but Marauder and Archvile... One of them plus a really good Mancubus is just terrifying. Depending on their own skill, Marauders will do just as much dps as the Mancubus and a good/coordinated Archvile will just decimate the Slayer. The area denial of the wall and lake is perfect for cornering a Slayer for easy pickings. There is literally nothing stopping these two. Me and two friends went into a private match and no matter who played the Slayer never won. The combo is just way too good. Unless there is some secret way to defeat these guys, I think Slayer needs a small buff. I’ve been hyping up this combo but tbh the balance of this multiplayer is great from what I’ve seen.",10,1585666155,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fse7it/how_do_you_deal_with_mancubus_in_battlemode/,Doom,2

This doesn't make sense though because I'm in my story play through and can't even use cheat codes. I turned off the cheat codes in mission select, went back to continue story, and now its even more bugged out. The music stays on ambient even though I'm in combat and pressing TAB (upgrade menus and such) does nothing! I really don't want to move past this point without doing the slayer gate, which means I'm kind of stuck.

fscpuc,Thrayn42,Thoughts on Doom Eternal combat,"First background on me: I played through all of Doom 2016 on Ultra Violence, and that was more than hard enough for me. So that gives you an idea of my skill level. I died a fair amount, got better, and generally felt the whole ""I'm not trapped in here with demons, they are trapped with me"" vibe. I played the original Doom when it came out when I was in high school (yeah I'm old), and after the disappointment that was Doom 3 this game just blew me away. It felt like old school doom but better.

So onto Doom Eternal. I'm enjoying it, so far I'm up to where my next mission is to blow a hole in Mars, but there are several things that disappoint me.

1. Punching does no damage, other than blood punch. Early on I went up to one of the fodder zombies and thought I'd just punch it to death to save on ammo. After punching it a half dozen times, I was completely confused. How can the Doom Slayer not punch a zombie to death? If I'm wrong and you can (without bloodpunch), it takes way too long. From a narrative standpoint, it's just wrong; in the opening of Doom 2016 the first thing you do is punch a zombie to death with your bear hands! When running and gunning I generally shotgun imps and such once and punch to do a finisher, but sometimes I'm a bit off and they aren't staggered and I just uselessly punch them. At least in Doom 2016, I would be doing damage and likely stagger them with that punch and just follow up with a finisher. Punching should just be on cooldown unless you have blood punch active, because normal punching does nothing and leaves you vulnerable.
2. I miss the story during gameplay. The cutscenes and log entries you get are great, but in the 2016 game there was more dialog during gameplay. Much of it being Samuel Hayden asking us to do something, and then Doomguy smashing things. From the first, you have Samuel asking to partner up and Doomguy punching the computer screen. Several hours into the game I finally get a taste of that when he tells me not to blow a hole in Mars and then that's my very next quest! I had missed that so much, and wanted to have more of it. It made the early levels feel empty without that kind of dialog. You even meet the betrayer and the Doomguy doesn't react at all. I feel like he should have punched him, or smashed some of his gear, or something. I'm hoping it picks up from here on with Hayden.
3. Combat feels off. I get what the combat loop is supposed to be, and I expect to be mocked for being afraid of the chainsaw. But I played a ton of Doom 2016, and I'm used to the chainsaw being something you save for a big guy. Save up full fuel, get into a tough battle, blow a lot of ammo then chop down a big demon with the chainsaw and get back to blasting. Here the chainsaw is something to be used all the time. On random fodder demons between battles to stock up. It's gone from a big gun I'd pull out on a nasty demon, to something relegated to chewing up fodder for ammo. It just feels wrong. I'm adapting and using it more, but that means I generally don't have full fuel to use it for killing a big guy, which feels more fitting for it. I think I would rather they have your retractable blade as what you use to kill fodder enemies for ammo (and have it on a cooldown like how the chainsaw regenerates one bar if you are out of fuel), then make the chainsaw like in Doom 2016 (no regen of fuel, but can get up to 5 fuel and kill some of the bigger enemies it currently can't kill). And that's another thing: there are demons I could kill before with the chainsaw and can't kill now. It's jarring.
4. Ammo. I've gotten all the ammo upgrades and I'm still always out of ammo. Yes, I should chainsaw more. But it feels weird to run around looking for fodder I can chainsaw. I don't feel like a big badass ""you demons are stuck here with me"" kind of Doomguy. It just felt better getting into the thick of things, running out of ammo, chainsawing the nearest big target, and continuing going to town. Now that just results in me not being able to chainsaw things (seems everything takes 3 fuel other than fodder), so I'm out of ammo, can't chainsaw anything around me since I almost never have full fuel since I'm using it on fodder to stock up, run away and look for something small to kill, etc. It just doesn't feel good to me. I am adapting to it, but it felt like the last game had a better flow.
5. The Maurader. Yes, I'm bad at the game, read my first paragraph. I know everyone here has beat this already on ultra nightmare without dying on their first playthrough, but I'm just not that good. The fight with the first one just felt so weird. Ok so he's immune to my attacks most of the time. The green flash is really fast (I'm an old man remember), but also unpredictable. It took me probably a dozen tries to take him down, and I still couldn't reliably trigger the attack where I could attack him. He'd either throw his axe or shoot me. And so I'm gaging my distance from him trying to bait him into making a move, and if he doesn't do the green flash attack I get hit by the shotgun or axe. And then I'm low health again running scared trying to stagger and finish some fodder, all the time thinking all he has to do is call off his reinforcements and I'd have no chance. Now I was definitely better at fighting him as I kept at it, but it doesn't feel like a Doom fight. I'm not looking forward to fighting more of them. The Doom Hunter feels like a Doom boss: lots of health and big scary weapons, but no immunity to most attacks until he does something. The Maurader feels more like something from Dark Souls or Sekiro (yes, an exaggeration, it's not that hard, but it matches those games gameplay-wise more than Doom).

Well, that's my long rant. A point of view from someone who loves Doom, but has never been great at first person shooters. Doom Eternal is still fun, I will keep playing, but it feels like a step down from Doom 2016 in a lot of ways. I look forward to being called bad, I will enjoy the memes, but I am curious if anyone else feels the same on any of these points.",8,1585660551,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fscpuc/thoughts_on_doom_eternal_combat/,Doom,1

fsc30e,Snow-Throat-Scholar,Floating Maykr on Urdak is the Mother Demon or reveals the Mother demon's identity:Lore Theory,"So on Urdak we find a floating Maykr body unarmored in some strange liquid. 

I was unable to link a picture of the body because I couldn't find a good one, but to me it looks like an updated graphics Mother Demon. Check [this](https://i.imgur.com/52dUTp1.jpg) out. The same main thorax with multiple arms attached and a long head.


At the end of doom 64 the updated ending says that the Mother Demon had a sister who is trying to take you out. I've only seen videos so I'm not sure if the we kill the sister resurrector in the new doom 64 ending or she's still out there somewhere.

In doom 64 we also see the first appearance of the unmaykr weapon. In that game the weapon is specifically useful in the final battle against the Mother Demon. Then we see the Unmaykr return in doom eternal and learn of the Maykr race. Led by the Khan Maykr a female angel like being who leads her entire race. We find out this Khan Maykr made a deal with the Dark Lord and orchestrated building argent factories in hell and worked with hell to strand the night sentinels and Slayer in hell. And that her factories spawn demons as a byproduct.

We also see two unmaykrs just as we see two crucibles, a demonic crucible and a sentinel crucible. We see a Maykr style Unmaykr in eternal and a demonic Unmaykr in doom 64.

It seems from it's name that the Unmaykr was specifically made to destroy Maykrs. 

We also learn of a figure called The Father who is crucial too Urdak and usually chooses the next Khan Maykr but he has disappeared.

Now considering the title of The Mother demon and how similiar she appears to the floating naked khan maykr,  is it possible she was once at the Father's side? Perhaps as the rightfully chosen Khan Maykr. And then at some point she was corrupted by hell and became a demon herself. (It's also worth noting that the Khan Maykr looks demonic herself possibly hinting the entire race is an offshoot of demons.)  Even the name Maykr implies they create things, in the Khan Maykr she creates technological upgrades, but she also spawns in lesser maykrs in combat. Even her priests and angels seem demonic. Perhaps a demonically corrupted Maykr would literally birth demons as a nice twist to their original form. So basically im thinking The Unmaykr was in doom 64 because we fight a Maykr in doom 64-the Mother demon.

So what I'm thinking rn is that at some point The Father was taken by the Seraphim. The Mother was corrupted by demonic energy and became the Mother demon. Doomguy kills the Mother demon and her sister(?) or a new khan eventually becomes The Khan Maykr(depends on doom 64's updated ending and how much time doomguy spent in hell before being found by the sentinels and Khan maykr. 

Or

It could also be the case that doom eternals story is a sort of repeat of the doom 64 story where we get more info on what's actually happening. Like an eternal perpetual cycle that keeps playing out over and over but slightly different each time-and each time the Slayer puts an end to it.  In this scenario the Khan Maykr is following the same path the Mother once followed but she does not ressurect demons in the same way the mother once did and has not been corrupted into a demon herself yet. It's worth noting the Khan Maykr is still responsible for the creation of more demons like the mother was since her argent factories in hell produce more demons. The Khan Maykr like the mother before her makes a deal with the demons to keep the armies of hell populated and thus works with the dark lord. 


Idk exactly how it all fits together but the pieces are all there. The Father, The Mother, and the Unmaykrs. Both the father and the mother are Maykrs. 

Perhaps the body on Urdak is the original Mother demon. Or it could be the Father's body. The orb in it's chest is organic. I could see demonic corruption making the orb the Khan uses into something Organic in the Mother demon.

I don't have HDR enabled in windows either.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  100% confident that the HDR setting is the cause of this fluctuation,  so any questions asking to troubleshoot this are not necessary.

Obivously the FPS drop is pretty severe, and also annoying considering the game is much better with smooth gameplay.

fsbi0c,Trumpeachment,Should I buy Doom Eternal?,"I have memories of playing Doom as a kid, though I was never as into video games as my brother, I loved Doom, the first one, a lot. Playing it on our old crappy computer feels like another lifetime. I haven't kept up to date on Doom or anything much to do with video games. But I love FPS shooters. 

So here we are. I have a decent computer set up (I customized it for mad RAM cause I mix a lot of audio and record my guitar). My PC would do a good job running it. But again, I'm not exactly a gamer.

 I didn't even know this game was on its way until I saw the Joe Rogan interview with the guy who led devs on it or whatever. And I feel like this game certainly has to be a milestone/benchmark in pulp FPS action. I know it can't be bad. But help me justify spending the money on it even though I'm not really a gamer. I feel like it'd complete a prophecy I began as a young kid playing Doom, to now, be playing Doom Eternal. Is the game extraordinarily meaningful and pays tribute to it's predecessors?

fs9oq1,MOARPSYK,"Since we are all at home at the moment, I have been binge watching shows and playing Doom Eternal, but I actually want to know the history to a certain sound effect!","Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

As title says, I have been binge watching shows and playing DOOM Eternal (which is absolutely amazing as you all know), but I have been hearing a sound effect from DOOM/DOOM II in certain media.  


This is the sound in question - DSPOSIT2.wav -  [https://archive.org/details/dsbossit/dsposit2.wav](https://archive.org/details/dsbossit/dsposit3.wav) 

(You may have to save the file to play it)

But the sound is of the Zombieman. The sound is instantly recognizable.

&amp;#x200B;

I have heard it in a couple of movies, one being Clown (A horror film, in the arcade part you can hear the sound briefly)

BUT...it appears in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers in the Second season with the Thunderzord assemble. You can see a clip here -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brhiame\_oS4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brhiame_oS4) 

The sound is audible at 0:40, buried underneath the music etc. But it's there.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my question. Where did the sound effect originate from?

If it was made for DOOM and then pieces of media used it as a generic monster sound (or megazord sound in the example above) and never credited the source.

Or, if it was an existing sound effect from another piece of media and id Software/Bobby Prince used it in the game.

I see Prince being the person who made the sound effect as he did with the rest of them but I am just curious to see if it was a sample or made from scratch straight up?

&amp;#x200B;

fs9juv,vuzz33,Combo to deal quickly with cyber-mancubus.,"They're probably the worst among the heavy class and can also take so much punishment before going down. The blood punch is a good way to break their armor but you will always be hurt by his ground pounding. So here a simple combo to avoid that (without super-weapons or chainsaw):

1. You lock him with your meat hook. That way you can quickly reach him without traversing half the arena by foot. *It's better if you have the super shotgun mastery as it will put him on fire and will give you additional armor shards.*
2. Freeze him with a grenade when you're mid-air to prevent him from repelling you.
3. Blood punch him to destroy his armor. *Use your flame-thrower before the blood punch if you don't have the super shotgun mastery.*
4. Since you're already equipped with the super-shotgun, finish him with it. *I one-shot him with the ""damage buff on frozen enemies"" perk. If you don't have it, it will probably take you one or two more shots.*

And that's it! With that technique, you can finish a cyber-mancubus in seconds as-well-as replenish your health and armor, and without wasting ammo!

I just cannot seem to crack those two Mancubi in the time limit, trying all sorts of different weapon and equipment combinations.

- Combat shotgun, both mods

- Heavy Cannon, both mods

- Plasma Rifle, Heat Blast only

- Rocket Launcher, Lock-On Burst only

- Super Shotgun, fully mastered

- Ballista, both mods

fs8pea,dv_,[SPOILERS] Question about the Slayer's backstory,"Doom Eternal confirms that the Slayer is Doomguy from the original DOS games. Okay.

To sum up what I know: Doomguy's UAC performed experiments with slipgate technology, and accidentally opened slipgates to hell. This went out of control in Doom 1, and in Doom 2, wrecked Earth. Doomguy saves the surviving humans, and then literally goes to hell to stop the invasion from there.

Later on, after Doom 64, he somehow ends up in Argent D'Nur, and is eventually supercharged by the Seraphim. He continue to raze hell until he is entombed by hell's forces. Millennia later, Hayden's expeditions to hell find him.

But does this mean that there are *two* Earths in canon? The first Earth where Doomguy came from, and Hayden's Earth? In Doom 2, Earth is already ruined, while in Doom 2016, Earth is still okay. Also, Doom and Doom 2 never showed anything about Argent Energy. Instead, the topic was the experimentation with slipgate tech.

This then means that Doomguy's - or, the Slayer's - actual people already have been saved. He continues to fight on because he is totally psychotic at this point and cannot cease to fight demons. But perhaps he also sympathizes with this Humanity 2 from Hayden's Earth?",6,1585640428,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fs8pea/spoilers_question_about_the_slayers_backstory/,Doom,1

In the other he comes back just when the invasion happened and provides help to fight back.

OK, hold up. what is going on here? Why are these UAC scientists not aware at all about the cultist activities? This invasion has been going on for years. There's propaganda on their own base. The dialogue of these characters hugely contradicts what's written in the flavor text of the codex on the UAC.

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased the game on Steam, and have been loving it so far. However, on my first playthrough I experienced numerous crashes. At first they were frequent, once every 30-45 minutes, but eventually they died down and I was able to play for hours without issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to start up a new save file and try for the 10 lives challenge, but am really struggling. The game is crashing every 10-15 minutes. These crashes are abrupt, and go straight back to desktop. No error code. Very little info in Event Viewer.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried:

\- Updating drivers

\- Adjusting settings/capping frames/capping texture pools

\- No undervolt/overclocking etc

\- No accessories

\- Disabling overlays/not using third party apps like discord

\- RAM diagnostic (I've read that these crashes are caused by memory leaks potentially?)

\- Reinstall/verify game files/numerous restarts/updating BIOS

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to try a fresh windows install for one game; I've also found a few posts from people who have tried this to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

The official help article with these issues only pertains to the Bethesda launcher, so I was hoping maybe one of you had a solution for Steam users.

fs84np,EoceneMiacid,Finished Doom Eternal yesterday. Here's my thoughts.,"I absolutely love this game. I've got 42 hours in so far, and despite having seen nearly everything the game has to offer, I'm not even close to being done with it. It's probably my favorite single player campaign of any FPS game. The trailers suggested it would a bit story heavy but that didn't turn out to be the case at all, and the platforming didn't put me off either. As far as I'm concerned, this is a nearly perfect computer game.

...nearly. One thing that consistently annoyed me in 2016 were the talking holograms and they're even more annoying here. The voice acting is quite bad, the comically cheerful tone clashes badly, and the edgy social commentary doesn't work for me. Doom Eternal is obviously not meant to be taken seriously but the UAC's aggressive promotion of Earth being turned into Hell doesn't even begin to make the slightest amount of sense.

Also, where to go from here? I certainly hope there will be more Doom in the future but I'm having trouble envisioning a new scenario that would merit the Slayer's invention. Perhaps the need to end it once and for all and invade Hell to assassinate the Prince of Darkness himself, Satan?

fs84hc,WheelJack83,Question on King Novik (PLOT SPOILERS),"So...we meet King Novik's Force Ghost on Exultia. He warns Doom Slayer that he can't defy the Khan Makyr and doing so will bring down heaven's wrath. Doom Slayer defies the Khan Makyr, beats her, she's like ""doing this will threaten all of creation.""

And at the end, Novik is just like, ""Good job Slayer. You keep slaying.""

What the hell? Does Novik not care that the Khan Makyr and the priests betrayed him? Did Novik, the Sentinels and Doom Slayer not go to war with them before? What was that Force Ghost conversation all about?

I just don't get why Novik would take that attitude and then suddenly turn it around at the end. Was that some Jedi Mind Trick/reverse-psychology nonsense?",16,1585637424,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fs84hc/question_on_king_novik_plot_spoilers/,Doom,1

.....And then I discovered the Soul Cube (a relic from Doom 3 resurrection of evil) on doom guys desk.  And I realized Doom 3 guy is one of the same with our legendary Slayer.  

That being said I cannot figure out at what point of the timeline he fits???

Now I know doom 3 is kinda like the black sheep of the family, being a half life clone and all, but I still very much enjoy the game, and would love to see more Doom 3 lore in the series.

Initially I assumed it was because there is literally no matchmaking; the game would pit me against the mermaids in Atlantis. But recently I actually tested this with friends in a private match, all from the same country, all 300mb+ upload, and *it still lags like crazy*. The Marauder still freezes mid jump, the flying Meatball still updates movement once every 300 frames etc. I mean half the people can't even join the game(due to Bethesda account bug), the other half has to deal with these servers hosted on a single Raspberry Pi somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic.

The amount of DPS you can put out is insane and playing as demons is overly complicated and you can't deal nearly as much DPS as the Slayer.   


Campaign is more fun to play as the Slayer and playing as a Demon is just frustrating since people have had 3 years to learn how to play as the Slayer and nobody knows how to play the demons yet.   


They need to either nerf the Slayer or buff the hell out of player demons because no matter which side you're playing as it's just not as fun as the singleplayer.

fs63la,RelocationWoes,Why do enemies and marauders consistently despawn/disappear in the middle of a fight?,"I'm actually right at this exact fight in the last level: [https://youtu.be/oXUolQ-lhMM?t=32733](https://youtu.be/oXUolQ-lhMM?t=32733) (not my gameplay) playing on PC.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few waves in this fight. Around the third wave, the Marauder appears. After him, it's the Arch-vile. I'm getting my ass kicked here, so I've fought this battle at both Nightmare and Ultra-Violence about 10 times, easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

In like 5 of these attemots, if I heavily evade the Marauder to gather resources, he'll just literally despawn from the game, and it'll proceed to the final wave with the Arch-vile. Even if I haven't even shot him or hurt him. And it's not from environmental damage or BFGs or anything else unexpected. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I have to do is jump to the second floor and run around a bit looking for low tier enemies... and a few seconds later he'll just be completely gone and I'll be at the next wave. It's insanely frustrating, actually.

&amp;#x200B;

This actually happened a few other times earlier in the game with other baddies. For example, in the previous world (before you fight Khan Maykr) you're bunny hopping between floating islands. One of those battles involved a Titan, and when I fought him, the exact same thing happened. I decided to concentrate on some other guys, killed them, circled the platforms a few times... and suddenly the battle was over, the doors unlocked, and the Titan was totally gone.

&amp;#x200B;

I swear to shit I remember this happening in Doom 2016 too on Xbox.

I was also confused by the UAC narrative.  They’re clearly turned evil and their leadership is corrupted - but guns are firing at the demons, you get into the station with the BFG and people are still fighting so everyone hasn’t drank the coolaid... I would have liked to see some clear references that the UAC underlings were like “Fuck this, those guys are insane.”  Also... I was HUGELY FUCKING let down that the point where he takes the plasma gun... isn’t the part where you get the plasma gun.  I expected that scene much sooner in the game.

Lastly, the beginning of the game.  I don’t know what DLC is planned to fix this but I hope it does good because its still the worst part for me.  You go from 2016 to.... fortress of solitude.  It’s odd.

The heavy cannon micro missle mod will fire a bolt mod bullet (either only 1 every 3 seconds, or at the fire rate of the gun itself) and mastery will always remain unlocked. (Which ruins immersion in my opinion)

The plasma rifle will just have mastery for the heat wave, I'm not sure about the microwave though.

I haven't found a way to fix this. Turning on the IDKFA cheat again (if you have this bug already) and messing with the mods helps, but doesnt fix it.",4,1585623597,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fs54je/psa_do_not_enable_the_idkfa_cheat/,Doom,1

fs53cw,1Winfield,"How Doom Eternal Can Improve, Updates [[Some Spoilers]]","So yeah I love Doom Eternal. It's an 8.5/10 without question if we are focusing on the single-player. This post will probably be medium length and I'm gonna go point by point of what I think it can approve on and why to the best of my ability. No idea how to post to ID messaging boards but here it goes.   


**Multiplayer**  
I do not count multiplayer towards the overall scoring of the game for the most part. As honestly, you could just boot up Doom 2016 multiplayer if you want to get a good experience. Which some people will get pissed off at because you have to go back to an older game. But that's why I'm guessing the multiplayer is just the battlemode because then people would complain they just copy-pasted over Doom 2016 multiplayer and force people to regrind all their old points or something like that. Maybe ID could have it if they patch in the multiplayer later on that you could just link your account and if you had unlocked stuff from 2016, you would get stuff in this one.  


But I personally think it would be weird if they just ported the same type of multiplayer from 2016 into this game. Which is why I think they didn't. Either that or they had to focus purely on single player.  


What they can improve on is add new modes (duh I know). But stuff like ARC vs Demons where you can play as those cool mechs vs the demons of hell. I think that would still keep the theme of Battlemode in it, as well as give people the option for more classic multiplayer modes. But slayer vs slayers I think they should keep out. That's just me though.  


**Combat**  
It's got better movement, better weapon variety, better mods, better enemies, better arenas, and better glory kills. But then they lack behind 2016 in the one thing Doom players love more than almost all of those put together. Power.  


Let me explain.  


2016, you kick serious demon ass with a president amount of just pure sheer firepower. You have bigger guns, bigger muscles, and they have bigger guts for you to rip and tear out. You beat them by dodging their attacks and pumping them full of enough lead to cancel out the radiation coming from Chernobyl. There wasn't much else to that combat other than just keep hitting them till they fall over.  


Doom Eternal goes just a smidge too far in the other direction. In 2016 you could just keep holding down the trigger and kill most things fairly easily. In Eternal you got to deal with about three times the movement options with dashing and monkey bars, nearly double the types of enemies, two types of grenades, and 2 new superweapons of The Crusible and the Unmyaker. Not to mention weak points on enemies and some enemies making it so you have to change your fighting style midfight.  


It's 10x the amount of stuff needed to be tracked and you can no longer just keep plowing through as you used to. Now I like this idea as you have to actually be engaged beyond just holding down the trigger like 2016. But you lose that feeling of being a force of nature by a good amount. Your chainsaw no longer feels as good as 2016 because you can only use it on small enemies without it being a waste, your ammo is pathetic even when comparing the E3 trailer for Doom Eternal you have only 60% the ammo that gameplay showed at endgame. So again your chainsaw feels weak and you can't get too into the feel of a gun before running out of ammo and being forced to switch. To me that makes me feel like I'm being frantic rather than being the thing causing the panic.  


These issues, however, are easily fixed in a few ways. One is to obviously increase ammo count or have it so lower difficulty gives you more ammo compared to higher ones rather. Make it so you can upgrade the chainsaw to be able to recharge more slots. Finally, when you use the crusible blade it should also act like a chainsaw kill as that acts as your level 5 chainsaw did back in 2016.  


TL;DR, fix how ammo is scaled with difficulty or increase the overall account, make it so you can upgrade the chainsaw, have your Crusible Blade drop ammo and health like a chainsaw. This to me would increase the feeling of being a force of nature.",13,1585623456,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fs53cw/how_doom_eternal_can_improve_updates_some_spoilers/,Doom,1

fs4zms,Dr_EpicSquidness,DOOT Skin Begging,"Hello! I want to preface this with two facts: one, if this is the wrong place to put this kinda stuff please notify me and I will gladly take it down or whatever needs to be done, I just looked through the rules and such and didn't see anything prohibit this sorta post so I'm assuming it's allowed, and two, I am aware that I did this thing entirely to myself, and don't expect to actually see it go the way I'd hope it will, and I totally understand why and accept that fact. So, here is the context in short(ish) form: I am surrounded by unending DOOM: Eternal hype and having never tried the series, consider heavily buying it. I then go to the Steam page and see the pre-order bonus DOOT Revenant skin. After a few more days, I decided that the refund policy is such that I can pre-order this, and if it sucks, I can just return it, but that skin alone made the purchase worth it. So, launch day comes along and I play the first level...suffice to say I'm rusty and bad at shooters in general, and it's initial difficulty didn't leave a great first impression on me. Due to my limited funds and own over-thinking, I did the (in hindsight) dumbest option and decided to refund it to buy Half-Life Alyx instead. A few days later, I still see the hype and love everything about the game, asked others who confirmed that it was likely just my inability to realize the learning curve initially and realized how stupid I was to return it and decide to take the financial hit and re-buy it. Suffice to say, I love the game now and I am now an avid fan. Still, the fact that I lost that beautiful DOOT Revenant skin eats at me. I don't feel nearly as strongly about the loss of DOOM: 64 or the other bonuses, but that skin, I just respect the devs so much for giving credence to a meme, and I'm irked to no end that I essentially shot myself in the foot with my own poor decision making. So here I am, in a last-ditch effort to quell my unending regret and begging in all the places possible (Discord, the Forums, and now, here) for some sort of miracle from the great Id/Bethesda gods to have mercy upon me and reunite me with my lost, golden trumpet treasure. Alas, I suspect that the answer will be a ""No"", and as I said before, I totally respect and understand that but I cannot help but get on my knees and beg you for that skin.

fs4ozy,Gloriouspieps,Doom Eternal's early game,"Like I said before I think this game is great overall, but certainly not without flaw either. I recently started trying to get a UN run but my motivation just dwindles in absolutely no time due to the very, very slow gradual increase of pace. It's also really annoying the game throws the Arachnatron at your face repeatedly, which deal insane damage on UN may I add, without allowing you to dash and without allowing you to use any of the weapons that you get drip fed throughout the first missions. The result is needing to constantly take cover, then fire at their weak spot. The pace is horrible and it feels bad.

Recently got a friend into the game and it just pained me to see how incredibly slow the game feels in the first two levels. This is suppose to be the *introduction to the game*. Why do we get 2 weapon mods but *no dash*? I also don't understand why we get essential combo weapons from level 5 onwards(Balista in this case). I like the idea of progression, but it just feels so damn slow in this game and ruins the otherwise excellent pace.",8,1585621825,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fs4ozy/doom_eternals_early_game/,Doom,1

His fight is Eternal and yadayada so they could always make more doom games, and they are obviously going to be supporting Eternal for the foreseeable future with Free content( Events, master levels etc) and campaign expansions. BUT....

Did anyone else get really big Quake 1 vibes from all the gothic/fantasy architecture of the sentinel worlds?? I think ID could pull off a really good remake of Quake 1 and merge the two universes together. Plus, that way ID get a game to focus on proper death match with, since that’s what Quake is known for.

Story Premise could be that it’s set a fair amount of time after Eternal. Humanity is slowly rebuilding the Earth but resources are extremely scarce due to all the Destruction and Demonic corruption. The ARC or whatever it becomes afterwards starts sending Military explorers and Marine through reverse engineered sentinel slips gates to explore other worlds for resources and colonisation. Things go well for a while until stumbling upon Shub-Niggurath and her monsters out in the far reaches. BOOM Quake 1 Starts.

This significantly lowers the Slayer's overall and burst(!) damage.  Anyone else think that it seems reasonable to consider lowering demon health on console a bit to compensate for the loss of this extremely important ability to the slayer? The only thing demons lose in the transfer from pc to console is aim accuracy which the slayer is equally affected by.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing Doom Eternal since launch and I've started experiencing some problems, mainly crashes. I managed to get through half of the game until Half-Life Alyx released with its Nvidia Drivers, which I promptly installed. Turns out, it created black flickering bars in Doom Eternal that led to crashes. I rolled back to a previous driver and, while the flickering black bars were gone, the game itself keeps crashing after roughly 10 minutes of gameplay.  


I've tried different graphic settings, switched to borderless window, reinstalled and the crashes still persist.

Anyone else experiencing the same issues?

fs3kag,Jake_AA,In defense of the Marauder,When I first started playing DOOM Eternal the Marauder boss was the first major roadblock between me and fun. Some 40 hours later and I think the Marauder (while yes needing some tweaking) is an excellent addition to the DOOM enemy roster. I think he offers an incredibly unique challenge that is seen nowhere else in the game. Towards the end of the game when he became an uncommon enemy I found myself excited that he was going to be the next big piece of a combat puzzle I was going to solve and master. I played my first play through on ultra-violence and now that I play mainly on nightmare I can say without a doubt that his slower more methodical style of play perfectly compliments the ripping and tearing through countless demons. Weapon switching is the name of the game with him. Bait an attack and then punish with the ballista and quickly swap to the super shotty for maximum damage. Hitting him twice within one stagger is the easiest and most fun way of taking him down. I’m sure many will disagree but once you master weapon switching he is an incredibly fun and engaging fight.,18,1585617478,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fs3kag/in_defense_of_the_marauder/,Doom,1

But Samur uses subterfuge in order to find roundabout ways of defying the Khan. Hiding the Father, and giving the Slayer ""strength and speed to match his will"", and eventually escaping to earth.

fs2ah4,MulhollandMaster121,Eternal is to DOOM 2016 what Aliens was to Alien,"Cliche metaphor but it’s true. Doom 16 was a paired down game, devoid of the complex plots and stories of modern games, stripped of anything unnecessary that could get in the way of the amazing combat. (Alien was a paired down movie where everything was in service of the terror that slowly built up on the Nostromo)

Eternal immediately starts more conventionally for a game- the subtitles tell you who’s saying the initial line of dialogue, there’s a mini opening credit sequence and of course it’s in 3rd person. 

While the combat is bigger and more bombastic (and more gamey), there’s an attempt at explaining the larger mythos and delivering fan service (DG/DS), much like how Aliens dialed up the action but at the expense of more conventional story tropes and set pieces (Newt and the romance with Hicks, anyone)

So, overall I’m feeling that Doom Eternal is an absolute blast - it’s crazier, bigger, faster and more aggressive than its predecessor, but it’s definitely more conventional and has more crap that can get in the way of its solid foundation, which is amazing combat.

fs1zoo,MO1STNUGG3T,A few small tips for nightmare on consoles,"So the equipment swapping and flame belch can kinda mess up your pace and momentum when used because of the layout of the buttons. 

Using flame belch requires you to press either “triangle” on ps4 or “Y” on Xbox, which briefly takes your thumb off the right joystick, stopping you from aiming properly. What I did was configure the flame belch to “L3” that way all I had to do was click the left joystick to activate, and also keep up my pace. Keep in mind the

The equipment switch button, or left on the D-pad is also another iffy placement for a function as is requires you to take your thumb off the left stick, which makes you briefly unable to move. Although it doesn’t completely negate the problem, I find that swapping the equipment switch button(left on the d-pad) and the mission info button(down on the d-pad) can help with maintaining your movement as you don’t have to take as much time switching equipment.

And apparently you should completely turn off “look smoothing” as it can apparently affect gameplay",6,1585611666,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fs1zoo/a_few_small_tips_for_nightmare_on_consoles/,Doom,1

fs18gr,Wreckbot7,Jumpscares in Doom Eternal?,"So I've been playing Doom Eternal for the past couple days and my slow progression has gotten me through the first two missions so far and I've been having a lot of fun. The only thing I've found to personally dislike as a whole is, because of my own patheticness, the Tentacles. I've never had affinity for jumpscares in anything, and pretty much just things suddenly happening in general, so having a Tentacle pop out at me for the first time gave me a serious jump. I can pretty much deal with the ones in the holes since at least I can deal with them, and I predicted the ones in the purple ooze because it looked like a perfect spot to place them so at least I knew they were coming. This also got me thinking about genuine jumpscares throughout the game. I know that Doom isn't a horror focused game (aside from Doom 3) , you pretty much are the horror, and all the ""scary"" elements are likely just an enemy ambush which I can deal with, but also knowing that id has placed a jumpscare in Doom 2016 has gotten my subconscious hyper-paranoid about any in Doom Eternal. Basically, my brain hates jumpscares and is forcing me to ask about any occurring in Doom Eternal lol. This is mainly referring to scripted jumpscares such as the zombie in Doom 2016 that are intended to be jumpscares, and not something more along the lines of an enemy barging out of nowhere to attack you. Feel free to laugh at this post as I know that this is a pretty weak thing to ask and I have no doubt it's going to happen.",9,1585608895,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fs18gr/jumpscares_in_doom_eternal/,Doom,1

fs0cij,chryseusAquila,I now believe it would have been better if doomguy and the betrayer were the same character.,"In Markipliers lets play of DOOM Eternal - part 6 he just got past the lore dump that is Sentinel Prime when he had very interesting things to say about the story of doomguy, beginning at 44:48  
(I don't want to post the link to not upset Rule 6)

To shorten it down, he essentially says that it would have been a better motivation for doomguy to have lost his son instead of just being a killcrazy guy yelling rip and tear.

I think Marks angle on the DOOM Lore is actually really good. When I initially got to this part I thought it was the coolest that the Slayer is og doomguy. A man who battled demons throughout what I assume to be DOOM 1, 2 and 64, went insane and lost himself in the madness of war against an enemy made of pure terror. That Story has a simplicity to it that is very befitting of DOOM. 

But I must admit, if they would have given doomguy the storyline of the betrayer that would be cooler. Joke is, they could have easily done both. They make a point of it that doomguy was still human when he arrived on Argent D'nur. He could have easily taken a wife and had a son after he rose through the ranks and it would have been easy to explain that a warrior culture like the sentinels would give one with such combat prowess like doomguy the rights to marry and so on.

fs08ig,The_Real_Nero3000,"No Snapmap, No Thank You.","I know what you're probably thinking. ""This guy is really not going to buy the game all because it doesn't have snapmap?""

Well, yeah.

But let me explain because I am a huge fan of Doom, and I loved the campaign in the first game but after beating the game multiple times over on the most punishing of difficulties I became bored of the same old slaying everyday. Running through the same halls, slaying the same demons, and even challenging arcade mode to get the highest scores among my friends.

But to me I value longevity, and new experiences in a video game. Especially one that is priced at $60 and to me without the ability to enjoy this game in the same way that I did the majority of Doom being Snapmap, I just can't put my money down just yet. Maybe if it ever goes on sale but that's likely not for a while.

But what it all boiled down to after we all had grown tired of the campaign was Snapmap and the traditional Quake style multiplayer content.

Before I go any further just know that I understand the reasoning behind removing Snapmap, and in no way am I critiquing their current work on Doom Eternal. The game is an absolute masterpiece.

Anyway, it all came down to Snapmap. I can't even tell you how many hours we spent creating our own maps, from extremely difficult cooperative experiences to silly arcade games with mechanics that were not in the original campaign or multiplayer.

Snapmap gave us the drive to keep coming back to Doom. Even now, in 2020 my friends and I are still playing Snapmap, finding new ways to enjoy the sandbox and I think I can speak for that percentage of people who miss this feature as much as I do.

So if any of the Devs are listening, keep up the great work, but also keep all of us Snapmappers in mind, we are still here, and still have hope.",4,1585605553,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fs08ig/no_snapmap_no_thank_you/,Doom,1

How about you go play Portal or The Talos Principle if you love platforming so much? As far as I'm concerned, every stupid fucking puzzle is just more time being taken away from shooting (which if you didn't know, is kinda the point of Doom).

I didn't mind the platforming in D2016 or the Wolfenstein games that much, because they felt like shooters with brief platforming elements to break from the monotony of combat. This game feels like Portal, except you're holding a gun and occasionally have to shoot things. Also, Portal actually had well-designed platforming. To sum up, a little platforming to spice things up is fine. But some crazy puzzle after every single fight is excessive to say the least.

I hate that I can't enjoy this game as much as everyone else because I was hoping that Doom of all games would be a shooter and not some puzzle game (and again, I'm able to clear them.

frzxts,DaedalCeiling,My Proposed Doom Timeline,"Alright, after reading all of the Doom Eternal codex entries and seeing the official confirmation of the Slayer’s backstory I think I may know the timeline.

I am sure there are some plot points I am missing, so please let me know.

- The 2100s, Potential Future of our Earth today.

As we all know, the stories of the three original Doom games, Doom I, Doom II, and Doom 64 are incredibly basic.

So, as it goes, Doomguy assaults his commanding officer due to an order to fire on civilians, and gets subsequently sent to Mars, to work with the UAC. Then, the teleportation technology goes haywire, and then we play the game.

Then, after killing both the Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind, Doomguy returns to Earth and fights the Demons there, thus commencing Doom II. 

As for Doom 64, I don’t know the exact plot, as my pre order bonuses were botched, but I do know that Doomguy returned to Hell to seal the new portal from the inside.

After thousands of years I presume, Doomguy is pulled from the Hell dimension.

This point of the timeline is crucial, since it connects the two games.

- Eons in the Past, Argent D’Nur (The First Age)

By traveling through dimensions, not only does Doomguy travel to the past, but he also resets the timeline, in an alternate path. 

Then, as informed on Doom Eternal, the Doom Marine is seen outside the castle walls of Sentinel Prime, and then is taken in as an Outlander, to fight in the Arena for glory.

Over time, he proves himself as a capable fighter, which pays off as the invasion of Demons commences. 

Then, at the Battle of Taras Nabad, Samur Maykr, takes him to the Divinity Machine, and blesses him with terrible speed and strength unprecedented to any living creature.

Then, the betrayal of the Deag takes place, and the now-dubbed Slayer and his team of Sentinels are trapped in Hell because of the closure of the portal.

Now, for Eons, the Slayer kills Demons and Titans alike, with nothing but his bare hands.

We know that, eventually, the Wretch creates the Praetor Suit in the Forges of Hell, and adorns the Slayer with it.

Time keeps progressing with this unbridled rage against the Demons, until Deag Grav traps him in the Blood Temple, entombing him in the Sarcophagus.

- 2100s, Hell, Alternate, New Timeline

Samuel Hayden and his team of UAC personnel find the Sarcophagus in their expedition, and arrange for its removal from Hell.

The Slayer is awakened, presumably by King Novik during the Mars invasion, and then goes on the kill the Cyberdemon, Hell Guards, and Spidet Mastermind again.

After this, the timeline is obscured, as there is a time jump between Doom and Doom Eternal.

All we know is that the Slayer was presumably put in a sort of purgatory, and then came to inherit the Fortress of Doom.

Then Doom Eternal happens, the Icon of Sin is killed, and the invasion of Earth is postponed.

frzv3o,BigThiccc,A quick rant on the marauder.,"I'm replaying the campaign and once again I find myself stuck at the end of arc complex. For some reason this marauder and the one at the beginning of sentinel prime kick my ass no matter what. I just now realized that it has nothing to do with the marauders themselves, but everything to do with their locations.

In the ARC complex, you're in a small cramped room with very little verticality and 4 small columns of cover.

In sentinel prime, you're on a long path with a set of stairs. Some verticality, no cover.

These two spaces' design are completely antithetical to the rest of the game. The only new feature you can use in this area is the dash, which kind of helps. But there's nothing else. For the rest of the game, even when there are marauders, there's something else for you. Monkey bars, jump pads, structures you can easily weave in and out of, etc. 

So I think the problem here is that Id fumbled the ball a bit. It's not like there aren't other similar areas, but putting a marauder in the room with you really highlights it.",8,1585604361,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frzv3o/a_quick_rant_on_the_marauder/,Doom,1

frzsex,RikenVorkovin,Theory on game lore going forward about characters/story. (Spoilers abound!),"Alright,

so I have been really pondering the lore lately. And I just am going over some thoughts in my head I wanted to get out on paper here about what I think may happen going forward for us.

First off, Samuel Hayden.

We pretty much know now that Samuel Hayden is the Seraphim that gave Doom Guy his powers making him the Slayer. The phrasing is basically exactly the same ""This will give you strength, help you on your journey"". Haydens robotic shell has similar architecture to the Slayer Castle, meaning its possibly/most likely internally Maykr designed. 

So, I don't think we know Haydens ultimate goals yet. He seems opposed to Hell, and helped the Slayer get his powers, but for what motive? If you take Samuel Haydens name and take the first and last part of each word, you get Sayden, or Satan. In some forms of Lucifaranism, Satan is not ultimately evil, but a misunderstood Angel who gave humanity a fighting chance. He's basically Prometheus giving fire to humanity and being punished by God for it. 

Samuel kind of is following this path. He stole the essence of the Father from Urdak and left, helping to uplift humanity with the founding of the UAC and the use of Argent Energy. He is now on the Castle which is being powered by hell energy with the Crucible. Will this ultimately corrupt Hayden? Make him a ultimate evil Satan in the end of the third game we must take down? 

VEGA - We now know VEGA is essentially the essence of God in AI form. Its what makes VEGA such a potent powerhouse of a AI to begin with. VEGA is now plugged back into Urdak, so I have hopes it will get back to ""normal"" and become a ally to the Slayer to ultimately take down Hell in the third game. 

Speaking about the third game -

I think we are going to be fulltime going to Hell, and fighting/taking down the Dark Lords of Hell whoever they are. And then I think Hayden will become corrupt and become the ultimate antagonist in the end. I think his motives were noble to begin with, but I think he will become corrupted by the hell energy he is stuck being fed right now in the castle. 

Anyway, these are my thoughts, I love discussing this stuff! Please let me know what you think about all of this.",0,1585604124,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frzsex/theory_on_game_lore_going_forward_about/,Doom,1

* Where Doom Guy was sent to at the end of Doom 2016
* How Hayden got super messed up between the two games
* How Doom Guy got the Fortress of Doom
* What *was* the UAC shooting the BFG 10k at? (And how we make sure it stays deader than dead.)
* More flashbacks to Doom Guy's battle with the titan we see in Taras Nabad
* Seeing all those sweet giant mechs in action
* Something continuing right after the ending of Doom Eternal
* A Doom Eternal take on the [*Plutonia Experiment*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77A2_sgRAoo)

frzies,EvanP3rks,Cultist Base and Mars Core Bugs,"Hello!

I'm finishing up my run through of Doom Eternal and noticed I'm not the only one experiencing the demonic corruption meter bug on Cultist Base and Mars Core. I went back on Cultist since it was the first arena and I got the weapon point but in my save slot it still shows red as if I I didn't complete it. As for Mars Core, it was the last arena so I have to basically redo the entire mission hoping it doesn't bug out again. 

My issue is, being a completion-ist does re-doing the map and it saying you completed the arena then take away that red marker? And if not, does the game not treat it as a 100%? Even when I enter the mission itself it says all is completed but in my save slot it still shows red.  Thanks in advance!

Haven't seen too much discussion on it around here &amp; was just wondering what peoples thoughts were?

I've played a few matches as the slayer &amp; as demons (marauder mostly) and I cant actually tell if I like it or not. It seems to be either an absolute stomping by the demons or the slayer, no in-between in the time i've played. I enjoy how hectic it is and it does feel quite satisfying when you kill another player controlled character. The demon abilities are ok when you get used to them but I find it a little fiddly switching between the summon I want - i'm playing on Xbox One.

My main issue so far is the matchmaking balancing. Saw a few games where it would put a level 2/3 slayer against demons of level 20/30/40+. Seems like it should be limited to people within a certain range.

frxkow,FatFanMan,Is it just me or is Doom Eternal worse than Doom (2016),"I feel that Doom eternal is way worse than Doom 2016. The game is great and all but Its just not as fun to me as other games. The games is way more linear than doom 2016 or doom 1, 2, and 64 in its level design, where it's just fight in an arena look for secrets in that arena, then platforming or puzzle then arena. Doom 2016 is like this to an extent but there was just a lot more areas to explore and it wasn't as restrictive whereas in doom eternal you go foward and you cant backtrack it's just the same level design over and over. There are no traps, interesting level design with huge amounts exploration no infighting and the combat has you running away from demons instead of running towards unlike every other doom game except for 3. I just wish Doom eternal had the level design of doom 2 like map 15 industrial zone with demons that are waiting behind trap doors or ambushes or interesting lighting in doom 64 where it's pitch black and slowly lights up and there's a shit ton of demons. I hoped that the level design would fuck with you, but instead it's just platforming or puzzle then arena fighting rinse and repeat.

Another gripe I have with Doom eternal is the combat its not as fun as doom 2016 way too much screen shake, way slower movement speed than any other doom game except for 3. It feels like I'm walking and I can understand if  this is compensation for the dash, monkey bars and meat hook but it's just too slow I'd rather have way faster movement speed than a dash. Then the combat loop is pretty annoying as well because its kill demons, run out of ammo, chainsaw run around shoot run out of ammo run away waiting for chainsaw to refill chainsaw repeat, there's just way too low of an ammo pool and I know the low ammo is too encourage using your entire arsenal but it's annoying trying use the right weapon for the right demon but I can't because of the low ammo pool so I have to use a weapon that's not good for fighting that particular demon or waste a chainsaw ammunition and then run away. Another problem with the game is the super shotgun is shit for damage and usefulness it used to be great in Doom 2016 but I've seen other playthroughs of doom eternal and it's not used as much in let's plays I've noticed I dont use the super shotgun as much either. The only reason it's used is because of the meat hook  of you took the meat hook away nobody would use the super shotgun because its reload is slower and the damage is lower. Another grip is you always runaway you are never as aggressive  in doom 2016. Everybody plays much more conservative and defensive in this game because the enemies are more aggressive, spongy, and there is a million of them in one combat arena. Arena either have to be spongy but there are fewer of them or have shit ton of demons but many of them have tiny health pools.

TL;DR Doom eternal is good game but worse than doom 2016 because of linear level design, not enough ammo or chainsaw fuel, slower movement speed(not talking about the enhanced mobility just the walking speed), spongy enemies, super shotgun not good damage and  slow reload speed, combat forcing you to run away and play defensively sometimes.",8,1585597018,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frxkow/is_it_just_me_or_is_doom_eternal_worse_than_doom/,Doom,1

frx0z3,Sp00kyD0gg0,Zoomin and Doomin: High-Intensity Doom Lore,"A few days ago, I made a promise. Some nimrods brought up lore, and I, like a thirsty man falling right into the tinder trap set by a 40 year old overweight catfish, took the bait. So it’s time to set down your controller or keyboard for just a moment. Matter of fact, why were you holding your keyboard? What, do you play like that? Like some kind of *freak*? I’ve got my eye on you freak boy... anyways. Today, we’re gonna do some schooling.


You may ask yourself “Oh Spooky Doggo, this is a game about high speed and chopping demons apart like a Gordon Ramsey special: why do you want to talk about the lore, like a lame nerd.” The answer is simple, hypothetical voice in my head: I’m a nerd. A massive loser NERD. You don’t have to look at my post history; you don’t have to ask any of my *incredibly* disappointed ex girlfriends; I’m telling you up front. I am nerd: I see game, I see story, I read, I learn, I perfect. I turned the 12 hour campaign of Doom Eternal into a 24 hour *EXPERIENCE* because I read EVERY. GOD. DAMN. CODEX. ENTRY. TWICE.


So there’s your intro: we’re doing Doom lore. Because Doom has a story now! And spoiler alert: it’s a really good one. I’ll be doing these lore summaries in a number of bite-sized posts, because there’s just too much to handle at once, and while I could shove it all in your face, you likely wouldn’t be able to handle the size. And other phrases I will never be able to truthfully say in a sexual context.


We’ll skip the Makyr and the Slayer for today, because I think the basis of the new Doom world should be covered first, and that is undoubtedly the Sentinels: or rather, the Argenta.


Oh, and heads up, this will be long. Shorter than the actual lore, but still. Long.


#DOOM LORE PART ONE: SENTINELS


The Argenta are a race of humanoid people that inhabit the most metal planet in the multiverse. Their planet of Argent D’Nur is like a 4 year-old’s birthday party: fucking EVERYTHING is trying to kill you, and if you let your guard down, you will be executed with extreme fucking prejudice.


Long before the Argenta had really evolved passed the neanderthallic stages of cave drawings and tier-3 subs to pokimane, their planet was behaving as most planets do: just chilling in space. Now, I know this is hard because I am a text-based entity to you, but let’s get some interaction here. I want you to guess what happens to the planet next. Just. Just guess.


If you guessed *IMPALED BY A FUCKING SPEAR OF LITERAL COSMIC PROPORTIONS*, then congrats! You were right. Contact me via PM for your Reddit Gold. There’s nothing more valuable in this economy. The value only goes up.


This was the Cosmic Spear, a massive space continent that literally pierced the planet from pole to pole and also served as a seriously basic-ass spaceship for an alien species known as the Wraith. Like really guys: no jets, no thrusters, nothing? You just fucking *yeeted* yourselves into space and hoped for the best? Probably used a catapult too, rather than the SUPERIOR trebuchet haha funny Reddit meme. You may remember the Wraiths from their cameo in Doom 2016, when we stabbed them in the chest. I... I know we did a lot of stabbing and killing in that game but... I promise it was distinct. These Wraith have a sort of passive effect on the world around them the Argenta call the “Wraithsong.” This is not to be confused with the “Wraithsong” from the Apex Legends universe, which is when a Wraith player with a TTV in their name flies in solo, immediately dies, and leaves the game, all within 3 minutes. A niche joke I know but come on I’m trying to pander to as many audiences as I can here.


The Wraithsong behaves similar to a Buff Totem, but on a global scale: everything on the planet became stronger, more resilient, and more hostile. Maybe they glow red, too, I don’t fuckin know. And most importantly, evolution began to accelerate, particularly for the Argenta. The Argenta suddenly become aware of their weakness in the midst of this harsh world. My personal thought is that the “Objective: Survive” HUD icon from Halo: Reach collectively popped into their heads, but I can’t prove it. What I CAN prove is that they have the most metal origin story phrase of all time:


&gt; “Thus, we came to be; born of rock and fire, lowly in birth but risen by the strength of our will. By the blessedness of the First Ones (Wraiths), we forged sword and shield and took hammer to the Ancestrals. We claimed dominion of creation by right of blood and magick, and the Time of Man came to be.”


Like holy fuck, guys. Thank god there’s only one or two passages in the world that read this badass, because my blood pressure can only go so high. Main takeaways from this particular passage is their rapid advancement from the Stone Age to the Metal Age, which they reference as The Secret of the Sword. A pretty Disney-ish sounding title all things considered, but what can you do, not everything can be The Most Badass Thing (tm), plus my heart can only take so much.


Another thing to note is the Ancestrals. These were MASSSSIVE fucking beasts that first awakened to the Wraithsong and absolutely kicked the shit out of each other for years until the Argenta found the secret sword sauce and fucked em up. Argenta culture undertook a sort of Viking focus on murder, death, hunting, etc., because in a world where everything is insanely fucking powerful and huge and you’re a teeeeeny tiny human, that’s kind of what you do.


Here’s a fun side note: in every dimension, it looks like early development of life had giant alien species. For Earth, it was the Adaggon Hunter, which would be resurrected as the Doom Hunter. Hell has Titans. And Argent D’Nur had Ancestrals, along with a number of other unsavory creatures who arose due to the Wraithsong (like the Gargoyle, who was not giant, but a massive bitch worthy of mention nonetheless).


So the Argenta evolve rapidly, and soon mark their dominance of the world, nearly hunting the goliaths that roam their lands to extinction, and forming complex warrior political systems, including the Night Sentinels, which acted as political and specialty soldiers in these early days, and also is apparently spelled Night rather than Knight, which I found out *after* drafting this whole post, fuck me. A King was nominated, King Ormero the Father, and *apparently* his bloodline will continually “reign in perpetuity.” Which seems to conflict with their “the strongest is king” ideals? Whatever, they’re space Vikings: not exactly expecting Plato out of them. Also rising in power was the Order of the Deag, who at first worshipped the Wraiths rather than the Makyr’s, those team-killing fucktards.


And for a while, the Argenta do pretty good. There’s not “*peace*,” per say, because there’s apparently constant barbarian hordes that need to be fended off, and also apparently the Wraithsong drives people fucking insane sometimes? Which should really be written on the side of the bottle under side effects, but what are you gonna do, the Argenta don’t have American medical laws. Which is probably why they lasted so long, honestly... Aside from all this, though, the planet was kinda chillin. Then one day they get a knock at their door, and who is on the other side. Oh holy fuck it’s GOD!


The Makyr arrive on Argent D’Nur, heralding a new age for the Argenta.... and the beginning of the end.


I’m not going to delve toooooo deep into Makyr lore here: that’s for another day. But let’s leave it at this: you know how much of an absolute bitch the Khan Makyr is? Well turns out she wasn’t always like that. In fact, all the Makyr used to be pretty chill. When they came to Argent D’Nur, they weren’t like “It is your peoples’ time to give sacrifice, you defy the will of the Khan Makyr, we will resurrect the Icon of Sin, blahhh blahhh blahhh.” No, the Argenta get the way better version of events, as the Makyr show up and pull a Bernie Sanders, just GIVING OUT free stuff.


The Argenta are blessed with Makyr technology, which they integrate into their Metal-age technology. This is why, thematically, Sentinel gear functions like futuristic bullshit, but looks like King Arthur’s loincloth; this is literally the fusion of technology and dark-age combat. The Makyr also granted their dead passage into Urdak, which meant that the brutal hellscape of life the Argenta were so used to was eased with the assurance of an afterlife with their family. The Argenta officially abandoned their worship of the metal as fuck Wraiths (but kept suckin power from the Wraithsong, greedy little bastards) and officially converted to the pansy warm embrace of the Makyrs.


The influence, gifts, and blessings of the Makyr combine with the Wraithsong to make the Argenta truly powerful. So powerful they get tired of their planet, and decide to go conqueror other worlds and dimensions, to spread the good word of their Makyr overlords. If this sounds sketchy to you, well... it isn’t. It actually all goes well, somehow. Every world the Argenta touch is gifted with their technology, and introduced to the Makyr religion, which *at the time* was pretty baller. Argenta extends its reach across dimensions, establishing its cities and settlements all over the multiverse, like a metaphorical inter-dimensional cumshot.


At this time the Khan Makyr approaches the current King and says, “Heeeeeeyyy, not to freak you out or anything, but... you know that sweet Heaven deal we’ve got going on?”

And the King says, “Oh yes, the Heaven deal, the only thing keeping a warlike race such as us with galactic and dimensional control from being bloodthirsty cannibals and instead making us pretty chill missionaries with swords?”

“Yeah that one. Well, DON’T freak out, but like... I totally just had a vision that one guy would come along and fuck it up. But like, do *nooooot* stress my man, like don’t even worry. We’ve got a machine to test for this Dark One when he shows up. But like, someone like that probably won’t show up for a loooooong time.”


And then someone shows up and fucks it up. And that’s the Slayer. Oops.


The Slayer’s arrival tipped the Makyr off to Hell, something they became interested in after certain political struggles (which we *WILL NOT TALK ABOUT HERE IN SPITE OF HOW MUCH I WANT TO*) led to a change in their outlook on life. What happens next can only be described as a complete breakdown from inside the Argenta’s own political and religious systems. Which is not a topic relevant to current real-world events *in the slightest*.


First: the Unholy Wars. The hordes of demons nearly break the Argenta, until the Deag and the Makyr discover Hell energy, and it’s subsequent Meth-Lab synthesis into Argent Energy (combining Hell Energy with Wraith Energy, if you didn’t know already you *illiterate fu*—). This totally turns the tide, and suddenly not only are the Night Sentinels kicking ass, but the people of Argent are flourishing with the new energy supply. Death is all but a forgotten concept, machines and weapons soared in development and effectiveness, devil worship ran abundant, new dimensions were in reach... if this sounds shady to you, well... this time it is. It most definitely is.


While the *people* of Argent D’Nur certainly took on a lot of that sweet sweet Argent, the Night Sentinels were pretty suspicious, and held back. This would lead to the eventual conflict causing their betrayal.


Then comes the siege of Taras Nabad. You’ll remember this city because it has a fucking Marauder RIGHT AT THE GODDAMN START, fucking masochists at id. Things are shitty: Hell launches a surprise attack with a goddamn Titan named the Dreadnought, which no one knows how they snuck in so sneakily (laughs in Deag Priests betrayal, wrinkly bastards). The Titan is basically invincible, and the City all but falls. Except an angel named Samur(el Hayden *cough cough*) takes the Slayer and puts him in that machine the Khan Makyr made to detect the Dark one, and it *for some reason gives him superpowers*. Literally none of the Argenta know why or how. So we just run with it. He makes quick work of the Titan, and becomes a godlike figure amongst the Night Sentinels, somewhat ironically, seeing as how his victory arose from the blasphemy of Samur(el Icon Priest on Earth) going against the Khan Makyr’s orders in empowering the Slayer.

Let’s get blasphemous. Say you’re a Christian. A really good Christian. You’ve spread the word of God to just about everyone you meet. And one day, mid-communion, Jesus Christ himself kick flips into the chapel, skulls a Smirnoff Ice, and proceeds to finger bang a hooker. You’d probably be like, “Jesus, this is DIRECTLY AGAINST everything you stand for!” And Jesus would say “Welp, this is what I stand for now! Thanks for all the advertising! Also that Spooky Doggo guy: totally going to heaven!” Wow. Thanks metaphorical Jesus. That means a lot.


This is pretty much exactly what happens to the Argenta. The Makyr secretly set up a Hell-Energy Mob-Spawner-and-Farm with the Redstone know-how of the Deag Priests. These are the Soul Spires, one of which we climb after liberating two docile Titan bois in Nekravol Pt. II. The steady flow of Argent Energy made at these spires resolves the Makyr’s crisis (but I’m not gonna tell you what it iiiiiiis), and the people of Argent get even more power and like limitless electricity.


While this is happening, the Night Sentinels are all off fighting Hell’s forces as they attempt to invade. So they don’t see the subtle change in their own population. Because, spoilers, Argent Energy is FROM HELL and it CORRUPTS THE SHIT OUT OF YOU. You know how each of the Hell Priests looks like Emperor Palpatine’s nutsack? Yeah, that’s happening to like *everyone*. At the very least they’re all becoming evil and hedonistic. I bet the women even wear short skirts and clothing that reveals the shoulders. Absolutely fucking SCANDALOUS.

The Night Sentinels stumble upon one of the Soul Spires deep into a Hell expedition, realize that their gods have made a mockery of them, and also use their dead AS FUEL FOR BOTH THEM AND THEIR TECHNOLOGY. Because oh yeah, did I mention that Hell energy is the SOUL SIPHONED OFF OF A BEING KILLED BY HELL’S FORCES AND TORTURED FOR A SIMULATED MILLENNIA. Cuz that’s a thing. And if you were wondering, yes, before the Makyr, Hell absolutely tortured souls to get this energy. But once the Makyr came around, they really revolutionized the industry. Amplified the process. Mechanized it. True capitalist heroes.


The Night Sentinels try to tell everyone that their gods are actually making torture machines for their enemies, but *oopsies!*, those multiple worlds you indoctrinated into your religion are waaaaay too deep into that religion now and won’t listen to you now! Turns out that whole deal WAS sketchy as fuck! What we get is a civil war amongst the Argenta, but instead of SpiderMan, we got the fucking Marauder out of this one. God damn it, Marvel really does get all the good deals. The blessings of the Makyr make these evil Sentinels immortal, but every time they fall in battle, the Hell Energy used to revive them corrupts them further. Also, every other non-Sentinel is pretty much on the Makyr side too. It would seem pretty one sided against the good guy Sentinels, but... they have Doomguy. So pretty even odds.


This all ends with “the trap,” and no you weaboo sicko, it’s not a chick with a dick. The Deag Priests, who still *pretended* to worship the Wraiths for the Sentinels but *actually* worshipped the Makyr, opened a portal to the Nekravol Soul Spire for the Sentinels. But the portal is fucky, and sends the Sentinels scattered all over Hell, where they were stranded and ripped apart. Simultaneously, the Betrayer was mind-controlled/blackmailed into revealing critical info about the Wraiths, which allowed them to be consumed by Hell *just* to serve as a cool set piece in the final mission of 2016. Fucking insensitive of Hell right there.


This whole trap is an assfucking worthy of a Tarantino movie. By the end, the Night Sentinels are pretty fucking far from okay.


And that was the end of the Sentinels! Only the Slayer survived, and while he may have had a legitimate claim to the role of Sentinel back in the day (roles determined by the strongest warrior, presumably by who could hit one of those arcade punch-strength test thingies the hardest), he’s an Earthling, and forever the “outsider” of the Sentinels. The Betrayer lives, but in exile, and he don’t count as an OG anymore. Friendship ended with the Betrayer: now Slayer is my best friend.


This leaves the rest of Argenta, and what do you know: they’ve completely fallen from grace. The Makyr’s new religion basically worships Hell, so what has resulted is a civilization with all of the glorious knightly tradition found in early Sentinel lore with none of the chivalry or honor. They are total puppets the the Makyr and complacent as Hell consumes the universe, rather than the main opposing force that they used to be. This is a Cosby-level fall from grace. Is... is it too soon to make that joke?


I suppose before we wrap this up I can talk quickly on the Argenta cities we come across in the campaign, and what their purposes were/are. Exultia is *hypothetically* the capital city of the Sentinel Empire, used only for the most noble of exposition cutscenes. We can assume this due to King Novic’s throne being here. However, the lore tab here is just more whining about being betrayed by the Deag. I’m all for lore man, but... could you take it somewhere else? Sentinel Prime is the “holy city” of the Argenta, “holy” not for any religious reason but because it housed the sacred art of Beating the Shit Out of Each Other in the Arena. That’s... not even a joke. Taras Nabad was a very wealthy city of nobles, known for the arts and exuberant architecture. The first to go in the Hell invasion: these Red demons stayed true to their commie pallet by taking out the richest first, smh my head. Then there’s Hebeth on Mars, a relic from Sentinel expansion into the Earth dimension/system. This was a “port” city, serving as the portal nexus for many of the Sentinel’s more distant worlds. It was also the marker of the Sentinel’s dominance over the Bethian clans that used to inhabit the outer worlds. It’s sort of like if we named New York City “Redskin Central” after we brutally ripped the land out from beneath the Native Americans.

So! To recap: some lads were born on the most metal planet in existence, grew powerful due to the constant screaming of some very tentacley boys, found Jesus, pillaged multiple universes with wholesomeness, watched as the deific beings who had given them everything succumbed to the temptations of an inferior underworld, and are now either dead, living a life of SIN (I mean jeez, women can probably VOTE in Argenta society now. What are we, HEATHENS?), or the single worst enemy type in the fucking game GOD DAMN IT I HATE MARAUDERS.",12,1585595351,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frx0z3/zoomin_and_doomin_highintensity_doom_lore/,Doom,1

frx0qi,St1rner,Will Doomguy Face the Dark Lord?,"It feels like destiny that at some point, that Doomguy is gonna have to go against the Dark Lord, the master of puppets himself. The ending cut scene of the Khan Mayker fight seems to say that we have pushed forth a series of events that we will inevitably have to face. However, King Novik stated that if we continued down our path, we would, ""incure the wrath of the heavens"" which to me foreshadows not the Icon of Sin's return or even the battle with the Khan Maykr but instead fighting the ruling heads of Urdak.

I guess my big question is, if Vega is indeed the Father and Samuel is Samur, then that means that Doomguy truly is the right hand of god in a sense and he's destined to destroy the Dark Lord at some point in the future.

frwu9x,BroccoliThunder,"Suggestion: Detailed statistics for your playthrough, Mode with randomized demons","Greetings

I know Doom is all about obliterating demons, so would like to suggest to add a log where all combat data is stored, for the player to look at. Amout of deaths, weapon usage, accuracy, time spent etc.

2nd suggestion is some kind of marathon mode which is activated after your playthrough, thus is played with a fully decked slayer. Maps are chosen at random and enemy spawns are randomized, so every playthrough is a surprise. For instance you stitch 10 maps or mapsections together and the player has to fight through, sections are sperated by portals after the fights are completed. In the end you are presented with a scoreboard.

Thanks for reading

frwrwy,mustachiopotato,Issues with collision detection,"I’m not sure if this is just me, but is anyone else having issues with Doom Eternal’s collision detection? At least for me, it seems like it’s easy to get glued to an enemy, side of a wall, or a lip off the ground and then subsequently die from being stuck and surrounded without a chance to escape.

I’ve beaten the game on ultra violent and have had quite a few times where I’ve died due to being stuck on a wall or enemy, but now I’m on nightmare and it’s practically crucial that you do not make one wrong move or stand in one place, so getting stuck essentially means death. I don’t remember this being an issue in Doom 2016. Back then the environment felt slick, and it felt like you would slide off the walls if you find yourself cornered in one. In Doom Eternal it’s as I almost Velcro myself to everything.

I’m having trouble finding links to send my concerns. Is there anywhere I could go? Is anyone else having the same issue as myself?

frwhxy,LightwaveAlice,In defense of the purple goo,"They're as much of a hazard as lava or nukage, but instead of taking damage from the goo itself, it leaves you more open to attack. It's a unique take on the floor hazard and it's about as avoidable as the others, just stay off it. I know you kinda have to tread through it at first, but really thats just to teach the player as to how this new hazard works. After the first encounter it's pretty easy to avoid it buy double jumping and dashing over it. When it appears in arenas in levels, the SSG's meat hook gives you a way to quickly get out of it in case you happen to fall into it. Just grapple onto any demon and use it to fling yourself out of it.

I really don't get why people complain about it. Yeah it slows you down but thats the point! It's a *hazard!* You wouldn't just casually walk through lava, would you? Of course not, you would try to avoid falling into it as much as possible. It's really not that hard to figure out. 

Personally I think it's a welcome edition to the lineup of environmental hazards. While it's similar to other floor hazards, it's different enough to mix up the gameplay and keep things interesting. That first purple goo area in the ARC Complex level is honestly one of my favorite arenas in the game. It makes you focus more on staying in the air more than most other arenas and it's a lot of fun!",10,1585593714,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frwhxy/in_defense_of_the_purple_goo/,Doom,1

Does anyone feel like the bosses becoming just normal enemies really takes away from that part of the game?
I understand the marauders, even though I would’ve rather had them occasionally appear as a 1v1 throughout the game after they get introduced, that one kinda makes sense
What doesn’t make sense, is the doom hunter
For me the doom hunter is one of the most badass parts in the game, and for me, that level was the moment when it went from good to great
So why have him show up as a normal enemy? I feel like it takes away from me wanting to go back and play the level again, and the whole idea was that they were built in that area to kill you

1. Get every Milestone so that it shows on the top 80/81
2. Delete all Savefiles (i know that hurts especially if you delete the ultranightmare one)
3. make sure if you go to Milestones again it shows something about 59/81 in total, it will remove some Campaign Milestones like the master lvl for every weapon one (It removes all Milestones with get/make xxx in a single save slot) The same things happens if you just restart the game and the first thing you do is go to Milestones, it wont show whem all.

Is there anything I can do at this point, or am I permanently locked out of the unicorn skin? I opened a support ticket, but there's been no response yet (which is understandable given the current situation everyone is in).

frs2zm,getquickscopedxD,Thoughts about game and Ending (SPOILERS),"After killing Icon of Sin, King Novik speaks for a bit, a cleansed Earth is shown, and that's it. Credits roll. Absolutely no input from VEGA, no input from Haydn. No one says anything and nothing is shown. They could've atleast given Haydn something to say? Dunno, ending feels blank to me. It's a very grand ending, but there is nothing after it. I would've loved if Haydn or VEGA would've said something. Like, you've just killed the Khan Maykr and the Icon of Sin, two very grand and powerful, important figures in the game, but after it there is nothing said or done. Just the globe without demons, and King Noviks phrase. Felt empty and without emotion.

Then, also, why couldn't I kill the Icon of Sin? Why does this game feel like it needs to do everything for me? Why couldn't I press the button? Why couldn't I stab him with the Crucible blade? Also, why couldn't I shoot the BFG and the two turrets? Why?

I just don't understand why. All these nuisances may seem insignificant, but in the end they do take away from the overall greatness and feel of the game. I would've loved to ACTUALLY blow a hole into Mars. Also, why am I locked in place in elevators? I'm so confused as to why these unnecessary features were even introduced.

Don't get me wrong. I love this game. But seeing these simple things that have been done wrong upsets me, because they may seem insignificant, but they make the game, they polish it, they make it feel special.

Sorry for ranting. Just really upset at some of the choices made here.

frr8k0,Phantom569,Theory: The masterplan of seraphim,"So at this point, if you've read all the lore and paid attention to the ingame dialogue, it's pretty obvious that Samuel Hayden is the same ""entity"" as Samur Makyr aka the seraphim. They have the same VA, similar voice lines and even more terrible giveaways. When you enter the ritual for icon of sin, the makyr base greets you as the seraphim. But you're clearly not, no it's hayden inside your system who's being detected as the seraphim. VEGA, at this point, has been abandoned. Also talking about VEGA, seraphim stole the Father from the makyrs and put him into VEGA, which is why VEGA asks ""am I the father"" near the end. Also, maybe the reason hayden is rabbling so much about leaving makyr sooner than later and using the excuse ""the longer the icon of sin is on earth, the stronger it grows"", is because VEGA or the Father is already in the makyr world. The mysterious voice in the end which screams ""nooo"" is also probably the father.

With all that said, why? Everything after doom 64, after doomguy met up with the sentinels and the makyrs, seems like the masterplan of the seraphim. EVERYTHING after the reboot (doom 2016). The makyrs wouldn't have gone evil if seraphim didn't steal the father from them. Everything would've been fine. But it seems like the seraphim completely helped to bring about this ""prophecy"". Hayden says ""Two titans meet - as it was written"", when you fight the icon of sin. But why would he do all this? What's the gain? And what's the point of doing the things hayden did in doom 2016, the UAC, solving the energy crisis, were those just a hoax to bring about this prophecy? Ofcourse, even in the divinity machine's lore entry, it was written that a destroyer would come, to destroy heaven. So everything seems to point to the seraphim as someone who makes the prophecies true. But there's gotta be a personal reason.

I've a pretty crazy theory, isn't satan a fallen angel? who wanted to overthrow god. Isn't it too convenient that the seraphim brought about the destruction of heaven, leaving only hell standing and also the old theory about how ""Samuel Hayden"" sounds like Satan?

I'm really damn confused and overwhelmed by all this lore. Would love to hear other's thoughts",7,1585576574,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frr8k0/theory_the_masterplan_of_seraphim/,Doom,1

frqboa,rowrowthegreat,2016 vs Eternal,"Doom 2016 was a far better game in my personal opinion, here's why:

\-The dark theme in Doom 2016 was more apt for the subject matter, and the darker environments felt like they belonged the way they were. The new theme in Eternal favors a brighter pallet. It clearly draws inspiration from the original Doom titles. Pinkies specifically are VERY pink.

\-The graphics are comparable between the two, with the noted exception of the enemy models. Good lord were the new models amazing. There is nothing even remotely comparable in 2016 to this. I was incredulous from the moment I started shooting at how well fleshed out their damage models were. THERE IS NO JANK WHATSOEVER. Absolutely brilliant, gorgeous, detailed enemies with superbly emulated emotions. All the Character Models that I have run across have been the highlight of the Eternal experience for me. My only complaint is that the monsters and even the environments seem a little too cartoonish, at times, for my liking. It just comes back to their colour scheme and personal preference. Both of the platforms make extensive use of the Vulkan graphics .api which is just a fantastic back-end for stuff like this. The load times in both titles when running Vulkan is lightning quick and I still have a standard hard disk. After death because Vulkan caches most assets on initial load it is even faster, my counter is often already at 90% by the time it renders. If anybody is running this on a different .api you are nuts.

\-The audio basically went unchanged. Just lots of heavy metal over the sound of wholesale demon murder. Not noticing any notable disparities between the two experiences. One audio note. Doomguy talks at the beginning of Eternal, but only in a expositionary capacity during a flash back. A poor narrative choice, in my opinion,  considering he said nothing of importance.

\-Level design is a big standout difference. In eternal we see a move away from the claustrophobic UAC facilities on Mars in exchange for our own personal space station complete with teleporter. Eternal's levels are  without a doubt on a different scale entirely from Doom 2016, but not in the way that you'd think. The levels are mostly the same size in terms of total area, but as soon as we look at height and spread it is very apparent how vast these levels are. There is a lot more verticality and sprawl in Eternal's maps. Doom 2016 still has my favourite levels. My favorite secret is the plasma gun in the maintenance shaft. One whole level early? Yes please! The new problem with the sprawl and the level design for eternal is I'm getting FAR less initial secrets that in Doom 2016. Its not that they are hidden better, I just refuse to go out of my way for something I don't care about. I did find Doom 2016 to be a little more polished in terms of environment and lighting, and even secret hiding. The combat arenas for large enemy fights were designed better for the mechanics as compared to Eternal. In Eternal you can bet I'll just be making circles around my enemies from the sky. Seriously the dashes allow you to literally break combat in the game, so OP.  I can't say that I particularly enjoy the new platforming style. It feels silly. The mechanics work well enough, but it strains credulity when I bail into the abyss 5 times and don't die. I've seen a lot of games following this trend so clearly some people do like this mechanic. I personally think it has no place in Doom.

\-We've seen a redesign of some weapons in Eternal. Most notably the model for the plasma gun was changed to more closely resemble the pixelated grey-brown tube that was the original. It literally performs the same as the 2016 version though. Stylistically this fits their retro vibe of classic doom. They also added a grapple to the Super Shotgun, changed the spin up Chain gun to EM and gave siege mode an extra tri-barrel , the combat shotgun eschews burst firing for full auto, the Unmayker (it was in N64 instead of BFG) , the balista replaces the gauss cannon, and the Crucible; the ultimate melee weapon. The weapon mods were changed for some existing weapons but mostly the loadout functions the same. The melee damage is non-existent. On ultra-violence I can 2-punch zombies in 2016. I have not been able to count the number required in Eternity but it is more than 5... on Hurt me Plenty. Also no pistol, boo. It makes me sad as they took out upgrades for the Super Shotgun, and the end perk is that the hook sets people on fire. The double shot mastery of this gun in 2016 made it THE gun to use on all mid to large enemies. The weird new melee attack that is charged by glory kills is interesting; I didn't use it much. There is no weapon that can function without ammo except your melee attack, which uncharged is like hitting a demon with a limp noodle.

Support items is where my major issues with this doom iteration lie. The flame gout is a cool idea I guess, but it is ultimately not effective against anything. It is a method by which to generate armor. I think armor should have been relegated to dropping from opponents proportional to the amount of armor their outfit has. However, if you kill em while they're on fire you get like 20-30 shards for just an unarmed zombie so guess who never runs out of armor ever now? ME. The shoulder mounted grenade launcher is equally pointless. Doomguy could probably throw a grenade further since he's literally a GOD. The dash system at present is totally op and you can basically fly around any arena you're in. The chainsaw sees increased use, but due to my least enjoyed change. Everything runs out of ammo after killing one or two large enemies until you get some of those ammo upgrades. Now I have a KB+M setup for this game so the number keys are great for picking out weapons, It would be a nightmare if I had only the weapon wheel. The dev's reasoning was this way we will be forced to strategize our ammo usage. They could have just put less pickups around. Specifically one thing I noticed they no longer have ammo crates which were probably contributing to the over-stocked arsenals they cited from Doom 2016 for this ""innovative solution"". My complaint about BOTH 2016 and Eternal is that most enemies no longer drop ammo. There were far less pickups in the original Dooms because you could stock ammo off the enemies you were fighting. This also ensured that ammo would be used strategically (kill grunts with pistols or Chain gun, shotgun guys with shotguns, Chain gun Soldiers with Chain gun etc...) as your accuracy would determine your overall conservation. But I digress: The health system rewarding you for glory kills is a good mechanic, and I suppose dropping both health AND ammo would not be balanced. This way it also ensures that you aren't spending 20 minutes backtracking for all the delicious corpse goo.

\- The lore in Eternal is moderately fleshed out and very continuous with the rebooted series and the original. The thing I really liked about Eternal was that the lore was clearly written with the existing lore. Most of the Doom Eternal Lore is featured in documents scattered around the game, much like 2016. There is no clear winner both games have roughly the same amount of cinematic cut scenes, although Eternal has the edge, I believe, for number of collectables. The cast delivered their scripts well in both titles. Each one had roughly 1 hour of cutscenes that only really told about a quarter of the story. The rest is in hidden lore items, or foreshadowing events. I love a game that doesn't jam everything down your throat all at once or even at all. I still don't know what's going on in Sword Art Online for the Switch because I skip every single cutscene. I don't need some neck-beard to butcher a Japanese translation into angsty poetry and Awkward social interactions - both of which are void of anything remotely resembling human speech patterns -  for me to enjoy stabbing monsters in the face. Doom gets that; except for its weird younger brother Doom 3 which I enjoyed in a different manner. I couldn't go back now though, that's what Dead Space and Prey are for.

\- From a technical design aspect Doom Eternal is the superior specimen. It runs well, the enemies look and die great. They added some new enemies to shake it up. The weapon changes were mostly meaningful and well received. New movement abilities and support powers need balancing, but I'm entirely sure they were totally unnecessary as a whole. Doom 2 for instance did not change any major mechanics. Instead they opted to focus on level design, enemy design, a few new weapons, a few new power ups and they kept everything else basically the same. The content was the levels. People already loved the mechanics. All these new mechanics haven't really added all that much. In fact I barely used flame gout at all. Super punch I only use accidentally when I'm attempting a glory kill. Dashes make feel like I'm in creator mode as I fly around in the stratosphere rocket-sniping demons. Also I don't run places. I jump-dash to them. I have no clue what the multiplayer is like and never will. Why would you play Doom for multiplayer?

\- Doom 2016 is my favourite arcade shooter of all time. It had so many things right, and so little that could go wrong. It recaptured that original shooter feel before the industry got the idea for out-of-combat health regeneration. They made all the right nods in all the right places. The doom classic levels were cool to have as collectables as well but they were a little janky in terms of enemy behaviour, or so I heard. Snap-maps ensured that there was a good community database for new user-created content, although admittedly I didn't really dive into it much. The game was simple, played a consistent 60 fps across all platforms effortlessly, and gave us the long awaited sequel to Final Doom. Who could ask for more?

\-For SOME reason \*cough\* ZeniMax \*cough\* Bethesda \*cough\* Doom 2016 even came out with an update for terribly balanced and totally out of touch multiplayer platform overhaul 1 year and one month after release. It added 60 GB of game files and exactly 0 new players. I have a gigabit line so no sweat on me, but you couldn't start singleplayer without downloading it. This definitely caused some grief for some players. Luckily it could be fixed with some creative file editing to change steam's download tag status. All the development money that went into that was a huge waste as the servers were a ghost town a month later. Certain parties who will remain nameless have a history of design-by-committee. Without any understanding that the product itself is actually an art form and not a simple commodity, they latch on to popular industry ideas in an attempt to appeal to more customers. The problem is that video game genres aren't like movie genres. Some things just don't belong in certain places. Doom 2016 could've gotten by easily with a basic online with 3 functions. A deathmatch, co-op mode with snapmap support, and a pre-designed co-op campaign. These grubby fingerprints can be seen all over some design choices for Doom 2016 and Eternal both. Specifically I believe the major mechanics changes were pushed for from up the ladder. The studios in question have a really bad reputation for making extremely bad choices where their customers are concerned and then telling their customers they wanted it.

\-All in all Doom 2016 is mechanically far superior to Eternal in my opinion, adding on the fact that the theme of the game overall fit the tone of the original dooms more than Eternal although Eternal's colour scheme is much closer to Doom 1993 than Doom 2016 is. I know Eternal is better graphically and I must add again that I am particularly very impressed with their damage models for the enemies BUT by making unnecessary changes to the core mechanics of the game when the original was received so well, certain management members are openly displaying their ignorance of what their customers truly want. You know what would be a great plan either way? Migrating the damage assets back to DOOM 2016. Both are programmed in the same environment, assets were probably already re-used in Eternal. It would be actually great for them to just patch new damage models into 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I think that about does it,

TL:DR

I like Doom 2016 better than Eternal because it is mechanically superior in my opinion. Bethesda and ZeniMax are stupid and also suck. ID is OK though.",10,1585573107,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frqboa/2016_vs_eternal/,Doom,1

frpwpg,Inn_Unknown,How about a discussion on the wild hot takes!!!,"So, DOOM Eternal finally drops and as far as I'm concerned its an amazing follow up to 2016 that took what 2016 brought to the table and just built upon it. I won't sit here and say its perfect as no game is and even I can see a few flaws in it of course. 

I suppose my biggest gripes could be that maybe in some of the Secret Gore Nest challenges there isn't always a zombie to ammo up on, but TBH I really only had that problem once. Sometimes I feel I get a lil too sidetracked explaoring and looking for the hidden stuff, but that is more of a personal issue. 

There was a couple weird bugs, like in the Mars mission at the final encounter, something didn't trigger and the music stopped and monsters oddly weren't attack me and in one case in the Gladiator fight he just wouldn't take damage anymore. I had one game crash (I am playing on the PS4 since I need a new Video Card for my PC currently).

Thing is I am just confused at the wild hot takes that have been used for making negative reviews, where I just ask, Did we play the same game?

Things I hear is the gripes about platforming, 2016 had platforming in it, hell the entire Argent Tower level was a platforming level. The yelling about low ammo caps, when the game explains right away that you use the chainsaw to ammo up and it always refills, plus there is always a zombie somewhere respawing to ensure you have ammo. The upset over the difficulty, what so they shouldn't be challenging you now? One reviewer I watched actually made the comment that they shouldn't have to be forced to use all the weapons and their equipment to make it through a fight, WTF?

The Marauder, holy hell the upsets over this one enemy, at first I was a lil in agreement over thinking this dude was a lil too over balanced and lil hard to fight, until I figured him out. I started out using the Sticky Bombs for splash damage, which works well, then I started to just focus on fighting him as he was intended and found this guy isn't that bad at all. Hell the one Gore Nest fight where you gotta beat im in 20 seconds is extremely doable...

You don't have to be ""Just Frame"" (where you literally have to react exactly at the exact frame a move is done to beat it out, sorry I come form the FGC), you can actually hit him several times and its just the eyes glow and you have a window that I swear is days long to react to it. Again this is my FGC roots coming out, but your looking at at least 40+frames to react, when I would say you can fire in at least 10 frames (don't quote me on this I'm just judging based of my FG experiecne). The Super Shotgun rekts this dude and the Balista is even better. I don't even feel like he breaks the combat flow either, perhaps you may need to take out the other larger a-holes in the encouter and mop him up last.Then again isn't that a thing DOOM has always been about, prioritizing your enemies to kill in a room first. 

Brings me to the next point the complaints about the enemies thrown at you, something DOOM is known for since its early days even. Throwing a butt ton of enemies at you to fight and you have to prioritize which ones to take out first to better clear the room. DOOM has always been about this, in the early days your focus was eliminating the hitscanners, then you would focus on the smaller things that wittle at you, or deal with an Arch-Vile first. This game is no different. 

I can agree on maybe there is way too many cut scenes this time around and unlike 2016, the story tends to get in the way of the action a lil more and yes I can fully see why folks hate the underwater section of Tarras Nabad. 

TLDR: I just don't get many of these complaints from these reviewers, many of them sound more like odd nitpicks to try and be original and not give it a glowing reveiw. I tried looking at these things in an objective way and not be blinded for being a DOOM fan. I just can't understand how though, the game spells things out to you frequently. Its very upfront on how it wants you to play it. It just feels like these folks just did not try to understand the game at all.

frpooo,TohavDuudhe,"2016 VS Eternal, a note from a 3 decade fan","So after rippin and tearin my way through Eternal, (UV then a lot of cheat playing around, then Nightmare) something I've noticed. 

There is a difference I noticed between these two games that, I can't get over, and it bums me out. And that difference comes the feeling of presence. In 2016 I felt as Doom Guy, there in that world. Every thing felt so solid and connected and believable. Now I understand that nobody buys doom for believability but here me out.

Eternal has all the rippin and tearing a guy could ask for.  There are tweaks to combat and tactics to mix up the feel and that's fine. It's still fun. Still hard. Still bloody af. But there's an appreciation for immersion and connectivity to a game world that I'm sure some people can relate with, that Doom Eternal feels like it just left behind, for really no reason.

Consider the following:
-Prying open doors
-Grabbing weapons from corpses
-Finding your chainsaw inside a torso and tearing it out, using his foot to pin the corpse down to do so
-Every switch gets hit
-Destroying the Argent Filters
-Every key item gets picked up and physically used by the Slayer (looking at you upper half of Dr. Peters)
-Every key card snatched off a lanyard
-Key skulls grabbed and used
-Large fall heights had a kneel landing that felt solid and cool
-player death animations felt great and like I actually got what was coming to me
-Final Boss Glory Kill
-enemies performing glory kiills on the player
-wall based glory kills
-well hidden secrets that felt naturally tucked away
-Berserk and Chainsaw having a variety of kills per demon
-Using the Crucible
-Saving Vega
-Collecting Praetor
-Getting absolutely steam rolled by a pinky and watching my arms flail as I rolled 30 feat dead af

There's more if I played through again I'm sure but I think this demonstrates my point.

All of these well designed and immersive bits of flair, while not completely absent, were largely traded for two less immersive, and waaay less satisfying things

Punchy push blocks (really thought we left push blocks behind years ago)
Punchy wall cracks

That, combined with the glowy floaty nature of everything (what the actual fuck 10 foot tall Blood Punch fist) just took, so so much away from this game. I understand changes happen between sequels and that's fine. The game play in Eternal is strong and that's important. But the world presence feels, just awful. Between the glowy floaty everything and the lack of world interaction, just doesn't feel as satisfying or immersive to be present in that world. 

Some people will say I'm being nit picky and that's fine. Not everyone seeks atmosphere and immersion. But a lot of people do, and Eternal just didn't deliver on a lot of that, and there's really no good reason why they couldn't have.",17,1585570438,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frpooo/2016_vs_eternal_a_note_from_a_3_decade_fan/,Doom,1

froyxh,discordfurryabuse,Doom Eternal's tone and Doomguy Characterization,"Aight so this is probably gonna be ignored or downvoted. But did anyone else feel that Eternal tried way way waaay too hard to make Doomguy cool? Like he wasnt already, i think 2016 while a bit cartoonish struck the balance well, where he wasnt over the top, a bit angry and the lore shit was like aight i guess since you could ignore it but in Eternal this whole narrative they did was not only confusing and generic but makes Doom guy feel like a forced gary stu character. In the originals he was just a dude, sure he did something cool by defying orders once and the rabbit thing was a bit silly but other than that in the games it never felt like he was an invincible (my man literally dies on epsiode 1 ) ubermench. Hell he didnt even feel particularly angry or vindictive, felt like it was a fight for survival not a vendetta, his role was getting to the exit and stopping the invasion, not genociding as a maniac. He was so understated as being unique or special that you could find other marines that looked just like him on spikes or dead on the floor, and that was dope,i liked that.   


I get the memes and stuff back then were fun but now it feels as if his character IS the rip and tear meme, wich sucks because to me it comes off as edgy and lacking self awareness, the whole point of the comic was that it was funny and cheesy / edgy and i always laughed at and with it rather than took it seriously. And now they made him speak and he's saying shit like talking about guts. 

I just wish they kept him simpler and more human, ironically hes less cool to me now, because theres so much shit sorrounding him and like its so much about him now that its less interesting than when it felt like he just happened to be the one dude to survive. Like a 80's action hero instead of what it feels now like a chosen one kinda deal.

Even the character design is so much worse, look at the originals, hes wearing standard armor, its not overly technological or bulky, and hes not this beefy hunk, hes built , because hes a marine but hes not Atlas, and the new one, with the hand saw and the weird thing on the shoulder and pouches on the back where i dont even know how he can reach there with all the bulky armor?? And way too much detailing, and the weird mid rift thing wich i think is reference to the box art mid rift from the originals?? but that was battle damage not an actual part of the design of the uniform.

This whole thing translates into the atmosphere too, instead of isolation and archaicness it feels too over the top and bright sometimes on the levels, without going into level design wich is definately a downgrade from originals and 2016 with way too much focus on platforming and just really confusing choices on some levels + lack of cohesion between stages thanks to the flaky plot. Originally doom was gonna be an Aliens game right? Wich makes sense, with the protagonist and levels giving off a feeling of dread and humane struggle. And its just missing wich might just be a personal gripe i guess, but i dont see the point in changing it, even if its just different and not worse? why make another videogame where how cool the hero is , is constantly shoved in your face. Plus having him talk in that one cutscene was a big mistake, my dude is like gordon freeman, not a words person besides the grunts.",3,1585567251,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/froyxh/doom_eternals_tone_and_doomguy_characterization/,Doom,1

Staying behind the eyes in Doom 2016 was one of the best creative decisions and one of the most memorable aspects of the game. And I cannot fathom why Id chose to abandon this for less impactful, run of the mill, Master Chief style storytelling mechanics.

Not once during the campaign did I see any aspect of the cutscenes that benefited more from not being behind the Slayer's eyes. Cutting away to see a different angle of the resulting death and destruction I just caused? How is that at all most satisfying that witnessing it literally first hand?

I would like to hear of one single out of body cutscene that I and a lot of DOOM FPS couldn't instantly improve with some quick first person versions. And yes, punch ins still count as FPS, Doom Guy has great vision after all.

Not to mention it would have cost countless more hours in directing and animation to provide the myriad of outer body shots. (I know this as fact, I work in the animation/games industry)

And for those about to suggest that the cutscene contents would have been hard/impossible to show in a first person view, showing the Kahn Makyr in full view etc, can absolutely sit down, the first person moments in Eternal held so much punchy weighty impact, (the beheading of the first Hell Priest for example).

The problem with the BFG 10 000 is that it's too big for doomguy to handle. I thought I just needed to forget about it and did so until today.

Mechs. We have giant mechs, with giant hands that can hold the giant BFG.

&amp;#x200B;

I would imagine it as similar to the Revenant control part : Doomguy takes control of a mech and battles with it against giant demons. Around 2/3 of the gameplay he would go to the BFG base and manage to basically steal the giant gun.

He would use it similarly to the 9 000 version, except the ennemies would be bigger.

frna8a,Monkey_With_Tankard,I have the tiniest complaints about Battlemode.,"Why are Skins buggy? I'll equip a skin, just to have it not show until next game, except the Inferno Lord skin for Marauder, it just doesn't show at all, the symbol above his head only.   
Minions in Battlemode for Demon players should be able to be shot through. We're in a tight map, with a bunch of mindless AI demons, blocking all our shots against the Slayer. They can block the Slayers shots too, but his attacks actually do something.   
And again Tiny complaints, and this is probably just me, but why is the Matchmaking so harsh on me? I'll play Demon, I go up against Slayers who play Ultra Nightmare in their sleep, and my teammate is someone who only knows Trigger goes Boom. Whenever I play Slayer, I get Demons who are much higher level than me, why don't I get those guys as teammates as Demon, and Slayers and Demons my level, yes, I need to get good to do good, but I can't get good against people who are already good and demolish me, making it impossible for me to learn anything other than run. Simular Level Teammates and Enemy makes it easier to learn and get better, not fight the best of the best and die and learn nothing from the experience.

Everything is just incredibly unbalanced and boring af. If your the slayer it’s like you literally have to sweat bullets in order to kill the other demons. And some of the demons themselves are incredibly overpowered and don’t belong in a mode like this (Archvile/Marauder). That combo is cancerous btw. 

They should’ve just canned this mode altogether and just stuck to single player and dlc. Or maybe brought back the death match from 2016. I love Doom Eternal but battlemode should’ve never happened.

I do have some small complaints about the game, I call them small because its opinion. And ur welcome to share yours and agree or disagree. All welcome here! Let's begin

*** Warning! Potential spoilers ***

1. I was really hoping to see Dr. Betruger come back. Bummed about that one

2. I'm happy that they brought back some of the classic look on some of the demons. But some of the demons still have the Doom 3 syndrome of not looking like demons. Hell Knight for instance, looks like an alien! Why cant he look like his classic look? And some of the demons still look too cartoony to me. And why fuck up the Baron of Hell D2016 model?

3. Too much platforming. Way too much platforming.

4. Kinda wish we got to fight a couple more Titans. God of war 3 style. I would have also liked to make the hell priests actual bosses too.

5. No Dark Lord reveal?

6. I think the Lost Souls (at least the ones tossed from the Pain Elemental) are buggy as hell. Like they literally get stuck and dont move or do anything. Intentional????

7. Would like more mp options like TDM and KoTH

8. Modding/snap map not coming back?

9. No big send off/ glory kill with IoS? Lol

At the end of 2016, Sam Hayden takes the Crucible and teleports the Slayer somewhere. Where? 

Furthermore, at the end of 2016 you are being teleported somewhere where you will not be able to ruin any plans, but at the beginning of Eternal there is no mention of where you were sent to, what did you do there, how did you get back and why now that you are suddenly back, do you have your own Watchtower I? I mean I do not need a 10 minute explanation, but at least /some/ explanation would be nice. 

Ok so you backed up VEGA, plugged him into your very own Galatan and can now drop from orbit like a proper Ultramarine and purge the xenos. Oh and you are also the Predator now.  And maybe BJ Blazkowitz Sr II. 

2016 had very little lore and basically was all about demons bad, you good, go kill. In Eternal I have the feeling that there is a lot of lore and also not nearly enough at the same time.

Even on Hurt Me Plenty I'm having lots of trouble, dying like 15 times in every stage of a mission, simply getting me extremely frustrated and after finishing one praying the next isn't as bad. I tried messing around with the controls, but I have no idea what would be best for me. Could anyone point me in the right direction or give me a template to follow? And one more thing, since I've already checked that Eternal has no m/kb support, I was hoping there's some way Bethesda and id would change their minds. I'm not willing to spend like 150 more dollars on a fancy adaptor just to play one game better(talking about the XIM), so is there anything I could do?

I've found one of the better farming areas is the very early part of the Cultist Base after you break through the wall and there are a bunch of enemies there. Used it to master the Super Shotgun and Micro-Missiles on the Heavy Cannon. 

Honestly, I'm finding the game a lot harder than DOOM 2016, so just finding these spots when I can is helpful. 

Thankfully they kept the part from the first game where your weapon grind saves automatically no matter where you are and never resets.

frl755,BSODden,Sat down for a bit of Doom Eternal before bed. I absolutely hate DisplayPort. (Rant),"So I have a 4 monitor setup: one is a 55"" TV mounted on the wall in front of me as I sit at my computer desk. Then directly at the desk with me are 3 monitors, 2 are 4K and there is one 1080p screen as well.

The TV and the 1080p screen are both connected via HDMI and the other 2 4K monitors via DisplayPort.

I am so angry right now.

Since starting to play Doom Eternal, which I'm enjoying a lot, it has been an absolute nightmare of fighting with these monitors and this is far from the first time/game. The other day I actually was going to play some Doom 2016 again in prep for this game coming out, and there was white static all over the screen when I had it at 4K resolution. Wonderful.

Well, with Doom Eternal, I've mostly been playing on the TV - with an XBox controller. XBox One Elite controller - I like to do it up right and enjoy the experience.

Problem is, part of that is ""okay I've got the game on the big TV, now let me get the room otherwise dark and turn off these other monitors"" - but when I do that, the system absolutely loses its mind. It starts jacking around trying to decide where to send Doom Eternal. By that, I mean, which TURNED OFF MONITOR to reassign it to. So then I have to start turning them back on to figure out where it got sent to, then fight to get it back onto the TV.

I was having decent luck turning everything but the TV off beforehand, setting it to ""primary monitor"" and then starting Doom from a shortcut on that screen area I put there. That was kind of working pretty well most of the time.

Tonight it was giving me such headaches I said, know what? I'll play it on the monitor directly in front of me. Might be cool to see the game up close and personal right here anyway. Well, that was okay for about 20 min... and then the game went flickering, black, and had been sent to another monitor. One that was turned off. Then, I fought and fought to get it to behave again, and when I got it back onto the 4K monitor in front of me, it claimed to be at 3840 x 2160 resolution but looked more like dogshit x pigshit resolution. All attempts to reset it failed.

I got angry enough to take a break and come rant here. I had a limited window of time to play before bed, and this shit is enough to make me wish I'd gotten the game on XBox One X or PS4 Pro instead. I'm glad I got Resident Evil 3 on XBox One X... or I would be glad, if my X hadn't shat the bed about a week ago and stopped putting out HDMI signal! It's in a repair shop now, so we'll see - a repair shop that won't give me any damned updates on what's going on with it, actually.

Sound like the PS4 Pro is off the hook? Oh hell no. If anything, I've had the most headaches with it, and this is primarily because of the PSVR and passthrough HDMI box.

The design of how some of these technologies work, and how they react to a screen being turned off, etc. is just absolutely fucking stupid.",5,1585547221,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frl755/sat_down_for_a_bit_of_doom_eternal_before_bed_i/,Doom,1

frksb1,RS133,How to Fix Doom Eternal,"I feel like this has probably been posted elsewhere, but I haven't been able to find it on reddit so here goes.  You can use the dev console to double the ammo (you can also increase the ammo drop rate).  You can also increase melee damage (though that has some glitches and you'll have to turn it off to smash walls/interactables).  Finally, you can use noclip to fly past the what-were-they-thinking sections, erm, I mean platforming sections.  Everything fixed!  Here's a link that explains how to do it:

[https://gamesgds.com/doom-eternal-how-to-fix-fist-ammo-and-troubles-using-console/](https://gamesgds.com/doom-eternal-how-to-fix-fist-ammo-and-troubles-using-console/)

You'll need cheat engine, so be careful if you play online, but I'm using this right now and it's amazing how much better the game plays.  You can still run out of ammo and there's still reasons to switch weapons, but you're not constantly running low.

Also, to the first person feels the need to point out ""the game was designed... and blah blah blah.""  I'd like to thank you for wholly original and valued input.

Steps to replicate: While in possession of a weapon that you have not yet completed the mastery for, load a level with the IDKFA cheat on, then complete the weapon mastery.

I want to take a break probably every 1/3 the game as I'm doing my ultra nightmare run. So I wanted to test it to make sure it works. So I beat the first mission and hit ""escape to main menu"" and was prompted with a ""Do you want to delete this save file message"". I went with it anyways to see and the save is gone upon going back to the file save screen.

Don't really want to do this in one sitting as of fear my game might crash (PC). It's only happened a few times but I don't want to risk a good run to a crash.

The turrets when getting to hayden are one thing, but the fact that i don't get to fire the BFG-10000 annoys me so much.

I know it seems like a small thing, but in a game where the satisfaction that comes from ripping and tearing is like half the fun it just takes me out of the moment when i don't get to fire the biggest guns.

Or different dimensions/universes? Is this like another version of the afterlife? Is Hell even an “afterlife” in this game or is it just another world/dimension? Are these Maykrs like angels from Heaven or are these just an aliens species from a different reality/planet? It’s all just a bit confusing because Hell traditionally isn’t a different “planet”, it’s the afterlife where bad people go to get tortured by demons. So if Hell is thebafterlife and the demons are supernatural beings then what exactly are the Sentinels and the Maykrs? What exactly is Sentinel Prime, Argent D’ur and Urdak, are these places like “afterlives” as well? Did the people on Earth know all about this crazy shit before the demons came?

Or is this kind of like how Norse Mythology is where the Vikings believed in different “realms” (the nine realms) and in the Doom universe Earth, Hell, Argent D’ur, Sentinel Prime etc etc are all different “realms”?.

frhrb9,DanoVonKoopa,Currently fighting the Last Boss... And it looks like the worst part of the game.,"My god, what a disappointment.

The insane AoE, damage, (bugged) force and speed of his attacks is one thing -it's still an issue, since you can't always dodge and one hit can  easily mean your death-

It's another thing to get instantly hit by something you couldn't possibly see coming, and cannot identify even as you're dead on the floor.

But my god that over-reliance  on adds is the worst I've ever seen. Having some enemies, even some powerful ones join the fight is ok, to keep the player busy, and keep him from always focusing the boss. I get that. But did you see the complete mess you've created Id? Did we need to have almost ALL enemy types here? Wouldn't it be nicer (and better, smarter design) to have selected a few key ones that actually fit the fight?

It's like Id took a look at all the rules of good boss design and decided to fuck them all, where they stood, right in the ass.

And I'm sure that's just the first phase of the fight. Or I hope so. I hope it ends with something better than that. Cause my god, after the brilliance of The Doom Hunter, Marauder, Gladiator, and Khan Maykr, I hope the game isn't ending on that mess of a boss.

frhq82,GeO4K,The Story of the slayer. Enjoy.,"In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.

Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before.

And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the seraphim bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Blood Temples. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the nine circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.

The age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the tablets of Hell across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.

None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the abyss rose The Great One, a champion mightier than all who had come before. The Titan, of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon the plain and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. The Titan fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow horde were routed.

And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer in a mighty armor, wrought in the forges of Hell, impenetrable and unyielding. With sword and shield of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void.

Yet as the mighty Titan fell and dread engulfed the armies of Doom, the demon priests of the Blood Temples laid a trap to capture this scourge of Hell. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Great One, the Hell Walker sought prey in the tombs of the Blood Keep. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the temple upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering.

Through all the evil that hell can make,
All the wickedness that mankind can produce,
We send unto them....
Only you...
For they are Brutal.
They are rage, without mercy.
But YOU.
YOU will be worse.

frhbrv,Fabsquared,(Brutal) Doom Eternal: Manipulation of console commands to make the game more brutal.,"If you are unaware, [modders unlocked the console, revealing previously hidden commands](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=11889). With this, it gives the player many interesting commands to play with and modify the game to their liking. As a huge Brutal DOOM / Project Brutality fan and player, I tried to mess with the variables to re-create what I liked the most about brutal doom: Looking back at the trail of destruction you left. Sadly, 2016 and Eternal let me down in that regard. There are no spent bullet casings on the floor, no limbs splattered everywhere, no bullet holes or blood decals, atleast for a significant time (1-3 seconds is too short.). It is understandable on a modern PoV. There are much more poligons to be rendered, post processing effects, particles, lightning effects, etc, where in the source ports they're simple, easy-to-draw sprites/2d textures. So, the computational power needed for drawing the same amount of details on the ""HD"" era is much, much higher. But that won't stop me/us from having fun, right? On the command and cvar [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/1CbBThTU), we can find these commands:  


gore\_neverFadeAndRemove 1

g\_goresplashjointsused 32

decal\_maxdecalsinradiust 40

decal\_forcefadeoutduration 600000

decal\_goreBloodPoolPriority 100

decal\_maxdecalgroupingradius 100.0

r\_decalLifetimeMultiplier 256

breakable\_NoFadeAndRemove 1

Sadly these don't have the effects I imaginated. 'gore\_neverFadeAndRemove 1' Doesn't seems to work, or just leave blood decals around for an unlimited time, which can be overwritten by the decal lifetime duration and/or multiplication. I'm still trying to figure the exact functionality of each of these cvars.  
Theres also another interesting variable:  


'ai\_death\_FadeDelay 60000' - It sounds promissing at first, but gets real trouble-y: The games thinks the 'corpses' are 'alive' and won't count them as 'dead' until it fades. This essentialy breaks encounters, as the next enemies that are needed for the encounter to finish are never spawned (or takes too long to). It also doesn't stops gibs from de-spawning (Blown out arms, legs, etc) - I'm still searching for whatever variable rules this.

frhbrs,AskTwispike,Hide and Seek???,"Is Battle Mode just a game of hide and seek? I love playing as the slayer and playing an aggressive playstyle, but I've come across many players who just like to play as the fastest demons who can run away or easily avoid the slayers attacks which mostly consists of the Maurauder, Archvile, and the Pain Elemental. I feel like if you play against a party of two demon players then most likely you'll always lose because of how they coordinate. 

So I'm just curious but is it still STRATEGY vs SKILL? The slayer is outnumbered by AI and two player controlled demons who can also heal each other and drop hazards.

If we are to understand that Doom 3 is just a retelling of Doom 1 from a more horror perspective, also notice that Doomslayer from Eternal clearly has black hair not red/brown as in Doom 1, along with other facial similarities. I like to infer from this (because I am actually a big fan of doom 3) that, that marine is the canon one that eventually went to earth in doom 2 and was trapped in hell in 64. Again this is more just fun interpretations from a doom 3 fan but I wondered if anyone else dug this. As a side note, it conveniently explains the tone shift from 3 being a horror game.

frgkh6,armorhide406,Samur Maykr,"So as many have noticed, Samur the Seraphim and Hayden share the same voice actor, as well as have very similar dialogue. The scientists even lament his brain and body have alien architecture.

VEGA asks if he's the Father. They also both know the Khan Maykr and Samuel seems to have inside knowledge of the Maykrs and condemns the process of creating Argent energy.

But personally, I don't think Samuel is Samur, nor is VEGA the Father. Samuel had a whole life, and had parts of his brain grafted into an advanced robotic body. VEGA was created by Samuel using artifacts from Hell. There's supposed to be an eight month gap between the games, plenty of time for them to learn about Hell and the Maykrs. Samuel was on Earth kicking Hell's ass and suffered CRITICAL DAMAGE. Perhaps this was an opening for Samur. As a cyborg perhaps he resisted Hell's influence but what about an angel (or yknow, what basically inspired the whole idea as an extradimensional alien)

As for VEGA, perhaps there was latent subroutines of the Father (implied to be an extremely advanced AI) and it took over him. Although I don't have any good answer as to how he fit into the Fortress of Doom so well, but that backup couldn't have possibly contained his entire intellect given the vastness of the facility in 2016 and maybe since the Fortress is of Maykr design but for Argenta use, something about the Slayer's suit storing VEGA before he got to the Fortress might have helped compatibility?

Point is, I heard the DLC will cover what happened between 2016 and Eternal, so I hope we get those questions answered.",3,1585527594,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frgkh6/samur_maykr/,Doom,0

frggaz,KeifersIsAwesome,FOR THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT THE BACKGROUND LORE OF ETERNAL AND 2016,"This is a copy pasting of a giant dump I did in the Doom Discord. I'll preface by saying that I think the interconnecting and deep lore that expands on 2016's established lore is very well done and makes sense. However I've run across a problem in sorting out the Argent Energy part of it, and I'd like some other opinions/corrections/takes on what I've put together here.

 Alright, I've gone back through the Soul Spire. The Codex describes that human souls are mixed together with wraith energy and then subjected to hellfire. What comes from that is the energy that Hell uses. BUT Hell does not have access to the wraiths anymore. This doesn't really matter though as, like we saw in Taras Nabad, Argent D'Nur has reserves of wraith energy themselves, and given how powerful it is, and the short time between 2016 and Eternal, It's probably safe to say they wouldn't have run out any time soon. It's not a stretch to imagine that the Essence and Wraith energy can be combined on Argent D'Nur. The soul spire you travel through processes raw souls and through some unknown process turns it into Maykr energy at the top. So the Maykrs do not need the combined energy. Hell themselves can no longer use the Wraith Bolstered essence, seeing as how Argent powered Demons are no longer around. This now brings up a few interesting things. If Argent D'Nur is being sent raw Essence, why would they fashion weapons out of it? The raw essence is shown as blue, and when the Slayer arrives at Sentinel Prime, the spears he is greeted with are Blue. Then after he kills Deag Grav, the spears are Red, signifying Wraith strengthened weaponry. Why use the blue ones in the first place? Why willingly weaken your weaponry? Then there's the subject of Wraith Fire, and Wraith powered weapons. The Crucible, and the Betrayer's hammer are powered only by Wraith Fire. This is confirmed by the Sentinel codex entries saying that they lacked the strength brought on by the essence, but remained pure, meaning powered only by Wraith Fire. The red spears and the Marauder's axe though, must be strengthened by the essence as well, yet they look indistinguishable from the weapons powered only by wraith fire. 

 Finally, there is the Mars facility and the terminology used to describe all these things. The Mars facility, under the watch of Hayden, was, as we can surmise by Eternal's context, removing Wraith Energy from Argent Energy. This however, is a problem as it is said that Argent energy is made in the Maykr factories, and what Samuel was pulling from the fissure was coming directly from the Wraiths, meaning that he was actually imbuing it with souls. But that doesn't make sense either as it seems that Wraith imbued Hell Essence is bright red. The place where the wraiths are is also called the Well, and in that logic it could be assumed that the place where the wraiths are is a spot where Essense is coalesced, and simply becasue the wraiths are there, it just fuses the two together, In which case, the Mars facility would indeed be removing the Wraith Energy from what they were gathering. That leads to the question of why? The say they are filtering and refining it, but how is it you can be refining it if you are returning it to its raw state? Maybe human technology can't handle the full power of argent energy? If that's the case, why is the hell Crucible, a source of pure Wraith Energy, needed to recreate argent energy when you don't have souls in the first place? Unless the wraiths were so far gone that the energy flowing and overtaking them, WAS combined argent energy and the Hell crucible is actually filled with Combined energy.

 This leads to the problem of how they describe it all. Fresh souls are called Essence by hell, but Samuel calls is Raw Argent energy, and in the previous game, called the combined form Pure Argent energy, but then when they return it to the blue state they called it refined argent energy.

frgcpa,yew0tm8,(Discussion Wanted) Strafing Left/Right reduces Forward Movement speed temporarily. Pros/Cons/Why?,"TL;DR: Why does strafing left/right rapidly inhibit your forward movement speed temporarily?  Was this decision made by the devs intentionally--if so, why?

(Disclaimer, I am on a PC with mouse and keyboard)

Games like Doom 2016, Doom Eternal, Apex Legends all have this movement feature (Bug? Oversight? Handicap?) and I have been struggling to understand why.

I am both fascinated, and annoyed with this because, on one hand, it's realistic to be slowed down when strafing left/right... but as an old school arena shooter, anything that slows down my forward momentum annoys me, because I am used to evading projectiles, while running up on the enemy.

I find that handicapping forward movement speed, means that I have to change strafe directions less often, it makes me more predictable, makes me an easier target for the enemy (AI and human players both depending on the game), and generally makes the game less enjoyable for me because I have to concentrate more on making intentional pre-planned strafe decisions, rather than split second mind changes while strafing, and it causes me to take longer to get closer to the enemy, and increases the likelihood that I will die.

This is not an issue of me, not being able to adapt and overcome.  I can certainly learn the rules of any game, and adjust accordingly.  This is an issue of me, trying to understand why this feature/bug/handicap is in the game.

Is this a result of movement code being pulled from other games and being added to Doom/Doom Eternal?  Is this a handicap geared towards PC players to prevent them from having a movement advantage over console players?",1,1585526791,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frgcpa/discussion_wanted_strafing_leftright_reduces/,Doom,3

An example that shows this quite well is the Inferno Marauder skin, the flames around the axe and the crown display properly, but the colors still match the base skin (so white skin instead of red and base armor color instead of the set's color which is black).

Upon further review they display just fine in the match (astro skin looks white in match, and like the standard praetor suit in lobby). But the player themselves cant enjoy a lot of their own Cosmetics if they aren't displayed properly in the lobby.

I have got a problem and you can help me.
I was playing at nightmare difficult and I was at the ""Taras Nabad"" level (9th level). My game crashed and now that save file is corrupted, I can't continue it.
I can 2 do things
1) Restart all from the beginning
2) Hope I can find someone that wants to give me his game files
If you are playing at nightmare difficult, you can help me even if you are (for example) at the 3rd level.
The save files are located here

You find a folder with a strange name, the name of the folder is essential to use the save files because is the crypt key of the files. Mine, for example, is ""ddft17ge-958e-43d0-72k8-6e7wn7s77g4c""
You can send me this folder or, if you prefer, all your ""DOOMEternal"" folder, it's just a couple of megabytes.
If you don't want to send me all the folder because you think there may be some ""private"" files, don't worry. I need just the ""long folder name"" above and the files into ""GAME-AUTOSAVE0""

frfvya,telmnec,Collectibles and pace,"I just wanted to say that I think it's a little bit of a shame to see the upgradds hidden as secret collectibles once again.
The game has a great pace, very nervous and tense. Combats are insanely fun to have and progressing through each level is a huge pleasure.

But, there's an issue. If you want to truly enjoy the possibilities offered by the devs for you in combat etc, you need to roam through every inch of each level once they are cleaned to ensure you find those ""sweet"" collectibles people seem so fond of.

Don't mistake me. I also enjoy a bit of exploration, and secrets and Easter eggs are almost always funny once found.

All I'm saying is, this intensive roaming to find upgrades definitely kills the pace of the game. It's like you're having a ton of fun actually doing what the game wants you to and what the game is famous for, and then if you want to feel truly powerful, now comes the boring part. Breaking the pace from fast and exciting to somewhat slow, boring and sometimes even frustrating. Plus, sometimes I think these secrets make you spent way too much time looking at everything everywhere, and the frustration of finding a simple collectible or song for instance is clearly higher than the surprise or the happiness of the said collectible in my opinion.

I like playing games in higher difficulties, because I feel like ""normal"" difficulties sometimes don't offer quite a challenge and let you chew through the game like air. But in higher difficulties, if you want to avoid this awful pace-killing roaming stuff, you're gonna have a wayyy harder time later in the game and you're not gonna have those upgrades that sometimes just make the game funnier and more enjoyable.

I'm not saying there should not be exploration at all.
I'm not saying there should not be secrets in levels, as there has always been in older games. All I'm saying is that secrets should be purely optional. I'm not saying that players should be given all upgrades and mods simply by playing, but don't make us examine every square inch of the level to find them.

I really enjoyed Doom (2016) and I also enjoyed Doom Eternal, but sadly, this ""secret upgrades"" stuff is kind of killing part of the fun for me. 

I hope they had fun creating the game but I really hope for developers to drop this annoying ""collectible-frenzy"" they had for the last few years in games.

Anyway this is my opinion, my little rant let's say but I'm curious to hear what you guys think about this, I'd love to hear your arguments no matter what your position on the topic is.

* Stand too far and you deal with incredibly fast, large and hard to dodge projectiles
* Stand too close and you deal with unpreventable damage
* The attackable range on them is so incredibly specific
* The attackable timing is incredibly short and can only get two shots
* They require the use of 2-3 guns (super shotgun, ballista, rocket launcher) that already have limited ammo, one of which has incredible utility. Due to the limited window, slow, high-damage weapons are incredibly preferred.
* Their dogs can kiss the fattest part of my ass
* Unlike other demons, which are arguably more difficult, cannot be one-shot by super guns
* **And worst of all, there are no weaknesses.** Even the Archvile's worst ability can be countered

Just do something about this asshole.

* Increase the attackable range
   * Make him dash farther, whatever. I'm assuming this is partly done for animation reasons but given how annoying he is, I don't care.
* Increase the attackable time. Three shots in means he dies 1/3rd faster. I'd love that.

frfhld,iswearimnotcopper,Only bug I’ve found (plus a couple other things),"I’ve already clocked in probably about 40 hours and the only bug I’ve seen in 2 playthroughs and lots of multiplayer is that I’ve had the marauder freeze in place on a few occasions. He just stopped moving and he would continue tracking me so if it happened while his shield was up I had to restart entire battles. It’s only happened on 3 occasions so it doesn’t seem common and I haven’t seen it mentioned anywhere else. Also, idk if it’s server side or client side but lag is horrendous in battlemode. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been able to just melt the slayer cus he froze midair or how many times I’ve teleported and still been taking damage cus the demons could still see me. And the last thing, which I don’t want to call a bug cus I’m not sure if it is or not. idk if this is just me having awkward positioning or something but sometimes I’ll just get stuck. Specifically if I get cornered it’ll almost be like my character is floating. I can’t jump, move, or vault for a couple seconds.

frfgmm,AdiMercury,Slayer gates - information needed,"Hi guys. Need info on Slayer Gates:

-Where do I see the number of Empyrean Keys collected so far?


-Are keys properly collected if you replay a level at lower difficulty (I'm Too Young To Die) than the one you are currently playing the campaign (in my case Ultra-Violence)? Because I'm currently replaying levels where I left gates behind and collecting the keys (have 3 missing, one of them in the level I am currently in).

My aim is to get the Unmaykr while still blind-running the game rather than obtaining it as an endgame activity.

frf3we,Deathly_Drained,Won as the Slayer 3 times in a row! So proud of myself,"I was feeling a bit down so I got onto Doom Eternal to play some Battle mode and I decided to try out as the Slayer after failing a few times in the past. 

I think I found the key to this.

I was reminding myself through out the battles and it worked, here's what I was doing.

1. Constantly using the dash, bars and jump pads. The slayer is MUCH faster than the demons, I used this to my advantage.
2. I kept reminding myself to exploit the summon demon's weaknesses. Cacodemon can be instant killed by grenade and the Aracnotron main gun can be taken out.
3. Don't be afraid to back-off. This is a big part that I found, if I just rush down and get the rushy feeling and try and kill the demons. I will die, I take a step back and deal with some of the summoned, burn and glory kill to get both health and armor.
4. Ballista still does extra damage to flying creatures. 
5. Usually, when I felt confident that I can kill the demon players, I would use in using a mix of sticky bombs, flames and especially the plasma gun with the heat blast.
6. Try and outsmart them. I learned very quickly that the demons are much more powerful than you and you can't beat them head-on. Hide and sneak up behind one and blood-punch + chain-gun or shotgun and suddenly they're in critical health. Try and split them up too.

Man, it was intense. But really damn fun. I hope these tips help!",0,1585522314,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frf3we/won_as_the_slayer_3_times_in_a_row_so_proud_of/,Doom,2

freovs,kylethetree,Doom Eternal kinda sucks,"Just finished the campaign on hurt me plenty and frankly I was pretty disappointed this game doesn’t stand up to Doom 2016 at all in my opinion. 

The ammo system is incredibly frustrating I’m constantly running out of ammo for all my guns and I’m forced to use the chainsaw. I liked how in the first game you only had to use it sparingly when you were desperate for ammo. 

The bosses are absolutely horrendous. Every single boss you fight immediately turns into a mob boss save for the final two bosses. None of the bosses feel unique or cool since I know I’m just going to be fighting them from now on. On that note the marauder is probably the most frustrating and least fun enemy I’ve ever seen in a video game. He punishes you for playing aggressively and you essentially just have to sit there until you get the go ahead from the green flashes completely ruining any flow you might have gotten in the fight. 

The lore of the game was convoluted and made absolutely no sense at all. I’m not sure if this is supposed to be overcompensating for the lack of a real story in Doom 2016 but I didn’t know what was going on half the time since it feels like they just made this weird fantasy story up as they went. 

Overall I was thoroughly disappointed in this game I very rarely got the rush of adrenaline I got from the first game and instead the game just felt like a chore of grinding through areas to advance.

It was at this moment my sister asked me to help her carry some things out to the car. I pressed the home button on my PS4 controller while the loading screen was still up. I figured the game would pause once it stopped loading. It didn’t.

When I got back and opened the game It told me I had died and gave me the option to start over. I don’t understand why it didn’t pause since most games I’ve done this with do in that situation. I obviously don’t blame my sister, but I’m pretty peeved right now.

I think Samuel Hayden is a GREAT character.  Therefore, I was completely geeking out in Doom Eternal when the Slayer goes back and retrieves Hayden's half remaining cyber corpse.  And when the Slayer hooked up Hayden to the ship's mainframe and we start getting Hayden's guidance in the ensuing missions... just awesome!  But man oh man... when it shows the Slayer's past and we see Serpahim aiding the Slayer by making him even more powerful and it's clear that the Seraphim is Hayden, what an incredible twist... pure AWESOME!!  🤯🤯🤯",6,1585520631,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fremvj/doom_slayer_and_samuel_hayden_spoilers/,Doom,7

frei5l,WookieSin,Regarding the Marauder: A Brief Essay,"This Sentinel-turned Demon has been a polarizing subject in the DOOM community since the release of Eternal, and I'd like try and find some common ground here. *While I don't believe this demon is unfair, I do believe that it doesn't follow the DOOM formula.*

Can the Marauder prove difficult? Certainly. Just about every player had a tough time with their first encounter against him. Hell, I got extremely lucky after a few attempts to kill him and he glitched through the floor, insta-killing him out of bounds. However, instead of finishing the level, the first thing I did was load the last checkpoint. I wanted to *learn* how to beat this thing before I could continue.

Unfortunately, that didn't work. ""I'll get him the next time."" I told myself. It was only after I finished the campaign when I saw the Balista/SSG strategy. Learning that was a big key to not just killing a Marauder, but killing one efficiently.

However, the problem that can't go away is in the Marauder's core design. Plenty have stated that it's a game of Red light/Green light. I fully agree with this. It really hurts your momentum when instead of juggling an entire arena full of demons, 100% of your focus has to turn on only 1 opponent. The entire board is cleared just so you both have room to fight each other. While this is fine design, it goes against the grain of what DOOM 2016 &amp; Eternal are trying to go for: A power fantasy of 1 man against the countless hordes of Hell.

This all in mind, 1 demon missing the mark out of over 20 is by no means bad, especially considering he only shows up 6(?) times in the entire run of the campaign. Maybe if we get a sequel ID can take in the feedback and look to improve the design of this enemy, whether that be lowering the health pool he has or lowering his aggression to not rival a Hell Knight.

DOOM Eternal has been one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The Marauder is but a single speed bump on an otherwise fast &amp; smooth ride, and I'm happy to board it over and over again!",0,1585520174,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frei5l/regarding_the_marauder_a_brief_essay/,Doom,4

frege5,iannoyubadly,Can we talk about how good this game is?,"Okay, so got this game on PS4, and quickly realizing this is probably the best game I’ve played in years. 

Number one, it’s challenging. Its not just stupid “ahh stray grenade got me” or “play on veteran difficulty and the enemy hits 100% of shots no matter what” kind of challenging. As we’ve all seen there are a ton of kids jumping in this sub who say the game sucks two hours in - there’s a real learning curve to the mechanics and unwritten rules that make this actually challenging to pick up. That said, once you get it, it’s really really satisfying gameplay and there’s a real rush involved jumping around and getting in close to the action.

Number two, it’s fucking cool. DOOM has always been cool but Jesus Christ, some of the lore rolled out in this game and the carrots in game elements that reveal the public’s perception of doomguy enforce the fact that this game is cool as shit and makes you feel cool as shit. The music? Cool. The visuals? Cool. The gameplay? Cool. Glory kills? Cool. Weapons? Cool. This game is essentially the deal with it sunglasses incarnate.

Number three, value. Prior to this I was playing MW a lot, really enjoyed it, but mostly felt like I was grinding away. Chasing kill streaks, camos, maybe playing a bit with my friends, but it was only really just fine. The campaign was very short, and multiplayer was essentially just what you’d expect from COD. DE on the other hand has a long campaign, like 22 hours not including me dying a lot and the innate desire to try higher difficulties as I learn the mechanics and get more confident. It’s probably going to take me a long time to 100% this and I’m actually happy about that because I love this game and look forward to playing through it a few more times. 

Then the multiplayer, while others haven’t liked it, I’ve played a few rounds as the slayer and find it to be a lot of fun. It’s hard, yes, and the odds of doing well as the slayer are steep, but I genuinely love the challenge. It’s distinctly *not* like other multiplayer experiences out there in that it’s not just TDM with the goal being to keep a high KDR and unlock weapons. With this mode you really have to use all the tools at your disposal to take out both of the demons quickly, protect your health and ammo, and contend with all of the bots at the same time. It’s constantly in flux - sometimes you’re ahead, and then suddenly you’re glory killing computers for health. Sometimes you get a kill, but can’t finish the job before the demon respawns. Hard to describe, but it’s just a totally different experience and as they update the game I think it could get even better. 

Overall I think this game is really great, and it gives me Gears of War vs Halo vibes in terms of likely being something that won’t become the number one game in terms of players (with Halo being MW), but will likely redefine how we think about shooters going into the future in a way nobody was expecting.",0,1585519992,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frege5/can_we_talk_about_how_good_this_game_is/,Doom,1

frdpow,Mrjiggles248,What defeated,"Samuel Hayden 

Doom Eternal was fantastic but one of my complaints was Samuels defeat.

To recap just how powerful Hayden is he went to hell with a group of soldier to retrieve the Doom Slayer in his tomb prison, which we can see through holograms.

&amp;#x200B;

By the end all the soldiers had died and Hayden finished retrieving the Tomb himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

We can assume that unless the demons are completely brain dead that the tomb would've been heavily guarded, in addition Hayden did not take any weapons which would imply he defeated hordes of demons mano a mano, and to top it all off Hayden does not appear to receive any injuries in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

When you finally meet Hayden he is indestructible the only character in all of doom 2016 to be that way. Even the super shotgun does 0 damage, this would imply that Hayden durability is significantly higher than boss level characters from doom 2016 such as cyberdemon, hell guards, and spider mastermind. Furthermore if we compare it to Doom eternal even the Icon of Sin is damaged by the super shotgun. Being that Doom Eternal is a different game it's fine to assume that maybe the super shotgun and Doom Slayer are significantly different from the previous game. But even then that would easily put Hayden as a boss+ tier character.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore Hayden who did not use any weapons now has the powerful crucible to wield which would only make him stronger like it made the Doom Slayer stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly there is strong evidence that Samuel Hayden is the Serraphim, the right hand of the Khan Makyr which would only lend to his credibility as a powerful and knowledgeable being.

&amp;#x200B;

When you arrive at the arc complex mission it is stated that Hayden has just been recently defeated, there appears to be no large beings(besides the tentacle thingys) such as titans in the area as you would've been able to see one since the battle would've just finished. This means it would've had to been a smaller demon that defeated Hayden. Due to the timing and ability to cast portals this leads us to believe that the Marauder would by the most likely suspect to have defeated Hayden. 

&amp;#x200B;

This brings up a couple of problems first the Marauder seems to be completely uninjured by the fight with Hayden. Hayden besides being cut in half also seems to have small wounds all over his body, now the Marauder has the super shotgun but as explained earlier it did no damage before so It's weird that now it does significant damage to Hayden. The marauder also has a small disconnect from his lore and game play power levels. From a lore perspective the marauder would be a boss tier level enemy but from a game play perspective the Marauder is a challenging mini-boss. It's weird to think that a Marauder a follower of the Makyrs would be so easily able to defeat what is most likely the right hand of Khan Makyr in a 1 on 1 fight.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to know your thoughts on the matter

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR** Hayden defeated to easily by unknown enemy despite from a lore and game play perspective easily being shown as an extremely powerful boss+ level being. Marauder was most likely to have been the one to defeat him but things don't exactly add up, such as the Marauder being completely uninjured and Hayden being able to be wounded by a super shotty after showcasing being impervious to doom slayers weapons including super shotty.",3,1585517367,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frdpow/what_defeated/,Doom,1

frd7vr,Majonese,Survey about First-Person-Shooter gameplay,"Hello everyone,

I am currently working on my bachelor thesis and as part of that, I am examining how different gameplay elements that are typical for old-school first person shooters (e.g. Doom, Descent) can be implemented into modern military first person shooters (e.g. Call of Duty, Battlefield). The focus lies on aspects directly surrounding singleplayer gunplay while leaving out any additional elements like progression systems, story, graphics or immersion and also multiplayer gameplay.

With Doom Eternal just being released (and being great) and many recent shooters adopting a lot of ""old-school"" shooter gameplay rather than following the template established by Call of Duty and similar games, it seems like the perfect opportunity to examine the working of First-Person Shooter gameplay more closely. Thinking of it, Doom 2016 and now Doom Eternal kinda are the reason for me to choose this topic in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, as part of this research, I am conducting a video survey which shows different implementations of ""old-school"" shooter gameplay into a functional prototype of a modern first person shooter. It consists of 4 short videos with one short survey each. Watching the videos and completing the survey should take around 15 minutes.

To allow linking the results of 4 surveys to each other, the first question of each survey asks you to enter a code word which can be any word or combination of letters you like. Please make sure that this code is the same for every survey.

If you want to participate to help me with this project, watch the first video here:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqUNpMF0iWA&amp;t=32s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqUNpMF0iWA&amp;t=32s)

Follow the steps described at the end of each video and each survey to complete it. Please complete all 4 surveys, otherwise your results cannot be used.

Huge thanks to everyone who participates! I know how valuable one's time is and I really appreciate any help with this project!

frckro,Subrezon,Dual monitor issues with Doom Eternal,"Haven't found anywhere I can report bugs, so here goes. Maybe someone from id will see this.

My setup includes two monitors, one positioned vertically. The main/horizontal monitor is set as main display in both Windows and Nvidia Control Panel, and is also plugged into the main port in the GPU (as in, it's the one that BIOS shows up on). 

Yet Doom Eternal decided to launch on the secondary one, and since it is vertical - it doesn't manage to start. I unplugged the main monitor, set the secondary to horizontal, started Doom on the secondary monitor, plugged the main one in and switched to it in the settings. This is too many hoops to go through, no other game required me to do it.

Also, the displays go to sleep if you go away from the PC, unlike in any other game. And if this happens - the right half of the main monitor gets covered in colored stripes, that don't disappear even after you close Doom Eternal, only upon turning the monitor on/off. All of this may be a driver issue, but I wasn't able to reproduce it with other games, but consistently with Doom Eternal.

Here are the photos of this behavior (screenshots don't retain the stripes):

So I’ve been hearing the hype over the last few weeks about Doom Eternal. So I thought I would play Doom to get behind the story and just see what the game is about, now I have only played it on the easiest setting, just so I could story and try to take as much more as possible in. 

My. God. I’ve missed so much. The game was absolutely brilliant and the soundtrack, the freaking SOUNDTRACK! As you slaughter demons with glory kills and the music is pumping, you just feel like a god. 
Also listing to the Slayer recordings and finding out the demons are terrified of you is pure perfection. 
I saw memes about the music being the demons horror music and not yours and they are right. 

I am definitely going to get Doom Eternal when I get some money and I just can’t wait! I’m itching at the thought of laying siege to demons, or blasting away like a madman, all I want to do is just go on a rampage. I guess what I really want to do is;

1. The demons can corner you really fucking fast, which means in a matter of milliseconds you're dead.

""Smoke all over the place? What? The fuck is he talking about?"" Well, let me explain.

As it says, there's smoke all over the place. I just met a marauder and a mancubus, it was quite fun, until smoke started to appear in the third round. Some where, some how, there was something in the game that triggered a big ass fucking smoke bomb of sorts, I couldn't see jack fucking shit. Making it impossible to know where I was.  
Best part? I was stuck between the player mancubus, and a Arachnatron. What the fuck!? Since when did smoke bombs be okay to detonate mid fucking battle!?

&amp;#x200B;

frbrvg,JoltinJoeDimaggio,Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Doom Eternal,"After completing Doom Eternal on Ultra Violence with all but one offline achievement, I thought I’d share some things I wish I knew when I started the game:

1. If you’re struggling with dying, you can replay old levels to get as many lives as you want. As you collect cheat codes it becomes even easier to replay levels. I like to use a level with a life right in the beginning, you load in, collect the life then exit and reload the level to collect lives more quickly 

2. Maybe I missed a tutorial somewhere but it wasn’t until halfway through the game I realized sentinel batteries unlock the cells in the Fortress of Doom ship

3. The chainsaw isn’t to be used the same way as in Doom 2016, for awhile I kept trying to conserve fuel for larger demons but found it impossible, once you let go and use it relentlessly on smaller demons for ammo battles get easier, plus one chainsaw charge refills in its own without fuel after about 30 seconds 

4. Max out the 5 spot explosive shotgun and ice bomb asap, most large enemies die from freezing and unloading 5 shots into them along with throwing frag grenades

5. Use your equipment. This one sounds obvious but when I started I didn’t take the flame belch seriously, not only does it make larger demons easier to kill but it also drop copious amount of armor, so if you come across some zombies by themselves take your time to burn a few and stock up on ammo and armor. And if able I like to burn enemies right before I glory kill them for some extra rewards 

6. For runes your loadout should change based on where you’re at in the game, when I’m in a crazy platforming section equip the Air Control rune for more precise landings. For crazy battles I like Equipment Fiend and Seek and Destroy

7. For suit upgrades, upgrade your freeze bomb and dash first, and frag grenades (note the very last upgrade I did was the frag grenade stagger because I saw it as a negative upgrade as the second grandes do less damage and only stagger). I did environmental upgrades and exploration last as well as YouTube helped with a lot of secrets rather than use valuable suit points on exploration early on 

I wanted to make this post because I wasn’t having a lot of fun with this game when I started, I was frustrated all the time but as I started to figure some of these things out I really started to love the game and overall enjoyed it",1,1585510610,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/frbrvg/things_i_wish_i_knew_when_i_started_doom_eternal/,Doom,3

Is armor provided as a function of the health of the demon or does each demon on fire provided the same amount of armor? (i.e. if I light up 3 mancubus will I get the same armor as 3 fodder zombies?

**Let the games begin!**: We’ll start allowing gameplay clips on the subreddit. Still no Let’s Plays, and no Twitch streams (with a few exceptions, please message us for permission).

Which is why the Crucible in execution seemed really underwhelming, it felt more like a get out jail free card than a tool that had to be used often in combat to even the odds. The only time i ever used the crucible was when i didn't want to deal with an Arch-vile and during the final battle when the game just hands out crucible charges like free samples because in the main game their were pretty scarce, which makes the crucible seem like a new pair of expensive shoes that you don't wear in public so they wont get dirty.

fr8ch0,tesla323,Some thoughts about Doom Eternal...,"I'm about 6-ish hours into the campaign, and here are some of my thoughts so far...

I personally prefer Doom 2016 for its darker, more horror-esque atmosphere, but Eternal's atmosphere feels more like a 'Doom' game. It's over-the-top, gory, cartoony fun, but I think that makes it feel more like the originals. Like if Carmack and Romero had had the current level of technology, Eternal is close to what they would have made. 

The combat loop is not as bad as a lot of people seem to be complaining about, but I still prefer the freedom of Doom 2016. In Eternal, it feels like the devs are saying, ""here's your weapons, and here's how we're making you use them."" In Doom 2016, it's more like ""here's your weapons, use them however you want."" I feel like the combat loop is easy to learn, but cheapens the experience a lot by making every encounter feel exactly the same. 

My gosh, the platforming. Man I hate the platforming. It's frustrating, breaks the flow of the game, and I constantly dread having to face yet ANOTHER platforming puzzle. I mean, it makes sense for there to be a challenge to get to secret areas, but why make it part of the necessary progression of the campaign? The wall-climbing especially feels out of place. 

I really like his Fortress of Solitude, er, Doom I mean. I've never thought about what Doomguy's lair would look like, but it's perfect.

The HUD and UI is too cluttered for me, although I admit that's probably nitpicky. It was definitely overwhelming at first, and I'm still learning what some of the icons are for. Again, this is probably too nitpicky, but I much prefer a more minimalist UI. 

Blood Lunch is a nice surprise! I really don't mind the 'useless' melee, Blood Punch really makes up for it, especially after you level it up some.

fr8apc,Im_a_Miztake,DOOM (2016): A New Fan's Perspective,"Hello to everybody who decided to click on this post! (Not sure why you would do that, but thanks anyway!) This is an essay/gush piece that I wrote about the 2016 release of Doom, and how me, a 17 year old whom had never experienced a Doom game, fell in love with a franchise from a genre that I had long since left behind. Enjoy!

***A Little Backstory:*** *I left first person shooters behind after I finished the campaign of Black-Ops 3, as a matter of fact I left most ""gun combat"" games behind in general, thus explaining why I never played things like PUBG or Fortnite. I saw single-player experiences begin to suffer in the wake of what I like to call, ""The EA Model"" (I.E. give everybody a gun and make them pay for the cool shit). This is when I found myself turning to a bit of an odd are of gaming from somebody with my history in the medium: Nintendo. I began playing what is now one of my favorite franchises of all time, The Legend of Zelda. I played these styles of games for years, and I was content. there was no multiplayer, no toxic lobbies with the kid who had the bubble-blowing icon for their Xbox profile. (we all ran into that dick in a COD lobby right?) Safe to say, I was content with leaving shooters behind, and had completely lost interest in any form of online game. (And no I haven't played Doom's online either, I'm just emphasizing what drove me away from FPS in the first place.)* 

Fast forward to me three weeks ago. Got my ass slammed into quarantine, had $30 in my steam wallet, and had completely exhausted my current library of games both on my switch and on my PC. Now, I will admit, technically I had gotten back into FPS before Doom, and that was through Fallout 4, but I play in Third Person and it's structured far differently than most shooters due to its RPG elements... anyway I'm getting off track. Because I played a lot of Fallout 4, Steam recommended a game to me. A game that would forever change my life as a gamer. DOOM. I had heard of the franchise of course, and was all too familiar with E1M1, the single most kick ass retro soundtrack title. My thoughts went something like this. ""Eh, fuck it, ill give it a shot, I can always refund it. Oh he there's a demo! Even better!"" And so, I hit the button, and 10 minutes later I hit the play button. Safe to say after about 20 minutes of the demo, I was fucking hurling my money at the computer screen to make the full game download faster.

*Now, full disclosure, there is nothing that I can say about this game that hasn't already been said, but I'm gonna do it anyway because... Well because I fucking love this game.* 

From the second that Mick Gordon's Electro-Metal hit my ear drums in the menus, I could feel my heart begin to race faster as my muscles clenched. When the Slayer bashed that imp's head against the sarcophagus, my ass cheeks hardened as they squeezed hard enough to make a diamond out of coal. Then, when The Doom Slayer punched the monitor to tell Hayden to shut the fuck up and the title screen blasting in my face, I got a testosterone powered rage boner, and began killing everything that moved, pure adrenaline flowing through me as I fired. 

*Was that description a little weird? Eh.. yeah... yeah it was. But fuck it this is my post so I will describe gaming boners if I want to.* 

Anyway, This game immediately just... clicked. No limits, no reloading, no lowering your gun to go fast, and the glory kills. Oh my GOD the glory kills. Doom made me feel something that I hadn't gotten for the longest time in a video game. It was a sense of pure freedom and euphoria that presented itself in such a way that I was on the edge of my seat, saying 'Fuck yeah!!!"" through gritted teeth and an ear to ear smile. the way the soundtrack paused and adapted to what was going on in the game, the sheer fluidity of the movement and the speed of which it presents itself, it all culminated in this near organismic whirlwind of violence and fun.

This however, wasn't all that I enjoyed about doom, oh far from it. As a matter of fact, one my favorite parts of this near masterpiece was the story. Doom has the unique approach of presenting its story mainly through data entries and logs rather than conventional cut-scenes, and I think this is absolutely fucking brilliant. Doom's game-play is best described in its opening moments, in this one singular quote. *""Rip and tear... until it is done.""* And fuck me sideways and call me Jimothy, does it ever fucking deliver. The game-play shouldn't and isn't, bogged down by heavy story dumps or characters talking CONSTANTLY as you're trying to tear the ass off of a Pinky. Instead, it gives you the *option* of learning what's going on, or you can choose to say ""fuck this, I want to shoot shit."" The feeling of choice in a game like this is pivotal, because ID Software have developed the ultimate vehicle for pure, uninterrupted fun, and they know it.  For someone like me, its nice to have the backstory, because yes, I am a bit of a nerd, but I also hate it when I'm finally getting into the flow of a game, only to have my thunder shit on by a cinematic.

Now, what can I say about the soundtrack that hasn't been said already by someone else? The simple answer is, I can't. It's fucking brilliant, Mick Gordon is a goddamn madman and a genius and he deserves every bit of praise that everyone gives him. I watched his YouTube videos on making the tracks last night and the Fact-Fiend video showing how he put pentagrams in the spectographs. I... he's fucking amazing. Moving on.

*Now we get to the part that is probably gonna piss some people off, so if you are of the mindset that any criticism of this game is sacrilege, sorry pal, but I believe that nothing is perfect. That being said, DOOM is fucking amazing and I love it to bits.*

There are a few outstanding criticisms of Doom that I believe are very fair, and I will name the ones that I personally do wish would be improved. These things are not bad, they just could be elevated a little further. To kick things off, I personally think that the glory kills aren't varied enough. Minor qualm, I want to see demons die in more varied and brutal ways. The second gripe, which is again, not a deal breaker, just something small, but I feel like the combat was mainly... I'm not really sure how to describe this but... It felt like every time that I came across a group of demons it was in a Colosseum of sorts. I felt like I was being thrown from one cage rage to another with nothing substantial in between. The arena mach game-play is fun as all hell, but I feel like the in between areas could have presented some unique combat situations as well.

All in all, Doom 2016 is an absolutely beautiful showcase of why single-player experiences shouldn't be replaced by live service games. It is a testament to just how much goddamn, pure fucking fun you can have on your own. (Kinda fitting for a guy stuck in quarantine huh?) Not to say that games such as Fortnite or whatever the kids are playing these days should go away, far from it in fact. It's more a message that every game style should be treated with respect. Fortnite has it's fans, and that's okay! However, studios shouldn't look down or cast aside the single-player games, (Looking at you EA, you have a good thing going with Jedi: Fallen Order, don't fuck it up!), they deserve respect, and in the case of Doom? Doom fucking DEMANDS that you respect it. Doom is loud, proud, and it damn well deserves it. after 12 years of being on a hiatus, this was an amazing comeback, and couldn't have come at a better time. 

My only regret? Not working one more shift before I was put in quarantine so I could buy Doom Eternal too.

So, what are my impressions of Doom, coming from a kid who had never played one before, disliked online/live service, and had come from playing Nintendo games for the better part of 5 years? Refreshing. God damn, was this refreshing. It has easily become one of my favorite games of all time. The game-play is phenomenally fun, the soundtrack in and of itself is a reason to play the game, and it is an in your face *""I'M HERE TOO BITCHES!""* to the over-saturated gaming market filled with online live games. Will this get me back into FPS as a whole? Probably not. COD and Battlefield still don't seem all that appealing, but stuff like Half-Life and Portal are now definitely worth a shot. I am definitely going to go back and play the original titles, (Excluding Doom 3 because based on what I've read, seen, and heard of it doesn't really feel like Doom), and as soon as I can pony up the cash, You know that the last bit of space on my hard-drive will be dedicated to Doom Eternal. Doom is now a huge part of my gaming life, and will be for years to come.

*Thanks for reading... Whatever the fuck this was! I don't really know how to end a post like this on Reddit as I'm still fairly new to the platform so um... FUCK! Okay... bye.*",0,1585498364,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr8apc/doom_2016_a_new_fans_perspective/,Doom,1

fr7tz1,Xeriam,The nitpickiest take: They should have built the chainsaw into the armblade!,"Despite it's integration into Glory Kill's, the armblade feels kinda underutilized to me, especially with melee not doing much sans Blood Punch. It also isn't quite rip-and-tear-y enough, what with it's clean slices and stabs. Conversely, the chainsaw has been much more heavily built into gameplay, to the point swinging it is a single button press and it automatically regenerates. Which is great, but given how often and quickly you're whipping out this big ol' engine... It's a bit cumbersome, from a purely visual standpoint.

Combining the two solves both 'problems': The armblade gets more focus and brutality, while the chainsaw gets a quicker and leaner design to match it's new place in the combat loop. 

Also, c'mon: Armblade chainsaw. Ash Williams meets the Predator. What's not to like?",1,1585496647,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr7tz1/the_nitpickiest_take_they_should_have_built_the/,Doom,1

fr7qxo,BobbyBudnicksDad,Platforming ruined Doom Eternal,"I was really excited for this game, having grown up on the originals and loved Doom 2016, but I have to say Eternal so far is a major step back and pretty lame so far. My main complaint is the platforming and level design. I find myself draining my health or wasting several lives on some stupid jump and dash to a climbing wall that isn’t fun in any way and doesn’t add to t game at all. Many times they designed the levels so shittily that I find myself looking at the walkthrough online just to get to the next battle area.

I enjoy the platform aspect of this game in the battle arenas, but these stupid in between jump and dash sections are absolutely pointless, poorly designed and add nothing to the game. Pretty irritating. Combine that with the more generic battle area style of the combat and the need to constantly harvest from enemies in this game, and I have to say I’m pretty damn disappointed. 2016 was vastly superior",27,1585496328,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr7qxo/platforming_ruined_doom_eternal/,Doom,1

fr6owu,mootmeep,"[spoilers] Complete lore recap as I understand it, feel free to ask any questions","Basic overview:


   * Sentinels (the space templars) were an ancient race of warrior dudes. They lived on a planet that had magical creatures called ""wraiths"". Wraiths had magic power and disappeared. The sentinel race ?somehow? extracted the wraith power from wherever and advanced their civlisation, whilst remaining knights templar.
   * The Makyr civilisation (which is supposedly in a dimension opposite to hell - i.e. hell is down, makyrs are up), found the sentinels, and said, ""yo, let us be your deity, because we're immortal (they're actually not but they lied), and you guys are just mortal humans, so yeah, we're gods, do what we say."" So the sentinels started worshiping the makyrs.
   * The makyrs used the sentinels as an army and used makyr tech mixed with sentinel tech to teleport to other worlds (using things like the doom fortress as orbiting bases around planets) to essential wage crusades and ""convert non-believers"" to the makyr religion.
   * So you have the sentinels under the control of the makyrs going around taking over planets to convert them to makyr ruled worlds. Why? I don't know, I guess the Makyrs just loved ruling worlds. They left one of the Makyr 'drones' on the conquered worlds usually to act as a icon/guide/consultant for the king or whatever.
   * At this point, thousands of years ago, doomguy from Doom 1, 2, and doom 64 gets teleported from the 2.5D MSDOS hell dimension, into the modern remake sentinel homeworld dimension because the demons of hell were sick of his shit and sick of him killing them constantly.
   * Sentinels put doomguy in the coliseum as a ""trial"", they get impressed by doomguy and put him in the front lines of their army to continue their crusades.
   * This goes on for a few years, maybe a decade or so. Doomguy impresses them by being doomguy.

    &gt;Who is the blue guy that looks like a Viking on the throne?

   * That's king novik, king of the sentinels. He's impressed with doomguy, makes him one of the ""Knight Sentinels"" special warriors of their race. This is a big deal, because no commoner can become a knight sentinel, doomguy is from another dimension and gets promoted, so, good for him.
   * Now, when doomguy teleported from the 2.5D MSDOS hell dimension, he let the demons know about the sentinel world. (I guess the demons from the MSDOS dimension are in contact with the demons from Windows 10 dimension). The demons follow doomguy through. Oh shit, demon invasion for the first time in the sentinel world, demons wipe the floor with the sentinels, and the Makyrs are like ""oh fuck, we don't know anything about hell or demons, and um, we are kinda shit and can't really help you"". Doomguy steps up and stops the invasion because he's doomguy.
   * But the leader of the Makyrs, the Khan maker, starts getting interested in the hell dimension and it's potential...
   * At this point, Hayden (who is part of the Makyr race) does some bullshit. He:

1. Steals the ""father"" (who is the downloaded consciousness of the creator of the Makyr race)  
2. Decides to power up doomguy and makes him immortal
3. Fucks off to earth and then Mars (apparently going on to do the events of doom 2016)

  *  The Khan Maker has now realised, ""that bastard Hayden stole the father, which means our Makyr society will be destroyed unless we get massive energy sources to keep it going... I know, I'll make a deal with the hell dimension to give them souls so long as we can take most of the 'soul energy' and send it back to my dimension so the Makyrs don't go extinct.""
   * Doomguy continues to battle hell and demons, but the 3 high priests of the sentinels, along with the Khan Makyr have made a deal with hell and betray doomguy and the knight sentinels. Also, they've convinced the majority of the population of the sentinels to just not give a fuck and be evil, or at least go along with their evil plans.
   * BTW this is all happening about 1,000 years ago or some shit. It's a long time ago.
   * Anyway the ""betrayer"" you meet in the game also made a deal with hell to get his son back, but that backfired - that doesn't really matter to the plot. Main point is, the knight sentinels were still good guys, but were betrayed by everyone.
   * They went on ""one final mission"" to get to the heart of hell and fuck everything up, but because they were betrayed, all the knight sentinels were separated and sent to different parts of hell or random locations they didn't expect and killed by demons.
   * Doomguy also got sent somewhere random, except he just kept killing demons.
   * Hell is like ""fuck, this guy just keeps killing us, uhhhh, let's seal him in a coffin or some shit"".
   * Meanwhile the sentinel race at the command of the makyrs basically gives hell all the worlds they previously conquered - all so the souls of those worlds can power the Makyr civilisation and stop it dying.
   * This goes on for ???? years
   * Then - we get the events of Doom 2016.
   * Then in between Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal we missed a game so we don't know what happens. From what I understand, a lot of retconning occurred and we don't speak about it.

______________________________________________________

Then we get to Doom Eternal:

   * Hell is invading earth following on from the fuckup on Mars (though apparently it took a few years for this to occcur ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
   * Doomguy is in the process of killing the 3 sentinel/hell priests to stop the hellification.
   * Doomguy kills the priests, but the Khan makyr wants that soul energy bad. She rebuilds the icon of sin (from 2.5D MSDOS land doom? From where exactly I have no idea, it makes no sense ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).
   * Doomguy kills the khan maker, puts VEGA (who is actually the consciousness of the father) back into a computer at Urdak because why not.
   * Then doomguy kills the icon of sin stopping the demonic invasion of earth.",4,1585492138,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr6owu/spoilers_complete_lore_recap_as_i_understand_it/,Doom,1

fr6neq,PlinyDaWelda,The Finest Shooter Ever But Very Poor Boss Fights,"Finishing up my second playthrough (both on NM) and the game is easily the most mechanically satisfying shooter ever.  There are, however, several niggling issues that make it less than it could have been.  

First there are things like certain slayer gates and buff totem arenas that feel so absurd they border on  unfair.  The entire final level on NM difficulty is just ridiculous with silly enemy comps like two titans, a marauder and multiple arachnatrons and Mancubi all in one large arena.  As with any game, everything is able to be beat but it doesn't mean it feels good doing it.  ANy encounter with a Marauder AND another heavy is cancer.

The biggest dissapointment for me though is the boss fights.  I understand what they were trying to do here.  They wanted to keep the frenetic movement and resource management as a part  of the boss fights, so instead of large enemies focusing on pattern recognition they turned the boss fights into set piece arenas. The problem is the entire purpose of boss fights is a change of pace that tests different things.  I happpen to think that 2016's boss fights were fanatastic.  I love every one of them. Once you learn them they can be beat without taking damage if you're good enough with the mechanics.

Eternal's boss fights are basically arena fights with a big target to occasionally chip away at.   Only the Doom Hunter feels like a good boss fight and even there the amount of adds takes away from what would otherwise feel more like an epic confrontation with one powerful enemy rather than a room of enemies with one dude who's a bit more beefy. 

In several of the fights there's so much insane chaos that actually focusing on the bosses attacks is simply impossible.  Icon of Sin?  I don't even know what he was doing.  I don't think I even saw half of his attacks because taking more than 2 seconds to focus on him is death.  Same with the Khan.  Managing adds is the boss fight more than fighting the boss.  And her attacks feel more like area denial things that just make the floor lava rather than patterns to learn and respond to.

I dont' think it's possible to do either of those fights without taking any damage (I'm sure one person somewhere will eventually do it but it's out of the reach of most people).  The dude with the shield is closer to what I would have prefered for a boss fight but even there his attacks come out in strange patterns and he turtles constantly which is literally the exact opposite of what I'm looking for in a doom enemy or boss.  Immunity phases is fine turtling is annoying and I don't feel like I actually learned his patterns as much as I moved constantly and refilled my health with adds.

TLDR.  If you simply ported 2016's bosses into eternal this would probably be one of the finest games ever made in any genre ever.  But these boss fights are subpar  in their design intention and execution.  I think the idea of making boss fights resemble regular arenas was a mistake.  Boss fights should feel mechanically distinct from the rest of the campaign not simply be an extension of them.",2,1585491957,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr6neq/the_finest_shooter_ever_but_very_poor_boss_fights/,Doom,1

fr6jba,MrMakaveli,Theory about Doomguy &amp; B.J. world,"Hey all

Before I start, I want to say that I am a big fan of both games and grew up in both games.

I even still play the original Doom with mods and still having a blast with it

I just finished DOOM Eternal and enjoyed it a lot, did 100% in the game (not including multiplayer) and enjoyed everything the game has to offer, can't wait for the DLCs missions + arcade mode update and....mods support I hope?

\-

I really liked Wolfenstein TNO+TOB but the last 2 games are very bad but for now, I'm trying to think where the story is going.

\-

and now the theory :) (sorry for kept you waiting huh?)

B.J and Doomguy are brothers or step-siblings or close relatives, they both joined the army and both fought against the Nazis, both were commanders and both split during the battle.

Doomguy finds they have invaded his city and he starts worrying about his rabbit Daisy, he decides to take some good soldiers and tries to get there as soon as possible, all his soldiers are killed in battle and only he remains. He starts to go crazy when he sees all his soldiers being killed, his amount of nerves reaches a level never seen before and after he runs out of ammunition, he goes for punches and manages to kill anyone who stands before him.

He arrives at his ruined house and sees the rabbit's cage with blood, not sure if this is the rabbit's blood but he doesn't know and this makes him even angrier. Suddenly a vehicle and tanks pass by and he hears that the mission has been completed here, the next stop is on Mars.

and who said that? I guess you guessed it already! the Icon of sin, next to him sits Olivia Pierce aka Spider Mastermind.

\-

Wolfenstein spoilers If you haven't played.

&gt;! in Wolfenstein, you discover that the Nazis have a huge base in space, and we should destroy it.!&lt;

Later Doomguy told the Army that he wants to join the UAC and fight the Nazi armies on Mars to kill the icon of sin but he falls to trap and we don't know how many years he was in the grave (doom 2016)

But something woke him up... or someone? could he has woken up in a parallel world?

&gt;!In the game Wolf youngblood, BJ tells his daughters about some other worlds, and even about parallel worlds someone of them is the Doomguy world, but he says it's Hitler's plan in case he dies so he wants to destroy the universe with him, maybe this is his plan with!&lt; Icon of Sin to release all demons and do the hell on earth thing and later the entire universe.

\-

I can't comment fully on the balance, but let's just say it's not bad. However one thing I can say for sure is that if 1 Demon teammate is bad, the other doesn't stand a chance if the Slayer is even decent. That's just the game mode, no problem there. The menus could use a LOT of work. I can't see my skins in the menu, the end screen disappears if anyone leaves after the match, and it's very hard to communicate with players. There's a lot of other tiny bugs which I'm sure they'll fix in good time.

I would also like some clarity on how the XP is calculated for the sets you get from the events tab. Do you need to play with said character for XP to be counted there? 

The game itself is great when everything works well. I'm hoping for more modes in the future, maybe a 2v4, 2v5 or something?",2,1585491176,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr6gx1/thoughts_on_battlemode/,Doom,1

fr617e,ReykjavikRed,Sorely disappointed in Doom Eternal,"After playing for a couple of hours and the first two missions, I'm ready to call it quits. I really liked the 2016 title, and I really wanted to like Eternal, but I just had to face the fact that it wasn't clicking for me at all. Maybe it would have eventually, but the initial impression was weak enough that I decided not to push Steam's refund policy limits too much.

The 2016 combat gameplay was a masterclass in sleek simplicity: the run&amp;gun, the glorykills, the chainsaw are a combination that works perfectly together. It's just complex enough to keep the game from becoming monotonous, but is easy to grasp and rewards fast-paced, aggressive gameplay. Eternal still has all that, kind of, but now there's bunch of clutter to get in the way: The flamethrower, the blood punch, dashing, monkey bars, etc. I'm half inclined to ignore all that, but somehow I have that annoying feeling that the game is expecting me not to, and I was still unlocking new mechanics. 

One thing that bothered was that I was constantly chainsawing/torching random zombies between arena encounters to replenish ammo and armor. 2016 was never stingy with ammo and health between battles, the chainsaw was a combat tool, not a farming implement. Most importantly, I can't imagine myself missing any of the new mechanics when replaying 2016, which to me makes them pretty pointless.

Then there is the level design. In 2016 many of the maps were multi-leveled and connected in interesting ways. The two maps I saw in Eternal felt more like a pipeline. In 2016 I was looking for secrets because exploring was fun, in Eternal I was stopping in my tracks to look for a punchable wall whenever there was big question mark visible behind some iron bars. The 2016 maps had some platforming, but it rarely felt excessive (well, maybe in Argent tower it did), and the scenery was interesting enough not to make it too annoying. Eternal seems to have just long stretches of either platforming or wading through purple slime. They feel like chores, and again, the platforming wasn't the part of 2016 that I thought needed expanding with wall climbing, monkey bars, dashing. They don't make it fun, they just make it a different kind of a chore.

Finally there's the story and the aesthetics. I loved the dark sci-fi trappings (the hell levels always seemed much less interesting to me(. The story fit 2016 perfectly, and I liked how it was understated and mostly for flavor. I liked that they kept both Hell and Doomslayer mysterious, and I thought the brief moments when they went into more details on either were the weakest aspects of 2016. I liked the influence of Hell being depicted as corruption, insanity and rage, not moustache twirling demon baddies.

Once again, Eternal seems to focus on all the wrong things of its predecessor. In the first 5 minutes there's moustache twirling demon baddie, which just immediately deflated the atmosphere for me. Soon after the game goes all in on the Night Sentinel lore, and now we've completely abandoned the dark sci-fi and gone full Asgard, and I just don't feel that MCU and Doom quite mesh thematically.

I get that a couple of hours isn't a lot, and maybe I'll pick this up on sale down the line and give it another shot, but right now I feel that the devs and I have a very different idea about what made the previous Doom great.",4,1585489187,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr617e/sorely_disappointed_in_doom_eternal/,Doom,1

fr4nph,worldssmartestpickle,(Unpopular opinion?) UN could be improved...,"Hey everyone,

Here's what I think could be improved in UN:

Having the player go through what is essentially a tutorial over and over is tedious to say the least. The first two levels are incredibly boring if you've just died at level 5 or even later. You're constantly switching back and forth between a fully equipped slayer and a naked one. It was already criticised in reviews that the game has troubles getting off the ground but having to do it 20 times in a row just makes me not want to try another run at all. Here's a suggestion:  
Make UN only unlock after beating the game on any difficulty. This way you can draw a clear line in the sand where you can say ""This is where the tutorial is over and the game starts."". A point like this could be Cultist Base. If the third level was the entry point to UN I literally wouldn't be able to stop playing because the game is so much fun. You have all your base abilities and a couple of weapon points to spend. It's really where the game lets you off the leash and challenges you. But currently everytime I think about trying UN I think about the first two levels and just play something else. I'd be completely fine with getting reckd all day if it would mean that I could just start over from a point where the game is actually fun.  
I want to be clear that I'm not saying this to make the game easier for me. I can finish the tutorial levels on pretty much autopilot without thinking about anything and that's exactly why it's so boring.  


Also the game itself needs some more polish imo. First there's enemies bugging out just standing around doing nothing (really helpful if that happens to bigger demons like mancubi or spectres). I've had this happen in almost every run at some point and I just leave that demon up because he will stop the next wave from triggering since he's a bigger one.  
Second enemies seem to be able to attack through walls on occasion. This happens especially often with imps, gargoyles, soldiers and those cybernetic soldiers with their flamethrowers. There's even a moment in Spudhunters recent UN run, [where a baron jumps on him through a wall](https://youtu.be/c-7t_iH3GDA?t=988). He got insanely lucky that this didn't end his run.  
These two bugs can either make or break an entire run and I think they should be fixable.  


Another thing I'm not quite on board with is the bloodpunch's aim assist. I'd rather have it be an ability that does damage in a cone in front of me regardless of wether a demon is there or not (so you could essentially waste it). This way you can let the player decide what to punch instead of having the game ""help"" you hit targets in front of you. This ability itself has ended like two or three of my runs because it pulled me to an enemy that I didn't intend. The ability is mostly useless on UN anyways though so it's not that big of an issue. Most of the enemy specific mechanics like punching (cyber)macubi or archviles is straight up suicide if they aren't frozen because they will just drop their aoe and melt you. In almost all cases it's safer to melt those from a distance.

Otherwise the mode is fun. If you can get past cultist base you're usually in for a treat because the game gets so much more engaging after that.",1,1585482180,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr4nph/unpopular_opinion_un_could_be_improved/,Doom,1

fr46vp,TBAAAGamer1,A summary of the entire journey doomguy has gone through as of eternal (Spoilers),"Doomguy's journey began when he beat his commanding officer to near-death and was sent to mars. From there he became trapped in a demonic invasion and was the sole survivor.
By sole survivor i mean he took a shotgun and blasted his way through the demonic forces, went to hell and back, killed the cyberdemon and then the spider mastermind, only to find his rabbit had been murdered.


Doom 2 rolls around and he's now single-handedly fighting off the forces of hell. it takes a lot out of him, but he finally wins and hell retreats.

By doom 64 doomguy hasn't been doing so great, having now murdered his way through two hell invasions, he suffers from incurable hell ptsd. the man is so out of sorts that when the government tells him that the mars base they nuked for years to ensure the demons couldn't come back may in fact, have demons in it and they need him to clear it out. For doomguy this is literally a return to a nightmare he's been trying to escape. Now haunted by his PTSD, he does the one thing nobody with that condition should do, he loads a shotgun and jumps right in. now fighting mutated variants of demons he's fought in the past, he's not in a good place, but he'll be damned if he's gonna let that stop him from suplexing hell's forces with the power of his guns and rage.
by the end of doom 64 he finds the mother demon responsible, kills it, and effectively decides that he'd rather go out fighting hell to keep them distracted from invading earth.


This immediately backfires when he's expelled from hell by another major demon that dies in the process.


As of this point, doomguy is now trapped in the sentinel homeworld, delirious from his injuries, and has been found and imprisoned by the sentinels who honestly don't know what to make of him, especially given that he's quoting all of the lines from the doom comic in his injury-fever.

thinking him a mere beast, they test him by way of the arena.

He proceeds to pass the test with flying colors, WHILE injured, filled with fury, grit, and worn out past his limit he's still more than capable of contending with the slaves of sentinel prime.


The khan makyr sets her minions to learning his language in order to better understand what he's repeatedly talking about. when she can finally understand him, he tells her about his experience with the demons of hell. the khan, not fully understanding the ramifications of what hell is and how dangerous it is to meddle with it, only sees another race of people in need of salvation and so she proceeds to seek hell out, leading to the first proper hell invasion of sentinel prime.


During this time the sentinels don't know what to make of their enemy, and doomguy, who they've dubbed ""the beast"" because of his feral nature, proceeds to do what they can't and rips and tears his way through the hordes while shouting ""Rip and tear"" they're so impressed by his ferocity, tenacity, and nobility that they then make this their catchphrase and the king personally knights doomguy, and so he begins his training under the sentinels.


The hell invasions get worse and worse, and doomguy gets progressively more and more tired of dealing with it. in spite of this, thanks to him the night sentinels hold their own until a titan comes forth.


it's at this point that doomguy, and the sentinels, are overmatched. not only can they not fight the titan, it basically turns the tides of battle. the seraphim known as samur makyr fixes that by hooking doomguy up to a ""divinity machine"" it gives him power....lots of power, godlike power. he then proceeds to kill the titan and the day is saved. he is now called the doomslayer and his ""rip and tear"" tagline is now more popular than ever, becoming a major part of sentinel culture. if you're not ripping and tearing, you're not a real man.
it's at this point that the doom slayer is basically made a warrior king, statues of him are erected and a suit of armor is made for him by an unnamed demon loyal to his cause.


After this some bad shit happens, it's discovered that khan makyr made sentinel slaves build factories in hell. the sentinels are divided, with the holy order clearly against the traditionalists.
despite this the traditionalists trust the holy order to help them as they send most, if not all of their major forces into hell to stop the factories.


they are then immediately betrayed.


most of the sentinels go out fighting in a blaze of glory, killing thousands upon thousands of demons before they're eventually slain.


the DOOMSLAYER on the other hand, turns this into the ultimate chance to overcome his PTSD, by BECOMING THEIR PTSD. for thousands upon thousands of years the doomslayer basically fucks hell's shit up harder than it's ever been fucked up, to the point where he even slew a second titan. the demons of hell, their numbers now drastically reduced, have a sudden major cultural shift. Now instead of thinking themselves superior, every sentence where they describe their superiority now ends with ""I'm more powerful than anyone- except the doom slayer.""
it gets to the point where he becomes their boogyman. demons tucking one another into bed at night literally checking their bed for him. reports of him jumping out of closets to tear their spines out before strangling their spouses with said spinal column. Satan was once throttled through his coffee cup because the doomslayer shot a portal into it and reached through it. at one point the doomslayer exploded out of a birthday cake, screaming and shooting at everything that moved. Nowhere in hell is safe, and no matter how they flee, he finds and mercilessly, violently kills them without exception. 


he is then baited, trapped and the demons toss him into a coffin, put as many thoughts and prayers over it as possible, and then burn a big angry-looking warning sign over it that says ""Unspeakably mega-bad shit contained within, do NOT open this.""

Samuel hayden then proceeds to open it hoping for an insurance policy against a potential hell invasion.


Shortly after this, olivia pierce flips her shit, flips a switch and destroys the mars base, unleashing hell in their first proper invasion in years.
they then find themselves trapped on mars with doomguy.
So after one of the single greatest literal comebacks in gaming history, doomguy mops the floor with the new cyberdemon, olivia pierce and the fourth era demon lord fuse and become the spider mastermind, and he kills that too.


Afterward, samuel hayden has a disagreement with the slayer and sends him to some place where the fortress of doom is located, he then readies it in time for a new invasion of earth. Now, primed and ready for a revenge a LONG time coming, doomguy proceeds to give sentinel tradition the middle finger and murders the three priests responsible, and lets urdak and the makyrs eat the consequences of their betrayal by unintentionally giving hell access to urdak. he then kills the revived icon of sin, and walks off into the sunset of a mostly devastated earth.


The entire plot of the new doom franchise is ultimately a story about how doomguy made the mistake of telling the makyrs about hell and him trying to fix something he's largely responsible for. he succeeds, and ends his journey by giving hell the selfsame incurable PTSD he once had in 64.",14,1585479586,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr46vp/a_summary_of_the_entire_journey_doomguy_has_gone/,Doom,1

fr3tky,Cruxin,"""Key"" for Rip and Tear pack?","OK, so, long story short, I got pulled into the series right after launch of DE. Bought 2016 the other day and loving it, planning to get DE soon.

Obviously, I've missed the boat on the preorder bonus. While trying to check if there was another way to get the pack after launch, I found a listing on G2A. It is described as ""**DOOM Eternal - Rip and Tear Pack (DLC) - Bethesda - Key""** and appears to be claiming to be just that - a key for the Rip and Tear preorder pack.

I would like to state upfront I understand how shady these sites can be and especially G2A, I'm just working on the principle assuming this is legit. I want to know if it would work assuming it is.

So, well, is this a real thing? Were the preorder packs handed out as keys or were they straight to account or what?

And if so, would this work? Would I register it to my Bethesda account on the site? Would I need to use it though the Bethesda launcher? Would it register to my account and work on either PC platform or something? Most importantly - **Is it likely to work with the Steam version of the game?** I have no idea how any of this works seeing I've never used Bethesda codes or even a Bethesda account.

Any info would be appreciated. Thanks.",6,1585477402,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr3tky/key_for_rip_and_tear_pack/,Doom,1

fr3r1g,Neuromante,Where did the Classic Doom community went?,"So, years ago there was here a small but healthy community devoted to classic Doom modding. There was some threads here and there talking about the latest cool stuff in Doom modding, and usually the big releases were covered here pretty quickly.

Then memes came, and all the hype with Eternal basically swooped any kind of conversation on the old games besides the ""Hey, I bought it for the switch"" and ""I've finished this or that map."" We went from some good conversation on modding to nothing in the span of over a year or so.

So, my question (if that people still reads this sub) is: where did everyone went? /r/doommods is half dead, as well as /r/oldschoolfps. Did everyone went to the gzdoom forums? Maybe some other subreddit I'm not aware of? I already follow Mr. Icarus and check out from time to time Realm667 (I hate they don't have an rss feed, though), but I'm kind of missing the aspect of being able to talk with more people about why Ashes 20636 is the best thing ever or why Eviternity rocks but leans too heavily towards arenas in the later stages.

fr2sqr,DrunkenGerbils,Eternal feels like a classic Doom game to me.,"I’m a thirty six year old dork who’s loved Doom since I was a little kid. The original Doom blew my little child mind and I still remember how absolutely cool playing Doom 1993 felt. It was a completely unique experience that instantly hooked me. Eternal is the perfect balance of nailing that original spirit of Doom’s gameplay while still delivering something fresh enough to make a thirty six year old man feel like he’s a ten year old boy who’s just discovering FPS games for the first time. ID really captured the feeling of the classic Doom games in a truly amazing fashion in my opinion. Eternal not only serves to strengthen my love for the original games, it makes me excited as hell for the future of the franchise. Which is the highest compliment I could give a new Doom game as far as I’m concerned.

fr14ad,the_best_skeleman,Eternal is great! But I do have some unpopular opinions to air out.,"I'm glad to say after beating the game for the first time I have *finally* gotten a handle on Eternal's combat. It only took the entire game for me to actually get a hold on all the stuff we have to juggle, but I mean I made it.

It's the elegant dance so many other have said it was. It's fancy, it's fun and it's chaotic, but it's perhaps a little too chaotic for me (and judging by *some* reviews, maybe for a few other folks as well).

2016 was brutally simple and easy to get a handle of. The learning curve was quite gentle but it still felt like you had some room for improvement. It may not as elegant as Eternal's combat, but 2016 is far better at making me feel like an unstoppable man that all of Hell fears while also providing a decent challenge. 

Eternal doesn't quite make me feel like the Doomslayer I was in 2016. Personally I don't really feel like the unstoppable and eternally pissed dump truck of a man that we hear about in the lore. The now very important extra gadgets, reduced ammo and more importantly the nerfed melee just kind of make me feel like a pissed off space marine rather than a brutal ""avenging angel"".

I feel the learning curve in Eternal may be a tad too steep. It's why we see all the negative reviews where people constantly complain about not having ammo or getting killed repeatedly by marauders or people comparing the difficulty to Dark Souls. If I'm going to be honest (and you can see this in my post history) I absolutely **hated** the mid-game. I felt like I was throwing myself at a brick wall repeatedly and hoping it collapsed. It didn't really feel Dark Souls hard, it felt more like a child making up the rules as they went sort of hard. Emphasis on **felt**, but the point still stands.

I would be okay with another Doom with this ""speed chess"" style, but honestly less is more and I feel like we're nearing the limit of complexity here. It kind of feels like a health and ammo management simulator with an FPS on top, if that frankly terrible metaphor makes any sense to you.

As for a gripe I still have and still cannot get over is the melee nerf. Man can punch through a concrete wall and punch a massive solid metal cube like it's nothing but can't even send a zombie into a stagger state. It just doesn't make that much sense really, and I feel it's a detriment to the otherwise pretty good combat.

And as a personal note to the devs (who will never see this post), **please** don't treat the BFG like it's just another weapon on the weapon wheel... I've wasted far too much BFG ammo from running out of other ammo mid-battle than I'm willing to admit.",26,1585462117,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr14ad/eternal_is_great_but_i_do_have_some_unpopular/,Doom,1

fr0x5c,Bladings,Doom 1 - Doom 2016 Timeline,"Heres a quick timelime.
-Doom 3 (doomguy is still a new marine and not used to killing demons.)
-Doom Resurrection of Evil (after proving himself worthy, he is sent once again to defeat the demon invasion.
-Doom 1 to Doom 64 is a direct continuation. (In Doom 64 he decides to stay in hell and fight the demons for eternity.)


After some time, he finds himself in Argent D'Nur. We do not know how, but my guess is that he found a couple of demons trying to invade the Argena realm and followed them there. Some Knight Sentinels later find him and take him to their priests. Doomguy is then sent as a gladiator to either prove himself worthy or die fighting. After defeating every single opponent, the priests and even the Khan Makyr herself see im him a valuable asset. Trough his very brief dialogue, Khan Makyr learns of the existence of the demon realm and their capabilities. 

During all of this, the Seraphim steals ""The Father"" (an intelligence/being responsible for the power and immortality of the Makyr race). At this time I do not know for sure if the Seraphim is indeed a Makyr, but I do hope that someone can tell me in the comments.

The Khan Makyr, wanting to preserve her race, makes a deal with the legions of hell. Demons are now allowed in Makyr worlds but will have to provide the Makyrs with argent energy. Demons use this to invade Argent D'nur and Doomguy is sent to fight them alongside the Knight Sentinels. He defeats every single demon with an unrelenting rage and hatred. 

During all of this, the Betrayer leads the armies of hell to the Elemental Wraiths, hoping to get his son back. (The Elemental Wraiths are implied to be 3 Makyrs that first discovered Argent D'nur). The demons transform them into ""The Well"", which is an infinite source of argent energy. They bring his son back, but transform him into the incon of sin.

Later on, the Seraphim grants God-like powers to doomguy. (I won't go in details, but the Seraphim obviously has a hidden goal). This is very interesting, as Doomguy and the Seraphim are  in fact enemies (he's on the side of the Makyrs). 

Argent D'nur as fallen and Doomguy, now known as the Doom Slayer decides to kill every single demon in this world. Argent energy corrupts many people of the Argenta world, incluiding the 3 priests. After fighting the demons for eons, Doom Slayer gets trapped and emprisonned in a cage that would contain him for eternity. 
*I'd like to mention that the betrayer, feeling remorseful, decided to help doomguy on his crusade and is in fact the one that made his armor.

After god knows how long, UAC  discovers a mysterious cage holding someone prisonner in hell. They bring it back on mars and open it. This triggers a demon invasion, and also awakens the mighty Slayer. This time, he is prepared. And he will *rip and tear*


This is where Doom 2016 starts.
There is a lot of stuff that I did not mention in this, but I hope to clear out some confusion.

fr0uxh,kalitarios,"Beat the game, then tried the MP mode, kinda mundane, IMO... any chance for DM/TDM/CTF/Rocket Arena mode?","Bought the full digital version as soon as I heard about it for Xbox One.  Spendy, but I love all things ID software going back to Doom and Quake days.

Beat the game on HMP then tried a few nightmare attempts... lots of fun in campaign... then I tried the Battlemode MP.

Meh.  After running through the tutorial, I tried jumping right in.  At 6pm EST I tried for about 15 minutes before I could get past the ""not enough players try later"" error message.  Finally got in, got smoked as the Slayer, not even joking shit is hectic off the rip.  Waaaay too much going on in a fast twitch pace.  But that's not necessarily bad, I just have no way of learning the maps solo, so diving feet first into it I'm a deer in headlights vs 2 archviles, I died in like 2 seconds every wave.  Wasn't really my cup of tea.

On top of that, I got taunted by the players and they quit out, so I decided to give it a few more tries before writing it off.

I gave it about 10 matches as ""quick play"" and I ended up the slayer 9 times out of 10.  It's really glitchy, especially against Marauders, they seem to have a way to double jump-dash and then freeze themselves in the air, sometimes up to 2 seconds that throws off your prediction for rockets, after they double jump, you should be able to put a rocket at their feet as they fall and they have to get hit.  But they almost seemed to be able to freeze mid air and screw up my prediction path.  Pain Elementals were waaay too easy to kill with homing rockets (2 salvos or 1 salvo and switch to MG and chip them down) and the fact that you can't skip intros into the match even when it's the same lineup is tedious.  If we all ready up, do we really need to see the same posedown every single time?

Anyway... was wondering if there will be a DM, TDM or CTF... even Rocket Arena mode coming out?  I can imagine a Quake 2 / Q3A style Capture the Flag, or Rocket Arena would be amazing in this engine.

Seems to be a good balance of hitscan vs spray vs splash weapons in the game, would love to know the potential that will come out of this!

fr0tz2,Thatniqqarylan,So about Haden and Vega... [Spoiler],"So, Samuel Hayden is Seriphim and Vega is The Father, correct?



1. Samuel has a weirdly intimate knowledge of the Mayker and Urdak lore. 


2. Seraphim is also known as ""Samur Maykr"" which is pretty damn close to Samuel.


3. Vega says Samuel's tech is remarkably similar to the maykr's as it is compatible with the Maykr tech of the ship.


4. Vega asks Samuel if he is The Father in the last chapter.


5. Seraphim stole the father and basically fucked off into space, whereabouts unknown. Maybe Samuel didn't invent Vega, he just stole him. 


6. Samuel has always had intimate knowledge of the slayer and his abilities. Could this be because he was the one who endowed him with the abilities?

Except the Ballista. It is not more powerful than the Gauss Cannon, and they made it slower. And if it's more powerful, it sure as hell has done a bad job at making itself feel like it.

I kinda prefer the look of the chaingun from 2016 but the one in Eternal is infinitely more useful with the shield it has. 

Also the praetor suit from 2016 is most certainly better than Eternal's one, you can't change my mind.

fr0d2e,carolinablues,[SPOILER] Boss Fight Trouble!!,"Hey all- I need some help! I'm experiencing an insane spike of difficulty on the Kahn Makyr boss fight. I've died 50+ times on this fight. I must be doing something wrong as I've read multiple articles online saying ""this is the easiest boss fight"". I would consider this 10x harder than anything yet in the game based on my experience so far, 10x harder than Marauders, so I must be doing something wrong.

I'm playing on Hurt Me Plenty. I've fully upgraded suit, ammo, armor and health.

Here's how my fights usually go- 
At the beginning of the fight, I snipe a couple Kahn Drones headshots to full-up health and ammo while dodging Makyr's attacks.
Then I start attacking Makryr with the (fully upgraded) Chaingun or (fully upgraded) Plasma Rifle while constantly moving to avoid her attacks.
When she glows green I use the Meathook/Punch to attack to finish the stage (1 of 6).

At this point she starts setting the ground on fire. By round 3, almost the entirety of the ground is lava, meaning i have very little room to move around safely.
I try to snipe the Kahn Drones for health/ammo to stay alive but the entire arena has ""lava ground"" and I can't move around enough to avoid everything or even grab the ammo/health that the Drones drop.

I've had over 60 attempts and never gotten past stage 4. I feel like I've been dominating this game until now, and everyone says this is the easiest boss. What am I missing? Thanks!",5,1585458503,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fr0d2e/spoiler_boss_fight_trouble/,Doom,1

So after undoing the idiotic things that Samuel did after 2016's DOOM, we last see the DoomSlayer off in his base, awaiting the next challenge. Is it just me, or is that sense of ""finality"" still not achieved after this latest entry? 

Vega is apparently booted off the ship (farewell mini-Jarvis), leaving Sam up there to do gosh knows what. What's more  is that we have big hints left over from the story that Sam is in fact Seraphim (the guy who originally gave the Doom Marine his powers).

Given that the Khan Makyr and her merry bunch of leaders have been dealt with, as well as the Icon of Sin, it seems that everything has been cleaned up well for our hero...maybe a little too well?

My point is: was this Sam/Seraphim's plan all along? To get the Khan Makyr and the forces of hell cleared away for the time being in order for a new party to take control? From what we saw of Sam at the end of 2016 (in his transformation to an almost antagonistic role) and now with the revelations in DOOM Eternal, is this all to set up Sam as the villain in DOOM 6?

Discuss.

fqzsxc,SovereignOne666,"So far, I prefer DOOM 2016's soundtrack. Will it get ""better""?","I'm watching walkthroughs and I'm currently at Taras Nabad (the mission where you first encounter an Archvile and the Divinity Machine that upgraded the Slayer; I think it's after you killed the Gladiator). The OST's definitely great so far, but it just doesn't make me cum like ""Flesh &amp; Metal"", ""Rip &amp; Tear"", ""Harbinger""/""Argent Combat"", ""Skullhacker"", ""Rust, Dust &amp; Guts"", ""Transistor Fist"", ""Hellwalker"" or ""BFG Division"" does (yeah I know that BFG Division's included in Eternal).

I dunno. Eternal's music sounds too industrial for me, too ""Blue Stahli""-esque (don't get me wrong, I love Blue Stahli. If you're a big fan of ""Slayer Gates"" (the Battlemode trailer theme) I can definitely recommend you cheching out ""Metamorphosis"" (instrumental version) by Blue Stahli, which might have inspired Slayer Gates). 

There's that one really djenty track, ""BFG 10,000"" - now that's more like what I'm talkin' about. Or that one track that un-fucking-fortunately didn't make the cut - that one &gt;260 BPM track you hear in the Super Gore Nest scene in the E3 gameplay presentation. According to Mick, it got removed bc it was ""too aggressive""; creating a too great tension in the player thus negatively influencing his strategic thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, wanted to ask wheter the music's after Taras Nabad is going to change in ""tone"" or if it will continue with the Slayer Gates party metal vibe.\*

fqzou0,stormygray1,observations about battle mod,"So, a few observations I've noticed about battle mode... first off the the mancubus is a total noob trap. I've seen many people think that playing the mancubus means you can just mindlessly Wm1 the slayer and get completely chewn up and spat out in literally seconds. that is not how you play mancubus effectively. second, for a demon labeled as a, ""defensive power house"" in the campaign, the marauder is possibly the most aggressive demon in battle mode. I don't mind, but I do think it's rather funny. I think the pain elemental has some of the best summons and is extremely under-rated. (funnily enough, his summons are even better than the archviles imo) one really funny tactic unique to them to mess with slayers is to body block them when they fire off the man-cannon. 

you completely kill their momentum and confuse the hell out of them. plus with the shield you can be pretty much completely safe if they try and hit you for it. also I was completely unaware until today that every demon actually has 2 different action sets! so here's a PSA to all the demons, especially you mancubus. his default summons are genuinely terrible. makyr drones and cacodemons? you may aswell join the slayers team because your filling the level with ammo and health pinnatas, and all you get for it is a hazard volume. sure you can wombo combo with haz plus flame thrower occasionally, but I don't think it's worth having summons that are potentially detrimental...",0,1585455504,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqzou0/observations_about_battle_mod/,Doom,1

fqzlmv,TazDingus,Doom Eternal DLC wishes,"So I've gone through the campaign 3 times now give or take and I am of course hungry for more! What are YOUR personal wishes for the upcoming 2 story-DLCs? Do you want them to continue where Eternal campaign stopped? Set-up a proper third game? Do you want them to be prequels? What kind of enemies / bosses do you want? New gameplay mechanics? Weapons? What amount of levels should be satisfactory for you? Do you want more&gt;!Doomguy speaking in the cutscenes?!&lt;

GENERAL CONCEPT:

As for me personally, I think 4 levels per DLC is a good number to start (1 or 2 with the boss at the end). I am interested both in the prequel (Doomguy's time with the sentinels, unholy crusade and all that, what happened inbetween D2016 and Eternal) and the sequel approach (For instance, I would like the Vaelen plotline given some closure, maybe hunting down the generals of the Dark One - who could be the big bad for the third entry).

ENEMIES:  
As for the enemies I would REALLY like for chaingunner to return as a superheavy or heavy demon. Yes, I know, he was that infamous hitscanning asshole, but I'm sure id can make it work. For instance, you can see his laser aimer locking onto you and then he unleashes a volley of bullets but during that he's slow to turn so you can outrun it. It can work to get you out of some spots and generally as area-denial tool. He can have grenades and what not as a back-up attack. Having him back would mark the return of ALL classics from D2.  
Next up, maybe some cyber-marauders but with different gameplay loop? No shield, but armor and railguns? Or agile and acrobatic, somersaulting and wallrunning all over the place?  
Just a personal thingie, but I'd like the return of pink barons - purely as a visual flavor, or maybe the OG pink barons (same species as the gladiator) in the role of super heavies.  
The from Urdak we can have those creepy angels with spears whom we see in cutscenes but never get to fight in the main game.  
 As for the bosses - well, anything goes. Make some crazy demon generals, I think I saw a couple of good concepts in the artbook.   


LEVELS:  
More Urdak, More Hell (!!!) and maybe post-crisis Earth too? As long as it is visually stunning and fun to play!

WEAPONS:  
Now, of course it is not necessary to add new weapons. But if they did, they could replace some of our arsenal for the dlc, so we can shake things up a bit. We have a pistol already. What if it was akimbo burst fire pistols? I would dig that. Also I would really like for the crucible to be used more, maybe even a crucible-only bossfight, where you have to parry, and hit at the correct time.

STORY:  
In general, I would like to see Doomguy interact more with people cause usually it's hilarious. Maybe &gt;!even speak to them a couple of times.!&lt;Also Hayden is up to smth, and he has full control of our ship's mainframe, so let's see where THAT goes...

I swear to god I just played match with a guy from Nigeria and from United States.

Same goes with 2016 multiplayer, the little matches that didn't have hackers were unplayable with the lag. 

That's not the only problem, because of my lag, I sometimes clip through the ground and fall making me unkillable, rendering the whole match unfair and not fun for both parts.

Then we get to the final level and oh my dear god, I don't know what happened.

First of all, up until this point, this game has been super polished. Now in the final level, I've had SEVERAL bugs, never experienced before. Runes straight up not working (slo-mo on RMB in-air), falling through the world (through the literal ground), enemies glitching into walls, enemies spawning directly on my character, respawning at a checkpoint and having the enemies from a further up engadgement still firing at me (WARNING ROCKETS!!), dash all of sudden not auto-grabbing climbable walls (I have to hit E now, which you never had to do before), but if you press it too much he lets go instantly.

On top of that, design-wise,  the platforming in the final level is awful, everything feels super janky and unwieldy, despite me having no issues with previous levels.

It just feels like this last level, and even the one before were a bit undercooked. Really disappointing, because up until now this was my GOTY and this final level makes me just not want to play. I'll power through it now just to say I finished it, but damn.",5,1585454027,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqzc4b/spoiler_i_love_eternal_but_the_final_level_is/,Doom,1

fqysej,DragonzzillaPrime,"Having beat the final boss, I am incredibly disappointed...","... that we didn't use the mech in the Fortress of Doom to fight the Icon of Sin in a 1v1 worthy of Pacific Rim. Honestly, how can the game show so many mechs and we don't get to use one? Especially when we have one in the basement that's clearly being worked on?

Instead of reiterating that the IOS will grow stronger blablabla (seriously, did he need to repeat it 3 times?), Hayden says instead, ""I scanned the Icon of Sin, and its armor is impervious to conventional weapons. You're going to need something bigger to crack the shell. Fortunately, you already have the means to do so. I'm making the final touches as we speak; it'll be ready for you once you escape Urdak."" And coming to the Fortress of Doom, Hayden says something about ""ARC built several mechs, but Sentinel engineering surpasses our own. Your mech awaits."" You hop inside, and instead of teleporting you, Hayden calculates the IOS's position and launches the mech from orbit, which you get to watch in first person as you hurtle through the atmosphere toward the heart of a giant demonic pentagram, you see the destroyed landscape, and then you crash next to the IOS. You lock eyes... then you plug the Crucible in, and your mech summons a giant Crucible blade of its own--and the first phase of the IOS fight is instead an intense 1v1 swordfight with the Icon as you hack away at its armor, and once you crack the armor, it disables the mech, forcing you to eject and finish the fight on foot. Phase 2 proceeds as normal.

fqxkz0,ferpari,"The Final boss is way too spongy, and that clashes with the mechanics of the game (Spoilers)","So today I finished Doom eternal, and while I absolute loved it, the final boss was a dissapointment. The boss felt extremely tanky (I was playing in ultra violence), to the point in which breaking one part of his armor or body took more than two full reloads of the minigun.

Now, that is not bad by itself, but if you put it together with the fact that they have greatly decreased ammo capacity compare to the 2016 one, it resulted on my having to round around the arena for several minutes, just trying to find cannon fodder to chainsaw (and this is particularly difficult) in this level because they are just not that many, and the Icon kills the fodder periodically.

It felt completely anti climatic to spend more than half the fight just running around trying to find someone to chainsaw. The system worked well in the rest of the game because you were playing in bigger arenas and with less spongy enemies, so moving around killing while replenishing ammo felt great. It also didnt help the fact that you cant really use half of your arsenal, as the Icon is way too far away to use the shotgun, and the  rocket launcher seems to not do that much damage, leaving you mainly with the gatling, and the plasma rifle when it ran out of ammo (Sure, you have BFG ammo in the arena, but is still not enough, and if you miss one of those, which happens more than you would thing due to the fact that you have to hit a part of the body which is surprisingly small and the boss moves quite a lot, you just get incredibly punished for it).

This is particularly noteworthy because the previous boss was much more balanced in my view, with multiple stages but each one quite short, which prevented you from running out of ammo constantly.

fqx4i2,Skodanator,"The Marauder was fun, I don't understand the backlash","Let's preface this first, I played the entire campaign basically 95% blind and on **Nightmare** entirely. Obviously he (The Marauder) was hard, especially when accompanied by some heavy demons, but he was never INFURIATING, like I've seen so many posts on every website. He took getting used to, and he required your full attention, but that was literally his entire design. The **ONLY** thing I would change about him would be the dog. That's literally it. I think the rest of him was fine, and whenever he showed up, it was tense, and made me lean closer to my monitor and made me focus. After the boss fight with him, I pretty much knew how to deal with him, so after that, I died maybe a MAX of 8 times in any given encounter when he was around. I never cheesed him either, I didn't ever really think to do that, nor did I have the keybinds to set that up. All I had to do was learn his moveset and adapt my playstyle whenever he was on the map.

**tl;dr**
The Marauder was not unfair, he just required your attention (which was the intention). After learning his moveset, which was laid out to you by the game, you should have been easily able to adapt when he was around, even on Nightmare, which was what I played on for the entire campaign.",20,1585445241,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqx4i2/the_marauder_was_fun_i_dont_understand_the/,Doom,4

Does anyone know how to fix this and get the game running properly with vsync on, freesync on and no frame drops/stutters?

My system:

* 144hz freesync monitor
* i7 9700K
* RX 5700 XT
* 16GB 3200Mhz RAM

How am I meant to advance towards them when they spam their long range attacks, especially when there's 2 or 3? I know you can jump over them, but then what? Their 3 hit combo is longer than you can stay in the air unless you dash, which means I am not touching the control stick for a few seconds. Even then, it's not going to keep me in the air for all 3. This becomes a bigger issue when multiple whiplashes with offset attacks. 

So I spend time not aiming, then fall on the attack and get sent flying all the way back. I don't even know how to recover if you get hit by the first hit. It seems the knockback is longer than the speed of the combo. I don't see this working like the mancubus where you have to falter to get close or you'll get instant knockback simply because the whiplash's attack is extremely long range. It would mean you're not allowed to get closer than a giant radius around the whiplash unless you get a falter.

Additionally the #1 strat for dealing with this guy is to TRY to cheese him with two guns that you can easily just not have ammo for IF you can even get the stun on him. Thanks for making Doom something I have to take stress breaks from cause it can literally just be that broken mess sometimes. Playing on UN and N. This isn't the only thing contributing to that, getting cought on stupid floor geometry and having literally invisible enimies (not spectres, enimies whose models just aren't rendered I can attack them, them me I can ice and light them on fire to see them but that it, fun times!) also suck.

The left-sided one where he flys around out of control after slicing his torso and blows up has a way bigger explosion when he dies.  


Another is Doom Hunter's frontal kill. All his other perspectives are so much more brutal compared to wacking the doom-blade on his head twice and quietly watching him ragdoll immediately.

fqupf1,Matseye1r,Tips for those pesky Marauders,"Obvious spoilers and shit.

There are 4/5 noticable mini megabosses called Marauders who do and will consume your 1ups.

I've found some nifty tricks to beat these poorly implemented pace stoppers.

1. Use the following; Ballista + Super Shotty switcheroo (powering up the ballista is hit or miss but essentially it is at base a long range SS round. Paired with slow time and the fire hook makes these bastards bareable).

2. Backwards straifing ( works best if you can put a chest height object between you two. Long  square corridors are also good as you corner clip them (getting them snagged on a corner, this forces them to do their dash attack which is easily countered as you can see their green eyes light up) essentially you always wonna be moving away and to the side of him keeping him in frame as long as possible).

3. Grunts are infinitly spawning so only use them for up/armour and ammo otherwise ignore them completely, a soon as you encounter this bastard kill the non-respawnables, so everything that ain't imps an harassers.

4. BFG - just don't, these fuckers break lore by simply tanking your shots and getting one to hit is a trickshot that is pointless. I mean it's like doing a 360 noscope headshot on cos but the guy doesn't die so you'd have to pull another shot straight after, so a 720 double noscope headshot. Just save your BFG ammo and your crucible ammo (you'd think that would also work but nope they are immune to melee, and I haven't tried berserk or other power ups o them which would include using cheats due to the rareity of these powerups).

5. Prepare to die. Resign yourself to failure until you find a rythem that finally works for you.

Bonus point. Good luck slayers. Rip and tear.

Feel free to add any other tips. For me these work best and I've found using a weapon such as the plasma cannon, standard heavy rifle, minigun doesn't do enough dps in the small timeframe to be worth using those weaponry however they can cause stagger outside of their programmed green-eyed but I dunno if this is a bug or intentional. Th combat shotgun is a suitable replacement for the SS, throwables and such are pointless too. A well timed barrel explosive does work but that's luck based so not really worth it.",2,1585436526,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqupf1/tips_for_those_pesky_marauders/,Doom,2

fqum8j,arxero,[Spoilers] Criticism of the final boss.,"I should preface this by saying that I loved the game as a whole and had a great time, but I need to comment on the Icon of Sin fight.

Honestly? Underwhelming. And I include the final level design in that as well. The level was uninspired buildings with convenient portals and crossings. It’s laughable to think that the Slayer could catch up to that massive demon when it could easily just romp around the world as fast as it was (it straight up walks away from the first stage like it’s nothing). The level is basically the assets of ARC Complex leading to the boss fight.

As far as the actual fight? It’s just two stages of the same thing each time. Destroy 8 things then do it again. It feels very underwhelming given the buildup the game has. All other demons are essentially fodder demons now that you have the Crucible, they dont add much of a challenge except when they bodyblock you. I really thought there would at least be a third stage where you fought only the head and shit got real nuts but no. 

Within the world building and established lore of the game the entire fight isn’t.....convincing. The codex describes the IOS as tearing apart dimensions and wrecking all sorts of havoc on space time, but it decides to just chill on two skyscrapers and let a comparatively little dude blast the shit outta him while doing 1 of 6 different attacks. There’s no reason why the Icon couldn’t reach into the arena and toss the Slayer around the entire city like a tennis ball. There should’ve been something gained from destroying the Kahn Maykr that prevented the IOS from touching the Slayer, or something, idk.

But from a game development standpoint I kind of get it, the scale of the IOS makes it tough to design a fight around. You’d need a vivid imagination, a crazy amount of design, and lots of previously unused mechanics to make the fight what it should be.

Still, I don’t think it’s wrong to have expected something more than what we got. The game tells you, the player, that you’re a god among men and the IOS is a monster of immeasurable power. Hayden hypes the battle up himself (“two titans meet, as it is written”).

When I learned 2/3 through the game that the IOS is the final boss, I expected something grander, something akin to Shadow of the Colossus, or at least making use of the Mech we were teased with throughout the campaign. Seriously, how did the devs not see that they were leading us on with the way they introduced the three mech mechanics (Hand Laser, Torso Cannon, Lance) in the second mission and THEN revealing that WE HAVE one of the mechs in the Fortress. I expected the IOS to be taken down by using every mechanic we learned in the game. Meat Hook to him, use the climbing surfaces and dashes to really fuck him up, chainsaw shit off his body for ammo, something like that.",2,1585436224,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqum8j/spoilers_criticism_of_the_final_boss/,Doom,2

fqudf3,kacpertakasaki,Doom Eternal - Steam or Bethesda Launcher?,"Hello everyone!  
I plan to buy Doom Eternal soon. I do however have a dilemma which platform is better.  
Steam is my preferred one, because most the games I own are here. As for Bethesda Launcher the only game I have on it is Rage 2 an never had any problems with the launcher itself. Another thing that encourages be to pick Bethesda Launcher are the prices, especially in my local game stores, where I could save around $15, comparing to Steam version. Also there are dozens of keys for Bethesda Launcher, but almost zero for Steam, except for some that in my region would require VPN to activate.  
I'd love to hear your opinions here, maybe it will help me a lot :)",2,1585435378,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqudf3/doom_eternal_steam_or_bethesda_launcher/,Doom,1

fqu7g7,IamJuras,"Icon of Sin, what the *hehe* hell is wrong with your story? (SPOILERS)","Okay, I have been studying the history and plot of Doom series, and found some... inaccuracy? Here's what I noticed.

Story of Doom 2 takes place in 2022, in the end of it Doom Marine kills Icon of Sin. Then kills it again in TNT: Evolution. And again in Plutonia Experiment. And that's okay, I mean it's a titan, he can be resurrected or something, right (in Eternal Hayden says, that if Slayer pulls out the Crucible, the titan will wake up)?

Then in the end of Doom 64 (which is canonical) Doom Marine decides to stay in hell to fight demons to his last breath.

Aaaand quick jump to Doom Eternal story, where ""Ligra Sultangenta"" describes how Doom Slayer was found nearly dead, then fights with demons side by side Sentinels. This would mean, that Icon of Sin was killed by Doom Marine years ago, years before Argents know about hell, demons or any of these. Samur gives Doom Marine the power of Maykr, making him Doom Slayer, then runs to Earth, and uses argent energy to end Earth's energy ciris as Samuel Hayden, human scientist, who put his brain into robot.

But then the story says, that Velen, the Betrayer agreed to help Deags get rid of Sentinels, if they resurrect his son. Instead Deags use his son to \*create\* Icon of Sin. They create Icon of Sin years after Doom Marine killed it three times.

Then Sentinels are overrun in hell, all of them die, Doom Slayer is beeing held as a treasure, alive in his tomb. Jumping to Doom 2016, in year 2149 Samuel Hayden (aka Maykr Samur) finds Slayer in hell, wakes him up, you know the story. Problem is, between putting Slayer to sleep by Icon of Sin (or whoever ruled the hell) and Slayer coming back to hell in Doom 2016 I think nobody was powerful enough to kill Icon of Sin, but still we can see his dead body in hell... And after that Khan Maykr resurected it again?

Sooooo Doom Guy killed it in 2022 three times, then came to Argent D'Nur and told them about demons, after that Deags created Icon of Sin, who held Slayer captive for around 100 years, then... was killed by somebody? Died of old age? And then in Eternal, it was resurected again? My guess is, Doom Marine killed Icon of Sin for good in Plutonia Experiment, and Deags used Velen's son yeeeeears later to RESURECT Icon of Sin in Eternal. This way it would still be dead in Doom 2016, and alive in Eternal.

What do you think about it?",13,1585434814,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqu7g7/icon_of_sin_what_the_hehe_hell_is_wrong_with_your/,Doom,2

fqu6f9,Matseye1r,I would like to talk Lore (Doomguy),"In a flurry of vids on YT, after completing my first run of Doom Eternal, this has as most things do makes me wonna talk about shit and express my views and thoughts.

Rewatching screw attacks doom vs master Chief is hilariously bad, and watching other tubes on lore and such kinda get me thinking.

Anyway here's what I think I know; Spoilers potentially.

A marine who was ordered to kill fellow men was sentenced to a suicide mission to Mars (I think this was around the birth or time before Samual Hayden's current form.

Opening a gate to hell unspeakable horrors clasped and choked the Marine as the last surviving member of his squad, managing to survive he ripped and tore his way through the demon army, powered by anger time moving differently he was made stronger reforging his body in the flames of hell he became a beacon of human perfected determination, perseverance, and ingenuity. This rage powered him to close the gate on Mars, somehow breaching into another world called Argent D'nur with blood curdling ramblings about the impending doom that he'll awaits.

Rising to the rank of sentinal Knight, and possibly king, he was purified by the divinity project (I think this simply made him a pure human, solidifying his rage into his very cells, making him incorruptible (I don think this turned him into a god outright, I mean he was pretty godlike before, and not much changed after, so I think it simply made him pure human. I know the maykers were using for to find the prophesized destroyer, and what it does is simply purify whatever is inside the chamber i.e. 75% gold ore becomes 100% gold as 25% of impurities are eliminated, so in terms of humans and such I think it would serve as a limit breaker, to someone like me o you it would mean that we could do the whole ""reacuea child from under a car' feat but on demand and without breaking our bodies by doing so. but for him I think it made him immortal if he'll didn't already do that.i don't think it made him into what he was or would become, I think it just solidified what he already was and could be.)

During a mission through hell he was betrayed and being who he is he served to fight what he'll threw at him, indefinitely, instilled by the rage, honour of two peoples and fighting for humanity, hell struggled fearing his very name they employed to simply slow him down, and a trap was set and worked.

We return to our world which time progressed possibly 1000 or 100 years, but for hell, it would be even longer.

And so he is woken from his slumber to see that he'll was being used by us which in fact was a double ploy for hell to corrupt humanity. Doomguy knows what's up and sets about closing the gates to hell aided by Vega and Hayden.

A timeskip and armed with a flying fortress. He sets about killing those false gods who serve hell the Kahn Mayker and Deags.

Consoled by being the hope of two peoples, the humans he came from and the Argenta he was found by.

Killing his way through hell, heaven and earths his mission would be complete (for now).

Essentially this is my way of explaining in and out of detail how and why doom marine from classic is one and the same as soon Slayer from both 16 and 20.

Perhaps the betrayed is the original doom marine not born of Earth but Argenta and serves as a mirror to the Slayer. What he would become if he lost his rage.

I am of two camps when it comes to lore and such, I love that Yoda is an unknown species, I love that Doomguy is a bunny loving demon hating ragefest. But with each nugget of lore that serves to build upon these 'characters' I can't help but thread needles in hopes of learning more and subsequently being enveloped in more of a dom I hold dear.

In any case Doom is fucking awesome and as one of the first games I ever played, I know I'll still be playing before my time comes to an end.

fqu6a5,Son-Stevkan,Anyone else hate MP?,"I have many complaints about the multiplayer.
I get the game JUST came out and a lot of this will be fixed but STILL it’s like noone at ID play tested this shit.

1. The Doom Slayer’s weapons do shit damage... even if you posses the godly aim needed to track TWO player demons jumping around and running from you AND ten billion AI demons charging you, you simply do not do enough damage to make a difference with any weapons except the Rocket Launcher and duper shotgun. 

2. The Rocket launcher is ridiculously overpowered. I’ve been in at least 50 matches now and the RARE times when the Slayer wins its because they spam rockets on the ground at your feet and spam the burst lock on mod.

3. The Demon resurrection mechanic is stupid. What the hell am I supposed to do when I FINALLY manage to kill one of the player demons and the other guy just runs from me for 20 seconds? Seriously what the hell? I’ve lost so many matches to player demons who just run away until their partner resurrects and rinse and repeat until they whittle my health down.

4. The Marauder is broken. By FAR the most common player demon i’ve met is the Marauder. The main tactic is spam shotgun at close range and glue yourself to the slayers ass. Using best friend and tactician also makes the wolf super OP making this even worse to fight. 

5. WAY too many AI demons... it may just be me but I feel they should tone back the AI support demons in battlemode... they do way too much damage and box you in so the player demons can squish you easily. 

6. Blocking loot is dumb, what is the point in chainsawing if damn near every time I chainsaw to get ammo or health the player demons block my loot so I cannot get anything? I understand the concept and I don’t hate the idea of it I just hate how often it can be spammed. 


If i’m wrong about this stuff then by all means tell me, but I have had over 50 Matches now and I have only won as the slayer 1 time, and only lost as a demon twice, mind you the vast majority of these matches I played as a demon because I grew to absolutely loathe playing the slayer.

fqu386,jerichoneric,"As a huge fan of DOOM 2016, I think I'm gonna return Eternal","I'm gonna be totally honest. I'm not an FPS gamer. My top 10 list of games is basically all RPGs, a sandbox, and AoE2. DOOM 2016 somehow still makes it well into the top 15 maybe just outside at number 11, but Eternal... I really don't like. While 2016 did push me to get better, take risks, learn the movement, know my enemies, and more. Eternal has already ripped away the fantasy that I had so much enjoyed from 2016. I was originally playing on the normal equivilant difficulty as that is what I was playing on 2016, but despite having been playing the game only a few weeks ago I was getting killed left and right. I had no ammo, melee is garbage, and I end up having to waste the chainsaw on grunts. Only a few minutes into the game and I'm seeing it has a completely different mentality to 2016.


In 2016 doom you are eased in honestly. The game does ramp up pretty fast, but it gives you options about as quickly. If you are an explorer then you also get more options. This I think is the key. Doom 2016 was masterful at giving players options so they could have a satisfying time ripping and tearing through the hordes of hell. My exploring unlocked the super shotgun early and from there I knew the game was built with players like me in mind. It gave me more tools to use without inherently removing difficulty. I still had to be good with those guns to make use of them.

I steadily moved through the game getting better and eventually being able to play through at what felt like a satisfying pace. I was at the level the game seemed to want me at. I had a wonderful time with that game. I loved it.


But eternal.... Eternal took those options, and made them requirements. The chainsaw is not a satisfying reward for having fuel left for the big bads and its not a safety net if you screw up and get in over your head. It's an ammo pack that kills a low level enemy. The removal of the pistol and the nerf to ammo leave the whole thing feel like I'm the one on the back foot. Like I'm the one who should be afraid. Level freaking one and I'm finding myself out of ammo with no alternatives. Part of it is not just using the chainsaw at random on normal enemies, but it's not an enjoyable mechanic. Being able to two hit melee a zombie was an enjoyable mechanic now you can't even kill them in 10.


The game went from an ultimate slaughterfest fantasy to a  ""git gud or nothing"" game and I'm terribly dissapointed by it. 2016 I had to get good. I had to learn and master, but they gave me tools and options. This game says screw your tools and options if you don't constantly use everything you're doing it wrong.


For people who mainly play FPS I see why this is fun because it's pushing even harder than 2016 and you want to use every gun and every option all at once to win. For me it took what I liked about 2016 and buried it under a backwards mindset.


Also its a tiny nitpick but the theming also feels way weaker. Finding the weapons with soldiers who used them and keycards dangling off zombies and all the set dressing of 2016 was way cooler than everything just being a floating neon pick up.


Maybe it gets better. I'm still milling this all over, but more than likely DOOM eternal isn't a game for me, despite how much I loved DOOM 2016.",20,1585434445,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqu386/as_a_huge_fan_of_doom_2016_i_think_im_gonna/,Doom,1

fqt80o,Emangameplay,[POSSIBLE BUG REPORT] DoomHunter Boss Fight Glory Kill is (Possibly) Bugged,"   
This is a minor issue with the Doom Hunters boss fight. I tested it from multiple angles just to be sure, but during the glory-kill animation for the Doom Hunters in the Doom Hunter Base, they only have one animation, regardless of the angle you approach. Approaching from above or from behind will still give you the same one.   


Video Evidence Here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgftrSI1ISg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgftrSI1ISg) 

Timestamps for each kill are 3:31 (From the Front), 4:21 (From Behind), and 6:10 (From the Left). This same bug is not replicated in any other instance the Doom Hunters appear later on in the game. If this is in fact a bug, I hope this has been informative for possibly fixing it.   


I also posted this directly to the Bethesda support forum: [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/395168/bug-report-doomhunter-boss-fight-glory-kill-is-bugged?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/395168/bug-report-doomhunter-boss-fight-glory-kill-is-bugged?language%5B%5D=en)",1,1585431672,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqt80o/possible_bug_report_doomhunter_boss_fight_glory/,Doom,2

fqsyhh,The-Infernal-Angel,Why isn’t Eternal clicking for me?,"This is pretty much my last ditch effort to give this game a chance before I give up on it for a long time, possibly forever.  I of course played Doom 2016, it was fun, punchy, and the gimmicks could be taken advantage or or ignored for a simpler experience, fun either way.

So why is Eternal kicking my ass?

First off, does anyone know a fix for the HUD?  The HUD in this game is so shitty.  What is with developers/publishers (I don’t care who’s responsible) thinking that making your ammo counter smaller is helpful???  They added so many new abilities and I can’t see when any of them are charged or how much ammo I have left cause it’s all in teeny weeny eye-strain-o’-vision as the corners of the screen, and maybe my peripheral vision has faded in my elderly mid-20’s, but I remember D2016’s ammo count being a bright blue bar with a giant font for the ammo count that I could see in a quarter second glance.

Second, melee damage.  Oh my god, what happened to melee damage?  More to the point, why was the point of cutting off enough of Slayer’s armor to show off his skull crushing biceps, and then making his punches too weak to literally even bruise (let alone kill) the weakest enemies in the game?!  The DOOM SLAYER should not be losing arm wrestling matches to basic grunts!  What’s that?  “Use the Blood Punch” I hear you say?  Well, that’s sounds great. Someone remember to scream in my ear when it’s ready because I still can’t see the HUD in the middle of the action, remember?

Third, ammo count.  Yeah you all knew this was coming.  Okay, I’m just going to use the shotgun for my case in point.

2016 Shotgun standard ammo count: 20 shells.  Ammo upgrade: 10 shells.  Maximum shells: 60.

Eternal Shotgun standard ammo count: 16 shells.  Ammo upgrade: 2 shells.  Max count: 24.

I know the chainsaw dispense ammo, but what do I do when I’m out of ammo, out of gasoline, and my blood punch isn’t charged?  WHAT?!  TELL ME!  The whole point of being the DOOM SLAYER is to feel like an unstoppable badass, or so that post saying “don’t feel bad for playing on easy” told me.  Grenades aren’t going to kill enough for me to get a blood punch I don’t think, and even so I forget I have them half the time, and I still haven’t found a binding for switch grenades that’s not horribly awkward.

Third (this’ll be a long ramble one), is that my number one fear with this game’s release was that they were going to break all sense of balance by adding on more gimmicks than needed, and shoehorning in ways to force you to use them.  Super melee attack?  Well then standard melee has to be nerfed into the ground.  Freeze grenades?  Some enemies have to be next to impossible to hit with any weapon to force you to freeze them whenever possible.  More ways to get weapons and armor?  Enemies have to have “weak points” to compensate, and by “weak points” I mean “additional weaponry that will punish you hard if it’s not the first thing you pay attention to, leaving you open to everything else on the map, and GODS HELP YOU IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT SLOW MOTION RUNE”.  Look, that part I can accept as a “git good” part of the game; much like parrying in Dark Souls you don’t need to master it but if you don’t have the general idea you’re going to regret it eventually.  Blood Punch the mancubus though?  After everything I just said I want to give up and cry learning that one.

I’m not saying I want the game to be EASY.  I just feel as though every time something good was added to make the game more fun they felt the need to do something else to avoid you being too overpowered as a walking arsenal, and as a result I feel like they did they exact OPPOSITE.  I don’t want to have a shoulder mounted flamethrower bound to the key that’s usually for reloading.  I keep using it accidentally when I run out of ammo, cause I run out of ammo so fast I feel like I’m playing a game that using weapon reload mechanics.",23,1585430829,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqsyhh/why_isnt_eternal_clicking_for_me/,Doom,3

Especially the whole techno sentient thing going on, it just made me get a huge nostalgic moment like I was battling a Precursor robot again.

fqstor,RedBeardSince98,Question About Hell and Urdak,"So, after Eternal, we know that the ""soul"" is a real thing. We also know Hell to be... well, Hell. But my question pertains to whether or not ""Hell"" in Doom is the literal, biblical ""Hell"", or whether it is just a fiery dimension with beings that look like monsters (ie, Demons). Right now, I'm leaving towards the latter. 

But if so, then why does this notion of a ""soul"" exist at all? 

Regardless as to whether or not ""Hell"" is just an aggressive dimension or the biblical ""Hell"", we know for certain that Urdak is not ""Heaven"", as the Maykrs didn't even know of Hell's existence before the Slayer arrived.

It just seems very... odd? As an atheist, I'm super cool with both of these just being alternate dimensions, but the inclusion of more magical - elements like ""souls"" it just seems strange. Like, if these are both just alternate dimensions, does the biblical ""Heaven and Hell"" exist in the Doom universe?

Soooooo confused, ahhhhhh.

Was hoping that someone could clarify, in case maybe I misunderstood the lore, or missed something.

fqrxpa,walentaz,How on earth people find Marauders so hard / or annoying?,"I know I'm late to the party a bit with such topic, but I had to finish other game before taking on DOOM Eternal.

I'm playing on UV difficulty and to be honest they're even quite fun. I've completed time trial to kill Marauder in 30s and it wasn't all that hard. In regular encounters or one of slayer gates they don't even make threat and you can kill them fairly quickly whenever you want (as soon as he spawns or leave him for last). 

At first I was killing him with SSG, but then discovered ballista works even better - if you're quick you can hit him twice or use explosion mod - but obviously everyone digging the game knows this already. I'm just telling it's not that hard to figure them out and take'em out efficiently. 

Overall he's pretty harmless compared to a lot of other heavy demons, he's not all that spammy (and whatever he does is easy to avoid). 

I've watch several reviews prior getting the game and quite a few reviewers were bitching a lot about them, so I was kinda expecting them to ruin fun I'm having - just to eventually find them quite fun and engaging - YES I like Marauder encounters. 

So it got me wondering - how so many people find them so hard or annoying? If you're any decent at the game they're no problem whatsoever and at worst, you can look for tips/guides on the internet (I'm sure there are many of them by now) and quite a few different effective strategies.",7,1585427591,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqrxpa/how_on_earth_people_find_marauders_so_hard_or/,Doom,3

In the second clip, the first weird thing I noticed was the green thing taking two punches rather than 1. It's been a consistent glitch and I've tried the level several times to no avail.

So given these glitches my guess is the game is double-spawning some environmental items like doors and punchable green objects, but then again that doesn't explain why the switch didn't do anything when I punched it.

fqrpbr,arxero,The Marauder is nowhere near as bad as people claim. [Nightmare/PC],"I just completed the game on Nightmare/PC and I truly don't think the Marauder is that bad. I am by no means a fantastic FPS gamer. 

The first encounter with him is easily the hardest of the bunch due to the flat terrain and closed room (and obviously, learning the mechanics to fight him).

Subsequent encounters are much MUCH easier due to vertical terrain (you can stagger him while he is jumping), explosive barrels, larger arenas, and other factors. 

\- You CAN damage and oneshot him with the BFG (I did it on the first Slayer Gate involving him). Must be done while his eyes are green, tricky but it is doable. I don't know if this is an oversight (the tutorial clearly states that he is immune to Superweapons), but it is confirmed 100% possible.

\- You CAN stagger and damage him by strategically placing splash damage explosives behind him (Grenades, Rockets, Arbalest, etc..) 

\- For larger arenas where he appears amidst other demons, you can (and should) easily outmaneuver him while picking off other demons, then deal with him at the end. Chances are you'll damage him mid-fight anyway if you're using aforementioned splash-damage weapons.

\- The speed-boost-after-glorykill rune helps immensely. So does chrono strike and (obviously) saving throw. Praetor suit upgrades for fast dash recharge and dash refill from glorykill also help.

Once you learn his moves and fit yourself in that sweet-spot (distance) he really isnt that hard at all. Each shot you land (stagger) grants you enough time to land **another** shot or two (especially if you weapon switch quickly). Rinse and repeat and I truly don't see what all the fuss is about.

Now like I mention in the title, I played on PC. I **CAN** see how the Marauders would be difficult on Console w/ Controller, especially if you have a low sensitivity. Most console streamers I've watched during the fight have extreme difficulty keeping up with his movements.",1,1585426854,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqrpbr/the_marauder_is_nowhere_near_as_bad_as_people/,Doom,4

I opened %USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\id Software\DoomEternal\base\DOOMEternalConfig.cfg to see if I could find anything in there, but all that's in there are the default bindings, numerous times over.  Nowhere in that file is there a 'bind ""E"" ""_moveforward""' or any of the other numerous changes I made.  I've also rebound ""T"" to something, which as far as I can tell means I lost text chat if I ever do multiplayer, and I can't find anywhere else to bind it in the menus.

Is there either a secret keybinding menu somewhere that I can't find (I've only found the Slayer and Demon keybindings) or else a file that actually has the keybindings I've made?

Doom Eternal was the first and only game to have such crashes, and I can't believe a game could do so much system damage. My console is a little over 1 year old, and it's in otherwise perfect condition.

Bethesda has not been helpful, and they haven't even addressed my concern when I filed the support ticket. Now I'm out of a $500 console, and frankly, I'm not even sure I'll be purchasing Microsoft's console next gen. considering how disappointed I am that something like this can even happen in the first place.

fqpoe0,Baconthanos,Story inconsistencies,"For a while, I denied the idea that The Slayer is doomguy. This is because, given the lore from Doom 2016, this would create huge inconsistencies. When Eternal confirmed that the two were the same, I expected these inconsistencies to be explained. They weren’t. In fact, they were only made worse.


Lets start from the top. Doomguy went from one Earth to Argenta, to hell, to a different Earth. So obviously there are just multiple alternate dimensions, right? Well then, who’s to say there are somehow only two (nearly identical) Earths? If there are multiple Earths, surely there would be multiple Doomguys, multiple Slayers. Then another question arises: “How did Doomguy get from one dimension to another?” Obviously, the answer is through hell, as at the end of 64, Doomguy remains in hell, only to wash up on the shores of Argenta. But if all these dimensions are connected through hell, and there are several dimensions, there would also be several Doomguys in hell. Now sure, The Slayer got boosted by The Seraphim, but even before that, he was a force to be reckoned with. The demons still feared him. Surely the demons wouldn’t just forget about the other Doomguys, right? Now, this means that the dimensions could not be connected through hell. If this is the case, the question rises again: “How did Doomguy get from one dimension to another?” It couldn’t be the Makyrs’ doing, as Doomguy was in hell, and at this time, they had no idea hell even existed. So the Makyrs can’t bring Doomguy over, Hell can’t act as a sort of dimensional Nexus, so then how is any of this possible? 



Another point is huge inconsistencies with time. We see in Doom 2016 that the UAC was able to excavate statues of The Slayer wearing the Praetor suit from hell. However, the slayer testaments tell us that The Slayer got The Praetor suit after The Titan was slain. The Titan in the testaments, by the way, cannot be the same one found in Taras Nabad, as The Titan from the testaments is a decomposed corpse in Doom 2016, and serves as the setting for Titan’s Realm. This could only mean that The Slayer killed The Titan after he was trapped in hell by Deag Grav, the result of The Betrayer’s betrayal. However, the betrayal marked the fall of Argenta. This means that there would have been nobody around to carve these statues of The Slayer. The Statues clearly aren’t made by demons, as they look very similar to ancient Argenta architecture, and they look exactly like the statues found in Argent D’nur. On the topic of ancient Argenta, The Slayer clearly arrived in Argenta territory after this ancient age was over. Samuel even states that the ancient city in the core of mars was before the time of The Slayer. The only way these statues could possibly exist is if the people of ancient Argenta somehow looked forward in time, saw The Slayer killing demons (they didn’t even know what demons were at this point in time), and decided to make a statue of him, which, of course, makes no sense whatsoever. The only other way these statues could exist is if The Slayer went back in time before getting crushed under a temple, fought against something with the people of ancient Argenta (couldn’t be demons, demons hadn’t invaded Argenta yet) and then went forward in time to get trapped. Seeing as there is no evidence that time travel is even possible in this universe, I find this very doubtful.



Another time inconsistency, and one that is far less convoluted, is the Icon of Sin. The Icon of Sin is killed in Doom 2, which comes before 64, which comes before The Slayer’s arrival at Argenta, which comes before the betrayal, which comes before the creation of the Icon of Sin. So the only way Doom 2 could be canon to Eternal’s universe is if the Icon of Sin decided to do some time travel and dimension travel, went back to Doomguy’s universe, got trapped in a wall, died, went forward in time, and then got taken by the makyrs. 


Tldr; Doom Eternal’s lore and story open massive inconsistencies, which, had I known about before Eternal’s release, would’ve only fueled my theory that The Slayer and Doomguy are separate entities.",15,1585420394,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqpoe0/story_inconsistencies/,Doom,0

fqpgu7,LamboDiabloSVTT,Question about something the game implies near the end.,"So, it's heavily implied that Samuel Hayden is the Seraphim who gave Doomguy his power a long time ago.

However, I feel this reveal conflicts heavily with Doom 2016 for two big reasons.

1) Samuel Hayden was a human scientist that got transferred into his current machine body. He already has a backstory. How is he *also* the Seraphim?

2) If he is the Seraphim, his actions in 2016 make no sense. He had seen first-hand the corrupting power of the demons, and how they will do nothing but conquer and take EVERYTHING they can come across. Hell energy ruined the Argentia species, Why would he run the risk of tapping into hell energy like this again?

Using the flame belch is vital to keep your armor up in order to tank damage from powerful enemies. Using boost and swinging around the environments helps you escape to find that imp to chainsaw for ammo or to glory kill for health. And The ice bomb helps you target those weak spots and turn the tables on the enemy. And I also love that the chainsaw refills after certain amount of time, where as in 2016 I used less frequently.

fqn4v5,cf4000,Doom Eternal gripes,"Doom Eternal changes a lot of things from the 2016 game to its detriment I think

* Your punch doesn't damage demons anymore, in a game that was known for punching demons. Even in classic Doom your punches deal some damage.
* You can't shoot enemies as much anymore, now it's about resource management, putting your exciting fights to a halt so you have to find a zombie to get ammo. If you played classic or 2016 Doom well, you should have enough ammo to fight, now to play well you have to do what the game tells you, that's less freedom, and I think most of the time, more player freedom is better for a game not less.
* Cool down mechanics
* I wish the game let us figure out enemy weaknesses ourselves rather than constantly telling us what they are via random pop up messages.
* Enemy introduction animations are gone, despite prerelease footage showing the Arachnotron doing it's own intro animation in the style of 2016's demons (Not present in the final game obviously)
* Revenant gets a totally new model for no reason. Apart from the shoulder pads the 2016 one looks just as much like the original design as the Eternal one, yet the Eternal one is inferior in how less scary it looks
* Almost no in-story explanation of what happens between 2016 and its own sequel
* 2016's more subtle story telling is gone for overblown story and exposition, with forced rip and tear memes directly put in the story, they say rip and tear in 2016 as well, but that was the narrator speaking disembodied from the actual events of the story. Alot of the story is things we already knew in 2016 as well, just repeated with more detail.
* Sam Hayden's role is reduced *greatly*. The character with the most dialogue in Doom 2016 almost does nothing now, despite the 2016 cliffhanger hyping him up
* Speaking of the cliffhanger, Eternal ends more abruptly, you beat the final boss and it's over almost immediately, no proper epilogue.  


Even new stuff has it's own issues:

* Fortress of Doom's terrible layout, in addition to all its doors that you have to wait till they open
* Music records you collected are thrown all around the huge fortress, even though Doomguy has a record player sitting right on his desk where all the songs could and should have been played
* Enemies and bosses are shown before their encounters constantly in tutorials. even if you turn the tutorials off, you'll still be shown unseen enemies, typically during the loading screen tutorials, or you'll get a codex entry about an enemy or a boss right before you face them
* Marauder is meant to look like the counterpart to Doomguy, but instead of being the Vergil to his Dante, and building a rivalry with him, this guy they've been hyping up so much is just a regular enemy.
* Lastly, the glory kill on the final boss absolutely pales in comparison to the glory kill on Spider Mastermind. I've been mostly subjective so far, but I really can't see anyone favoring the Eternal final glory kill, it's nowhere near as satisfying or original.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't going into the variety of glitches I faced in the campaign, despite never seeing any glitches in the previous game.

fqll2m,TheRealMrDoctor,I just can't get over it,"So, I love Doom Eternal. The soundtrack is top tier, the movement is crisp and clean, the glory kills/animation altogether are wonderful. But damn man...a few things in this game are so bad they stand out too much. And that is the god damn voice acting. 

ID Software for some reason changed the serious and good voice acting from the Phobos trailer, to goofy and just plain terrible voice acting in the release. I feel like a lot of it was half backed and probably a little too fan-servicey. I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but that's just how I felt overall after reflecting on my enjoyment of the game with some of my friends. I couldn't get over it.  

But the biggest thing of all: Why the hell is Doom Guy talking? I feel like this is what ruins it the most for me. Hearing him say ""rip and tear"" was annoying, immersion-breaking, and kinda cringe. The voice acting for Doom Guy wasn't good, to begin with, his voice lines really didn't have that much substance, and it just felt really out of place. I can understand the whole ""hatred and PTSD"" thing they were trying to go with, but still just didn't fit right. I couldn't put myself in the game the same way I could with 2016 and I feel that it is mostly because they gave Doom Guy voice lines. Overall, I just wished they would've kept the silent protagonist.  To me, Doom Guy was much more badass as the mute type. I could project any image on him, any voice, and it would stick. But now, that is pretty much gone. This might be a nitpicking complaint, but in my mind. It's big.",1,1585407136,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqll2m/i_just_cant_get_over_it/,Doom,1

fqkt14,nicholassducker,Battlemode Demon Match-Ups,"Anyone who plays enough demon knows that picking a demon that complements your team-mate’s choice is crucial to success. As such I developed a list of what I believe to be the best team-mates for each demon.

The Mancubus is a very tanky demon that can punish The Slayer for positioning themselves badly. A zoning demon like the Archvile is the perfect choice to push The Slayer into bad positions that the Mancubus can punish them for. The Pain Elemental is the second best choice as it has some good zoning tools as well as some tanky pressure to keep The Slayer from focussing to hard on the non-nimble Mancubus.

The Marauder had high damage output up close but his limited health pool means he needs a team mate that can provide enough pressure to avoid going down too quickly. The Pain Elemental is his best match-up but the Archvile and Revenant can be used to good success if played well as a team.

The Archvile is the king of zoning and as such needs a team mate that can punish the slayer for bad positioning. As per above, the Marauder or Mancubus are ideal team-mates.

The Pain Elemental is similar to the Archvile in that he wants the Marauder or Mancubus as his team-mate but while the Archvile prefers Mancubus the Pain Elemental can really shine with the Marauder.

The Revenant is a hard choice because I feel he is weak overall. The Mancubus can be used as a tank to allow the Revenant to provide ranged damage or the Archvile can be used to help provide cover and zone pressure to allow the Revenant to safely lay down hits.

Overall the Archvile is most versatile as he pairs well with everyone except Pain Elemental (still pairs but not as strong).

I don’t pretend to be an expert so anything you think I got wrong I would love to hear in the comments :)

TL;DR:
Mancubus/Marauder + Archvile/Pain Elemental
Revenant + Mancubus/Archvile",0,1585404439,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqkt14/battlemode_demon_matchups/,Doom,1

fqkqly,Icepickthegod,Just beat DOOM Eternal. My thoughts.,"Wow. That was fucking awesome. 

I didnt think DOOM could get much better after 2016 but here we are. 

The combat is so much better now. It feels more mobile and deep. The new mechanics were all great. Blood punch, flame belch, dashing, ice bombs, etc. It feels like a FPS Devil May Cry. Even though I suck at it I still feel like a badass.

Platforming elements were really well handled and complimented both exploration and combat. For instance the falling platforms you latched on to kept the fast pace of the game as you had to quickly leap to another or else you would fall.

The environmental variety was really nice in contrast to DOOM 2016 which just featured a futuristic labatory in mars overrun by demons and a generic looking hell. Now you have icy environments, grassy environments, a post apocalyptic looking earth taken over by hell, a vibrant, futuristic and majestic looking urdak which directly contrasts the primitive and generic aesthetic of hell.

The music as expected is great. The same adrenaline pumping techno heavy metal style from 2016. ""The only thing they fear is you"" is a banger. I'm glad they kept BFG division in as well for certain parts like the demon prison.

The story is kind of a mess that is hard to understand properly even with reading the lore files but honestly who gives a shit about the story, its DOOM. 

I'd say the only glaring issues I have with the game is that it throws too much at you in the first few missions and missions take too long and should be split up more but asides from that its pretty much perfect. I heard people hated the marauder but once you realise you can two shot it with ballista combos its not a big deal. If anything the arch ville was the real sin. Not exactly bad designed but frustrating as all hell.

It just improves on 2016 in every way imaginable. I honestly don't see how anyone can genuinely prefer 2016 to this. Im not even a fan of FPS in general but i'd consider this to be one of the top 10 games of all time.",5,1585404206,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqkqly/just_beat_doom_eternal_my_thoughts/,Doom,1

fqjygh,Gloriouspieps,Battlemode is probably the most unfun mode conceivable,"Doom Eternal is great. I loved the campaign give or take a few nuisances and the final bossfight. Yet for me it's pretty hard to justify a 60EUR game purchase without some kind of online play. Doom Eternal offers one mode of play; ""Battlemode"". I've now played 18 hours of this mode and am confident I can finally say about it what I wanted to a while ago.

The concept is simple; you put 2 demons against the Slayer and whomever blasts the other into smithereens first wins the round. Demons are moba-like creatures with abilities, the Slayer is...the Slayer? The premise isn't so bad I suppose. The fact that it is 2v1 is slightly annoying for a multitude of reasons:

* Doom Slayer being alone means learning to play as him is about tenfold as tedious and frustrating
* Demons need to actually cooperate, but there is no matchmaking
* 3 people is in the realm ""can't play with best friend nor with group of friends""

But that wouldn't be a big deal if the gamemode were actually enjoyable. Sadly they managed to perfectly create the symmetrical feeling where both sides feel the other side is at an unfair advantage. The Slayer can rail people from across the map and blow up almost any demon in a matter of seconds. The Demons can repeatedly use a click-the-button-to-deny-slayers-fun with the deny loot - making it a seriously unfun game for them of running around finding ammunition you can't pick up when low on resources. Demons on the other hand rely pretty much entirely on this button, and having it on cooldown feels like being a sitting duck.

Then there is the issue of the skill gap. A good Slayer vs a bad Demon will be over in seconds. They will just die before even knowing they are fighting a Slayer in first place. This will immediately make the game impossible for their allied demon as well, as playing 1v1 vs the Slayer is, what a surprise, not very do-able. A good Demon vs a bad Slayer isn't nearly as bad, but it does make it harder to bridge the learning curve for the latter as there isn't anyone to lean on.

Demons also spawn creeps, if you hadn't noticed. Pretty much everyone I've seen play Battlemode ignores them entirely. You just hope you don't get proneblocked by them and blown up unable to move(which does happen occasionally). They are just annoying small obstacles. Neither fun to use for the Demons nor fight against for the Slayer. The latter obviously can't even begin to against half decent Demons.

Lastly the Demons *respawn*. This is the second most frustrating mechanic for the Slayer as it rewards defensive play for Demons. I played against a guy using Pain elemental and he would do hardly anything but hide in the corners of the map to have his friend respawn claiming ""me sneeky meatball!"". Obviously they lost, but I got 14 kills before the game ended, ruining pretty much any fun I could have had.

I just don't get how this mode made it into the game the way it is. The premise isn't bad. The fact that it's 2v1 is questionable, but could easily be compensated for. But why things like ""press button deny loot""? Why respawn timers on the Demons? What is the point of adding high priority creatures to a gamemode that relies on PvP? It feels like they made a horrible attempt at mimicking the base game's flow, and failed miserably.

no skin, i did all the FAQ's, followed the steps, pressed the reconcile my entightlements etc etc

i think the problem is when im on the rewards page, it just says sign in, then redirects me to amazon. theres no log in/out for my bethesda account and when i link my amazon it just says claimed

fqhabk,Dacidbox,Low cpu and gpu usage on Doom Eternal (common fixes not working),"After hopping in the game for the first time I noticed that my game was running way worse than I expected it would. After a while I noticed that both my cpu and gpu usage was only around 40%. I attempted to lower my settings, but even at the complete lowest ones I was mostly around 30 fps. I even lowered my resolution (which I feel like never should be the solution). After fiddling around a bit I managed to get to 30-50 fps, but very inconsistent. Changing the video settings in-game didn't seem to do anything, except add or reduce like 5-10 frames a direction. 

After this I tried to search online for solutions and found the steam overlay and fps counter thingies. Tried to turn them both off, nothing happened. I tried some other things aswell with my PC Wizard friend such removing and downloading the latest drivers again, turning off the Nvidia overlay and even changing a V-sync setting to fast in the nvidia controlpanel (as some reddit post recommended.

Absolutely nothing seemed to work and now I am at a loss. I had to refund the game, but I would be willing to buy it again if someone comes up with a fix, or the devs put their hands on this someday.  Imagine not getting to rip and tear some demon bootay just because of a performance problem. It's like Doomguy wasn't allowed to go out because he accidentally sniffled in front of his mother who then told him to stay in because of being ""sick"".

I played through every single doom game I know the series well so no I don’t need to be told about how I can get ammo upgrades and I gain new guns which also helps ammo consumption.

fqflrl,the_boomr,"PSA: If you're trying to add friends on the Bethesda Launcher, here's the solution","Ok. My buddy and I were completely baffled that there's no friends list in the Bethesda Launcher itself, and in-game you can't even search for friends by name to add them. SO. We spent about an hour repeatedly searching for Battle Mode games until we happened to get into the same lobby, and added each other as Favorites, and then were able to party up together that way. That works, but obviously requires a ton of luck and patience and it's terrible.  


Here's the real solution:

1. Install The Elder Scrolls: Legends. It's free to play and 7ish GB on PC.
2. Launch Legends, sign in with your Bethesda account, skip through the Tutorial by conceding the match
3. Click the friends icon in the bottom left corner
4. Add a friend, and search for your friend by their Bethesda username.
5. Have them also follow these steps, and accept your friend request.
6. Now, go into Doom Eternal, and check your friends list. You should both see each other there, voila!

Now I know this workaround is still shitty, requiring you to install a 7 GB game just to add friends, but at least it's a guaranteed way to do it, vs hoping you'll get into the same multiplayer lobby for an hour or multiple hours. Hopefully Bethesda and/or ID fix this shit as soon as possible though.",3,1585380678,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqflrl/psa_if_youre_trying_to_add_friends_on_the/,Doom,1

fqfax0,DXGabriel,A few things i noticed while comparing 2016 and Eternal... [SPOILERS],"Doom 2016 was **definitely** supposed to be a reboot from the start. The Slayer stuff was put in the game very late in development. Throughout the game you can see hints of it.  And this puts 2016 in very interesting contrast compared to Eternal.

The dead UAC soldiers giving you Points to upgrade the Praetor suit makes no sense considering it was made by a Seraphim.

The BFG still being experimented on and developed also makes no sense if the events of the OG games (or atleast 64) are canon now.

The Praetor suit also had human scriptures on it, hinting that at some point it was supposed to just be a suit all space marines wore.

The Lore feels a lot more human based in 2016. Samuel Hayden was obviously just a guy who would go to any lenghts if it meant saving his species, and thats what set him up as an antagonist in the end. He doesn't want Argent Energy destroyed becayse that would doom humanity. But in Eternal apparently he is the Seraphim who gave the Slayer his powers. Some proofs include:

VEGA says his architecture is similar to the Doom Fortress

He has vast knowledge on Urdak and the creation of Argent.

The voice is literally the same.

Samur = Samuel

The ARC scientist were not able to enter his system because it was ""Alien""

All in All, I found this interesting to point out now because i just realized Doom Eternal was the first game made focusing on the ""legendary slayer"" point from the start, whereas in 2016 it was obviously a last minute decision. Thats why Eternal focuses much less on humanity and machines and a lot more on Magic and artifacts. That's why sometimes it doesn't really feel like a sequel to 2016. (To me atleast.)

I just feel the need to say that in no way am i saying Eternal is a bad game. Im just analyzing it.",2,1585379109,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqfax0/a_few_things_i_noticed_while_comparing_2016_and/,Doom,1

fqdpp3,creepingorion,"PSA: Do NOT hit ""Reset Mission"" in the pause menu after beating the game","I've been running through the campaign again in Mission Select to grab all the collectibles, challenges and Slayer Gates I missed. However, I've noticed that when I come back to the Fortress of Doom, I can't access the Ripatorium. I've tried quitting the game and restarting, as well as reloading from a checkpoint, but neither of those worked. So, I then noticed the ""Reset Mission"" button in the pause menu, and I thought my solution might be found there. I did read the warning about resetting mission select progress, but I only thought that meant up to the last level you replayed. I was mistaken. Every suit token, Slayer Gate, challenge, and collectible I found from the first level all the way up to Taras Nabad I collected after finishing the game were reset, and I have to go get them all again. All because I couldn't get into the Ripatorium. Thank goodness I didn't wait until I collected absolutely everything, I guess. Hopefully, someone else will read this and spare themselves this inconvenience.

Any employees at id, if you read this, please know there is a problem with accessing the Ripatorium after beating the game. The prompt to activate the teleporter at the Ripatorium terminal does not appear. Also, wishful thinking, do you think you could put some kind of jukebox terminal in the room?

It only goes if you attempt the slayer gate.

When my brother played it, the music was much more fitting and the heavy music only kicked in during battles. However when he got to Hebeth, there was no music at all. Just silence during the combat encounter.

This is my favourite level so far in the game but it’s really being spoiled by this. Surely somebody else has ran into this bug?

fqby47,whwatson58,Prepping for a UN run. Could use some advice.,"So I've played a lot of 2016 in preparation for Doom Eternal on Nightmare, and now I've done roughly 3.5 runs.  I would like to start getting into Ultra Nightmare with the goal of making it half-way through the game.  I want to start humble because I really don't ever see myself making it through the whole game.  Maybe up to, or through Arc Complex.

I don't struggle with Marauders generally, I have a reliable and quick key binding setup, and strangely,  I find Nekroval 1 and 2 to be fairly easy (1-2 deaths on my second and third run).  Final Sin can be brutal if I'm not playing up to par.  I've also managed to beat the first 2 levels without dying, though not consistently.  I struggle with the mid-game the most.  The fight where you drop from the elevator is pretty much my bane, and I don't always deal well with small enclosed cube shaped areas with heavys or Whiplash enemies.

I'm looking to troubleshoot a problem with inconsistent performance.  Sometimes, I demolish everything in my path and walk away from my fights with full health and armor.  Other times, I'm an irredeemable screw up and I can't stop dying.  I need more consistent performance but I've hit a bit of a wall and I seem to be hovering at my current skill level.

fqbxde,phobos876,How would anyone feel if a Doom game ever had a full song with lyrics?,"I'm talking about something akin to Metal Gear Rising's and most Devil May Cry games' soundtracks.

I feel like they could get some fitting muscal artist/band, one that could work along with Mick Gordon, to make a song that would fit.

Mostly because of how reboot Doom is compared to character action/hack and slash titles.

I know about songs like the Gladiator's theme with the ""Kar En Tuk"", but i know there's fanmade Doom songs where people wrote lyrics in them.

Something i thought of was a remaster of Doom 2 Map 5's ""Doom"" where the song has parts of someone yelling ""Doooooom"" (I think in an episode of Scott Tobin's Composers Play, Bobby Prince said the song was supposed to have parts where it sounds like something is saying ""Dooooooom"").

And then, that Map 5 remaster would have typical Heavy Metal lyrics with anger and there could be some dramatic chanting.

In fact, some of classic Doom's most dramatic, horror based or suspense-like music always felt like they could work with chanting or a deep dark sounding choir (Like how Eternal has a song with that, that showed up in the first mission where you enter the floating castle with the priests).

But that would be mostly latin or some gibberish that would sound like Sanatic chanting.

I think in some of Andrew Hulshult's music remasters, he used chanting in them.",0,1585364032,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fqbxde/how_would_anyone_feel_if_a_doom_game_ever_had_a/,Doom,1

fqbte5,Kaiju-Man257,A realization I’ve had about the Seraphim (Spoilers),"So it’s implied that Hayden is the Seraphim, and that he stole the Father’s essence to make Vega. 

After that, the Khan Maykr would deal with Hell to get Argent Energy so she could preserve her people. This caused the civil war in the Night Sentinels, and we all know how that went. 

Later, Hayden would be the one to awaken the Slayer, and would work alongside him to fight demons and eventually lead to Urdak’s destruction. 

Well, my question is why? Why did Hayden/Seraphim steal the father in the first place and create this conflict? And then why would be go back on it and create a solution (the Slayer) and lead a resistance against Hell’s invasion? 

Before his interference, everything seemed fine. It seems like he just caused all the bad stuff to happen. 

But now he also seems to be the key player in helping stop all of it? 

The Seraphim is a walking contradiction!

Running out of ammo in a doom game is like a cool down bar in contra. Marauders? They tell you how to fight them. They know how much they suck. It doesn't just such that they can block off a BFG shot like it was a feather pillow or that they can move faster than my reticle or even that medium distance is meaningless but they stop the game. It isnt ripping anymore. It isnt tearing. It is waiting for an opening in a game where the sole purpose is to be as dominant as possible and wreck everything. 3 of these guys would own doom guy all the time every time. 

And the constant gun switching... look. I get it. 2016 had some of the most broken guns. A double barrel that took 1 ammo and could drop pinkies like the old days. A stationary cannon that could kill a hell knight with 2 head shots or 1 body shot with quad damage. But why does it simply feel like I am following a guide that someone else carefully crafted? I want to murder scores of demons my way. Not using a weapon specially built for the task at hand.

I searched up '2080ti low framerate' and someone on steam forums for another game said to turn off Steam Overlay and Big Picture Mode before running the game. So I tried that and it actually gave me a 100+ fps boost!

It doesn't help that my normal punch attack is useless as well.

 It's incredibly frustrating and it blows my mind that the developers did not anticipate or care about this being an issue during gameplay. It's such a basic thing and it kills all of the fun and momentum. The easiest fix would most likely be to give the player an infinite ammo pistol like in the first game.

fq9pnv,DarkBrassica,How is Battlemode online handled? Is it dedicated servers? I got issues with it...,"I'm from Australia and I don't know if it is a lack of Oceania servers like most games have or if it is horrible netcode, I can usually handle lag even if it is annoying but this is on a whole new level. The netcode is so bad that I got meleed by a Cacodemon which knocked me not away from the Cacodemon but back into it which in turn got me melee combo'd by the Cacodemon 5 times because the game thought I was being hit by the opposite side of where the Cacodemon was hitting me so it was as if I was being pulled into multiple melee hits​.


Another example is I was attempting to jump over lava but ranged enemies attacks were dragging me backwards rather than pulling me forwards so I kept falling in the lava due to the game not syncing online properly. Why are the NPC demons so screwy with netcode, I can understand the other player demons having lag but why are the NPC demons affected by such a thing, that should be client side for the slayer since the only times Player Demons interact with NPC demons is when they spawn them in, that's it.
Don't even get me started on trying to chain myself to player demons with the shotgun or even worse trying to set up glory kills, because the lag is so bad you can't set them up because the demons magically die half a second later when they get staggered due to for some reasons NPC's not being client side.


This lag persists when I play with 2 other mates who live nearby so it isn't the enemy demons being in other countries.
Demon gameplay is not as frustrating because you don't have to deal with NPC demons but going behind cover and taking magical balista damage isn't nice either when the slayer is holding the chainsaw instead.




Battlemode is good but the servers ruin the experience and I only play it if it is a weekly and not for fun.

fq9m34,Baal_Morgogh,120 Battlemode matches later. A review of the multiplayer component of Doom eternal and why it does not work.,"Let me begin by saying that Doom eternal might be the best FPS game I have played, talking purely on nightmare difficulty. I was always a huge fan of hyper-shooters, quick switching combos and high-skill ceiling, combined with the high AI difficulty these games possess. With doom eternal, some time before came games like Wrath: Aeon of ruin and several other old-school inspired games. Needless to say I believe, if you're like me, the last 2 years have been very interesting. Doom eternal's Single player component might be the best, by far, out of any old-school inspired/legacy continuing games. It's very difficult, it's unfair, it will test you and it will frustrate you. But once you learn the basics and a few advanced methods like comboing very fast, you will feel superior.   


Unfortunately, the multiplayer component of Doom eternal is not that good. I have been playing it extensively the last few days for achievements and milestones. As someone who grew up with high-speed first person shooters, I see why ID chose to implement something like this, to compliment the single player component and the universe in general (demons and slayer in one match) but the sad truth is that it does not work and it's not fun, at all. It was interesting the first 20 matches, then that's it. It's done. The depth is not there, and the structure of networking and game systems do not support it. There are key points as to why the multiplayer is plain bad at the moment:  


\- **Peer to peer system**, with no regional lock. Teleporting players all over the place, input lag, frame skipping, and unpredictability on how the game should behave. Note: I use a 100mb VDSL on fast path, connection is not an issue nor it has ever been for me.  


\- **Poor animations**, the animations of slayer are plain horrible, just like they were in doom 2016 MP. The same goes for demons who do not behave as their single player counter part (Marauder, Archville mostly)  


\- **Glory killing/Chainsaw** will get you killed against any good duo who has discovered proper meta tricks. (Mancubus smoke infront with flanking archville firewall behind the slayer), (Rev rockets/pain elemental shield combo with hazard etc.)  Against people with less knowledge, it simply creates pace breaks and gives a free shield. I find this to be extremely lazy design.  


\- **Horrible UI layout and comfort**, 1-2-3-4 skills are not executable by pressing them, instead, you have to choose them and then hit your 'grenade' button to execute them. Which is a very bad design when we talk about something that tries to be competitive (Hugo's words, not mine). It is also very clear that the ui is designed for consoles, since the skills form a cross layout, probably confusing a lot of PC players.  


\- **Demons** feel very unfun to play when we talk about same skill-ceiling. You can imagine, that hitting a slayer who heals all the time is not really fun, nor is the absurd amount of damage you need to do to kill him. That is very evident on Marauder, who not only is a very accuracy-requiring demon, but with all the teleporting and lag around, it makes him totally useless against any competent slayer. The same goes for Revenant. They are quite probably the worst demons currently. Mancubus is by far the most reliable demon, with pain elemental coming second once you learn to use cover/dash and proper shield deflecting/traps. Archville can support good, with the teleporting ability he can be very elusive at the hands of someone who understands the class.   


\- **Map geometry,** the arenas feel very badly designed. While multiple lanes support chasing, multiple mobs and different sizes initially do more harm because they are effectively blocking your movement, in an already oversaturated with map detail game.   


\- **General progression is gimmick,** I dont really care about profile icons, titles, and the structural base my character stands on. These things feel very artificial. I dont mean that I dont like progression, I feel that the progression though is not rewarding in essence nor is worth remembering. Skins are always good, because you apply them to the character you play. But the rest is just rubbish.   


  


I do not have hopes of ID implementing dedicated servers or proper and decent PvP modes like CTF, DM and TDM, but I felt the need to express my opinion. You have literally the best engine for a multiplayer component like the modes mentioned. Those old-school modes, with dedicated servers and the simplicity of gameplay (slayers v slayers only, like in Doom16) would be much more successful. The problem with Doom 16 MP lied on innovative crap like playable demons and bad multiplayer netcoding. I feel that this is a hugely missed opportunity for ID, with the stagnation of decent arena shooters, Doom could easily be the #1 out there. Quake champions failed to hold the feel of old school in modernised graphics. There are literally thousands of people wanting to play decent, simple, old school arena shooters but we can't find any. Slap a customizable slayer on it, like Halo does armor customization and I guarantee you, you would have a decently big playerbase and clan matches. I dont see battlemode surviving with any decent playerbase in the following months.",6,1585355488,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fq9m34/120_battlemode_matches_later_a_review_of_the/,Doom,1

fq9hwr,Slp-apnea,I didn't think I'd ever get this invested in a game again (Spoilers),"If DOOM Eternal was a drug, I'd have to say it's crack (no, I've never done it before). So many aspects of this game is addicting. From the Hellish landscapes and lore, the head banging soundtrack, and the fast-paced combat. I can never go back to 2016 DOOM and other shooters in my collection are probably gonna be collecting dust for awhile.

Honestly, I don't know where to begin talking about this game. So much of it is polished, captivating, and phenomenal to me. Words can't do this game any sort of justice. There's little things that bugged me at first or wish I was fixed, but bitching about those little nicks would feel like nitpicking.

I love the fucking story so much. It's cheesy in a good way and there's a Lord of The Rings epicness to some of the lore and how Hell is handled. The Doom Guy (Slayer) is a silent, overly macho badass. He doesn't say a single word (except in a few flashbacks) and managed to portray so much character. From loading his shotgun, giving glares, and the way he executes foes. He's the perfect power trip avatar.

I thought the tracks in DOOM 2016 were good. BFG Division's pretty dope. I'd prefer if it had Andrew Hulshult compositions instead, but it was still okay to me overall. I wasn't huge on a lot of the techno stuff. This game though... holy shit. I think the tracks are even better than the last game's and it really compliments all the action so much. Seriously. The Slayer's Gate has got to be the new BFG Division. And The Only Thing They Fear is You heightens those hectic, claustrophobic, moments to heart pounding levels as demons close in on you. And you feel like such a beast tearing down everything that gets in your way.

Speaking of tearing, the combat... dude. I don't think I've had an experience or ever played something that felt really engaging or thrilling in a long while.The dashing, the difficulty, and the various ways to gain back resources always keeps you on edge in the arenas. You will die A LOT if you're not on your A game or don't utilize all the weapons and tools at your disposal. Learning how to use everything in your arsenal and upgrades makes this experience so awarding and it feels like you gain a little bit more chest hair as you master EVERYTHING. You'd think dying a lot would be frustrating, but oddly enough, it's not (at least in my opinion). It's just something you learn from, improve, and tell yourself ""I got this"". And combat dancing is just, so majestic in this game.

And I can't get over the way this game looks. Everything's so colorful, dynamic, and mesmerizing. From landscapes, monster designs, and the atmosphere. There's so much depth and everything is so refined with a brutal and over the top creativity. It really feels like I'm playing through a metal album or music video. And it captures the feel of DOOM so brilliantly.

I had brought up some little gripes earlier, but they blew over as I continued playing and finished the campaign. One of them was the platforming, at first. It just felt kind of jarring. But the problem was trying to play this game like most modern FPS titles and not DOOM. I see what they were going for with implementing some of the jumps, puzzles, and key finding. They were going for that classic DOOM look and feel, but upgraded tenfold and not overly complex. I mean, yeah, it's nice to keep slaughtering, but it's a good little breather from all the pulsating action and there's some real awarding goodies to discover.

I wish there was a way to replay the Slayer Gates without having to traverse through a level. Maybe there is, but I haven't found any menu options for it. Maybe in an update they'll add a feature for that.

Other than that though, I love this fucking game. I don't know how it'll be topped with an upcoming installment, but it's damn near perfect already. I'm gonna keep playing the Nightmare difficulty until I perfect my dancing. Then it's onto Ultra-Nightmare. I highly recommend everyone rent and play through this at least once if they're not set on buying it right away, new to the series, or feel iffy about the game.",0,1585355098,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fq9hwr/i_didnt_think_id_ever_get_this_invested_in_a_game/,Doom,1

I have no dedicated Windows 10 machine, so I run Diablo 3 on a 2019 MacBook Pro (i9, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, Radeon Pro 5500M). It’s a work laptop and it’s locked down, so no dual-boot Windows 10, so had to resort to my old personal 2012 MacBook. 

I already had a small partition on it with Windows 10, but only 35 GB and no updates in years. I squashed the partition, and tried installing on 65 GB. I spent most of the time trying to make a Windows 10 boot disk. I hope whoever made release 1909 at Microsoft dies a slow death because in the last downloadable release, they made one of the files larger than 4 GB which isn’t compatible with the FAT file system. Cannot boot properly from NTFS or exFat on a UNIX-based machine. I had to find an older release that would finally make the boot disk.

Finally got Windows 10 reinstalled with all updates. Updated my GeForce 650M drivers......to then discover that the drivers don’t go up to the required version for Doom Eternal.  It’s a 2012 NVIDIA adapter, what did I expect?!?  😭😭😭

- I died more to parkour than from demons;
- whoever tought carcasses, archviles, whiplashes, Doom Hunters and dread Knights are fun to fight should reavaliate their concept of Fun, as these enemies disrupt the pace;
- speaking of pace: the maurauder blocks too much, he should be more offensive ( keep damage the same though);
- speaking of pace part 2: the purple goo;
- Just like 2016, most weapons have a very superior mod, making the other one useless;
- I really liked the art style, but couldn't they really make Guns not float and glow green like a cartoon?

fq856e,the-cunning-runt,"After completing campaign, what do you think?","I completed the campaign (ultra violence) yesterday and am curious what people think as we start wrapping up and beating the game. 

I appreciated the campaign took me about five days to complete, where as doom 2016 I could do in about 2.5-3 days (I have a job so it’s not like I can play 10hrs+ daily). 

However, I felt like Eternal’s depiction of hell and demons was more machine and tech, and less flesh and bone like in previous doom games. I liked when you finally knock the armor off the Kahn Makyr and see that they are indeed flesh and bone.

And I hate to harp on the point that campaign isn’t enough to keep players involved for months, but it just isn’t. When I finished doom 2016 I started multiplayer. About 12 months and 10 echelons later I moved on to a different game. With Eternal, I have already moved on (I started replaying Horizons: Zero Dawn, fantastic rpg if anyone cares). 

Overall I give the campaign an 8/10, as I was indeed glued to it. But I thought the focus on the backstory of the doom guy was fairly cringe and not really in line with the theme of the franchise. And 0/10 for multiplayer, battlemode is a dumpster fire.

fq7tpl,crossfyre,"I love Eternal, but I have to be in a certain mindset to play it","I have a couple hours logged into Eternal, and I gotta say it’s my favorite FPS in years. In my opinion it blows 2016 out of the water. And I think a big part of why I like it is because it reminds me so much of Dark Souls - every time I die it’s frustrating, but it’s always because I screwed up somehow. 

But also like Dark Souls, this game demands your full attention. I’m playing on UV and I have to stay laser focused on completing each arena because death is always mere seconds away. It’s very mentally taxing. 

Now I have no problem with this, but it requires a certain mindset: I have to be in a reasonably good mood to play it. Otherwise I find myself wanting to throw the controller as I die for the fifth time in a slayer gate. And nowadays I’m almost never in a good mood... I have so much fun with Eternal but right now I can’t relax while playing it; I get too frustrated. 

Plus I don’t want to change the difficulty because that’s not the spirit of Doom - I don’t want to prance through this game on easy mode. I want to kick ass, and also get my ass kicked sometimes. It’s just a tough time, and I’ve had tons of fun with Eternal so it’s kinda sad.",8,1585349575,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fq7tpl/i_love_eternal_but_i_have_to_be_in_a_certain/,Doom,1

fq7ela,willpiggles,BATTLEMODE help.,"Just played an hour as the Slayer in BATTLEMODE. I did not have fun. A couple problems I noticed:

- why are mobs harder to kill and have almost no window for glory killing

- why is loot block even a thing, you die fast enough where it won’t matter if you have loot or not.

I gave it the good old college try and was very disappointed. I would shoot the Player Demons, run and find a zombie, somehow kill it with 3 shots and not get the glory kill, then finally I’ll chainsaw and still end up with no ammo. 

I feel like getting rid of loot block would make it fun. The entire time you play as slayer you are just running for your life. 

Anyways, what am I missing? I’m sure I could become better by getting my ass kicked for a few more hours, but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to struggle that much.  I consider myself a good Slayer as far as movement and weapon swapping in the campaign (ultra-violence). Any advice? Or opinions?

Firstly, this game is kicking my ass to the point of frustration. I only played Doom 2016 on the *hurt me plenty* setting but I found it pretty enjoyable and only somewhat challenging. I had to turn Doom Eternal down to *I'm too young to die* and I'm still getting owned by arachnobullshits and floating assholes. The constant lack of ammo is downright annoying (like this guy has a whole arsenal up his ass, but can't be bothered to lug around more ammo than a mall cop).

I'm not trying to shit on the game just because I'm bad at it. I think it's a solid FPS, and people seem to be enjoying it. Also, the weird, cartoony demons and annoying platforming are really not doing it for me.

I'm torn between pressing on or simply refunding it as I'm less than two hours in, and I'm past the age of sinking dozens of hours in a video game in order to ""get gud"" at it.

Khan Maykr has a limited move set, so instead of giving her more interesting attacks for late phase they gave her stage hazards (also stage hazards in FPS - puke). Gladiator was pretty cool. Doom Hunter was alright but he's basically a regular enemy so it makes sense.

Idk. I thought Cyber Demon and the tag team from 2016 were pretty sweet. Didn't love the Olivia boss but whatever. I just think that, as great as they made the combat in this game - and it is probably the best FPS I've ever played, make no mistake - they kinda dropped the ball on the bosses. 

Especially having Icon as the end game boss. He's great from a cinematic perspective, but it's basically a bad arena fight where you're forced to spam crucible because the boss is, himself, kind of just a big stage hazard.",2,1585344057,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fq62b1/does_anyone_else_think_the_arena_fights_are_way/,Doom,1

 After getting through the Master version of ARC without much fuss, I've been wondering whether I should give the game another runthrough on Nightmare, my only concern (other than getting frustrated by dying) is playing the game again but without my sweet sweet gear, that I imagine has become a crutch by now. My hope is that I'll adapt pretty easily seeing as I'd say I'm pretty good at the game now, but if the jump to Nightmare is large, I would probably rather avoid the frustration!

fq4b7z,Undead_Corsair,Will a Live Service Model work for Eternal?,"TLDR: As great as the game is (and worth every penny I paid for it) I think the limit to only one specific mulitplayer mode is a shame. I think the game has a lot more potential than that, especially if it's going to be live service and should have more modes. Thoughts?

I am going to preemtively apologise for the fact that others have probably already talked about this at length and if you're tired of seeing people question the mulitplayer then by all means ignore me. 

Now here are my thoughts in more detail:

What I'm personally curious about now that I've finally got the game is whether it can really support the live service model id is apparently going for. If we're being offered cosmetics and such on a seasonal basis are we just going to be replaying the campaign and playing one multiplayer mode to unlock this stuff?

It seems to me a little limited in scope for a live service. Don't get me wrong, I'm entirely aware based on just the first few levels I've struggled through that this is a meaty campaign, and I know the singleplayer alone is going to be well-worth my money. But I feel sceptical of the potential for this game to maintain a strong multiplayer community if we really only have one MP mode to play (and invasions I guess).

Battlemode seems pretty cool to me, but it's such a specific setup, I feel like things will feel very limited if this is the only MP available.

Yes I'm basically making the 'why no deathmatch?' argument. I know deathmatch is not an original concept, but I still think Eternal's gameplay proves it could make the conventional concept it's own and make it something great. I feel like there aren't that many arena-style multiplayer shooters out there at the moment, at least not any that stand out, and I would've thought it's the perfect void for Eternal to fill. Why not carry on the torch of Quake Arena?

I also feel like there are other styles of game mode that would be a nobrainer for this game. Something in the style of infection would probably work great, with teams of slayers being whittled down and respawning as demons as a match goes on. Also I can't help but think how amazing a wave-based PvE co-op mode could be. Imagine being able to join up with a friend online in an arena to rip and tear through waves of demons together, imagine the potential for epic combo moves.

I feel like with a more substantial multiplayer I'd be psyched to progress and unlock cosmetic rewards, I'd even be happy to pay for some fairly-priced cosmetics too. But as things stand I'm not sure how long Battlemode on its own could hold my interest, I'm not even sure if I'm going to be any good at it. I'll be down to replay the campaign too, but I can't imagine I'll be replaying it really frequently.

I know at lot of this has been said before, and as far as I know the devs are not interested in adding additonal multiplayer modes, but I haven't directly discussed it with other players so I'd like to hear what others think. My questions for other players would be: Accepting that the game is great as it is, do you wish there was a more diverse multiplayer? Do you, like me, wish there were more modes on offer? Do you think there's any potential for new modes to come eventually? How much have you played Battlemode and how long do you think it could hold your interest? If you do like Battlemode is it enough for you or would you like more modes? Do you think a live service is going to work with just one very specific style of MP and the campaign to replay? What info do we have from the devs on this subject?

fq3tst,Improvology,Why have the Previous weapon when you could access all weapons instantly and quickly? Remove the weapon wheel Delay for the Console Players,"If no Keyboard and Mouse support for Consoles, At least do this or give us the option for quick switching with the whole arsenal


There is delay when you press the weapon wheel button which prevents you from weapon switching fast.  

If you press the button quickly you weapon switch to your previous weapon.  I understand why this is in the game and yeah i guess it makes sense but you could have something way better, access to every weapon. instead of the previous weapon

But to access the weapon wheel you wait 1 second then it comes up then you can select your weapon.

On PC you can switch weapons much faster and easier Im assuming.  I have seen footage of people switch very quickly and precisely.

fq3dd5,Hyderfiy,Some thoughts - Am I alone?,"To start, Doom 2016 was the FPS in about a decade. Doom Eternal continued that trend. It is certainly my favorite FPS and I will continue to play and re-play it etc. However, below I list some irritating points some of which are first would problems, others I feel are a step back from 2016. I have seen some of these points echoed else where but not all of them: 

* Anyone else disappointed that most arenas where spoiled in the trailers?  I wasn't really surprised by new areas in the game. 
* On the same note. The ending monologue and some other cinematics and/or monologues were spoiled in the trailer.
* Same goes for enemies. Besides bosses (of which I think they shouldn't have showcased the doom slayer), there wasn't a ""oh shit"" moment of a new enemy reveal. 2016 at least intros when new enemy showed up. I think they shouldn't have abandoned this flair.
* As someone who blasts through a shooter like this, the game also wasn't really that much longer than a typical fps. I guess ""longer"" means if you spend an extra 30 minutes per level finding every secret.
* Story/lore took a back seat in 2016, but it was handled better. Besides &gt;!""you can't shoot a hole in Mars ""!&lt;, the personality of the doom slayer was lacking in eternal.
* The UI is a huge step back and is less refined than 2016.
* The demon design is an improvement but the game ultimately looks more cartoony/arcade.

There are probably more. Doesn't stop the enjoyment of the game mechanics which I think have largely improved. The Marauder was a good addition.",4,1585336118,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fq3dd5/some_thoughts_am_i_alone/,Doom,1

Not sure where this is coming from as it was far from perfect. The latter half of the game drags on with monotonous battles and environments, there is a major lack of diversity of enemy types which makes this even worse, serious lack of bosses and mini bosses throughout the game and a storyline while not terrible left a lot of unanswered questions that Eternal did a great job of answering.

I had to laugh as halfway through their review the dude admits he didn't even make it to the 'underwater' part. So you didn't even make it to the halfway point of the game??

\-Both are gory standards from 90's   
\-Both had the uncanny early 3d games  
\-Both had ''all new'' HD remakes  
\-Hell - Netherrealm  
\-Both had one ''decent'' movie and an Annihilation of a movie   
\-Midway made both MK and Doom (64)  
\-They both cross different universes (DC and Quake)   
\-They both had to go just a little more cartoony art style to get the max fun in the latest release unlike the MK10 and DOOM 4 very hard try at being photo realistic (not a polarizing opinion, they are all quite amazing   


HERO  
\-often has very twisted satanic atmosphere (soul extractions, pools and rivers of blood, guts and corpses in heaps   
\- But it also has the more action, comic type of qualities (Doomguy is now roided as everyone in MK,   
head banging main themes)  
\-Doomguy - Mix of Scorpion (spear, fire, rage and dear deaths) and Liu Kang (main hero, although Scorpion was also an MK champion in DA or MKD)  
\-Doom Slayer is demon killing Demi-god - Liu kang was killing demons in demi god form  
\-Space and time traversal  
\-Archvile is now definitely Quan Chi with all of their baldness and resurrection  
\-S Hayden is SO RAIDEN or arguably Sub zero   
Icon of Sin is becoming stronger every second on earth - is pretty much his - I have to consult with Elder Gods  
\-Doomguy and Hayden have a really tense untrustful relationship - Same with Mk9 Liu and Raiden or of course Scorpion and Sub-Zero  
\-But they all good now

VILLAINS  
Olivia = Frost with all of their short hair and deception and exosuits and conspiracy   
Kahn Maykr - Kronika

There's just so much shit happening at once due to the levels consisting of mostly super heavy and heavy demons now. So here's something i'd like to see in the future:

A campaign mode which consists of only master levels. If Id made a master level version of every level in the game, it would be cool if they made it into a master level campaign. 

You would start off with all your guns, and possibly with all perks and sentinel crystals? This would make starting off not stupidly hard and boring since you would be out of luck killing tyrants and pain eles and what not with only your shotty.

fq0xdq,Drac0b0i,Doom x Brawl Stars idea,"We would add: Doomslayer (legendary)
Marauder (mythical)
Hell Knight Primo (skin)

Slayer: 5666 HP
Super shotgun (700x4)
Range: mid-short
2 shots. Reloads both at once. Reloads only when both shots used. Reload speed: very slow
Speed: Fast
Super: Berserk
Slayer gains a speed boost and can hit One brawler for 2500 damage. Can only target once per super
Charge speed: very slow
Super: BFG
Slayer shoots a projectile from the BFG 9000. The projectile moves very slowly, has decent range and inflicts 4000 damage. Also charges very slow
Gadget: chainsaw
On a very short range, the slayer inflicts 1000 damage. If an enemy is defeated this way, reload both shots
Star powers: 
Rip and tear
The slayer can now attack twice on his super
BFG (changes his super to the BFG) or Glory Kill (slayer gets 1500 HP back when Berserk killing
Skins: Default (eternal)
Night Sentinel
Demonic
Praetor


Hell knight Primo would be a Primo skin, based on the Doom Eternal hell knight


Marauder
4 shots
He alternates between a shotgun and an Argent Axe.
Shotgun: 600x4 Range=same as slayer
Axe (throwing or melee?) 1000 damage
Super: ?
Gadget: Argent Shield: The Marauder uses his Axe to create a shield. This lasts 1 second, but he can't attack during this period
Star powers: ?

fq0mnc,BotmanPlize,Why has DOOM 2016's (nearly perfect) QTE model changed?,"You may remember how  satisfying and fun was watching Doom guy manually opening a door or a roof hatch, getting a weapon or a Praetor suit upgrade from a dead body or smashing the Argent facility lenses. 

But DOOM Eternal Quick Time Events doesn't feel at all the same. 

Why am I punching the Night Sentinel holding a suit upgrade, while DOOM 2016 had a correction system that would quickly teleport you, for example, in front of the blue/yellow skull to retrieve, if you weren't perfectly aligned with it? 

Why is the Doom Guy no longer fist bumping the collectibles or handling anything in a fun way? 

Why is  ID software using 3rd person view for some cutscenes, when it would have been so much satisfying and fun to see Doom Guy handling stuff in a first person view? For example,&gt;! during the Marauder first encounter cutscene,  how cool would it be for Doom guy to handle and throw Samuel Hayden's metal carcass into the teleportation portal in first person view ?!&lt;

Am I the only one who missed those gameplay elements? Why would ID software change them?",6,1585328211,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/fq0mnc/why_has_doom_2016s_nearly_perfect_qte_model/,Doom,0
