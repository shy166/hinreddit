fsod2z,TheSuperdren,"Purchasing property, simon not calling","I finally convinced my friend to play this game and hes run into this bug. Hes created a second character already and transferred his rank and then he ran into a bug where he couldn't get a car saved to him and simon wasn't calling either.  So going back to his original character, we can't get Simon to call him. We've been to literally every convenience store, we've done the first Lamar mission and we've sat in a lobby for over 30 mins without a phone call from him. Please if any of you have some insight into this I would appreciate it!! I've checked old threads and no one seems to have a solution.

i know about the tv trick, but i‘m asking for those afk missions/job lists.

fsnb9j,JarifSA,Anyone else think nightclubs are ridiculously overrated?,"You have to buy a bunker, facility, and three of the best MC businesses along with the 1.4 million upgrade just to make good money. Don't forget  about the roughly 2 million total for all the storage and technicians. Not only that but also the pounder and upgrades for it and the van. God knows how much that money adds up to. Even with ALL the stuff to make the money, you barely make shit. I get that it's passive income but realistically it would take weeks maybe months before you make profit. But that's if you don't afk. I afked for maybe 7-8 hours last night and only made roughly 400k, even with the best business's and upgrades. I hate leaving my ps4 on but to make my money back I would have to leave it on for like what? 20 days straight? That's ridiculous. Everyone on YouTube says how amazing the nightclub is but I find it so frustrating. The only way I view it as good is if you do an afk job like the Petar Griffin which will also make your nightclub goods at the same time. And everyone says the Terrorbyte is good for money but it would like 47 client jobs before making profit. Client jobs are like the only reason why you should buy it but 47 jobs is hella ridiculous. And the safe feature is just garbage because popularity missions are not worthwhile ( you can just do a VIP work and make more).",31,1585695141,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fsnb9j/anyone_else_think_nightclubs_are_ridiculously/,gtaonline,0

It seemed nearly damn impossible.  Then I thought to drive along the railroad and it was a piece of cake.  After you get about half-way, the stars drop to 3, then 2 once you get close to the drop-off. 

From the Vespucci Police Station, I headed to the railyard behind Los Santos Customs in La Mesa, from there followed the railroad tracks all the way north. Once you make it to the rail yard and then the tunnel, you're basically home free. 

From the Paleto Police Station was a little different, there's railroad tracks right next to it, but it doesn't go all the way down to the city, so I ended up taking the vehicle through the hills.

So I say no, it's not fair because I did all the work and wasted time getting diamonds as loot. So they decided that I give one of them the 35% and the other 30% and the rest for me. So I did and gave the 35% to my level 39 friend because he recentky buyed and office and a cargo warehouse so he is short on money and the other hasn't bought anything and he has money. So the level 80 says yes to get 30% and when I give the takes he says no. Because I gave him 50% most of the time  when we did the Casino Heist the 2 of us (he helped me, but not everytime). And right now as I'm writing this he asks me why I gave to my level 39 friend 35% and not him.

fsjk9h,Spadooodios,Problem making anything business related on PS4 ? Simple trick to join a solo public session.,"So as the title says, if someone isnt aware, there is a pretty easy way to be alone in a public session (PS4 only.) Your PS4 network MTU settings will be 1500 by default. So as soon as you join online, activate passive mode, and hit the PS button. From here on: Settings &gt; Network &gt; Set Up İnternet Connection &gt; Use Wi-Fi &gt; Custom &gt; (the internet you're using) &gt; Automatic &gt; Do Not Specify &gt; Automatic &gt; Manual - set it to 800 &gt; Do not use. Then hit circle and go back to Gta. İf you are confused about the order or something else, let me know, and ill try to help. This will kick you from Gta Online, and once you re-enter Online, you will be alone in a public session.
Again, this is just for those that are tired of the griefers blowing you, your cargo and stuff up and want to do their deliveries in peace. This will prevent you from playing any multiplayer game modes unless you set the MTU back to 1500 following the same steps above, but instead of 800, put it back on 1500. Hope this helps someone out there at least. Cheers !",5,1585683215,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fsjk9h/problem_making_anything_business_related_on_ps4/,gtaonline,0

Everything is done correctly, but I still didn't receive any of the Twitch Prime rewards that I claimed.

My friend claimed his loot at the same time, he received the 1'000'000 $ almost instantly, the next day (yesterday) he had the 250'000$ and confirmation. But me, I still haven't gotten anything. Could anyone help me? Rockstar support never helped me, that's why I ask you guys on reddit for help.

  
Edit : I also picked up other games' rewards and I received all of the rewards almost instantly with very little to no delay at all so I know my Prime subscription is good.

fseck9,Derxes,Terrorbyte or Bunker Manufacturing Upgrade?,Been grinding I/E and doing VIP Work in between while I wait for the bunker to get goods.

fseasu,Ahmedkit,Greifer attacks my friends then instantly regrets it!,Yesterday I was going to play with my friends on GTA so I go on their profile to click join so while Im loading into the game( already in party) one of them says “Dude WTF!” and he wasn’t talking about us next second I hear one of the others say the same thing so at this point i was pretty sure there was something wrong in the game. I waited for mine to load only to spawn and get killed instantly when that happened I knew what happened. I call my oppressor and go kill that dude. He comes back again to attack but the session was my friends and I and that one guy we keep killing him he got killed a total of 20 times and killed me 3 times and 2 to this other kid. When at the end we were gonna kick him but first texted him why he greifed? He replied with you guys tried to do that to me too. So one of my friends replies and says if we were going after him he couldn’t escape as they are all high levels as in 200+ I’m only a 58 and is the lowest level there.,16,1585666472,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fseasu/greifer_attacks_my_friends_then_instantly_regrets/,gtaonline,1

Right now there are only super and sports cars, but other categories will come soon.

The database includes:

* Vehicle category
* Manufacturer
* Model of the vehicle
* Price: if available, I've used the trade price except for Arena vehicles, for which I considered full price. Arena and Benny include both the base vehicle price and the conversion
* Special features
* Returning: the car was previously in other games from the GTA series
* Other versions
* Liveries: the vehicle has liveries available. I've also listed the sponsor brands, so if you want to complete that Redwood or Princess Robot Bubblegum collection you can see which vehicles you're missing. I've also included liveries that have elements of a national flag

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, other categories will be added soon, starting with sports classic and muscles.

Other information I could add include real life vehicle counterpart, DLC release, drivetrain.

fs9ewg,No0b_MoDe_On,Beginner's guide to get started and earn money in gta online,"I have written this for people who are starting with 0 GTA$ and making their way into gta online.

So if you don't have a high end apartment, a bunker, a clubhouse or anything like that this method will make you earn a good amount of money to start buying some important things in gta online.

First of all, the most important thing is that forget investing money into a good looking house or a good looking car. You don't need those right now.

# Before you read:-

These methods have been tested by me and I now have 5,000,000 GTA$ in my maze bank account right now. However, it takes time. A lot of time. It may even take a month for you to reach this million dollar mark. However, this early hard work can pay off really well in future. And you soon might be making 100,000 GTA$ every day.

# Before you start making money, do this:-

An easy way to make your gta online experience better is by playing solo. You can either play solo session or a private public session. The solo session is the easiest way but later it might have restrictions. A private public session can be achieved by tweaking some settings which are different for pc and console. Invite only session can also be considered as an alternate for solo session.

A public lobby may have hackers which can ruin your early experience of the game. Public session may even have high level players that can cause chaos or can try to kill you. I had some difficulties trying to play gta online for the first time with players killing me in a public lobby.

# More is better:-

Before you start making money, it is always great to have a friend. It is not necessary but is always better. If you have a friend, you both can play in an invite only session and can play missions together (you both will earn the same).

Also, some missions may require minimum of 2 players. So depending on a stranger may be difficult due to no communication. So if you have a friend playing with you, it is always great.

# Starters:-

**A vehicle:-** 

Something wrong many new players do is that they try to invest money in more vehicles. I see people who show off their garage full of cars but didn't spend any money of profitable businesses. You need to know that buying more vehicles is not going to earn money. You just need 1 fast car, and you are ok to get started.

So you need a 'fast' car. For new players, the Elegy RH8 works super great. It is faster than most other cars and is ABSOLUTELY FREE.

To get this free car, just link your social club account with gta online and you have the car.

**Alternate method:-**

If you don't have a social club account or you don't want to link it. You can just find a decent car in the game and steal it. From there, just go to Los Santos Customs and make it yours by paying some money. 

You can store it in your garage anytime. 

But make sure the car you choose is fast. These cars are not that fast but will for a new player these are great

**A garage:-**

Where will you store you car? A garage. When you have just 1 car, you don't need to buy a 10 car garage or a 6 car garage. You just need a 2 car garage that is available on the Dynasty8 website for 25,000 GTA$. 

Now if you don't have that money, don't worry. Just keep reading and you'll get that money soon.

# Early money:-

**Contact missions:-**

These are one of the most easy way is to contact characters to earn money.

Basically, characters such as Lamar, Lester, Gerald, etc. will give you missions and tasks which you have to complete and you will be payed for each mission. Some missions may be easy whereas some may be difficult. Again, if you have a friend playing with you, missions can be completed faster and much easily.

Some characters may get unlocked later on in the game but I got my first 100,000 GTA$ by doing Lamar missions. Then you can do some Gerald, Lester, Trevor, etc. missions.

The maximum pay each mission gives is around 16000 - 19000 GTA$ when done at hard difficulty with no mistakes. To based on calculations, by doing 10 such missions, you get 160000 GTA$ minimum that is super great. And there are more than 60 such missions all over gta online.

And if you keep doing other contact missions, you will soon get enough money to buy a decent high end apartment.

**Treasure hunt:-**

Treasure hunt is the easiest way to earn 200000 - 250000 GTA$. But these are pretty time consuming and tricky. You will get a treasure hunt email at any random time and by collecting all clues, you will be given a revolver. Then do a special task with that particular revolver, and you will earn 200000 - 250000 GTA$ depending upon the task.

The task may be like 'get 50 headshots with the revolver'.

There are walkthroughs of each treasure hunt available. Just google them or search them on youtube.

There are many treasure hunts available but they don't come very fast. You'll have to wait for the email to come and then start the treasure hunt.

Doing all treasure hunts can give you minimum of 500000 GTA$. However, they can take a lot of time.

**Spin the lucky wheel everyday:-**

The casino has a lucky wheel. And you can get many things from it. You can win a car, clothing or casino chips. You can rotate the wheel once per day.

It is super great if  you are lucky enough. The highest prize is a car. 

Then comes 50000 or 25000 chips. If you get chips you can either use them in casino games, or you can convert it into money.

Which means, 1 chip = 1 GTA$ and 50000 chips = 50000 GTA$

You also get 1000 chips once every day for free. 

**Flight school:-**

There is a flight school in the Los Santos international airport. There are challenges you have to do in an airplane. Do all of them and complete them at gold medal. 

This will give you 240000 GTA$.

Plus, it's free and you will improve your flying skills

# When do you earn a million ?

It will take time and skill. There are many ways you earn  a million. And they take time and investment. So here are the 2 easiest ways to earn a million that take less investment.

**Facility:-** 

Once you have around 650000 GTA$ you can buy a facility from the maze Bank foreclosures website. The cheapest one is available for 650000 GTA$. From there you can start doing the Doomsday heist and unlock other heists as well. There are 3 acts which you have to do.

The problem ?

It requires investment and friends (not really).

So each heist requires the leader to invest into equipments. You may even need to spend more than 70000 GTA$ for each heist setup. You may even need a good fast and armoured car for better heist.

Then each heist requires 4 people. It is not necessary these 3 people are your friends. You can invite other players in the session to the heist. But many times those people can mess up or you may not even find any person to join the heist.

After all heists, I bet you may be a millionaire or close.

**High end apartment:-**

This is pretty easy. The cheapest high end apartment is less than 500000 GTA$. Probably 300000 GTA$. Just buy a high end apartment (Weazel plaza, Richards magestic or 3 Alta st.) and you can unlock the heist room. From there you can do heists such as Fleeca job or Pacific job and earn good money.

Again, you need 3 more people. 

Positive point, the investment here is lesser than the facility but the pay is also less.

# That's it. 

# After this, you are no longer a beginner 

and you can go ahead and buy a bunker or an office. Then become a CEO/VIP and unlock new missions. 

If you think i missed something, comment down. 

I hope it helped.

Just comment your own if wanting to do this.
Eastern Standard time is recommended for me and you in order to do this. 
You may make up to 1.2 mill depending on how long I run it, and depending on how long your willing to stay. 
It has had some glitches so you may make 400-500k based on what I have seen.
Put a rubber band on the right joystick when we do this so you don’t get kicked make sure it is pulling the joystick so your character is looking around on its own. Plug in your controller as well and you’ll be ready to go while I set up the afk.
I’m also willing to run an afk survival playlist that I have. But peter griffin in my total opinion I like better.

The heist system works well and helps to promote players choice by making you choose tactics. The voice cast has done an amazing job. 

 The online section is very much a mixed bag. Loading times are by far the biggest problems, with sometimes taking up to 20 minuets to join online.

fs7flg,howtocompk,Probably among the best and most addicting game I ever played,"The single player story mode lacked character development but made up for it through improved gameplay mechanics, graphics, and action packed missions. There is plenty to do in single player such as playing tennis, golf,  racing, etc that will keep players busy. It is a nice transition from the gloomy and gritty atmosphere from GTA 4 because the game highlights the glamours and greedy side of Los Santos.   GTA Online is also a noteworthy game to play and it has plenty of pros and cons in its own right. The ability to acquire properties, businesses, compete and/or cooperate with players makes this game an immersive experience and it makes you feel like you mature with your character. You will see your character grow from being a petty criminal doing small time jobs for Lamar and Gerald to becoming a successful mastermind criminal. While this model is rewarding, it is difficult and tedious to move up the ranks. This is especially true for those who are full time students and full time employees because they are time constrained. If you are time constrained, barely starting GTA Online, and still want to have fun in GTA Online I do suggest you purchase the Criminal Mastermind Starter Pack with is roughly $10. I added additional tips to save you the time from watching clickbait 10+ minute youtube videos.  The Criminal Starter Pack will give you $1 million, a CEO office, an apartment, MC Clubhouse, vehicles, weapons, and clothes. These properties might not be the best locations, but they are a good way to start earning money and once you save up enough money you can get better locations. With the money you earn I do suggest you avoid splurging it on vehicles. The only vehicles worth buying right away is the Kuruma and the Oppressor. The Kuruma will protect you when you do missions and the Oppressor allows you to travel quickly across the map. For aircraft, invest in a Buzzard and a Cargobob. The Buzzard is a great helicopter to use in missions due to its agility and its weapons allow easy kills. Being a CEO also allows you to spawn a CEO in most situations. The Cargobob is a must have if you intend to import and export vehicles.  For MC Businesses, invest in the Meth Lab, Cocaine Lockup and the Counterfeit Cash (in that order). Avoid document forgery at all times because there is little profit to be made from it. In fact, it is more profitable to do contact missions than to do document forgery sells.  Once you earn a decent amount of money, you can go ahead and splurge it on vehicles. I do suggest people wait when the car they desire is on sale. Every Thursday, GTA Online will have new discounts and double money/rp events so keep an eye on it on the Rockstar Newswire. Also, buy more businesses and renovations when they are on sale to save a lot of money.",4,1585633901,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fs7flg/probably_among_the_best_and_most_addicting_game_i/,gtaonline,1

fs6npi,poopsock_23,My friends and I have personally wanted a police/tuners DLC,"I think an ocean based DLC could do well with making naval warfare fun and adding nee boats. Rockstar could also add the aircraft carrier or submarine as like a water HQ where you could launch business missions  that would most likely be similar to smugglers run. The Tuners/Outlaws could involve players finally being able to purchase police, sheriff, and N.O.O.S.E. cars and uniforms. You could customize the cars to an extent like weather the Crown Victoria has the LSPD or BCSO livery on it and whether or not the sirens are flat or rounded, ect. Rockstar would also add tuner cars and some sort or illicit business or add drag racing for the cops to bust on top of the other in hame businesses. Maybe the player cops could have the option to sell or destroy evidence or turn it in, adding corruption among the police ranks. But that’s just my ideas for the future.

fs6g88,steakandwater,New job category idea,"The idea behind it would be that two players would compete against each other to finish one of the normal rockstar created missions at the same time. They would be in separate maps that are totally on connected to each other. So for instance, if one person was going to do death metal as their mission, the other person would also do death matter as their mission, but they would not be working with each other, they will be working in separate lobbies

We will be judged based on completion time, amount of kills, damage to their own loadouts (you’ll understand later)

Players will have a budget determined on the lobbies the same way you can determine if a race has catch up. After that, you will be brought into a screen similar to the screen where you can select the color of your vehicle in a race. There you are to select a load out of weapons, cars, and outfits which would be important if rebreather’s, thermal vision, or a bulletproof helmet would be used. So if your budget is $600,000, you could go all in and decide on a karuma, but this will leave you with very little money to spend on guns.

Or if it’s the mission where you need to fly to the top of the construction building, you could choose to waste your money buying a helicopter, but not having much money left over for weapons.

You could even set limits on the amount of things for purchase. For instance, you could set restrictions for the budget to be $750,000 without purchasing more than 2 things. 

Any leftover money would be able to be used during the mission, but will not follow you into freemode. For instance, if you purchase only a motorcycle for 15k to complete a mission with a 2 million dollar budget, you will only get the amount of money the job will normally warrant, which might be about 18k. You would not yield a $2 million profit",0,1585629244,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fs6g88/new_job_category_idea/,gtaonline,1

fs60sy,Red_Fox_Studios,I have an idea for when GTA 6 comes out what they can do for businesses and properties.,"A certain business I'd like to see return to GTA is the Motorcycle Club along with the arcade. I would like to see a combination of the two and the properties that you purchase are large, but when you buy them they start off small and can extend through either time or money. Either Rockstar can make it to where we buy the whole property at once, or we can unlock it along the way as we sell products and excetera. Basically the building can be super large. Like it has boarded up Windows, broken walls of the roof or something, and have it at a reasonable price maybe four hundred thousand like any other Motorcycle Club. Have upgrades earned and not bought which will give a bit of a challenge but we won't have to spend are GTA money or real money. Also I want the arcade to be a little part of the motorcycle club as an add-on. Also we should be able to extend the arcade as we go. Maybe challenges or product sells, make it something like it's a story mode but online and you unlock things along the way like the weapons or Heist. I think it's a cool concept.",0,1585627357,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fs60sy/i_have_an_idea_for_when_gta_6_comes_out_what_they/,gtaonline,1

fs4p8g,ashesALT,Deathmatch Win Loss Counters,"This has been bothering me for several years now; on your Social Club profile for your GTA Online character, there are stat trackers for how many wins and losses you have. You have your Deathmatch win loss counter, your Racing win loss counter, Parachuting, Golf, Tennis, not that many but there’s a few.
In a few gamemodes ive noticed that it tracks my wins and losses for non-TDM-based Deathmatches ONLY. When a Deathmatch was set to teams, it tracked win loss stats that ‘aren’t’ on the page. 
Let’s say the stats on your profile would have at least 100 wins and 50 losses. Yet when death matches are team based specifically and not free for all, it doesn’t track your 20 wins and 6 losses on the page for TDM, only the wins and losses you have for regular DM. This is incredibly bizarre and is as weird as the fact that stats aren’t highly detailed enough. They don’t list KPM, assists, hell even your own KD in Deathmatches specifically, and now they don’t track stats on the page that is being clearly tracked in game before the TDM starts?

fs3o6a,Bismarcus,War &amp; Love with a Motorcycle Gang,"Six months ago I told a tale of my experience with a bored youngster who just wanted to blow some shit up:

https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/dht689/a_heartwarming_story_of_mentorship/

Today I had a similar experience, not with someone who didn't know what to do with themselves, but with a motorcycle gang sorely in need of an adversary. 

Today I was on and Hyxed aP was on with his motorcycle club, and they had just started Stand Your Ground with their club. Like any normal person, I got in my Akula so I could go drop some bombs on them with no advance warning. I killed one or two. Then I got blown up by a jet, then I got spawn killed about 20 times by a tank. 

Eventually I got a text from him that said ""Why would you attack three high levels?"" And I said ""Why wouldn't I?""

After that I tried to get to my bunker, got blown up some more. Eventually I made it to my facility and from there I sent strike team after strike team at them, mixing in some muggers and Merryweather mercenaries. 

After a few rounds of that, he texted me that they were enjoying the mercenaries and strike teams. I was happy to oblige. I was on a conference call anyway, so I couldn't actively play. 

I kept this up for well over an hour. Every now and then he would text me to send more goons, and I would. 

After a few hours, I had a few minutes to actually play, so I took my Scramjet over to their newest spot and told them not to kill me. They came over and stood on my car, I jumped around some, eventually I caught on fire, shot into the sky, and exploded. 

I was asked to join their crew and even friended by Hyxed aP. Apparently I spent $80,000 or so sending mercenaries after them so they wouldn't get bored.

However, this week I've decided to give it a go and fill up all the businesses with master control. two irl days later I've called one of my friend over to help me out with selling the stuff. we've finally gathered. Right after I've registered as MC president, LJT called me that ""HEY, DESPITE THE FACT YOU'VE PAYED UP FOR SECURITY UPGRADE, YOUR BUSINESS IS STILL RAIDED LOLOLOLOL"". I slammed my table so fucking hard my soda can fell off. Thankfully it was empty.

So the raid somehow turned out to be a failed one and lost all the 420K.


Fuck you, LJT. Fuck. You. Fuck your contact icon, fuck your stupid dogshit voice, fuck ALL the 27K taxes you've taken off my nose.

frzg06,steakandwater,The job creator is absolute ass,"I’ve been fooling around with the job creator and it’s the least intuitive thing. It lags a lot and I suspect it’s because it needs to render the objects in a real map hence the switch view options, meaning that rapid placing of objects will cause lag

But also navigating menus is laggy

It doesn’t have quick options to modify weapon pickups in survival, which means you need to go through all 10 pickup options and turn them all to “advanced rifle” for all 20 rounds if you want that to be the pickup in every round.

It doesn’t allow you to build on maps you enjoy either. There at bare minimum should be a creator code you can use to make your own version of maps using creator permission, or at least it would say “by x person, based on y person’s creation” as to prevent people from taking credit for other people’s creations. I’m sure plagiarism was probably the logic behind not being able to copy maps but just either forcing creator permission or forcing people to give credit seems like an easy walk around.

 I’ve seen plenty of maps I’d love to make small additions to but can’t.

Fences and gates and whatnot don’t lock on to each other the same way track pieces do, this means that you need to place them manually which is very time consuming

Enemies need way more space for enemy spawn points than the game actually needs for their models, meaning you can’t have clever spawn points like inside of a booth, they need to be out in the open.

Another issue, the game requires you to make land vehicle spawn points for survivals regardless of if land vehicles are used in your mission, and the spawn points ALSO take a ridiculous amount of space. They need to be outside of the play area yet within a certain range of it, which means that certain locations of the map like on top of maze and tower are impossible to make survivals since the distance to the ground is greater than the maximum distance, and rooftops of other buildings don’t have space to place vehicle spawn points

Finally, you can’t make your own missions. It wouldn’t be hard, just give an objective (pick up the brief case, deliver it to a destination, increase the money based on the NPCs killed and distance of destination) why is this? I’d love to see people’s creativity, like beating up some body builders in a cage for a package and calling it a WWE belt. Or assassinating Isis terrorists in sandy shores. But rockstar doesn’t want to see this creativity, they’d rather see 4 million poorly made races titled “50x money glitch (ez money)”",2,1585602981,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/frzg06/the_job_creator_is_absolute_ass/,gtaonline,1

It is so funny, me running down the sidewalk punching everyone i get near, the police drive right towards me and stop and yell at me to stop as i run right past them. and like 100 yards later in a  straight line still punching people..

However, when it comes to landing a plane, I'm not so experienced, especially while under fire, so I wanted to practise. Here my questions:

After a while he started using the RC tank, so 
I hopped into my thruster. Seeing that, he immediately called in his MK2 and started going after me.

In order to get him away from the other people, I flied away into the sea, and he still kept following. As soon as he locked on, he fired 3 missiles and smuggily turned around, while probably thinking to himself ,,ez kill''. 

In reality, his primitive brain didn't know that the thruster can't be killed from behind(as long as you are flying in a straight line), so he turned towards me(again), kept following and fired all the missiles.

frr5s1,MicroNitro,Some people take this game too goddamn seriously,"This is hilarious because all that happened was that I was making a solo gunrunning sale. I was driving a dune FAV and I was on my forth drop where it was in the forest on the southwest part of the map, and a guy on a mark 2 comes way too close to my dune FAV. I got out of it and shot him off of the oppressor and blew it up and left the guy stranded in the forest because you can't call shit in from there. I made the final drop and I saw the guy register as a CEO and he teleported to his facility, and I sent him a text message saying *""You're about to obliterate me, aren't you?""* he stayed in his facility for a while and I went back to my arcade to play some games and he sent me this funny voice message. 

***""You can only hide for so long, but then it's going to be boom boom boom when you come out.""***

The guy sounded like an edgy 20 something year old trying to he intimidating but really, he was just a fucking clown. 

I replied: *""Bruh do you have anything better to do?""* 

He replies: ***""No. I wanna blow up little piss stains like you who think they can blow me up for 'no reason'. Your ass belongs to me boy."" 

I started dying laughing because this man is dead serious. 

I replied: *""You attacked me during a gunrunning sale. What did you expect me to do?""*

He sends another voice message and says: ***""I didn't attack you, you shot at me first, I flew over you, your ass belongs to me.***

I replied: *""You're riding a mark 2 and are way too close to my dune FAV and you expect me to not think you're about to blow it up?""*

He replies: ***""Payback's a bitch. I'm gonna blow you up. Get it over with, boy.""***

frqziy,GoodNooodle,Linked businesses in Nightclubs,"Prior to this post, I wanted to buy a new vehicle. But now I'm thinking that's not a very good idea because I have no way to make money except for heists and VIP missions. As of now, I have 4.7 mil (Idk how, I'm rank 30, I just grinded VIP missions and the original heists, I also did the casino heist once and act 1&amp;2 of Doomsday heist). I have 2 businesses, the bunker and the counterfeit cash. Both are stock, without any upgrades. Personally, I heard the terrorbyte is a great investment, as well as the nightclub. I also heard you can make upwards of a million using the nightclub sales if you link businesses to it.  I really need money, so I want to ask if the nightclub is a good investment and if it will help me make my money back. If so, which nightclub should I buy? And should I upgrade my bunker and counterfeit cash? And after that, what businesses should I buy? I would've bought more businesses long ago, but I'm pretty stringent with my cash, and I hate seeing losses even if I know it's an investment.

I really don't know how things work in GTA as I'm very new, even with watching those guides online. Any help would be much appreciated",1,1585575648,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/frqziy/linked_businesses_in_nightclubs/,gtaonline,1

frn9vo,SituatedOutside,"What’s your preferred casino game, 3 card poker or blackjack w/ basic strategy chart?","To further explain, the chart just gives you the best possible moves you can make in a particular situation according to your hand and the dealer’s up card. I use a chart because it is accurate and reliable, and by using it in the long run, you’ll be making a profit as it always works due to the fact that it is based on the game’s calculations of odds and probabilities. 

I used to think 3 card poker was a more high risk, high gain type of game, up until I realized by adopting another strategy, I’d win and profit in the long run. Basically how it goes is, 
Always bet 50k on ante. Don’t even bother with pair plus, the odds of getting the big bonuses are small enough, you’d lose more money through ante plus in the long run. Once cards are  handed out, don’t even look at the cards, just bet. The reason for this, is because we have the ability to win with ANY hand we get, no matter the cards. The dealer however HAS to get a queen high or higher or else they have to fold. In the case they fold, you’d still win with whatever hand you had, whenever it was a flush, or an 8 high. 

For awhile I’ve run a mix of both of the strategies mentioned above, and now have 3.3M chips. At this level, which game would I profit from in the long run, since I can now take multiple losses before my luck turns around",5,1585558509,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/frn9vo/whats_your_preferred_casino_game_3_card_poker_or/,gtaonline,1

(Zion classic) When this happened, I didn’t own a garage or even a personal vehicle. I ended up buying the cheapest $25k 2 car garage to save the car, and now have the Zion classic and the free Elegy in the garage. Did I do the right thing by buying the garage or did I just waste $25K? Also will my cars always come back since they are insured? And lastly, could I sell the garage back for money later on? Assuming a I buy an apartment with a 10 car garage, I don’t think I would use the 2 car garage.

frlntk,Eiskalter16,Idea for future update,"I have been playing gta online for about 2 years now and it's a great game with great updates each 6 months or so , but I've noticed a lot of wasted potential that could be easily fixed.
This is kinda my own idea for an update , hope u like it.
Here's an idea: The update would be some kind of sport update and lots of minigames.
Let's start , you would have two kind of properties to buy from maze bank site , gyms and restaurants , each of properties has its own deisgn (interiornand exterior) for example Up-n-atom burger , Burger shoot , cluckin bell etc.
Properties would work just like Arcades , you have business and some additional missions.
Now of course there would be a few vehicles added to the game , but each vehicle would have something that other vehicles dont have , like for example one of vehicles would have ability to put those spikes that police use to pop up player's tires etc.
Now there would be minigames and sport games , like why are there badketball and volleyball terrains in game ? Just to decorate the world? Why dont R* give them use? In this , ""imaginary"" update , you woulf be able to play more sports like basketball , volleyball and some minigames in your apartment for example cards or dominos , monopoly , why not?
Gym properties would be the same as restaurants , instead of ordering food and eating you would be able to train your character , and buičd those muscles just like in GTA SA, not only that but I would also add special training rooms to each of gyms like you would be able to train new combat skills and different combat type like box , judo ,karate etc so the comabt would be much better and unique.
Also you would be able to eat in restaurants , so if you eat healthy you will be able to build those muscles and upgrade your character's strenght or if you eat junk food you would eventualy get fat...
Just like Gta san andreas , so this could be also useful not only good or bad looking character , if yiu are strong you would deal more damage to NPCs or players , and if you are trained enough you would be ablr to dodge punches more efficiently, and if you are fat , well let's say you wouldnt be able to run as fast as trained character and couldnt dodge punches and fight as good as normal people , you would be slower , thats all.
I would also add some customization when you buy these ""new"" properties just like in Arcade , you would be able to place those working-out stuff wherever you want , the same would be for restaurants , you'd be able to place tables , and even customize them or place some machines like for popcorn or coke etc.
I'd also add some apartment customization , to be able to add your privage gym in your apartmenet.
Bugs should be patched , and that wasted potential too , for example why do we have vans when they act as same as sedans just slower , my idea is if you are sourcing 3 crates of special cargo for example and you drive van , you'd be able to take them 3 at the same time and etc . This kind of logic would be fixed , as same for all the vehicles in game , pickup also would take 2 crates max , and those flatbed truck would be able to transport cars for real etc.
I would add some mission , sell missions , upgrades for properties.
The next thing , I would add PC purpose more , like you woulf have different programs , gadgets etc.
The last thing in this update would be parkour , as I said for combat skill , if you train parkour you 'd be like a ninja , not jumoing towards roof and hitting your head just like an idiot , you would be able to do parkour just like in Gta IV and that's ir
So , this is my update idea , I know it is too much , but it's not a lot of work in my opinion, anyway hope you like the idea , and I would really want to see this one day . 🙂",1,1585549578,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/frlntk/idea_for_future_update/,gtaonline,1

However, there happened to be a rank 94 with a 1,39 KDR. He then proceeded to mock me, and, out of rage, I sold all of the aircraft in that hangar. Then, for some reason, I bought a Laser.  Needless to say, I regret it. A lot. Anyway here's a picture of my Laser and my Hydra, their colours almost identical.  Here's a list of the aircraft that previously occupied the hangar, followed by the amount of dogfights won:](https://preview.redd.it/b8egr15smqp41.jpg?width=1812&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83da2a9d7a86053776e40a17d3bc036aa02838de)

B-11 Strikeforce-4

Pyro-3

LF-22 Starling (my personal favourite)-3

Rogue-0

P-45 Nokota-2

Sea Sparrow-0

Havok-0

V-65 Molotok-0

Tula-0

Also, please note that some of these, such as the Molotok, were never used in combat situations.

frj8yd,TheCaptainRudy,Rockstar stole my fully upgraded Vigilante.,"Don't make the same mistake as me.

I bought a Comet Safari and chose my Eclipse Garage, which was already full. I was then told I'd have to replace a car with it instead.

I simply assumed that the car I replace would go into the ""STORAGE"" like with the planes in hangars. NOWHERE was it mentioned that I would COMPLETELY LOSE the car.

But then it was gone. My fully upgraded Vigilante. And that's how I paid the price of $6 million for a car worth 750k.

There were NO warnings, absolutely no information. Just a text asking you to replace. Since the system is different for hangars, I presumed it to be the same here.

I contacted Rockstar Support, and Stanley M. told me, ""Unfortunately, we cannot provide a refund for your in-game purchase.""

This is a complete rip off, $5 million is no joke, and grinding takes a lot of time and effort. Rockstar has CHEATED me.

This makes no sense, why would I ever want to REPLACE a car when buying another? Complete BS.

Obviously the afk timer kicked in and eventually I was dropped with that message stating I had been away for too long. I hit the A button and it rejoined me into the private session in my garage and without thinking I jumped straight into a mission playlist. First thing I notice is that my personal vehicle is missing. I exit out of the mission and return to mt garage, cars nnot there, I go outside and check the map, not there, I call the mechanic, not there, I call the insurance nothing, I even check to see if it had been impounded, nothing.

It seems that in the process of me be kicked for idling my personal vehicle which I bought (in game money not RL dollars) and upgraded has simply vanished without trace or explanation.

frh817,masterbxke,Y'all wanna here the most toxic story ever.,"So, it starts out in a lobby with me and one other kid. He, a level 212, not to bad in my book. Me? Just passed 400. When I entered the lobby, he was in the middle of a sightseer. I immediately hopped on my oppressor to try and kill him, since I know its an easy 14.5k. But, as soon as I spawned outside he collected the last package. So, I waste a few minutes until I can start a piracy prevention. A few minutes into it he comes to his motorcycle property on Vespucci Beach. A few minutes later he comes outside but seems to be afk, so I call Lamar and have him mugged for 10k. It turns out he was afk, so for the next ten minutes I flew on my oppressor and killed him repeatedly. I used my heavy sniper every time and got 20 headshots. After ten minutes, I call Lamar again. This time he gets robbed for 8.4k. Not a bad waste of time for 18k I'd say.

I am the most toxic player in the history of Grand Theft Auto, and I wouldn't want it any other way. I love this game more than anything.

PS. I even sent him a message telling him what I did in detail. I'm waiting for a response but I don't think I'll receive one.",11,1585530035,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/frh817/yall_wanna_here_the_most_toxic_story_ever/,gtaonline,0

frc1cq,62746271868,Open Wheel Racing League (F1) Recruiting (Xbox One),"Competitive Open Wheel Racing League Recruiting (Xbox One)

Hi Everyone, 

I am recruiting for a clean and competitive Open Wheel Racing League! Currently we have 8 of 14 spots filled and are looking to fill out the grid. The league will take place over each of the courses designed by Rockstar. Points will be tracked by the league so you won’t have to worry about bookkeeping. Teams will consist of two racers each. In order to maintain parity pairings will be determined by lap times. 

———————————————-

A few things to know: 

- Clean racing is a requirement. No one likes getting rammed when you’re trying to pass and as such that is against the rules and you will be penalized for ramming or illegal contact. 

- Prizes will be awarded for the team with the most points (two Great White Shark Cards for each driver) and for the driver with the most points (one Megaladon Shark Card). For more details about points and how points are scored please see below. 

- Custom vehicles will be allowed so you are at a distinct advantage to have one. If there are enough drivers without custom vehicles (half the grid) we will create an additional prize for the driver with the most points not in a custom PR4. This driver will get a shark card to buy his/her own PR4. 

—————————

How points work: 

- Points are awarded to the first ten finishers, with 25 for a win, 18 for second, 15 for third, then 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 for the remaining finishers of the top ten; if a driver in the top ten scores the fastest lap then they score an additional point.

———————- 

Rules to know: 


- Do not ever intentionally run into someone or bump into someone during a race. I understand that accidents happen but this server was made for people that want to race in Gta a little more competitively and test their skill, its not a demolition derby race.

fr85u8,chrissmegally,Lets discuss this! GTA event/battle,"Alright yall. I need to know if this was a dick move lol

Basically, yesterday those events were running where there are “important people” that you have to protect, and stop other people from killing them
You know the ones?

Anyways, i was running around on my feet and minding my own business, and it just so happened that i was near one of the VIP and, so, some dude with his car decides to run me over, thinking i was trying to attack

No biggy

But then, i spawn again, and hes there running me over
I didnt know this but for some reason, i couldnt blow up his car. I, in defence, tried RPGING this dude, and nothing

Eventually, he kills me 4 more times, running me over, taking advantage of the fact I couldn’t do crap
(Maybe im missing something but its my first time on GTA since like 2018)

So, i get my deluxo, equipped with everything, and hunt this dude down. 
The event ends, and roughly 7-8 times in a row, I bombarded him from the sky, missiles until he dies

He respawns, gets his car, I come from a mile away, repeating

I did this until he left the lobby

So, was it a dick move? I think that, as long as i wasn’t stopping him from an active mission, its fair game. After all, a big part of the game is sometimes starting some personal wars with others

fr6hn5,MrChrisTheDemon,CASINO HEIST MONEY GUIDE,"CASINO HEIST MONEY GUIDE

This is a guide on how to grind the casino heist effectively. You will need one friend for the finale for the end.


ADVANTAGES:
Not as repetitive as CEO crates or Import/Export
Lots of money

DISADVANTAGES:
Requires one other friend to help 



TIPS:
Use a Buzzard, Thruster, or an Oppressor MKI or II. It speeds up the setups.

Register as a CEO/VIP, not an MC President so you won't get raided.

If you have a MOC, Avenger or Terrorbyte, you can enter it to instantly lose your wanted level the setup missions (Calling Lester or using Bribe Authorities won't work). 



WHICH ARCADE TO BUY

To start the casino heist you will need an Arcade business. There are 6 in total: 1 located in Paleto. bay, 1 located in Grapeseed, and 4 of them are located in Los Santos. Obviously, the 4 ones in LS are the best. It really comes to personal preference as for which one to buy. 



PREP MISSIONS

Scops out the casino if you haven't already. Make sure to scope out the Sewer Tunnel and the Security tunnel. 

Do Vault Contents. If you get cash as loot, call. Lester to cancel heist and try again (quitting the game won't work).



CHOOSING YOUR APPROACH

Big Con is the easiest, since you can waltz right into the vault if you do the Gruppe Sechs disguises approach. Aggressive and Stealthy are harder, since you either have to shoot your way in or have to do things stealthy and avoid the cameras. I recommend doing Aggressive only if you have Artwork



CHOOSING YOUR CREW

Driver:

On all approaches,  choose Karim (5% cut). You don't need great vehicles to escape the casino

Gunman:

On Big Con and Stealthy, choose the worst gunman (5% cut). You don't really need great guns since you don't need great guns for this approach.

On Aggressive, choose Packie McReary (7% cut) . You can unlock him in a random event.

Hacker:

If you're looting Diamonds or Gold, choose Paige (9% cut) If you're looting Paintings, choose Christian (7% cut). Make sure to leave the vault before the timer ends in Big Con or Stealthy approach so you don't alert the guards. For aggressive, you can stay in the vault for a she longer to finish looting after the nerve agent is released. You won't take that much damage. You'll also regenerate in the man trap.



WHICH OPTIONAL SETUPS SHOULD YOU DO?

Big Con:

You won't need any optional setups for this approach. Here's why. You won't be engaged in any gunfight as long as you don't set off the alarm. You will only need to hack 1 door, so security passes are unnecessary. Exit disguises are not worth the time. You can avoid the staff easily when escaping. However, if you're bad at stealth, get the High Roller disguise by collecting 54 playing cards.

Aggressive:

Do the Boring Machine setup so you can enter though the sewer tunnels. Do reinforced armour if you're bad at fighting enemies. Make sure to do Duggan Shipments, since you'll be fighting a lot of enemies. Lastly, masks. Masks will be provided for you, so you won't have to go buy masks. 

Silent and Sneaky:

This approach requires the most preps. Do Patrol Routes and Security Intel so you can avoid being spotted. Do Lvl 2 security passes as you have to hack 3 doors. Lastly, do Duggan Shipments, as some of the guards wear helmets that have crazy protection.


HEIST FINALE

So after all the setup missions, you've finally reached the Heist Finale. Do not bother with the Clean Vehicles or the Gunman Decoy, they are useless. When escaping, if your getaway vehicle is really far, steal a civilian vehicle instead, it is much faster. After that, to lose the cops, you can drive into the sewers to lose the cops or you can take a helipoter in the nearby police station. MAKE SURE TO NEVER DRIVE NEAR THE CASINO AFTER YOU LOSE THE COPS, OR YOU WILL GET YOUR WANTED LEVEL BACK. Always choose the highest level buyer.

fr68yq,help4demographics,What should I upgrade next?,"What should I upgrade and spend my money on?

I own CEO, special cargo (small), vehicle warehouse, MOC; cocaine fully upgraded, document forgery - closed down - counter fit money, bunker (fully upgraded) night club ( no upgrades, hanger, arcade and facility.

Have 700k in the bank.

I also own a terrabyte and oppressor mark 1. TB is not upgraded at all nor is MK1.

I basically earn money by buying stock once for my coke and bunker and then sell when it’s full from the 75k stock I bought. I then sell high end cars from my warehouse and while I’m waiting I’ll do the bank robbery from the terrabyte.

I’ve never done any of the facility peeps, and I’m ready to go with the casino heist big con.

I cannot decide what I should do now? Should I own all MOC businesses so they earn me money in my nightclub? What about fully upgrading the nightclub and buying more storage floors? I just leave the counterfeit money and never bother to get supplies for it as it doesn’t seem worth it. I shut the forgery down as it seemed a waste. Not sure if I should buy meth and weed farm?

I have no vehicles of use either. I think I’ll buy the avenger next as it’s very cheap, has a cheap vehicle workshop on sale and will help me get around the map.

Any suggestions would be great.

fr2olu,No0b_MoDe_On,A quick tip to end 'Unable to Connect' error when joining a friend's session.,"Hope this helps:)

I see a lot of players getting the error 'unable to connect' when joining a friend's GTA Online session. So here is a quick tip to smoothly join a session with your friend.

**This works for -**

1. Unable to connect error
2. Timed out session error
3. Session does not exist error

**Steps -**

So close your game.

Then restart it but go to story mode. DO NOT go straight to online from loading screen. 

Then pause the game and go to online section.

Then choose Go To Online.

From there, choose invite only session.

This step is really important. As invite only session will not pair you with others. You will only play with those whom you invite.

Make sure your friend also do the same.

Then either you invite your friend or your friend invites you.

**To invite-**

First pause the game.

Then go to friends section.

Choose the friend you want to invite.

Then choose Send Game Invite option.

**To accept the invite -**

Pause the game.

Then go to friends section.

Choose the friend who sends you the invite.

Choose Accept Game Invite.

And it will warn you about leaving your game. Accept it and you will spawn in your friend's session where there will be no other player.",1,1585470661,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fr2olu/a_quick_tip_to_end_unable_to_connect_error_when/,gtaonline,1

fr02gu,ProzacAndHoes,Why do people dislike glitched or hacked money,"So I am a very casual gta player. I made a ton of money of horse races when the casino first came out and invested it all into properties and upgrades. I made about 64 mil from horse races and spent about 45 in properties and about 19 on an avenger, pyro, terrorbyte, MOC, Deluxo, and a nightclub. In that time I’ve made like 15 million from working about 100 sales from my nightclub in about 3 months of play and that astonished me. If I were to legitimately have made my money that would’ve been years of work for nothing  of real value doing menial peon tasks hours a day. 

With that said rockstar also charges outrageous prices on shark cards. No need to delve deeper into that one

So then there are money drops where you can make about 5 mil in an hour? I think it’s pretty stupid and unfair to those who are legit, but I mean come on could you blame someone if they just casually play and want to drive a F1 car they can get 5 mil so they can just enjoy the free mode rp aspects of the game?

fqzu6x,Ya_Boi_Mozzie,[ADVICE] The Avenger is pretty good,"I’ve recently bought the avenger for the sale price and I can say that it is definitely worth it. It’s not worth it’s base price, but it’s current sale price is a steal. If you’re considering buying it, it’s really worth it. The explosive cannons are INCREDIBLY good for securing an area from above, and it’s enhanced by having friends to shoot while you drive or vice versa. It’s vehicle modification station is nice. Sure, you can’t bring normal cars in, but if you have an oppressor (MK1), it pairs almost perfectly. On top of all this, it’s really fun to fly, and handles considerably well compared to some other planes. Obviously, it isn’t as good as a jet in agility, but it’s terrific when compared to planes with similar functions such as the bombushka or the Tula. It’s armor is really good, though it’s rotor blades to appear to be weak points. So far, my only complaint is that you can’t easily get in once you jump out if you leave it on autopilot. All in all, if you’re on the fence about buying this, it’s a really good idea and you probably won’t regret it",8,1585456153,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fqzu6x/advice_the_avenger_is_pretty_good/,gtaonline,1

fqza0p,ChefJerfey,"Just out of curiosity,what's your opinion on glitching to make money?","I know there's differing opinions, I'm just interested in your take on it

Personally, I was never a glitcher (at first). I made all my money by grinding. I made over $130 million in the game &amp; eventually just got tired of it. I spent all my time grinding &amp; hardly ever enjoying the fruits of my labor. I've always been a car guy so one day I just stopped grinding &amp; started going to car meets instead (since I mainly grinded in the Oppressor &amp; Deluxo before). Since I own all the businesses &amp; whatnot, my money kept getting drained faster than I could make it. So I just said ""screw it"", googled the car duplication glitch, then started duplicating a bunch of Future Shock Issi's

I've made a good $80 million from it over time, but it's still not even half of what I made from actually grindng

I know some people in the sub are grinders who hate glitchers, some are glitchers that hate/don't have time for grinding. But I'm just a grinder who turned glitcher.

I think it would be cool if when we host the friend or crew only sessions we had an option to enable the director mode thus disabling money gain and xp gain for lobby sessions, but allowing any player that joins to load in as any of the character models from the game, and also allows the host to use the director mode Settings such as: turning off the cops (good for rp), turning on invincibility for an individual or all players, flaming bullets, etc. Could even add an option to allow the players to use their phones to dial in cheats from single player.

As the inevitable release of GTA VI grows closer I just feel this would be a nice parting gift for the console players of GTA V who have been here for so long (some of us since the beginning) and would be a nice way to boost the community.",3,1585451173,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fqynhz/director_mode_settings_in_multiplayer_private/,gtaonline,1

fqykgj,TheBullGat0r,The bunker isn't really worth it,"I've found that you really should just buy an office instead. The bunker requires either 75,000 or 3-4 decent to hard difficulty ressuplies to be full. After that, even with all the upgrades, it still takes 2+ hours of active game time get through all the supplies, and that only gets you like 150,000. And then there's the cost of just the bunker. The lowest cost for a good location bunker is chumash, which is 1.65 million. And on top of all that, if you are a solo, (I am) there is a cap of money per sell you can make before there are two or three vehicles which makes it harder if not impossible.

The office on the other hand is less cost and more profit. The cheapest office, Maze Bank West, is 1 million. With a cheap office, you would expect some sort of catch. But no. It has a good view, and just so happens to be right across the street from my house, Del Perro Heights, high end and cheap. It's also pretty close to missions for the office. You can buy a garage of you want, which is pretty cheap for all the cars it can hold. The business of the office is pretty cheap as well. Special Cargo: 250,000 for the cheapest, and 400k I believe for the highest warehouse. Vehicle cargo gets a ton more expensive but can be worth it as well. I have only done special cargo. A small warehouse can hold up to 16 cargo, medium around 40 something, and large in the 100s.  

You can buy up to 3 special cargo crates at a time, 1 for 2000, 2 for 10000, and 3 for 18000. These send you on easy to medium difficulty cargo missions. Once you get the crates you can immediately sell them for 36,000 for 3. 81,000 for 6. And 124,000 for 9. This is the maximum before you get more than 1 vehicle. 18k for 3 crates times three is 54k. 124-54 is a net profit of 70k. The instant ability to sell with no wait immediately makes it better for grinding. While yes, the bunker does make marginally more before 1 vehicle, the wait plus the cost of 75k per supplies for the bunker pretty much invalidates the advantage of the bunker. You can make more money in less time, with less cost, if you buy an office instead. You also get infinite snacks and storage for a helicopter from an office. Just buy an office instead of a bunker.

Everytime im in a session there is ALWAYS griefers, like ALWAYS. You CANNOT do anything productive in a public session, it is simply impossible most of the times. Not only that, just now I had someone kill me over and over, even going as far as screenshotting the kill message and sending it to me on PS. He didnt stop there though, when I blocked him he had his crew send me messages. Im sorry, but what the fuck is wrong with people?  
I blame rockstar a little bit. They gave us Oppressors and Hydras, which is basically a recipe for griefing. This community will never change. I know there is a lot of nice people, but for a fella just trying to sell their product or simple cruise around the city only to be obliterated over and over by a cocky selfish prick on an oppressor, this game is a living hell.

You need to spend so much time everyday and at the end its not enjoyable.
I been grinding alone which is worse and boring, because every time I try to form a group to help each other out they just disconnect, don’t try to help or just do what they want.
Griefers, oh. fucking. God. If I’m exporting a vehicle that is valued 100k for me and destroying it costs a lot of money and the reward is 1-2K, that means that it is impossible to someone to try to do it right? Well you are totally *WRONG* There’s going to be this person that thinks, “YoU KnOW WhAt, It WOuLd Be FunNy To DesTroy ThIs Guy HoURS OF WOrk” and there they go with a fucking depressor MK 2 and destroy the Car/bunker weapons/special cargo/Mc business/hangar shipments so +20 hours of of working andplaying go to be fucking *erased*.

I try to have people so we can help each other easily, but I just have 2 friends to play and 1 of them doesn’t speak English so it’s hard to communicate and the other one doesn’t respond messages, everytime I see people looking for groups it’s either for Rp, modded cars exchange or asking for modded money.",19,1585447496,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fqxpwc/im_so_done_with_this_game/,gtaonline,1

The entire Supercars class has now been added to the reference. This update honestly feels like the fastest turn around for any category. But, this update proved to be quite difficult due to the absence of publicly available manufacturer paint codes to base off of for the reference. But with that being said, I will return to this and other sections to update it if any new information is found. 

Now the Sports Classics class is up next on the list and it's currently in progress. This update might take a bit due to the fact that some cars are from the turn of the century and might not have   
 standardized paint records and recent real world events of a certain pesky bug. It'll be fun none the less.

Vehicles I need help finding sources for the following: 

* Commercial class
* Planes class
* Helicopters class 
* Vagner (found the names but not the matching colors)
* Blazer (and variants excluding Aqua)
* Hellion
* Akuma
* Gargoyle (includes Deathbike)
* Enduro
* Esskey

Any help would be appreciated!

We will meet at the airfield (because its an open area). Make sure your car is on all doors open and the access is on passenger, (therefore if you upgraded the front engine by looks people can see it, also if someone wants to see the interior they can get in and go in first person. both of these can be turned on by holding the big button in the middle, then going to vehicles.) At the end we will all race. This will happen tomorrow around 3 pm EST. My PSN is ReverseKobe, make sure that when you friend me to make the message say im here for the car show.

fqul8d,steakandwater,"Just a reminder to new players that 2.45 million is free for the taking in this game, and another another ~4 million of useful items for cheap","Starting out, immediately pair with twitch prime (if you have amazon prime, twitch prime is free) and enable 2 factor authentication. This right here is 1.75 million for free, wired into your account over the next few days

Next, there’s 3 treasure hunts. The easiest is the stone hatchet, you just pick it up and you get the axe, do 25 kills and you get 250k. This is easy because while using the axe you get like 10 seconds of something similar trevor’s ability, plus it fills up half way every next kill. You should be able to get about 10 free kills with this active in a population dense area, then just repeat a few times

From there, the double action and navy revolvers give 250k and 200k respectively for finishing their treasure hunts. All the guides are posted online.

This alone is 2.45 million but the criminal enterprise starter pack is 9 dollars, just don’t order Uber eats one time and you basically paid for it. It’s the cheapest of all the in game purchases. You get a million, a ceo office, an MC club, bunker, and cash factory

Aside from that you get the turismo and a few bikes for free. Everything else kind of sucks unless you just especially like the way they look.

That’s like 6.5 million worth of money and in game items for under 10 bucks, if you immediately start grinding you can get a deluxe or oppressor mkii in a week just buy upgrading your bunker and business maximally (it’ll cost around 2 million) and then buying shipments and delivering them in your truismo or a motorcycle

I’m giving this advice because I followed this path of doing the enterprise pack and the treasure hunts and twitch prime and all from a fresh account (I’ve played a lot on a different one) and it severely hurt me when I started buying and modding cars at benny’s etc.

If you’re gonna buy something buy a Karuma or duke o death, I’ve got both and they make doing freemode missions easy.",13,1585436128,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fqul8d/just_a_reminder_to_new_players_that_245_million/,gtaonline,6

fqs55u,pedopis,Was battling 3 guys after they killed me for no reason and they started hacking.," Two randoms and I were hanging around in a store when we got deleted (as in, killed) by a squad of 3-4 players who where riding in an armored truck (cant recall which one, all i noticed was that it had a turret and had desert camo paint). I took it as personal, and started killing them along with the other two randoms who decided to join me in the quarrell. We were playing fair, until one of the guys of the squad we were going against left the game. That's when three very suspicious events occurred: One, i was randomly blown up and killed. After i respawned, i was blown up a couple times, although the explosions were not deadly and had this weird ""Atomic Blimp"" blue balloon effect under them. Finally, my player froze, and i was sent to the campaign mode shortly afterwards. The ""campaign kick"" and the random explosion occurred to both of the other randoms (They are speaking spanish in the video, but one of them expresses his surprise about being kicked to campaign mode at 0:51 in the video, and the other one says he was randomly blown up and killed at 0:59, not sure about the full sentences as im not spanish and the two of them were together). While not evidenced in the video, the  player who left the session mentioned before was seen spawning a Bombushka aeroplane on the highway in front of the casino before leaving. The player names were:  VinniK\_, ErrorSystemZ and Kebabcici45.

fqs4iq,aoTRIFORCE,Poll - Missions suited for solo players,"This has been a thread for a long time, being a solo player in GTA 5 has always it's issues. Selling most of the time for almost no profit to loss of money, dealing with griefers destroying one of the three trucks you need to use to deliver 15 packages, dealing also with the long runs and running out of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think we need to adapt missions to solo players so instead of having three trucks they have only one to use and deliver. This can be seen as delivering bigger packages and so bigger transaction if you want to explain the logic behind it. I hardly make a profit and i'm trying hard, mostly because of griefers wich is a majority of poeple. Some poeple would say you need to go in an empty lobby and do your missions, but even then, time is also a problem in those missions when you have to make 10 miles to deliver 15 packages all across the area.

The things I am considering:

- I don't do much pvp so I really dont care whether it haa countermeasures or not but I really prefer good missiles.

-Speed. Can both of these vehicles complete duggan shipments solo?

- accessesbility. There is a 5m cooldown on oppressor mk2 while it is only around 90 secs with deluxo.


- Fun. Which one is more fun overall?

fqqh4t,Gaming_Hour,Be careful with those 3 hackers,"I entered in a lobby in wich everything was exploding for no reason. I was traveling on the opressor mk2 and, for no reason, I jumped out of  the vehicle (without pressing anything), and then, I exploded in the air.  The worst thing is that the hackers froze my game 3 times and sent me to the campaing.  My brother was playing with me and he had the same issue. The hackers were 3 players with godmode that I recorded. Their names were:

1: ""VinniK\_*"" 2: ""ErrorSystemZ*"" 3:  ""Kebabcici45""

Be careful because they could make things like kill a lot of people in the name of other (the game displayed that my brother killed 14 players, but he was in the casino LOL, this is dangerous bc you can be banned for harassment and your mental can be perjudicated).

The best part of this is that I searched them on steam and... they were Vacbaned and blocked from multiple games, so they are 100% hackers.

&amp;#x200B;

Most important parts of the video: 00:00 the hackers. everyones jump out of the vehicle and explodes (my brother exploded too, I suppose everyone in the server). 01:17 im sent to campaing.

Today I went to see my psychiatrist as usual except today was different. He asked me what my greatest fears are in life, therefore, I swiftly responded with, “the MK 2 oppressor.” 

He looked at me with a blank face and abruptly said, “what’s that?” Which led me to have to explain to him what it is and it’s significance in the game. 

He just responded with, “oh ok.” And proceeded to change the subject.

2.NO, it does not work in freemode. (Except the helmet i think)
3. YES, its only equippable on heists if you have it on a saved outfit
4. NO, you cant sprint in it, NO sprinting is not better to have
5. YES, people can only choose it if heist clothing is set by the host to "" player saved outfits""

First idea for me is that the game would have an idea of how good of a sport you are using the commend feature, bad sport points, etc. and if you are an exceptionally good sport it will send invites to players accept the highest percent of invites

Secondly, by selecting quick job in online menu or responding to a phone job invite from a stranger (within the first few seconds), the game should give you a bonus.

In a normal jobs and setups that would mean 1.5x cash and double RP. For a heist a bonus only occurs from a phone invite, not just joining a job, and it warrants a 10% bonus that doesn’t come out of the leaders cut.

Fourth, make public hosting unlockable after having successfully done 20 total of that category of job. This means either solo grinding/inviting xbox friends, OR joining other sessions to unlock hosting

Lastly, good sports get matched with people with higher win rates on contact missions and heists. That way, if you’re doing a heist, if you’re a helpful player you’ll be more likely to get an effective crew. You can pay a 30k fee to unlock a category if you don’t want to grind

So in other words, a good sport will send invites from auto invite to people with like 50% invite acceptance rates and maybe 95% completion rates for heists and contact missions

A bad sport however might only invite people who very rarely accept invites, and might have to rely on the open matchmaking to find partners. When people do join, they will be ones with higher fail rates.



**TL;DR**

* Encourages good freemode behavior so that you can get prioritized in matchmaking processes

* Speeds up matchmaking for helpful players

* Makes good players join quick jobs of helpful players

* Makes bad players join missions of griefers

* Gives bonus money for people that join jobs quick rather than hosting their own

* Low level players are less likely to host and more likely to join since it has to be unlocked",6,1585354580,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fq9civ/improvement_of_matchmaking_suggestions/,gtaonline,1

fq9946,Luciferreap,Heavy sniper mk3,"Here is my concept on a heavy sniper mk3 and what it could be made into leave comments, questions or suggestions below

So the idea would be a anti vehicle heavy sniper, it would have a lock on to valuable parts of the vehicles which u can change with different pad to switch parts

On planes 

On planes u can target 
Jet engines 
Properller 
It will cause them to stop running and smoke 
Has a chance to restart back up 

On helicopters

You can lock onto 

Weapons 
U can lock onto the machine guns or misses disabling there use

Rear router 
Causing them to lose control 

On cars/trucks 
U can lock onto 
Engine 
Causing vehicle to stall possible restart up

Tires 
When shot will cause the rim to Come off the car 

When available 
Nos
Making it so u can't activate Nos or shunt 
Weapons making it so u can't fire 

Mines 
Making it so you can't drop mines for a current amount of time 

Oppressors 1 n 2 
Would lock onto 

Wheels in the mk 1

On both it would lock onto the 

Engine 
. 
And 
Booster making them both stall or unusabled

Against players 

Will not lock on to actually body 
Only does 1/4 damage against a player half if a head shot 

It can't lock onto any business cargo ranging from ceo to motercycle it can lock onto enemy npcs vehicles 

Firing 

Now people are gonna look at this weapon and go this is over powered by it has to be fired when on the bipod which u have to be near a hood of a vehicle or a low setting wall or something you can set up for full lock on abilities if you wanna fire not on the bipod it limits the lock on range to half 

Will take a few seconds to fire in between shots due to being a bolt action 

May take a few shots to disable depending in armor level of vehicle 

( bullet proof Tires are effected by weapon due to target the full rim )


Capacity  
The magazine size for this gun would be 10 bullets in the magazine 15 if you buy the extended magazine upgrade 
You then have a capacity of 2 thosand rounds 

Range 

On bipod the sniper would have the range of 8 city blocks 

While free aiming you will have half of the range while On bipod so only 4 blocks 

Upgradable 


Magazine 

The upgrade for the gun would be a extended magazine would would increase magazine from 10 to 15 bullets 

Barrel 

You can purchase a heavy barrel which will increase the chance of the vehicle not being able to come out of a stall 

Muzzles

Stock muzzle will be like the normal sniper rifle where it just ends

Muzzle break will be like a berret muzzle which will increase stopping power in case vehicle has armor 

Suppressor for when doing stealth missions npcs are less likely to notice 

Tints 
Livery 

The mk 3 will have all the same liverys and tints as the mk 2 

Bipod 
You Will be able to purchase diffrent color and designs of bipods for cosmetic purposes 

Price 
The price for the mk 3 would be 
From stock 400 grand 

But if you already have a heavy sniper mk2  it would only cost 200 grand to upgrade into a mk 3",8,1585354237,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fq9946/heavy_sniper_mk3/,gtaonline,1

Since you obviously failed at detecting modders (funnily, modders can detect other modders) why don't you monitor lobbies manually? Why don't you hire the developers of the mods so that they can help you with that? Why are you refusing to do anything?

Freemode is cancer right now.

An unpunished modder is someone that everybody aspire to emulate, because if they don't, they will get their ass kicked by a modder. ""Hey, that dude is a modder and they are in charge here, therefore I will be a modder too, since I won't get punished either.""

The reason I ask is my group has started to take formation driving to defend our supplies. (not tight formations but tight enough to catch lock-ons without one death having casualties) This works quite nicely on nearly every lock-on system as when one hears a lock they let everyone know and we can take out the offending player quickly enough. (I'm honestly amazed how many people still target you when your running in groups of 5 and up and how many try and start mini wars when they are solo and you can just turn and take them out repeatedly for messing with your group)  
Anyway back on point.  


So our group was doing this when suddenly out of nowhere we all hear lock-on beeping and see one guy in an Oppressor 2 flying at us shooting rockets like he was in a flying Chernobog. His missiles locked onto each of us and killed us basically all at the same time.  
This shouldn't be possible right? Or if your quick enough can you somehow spam rockets at different targets in the Oppressor 2?  


For the follow up sub question, we then went to war against him (as you do) and after learning that his Oppressor 2 isnt as good as five guys with practically every gun in the game, he then tried his Terrorbyte...which he learned doesnt protect him at all and can be blown up. Then he got into his RC Tank. This thing drained all of us of our ammo (admittedly the Terrorbyte did to but we all had several rockets and grenades left) is it possible to blow it up, if so how many shots does it take?",4,1585343646,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fq5x67/how_fast_is_the_oppressor_2_able_to_fire_its/,gtaonline,1

I have a decent amount of supercars, most of the weapons, a high end apartment, second garage, a weed farm, pretty sure I'm a CEO as well.

There's just so much in this game that it's overwhelming. I have about 700k right now. Could someone point me in the right direction and give me a sort of ""road map"" or objectives I should be striving for? How do I become a VIP and gain access to those missions, as I've heard the repo stuff for simeon is a pretty good money maker. Also, how do I access my ""business"" thing or whatever it is that I bought when I became a CEO? Totally forgot most of the shit in this game tbh lol.

fq2grc,ThatRangerDave,To the tryhard modders. You are sad,"You can’t brag about “skill” or score when you use godmode in a fight. Seriously, you make me laugh. Saying 3-0 means f-all when you aren’t playing fair. Using full auto explosive SMGs isn’t skill.  Teleporting and blowing someone up by RPGing yourself isn’t skill. Stop trying to brag about it. 


After 6 years of this game, the stupidity of tryhards and griefers still has no limit. 


One tip for fighting someone in godmode.  run over them with the RC tank or bandito so they can’t get up. (Or use a water cannon.) Make them rage. 
If a modder is killing you using explosions, go into passive to make them ignore you. It’s much harder to kill a player if they’re in passive mode. Even if you are a modder, you’d have to use the game engine itself to kill a passive player. 

Another tip, use job invites to get around the map and away from modders and griefers. This is especially useful if they trap you in a cage and you can’t EWO. It also makes it so you don’t take a death or have to leave the session. (Not that dying should matter, it’s a bloody game for F-sakes. )",39,1585333550,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fq2grc/to_the_tryhard_modders_you_are_sad/,gtaonline,0

They never accept any other way of playing apart from how *they* want to play the game. They'll never understand what it feels like to really play GTA. They're not criminals anymore, they're delivery drivers. They spend all day doing sales in solo lobbies (which is cheating) so they can earn some petty cash.

And why do they suck off The Professional? My word is he annoying. All these grinders do regurgitate his shitty opinions which have no reasoning behind them - ""Let us sell in solo lobbies"" ""You can't destroy carg0"" ""gwiefer bad!!!!"". It's such an unrealistic and selfish view on the game. You're not the only people playing, you can't always have it your way.

fpzw1c,Colin9941,[PS4] TRUE REAPER // Military Crew // Recruiting,"True Reaper is recruiting on PS4 we're one of the most organized military based crews within GTA with 63 members and growing.

To join the crew there will be a friendly 1v1 between you and a crew member of your choice (preferably around your level). You also get to choose the location at which the 1v1 will take place. The rules of the 1v1 are:

It will be first one to 10 points, the challenger must get a minimum of 7 to get into the crew. 
There is no vehicles allowed.
No CEO or MC.
No explosives or special ammo.
No laser weapons or miniguns.
You may only kill yourself after you score a point to get rid of cops etc. 

Crew Rules:

1. No crew killing (accidental kills or killing each other as a joke must be paid back or at least offered)

2. Keep our tag active at all times.

3. If there is 3 or more of us in a lobby we have a uniform this rule mainly applies if I'm in the session. Reason for this is it makes it easier to tell who's who if one of us is off radar and it makes us look as organized for videos and/or during combat hopefully pulling in new members.

4. Only permitted members can add recruits to the crew. 

5. If your social club name does not match your PSN inform us.

To join the crew send a friend request with a message to CanuckInCombat. Friend requests without messages will not be accepted.

fpzk17,PyroJuice1,Why was I banned but blatant hackers are still rampant?,"Preface: I was permanently banned this morning. The previous night I was playing with friends and messing with a script injector to give myself large amounts of cash. I'm not looking to plead innocence to rockstar and get unbanned, in the end, they got me and that's my fault.

Now for the main question: Over my time playing gtaV online (before I was banned) I have encountered blatant hackers (shooting fire from the mouth, flying, rainbow color changing cars, causing everyone else on the map to explode, spawning exorbitant amounts of cargo planes, etc.). So from the way that I see it what I was doing is a relatively minor offense compared to some other people. So what causes someone like me who is only using cheats to get cash to get banned versus a lvl 8000 player breathing fire with a rainbow farting khanjali turning everyone else in the lobby into a weed plant. Is it a paid mod menu vs a free one (I used a free one), or do those players get banned too but we just don't notice it because so many people do it (I'd say 1 in every 3 lobbies has a blatant griefer/hacker).",21,1585325053,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fpzk17/why_was_i_banned_but_blatant_hackers_are_still/,gtaonline,0

It seems to me that this would be the time to have the most awesome 1.5x and double money activities in the game and the best stuff on sale.

This would be great outreach to their fans who are stuck at home and turn to their games for entertainment, and it would be a great marketing opportunity for themselves to tout their sales and events as community outreach.

I mean, the sales and activities these last couple of weeks haven't been *bad* per say, but they are just regular business as usual weekly sales.

In the same moment i enter the car (2:30am), I got a message of a 30 day ban (till 24 March). Ok, I had nothing to lost, but it is frustrating bought a game and can't play it for 1 month.


I get unbanned 24 March and start playing in that day. Today, 12pm, I bought the worst apartment (I got enough money) and in the moment i enter in, got a message of permanent ban.

In the 30 day ban, i contacted Rockstar Support and they do not help. I contacted this time too, but i guess they will don't help.

What can I do? Please help me! I don't have money to buy another game.

fpx2oq,-REXIA-,Carbine Rifle is the best rifle in PvE and here’s why,"1v1 wise, the Special Carbine hands down. But Carbine Rifle (M4 looking one) works super well with the Aim Assist Full because every time you lock on to an enemy kill him then relock to the next enemy by tilting left or right on the R analog stick while firing, it automatically aim at their heads EVERYTIME. While other rifles will always relock to the next target on the chest area. Also recoil wise it’s not as good as Special Carbine but it has one hell of an accuracy and range. When I test both rifle against the wall, the  SC has small spread while CR has more a vertical line. You can easily mowed down 10 enemy NPCs with the CR in under 5 seconds.",6,1585316298,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fpx2oq/carbine_rifle_is_the_best_rifle_in_pve_and_heres/,gtaonline,1

fpv57s,R--U--B--Y,Heists are cancer.,"This isn’t really a problem that can be fixed, more of a tirade that you may be able to relate to. So the first part is loading it up and right off the bat there’s at least one guy who wants more than their default take. Now most of the time I’ll give people twenty percent right? Well not when the setups take almost two to three hours to complete. So you gotta wait through three lobbies or more until you finally get three people or two or one whatever who are finally complicit in your selfishness, or cheapness whichever way you look at it. Then it’s time to load up the heist. Nobody’s got a mic, maybe at best one guy does. The chance of a full mic lobby is the same chance of April being a good month. People fuck up on the easiest parts never the hardest. Casino heist for example, I had a guy start shooting the guards once we got down to the basement level on big con. Most morons don’t know how to hack even the fucking fingerprint thing and a dog could probably figure it out faster than some of these people. I understand people dying that doesn’t get on my nerves really but leavers... Jesus. If mom’s calling tell her to fuck off cause I don’t wanna lose twenty minutes of my very important and critical video game progress for your dinner time or shitty internet!

fptqkj,haydenz23,Rockstar hates me,"Hey guys. Little Story / Rant for you

So I just got the cocaine lockup, and it was nearly full. I had stayed up until 5am to sell this thing. My buddy and I launch the sell mission, for $270,000. We got the post vans, and I thought ""meh, I got a buddy helping me so I should be able to deliver it in the 30 minute window no problem"".

So about 5/14 deliveries in, the facetime call glitches, and the game seems fine. All the sudden, my friend timed out. For me, It said he left, and vice versa. I started freaking out, as this van was so damn slow and I wasn't going to be able to make the deliveries. We have been grinding all week and not once has this happened before, and it literally happened at the worst time possible.

Worse. damn. timing. ever.

Back in 2016, I installed a modmenu and I gave me almost everything (On PS3), and obviously I got banned (I forgot how long).
The thing is that a week later, my parents gifted me the PS4 with GTA 5. The first thing I made was transfering my account, and when I did it, everything was fine... except of my money.

I had 530million$, and when I transfered it, I had almost 0$, but when my brother transfered his account (he also got banned), he received his 77million dollars.

4 years ago I'm asking if there's any way to recover the money I lost.",0,1585286450,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fpradk/is_there_any_way_to_recover_the_money_i_lost/,gtaonline,1

fpr1g1,TheDeputyDude,Griefers and children,"Today I joined an MC to help a dude Resupply and sell. We were coming down to LS around the Pacific bank when I made a turn and got gunned down. I'll be calling this guy ""Shorty"". Me and Shorty had a back and forth until I fucked off. I got a armored car of supplies and took it to the business. We did two more resupplies and kept following us and messing with us, he even got my ride impounded. I eventually texted him asking why he was being a dickhead. All he said was ""chumpz"". After the strenuous act of making a single word he decided to hibernate in one of his properties. 

We started another resupply and all of a sudden, as if by the will of some masochistic God, some of the most distorted, trashy, and low effort trap music blares through a microphone most likely from the first world war. Me and another biker were riding until we were gifted temporary flight by a blue and chrome sports car. I fall and it stops, a black man with blue dreads, no shirt, and red pants sees a girl getting off the pavement and decides to end her suffering with his entire drum.

I respawn and equip my mic, I tell him to kindly fuck off, and then I hear what can only be described as that kid in kindergarten who ate the glue tell me I'm trash. I get into a roasting session with him. And that's when the game disconnected.

fpqoh2,ChristopherJak,Looks like you can survive the nerve gas in the casino heist for around 30 seconds before you die/need snacks.,"This is one thing I've been really curious to know but have found difficult to find a straight answer, but by looking at these guys heist, https://youtu.be/2GgPKWdlKCc?t=500

* 8:21 counter reached 0
* 8:30 gas started to do damage
* 8:46 the guy starts to snack himself up when he had about 1/3rd of his hp remaining. 

Assuming 1/3rd is correct, he could have lasted another 8~ seconds before dying. Placing the entire survival time at 33~ seconds from the count of 0.

Of course, none of this takes into account the various quirks of GTA, for example the time could be less if he hadn't started lotting just prior. Also if host was CEO, I believe his mates also regain a slight amount of HP?

Anyone got anything they like to add or contest? I'm looking for as much useful info as I can get &amp; I don't see enough sharing the useful specifics.

One other thing I'd like to know that comes to mind is: In the Big Con, with the Noose(or even high roller) exit disguise, could you take the daily takings without alerting the guards? I'd assume no(it's also probably not worth sacrificing the Elite challenge), but you never know what may have been overlooked in such a big game.",2,1585283514,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fpqoh2/looks_like_you_can_survive_the_nerve_gas_in_the/,gtaonline,1

fplrdt,jokwax,Driving with a steering wheel,"tl;dr can I use simple functions like speed and steering in a plug&amp;play(no mods) manner with gta online using a steering wheel.  


With schools being closed I've really thrown myself onto this game once more and while I always liked the action parts of this game I have finally fallen victim to the driving and flying aspects of the game. I'll drive around in my cars with no destination for hours.

I remember seeing an old post from someone who said that using a steering wheel improved their driving enjoyment a lot so I considered getting one too but before I commit to the 300 euro price tag I wanted to make sure that it works with this game so I'm asking if anyone else has one and how well it works.

I'm not looking for anything fancy like transmission mods etc, I'm just wondering if I can use the steering wheel and paddles purely like I would use a controller, plug &amp; play. Just steering and acceleration. 

I used to drive with a keyboard and switching to a controller for that was a big upgrade as I could now control my turns better as well as my speed. If I could improve this even more by using a steering wheel I could enjoy the game a lot more.",0,1585263963,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/fplrdt/driving_with_a_steering_wheel/,gtaonline,1

Inside the Network is a framework for pure RP or story telling, allowing for people to stay the same or have arcs that change the fundamentals of who they are. It goes as deep as you want it to. Hopefully we can see you on the streets whatever decision you make.
