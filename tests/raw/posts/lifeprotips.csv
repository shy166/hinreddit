I know many people are applying for State assistance, Unemployment Insurance benefits, etc. It is not much of a discount, but it will help. Your membership rate will be reduced to $5.99/month versus the current rate of $12.99/month. (For Student info read last paragraph).

‚Ä¢Your EBT card will not be used to pay for your membership.

‚Ä¢Note:¬†You will need to qualify every 12 months for up to 48 months.

‚Ä¢This monthly offer does not include household sharing of Prime benefits.

To apply it is a few easy steps. 
1.Enter your EBT number
Select your issuing State from the dropdown 
2. Upload an image of your EBT Card
Check the ""I confirm my EBT card is current and valid"" 
Click continue. 


I find this information very helpful to those who are unable to leave their home, have an immunocompromised family member and do not want to risk going out into the general public right now. Right now to some people $7.00 extra means a lot. Wanted to share. 

If you do not qualify for this rate but are a College Student you will qualify for the Student Rate. That is $6.49/month but currently they are offering a 6 month free trial courtesy of Sprint. You will need to provide your University name, Your name/date of birth and graduation date, followed up with a school email address ending in the 'dot' edu.

I also cannot forget our phenomenal members. Without their continued support, many of us would also be in the unemployment line.

I‚Äôm not a nurse or a doctor, and I do not make a ton of money to donate to the wonderful causes that are out there right now helping our greater American family get through this; but what I can continue to do is to support businesses, such as The Claremont Club, that are taking care of their employees and I would ask all of you to do the same.

Thank you to Mike, the Management Team our Board and most of all our members for treating me as family. You are taking care of me now, and I will work my hardest to take care of you when this is finally over.

fsff4c,detective-briscoe,LPT - Snagging a rental in a competitive market,"
This trick has worked wonders for me twice now. I live in Los Angeles which has many ‚Äútrendy hipstery up and coming‚Äù neighborhoods that are extremely desirable to live in. Anytime going to any showing you‚Äôre there with like 10 to 15 other people also talking to their partner about where the headboard should go. It‚Äôs nerve racking!

A trick I have used twice now and has helped me immensely is when you see the place that looks pretty perfect online, ask landlord to mail you application before going to showing. Arrive with it right at the beginning of the showing. I guarantee if there are other people there desperately wanting the place they haven‚Äôt thought of this and will ask for the application AT the showing. Even if they start frantically filling it out there, yours is already completed and ready to go. 

Sometimes landlords want to collect all applications and choose best person but more often than not the first one they get that they take the time to ‚Äúprocess‚Äù gets priority. This has snagged me sweet rentals past few years to the shegrin of other people who arrive and try to scramble to get it.

fsdy92,ga_southern,"LPT: Make time to show your older parents how to do a video call on their phone or device during this time of isolation, it makes them feel good to see your face","Let's face it, most of our parents are completely happy to have a 2 hour phone conversation about nothing, especially if you don't live close to your parent.  My mother lives 5 hours away from me, lives in a rural area of Georgia, is not married and works for a business where she is usually the only person in the office.  It's easy for her to feel isolated, but she's been doing this for years.  Now that everyone (including myself) are also self isolating, it brought added awareness to the isolation that I see my mother is used to (or has been dealing with).  She's ok with it most of the time, and just a weekly or every other week phone call is our routine.  She also talks with my siblings who live closer and visit more often than I do.  


Even though mom is technology challenged like people her age can be, I try to make sure she always has anything she needs, new cell phones when needed, new routers when needed, and help her with technology.  Instead of our weekly regular phone call, I did a Facebook video call with her yesterday.  I let her know in advance I would be doing a video call, and not to worry about how she looked (we all are house hermits).  It failed the first 5 times because she didn't know how to give video and microphone access to FB Messenger, but we chatted through that and before long, she was all set.  


At first, the conversation went a little wonkier than a normal audio phone call, but then she got more used to it.  Bonus: the rambling about repetitive topics was cut down with the video call.   Our call was about 45 minutes and at the end of the call, my mom thanked me for doing the video call with her and told me how much she enjoyed seeing me instead of just talking to me.  It will probably be our new normal.  If she's interested, I'll get her setup to have the option of using a webcam (like me) rather than her phone, which will make it hands free and give her the ability to use other programs like Zoom in case I need to help her with other computer issues, etc.

Nearly all snakes we come into contact with are non-venomous and most are actually great to have around the house (especially if you have a garden) as they keep pests and rodent populations under control.,"There are a few things to consider when you see a snake in your yard. 

1. If you are unsure of what type of snake it is, it is best to leave it alone and try to identify what kind it is later after you have moved away from it. 
2. Keep kids and pets away from the snake until it identified. If it is harmless, it is still a good idea to not let the kids or pets play around that area for a little while. 
3. In most areas, you can call your local humane society or make a non-emergency call to your local law officials. Some areas have an actual snake removal professional you could call. 
4. Attempt to identify the snake, this website is a great resource to use if you live in North America: [http://www.whatsnakeisthat.com/](http://www.whatsnakeisthat.com/) (this is not a solicitation nor do I have any affiliation with this site, I have used this site for years as I live near a river this has been the best, quick resource I have found). There are also great tips on here for snake bites, discouraging habitat for snakes, etc...
5. Never try to kill or move a venomous snake, this is dangerous. Let a professional handle it. Also, remember the snake means you no harm and is actually more scared of you, then you are of it (believe it or not).

frwt3y,ElkheartEndeavors,LPT- Use everything you have!,"All parts of every piece of food are useful, IMO. Now, with resources growing scare &amp; price gouging, many of have the opportunity to learn to be more resourceful. Here's a table of ideas we've been doing here in AZ--

Food scraps- make stock! Vegetable, beef, chicken, whatever you have will make excellent stock that can enhance your meals.

Food scraps- compost! Gardening season is upon us, get a good start by starting to compost now.

Food scraps- Seeds! Seeds! Seeds! Here's a short list of seeds that can be replanted in your garden:

(This also includes nubs and ends that can be replanted, similar to that beautiful post earlier today about the green onions)

\-Lettuce

\-Green onions

\-Lemongrass

\-Celery

\-Sweet potatoes

\-Bean sprouts

\-Avocados

\-Potatoes

\-Pineapple

\-Ginger

\-Garlic

\-Onions

\-Peppers

\-Tomatoes

\-Fennel

\-Most fresh herbs

\-Some nuts

(Back to the list of other uses)

\-Bone scraps from meats--Stock, then jewelry or art. (Who doesn't want a bone necklace?)

\-Coffee/tea waste-- grains can go into the compost, liquid can be used to paint with. Very fun to try to challenge yourself to only do painting with different shades of one color. The feeling is similar to watercolors.

\-Bread/pastries- I highly encourage everyone to get a dehydrator. In the world of meal prep and preservation it will rock your world. I promise. If you don't have a dehydrator you can easily dry bread by putting your oven on the lowest setting for a few hours. Dry loaves or slices whole, then grate with a cheese grater for bread crumbs. Alternatively, cut them into small, bite size pieces and season with salt and garlic powder, then dry for cheap, homemade croutons! 

\-Fruit peels-- make tinctures by soaking peels in water for a boost of vitamin C, or mix with your favorite salad dressing for a bit of a kick. You can also compost these, just make sure to remove the sticker first. 

\-Waste paper-- A lovely project to do with kids. Get paper (even if it has ink on it), then soak it in a bucket or pot overnight. The next day, stick your hands inside and rip up all the paper, you can also use an immersion blender to get it done quicker. I would NOT recommend putting this into your food processor or blender. Once the scraps are down to the sizes of nickels or pennies, use a sieve and assemble them on a baking tray into one giant sheet you can cut up later or into smaller sheets of paper. You can also blend up construction paper for a more colorful end product. Stick the baking tray into the oven on the lowest setting for a few hours, making sure to keep an eye on it every 5-10 minutes. Be very careful and read the line below. 

IMPORTANT- If using your oven, DO NOT open the door before turning off the oven and letting it cool for at least 2 hours. Doing so rapidly introduces oxygen to the heat and can cause your project to catch on fire. Been there, not fun. 

Another method for this is to prop up a window screen horizontally with room below for air, then put your drying paper on it and leave it outside for a few hours to dry.  Much safer than the oven method. 

\-Spare paper-- Learn origami and make dioramas or give out as gifts once this all blows over (make sure to disinfect)

\-Spare paper- A great time to improve your drawing skills! Even if you believe you can't there's about a million hours of art lessons on YouTube to help you. Take it as a challenge to practice for a set amount of time each day. I've been doing at least an hour, but not everyone has that amount of time every day. The lowest I would go is 5-10 minutes. Try drawing the same picture each day and see your improvement in a week.

\-Spare paper- Make a flipbook/comic

\-Spare paper- Take this time to use your new art skills to mass produce homemade cards, but don't write anything in them yet. Next birthday, funeral or holiday your family/friends will have a nice homemade card, and you won't be spending the money to buy any and you won't have to spend the time later to make them yourself. 

Thank you for reading! I hope that these help you use your spare resources and help you pass the time, especially with kids. I send out a salute to all parents during this time. If anyone has any questions feel free to write them in the comments below and I will try to get back to you. Additionally, share some more ideas down there!

frw4en,bert_cj,LPT: Why should people have strong work ethics?,"I spent the first 22 years of my life pursuing a high paying field. I enjoyed it very much and was very happy with the field I chose, I feel like no other field would bring me a better combination of happiness and pay as this one.

Don't get me wrong it's still work. Lately I've been struggling with working hard. I was always proud of my work ethic in college and high school. I've had a job since I was 16 and all throughout college I worked overnight on the weekends at a 24 hour fast food restaurant and last two years delivering pizza. Every single weekend I worked, M-F I studied all the time.

My initial motivator was being poor. Growing up poor I saw the struggles of what poverty does to families. Health and overall happiness. People say money doesn't buy happiness, but I personally believe not having money can make you absolutely miserable, I've seen it first hand. I have other beliefs about being poor but that's not important to this post. I just knew I didn't want to struggle the same way my family did, so I worked hard to break that cycle for myself.

I feel like I had such a strong work ethic because I was in pursuit of something. Now that I have the good job I'm not really in pursuit of anything. I'm just chillin now, much more relaxed, a lot more free time, and I'm starting to lose motivation at work.

I'm starting to wonder why should I even have a strong work ethic to begin with? Why should anybody? I'm no longer poor, I've accomplished my goal, I'm living very comfortably.

If you are the owner of any type of resistance band follow this easy tutorial:

1. Take your band, twist and fold it onto itself. I have attached a [Picture](http://imgur.com/gallery/gB1DEe8) of what it should look like.

2. Put it on one should and reach behind with your other arm and put it in like a backpack / school bag.

When people hear they  ""don't need"" something, that just tells them it's not a necessity, or it's not worth it to the advice giver. It doesn't tell them it won't make their job any faster/better/prettier.

A nice drill or impact driver will give a better experience driving screws than a shitty one, even in untrained hands. A titanium nitride coating will do literally nothing for a woodworker. It's there to reduce friction, which is a problem for hard metals. A cheap drill lasts for 100 hours. An expensive drill lasts 5x as long but only costs twice as much. But if you're only using it for 50% between now and the day you die, the cheap one is better value for money.

A nice PC will run Skyrim with more graphics mods than a lower end PC. You don't need one for vanilla, but it might still give you more consistent framerates, even if your monitor is only 60hz. A nice PC will not run Minesweeper any better at all.

No matter how bad a shot you are, a scope will make a rifle more accurate. Even if you can easily hit a target without the scope, having it would let you hit it better. But if  you're on a small boat that's bobbing up and down, and the enemy is bobbing up and down, and you're swaying left and right from sea sickness, your precision is going to be so low that accuracy might as well do nothing.

You don't need a single hair brush to paint a landscape. But it would let you add finer details than otherwise. You may be a hobbyist who won't be selling paintings, let alone demanding a higher price for those details, but it would allow you to do something you wouldn't otherwise be able to do, even if that extra thing is objectively worthless. But such a brush, despite the cost, wouldn't help at all in painting a wall one solid colour.

You don't need a HAZMAT suit to walk through a hospital (at any time other than this one), but it would reduce the chance of you catching something, even if that reduction is 0.1% to 0%.

It's easy to feel like our friends don't care as much as we do.

Well as times get scary, it is really important for those who don't normally reach out first to start doing so.

This doesn't mean that you all were jerks for not doing so already, but it can definitely appear like you're aloof and a tad bit uncaring.

Conditioning is a weird thing. If you're a natural introvert who may even be a bit shy, then maybe you are used to people reaching out first.

Now is the time to start flipping things on their head. 

It's time to be active with your friendships in terms of reaching out. You may believe you don't have to, but trust me...it is the nicest thing ever (hyperbolically speaking) to have someone reach out with the question: ""Hey dude (or girl), how have you been doing?""

These aren't ordinary times. Reach out first. 

Please. 

And honestly, this is a good habit to do even during normal times.

This post wasn't meant for people who always reach out first. Y'all are national treasures. This is purely for those who may rarely do so. Just reach out with a ""So I saw this YouTube clip the other day...""

During this quarantine, your car may be sitting in the drive way longer than usual and your battery is at risk! If your staying put, pick one morning to run the engine for a few minutes at least once every 10-14 days. This will save you from dealing with a dead battery.

Take extra measures like having at least half a tank of gas. Gas prices are lower in most areas, fill that tank up now before prices go back up! 

Don‚Äôt forget to check your tire pressure at the gas station if available. Unsure how? Most tire centers will provide courtesy tire checks for you, just call ahead to ask. 

While you‚Äôre at it, go through that trunk and take out all that crap you don‚Äôt need. 

But don‚Äôt wash your car at home, that‚Äôs typically a waste of water. 

Shelter-in-place/work from home can be a blessing in disguise for most of us who are workaholics.

frc6im,Hattix,LPTs for Cyclists,"Here's an unordered list of stuff a cyclist needs to know, from someone who's maintained a bike for years.

* Fit a master link to your chain to take it off easily. A chain tool (which you should have) can fit it. Your chain should be degreased every month in either engine degreaser, or a 5:1 solution of hot water to dish soap. The chain should not squeat, and black or rust coloured chain needs attention!
* Know what tyres to use. On road, you need slick tyres. Schwalbe's Marathon or, if you want to sometimes go off road, Landcruiser. Observe their tread pattern. The upright rolling section is slick, this reduces rolling resistance and maximises traction and grip on a hard surface. A tread pattern offers you nothing on a surface your tyres can't deform. Bikes cannot aquaplane, so don't worry about that.
* Quickly and easily index your gears: Your gear controls have a knob to tighten or loosen the cable. If your bike is in a higher (smaller gear) than intended, the cable is too loose. Likewise for the contrary case: If it's in a lower gear than intended, the cable is not tight enough. Turn in quarter-revolution increments.
* Your seat should be adjusted such that you can, at maximum leg extension, keep the ball of your foot on the lowest pedal, then dropped by 10 mm. You should be almost, but not quite, fully extending your legs. Most people have their seats WAY too low! You should not be able to plant both feet at the same time.
* Fixing a puncture is not about sealing the hole. It's about finding the thorn, glass or stone in the tyre. When removing the tube, make a note of  the orientation of it, so you know where the hole relates to the tyre. This way you know where to look on the inside of the tyre for the guilty item.
* Oiling the chain is oiling its internals. Oil it well, but sparingly, then leave it to sit. Wipe off any external oil with absorbent material. The excess makes dirt stick, which is abrasive and damages the chain.",7,1585512023,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/frc6im/lpts_for_cyclists/,LifeProTips,2

frbnlr,thenewfrontiersman88,LPTs: How to deal with isolation from a seasonal worker that lives alone on a farm in rural Canada.,"So first to give some credence to why I have knowledge in this area. I have been laid off work every year since I was 18, (except to years in college) come Christmas and don‚Äôt get to start work till April-May. I live in a community of 800 full time residence, that are generally twenty to thirty years my seniors. I have lived by myself and work by myself throughout the rest of the year. I also have no internet except data on my phone and no television.

1)First off have friends or family or at least people that you phone once a day. It will drive you crazy not hearing another‚Äôs voice or having a two way conversation. Call grandma/grandpa, mom, dad, sister/brother, best friend and so on alternately and have a real conversation for half an hour an hour each day with someone at the end. ( it helps family/friends and bonds and will grow your relationship) 
-do not rely solely on who you live with for social interaction you will learn to hate each other from too much
-for ways to have a conversations, talk about common interests, and then what they enjoy, find out why they enjoy these things. Learn to actually debate, if they have an opposing view hear them out, argue about key points and just don‚Äôt be blind saying one thing without reasons.(When my gran was alive we‚Äôd argue on the phone for an hour about politics, or death penalty neither of us would win but we‚Äôd not leave angry)

2) Learn yo meander on tasks, this will be hard for you industrious folks out there but every task can take hours if you go slow, always needing to get something else or get distracted. (Turn a half hour job into multiple hour job). Wash stuck on grime with dishes with only a cloth without a thick brush or steel wool. You have no we‚Äôre to be so keep busy. I cut firewood with a chainsaw and though I have an industrial splitter I use an axe.

3) Make tasks for yourself, have you ever pulled out the fridge and cleaned behind it? Have you ever sponge washed the ceiling. Well these task should be done anyway, how‚Äôs your time. 

4) Read a lot and things you enjoy, everyone has a book they always wanted to finish, lack of books in your house, try FanFiction.Net, Ao3. They‚Äôve got home done fan fictions of stories. Then there‚Äôs millions of news articles out there or read up and research skills of what you want to learn.(I‚Äôm currently researching building cordwood log homes)(also reading a fan fiction plus two printed books if one gets boring, try another)

5) teach yourself new skills, suck at art. Well here‚Äôs your shot at becoming an artist. Rules of thumb are do stuff you might actually enjoy. ( Don‚Äôt always go the boring route, if you have a guitar, you don‚Äôt need to know how to do everything except learn the AC/DC song. Figure out the one song, your not perfect and they get paid to do it). (I do art and I draw cars and pinup girls, one because if your gonna stare at something for three hours, at least enjoy it).

7) Start to plan your future, not just freaking out about being laid off all these things will end sooner or later and then you‚Äôll deal with it in the future. What‚Äôs your long term goal. 
-ex. You wanna own a restaurant?, a farm?, a log cabin?, or even say you wanna have kids. Become an expert in it. Read up on rules by-laws. Resource packs become so knowledgeable and have such a plan that you can have a countdown clock from when you start working that you can count down till you have enough money to start.

8) Reach out across the world, there‚Äôs people stuck inside all over the place right now, start a correspondence with someone you feel that‚Äôs interesting(I will recommend starting with 10) it will whittle down quickly) there‚Äôs good Reddit‚Äôs for that, like r/R4R, r/penpal, r/seekingfriends, plus a whole host of applications.
-true letter writing is a time consuming effort that will take a few hours to write, learn to actually format what you see in your life, make it interesting and be able to write to someone, Also finding there life interesting and asking questions. (Young guys, this will help you with dating when this is all over, since ladies hate a bore and someone who isn‚Äôt interested in there life)

9) have routines, don‚Äôt watch television all the time. As I said do tasks, but if you like ex. blue bloods on thursdays or you watch television at this time. Keep to that routine. Don‚Äôt make tv. Or your phone your only go to. 1) it causes restlessness. 2) it causes you to hate your relaxation time.

10) Shut off your damn devices and go to bed at a reasonable time. You‚Äôll start getting pulled into staying up later and later till you sleep the day away and then you will get mad at yourself and then you‚Äôll get depressed and start to spiral.

11) Remember, right now you have all the time in the world so accomplish something, it need not be big but always do something. The grocery stores are still supplying so eat like a king, cook like grandma or mom used to.
-don‚Äôt eat too much sugars though, being wound up will get you just pissed off if you got nowhere to be. 

12) Stay physical, stay active and just enjoy life. It‚Äôs the only one you got.

13)Have talk radio or podcasts on for a couple hours each day, the voices will soothe you, you might learn something and they break up the monotony. I listen to Joe Rogan/hardcore history and various other podcasts throughout the day, don‚Äôt be afraid to shout back at them your alone, they don‚Äôt judge.

P.s the longest I‚Äôve gone without significant human interaction is 14 weeks.

- Your child must hang out with the new friend one on one for a least an hour that month. 

- Your child must invite them to hang out with other friends

- Once your kid has 5 or so friends he must throw a party that month

So many parents don't know how to get their child to make friends, do it the old fashion way, bribe them. 

I realise a lot of you are going to point out the shallowness of this idea. You are exactly correct it is 100% shallow. However so is most of the world. Your child will be exposed to networking at an early age, be forced to adapt to and appeal to multiple personality types, learn what kinds of people they actually enjoy having around them, and be seen as someone who is invested in getting to know others. 

So what if it's not ""the bonds of friendship"" most childhood friendships go nowhere. This is a great tool for giving a child the confidence to step out and try to do something.

However, I buy pool chlorine using reusable jugs. 

A bottle of 6% sodium hypochlorite/94% water Clorox costs $3-$4 according to google (and gone from the shelves at the moment). 

The 2.5g of 10.5% sodium hypochlorite/89.5% water costs $4. 

I can (but never have before) cut it with 1.87 gal of water to make 4.37gal of Clorox equivalent or almost 4x the amount of the same chemical for the same cost. 

While Clorox isn‚Äôt all that expensive, if you can‚Äôt find it this solution will work. Also, if you want a quick and easy way to cut down on your plastic waste, this is also one way of doing it, at least if you live close by to a pool supply distributor. 

If there are no pool distributors near you, but you visit big box stores that sell 10% chlorine in literally the same jugs Clorox sells bleach in, you can do the same math and ratios, and get bleach for about half the cost of Clorox.

fr5fj6,NeptuneAgency,LPT: This is a statement from an epidemiologist at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center.,"My uncle who runs a trauma center in a small hospital in New Hampshire sent me this. 

Hey everybody, as an infectious disease epidemiologist, at this point feel morally obligated to provide some information on what we are seeing from a transmission dynamic perspective and how they apply to the social distancing measures. Like any good scientist I have noticed two things that are either not articulated or not present in the ""literature"" of social media.
Specifically, I want to make two aspects of these measures very clear and unambiguous.
First, we are in the very infancy of this epidemic's trajectory. That means even with these measures we will see cases and deaths continue to rise globally, nationally, and in our own communities in the coming weeks. Our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and people will die that didn't have to. This may lead some people to think that the social distancing measures are not working. They are. They may feel futile. They aren't. You will feel discouraged. You should. This is normal in chaos. But this is also normal epidemic trajectory. Stay calm. This enemy that we are facing is very good at what it does; we are not failing. We need everyone to hold the line as the epidemic inevitably gets worse. This is not my opinion; this is the unforgiving math of epidemics for which I and my colleagues have dedicated our lives to understanding with great nuance, and this disease is no exception. We know what will happen; I want to help the community brace for this impact. Stay strong and with solidarity knowing with absolute certainty that what you are doing is saving lives, even as people begin getting sick and dying. You may feel like giving in. Don't.
Second, although social distancing measures have been (at least temporarily) well-received, there is an obvious-but-overlooked phenomenon when considering groups (i.e. families) in transmission dynamics. While social distancing decreases contact with members of society, it of course increases your contacts with group (i.e. family) members. This small and obvious fact has surprisingly profound implications on disease transmission dynamics. Study after study demonstrates that even if there is only a little bit of connection between groups (i.e. social dinners, playdates/playgrounds, etc.), the epidemic trajectory isn't much different than if there was no measure in place. The same underlying fundamentals of disease transmission apply, and the result is that the community is left
with all of the social and economic disruption but very little public health benefit. You should perceive your entire family to function as a single individual unit; if one person puts themselves at risk, everyone in the unit is at risk. Seemingly small social chains get large and complex with alarming speed. If your son visits his girlfriend, and you later sneak over for coffee with a neighbor, your neighbor is now connected to the infected office worker that your son's girlfriend's mother shook hands with. This sounds silly, it's not. This is not a joke or a hypothetical. We as epidemiologists see it borne out in the data time and time again and no one listens. Conversely, any break in that chain breaks disease transmission along that chain.
In contrast to hand-washing and other personal measures, social distancing measures are not about individuals, they are about societies working in unison. These measures also take a long time to see the results. It is hard (even for me) to conceptualize how 'one quick little get together' can undermine the entire framework of a public health intervention, but it does. I promise you it does. I promise. I promise. I promise. You can't
cheat it. People are already itching to cheat on the social distancing precautions just a ""little""- a playdate, a haircut, or picking up a needless item at the store, etc. From a transmission dynamics standpoint, this very quickly recreates a highly connected social network that undermines all of the work the community has done so far.
Until we get a viable vaccine this unprecedented outbreak will not be overcome in grand, sweeping gesture, rather only by the collection of individual choices our community makes in the coming months. This virus is unforgiving to unwise choices.
My goal in writing this is to prevent communities from getting
'sucker-punched' by what the epidemiological community knows will happen in the coming weeks. It will be easy to be drawn to the idea that what we are doing isn't working and become paralyzed by fear, or to 'cheat' a little bit in the coming weeks. By knowing what to expect, and knowing the importance of maintaining these measures, my hope is to encourage continued community spirit, strategizing, and action to persevere in this time of uncertainty.",65,1585486276,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fr5fj6/lpt_this_is_a_statement_from_an_epidemiologist_at/,LifeProTips,1

Take a breath and relax your shoulders. Unclench your jaw. Re-align your neck. Drop your shoulder blades down your back. 

The stress of everything right now is making us physically recoil in order to make us as small as possible to protect ourselves. We store that stress and trauma in our muscles and carry it around with us, further adding to the anxious feelings we‚Äôre all experiencing. Yoga helps a lot with this - stretching your body, breathing into the spaces that are tight, opening up and releasing. 

Check in again. Are you shoulders back to being tense? Your jaw? Relax them once more. Breathe deeply and exhale slowly, softening the places that feel tense. Repeat. 

I do this a *lot* throughout the day. It‚Äôs a good way to stay present and acknowledge how your mental state is manifesting in your body.

fr4flm,Devlyn90,Health dilemma,"Many years ago I have moved in the capital of my country to make a carrer and earn more money. Everything was ok in the first years  though, in this time my personal life suffers and don't try to find a work/life balance as I invest all my energy into learning and working,

As time goes by I am still working hard and stressing myself and I'm starting to accumulate medical problems.  I was going to lots of doctors, spending all my money though they say I'm ok.

I barely can get out of the bed each day because of lack of energy and muscle pain in my legs and hands.

Thinking more I discover I may have burnout though there is no official diagnostic because in my country this is more a taboo thing. So now I am tired of everyting, my bottle of energy is almost empty.

This year I decide that my first priority is health and I want to concentrate on it so I take medical leave. and all I do is to stay in bed, sleep a lot, reading, play games, going out or talk on the phone.

It's been 3 months since then and now I'm feeling better, but I'm not fully recovered. Soon I would have to go to work. Management called me and asked if I am going back to work or not, so they know to hire somebody else. I said yes..though I'm not sure.

Thinking to extend the medical leave or quit the job though I'm thinking that a new crisis /recession is near and it would be hard to get a good job. Also the option to discuss with management to see if they are willing to understand and manage me a little bit.

What is a wise decision in this situation?

so i figured, why not fuck with him a bit. i bought a mini bluetooth speaker and connected it my phone to it. i notice that at night the guy likes to sit in his bathtub and talk a lot on the phone. he loves going to the bathroom, he takes like 3 showers/baths per day. my bathroom is directly below his. so i go in, remove a piece of board from the ceiling, and put the bluetooth speaker right on there. i then play this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw1XbhYrnxQ

and i close my bathroom door so he can hear it but i can't lol. so i put it up and just annoy the shit out of him with it. if i go right under my bath tub i can hear his reactions. i've tested it a bit and can't tell if he hears it too loudly? that's the hardest part about this. i can't tell how much is too loud. i don't want to overly blast it and make it obvious it's coming from me. although it probably wouldn't be obvious since this kind of sound like radiates everywhere essentially

so yeah, it's hard to tell how much he's actually hearing it. i could blast it way up but that would overdo it lol i wanna have it just high enough so it drives him crazy lol

that's my tactic for dealing with this fat guy above me. he stays in all day cause of covid19. i have work still, but on my days off and when i'm not there i see no harm in fucking with him using this tone lol. finally time to fight back against this fuckhead haha. had to deal with his footsteps and loud voice for months. now i can attack him back with this tone woot",1,1585456693,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fqzync/lpt_noisy_neighbor_above_you_in_your_apartment/,LifeProTips,1

fqzpp4,neotedjohn,I‚Äôm thinking about changing my life drastically once COVID-19 is behind us. My decision will affect a lot of lives.,"So, I ended up with a pretty extreme illness and an injury right as the COVID madness was starting. This is now day 24 of my self-isolation and in that time I‚Äôve had some revelations. 

The most important one is that I am not happy. 

At 39, I have a company that is doing well (not amazing). We have about $35k in payroll a week and another $20k in Moscow expenses. All in all, the bills are paid and I don‚Äôt really want for much. 

I‚Äôm very well known where I live and I‚Äôve led a bit of a crazy life. This has made dating nearly impossible. I‚Äôm very, very single and I don‚Äôt like it much. It‚Äôs not that I need to be in a relationship but companionship is more fun. When I travel, I tinder. I‚Äôve met some amazing women that way and I enjoy never leaving the honeymoon phase (for now).

The problem I face is I hate what my company does. It drains my soul. In the midst of COVID I realize I don‚Äôt contribute a lot to this world and that‚Äôs really starting to bother me. 

If I‚Äôm honest, my perfect life is writing and travelling. 

As COVID eats through my savings and I keep paying my staff I realize that in 13 weeks I‚Äôll be in trouble. Most of my clients won‚Äôt survive this as my main client base is the restaurant industry. In short, there is a reset button coming and this might be the last chance to make a course correction that actually makes me happy. 

But, if I do what I‚Äôm thinking of doing a lot of people will be displaced and I‚Äôm essentially resetting my entire existence, which is pretty terrifying. 

My thought is I work with 3 or 4 high paying clients. That will give me enough to live out of hotels on a travel blogger rate. I can manage 3 or 4 clients easily so I‚Äôd work part time and then write and do my travel blog. During that time I want to find how I can help others in a meaningful way like those front line staff busting their asses right now. 

I won‚Äôt get rich off of this plan but I would be much happier. 

I wonder though, is 39 too late to be doing shit like this? I hate my place in the world and I don‚Äôt much like who I am as a man. This would help that. But, I‚Äôm 39, which means in 11 years I‚Äôm going to be in trouble if I don‚Äôt have considerable savings and investments as well as a retirement plan.

fqteql,9-BBN,LPT: Make sure to wear your face masks consistently and correctly!,"On my daily commute to work (in a hospital) using public transportation, i wear an advanced respiratory protection (half mask) simply because i don't trust anyone out there to follow the official recommendations. You won't believe the number of ignorant morons i encounter, sitting down right next to me when there would be plenty of space elsewhere, coughing out in the open, blowing their nose audibly and then proceed to touch buttons and grabpoles. But then i also see people wearing some kind of surgical mask with an erroneously heightened sense of security because they're doing it wrong. They will either have their mask pulled down below their chin to chatter, only cover the mouth while exposing the nose, and/or blatantly cough in the open because they think the mask retains everything - they don't - and frequently fondle them with bare hands. Also, if you're going to spend a lot of time with a lot of people in closed spaces, that kind of protection is just not good enough, because lots of aerosole particles are so small, they pass straight through that fabric. In addition, those masks don't form a tight seal around your face, so most of the air that you're breathing is drawn in from the sides. In case you still feel the need to protect yourself when leaving the house, follow these simple rules: 1) Only touch the mask at its edges once when you put it on and then when you take it off again - no readjusting or fondling in between. 2) Strap it tight and cover both mouth AND nose; they usually have a wire sewn-in that can be bent into shape across the nose bone. 3) Keep the mask up all the time, until you're again in a safe space like your own home. 4) Sneeze/Cough into your elbow regardless. 5) Wash your fucking hands!",28,1585432256,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fqteql/lpt_make_sure_to_wear_your_face_masks/,LifeProTips,1

fqorqy,effygrant,"LPT: make sure you define the problem, that's the first step to solving it","LPT- defining the actual problem, rather than just describing the reality, is the first step to solving it. I learned this from watching Barbara Coloraso give a talk (I saw the video) about helping people manage problems in their lives. It was the biggest ""Aha"" moment I've ever had. 

In the video, she describes a young pregnant girl coming to her for advice. Barbara says ""what is the problem you are facing?"" The girl says ""Isn't it obvious? I'm 17 and pregnant""

Then Barbara blows my mind with ""That's not the problem, that's the reality. The problem might be that you don't know whether to keep it or not, that you want something other than what the father wants, that you don't know where you are going to live with the baby, etc. Problems have solutions.""

This was huge for me, sometimes you have a reality that is so hard you don't break it down into the problems that you need to solve. You get overwhelmed because the whole of the situation is too much. 

So if you hate your job, break it down to the problem. Hating your job is a reality (for many people) so is the problem that you have unpleasant co-workers? Boring tasks? Mean boss? Those are problems you can tackle. Maybe try to find common ground with coworkers or see if you can change your work set up to see them less. Can you ask for more challenging tasks? Find a way to communicate with your boss better? Is the problem that you want a different job but don't know where to start? Talk to peoplel in your industry to see if there are openings, go to your local job centre, search online. Any of those is a better mindset than simply ""I hate my job."" 

Learning this helped me worry less and plan more efficiently. I don't get overwhelmed as much and when I do it's short lived as I know I have to sit down and clearly define the problem and the brainstorm solutions.",6,1585417541,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fqorqy/lpt_make_sure_you_define_the_problem_thats_the/,LifeProTips,12

fqomzc,Jankypox,LPT: Be wary of any and all charitable organizations asking for donations during this crisis. During ANY crisis or time for that matter!,"Especially in the US!

Charities and other 501(c) tax exempt non-profit organizations (like churches) and even the philanthropic arms of for-profit organizations (like those collections on the card machine at your grocery store), are woefully under-regulated, especially in the US.

Their main function and goal is to bring in money. Lots of it. As much as possible. And they are very, VERY good at it! How they sped that money is, quite literally, at their own discretion as long as they don‚Äôt show a ridiculous profit for that financial year.

That means whether they bring in $100 or $100 million, they can spend that money on salaries, property, rent, equipment, chief executive bonuses, advertising, operating expenses, accountants, consultants, legal fees, processing, billing, marketing, vehicles, certain investments, and maybe, just maybe, if there is anything left after all of that, on the actual cause they claim to represent. Unless there are claims of gross financial mismanagement or outright criminality, they are rarely regulated or closely monitored.

If you are familiar with a specific charity, relief organization, or religious organization by name, it‚Äôs because they have spent millions and millions over the years on advertising, marketing, property, staff, and senior executive salaries, and growing their organization. Period. That means the vast majority of the money they‚Äôve collected hasn‚Äôt reached the intended recipient/s. Be that hurricane relief, wildfire relief, cancer research, the hungry, the homeless, the war ravaged, refugees, or even Covid-19 relief.

Even the really good organizations with exceptional reputations and transparency get crushed under their own weight in terms of their operating costs. Dollar for dollar, cent for cent, most of the donation you make ends up going into the pocket of the organization itself and not to the intended recipient.

If you want to really help in times like this or at any other time, make your contribution go infinitely further, and make a real difference, rather directly support local businesses and services that are feeling the strain caused by the upheaval. Or reach out to people in your local Facebook group offering food, clothes, toys, baby stuff, etc. Or find smaller hands-on community or city driven programs in the area directly affected that you wish to help. Their overheads are usually very low and are made up of volunteers and/or employees who already get paid by the local government or through various state and federal grants.

Teachers especially are feeling the pinch right now, so consider reaching out to schools and donate equipment, books, stationary, and other resources, directly to their teachers, so that when they do come back to work, they don‚Äôt have to dig further into their already empty pockets this year or the next school year.",22,1585417117,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fqomzc/lpt_be_wary_of_any_and_all_charitable/,LifeProTips,8

Last 3 mos my friend ‚Äì a react js dev ‚Äì and I were working on an app for tracking relationships with friends and family.¬†

Finally, it‚Äôs ready. However, only an iOS version today. But the Android one is on its way since we use react native.¬†

Unfortunately, due to the app mechanic, we almost skipped the real beta-testing stage (yes, we know). For this, we need genuine interaction with friends and family here.

That said, I wonder if you could just spare a moment and kindly share your feedback on it now? And help us share the app :-)

fqjplb,szulu2222,LPT : The brutal truth about relationships," 

You like somebody, you get to know them, you decide you‚Äôre compatible. This takes a different amount of time for everyone, but it‚Äôs usually not years. Then come the good days. You finish each other‚Äôs sentences. You judge your friends‚Äô relationships for not being as healthy as yours. You promise to love each other forever.

Then one day you wake up and the infatuation is gone. You look at the person lying next to you and you don‚Äôt feel butterflies. You don‚Äôt want to jump their bones. You‚Äôd kind of like a day or two to yourself. And you pull away. You wonder if maybe you‚Äôre not compatible after all. You notice the way he always leaves his shoes right in the doorway and you‚Äôve tripped over them eighty-five times. Or how she sometimes puts garbage on the counter above the garbage can. Just throw it in the can, damn it! It‚Äôs eight inches away!

You think, ‚ÄúDuty is an awful reason to stay with somebody. Just because I made a promise in the midst of infatuation doesn‚Äôt mean I need to keep it. She‚Äôs changed, and I‚Äôve changed, and we don‚Äôt work together anymore.‚Äù And you break up. It‚Äôs the natural life cycle of a relationship. After going through it a few times, you come to a conclusion: humans, or at least you, aren‚Äôt meant to be eternally monogamous. Attraction dies after a while and relationships have this natural life cycle for a reason. Don‚Äôt stick with a relationship after the ‚Äúlove‚Äù is gone. It‚Äôs not right.

But another couple doesn‚Äôt break up. Another man says to his partner, ‚Äúthings aren‚Äôt working right now. Do you feel like we‚Äôre in a rut?‚Äù And she says ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù And they say, ‚Äúwell, we promised to stick it out. Let‚Äôs try to do it.‚Äù And they go through the motions, even though the ‚Äúlove‚Äù is gone. He‚Äôs not feeling planning a romantic date tonight. He‚Äôs tired and he wants to go to bed. But he cooks her favorite meal and goes on a walk in the local park. As they sit on a bench in the cool evening, she lies her head on his shoulder. He feels a single butterfly.

She‚Äôs thinking, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sweet he made my favorite meal, I can try to be an attentive and affectionate date.‚Äù She puts away her smartphone. She knows he likes to watch the birds, and so even though she thinks it‚Äôs kind of dumb, she points out a hawk while she lies up against him. He smiles. She feels a single butterfly.

The idea of having sex, at least with each other, has been out of both of their minds for weeks, maybe months. After all, they fell out of ‚Äúlove.‚Äù But she figures, what the hell, it‚Äôs been a nice evening. We‚Äôll see where things go. And he does too. And they have an even nicer evening.

He forces himself to listen to her work stories. She listens patiently while he tries to explain the problem he‚Äôs having with his program. They watch reality TV together even though she doesn‚Äôt like it, and then they decide to read a book at the same time and talk about it. He reads the damn thing, even though it‚Äôs one of those infuriating books with no plot. He admits he‚Äôs not into it, but he finds a couple nice things to say. She leaves a gift on his bedside when she gets up in the morning. They‚Äôre just going through the motions, even though they fell out of ‚Äúlove.‚Äù

And after a few months of this, they‚Äôre both happy. The butterflies, the infatuation, it comes and goes. Sometimes they‚Äôre just two people who live with each other and depend on each other. They do things they enjoy together, and things they don‚Äôt love together. They do things apart too, but always with the knowledge that somebody they care about is waiting when they get home. And one day, he realizes the secret. They never ‚Äúfell out of love.‚Äù ‚ÄúFalling out of love‚Äù is a dumb story people tell themselves to feel better about themselves. Sure, sometimes people reveal an entire personality they kept hidden during the opening stages of a relationship. Sure, some relationships turn abusive, or cold, or unendurable. But he was going to throw all of this away for a candy bar wrapper in the wrong place. She was going to throw all of this away for a second‚Äôs pause before entering her bedroom.

They were never out of ***love***, because love isn‚Äôt something you fall into. It‚Äôs something you *do.*",150,1585400251,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fqjplb/lpt_the_brutal_truth_about_relationships/,LifeProTips,1

fqc1k9,wishiwasonmaui,"LPT: For everyone stuck at home trying your hand at DIY projects, remember the Golden Rule of handiwork... Let the tool do the work!","Every tool was designed to make your job easier. Let it do the work. Your job is to guide the tool. Here are some examples:  
  
1. Sledgehammer. It's the weight and inertia of the hammer that does the work. Muscling the hammer down onto what you're hitting will only fatigue you faster and doesn't really help much. Use your energy to lift the hammer and then guide its fall onto the target.  Similar rules apply to other impact tools like regular hammers, picks, fence post drivers, ect.  
  
2. Skillsaw. Never force a saw. You should only need to gently push, guiding the saw carefully. If the saw isn't cutting, it might be a dull blade. Same applies for hand saws. If you are pushing hard, somethings wrong(blade pinch or dull blade usually). Similarly, for other power tools like reciprocating saws, jig saws, chain saws or even drills and grinders, you're only job is to guide the tool and keep yourself safe. Don't force it! One further example is a rotary hammer which is a drill(or chipper) for concrete. If you push hard, trying to make it drill faster, you'll just wear yourself out. It actually works much better to use light pressure and just guide the tool.  

3. Chisels. Dull chisels are very dangerous. If you find yourself forcing the tool, you need to sharpen it now or risk injury, not to mention fatigue.

fqa3fe,wander-and-wonder,"LPT from someone who caught it, for those who are feeling anxious","LPT **FROM SOMEONE WHO IS ON DAY 12 OF THE VIRUS - TO THOSE WHO FEEL ANXIOUS**

First of all: I have not been tested. I was placed on a waiting list when my symptoms started, but due to not being in a critical condition, health services phoned me to say that while they are certain I do have Covid-19, they have a very significant backlog and so I should follow all procedures to isolate and to call in if symptoms got worse. I have not needed to phone in. 

So *how do I know for sure that I have it?* 

I travelled home from what is now a high risk zone. I do not know anyone who has not developed symptoms in that zone, and all who have been tested are positive. I was in contact with people confirmed with the virus on multiple separate occasions the week before I got home. I developed the same symptoms as those who have been confirmed positive.

**Now to get to the life tip!**

I spent a month and a half reading the coronavirus sub, I was becoming increasingly anxious to a point of feeling unwell just reading that sub. I knew it was headed to Europe and I was not dealing with the anxiety of it. 
Soon, cases started growing exponentially in italy, a close neighbour to the country I was working in. Eventually a lockdown was put in place. Soon the cases started creeping up in the canton that I was in. And eventually there was a case in my local hospital. I did not know I had caught the virus when I travelled back to my home country, but I had to return home as I lost my job due to the seasonal resort closing where I worked. but within days of returning, my close friends, colleagues and flatmates started confirming that they had it and then my symptoms started.

**This is where I am going to tell you not to let your anxiety get the better of you, but this is also where you should realise that you need to continue to do everything possible to stop the spread for the people who are at risk. So do try to relax, but do not stop taking all preventative measures seriously.**

I suspect I am on day 12 now as I had a fever 12 days ago. Then I had a mildly tight chest. The most common symptom in my community was loss of taste and smell. Sometimes that was the only symptom with the odd mild fever and general tiredness. So people started filming themselves blindfolded with their partners at home or family and they would do video chat games to see who could guess different sauces correctly. That is how much we could not taste or smell. But the bottom line is, we were all still in good spirits. My community that I am no longer in but live for 8 months per year (seasonal resort) is a small town of 12 000 people during the off season - and every person I know personally HAS caught the virus (some confirmed, some showing symptoms) - but they are ALL DOING FINE. The confirmed cases are ALL DOING FINE. Some are already better. And those who aren't a negative test result yet, feel like themselves again. Everyone has continued to work from home if they have jobs that allow for that. The demographics for the area are predominantly younger people between 19-50 years old, but there are older people too. Some people were hit quite hard with it, but when I say they were hit hard, I mean symptoms that are not as severe as bronchitis but cause discomfort. I.e. feeling tired and run down, general flu symptoms. Some just lost their taste and smell. Some had mild fevers. But everyone is doing okay. I know of ONE person who went to hospital for low oxygen saturation due to the virus (healthy, aged 37). But SHE IS FINE and she posted a status to let everyone know that she would be returning home soon and she was stable and on the mend. I know one 70 year old who was hit quite hard with it, but he is stable too and apparently starting to get his appetite back. I was in the midst of a town which was hit HARD by the virus. And everyone is on the mend now. Most are returning to their normal daytime routines at home. Most are desperate to go outside for hikes and rock climbing. 

So the point here is:

1. DO NOT let your anxiety get the better of you. When you are in the midst of the crisis, you realize that the media really zones in on the worst of the worst and for the majority of healthy humans, this virus will come and go without making a significant mark on you. I am yet to know of anyone who has gone into critical care for this virus. There are many people on the news, yes. But in real life, you may not know anyone who gets to critical care.


2. Limit your time watching the news. What I saw before I was in the midst of the virus was people collapsing in the streets, death, people in critical states and enough to still make my stomach turn with fear and sadness. But once the virus hit my town, I had a big wake up call to the fact that what we see on the media is not necessarily OUR reality when the crisis reaches us. But we *do need to realize that that is the reality for people who are at risk and so we should protect those people by preventing the spread* 


3. I learnt that the virus spreads at an EXPONENTIAL rate. I had sore hands from sanitizing, I was covering my face, I minimized contact with people, and I did not touch my face. I washed my hands in my own home. But I still somehow caught the virus. It took about ten days for most of the community to show symptoms. It spread like wildfire and it is unbelievable how efficient this virus is at spreading. *so* instead of being scared of that, just follow preventative measures for people who are at risk. Stay home if you can, catch up on reading or indoor hobbies, tend to your garden if you have one, do all those video calls with distant family, write a book, start a journal, spring clean your home, practice your cooking. And  only go out for essentials. By doing that you are helping stop the spread. Don't dwell too much on being stuck at home, *try to enjoy the slow life for a while* and if you are working from home, make your spot a comfortable spot to work from. Find a window and move some things around so your desk can be there. Put some music on in your home and open windows. Try to make home a happy atmosphere. 


4. My symptom timeline:

DAY 1-2: Fever of 37.5 then 37.7. Felt like I was had a cold coming on.

DAY 3-5: Pressure on my chest. So a tight chest but not severe or causing me to feel breathless. I felt quite weak and very tired, like you feel after you have done strenuous exercise muscle wise. Then tiredness felt like being lethargic and wanting to lie down often.

DAY 5-7: Zero sense of taste or smell. Mild shortness of breath after throwing the ball for my dog and lapping my small townhouse garden a few times. Blocked ears.

DAY 8-12: Started to get my taste and smell back. Started to feel better.

DAY 12: Today I had a pretty bad sinus headache all day, but I think that is seasonal pollen allergies. I am fine now and took some paracetomal and an allergy tablet. I do not in any way think this is related to the virus.


Throughout the whole experience: I continued to play out in my garden with my dog. Continued to work from home. Continued to wish I could go beyond my garden for a long walk or trip to the beach!! I will be isolating for a long while still especially with the restrictions. So I'm keeping myself busy at home.


5. Now to repeat my first point. DO NOT let your anxiety get the better of you. Take this as an opportunity to do all those things you haven't been able to in the rush of everyday life. Take some time to live a slow and calm life. Limit the news - it is toxic to overwatch the news. Watch what is necessary each day, then put your tv shows back on.",89,1585357181,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fqa3fe/lpt_from_someone_who_caught_it_for_those_who_are/,LifeProTips,1

I want to warn renters not to wait until their rent is due to ask for a deferment if you are out of work because of coronavirus. If your land-lord or leasing office is like mine, you will be stuck with late fees or worse. Call them now.

I moved to a new city just 2 months ago to start a new job with a hotel. I was looking forward to a new career and a bright future when the news came down; the hotel was shutting down. Everyone was laid off. Stuck in a city by myself with a year-long lease and no family here to help, I started looking for ways to make my situation better.

After filing for unemployment, the first place I called was the leasing office at the apartments where I live. I explained to them my situation, that the layoff is only temporary, I will be back to work in a few months, and that I will have money coming in from unemployment soon. I just need to defer rent for a few weeks to get my finances in order and I can pay rent like normal. I fully expected they would cooperate.

No. Residents are expected to pay rent on time on the first of the month. There will be no extensions, no flexibility, no exceptions. If you can‚Äôt pay rent then a late payment fee will be added to your bill. I have never missed a payment with anyone. Now, because of a national emergency outside of my control, my credit score will be blemished.

I want the community to know that apartment complexes are refusing to cooperate with the community in this time of dire need.

Hotkeys:

J - takes you to the post below the one you currently have selected

K - takes you to the post above

A - upvote

Z - downvote

X - opens or closes the image/gif embedded in the post

C - opens the post in a new tab, so you can read/post comments

L - does the same as C, but also opens a tab with the link/image embedded in the post

S - saves the post

H - hides the post

Is anyone familiar with the best way or source to compile this? I don‚Äôt know where to start, but it becomes so much that it is hard to keep order of it. 
Table, graph, is there a website or any way to track or show the behaviour and time line of this, easy so someone objective can see?

I wrote it out today and I have it on paper but. I just need to show what everyone is missing in the easiest most objective way.. some chart.. idk. Any advice is really appreciated. I have years worth but want to start with the last week of recent attacks to show what I found.

Hope everyone is safe and well, and thank you in advance. Will be happy to answer questions to find a solution",12,1585329294,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fq108g/lpt_request_is_anyone_familiar_with_how_to/,LifeProTips,2

( I posted this to  [r/unpopularopinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/) and decided to share it here as well)

I  have 2 dobermans that I walk usually twice a day and many times have  had off leash dogs and children run up to them, The thing is while they  are sweet and not aggressive they could probably kill or seriously  injure if they felt threatened. They are around 80 - 90 pounds of Muscle  and fierce love.

To protect  myself from liability I keep an old cell phone on a belt clip that runs a  Dash Cam program while I have my dogs out. It isn't perfect but it  shows my dogs are on leash and records audio as well.

This is the one I am running but there are many out there that are free to use:

fpony2,trinityorion84,LPT: Tip for those stuck at home. Job shadow a cat if you can. You're welcome.,"I've been working on my own hours from home for several years. I went through an experiment of living in a ""land of no time"". I tried not to look at the time for longer periods in hopes to find my ideal natural clock. 

It was a bit of an anxious start but eventually I spent a very rainy day roughly mirroring the cat's schedule.

When she ate, I'd have a snack, when she slept I'd find something physically still to do (read, watch something, or in my case work). When she started running around I'd do something more physical. When she had a kitty bath I'd shower or work on a house cleaning task etc.

Using observation from this, eventually I actually became more efficient, felt anxiety subside and enjoyed simple things more. Like laying on a sunny carpet, playing with said cat apparently..or getting up earlier. I realized those tasks that build up were naturally just getting done in a strange flow. 

This helped me find an at home work life balance.  It is possible and it can be partially glorious.",66,1585274894,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fpony2/lpt_tip_for_those_stuck_at_home_job_shadow_a_cat/,LifeProTips,1

It is a thoughtful act of love, and the amount of time and stress it can save loved ones in times of hospitalization or loss of life is enormous!","A Legacy Drawer is a record of all essential data a person might have that a loved one would need access to in the case of that person's untimely death. Essential data would be things like bank records, passwords, tax information, safety deposit box information, etc. I'm not sure if he came up with the idea, but Dave Ramsey often talks about and recommends establishing a legacy drawer. 

It might not be fun to think about, but make no mistake; **Making a legacy drawer for those you leave behind is an immensely useful act of thoughtfulness and LOVE.**  


With COVID-19 affecting the  whole world and people being holed up, there's never been a better time to set aside an hour and get all essential information together that your loved ones might need if you were to be incapacitated or pass away. No one lives forever, and having your legacy drawer ready to go is a guaranteed investment into the future mental health and wellbeing of the people you love. It doesn't matter if you're young with nothing but social media accounts that will need closing, or older with invested assets and lockboxes, there is almost certainly information you could leave to ease the suffering of your loved ones in the event of your passing.

Dave Ramsey's site has a great breakdown of things to be prepared for:  
[https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/legacy-drawer-keep-your-family-prepared](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/legacy-drawer-keep-your-family-prepared)   


Additionally, password vaults like [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) and cloud storage services like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) have free versions and can be extremely useful in these situations. This is the bare minimum I would recommend doing for the people you care about from an electronic standpoint. 

Set up a LastPass account with an extremely complicated [passphrase](https://xkcd.com/936/). Many people I know prefer song lyrics. Print and store that passphrase in a place to be retrieved in the event of your untimely passing. Then:

1. Use LastPass or another password manager for all your essential passwords.
2. Make a bookmark folder in your web browser and make bookmarks to the websites of all essential banking, mortgage, health insurance, 401k, utility billing, and any other organizations you have recurring business with. Log into each website, and save the login information for each website into LastPass for later.
3. Make the bookmark folder that you just created accessible via cloud storage or through a private URL using a service like Dropbox.
4. Leave electronic copies of any essential legal or financial documents that your family would need access to in the event of your passing in a Dropbox or secure cloud storage account .
5. Leave printed or secure electronic instructions with your loved ones that tells them about the location of the written password and bookmark folder that they will need if you pass away.

She would just talk to me when we went on walks. She'd ask me ""What is that?"" and ""Why do you think it's like that?"", which helped me develop a larger vocabulary because I'd ask her what certain words meant and what things were as well. This led to when we went to apply for kindergarten, where I was technically a year too young to apply.

fpm7qh,MGTOW-guy,LPT: do not work hard on fixing your relationship when your partner claims you are not good enough. This unintentionally provokes your partner to be upset on you more often and get more benefits.,"You all know that some partners tend to tell things like ""I'm bored"", ""You don't dedicate enough of time to me"", ""we have not visited a party or have not moved anywhere for last 3 years"", or ""I've spent best years of my life on you and what do I get instead"".  

The most popular response is to fulfil your partners' desires and wishes and prove that you worth them. 

But there is another approach. Do not invest in these particular relations, because your partner is already upset. Instead, invest in yourself. Get more muscles,  less fat, get a better job, a better dress, find a hobby. Fix your bad habits, make new good habits. Be a more attractive and more interesting person. And instead response to your partner how great you are and how awesome you are and how other people are happy about you.

Either your partner will notice positive changes and start to like you more or your partner completely breaks relations and you can find a new one and enjoy a novelty of a new love. Win-Win in both cases!

Value yourself and your partner will like you even more. Yeah, may be a different partner, but you are guaranteed to live with a happy partner that way all the time.",3,1585265611,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fpm7qh/lpt_do_not_work_hard_on_fixing_your_relationship/,LifeProTips,1

If you had that philosophy, you could have become the richest journalist in the world today."" 

Always put this in mind whenever you've been given a chance to do something or to join something. Win or lose, chosen or rejected, pass or fail, just do it. Every opportunity is another chance to become something. If you didn't get what you've worked for, take it as experience gained. You'll never know when your will time be. So just grab every opportunity you will encounter!  


 

During this famous interview, a journalist asked Bill Gates:

&gt;*‚ÄúMr. Gates, what is the secret of your success?‚Äù*

Bill Gates did not answer this question directly and handed him a cheque telling her to write on it the amount of her choice.

The journalist was offended by this answer and replied to Bill Gates:

&gt;*‚ÄúMr. Gates, I‚Äôm not talking about that.‚Äù*

Then she repeated her question again:

&gt;*‚ÄúI ask you what is the secret of your success?‚Äù*

Bill Gates did exactly the same thing and handed her that cheque again and told her to write the amount of her choice on it.

The journalist took the check and tore it up!

Bill Gates then told the journalist who was quite upset:

&gt;‚ÄúThe secret of my success is that I do not miss any opportunities like you just did. If you had that philosophy, you could have become the richest journalist in the world today.‚Äù

fpbcjl,VeganLifestyles,"LPT: Practical TP Alternatives: SOAK &amp; SQUEEZE newspaper or any paper product, then wipe!","This a very practical solution in any emergency or frugal situation when absorbent paper is required‚Ä¶


1.You can use newspaper, grocery circulars, paper towel (or most other paper products) to wipe if TP is scarce but you should ""wet/soak"" the paper first &amp; squeeze the excess and wipe (running the paper under a faucet for few seconds or soak in a small container with diluted bleach if necessary)‚Ä¶ 

2. By soaking paper, it becomes way less abrasive (sometimes very soft) and cleans better **but you shouldn't flush the paper after (might gummy up/clog the drainage over time) , instead you should put waste into a doubled bag or garbage bag or dump bucket (see below) ‚Ä¶ 

3. The newspaper should be safe as I'm sure they only use vegetable oil based/soy inks in the modern world... (see below)‚Ä¶

4. Even old mail, printer papers, slick catalogs and phone book pages will usually work well after they are soaked for a couple seconds or longer, you can even squeeze it /ring out the water and it makes it very soft and keeps its shape and doesn‚Äôt disintegrate like TP... 

You can even add peels or rinds of lemon, lime or orange to the doubled bag to mask any smell... or if you get a bucket you can fill it with parts vinegar or bleach and water and submerge the waste paper in there and cover it, the vinegar or bleach will over power any smells and further condense the paper, **when buckets 3/4's full, empty only the water into the toilet and put the waste paper into a double bag to prevent leaks and take outside daily, weekly etc. to your trash/waste bin, soiled paper is not recyclable‚Ä¶ 


‚ÄúThe consensus is that modern newspaper ink ‚Äì mineral oil- or vegetable oil-based ‚Äì poses minimal risk to gardeners and gardens. Newsprint itself contains no significant residues or toxins, and even slick advertising sections are safe to use, according to Botts‚Äù

https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/community/university-city/article9097874.html


‚ÄúNewspaper inks and papers are pretty safe, especially compared to the old days when lead type was used for printing. It's no longer used. In fact the EPA has guidelines for U.S. newspapers that prevents the use of, for instance, heavy metals. Most pigments - for black and white or color - are organic materials.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore than 90% of the nation's daily newspapers are printed with color soy ink. Rice ink, that uses rice bran oil as a solvent, can be used as an alternative to Soy Ink.‚Äù

fow9gb,Cmen6636,[LPT] How to work from home without going crazy,"How to work from home without going crazy

I‚Äôve seen lots of people struggling with a transition from working in office to at home.

For 5 years my work schedule has been 2-3 days working out of state, and the rest of the week working from home. Sometimes I go weeks at a time only working from home with little to no traveling. I wanted to share tips that have helped improve my personal and professional life while working at home.

1. Designate an uncommon space as your office, a room you don‚Äôt typically go into while you‚Äôre at home, like an extra bedroom or a garage. If you don‚Äôt have that available, curtain off a corner of your bedroom or living room. Point is: make a very clear divide. This space is now the office. You enter it while you‚Äôre at work, and you don‚Äôt enter it while you‚Äôre ‚Äúat home‚Äù. 

2. Treat this space like you would your regular office. Now that most of y‚Äôall are probably over the honeymoon phase of working at home, it‚Äôs time to take the dog/cat out of the room, and put on pants. I know, this is the least fun part. But trust me, it‚Äôs for your own good.
Though you don‚Äôt need to be SUPER strict with this, try to act exactly as you would in the office. If you decide to  take advantage of PH‚Äôs free vids, go to the bathroom, don‚Äôt sit in your office for this. Unless you do this regularly in your actual office, don‚Äôt do it here. If you do... we may need to have a talk.

3. Have a clear start and stop time. This is where I struggle the most. Do as you normally do for work. If you come to work with a cup of coffee, do that. Don‚Äôt bring your breakfast into your office unless that‚Äôs your routine. Walk into your  ‚Äúoffice‚Äù at your designated start time, respect breaks the same way you would at work, and when it‚Äôs the end of day, close your laptop. 

4. I‚Äôm going to elaborate more on end of day because that‚Äôs where I really struggled with working at home. A lot of people told me how jealous they were that I get to work from home, but honestly, it felt that I lived at work. I was answering emails 24/7, always thinking about what I can work on while I‚Äôm making dinner, or preparing for my next day. In an office, you get the satisfaction of closing your laptop, putting back papers, and allowing your mind to shift from work life to home life while you‚Äôre driving home. So that even if you have to answer a few emails at home, you‚Äôve clearly defined this as you having to work a bit at home, and not you working in general. What I would suggest is closing your laptop at the end of the day, locking up/closing off your ‚Äúoffice area‚Äù and not entering it again until the next day. Unless you would genuinely get in your car and drive BACK to the office to complete something you forgot about, it can wait. Then, get out of the house to allow that ‚Äúwork to home‚Äù transition. Walk around the block, sit outside and sleep, I don‚Äôt care. But this is your transition zone. I‚Äôll sometimes go sit in my car and listen to a podcast. Consider doing this for as long as your regular commute is. 

Some of y‚Äôall may be thriving at your work from home life, but it loses its charm eventually. It‚Äôs better to prolong that enjoyment by integrating these tips in now than to find yourself annoyed and restless. Unfortunately, having kids is a whole other situation, especially because they have to stay home. If you have an SO who can split the day with you, try that. They handle them the first half of the working day while you work without interruption, then trade off. Get your most important and needy tasks done during that window of being childless. 

I hope this helps a bit, and stay safe y‚Äôall! The recovery time for this thing is amazingly long, and of all people with a resolved status, 15% of them resulted in death.

Then your SO seizes on this moment and changes the argument into 'You need to calm down. You need therapy. I am scared, because YOU are bad.'

You should address the lamp-breaking, and apologize for the lamp-breaking. But then shift back to what is beneath the argument - the core problem.

Moments can turn you into the bad guy/girl, and allow your SO to deflect the argument back to you.

- **Do not touch your face with the gloves!!**. 

especially eyes, ears, nose, mouth. If you learn nothing else, do this one. It renders them pointless. If you do, change them. 

- change them if you came in contact with germs 

- and/or change them if you are changing tasks and need to avoid cross contamination, for example going from handling food to taking orders with pen and clipboard

- in healthcare you put on gloves when you touch one patient and take them off after. You do not touch other surfaces if possible to avoid cross contamination, 

-  you should not just have gloves always on. In food service, you would do the same thing when switching from a task like cutting raw chicken to handling veggies

- Dont let the outside of the glove touch your hand when removing it

- you still should be washing hands!

-  Do not use gloves that have possibly been contaminated by poor storage

- It is not a replacement for hand washing. Medical personnel should still wash their hands between pts

- Gloves should not be wasted as a resource when not indicated

- avoid ‚Äúdouble gloving‚Äù, stuff can get in there that way

- take off gloves with a hole/rip

One way I combat this is by starting early in the day and by using this technique I'm guaranteed to feel less overwhelmed and actually get it done early or on time. 

Let's say the task is washing a sink full of dishes. This is my approach.

1. Fill sink with soapy water.
2. Take a break.
3. Wash all the cups.
4. Take a break.
5. Wash all the plates.
6. You guessed it! Take a break.
7. Wash all the bowls. 
8. Reward self with a break. 
9. Complete this pattern until task is finished. 

I find the hardest part is getting started. Things in motion tend to stay in motion so I can usually actually get a few things washed before taking a break. Sometimes it's just a matter of STARTING. I also find fast upbeat music that I like helps keep me in cleaning mode as well. Suddenly cleaning becomes fun. 

It might take me all day but the dishes *will* get done.",9,1585157627,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fouezk/lpt_how_to_get_things_done_when_youre_in/,LifeProTips,1

That‚Äôs stupid. Stop whining and complaining just because it‚Äôs popular.  Everyone complains about being bored before boredom could possibly have set in.  Social media and sites like reddit have made us all dumb, and shallow. Nothing that matters is happening in our phones or on our computer screens but we prefer them to real life and that is disgusting at a time like this. 

If you are fortunate enough to we quarantined with family, recognize this is the best time you will ever have together if you approach it correctly. If you are a parent you will never again be home with your children like this. This is not a burden. If you feel it is you are probably a bad parent. If your children want your attention you are fortunate. Put down the yeti full of booze and interact with your kids. 

If your someone‚Äôs kid, don‚Äôt be some petulant asshat. At least try to see things from your family members point of view. Consider that you have been such a shit that it‚Äôs you that needs to initiate the next steps to a positive relationship with your family. 

For those sheltering alone or those with truly terrible families, This is a reset opportunity. There are courses being offered for free. Many, if not most people, have the free time they have claimed to need to improve there lives and futures by studying something. Maybe it‚Äôs just for personal enrichment. Maybe it‚Äôs to switch careers. Whatever it is, do it. You may never have this chance again. In this isolation we are free. No one can kick you out of your home. Your electricity won‚Äôt be shut off. If the politicians get it together at all we will even get enough money to guarantee food for a few months. Get your shit together and set yourself up to be a better you when this is over.

fon0dx,521993Mj,25 years old with 2 kids by two women,"Hi I‚Äôm a 25 year old man. I work for Law Enforcement. I live in Memphis

I was previously married for 8 months to an emotionally abusive woman. We had a child together. We divorced and she moved to Florida.

I got in a relationship soon afterwards to another woman. We have been together for two years. She suffers from depression and anxiety. We‚Äôve been at odds ever since she moved down here.  She‚Äôs highly insecure and with me being law enforcement I do get attention. She had called off our engagement 6 times for EXTREMELY petty things. I have never cheated on her. 

This is where things get crazy.

She‚Äôs Arabic. And she is original from Jersey. When her family found out she was moving away they cut her completely off and it‚Äôs been that way for a year. So she has no one. Other than a few friends and my family.  

She called our engagement off again because two weeks ago one of my coworkers messaged me on Facebook telling me how handsome my son was. All I said was ‚Äúhaha. He get it from his daddy!‚Äù My word is BOND, that‚Äôs all that was said. She called our engagement off again.

So I got to the point where I was like fuck this shit.  And I made a tinder account and started talking to girls. I didn‚Äôt have any sex or make any physical contact.  I DID intend to make contact, have sex, etc. I searched up tinder advice all that. But I did not act on it..

The climax of this entire thing is the day she tried to commit suicide. We were arguing and she told me I was about to lose my second family in two years, which broke me down. I in return told her that I‚Äôm attracted to broken women and I need to choose better women.
That hurt her. Later that day she overdosed on oxy in front of our 1 month old.

I‚Äôm aware of postpartum but I hated her for doing that.  Seeing her lifeless body fucked me up and I see dead bodies all the time.  Things weren‚Äôt the same afterwards, and she recently found out about the tinder account (which my therapist made me delete)  and she went nuts and left me again today, and she‚Äôs already texting other dudes. 

We are currently staying together in my house, with our son. I would never put her out because my son needs to be happy and henceforth, she needs to be happy. So we are going to stay together.

My question is wtf is wrong with me? Why do I attract these women and then shit never works out? My therapist says that I am a fixer. I think I‚Äôm getti NV a vasectomy and saying fuck it.",2,1585126230,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fon0dx/25_years_old_with_2_kids_by_two_women/,LifeProTips,1

fol5zm,Ntdark,LPT: Due to the virus outbreak more and more people started using Zoom for work from home and video conferencing. PLEASE STOP USING ZOOM!,"Zoom has proven to be a major Security issue for people using it. Apart feom the webcamera bug that makes your webcam get enabled without you knowing it (only on MacOS), here ade some interesting facts taken from Zoom‚Äôs Privacy Policy:

‚Ä¢According to the company‚Äôs privacy policy, Zoom collects reams of data on you, including your name, physical address, email address, phone number, job title, employer. Even if you don‚Äôt make an account with Zoom, it will collect and keep data on what type of device you are using, and your IP address. It also collects information from your Facebook profile (if you use Facebook to sign in) and any ‚Äúinformation you upload, provide, or create while using the service.‚Äù

‚Ä¢You should also be aware that if a host decides to record the call so it can be played later, Zoom saves a TXT file of the chat messages from the meeting and shares it with your boss.

‚Ä¢Zoom allows your boss to track your attention during calls. This feature alerts the call‚Äôs host anytime someone on the call ‚Äúdoes not have Zoom Desktop Client or Mobile App in focus for more than 30 seconds.‚Äù In other words, if you are on a Zoom call and you click away from Zoom, the host of the call will be notified after 30 seconds, regardless of whether you minimized Zoom to take notes, check your email, or respond to a question on another app.

‚Ä¢In its privacy policy, under the entry ‚ÄúDoes Zoom sell Personal Data?‚Äù the policy says, ‚ÄúDepends what you mean by ‚Äòsell.‚Äô‚Äù


P.S. PLEASE STOP USING IT. Every Security Researcher is telling people to avoid it.

As you know, there's been a call in many countries for folks at home to start sewing protective fask masks for medical staff, loved ones, and to donate to elderly and vulnerable people.

The nonwoven mesh fabric used in surgical masks is called Polypropylene (brand name Coravin or Dipryl), it resembles teabag like papery mesh. It's very hard to find in domestic fabric shops, but there is one way you can  easily source and buy it bulk - super cheap, shitty duvets and cushions, the type you find in budget stores. They're made out of polypropylene instead of cotton. I found a king-size duvet in Poundland (UK) for ¬£14, and from it I have enough filter fabric to make about 200 liners for cotton washable masks.

My masks are 8"" squares of cotton and polypropylene, seen and turned right side out, pleated 3 times, wire added to the nose and elastic down the sides. Super easy to make loads!

fogjv1,legendnox,LPT: reuseable period cups,"I commented on this topic in a different thread last night and then I realize I should just make a whole post about it.

but during isolation and with hoarding it can be hard to manage a period . I know that supplies are low and disposable period items are expensive , wasteful and we don't even want to spend money on them in the first place. I would just like to inform everyone that there is a lot of reusable menstrual products that don't get advertised to us very often. These products are great for the environment most of them are extremely cost effective and don't cause tts like tampons 

Im talking reuseable pads. Cups. And period panties.


At first i was squeamish  And pretty doubtful about their effectiveness. After all I've tried natural deodorant and those are pretty shit. But this is not that.  This is like cloth grocery bags vs plastic.  It actually is an amazing alternative that works as intended . And like grocery bags the reuseable ones are built to last and often result in less spillage .

The cup

 It's a cup it's made out of 100% silicone they come in all different levels of hardness or flexibility and small medium or large sizes some of them are slightly curved and some have ring handles to pull them out easier. They last for 10 years + ...basically they last until you lose it or just feel like trying out a new one. It does not cause tts. You can goto ..the bathroom without taking it out and unlike traditional tampons it doesn't get feel dry or squishy . It works by collecting the mess in a flexible cup that you empty at your convenience.  You can insert and wear all day, 12 hours is the max recommendation.  Pros: everything? It holds alot of blood, its tiny, simple , reuseable and many say it shortens thier period compared to tampons (true for me personally  idk why this is i just know others have said the same thing)Cons: chaging it mid day can be a hassle in a public restroom but good news it you rarely have to change it out . If your new start by chaging it in the shower  or get one with a pull ring. Its a bit of a learning curve. You may have to buy a softer or harder cup if you have trouble with leaks but ince you find your match its easy. Putacupinit.com
 has a site dedicated to categorizing  cups from all brands and sizes so the research is done for you. 



Pads- bamboo with a water resistant lining.  Super soft , absorbent . You wear it like any pad but you toss it in the washer and can reuse them. Very similar concept to modern reusable diapers. Online you can 10 for like 20 bucks. Somtimes called mama cloths bc post partum women can use them as well. it comes with a waterproof storage bag but a ziplock would do the same that way if your out an about you can charge them. They last for years. Cons are they slide around more bc they have a button snap that goes around your underwear like pad wings and not a sicker lining. They are as thick as maxi pads but don't have so if you wear tight pants it could show. 

Panties-
 There are menstrual panties out there that are design to absorb a shipload most of them can handle between one or for tampons worth of blood. They are thin like regular underwear.  I personally like these as back up for my cup but on the last days i can just wear these alone and not worry about ruining my ""good panties"" bc they don't stain. Cons: upfront cost is like 25 a pair for modibodi or bambodi. Pros: its panties that don't stain,  leak resistant,  and actually contain accidents to the confines of your undies . Cons- chasing undies can be problematic , these are better for light days or as a back up. I use them insead of a liner.

I don't want this to be happening. I don't want this to be happening"" until I passed out. 

I expected grief to be sad and lonely. I did not expect it to be terrifying. And as someone who is accustomed to being her own rock, I was a little horrified by how much I lost control once I let my brain relax. 

I guess my LPT is: When shit hits the fan hard, don't be surprised or blame yourself if you feel differently than you thought you would. Be kind to yourself and others.

fock7l,monstermayhem436,LPT Request: How does someone get INTO a habit?,"There are many good habits to have.

Going to bed/Waking up early, writing in a planner, creating a daily schedule for some things.

But many people including myself have a hard time getting into these habits.

The habit I myself want to get into, is taking care of my teeth. While growing up brushing my teeth turned more into a chore than just something I did every morning and night. So I'd skip doing it one night, that became 2 then 4 then eventually I started to never/rarely brush my teeth at all. I might take a swig of mouth wash here and there, but that's all the care my teeth got. I'm 18 and my teeth are yellow as fuck and covered with plaque. I've tried to get into the habit of brushing them, but then it completely falls apart. I start making excuses as to why I don't need to brush my teeth. ""I might get a snack or a drink later"", ""I can do it later, it's to early"", or just being plain as day lazy about it. I've had stints where I'd brush my teeth everyday for maybe a week, but then go right back to skipping. Even now, I'll brush my teeth for a few days, then stop for weeks for no reason.

So how do I get into this habit or any other habit without it falling apart?",13,1585081904,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fock7l/lpt_request_how_does_someone_get_into_a_habit/,LifeProTips,1

‚Ä¢ Call your neighbors, your friends, your aquintences, your whole family. This is an absolutely historic event with enormous effects on the human psyche. People who were lonely before now face the most lonely period of their lives. Reach out. Show them you care about their life and their experience. You may have just saved a life. 

‚Ä¢ Give what you can. If you have something extra, give it to someone in need. The feeling of not having enough can be the scariest thing one will feel in their life. 

‚Ä¢ Be patient, and be understanding. Many people have buckled under the stress and are acting in unusual ways. This is understandable. This is the most contagious disease we have seen in at least 100 years, and no one was prepared for it. This is new to everyone. Help them understand. 

‚Ä¢ Be rational with your news. Misinformation can kill and panic. Take your news with a grain of salt and heed the advice of experts. This is not an us versus them issue. This disease strikes every family, every individual, no matter how you think. This is one of those times in history where humanity must come together. You are a part of this historic effort.

fo557l,jgugges,LPT - The washing your hands guide for your mind. Essential steps to staying mentally healthy while working from home.,"With COVID-19 forcing social distancing, many people who are working from home for the first time are trying to figure out how to balance being productive with the stress and worry that a global pandemic brings. While many companies have published very thoughtful guides to help you stay productive while working remotely (and I‚Äôll share some of my favorites later in this article), few of them acknowledge just how taxing working from home can be on your mental state. Addressing both productivity and mental wellness is more critical now than ever before.

As head of Customer Experience at OkCupid, I lead the Trust and Safety and Customer Support teams, who handle stressful and difficult content daily as part of their regular jobs. I spent over a decade of my career working remotely, so this is not new to me. I am also a lifelong meditator and have volunteered for the past few years as the director of a meditation center. The intersection of stress reduction, mindfulness, resilience, and work-from-home productivity is quite literally what my life has been about for the last few years, and I am happy to be able to share what I‚Äôve learned, in the hopes that it is helpful for those who have not had to think about these things before.

Almost everyone here could probably say they have a grandparent or great grandparent that is no longer here and that no video/audio record exists of them. What did their voice sound like? Their laugh? Their mannerisms? These priceless things are all only truly captured through video. I like many, spend countless hours researching the birth abd death dates of family members which is important but it is clinical history. Photographs are wonderful but it's a very different record. Video is unique. I speak this as a filmmaker and a lover of history. Pick up your phone or better, a dedicated video camera and record your grandparents and parents as soon as you possibly can. And if you are isolated from them due to the virus then have a Skype call record the screen using a screen capture software like QuickTime (free download).

fo1uv2,CheesyLyricOrQuote,"LPT: Have trouble getting motivated to cook and don't live alone? See if you can get your SO/roommate to agree to be a ""prep cook"" for you.","So recently I've really wanted to get into making Indian food/chili type stuff on account of getting an instant pot that I am determined not to let gather dust in a corner. Problem is that it requires a LOT of prep (at least more than grabbing a bag a bag of Doritos) and I'm usually not very motivated to do anything right after I get home from work. So, when I start to feel the hunger coming on, I ask my boyfriend to ""prep stuff"" (chop/mince/shred things) and it's ridiculous how much easier it is to cook. 

Not only does it mean that I already have the tedious stuff out of the way, and thus can make a complicated meal by essentially throwing shit into a hot bowl, but it also means that as soon as he's done, I'm forced to get up and ACTUALLY start cooking. This works especially well if you ask your prep person to start boiling water or something along those lines that can't be left alone.

Basically, imagine this: want some homemade Mac and cheese? Ask your prepper person to shred some cheese for you and get the water boiling, and you get homemade Mac and cheese with as much work as making it from a box. Sounds great right? And it works the other way around too, shred some cheese and boil some water, and boom - delicious Mac and cheese appears out of thin air, almost no work needed. 

And for those of you that live alone, get fucked.

Each go in depth, and test the camera quality, performance, durability and software currently running it, how it runs with games running, how fast it is with 20 chrometabs open etc.

You will be introduced to many companies you never heard of like:
Xiaomi
Huwei
One plus etc.

If you are a picture savy person, then find a phones that mainly focus on camera quality rather than speed. 
But if you are a hard core gamer then find a phone with more performance but focus less on the picture quality. 
Yes there are phones out that do that. 

The best part is Every year there's a new competitor trying to make a cheaper phone with better specs. WHY DO YOU THINK APPLE IS FINALLY MAKING ANOTHER IPHONE SE. because of their prices continuing to rise, people are seeing that are more better and cheaper phones out there. Which is a good thing because it's a never ending market where you (the consumer) wins. 

The phone I'm using now ([redmi k20 pro](https://youtu.be/e0J66CtsAUA) or MI 9T) always grabs people attention because how amazing it looks, including a pop-up camera.  Then when I tell people it only cost $300 and unlocked with 6Gbs of RAM and 128gb of storage it surprises them.

After finding the phone you want, I usually buy from eBay or Alli express or Amazon. Or thought the company website. I personally use eBay and buy it with the warranty (square trade)

This year I might keep the same phone because it's running Great. And I dropped it many times with no shatter.

fnztue,RedditAmulet,Need help dealing with stupid parents,"Before you say i'm just a idiot who argued with a mom.
I'm in my late teens and educated well, unlike my parents. Mostly mom, she seems braindead all the time and just so dumb, I wouldn't say this unless I really mean it. Her personality is so bad and stupid, she shouts and screams no reason and cries when in limit. 

 Example yesterday she made dinner and I had to go and eat it on the table, I took it with my to my room because my school work was in deadline, I told her that I had to do this hour because the teachers have to receive it that time, she keeps inting that I come to the table and eat when I kept refusing because I really had to she screams and start crying. I leave the room because she would follow me then I went to the bathroom but my stupid mom removed the lock from it because most of the time when im in there she keeps knocking and saying ""what are you doing in there let me grab my clothes quick"" obviously I was peeing or taking  sht. She keeps making these excuses and keeps slamming the door until I open it. Sometimes she grabs something and leaves sometimes she just checks and leaves.

I got a hold of the door so she cant open it until she leaves and calms down. There are cases when she is focusing on her phone or in her own room and she will not call me. She threatens to call social workers on me (which had happend multiple times) to fix my ""problem""
But little did she know that she is the one needing it.
One time we had to do a full month of conversation with the workers because my brother told the workers that my mom violently abused my in a trip in portugal.

We were going to a place in the morning so we had to leave at sometime, I was lazy and was sleeping, mom kept forcing me out of bed which I finally did and used the bathroom, I left the room and went to change my clothes before I got to do that she was screaming and hitting my with a shirt with a smirk on her face. Of course it hurted a little but I just ignored and had to hold the anger in myself for her stupidity. We werent even late when we arrived in there. She clearly knew when we had to go but she still went crazy on me.

She cant control her feelings and just does stupid decisions like today, I was doing school work on pc in the morning (didn't sleep the night) when I was in some  part she bursted out of bed and started shouting: I will call your dad you wont sleep, it wont work you will go live with the social workers. Obviously I didnt do anything, I did what I had to and there is no punishment for my act because schools are closed and we do it home, my sleeping schelude was bad anyway so I might just not sleep the night and sleep the next night better. Now im here writing this, my mom called my dad in the morning so early that it pissed him off too, my dad always sides with my mom because my opinion doesnt matter which i have many times to prove. 

My mom recently broke up with her boyfriend and started crying in the morning then calls her friends to come over then her stupid mood changes to happy. She then asks me to help her to transfer the data from current phone to her old because my moms ex pays her phone bills, she then gets mad at me because I said I dont know how to because i really didnt. I really wanted to say its your fault for being so stupid thats why he left you. But I didnt want the argue again.

What should I do? Should i just listen to her what to do until i get enough money to move out or just be my self and act correct in the situations",2,1585028515,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fnztue/need_help_dealing_with_stupid_parents/,LifeProTips,1

Luckily he had a check in his wallet from his employer that he had yet to cash. I call his employer to verify that he is an employee and is there so I can return it.

fnxx4p,-JG-77-,LPT The Google Chrome search bar is a calculator,"You can type most algebraic expressions into the Google Chrome search bar and it will instantly calculate them without you needing to even hit enter (however you may need to hit the spacebar at the end).

It includes basic algebra, imaginary numbers, factorials, percentages, order of operations, and more. It's saved me tones of time when I want to quickly add or average some numbers, or perform other calculations.

A lot of the symbols used for calculation will be obvious to some people, but in case you aren't familiar with all the symbols, here's a list of words and symbols you may need to know:

Multiplication - ""\*"" (""2\*3"" = 6)

Division - ""/"" (""6/2"" = 3)

Pi - just type ""pi"" (""2\*pi"" = 6.14...)

Phi - just type ""phi"" (""2\*phi"" = 3.23...)

Exponents - use ""\^"" (""3\^2"" is 3 squared)

Square root - ""sqrt()"" (""sqrt(9)"" = 3)

These can all be combined too to make calculations like: ""(3\*(pi\^2)+phi)/(sqrt(23))"" = 6.51124775

The idea is you get paper and cut it into coupon sized rectangles, and write things that you ordinarily wouldn‚Äôt do, that the other person might want to request sometimes, but ordinarily wouldn‚Äôt.  For example, for my wife on our first anniversary (paper anniversary) I made her 3 coupons for me to wash the dishes, two for me to vacuum the house, one for me to leave the house for 4 hours to give her some peace and quiet, five to take her shopping for a minimum of one hour for clothes/shoes during which I‚Äôm not allowed to complain and I have to provide constructive feedback on clothing she tries on, and of course one for naughty time and a couple kisses.

It‚Äôs pretty unlimited, because ultimately a lot of us are struggling or in need of attention, and asking someone to come wash your dishes feels awkward, but a coupon can be spent without feeling guilty, and it‚Äôs kind of fun.

fnmk8g,SewCarrieous,LPT for cleaning a child‚Äôs room quickly,"Or any room that has you feeling overwhelmed by its mess. I‚Äôve been teaching my child this method- and realized perhaps some full grown adults could benefit from it as well. 

Messy rooms have 3 main components: trash, dishes, and dirty laundry. 

First, remove the dishes and laundry. Now you are left with trash - and things of value that need to go to their places. Already you feel better.

Next, pickup the large obvious pieces of trash and deposit them in a garbage bag you carry with you. 

Then, use a broom and sweep everything left into one pile in the middle of the room, pick out the items of value, and put them in their places. For my kids room, this is barbies and books and Minecraft characters. For a kids room, don‚Äôt waste time trying to put each individual thing of value in a unique spot. Just throw all the things into a toy basket or bucket. Let the kid sort thru them later and ‚Äúfind‚Äù toys they thought they had lost. They seem to enjoy that anyway.

Lastly, sweep the rest of the mess into the garbage bag- and you‚Äôre done! 

Spray and wipe off surfaces - and vacuum/mop if you want to be extra clean.

It takes less than one hour to clean any room using this method. I like to put a timer on to limit

fnfc8i,dollyllama108,LPT: You can tell someone's not listening to you if they twist or ignore your statements in a conflict. It's therefore impossible to have a productive discussion with them. Walk off.,"We're all right sometimes and wrong sometimes. We've also all been in situations where someone finds it *totally unacceptable* for another person to be right and refuses to budge an inch from their original position. It's easy to tell this is going on when this person is arguing and yelling, but sneakier people can appear civil and tactful while quashing any chance of a meaningful resolution. Here's how to tell whether a conversation is going nowhere.

**You can tell someone isn't listening when:**

* **They reinterpret your statements to make them easier to discredit.** *(Example: ""I like X show but it had some issues."" / ""How could you possibly say these issues make X show bad? It's a good show!"")*
* **If you've made a point they don't know how to respond to, they ignore it.** *(Example: ""I don't like when you tell sexist, racist, or homophobic jokes."" / ""When have I ever made a homophobic joke?"")*

It's tempting to bring up the points they glossed over or to re-explain the original statement. But that's not going to do anything. They can't genuinely consider your position because they're not actually processing what you're saying. They're projecting what they *want* you to have said, which always happens to be wrong, and responding to that.

Once you've realized this is happening, you can choose how to deal with it. I've met people who end the conversation with ""Let me get this straight: you're saying \[repeat other person's main argument\]?"" and then walk off. I prefer to just walk off.

**More importantly, this is something we all do.** Monitoring your own behavior for these red flags is just as important as recognizing when they're being used against you. If you catch yourself in the act, reflect on why you're not listening---and why you're having this discussion in the first place.",18,1584945173,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fnfc8i/lpt_you_can_tell_someones_not_listening_to_you_if/,LifeProTips,1

So many university graduates and dropouts could have saved thousands if this was common knowledge - check your school's CLEP credit policy &amp; study!","Search your university/college's credit policy here:

https://clep.collegeboard.org/school-policy-search#

Like many others, I would have saved thousands of dollars and precious time on General Education courses during freshman and sophomore year of undergraduate university if I had known about CLEP credits. Much like AP Exams, except these are after highschool - you can sign up for a test for under $100 and earn credits for a variety of courses, often GE classes, at your university. 

Each university has a different credit policy, but I saw that my public California university had over 150 units transferrable from CLEP Testing alone. I was shocked, and for a minute felt pretty dumb for not knowing about these amazing options. While I don't regret spending summer nights at community college earning GE credits, this would have been much more preferable in many cases. I hope that if you're early into college or are planning to go soon, include this arsenal of class credit Pass/Fail tests in your academic agenda, and if you're in college and haven't finished all of your requirements, do a search &amp; see what's possible at your school. You might not be able to help yourself anymore, but you could definitely help a friend. 

I know this has been posted multiple times in other threads, but I thought it might be particularly useful for some people to study up on their CLEPs or be reminded that they exist during this quarantine.

fnbmpn,gumboslut,"LPT: If you‚Äôre now a student learning from home, establish boundaries sooner than later.","Students everywhere are being told to move out of the dorms and go back home for the rest of the semester due to the virus. After talking with lots of friends, the common denominator in our conversations was always that people are feeling very suffocated living with their parents again for the same reason: **boundaries** . 

Wether you‚Äôre in grade school or college this probably applies to you. It can be hard transitioning into living with family members that you have to answer to again after being on your own for a while and developing your own living habits as an adult. 

So here is the tip: Make a list of things you need from your new long term yet temporary living space, and ask your parents to make a similar list of what they expect from you. This is where you will be learning for the rest of the semester potentially, so ask yourself questions like:
t time? 

- Do you need quiet hours for studying? If so, when?
- Do you need a list of chores to do, or a way of communicating that you‚Äôre contributing around the house? 
- Do you need alone time? 
- Do you need a proper work space?

Have a gentle conversation with your parents about these things BEFORE there is a fallout.

Having known families that were both successful and unsuccessful with home schooling, I hope the tips below help.

**Set up school hours**

It's going to be tempting to let your kid self guide, but I strongly recommend setting up and following school hours. That means your kid has a time they wake up, a time school starts, a time for lunch and a time school ends. Do mix in some breaks and depending on where you live some outside time. Also, take away cellphones and other non-school distractions during this time. If your child finishes their work early they should work ahead or do something that resembles an extra curricular activity not have video game or phone time.

For older kids, you can give some flexibility in what the hours are but let's be honest, 4am is not the time your kid should be working.

**Set up a working area**

It can be as simple as the kitchen table. I strongly recommend to not let your kid do their work on the couch or in their bed on a laptop. Remember, the school time should be focused on school and free of distractions (as much as possible).

**Try to have an open line of communication with the teacher(s)**

Make sure that at a minimum you know what your kid is struggling with, what your kid enjoys, if their are behavioral issues and the rigor of each assignment. Knowing the rigor is important for understanding if your kid is full of shit or not with regards to completing assignments as well as identify things they're struggling with.

I also recommend asking the teacher if they have suggestions for videos on you tube. Along with the fights and sovereign citizen videos, you tube has a ton of educational videos created by teachers.

**Understand that you won't be able to help your kid with all of their work**

It's okay when this happens. If you followed the tip above then you'll hopefully have a way of communicating with the teacher or know of other resources.

&amp;#x200B;

In my admittedly limited experience, parents who are proactive in making sure their kids are engaged and completing assignments tend to have the most success. You don't have to hover over your kid all day but you should be aware of what they're doing and helping to make sure their days are structured.

fnaht3,v3621,LPT: Remember that isolation can cause stress and emotional strain. Practice being friendlier online during this time.,"I‚Äôve noticed in the past week Redditors have become insanely aggressive since coronavirus and isolation. I see people getting called dumb for asking if they can go outside, and others being called idiots for staying isolated. The conversation also has become condescending and degrading, for both sides.

Regardless of what you stand for (and you really should be isolating) there is *nothing* productive of being so combative. You don‚Äôt like that someone is still leaving their house? Try *educating* instead. The type of person not listening to a government during a crisis will not change their mind to the reddit comment you make (unfortunately), so it‚Äôs probably best to leave it be. 

Likewise, you don‚Äôt feel Coronavirus is that serious? Stop calling people stupid for panicking and politely say your two cents. People have every right to stay home right now and you saying they‚Äôre panicking over nothing isn‚Äôt helping anyone. 

I get it. We‚Äôre isolated, some people aren‚Äôt use to that and can cause so much stress. Some people have had to leave jobs, are home with kids, and aren‚Äôt being as active as they usually would be. However, we are going to be isolated for a WHILE. Attitudes will continue to rise on here if we allow it.

Whether you believe reddit is a great community or not, we‚Äôre still a community. I‚Äôve had so many very friendly/reasonable/logical/hilarious conversations with people on here. Not every part of reddit is toxic. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap because we‚Äôre all isolated and stressed.",22,1584923158,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fnaht3/lpt_remember_that_isolation_can_cause_stress_and/,LifeProTips,1

You can kill the coronavirus on your mask by it in the sun, but this doesn't kill everything that can make you sick.

Masks protect you by utilizing electrostatic energy with a combination of woven and unwoven layers of different fabrics. This is one the very many reasons why health care workers are frequently donning/doffing between patients: the protection wanes, but not that wonderful droplet protection that we all so desperately need right now whether we are healthy or sick.

A plastic container with a 5 recycle code will withstand the heat and pressure of a pressure cooker. Pressure cooker, Instapot, any number of those will do the trick. You can let it air dry or rest it in the sun. The material will degrade over time and this varies by brand.

Anyone who makes pickles or who cans food items will have one. Speaking from experience, these are a very common houseware in the Midwest USA.

Please remember to operate your PC's safely. Test the gaskets; gently tug them and work your way clockwise and flip it away from you, do it again. Run your thumb across the center groove of the gasket, opening it up. Cracks and tears are bad. Olive oil will help loosen it up if it's not making a seal. Put your mask in container, container in PC, pint or two of water, seal lid closed, crank to high, once it starts rocking turn the temp down. 15 minutes. Let cool. It'll take longer to cool with more things in there, like jars of food would take substantially longer than this. Never leave a PC unattended, despite if the box claims you can safely do so, and never open one that is actively under pressure.

fn5vun,celticdude234,LPT: Start a group text thread with your family. It can really encourage closeness and bridging gaps,"TL;DR Every relationship takes work. It will always help to have safe, open communication with your loved ones to allow collective and personal growth.

I'm the 4th child of 5 and my parents have been together 30+ years so I know that's a major asterisk to this advice. We were tight-knit growing up but in recent years we've drifted apart and became different people individually. I often resented their flaws rather than choosing to love them.

The past few months we've had a group text thread where we can all talk about what we're going through. It's made communicating between our differences much easier and even lead to individual growth. I've definitely benefited from letting go of my disdain and accepting them for who they are.

As odd as it sounds, it's also a safe place to call someone out on volatile behavior. It's always approached from a loving point of view and we're all mature enough to accept where we might be wrong.

Obviously this may not be an option for a lot of people. I'm fortunate that my family is both open minded and intelligent enough to communicate properly. We've never been VERY dysfunctional but this has helped to heal the drifting. But more importantly, this goes for every relationship, not just family.

There's a lifetime membership fee of $59, and that gives you access to the network of all the providers that work with OpenPath. 

Sessions with OpenPath providers range from $30-$60 (for individual therapy) depending on your specific situation, and it's decided between you and the provider you want to work with. 

With the current restrictions because of COVID-19, a lot of providers also offer online sessions. 

I personally use this service, and I can't believe it's not more well known. I've been able to get help that I otherwise couldn't afford. 

The least I can do to pay it forward is to try to inform people that there are options for you. 

Your financial hardship should not be the reason you are unable to receive care, and this collective shares that ideal.

OpenPathcollective.org provides you access to very affordable, and high quality psychotherapy. Depending on the therapist, online sessions are also available.",3,1584904614,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fn5an5/lpt_openpath_collective_is_an_amazing_resource/,LifeProTips,1

The latter part of that statement is a huge benefit. 

No need to buy a 10/20/100 pack of masks for one person though. Just having two masks is sufficient. First and foremost, we should only be going in populated areas when absolutely necessary, but in those events, wear a mask. When you get home hang it up and don't touch it for at least 24 hours. That's long enough for the virus to die if it's on the mask. Also, immediately wash your hands and face.  Have a second mask handy so you can rotate them in the event you have an emergency and need to go in public twice in a 48 hr period. If you don't have a mask, using a neck warmer, scarf, or handkerchief can also help keep you from touching your face. Just be careful when taking them off and immediately wash your hands and face and keep in mind that the virus can stay active longer on synthetic fibers like polyester for twice as long, so use them less frequently.

I'm a tax preparer in NY and have been deemed an essential worker largely because despite the federal filing date being pushed back to July 15th as things stand New Yorkers are still technically required to have filed and paid any taxes owed to the state by April 15th. Each individual state would have to make its own determination about extending its date so I'd recommend looking into your state's particular situation. 

Also, I cannot speak for HR Block or other preparation services but I work for Jackson Hewitt and know that we're going to be rolling out the option to file people's taxes remotely to try and give people the option to file with our service without having to come in to our offices at all. This involves getting copies of your documents through fax or email, a phone consultation, and having you e sign your documents remotely. 

If you're expecting a refund and you dont feel comfortable using free options (tax act is great and straightforward) or have a complicated situation I'd definitely recommend calling around to see if any local preparation businesses are offering remote services so you can get the money you're owed asap while so many people are out of work and could use every dollar available. Fairly certain Turbotax offers a paid option that involves video chatting with your preparer as well.

fmw916,Zach_Attakk,LPT: Learn the NATO alphabet to better spell things,"The problem with voice communication is that many letters sound the same. If you find yourself having to say things like ""A for apple"", that's exactly what the [NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet?wprov=sfla1) was designed specifically to prevent. It provides a way of spelling things over a bad connection without two words sounding the same. The word for each letter is chosen to be completely distinct and easy to understand, while being familiar to most English speakers.

The best part is, the person listening doesn't even need to know the words for the system to work!

The only exception is the number nine that's pronounced ""niner"" so it doesn't sound like ""five"". That's the only word that confuses people a little but is easy to explain ""nine after eight""

The whole sequence only takes a little practice to memorise and you'll end up using it far more often than you'd expect.

Anecdotal story: I was watching two cousins playing Battleships and they were accusing each other of cheating, so they ended up sitting in different rooms shouting coordinates to each other. ""B5!? No D5!"" over and over was ruinimg their game. Within 5 minutes I taught them A - H (8x8 grid) and the whole game went smoother! Plus it felt more thematic because it sounded naval! Didn't prevent cheating though, but that's not the point of the story.

* r/Anxiety, discussion and support for sufferers and loved ones of any anxiety disorder.
* r/Anxietyhelp, scientific articles, YouTube videos, Blog Posts, and more that are geared towards anxiety management and healing.
* r/Needafriend, a subreddit for people looking to make strictly platonic friends from nearby or around the world.
* r/ptsd, a supportive, respectful community for discussion and links of interest for people who have PTSD or have friends, family members, or partners with PTSD.

fmim3c,cwilliams6009,LPT Stuck at Home: SCHEDULE IDEAS,"If you're stuck at home and struggling to stay sane, take a look.

First, make a schedule each day, with time set aside for various tasks. Get up, get dressed (in real clothes!), set aside time for meals, for fitness, for learning etc. This works especially well if there are children in the house. Consider including these components:

* Decent MEALS: [r/sundaymealprep](https://www.reddit.com/r/sundaymealprep/) has some amazing inspiration here as does [r/Cheap\_Meals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/) and others. Use this time to learn to cook, and experiment with some new recipes. It's a life skill too many of us have let fall by the wayside. Note: IF you do order food for delivery or pickup, tip generously. Local restaurants are hurting right now.
* Daily FITNESS: Planet Fitness offers 20 minute fitness videos free to everyone. Reddit has tons of fitness oriented communities for support and ideas. Find a routine and use it.
* Daily LEARNING: Work towards that degree online with your local community college, that certificate on Udemy or Lynda or ALISON, or learn that hobby you've always been interested in on with Youtube vids. Do a virtual tour of a museum, livestream animals at a zoo, watch a YoYoMa concert online. Hire an online tutor! (okay, full disclosure here, I teach English for a living). Make a learning plan and stick to it.
* FOSTER a shelter animal: If you're in a position to do so, contact your local rescue to foster a dog, cat or small animal for a few weeks or months. Shelter workers are needing to quaranteen as well, and it gets the animal out of the stressful shelter environment and allows their personalities to shine through. You usually are in charge of feeding and caring for the animal, and they pay for all medical and other expenses. And if you do decide to adopt, the foster family usually gets first dibs. (Animal rescue people jokingly call this a ""foster fail"".) You can also check [Petfinder.com](https://petfinder.com/) for adoptable animals; many are available for fostering as well.
* VOLUNTEER: someone posted an excellent online volunteer bank with hundreds of online volunteer options -- please add in comments if you can find it. Or contact your favorite charity and offer to write letters, program, SEO or whatever your skill is. Get outside and pick up litter if the weather is nice.
* PASSION PROJECT: Some excellent redditor suggested this and I love it. Write a daily installment to that book you've always dreamed of, make your 1 year, 5 year and 10 year plan, make a business plan for your next venture, create a vision board. Also, make a will if you haven't already. I made my first at age 26 (that was many years ago) -- it's just good planning.
* RELATIONSHIP TIME: Facetime people. Have an online drinks party. Call your elders. Spend quality time with the children in your life. Write letters to folks in the care home (they are getting no visitors these days). Invest in your relationships now while you can.
* JOB PROSPECTS: Apply to your local grocery store, warehouse or delivery service. Many are hiring.
* LEISURE: Check your library website for hundreds of downloadable books, audio books, streaming services and etc. Many of them offer free access to online resources as well as lots of things to keep the kids busy. Consider a new game or streaming service.
* MENTAL HEALTH: We need you healthy!! If you're climbing the walls, book a couple online appointments with a local counselor or therapist, or go online to find options. Tell them the stress is getting to you and you need a plan to get through it all. Please take care of yourself.

fmh9us,BAMuck,This pandemic may save the world.,"Many people are panicked, anxious,  not knowing what‚Äôs going to happen next. We see production slowing down, the economy slowly staggering.... but is it all negative?

#1 is to bare with me and have an open mind. 

My point of view is almost 360. I see all the lives lost, all the jobs lost, all the people effected. 

I also see the grass getting greener, the air feeling cleaner, less crime, families coming together, and more harmony between species. It‚Äôs no surprise to me this pandemic is happening right now in 2020.
Because as of now, about 46% of trees are chopped down(and i doubt are being replanted), millions of species have gone extinct (because we feel so superior that we eat them), disharmony between each and every one of us (even with ourselves causing a war), and I see that this isnt natural.

#2 Another tip is to consider how you contribute to the madness, or the solution.

We came from nature therefor we should be with nature. Coexist with animals not eat them. Work because we love to, not have to. Get along because it creates more abundance in the world.

Tip #3 Get to know yourself better and where you actually came from.

This pandemic may change how we view our lives in a way that will allow us to evolve. You will see 80% bad in the headlines but also see some positive change as we re forced to not be such a disease to this earth. After this outbreak, we may change how the system works because this world can become more sustainable. The universe is giving us the chance right now.

Tip #4 Switch up a routine you have, and figure out a better one. It‚Äôll contribute to growth.

This includes any cleaner than contains either so be sure to read the labels. 

The¬†chemical reactions¬†involved in mixing bleach and ammonia produce extremely dangerous toxic vapors.¬†

The¬†primary toxic chemical¬†formed by this reaction is chloramine vapor, which has the potential to form hydrazine.1Ôªø Chloramines are a group of related compounds well-known to be respiratory irritants. In addition to respiratory irritation, hydrazine can also cause edema, headache, nausea, and seizures.2Ôªø Mixing bleach and ammonia also produces chlorine gas, which has been used as a chemical weapon.

Two common ways to accidentally mix these chemicals include:

Mixing cleaning products (generally a bad idea)

Using chlorine bleach to disinfect water that contains organic matter (i.e., pond water)

fmde5g,FalloutDad,LPT Request. Practical Ways to Stay Productive during a Pandemic,"Responding to a pandemic is uncharted territory for industries nationwide. I am blessed to work for a company that believes in doing our part to stay away from the virus, as we have all moved remotely. Normally, I am on the road three out of four weeks every month. While stuck at home, I am learning new ways to keep my productivity up and not lose the momentum we may have gained this year. I am striving to still grow and improve, making the best of the time at home. Here are several ways I challenge you to stay productive if you find yourself working from home during this trying time.
1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Continue learning. With everyone being home, most of us have extra time that can be filled with activities that promote personal growth. I challenge you to find something you are interested in and start the path of learning. It could apply to your job, personal life, or anything you are passionate about, including hobbies. There are a ton of resources out there for learning and further education, and companies are providing even more free opportunities while people are stuck at home. I currently just started my first CLF class with The American College of Financial Services. I am dedicating 30 minutes a night reading and studying the material.
2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Focus on your physical and emotional health. From most of the experts, I have read and listened to, being in good physical health is one of the most important factors of staying safe during the outbreak. Going to the gym may be off-limits at this time but there has never been a better time to exercise. It helps you stay fit and also relieves stress. I set aside around 1 hour a day to do cardio and weights. Since I am not going to the gym, I have been more creative. I have been running in my neighborhood or going to the greenway, doing pushups, sit-ups, dumbbells and weight machines at home. Going outside can also be a great way for families to share an activity, get out of the house, and still maintain social distancing. Eating healthy is important as well. Being home for us means having to cook more meals, and that's not a bad thing. It may be tempting to stock up on junk food and/or stress eat, but add more fruits and vegetables and healthy options if you can.¬†Eating less fast food is good for us all. Even the smallest changes can snowball into huge changes for your life.
¬†
Emotional health is crucial¬†during this time. Start with being aware of how you feel and how you react.¬†¬†It's normal and okay to feel stressed or worried about these types of situations, but it's important to manage it and find ways to relieve stress, such as exercising for me.¬†Connect (virtually, of course) with others in your community and find ways you can help and support local businesses or organizations while you are home. Helping others and finding meaning and purpose has been shown to greatly increase your emotional health. My wife is a big advocate for mental health and therapy/counseling- talking to a third party can help to relieve anxiety and there are different avenues for doing this even at home, such as telehealth and video conferencing
3. Set daily goals for yourself. Being in sales and traveling, I find myself getting bored at home easily. Setting daily goals, reminders, and finding ways to be efficient is critical to success in my current role. I set daily goals on how many phone calls I make, emails I send, LinkedIn connects I request, and make sure I hit them. You may have to work more hours, utilize technology, and find the best ways you can stay effective. This also applies to set your working hours and pretending you are in an office environment. I have four kids at home, and in-laws with kids, and I have to set boundaries that everyone follows while I am working. Though, I have enjoyed watching my kids and neighbors playing outside through my sunroom window. I see this as a silver lining as I get to be home with my family more than I have in a long time. We have also set some goals around the house for a few things to accomplish while at home... I guess it is finally time to repair the mailbox!
4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Communication! This applies to your workplace and home life. Technology nowadays allows for greater connections, almost as if you are meeting in person. Face-to-Face webinars are an effective solution when you cannot meet with your clients or your team. Phone calls are better than emails and video chats are better than phone calls. It puts a personal touch on a meeting that (literally) shows everyone is mutually invested in the meeting. Also, if you are managing a team, require your one-on-ones and check-ins to be through video chat. Sometimes getting dressed and out of bed can help motivate people.¬†Keep communication open. When you find an effective solution that can help your team, don‚Äôt hesitate to share it. Just as important, if things are not going as expected, reach out to your leader/mentor and ask for help. Doing both of these are great signs of being a leader. Maintain communication at home too, with clear expectations and conversations. Being stuck at home can be difficult for everyone, so taking the time to nurture those relationships with the ones you are stuck at home with is also important. Video conferences aren't just for those in the office- set up Facetime and video chats for kids to still talk to their loved ones and friends too, if possible.¬†
5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Finally, embrace the change. Roll with the punches. Be adaptive. As I mentioned this was uncharted territory for all of us and we are having to learn what is effective and what isn‚Äôt. If you try something and it doesn‚Äôt work, learn from it and change. There is no perfect advice to follow that solves all the issues you are going to face with this event. We don't know how long any of it is going to last. Change is inevitable and we must adapt or get left behind.",1,1584788859,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fmde5g/lpt_request_practical_ways_to_stay_productive/,LifeProTips,1

fmbe5k,justinevoe,"LPT: To overcome catastrophizing, practice mindful awareness and consider other possible outcomes.","Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion that spikes stress hormones, anxiety, and depression. The last two weeks have been the largest scale example of catastrophizing in the internet era. We've seen the stories using this trick - and are familiar with the catchy PR term ""sensationalist journalism"".

How to Overcome Catastrophizing

1. Mindful awareness - You have to catch yourself having cognitive distortions to be able to do anything about them.

2. Consider Other Possible Outcomes - Consider positive predictions, neutral predictions, and mildly negative predictions, not just very negative predictions.

3. Make a Distinction Between ""Significantly Unpleasant"" and ""Catastrophe"" - The key to overcoming catastrophizing is making a distinction between something being significantly unpleasant and it being a catastrophe. (Failing an important exam would be extremely distressing but it does not doom the individual to a life of failure.)

Use 1-3 to increase your perception of your ability to cope. - If you believe you can cope with negative events, anxiety will be much less of a problem for you.

My laptop was a secondary device that is 7 years old, sluggish, and had horrid battery life. I needed a minimalistic device that could fire up quickly, had a solid battery life, and I could work efficiently from. I wiped the computer clean, reinstalled the OS, downloaded maybe 5 3rd party programs I know I'll want/need, and now it runs like new!

My iMac with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB fusion drive was extremity sluggish but has far too many important files and software on it to have to start over. So instead, I cleaned off 300-400GB of files from it, uninstalled some old software, and addressed the number of startup programs I had going. The computer runs much more like I expect it to. Now, working from home is so much more pleasant and efficient. It truly has lightened the tension of the times and this may be one of the rare times we collectively have time to do something like this.

There's tons of other software types of tips I could offer too (editing the hosts file, using integrated cloud storage, using a blue light remover, etc.) but that's a whole different post ;)",3,1584759378,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fm85qs/lpt_now_is_a_good_time_to_spring_clean_your/,LifeProTips,1

fm6cg3,tehPeteos,"LPT: If you're using your own computer to work from home, you should probably be using a Virtual Machine to help protect your privacy, and maintain a healthy work / home divide.","For the uninitated, Virtual Machines (VMs) are basically a way of running another computer as a program on your computer, from your desktop. They have many uses and advantages, the most important one here being that anything you do on the main computer cannot be seen by the VM, and vice versa ‚Äì including screen sharing!

If you connect to your works network from your own computer, in most cases all of your computers web traffic will then pass through that connection, and your works network; not good. If you connect to work from a VM however, only the VMs traffic will pass through your works network ‚Äì helping to save you from potential embarassment, and uncomfortable conversations when / if you eventually return to the office - or the continent. Connecting from a VM will mean that the VM appears on the work network rather than your actual computer, so if you‚Äôre running - for example - a media server on your computer, it won‚Äôt appear on that massive networked TV they have in reception. Screen sharing mishaps can also be avoided as sharing from within a VM will only broadcast the VMs screen, and not your actual desktop.

If you have more than one monitor, you can run the VM in fullscreen on one and have your normal desktop on the other/s; if you only have one monitor you can run the VM in a window and switch in and out of it as needed, just as you would any other program. If you‚Äôve used any form of screen sharing or remote desktop connection before you‚Äôll have no problems using a VM.

It can also help with the blurring of the work / home divide. After working from home using your own computer for a while, that ‚Äòwork‚Äô feeling can occasionally bleed over into your general use; having a second computer to boot up for work - even a virtual one - can help keep it at bay.

Most computers nowadays will have no problems running a VM. There are a few tools available but my preference is the open source VirtualBox, links below.

[VirtualBox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org)

[How to create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-install-virtualbox/)

Once you‚Äôve got your VM up and at the desktop, [make sure you install Guest Additions first](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36500_01/E36502/html/qs-guest-additions.html). You can also allocate more CPU cores to the VM if you have them - [click on Settings, then System, then the Processor tab](https://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/images/trouble_vbprocessorsettings.gif) and adjust as desired.  

It won‚Äôt handle heavy tasks like video editing or 3D modelling, but it should handle daily office tasks and any screen sharing software with no problems at all - while also protecting your privacy, and perhaps your dignity, livelihood and sanity too. Even if you don‚Äôt connect to a work network ‚Äì for example if everything you do is web based ‚Äì it‚Äôs still worth considering for the work / home divide, and protection from accidental overshare.

Hopefully this helps at least one person avoid any extra stress over the coming weeks; have a great weekend - &amp; stop touching your face! :)",7,1584751723,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fm6cg3/lpt_if_youre_using_your_own_computer_to_work_from/,LifeProTips,1

fm22kr,ZoidbergNickMedGrp,"LPT: if your or your loved ones‚Äô advance directive (living will) does not explicitly state a preference to be placed on a ventilator, now‚Äôs a good time to update it.","Sit down, we‚Äôre gonna have a long chat ahead. 

There‚Äôs talk of a looming shortage of ventilators in the US if/when severe cases of COVID-19 becomes overwhelming and completely saturates all ICU beds in all US hospitals‚Äînot unlike what Italy‚Äôs going through.

Personally, I‚Äôm DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Intubate) despite being relatively young and without medical problems. The thought process is that if something happened to me that would necessitate resuscitation and/or intubation, it would have been EXTREMELY major and devastating enough that should I survive, it will not be without significant life-altering sequelae and a huge deficit in quality of life. I‚Äôm a quality over quantity kinda person.

So should I find out someone intubated me and put me on a vent against my wishes, and I survive living in daily constant agony that makes me abhor every moment of life, I would be disappointed to say the least. 

**Because someone else who actually wanted to be on a ventilator could have had mine, and both of our wishes would have been satisfied.** Don‚Äôt think you can express your wishes last minute before you deteriorate severely enough to be intubated; you may be intubated en route to a hospital well before you even meet a physician to express your wishes. Typically the moments leading up to emergency ‚Äúcrash‚Äù intubation and the period of time afterwards, the patient is considerably incoherent with varying levels of consciousness ranging from comatose to combative.

**An up-to-date advance directive is the only means of accurately communicating one‚Äôs exact wishes regarding end-of-life care.**

And just to be proactive, before any of you feel the need to chime in ‚Äúany kind of living is better than death,‚Äù you have not seen the type of lives of patients who survive major traumatic injuries or significant medical illness. I‚Äôve seen enough to convince myself ‚Äòcousin, that ain‚Äôt my kind of living.‚Äô I remind you to respect other people‚Äôs wishes, especially when those wishes are incongruous with your own personal wishes.

In the end, it‚Äôs about respecting each other‚Äôs dying wishes, and the best way to do so, is an accurate advance directive.

fly314,silent_femme,"LPT: With the millions of people around the world currently in self-isolation, now is the perfect time for you to set up a mobile wallet and stop using cash!","Although there's no conclusive evidence that a person can catch COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, I think it's best to play it safe and link your cards to a mobile wallet and go cashless and much as possible.

Studies have shown that nearly all forms of payment, from coins and cash, to debit and credit cards, have germs on them. The average bank note is home to 26,000 types of bacteria including E. Coli. and the average coin has more germs than on a toilet seat. 

All credit cards are susceptible to fraud. Last year a security analysis firm Gemini Advisory posted a report stating that 60 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen in the US in the past 12 months, and most of those were chip-based cards. 

When set up properly, a mobile wallet can be the most secure form of payment you can use. This is because mobile wallets use methods such as encryption, tokenization, and two-step authentication to mask payment card account numbers when you enter them and when you pay. With cash, you have no recourse, so you have no way of dealing with a product that was not delivered or was defective. With a check or a physical credit card, you have the risk of somebody copying those numbers down and committing fraud with them.

flxjp2,ThePenultimateNinja,LPT: First Time Gun Owners - Please Buy Some Snap Caps!,"As many will already know, gun sales in the US have gone through the roof in the past couple of weeks (we know this because of the number of federal background checks being processed).

The people panic-buying guns are not likely to be seasoned gun owners - we already have guns, and only tend to panic-buy when an anti-gun politician is elected or new legislation is proposed, and we buy guns that are likely to be banned in the near future.

Most of these gun purchases are going to be by people who may not have much experience with firearms.

Firstly, I would like to congratulate you - you have understood that you are responsible for your own safety, and have taken measures to protect yourself and your family.

However, merely owning a gun is not enough - you need to know how to handle it safely and use it effectively too.

If you can safely visit a gun range, please do so. Better still if you can get some professional training.

If you can't get professional training, ask someone at the range for help - you may be pleasantly surprised at how friendly and willing to help gun owners tend to be.

If you can't do these things, please at least buy some 'snap caps'. These are inert rounds that are used for training. They are deliberately designed to look nothing like live ammo, so you can't confuse them for the real thing.

Loading the snap caps into the gun, cycling them and 'dry firing' the gun will help you familiarize yourself with the gun and teach you how to handle it safely without any risk of a negligent discharge.

Watch some youtube videos on safe gun handling, and **make sure any live ammunition is in a completely different room** when practicing with the snap caps.

&amp;#x200B;

flvvt9,chichi_mcgee,LPT how to kill corona in your home,"
Obviously this will not kill the virus that is inside of a person. But it will however kill the virus that may have been carried in on a pet or coat (whatever you brought from outside idk). Use an ozone generator to sterilize your home. It will kill 100% bacteria‚Äôs and 100% viruses. Ozone is created by generating plasma (ceramic plate with electrical current) and fanning regular old oxygen over it. This creates unstable oxygen with 3 molecules instead of only two, like we normally breathe. These unstable oxygen molecules want to become stable again. So one molecule breaks off of the other two in process of oxidation. Killing whatever bacteria or virus it has come in contact with. This also creates fresh breathable air also while killing odors in the home (pet or other nasty smells). Be warned to follow directions. Do not stay in home or keep pets in home while using. Set it up and take a drive or hang out in the back yard. This can damage lungs if you breathe the unstable air. Slow time for oxidation to finish. Leaves no chemical residue. Ozone is natural. 

They are on amazon and where ever. Google ozone generator. They are somewhat inexpensive for what they do. Good luck everyone and be safe!

flvqh8,itsSavannah_Blue,"LPT Mom, I don‚Äôt want to but I will if I have to...","Okay so some months ago my mom lost her house to a fire so she, my 3 brothers (22, 16, and 8), and their 3 dogs moved in with my husband and I (both of us just turned 30 years old in Feb.) in our 3 bedroom house. We already have 3 dogs and 2 cats of our own in a relatively small living space. Needless to say, there‚Äôs been some tension and awkwardness from living in such a now cramped space. My mother works about 20-30 hours a week and my brothers are unemployed. My mother will occasionally clean things but she rearranges things to her liking as if it‚Äôs her house instead of respecting the way I already have things set up and when I speak to her about not moving our things, she kinda gives this light hearted half ass apology only to do it again later. To add onto this, my mother has a habit of turning on the eyes on the stove for heat. I‚Äôve told her at least 5 times in the last 30 days not to do that as it‚Äôs driving our gas bill up to where it has doubled. Neither my mother nor brothers help put food in the house or pay any bills so it‚Äôs basically like my husband and I just took on the responsibility of taking care of my family. My husband is uncomfortable with it but he understands the situation they‚Äôre in and he‚Äôs trying to deal as best as he can. Regardless of how much of an effort he puts in, I can visibly see the toll it‚Äôs taking on him and the strain it‚Äôs putting on our marriage. My issue is not there however...

My issue is with my mother and how she‚Äôs going about parenting my second youngest brother. 

Quick disclaimer: I love my mother and siblings dearly but when I smell bullshit, I‚Äôm not afraid to let it be known.

Anyways, he‚Äôs 16 years old and at the age where he wants to talk back, question everybody and puff his chest up at any and all authority. He has this really bad habit of cutting people off when they‚Äôre talking to him and I understand that he does it to get his point across but the way he goes about it is disrespectful. He tried it with me and I told him to stop talking but him being a little hardass, he kept talking. Now he‚Äôs smart enough not to keep talking to me about the situation so he started talking to my mom because she was in the kitchen when he and I started the argument. I told him to stop talking again because I know he‚Äôs talking to her about it is still talking. He drew his face up and kept talking. So I said ‚Äúokay, remember that. Since you don‚Äôt know how to listen, don‚Äôt ask me for ANYTHING and I mean NOTHING‚Äù. He shrugs his shoulders and goes ‚Äúso, idc, I don‚Äôt have to ask you for nothing‚Äù then walks off.

The next day when I got off work, I went to the store, bought a bunch of food, I bar-b-qued and made sides. I made enough for 10-12 people because I was expecting 2 guests to come over. Though my mom was there, I cooked and grilled everything completely by myself while she sat on the phone.

We hadn‚Äôt spoken since the day before but when my 16 year old brother saw me cooking, he asked me when the food would be done. I told him ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter because you‚Äôre not getting any. I told you yesterday not to ask me for anything so you can make you a sandwich, hot pocket, ravioli or some noodles‚Äù.....His mouth dropped open in disbelief and he says ‚Äúwoooow so you really gonna be petty with me?‚Äù to which I replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not being petty. I told you not to ask me for anything. You think it‚Äôs funny to not listen to people so I won‚Äôt be dealing with you anymore. You‚Äôre not my child and you‚Äôre disrespectful. You can eat, just not what I‚Äôm cooking‚Äù..... He was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cool then, I don‚Äôt want your food no ways‚Äù.... my mother was sitting there and heard what both of us said but said nothing in response.

Later when the food was done, she was fixing plates and started to fix my 16 year old brother a plate. I noticed and asked her who it was for and she said his name. I said ‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not getting any‚Äù..., she says ‚Äúso what? Is he not supposed to eat?‚Äù..... ‚Äú I said ‚Äúhe can have one of those ready made quick meals but not what I cooked because he doesn‚Äôt listen and I‚Äôm tired of it. I don‚Äôt do favors for disrespectful people‚Äù. She continues to add food to the plate so I say ‚Äúso you finna give that to (insert another brothers name)?‚Äù And she says ‚Äúno, it‚Äôs for (16 year old) to eat later‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúno, there is no later, you‚Äôre not listening‚Äù so she puts the plate down, grabs her plate and leaves the kitchen.

Everybody eats except the 16yo; he‚Äôs sitting in the room on the phone and playing the game. After everyone is done he asks me if he can eat now and I say ‚Äúyeah but not not my cooking. Get something out the freezer or a can good or something like that‚Äù so he smacks his lips and goes ‚Äúcome on why you still being petty?‚Äù. I ignore him. He walks off.

An hour later I fell asleep (about 9:30 PMish). I wake up the next morning and the plate she made for him is gone along with most of the food that I cooked. There wasn‚Äôt even 1 full serving left for me to eat and they drank my juice that I told them not to touch.

Now I‚Äôm pissed. Not only did my mother go against my wishes by giving him the food but they ate all of the food, drank my drink while I was asleep AND she turned the stove on for heat even though it wasn‚Äôt even close to being a cold night. 

I feel disrespected even more now and I‚Äôm contemplating kicking them out. I feel as though she purposely ignores my house rules because she is my mother and doesn‚Äôt feel she needs to listen to or respect me but I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre Jesus himself, if I told you not to give somebody something that I bought then that should simply be that. It‚Äôs not like I was starving him because he would eat those quick meals any other regular day if I haven‚Äôt cooked anyways. 

Backstory: 3 years ago, my husband and I first moved back to Atlanta after college and we stayed with my mother for 2.5 months while we found jobs and a place to stay. During that time my mom kept asking us if we found a spot and when we would be moving out. While we stayed with her, we didn‚Äôt eat any food from her house and were gone for majority of the day (we even left town for a week for a job seeking opportunity) so we never really made a difference in her utilities. We literally only just slept there. 

My mother and brothers have been here almost 6 months and I have not said anything to her about her plans to find a place. I know that with this Coronavirus mess, I know it‚Äôs gonna slow things down even more but part of me honestly believes that she‚Äôs not even looking for a place to stay anymore. I think she‚Äôs gotten comfortable with us taking care of her and my brothers and we‚Äôre tired of it. We don‚Äôt have kids for a reason.

flt64j,tbhntr,LPT: Advice for extended time alone at home,"I spent years working in Afghanistan, and have been in some form of lockdown (curfew, limited movement, etc) for extended periods of time while living in a tense situation. **This is what I learned from my mistakes:**

**Work out every day.** You go into this like a prison sentence thinking you‚Äôll have a six-pack by the time they lift the quarantine, but the stress of your remote work, caring for others etc doesn‚Äôt leave you the free time you thought it would. You are exhausted and stressed out. When you don‚Äôt get exercise, you stop being able to manage stress, you stop being able to sleep well, and there is nothing like insomnia to make you unravel. If you hate it, aim for 10 minutes. If you stop sleeping, know that exercise is the fastest way to reverse that.

**Socialize as much as possible.** Obviously from a safe distance or online, but it's so easy to fall into a pattern of work and TV, binging news, and self-isolation. Sharing your experience with others, talk, and human contact are critical. If you live with someone, (and therefore not practicing social distancing) make sure to hug them as much as possible. If you live alone, hug yourself, give yourself little massages, take long baths. We are tactile creatures and a lack of human contact can cause depression, stress, and poor health overall. Lack of touch can also exacerbate anxiety disorders and various mood disorders.

**Disconnect from the scary thing, and laugh as much as possible**: So easy to while away your days on twitter and news feeds trying to keep track of what‚Äôs going on. Terrible for mental health. Check in on that as needed, and then tear yourself away and feed your brain with books, and conversations with others, movies, and TV, online classes etc. Take advantage of all the stuff that is being made freely available, learn a skill whatever. Most of all, laugh. Watch comedies, read funny books, appreciate the ironies of the situations you‚Äôll inevitably encounter, write them down. Laughter releases endorphins, promoting well-being and relieving stress. Ideally, laugh with others.

**Help someone:** It makes you feel useful in a time when it's hard to feel useful. It's easy to question the point of your work when \*that\* is happening outside. Guaranteed there is someone nearby, literally and figuratively, who needs help. Put up a few signs offering to help those who need groceries or medicines, offer to walk dogs. Adopt a pet short term before the inevitable closure of shelters. Call family members, let stressed-out friends vent to you, be a safe space. If you have extra money, give it to someone who doesn‚Äôt. There are a million ways to help, and every one of them will make you and someone else feel better.

**Check in on your own mental health:** It‚Äôs easy to think you‚Äôre fine, mental health issues often emerge like the boiling frog fable. Stop, take a minute and ask yourself how you‚Äôre doing. Ask for help when you need it, and know that lots of mental health support services are available online, including therapy over skype/zoom.",656,1584702184,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/flt64j/lpt_advice_for_extended_time_alone_at_home/,LifeProTips,1

Painters masks, come in very similar varieties as do health masks and are just as effective as filtering out particulates.

Some places sell disinfectant sprays and wipes for car cleaning, they work on counter tops too.

You can also get gloves in various sizes both nitrile and latex.  These tend to be more heavy duty for engine work  so they will work in case you need the protection.

check out auto parts places like:

* Autozone
* O'Reilly's
* AdvanceAuto
* Napa
* Pepboy's
* Carcraft

check out home improvement/tool sellers like:

* Harbor Freight
* Northern Tool and Equipment
* Home Depot
* Lowe's
* Grainger
* Ace Hardware

There are countless distractions and it can pretty hard to get in the headspace to actually do the work

During this time that we are all social distancing and working from home, everything that is happening in the world can make it tough to focus. I just kept finding it hard to even start the work that I was supposed to and ultimately ended up procrastinating for far too long.

So I tried using the classic Pomodoro Technique. Some of you may know this, but its principles of using quick bursts of output and regular intervals were exactly what I needed given the environment that many of us are working in.

My simple process was

* Choose a task
* Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes
* Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings
* When the timer rings, take a short break (5 mins)
* After 4 ‚ÄúPomodoros‚Äù, take a longer break (15-30)

This was so so helpful to me and I think that this indefinite time being spent at home can actually be put to good use now.

flnguy,yaoj52290,"LPT: If you recently purchased a firearm as a new gun owner, PLEASE PRACTICE RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERSHIP!","As we are all well aware of by now, there is quite a lot of panic buying and stockpiling in preparation for the anticipated long-term effects of COVID-19. In addition to buying things like toilet paper and hand sanitizer, there has been a HUGE increase in firearm sales and new firearm owners.

**This post is not intended to discuss or debate gun rights or gun control.** This post is solely meant to objectively address the currently observed increase in new gun ownership and to hopefully encourage responsible, safe gun ownership.

**IF YOU ARE A NEW GUN OWNER, PLEASE SPEND SOME TIME LEARNING AND PRACTICING RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERSHIP.** Familiarize yourself with your new firearm's manual of operation; how a firearm operates varies significantly between different types of firearms. Establish a safe method of storage that works for your current situation and living environment; take into consideration not just yourself, but those who may be around or living in your home as well. Understand your local firearm-related laws. Do some basic research on firearm safety. 

**MY FOUR GOLDEN RULES OF SAFETY:**

1. **Treat every firearm as if it is loaded AT ALL TIMES.**
2. **Never aim your firearm at anything you are not willing to destroy.**
3. **Always keep your finger off the trigger until you are absolutely ready to shoot.**
4. **Maintain control of your firearm at all times, either securely stored or on your person (with the necessary licensing).**

At the VERY MINIMUM, please heed my four points above. However, I highly recommend new gun owners to delve deeper and to seek education in responsible gun ownership. In light of the recommended social distancing at this time, in-person training/classes might not be an ideal or available option. I've compiled some online resources below that should be helpful for new gun owners to watch/read/view:

This is just a short list of generic, beginner-friendly videos I threw together. YouTube has a plethora of information readily available to viewers. I urge all new gun owners to spend some time researching and learning about gun safety as it pertains to your specific firearm, intended uses, and living environment. Finally, please familiarize yourself with the your applicable local, state, and federal firearms laws.

If any new gun owners have questions, please feel free to DM me and I will try my best to help or point you in the right direction.

flhfmb,Premiumsargeantmajor,LPT: buy your new car from a dealership rather than through a broker/online,"I‚Äôm a Sales Manager of a busy Volvo dealership and I couldn‚Äôt count how many times a customer comes into my dealership after buying a car online because it‚Äôs ¬£5-¬£20 a month cheaper and doesn‚Äôt know how to do something.  

Cars are getting more complicated, with a lot of manufacturers focusing on the development of hybrid/electric engines, infotainment systems and safety features becoming more advanced.  Most people need to be shown how to make the most out of their new car and exactly what it‚Äôs capable of.

After you‚Äôve bought your car online, you could go to a dealership and ask to be shown how to use it, but we aren‚Äôt making money whilst we show you how to use your car.  To succeed in car sales you need to be focused on trying to sell a car at all times, showing you how to use your new car isn‚Äôt going to make us any money so we don‚Äôt really want to spend the time doing it.  Now I‚Äôm not an awful person, neither are my sales team, but we will make it quick and certainly don‚Äôt care as much as you‚Äôre not one of our customers.

Not to mention if your car goes wrong! Picture this - you‚Äôre on your way to work and your car comes up with a warning light. You bring it in and my service department are fully booked, can‚Äôt look at your car today and don‚Äôt have a courtesy car to give you.  You‚Äôre stuck.  Now if you bought the car from me and my team, even if it was 4/5 years ago, I would bend over backwards to keep you on the road and able to go to work, I‚Äôd probably lend you my company car for the day/find an unused demo to let you borrow.

You‚Äôre more than welcome to bring in the quote you‚Äôve received online, we‚Äôll genuinely do our best to match the quote but 99% of the time it will be a little bit more expensive.  Brokers work from an office, sometimes even from home, with a computer and a phone.  We have to pay for a showroom amongst a lot of other things.  But we will talk you through your purchase in a lot more detail, we work for one brand and know it inside out, they sell every manufacturer under the sun and expect you to come to them with exactly what you want.  We will also show you how to use your car in as much detail as you require and will do everything we can to keep you happy, at the end of the day we end up building a relationship together. Brokers want nothing to do with you after you‚Äôve bought the car. 

TLDR: buy your new car from a dealership rather than online if you want to be helped as much as you‚Äôd expect.",9,1584650645,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/flhfmb/lpt_buy_your_new_car_from_a_dealership_rather/,LifeProTips,1

A **silent disco** is an event where you put on a special pair of noise-canceling headphones and gather with others who have done the same. Then, as individuals, you can tune into one or multiple channels of sound, while simultaneously and indirectly combining energies with those around you.

People need to move a little bit and feel good while still have a sense of belonging. Syncing music is tough with connection and everything. Maybe groups of friends can log on and have a Google Hangout or something where everyone can mute their microphones but can still watch friends totally having the time of their lives and just sharing energy. Families, friends, couples, whatever. Go do it. No need to worry about being in the same beat or whatever. Just have fun.

Try to do activities over video chat that's a little more engaging. Having a meal, making art, making music, playing games, etc.

flc0c7,TheNerdyMupton,LPT: Working from home? Keep up with basic routines to maintain productivity,"I work IT, we've been working like crazy getting all of our clients set up for working remotely from home. All of us are, likewise, working from home.

It can be a little challenging to self-isolate and still be productive, but something I've found is that I am definitely far more productive with my day if I keep up with basic, every day kinds of routines:

* **Get dressed**: Even if it's not your full work get-up (like a suit and tie) putting on a good pair of pants, a good shirt, and shoes can put you into the work mindset from the beginning. It might be tempting to work in sweatpants and slippers, but try getting ready in the morning like you normally would and see if it helps you stay focused.
* Eat at scheduled times: Even though the fridge is *right there*, try to maintain a strict breakfast/lunch time as if you were still at the office. This is good for both productivity and your waistline.
* If you can, seclude yourself and stay away from the TV: I have an office in my home and we do not have a TV in it for a reason. It's a quiet place where I can close the door and focus on my job, even if others are home. If it's not possible, just avoid turning on the TV or put on a music channel or app like Pandora. Just avoid watching anything that you find interesting or even have to look up from your computer to absorb.

It's going to be weird for a lot of us for a while, but I think if we keep to routines we can stay productive and not go *completely* insane. Also, make sure to text/call/facetime with people.

flahxr,papahet1,"LPT: Whatever stage of life you‚Äôre in, be sure to take time to thoroughly enjoy it, and reflect often on what you have going for you.","I remember when I was in middle school and high school, I often yearned for the days when I was in elementary school and thought about how great it would be if I could go back to those days; the days when grades didn‚Äôt really matter like they did in high school, and if you got in a little bit of trouble, it was probably no big deal.

After I graduated high school and had a regular full time job, I longed for the days when I was still in school and wished I could go back.  Remember how nice it was to not have any real responsibilities?  As long as your homework was done, the rest of your life was yours to do whatever you pleased.  And every year, you had three solid months off school to do anything you wanted.  You could stay up late every night, sleep in as long as you wanted, and had no real adult responsibilities.  I would give anything to go back to those days for just one year.

After I got married,  and my wife and I bought our first house, we often reminisced about the good old days when we were single.  We could just date each other, we still lived at home, so our parents took care of a lot of things for us, we had no homeowner responsibilities like worrying about making the mortgage payment or mowing the lawn every week, and the world was our oyster; we could do practically anything that we could afford.

Now I‚Äôm in my late 30‚Äôs (although my body feels like it‚Äôs in its late 50‚Äôs), and the cycle repeats itself.  We have two kids (one with special needs), a mother-in-law with health issues living in our basement, and life is crazy chaotic.  I spend my nights in bed, wishing I could go back 7 years when we had no kids.  (Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my kids to death and wouldn‚Äôt trade them for anything!)  It was so nice when all we had to do was take care of the house, and we actually had the TIME TO DO IT!  We both had decent jobs (my wife stays home now), so we could do a bit of small-time traveling.  Once all the chores were done, we could go out to dinner or see a movie whenever we pleased.  Life was so much simpler then.

I‚Äôm sure in 10 or 15 years, I‚Äôll be laying in bed, wishing I could go back to the 2020‚Äôs.  Yeah, it sucked with that stupid Corona virus that everyone thought would be the end of the world, but we got through it.  Yeah, we had some real struggles when the mother-in-law moved in and we thought that period would never end, but at least then I had good health and could put on my socks and shoes without using a special tool that I bought off TV.  At least then I still had both kidneys.  At least then both of my kids were alive and healthy.  At least then I still had my parents that I could go to for advice.  At least then I was surrounded by loving neighbors who would help me if and whenever I needed them, even during the middle of the night.

I guess my point is this:  right now, while you have the foresight that at some point in the future, you‚Äôll probably look back on this time and wish you could go back to it, make sure you thoroughly enjoy today.  Maybe even consider journaling regularly so that if you ever question whether or not you wasted your time, you‚Äôll have physical proof that you savored these days, and maybe it will put your mind at ease.",13,1584626513,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/flahxr/lpt_whatever_stage_of_life_youre_in_be_sure_to/,LifeProTips,1

I think that we are born and die alone. This is normal, but nevertheless I will now try to describe my feelings. I'm not mature yet. (I don‚Äôt know if this is important.) I had to leave Ukraine (Crimea) with my parents because of political problems. Together with my family, I felt a danger to our life, because of our political views, so we decided to leave. Well, now, when I write this, we have already received several answers (refusals) from an organization that deals with refugee issues in the country in which I am now. Since, in their opinion, Ukraine is recognized as a safe country. And everyone around us says that for us it is impossible (or very difficult) or there is practically no chance to stay. But I understand that if we return, then at best, my father will be imprisoned. And it‚Äôs not clear what will happen to my mom. You see, parents are the most important thing for me in this world. I am ready to give my life for them. My mother always taught me that I should be strong, and always supported me. There are billions of people on the planet, but only two people in this world love me this My Mom and my father, and now I understand that I can lose them, and this is an unbearable feeling.

fl8lms,Slartibradfast,LPT Advice on managing extended periods away from the World,"I was a submariner for 6 years with multiple deployments of 6 months and other extended underways of multiple months with short in-port stints in between. In that time I had to develop coping strategies for dealing with the isolation and loss of social contact with the outside World.

Here's what I learned:
1) Hold fast to whatever is waiting for you on the other side. It doesn't matter it feels foolish, or whether there is certainty of it happening exactly as you plan in the end. Hope can deliver us from the darkest of days.
2) Be goofy AF. Crack jokes. Be odd. Let your mind wander when it needs to. You need to let that pent up energy out often. Channel it into whatever creative nonsense you can think of.
3) Food is fuel. Eat what you need, but ration the good stuff. You'll need the good rewarding pick-me-ups spaced out in time.
4) Make a time-keeping record / log. Put all your thoughts, poems, songs, rants, etc in it. Bonus if you can collaborate on it with others.
5) Share your thoughts with others and commiserate often. We are all in the suck, and it doesn't matter how much worse anyone has it. Your feelings are valid, and need acknowledgement.
6) Write letters to loved ones, and record videos for them to watch (and facetime now that that tech is available). I always felt special when someone went to the trouble of making something like that for me, and letting me know they care. And I felt good making them too.
7) Have a project. Something long term that you have to work on gradually. Education, making, hobby, art, etc.
8) Make and share playlists for your various moods, and embrace the moods you feel fully. Get all the joy, rage, pain, and everything out. Scream if you need to. Don't worry about looking crazy, because the World is crazy, and we are a reflection of it.
9) Get to know people that you would never talk to in your normal routine. They will change your life.
10) Reward your accomplishments. Because you are a survivor, thrill hunter, a champion, and a badass.

fl1az2,mud_tug,LPT: Bleach is an EXCELLENT Desinfectant,"These days finding an alcohol based desinfectant may be difficult. In which case you can use normal household bleach instead. You probably already have some at home. 

**Bleach is a strong and effective disinfectant ‚Äì its active ingredient sodium hypochlorite is effective in killing bacteria, fungi and viruses, including influenza virus ‚Äì but it is easily inactivated by organic material. Diluted household bleach disinfects within 10‚Äì60 minutes contact time. Stronger concentrations act faster.**

Most household bleach solutions contain 5% sodium hypochlorite. 

1:100 dilution of 5% sodium hypochlorite is the usual recommendation. 

**Use 1 part bleach to 99 parts cold tap water (1:100 dilution) for disinfection of surfaces.**

*Adjust ratio of bleach to water as needed to achieve appropriate concentration of sodium hypochlorite. For example, for bleach preparations containing 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, use twice as much bleach (i.e. 2 parts bleach to 98 parts water).*

**Preparation**

* use a mask, rubber gloves and waterproof apron; goggles also are recommended to protect the eyes from splashes;

* mix and use bleach solutions in well-ventilated areas;

* mix bleach with cold water (hot water decomposes the sodium hypochlorite and renders it ineffective);

* Use 1 part bleach to 99 parts cold tap water

**Use**

* Apply to doorknobs, faucets, floors, bathroom surfaces,   food preparation surfaces

* Personal items like phones, keys, jewelry, loose change, cards (but not paper money)

* Keyboards, mice, earbuds etc. including their cables

* Soak a door mat or an old towel with the solution and keep your shoes on it. 

* Items should remain in contact with bleach solution for at least 10 minutes. 

**Desinfection of toys and other items for kids**

* Boil some water in order to sterilize it and wait until it cools to room temperature.

* Desinfect toy by rubbing or soaking in bleach solution for 1 hour.

* Rinse thoroughly with prepared sterile water.

**Precautions:**

* Bleach can corrode metals and damage painted surfaces.

* Avoid touching the eyes. If bleach gets into the eyes, immediately rinse with water for at least 15 minutes, and consult a physician.

* Do not use bleach together with other household detergents, because this reduces its effectiveness and can cause dangerous chemical reactions. For example, a toxic gas is produced when bleach is mixed with acidic detergents, such as those used for toilet cleaning, and this gas can cause death or injury. If necessary, use detergents first, and rinse thoroughly with water before using bleach for disinfection.

* Undiluted bleach emits a toxic gas when exposed to sunlight; thus, store bleach in a cool, shaded place, out of the reach of children.

* Sodium hypochlorite decomposes with time. To ensure its effectiveness, purchase recently produced bleach, and avoid over-stocking.

* If using diluted bleach, prepare the diluted solution fresh daily. Label and date it, and discard unused mixtures 24 hours after preparation.

* Organic materials inactivate bleach; clean surfaces so that they are clear of organic materials before disinfection with bleach.

* Keep diluted bleach covered and protected from sunlight, and if possible in a dark container, and out of the reach of children.

In the wake of Coronavirus (COVID-19) and persistent measures to ensure safety for the public, select pharmacies are offering free prescription medication deliveries to help patients practice social distancing while still accessing their medications.

CVS and Walgreens Make Access to Prescriptions Easier Nationwide
CVS and Walgreens, including Walgreens-owned Duane Reed, announced last week they would be waiving delivery fees on eligible prescription medications.  

Neither retailer offers delivery on controlled substances or refrigerated medications. 

You must have an active prescription with your local CVS,  Walgreens or Duane Reed to participate in the free delivery option. If you need to transfer your prescription, you can ask your healthcare provider to move it or you can transfer it yourself. Be sure to give your RxSaver coupon information to the pharmacist via phone to ensure you receive a discount on your prescription.

H-E-B &amp; Free Delivery on Prescription Medication for Specific Texas Areas
Texas-based grocery retailer, H-E-B is offering free delivery on prescription medications for most Texas residents. Similar to Walgreens and CVS, all you need to do is call your local H-E-B and schedule your Rx for at-home delivery. Be sure to give your RxSaver coupon information to the pharmacist via phone to ensure you receive a discount on your prescription.

Check with your local H-E-B to ensure delivery is available for your prescription and your store at this time. 

What additional pharmacies are offering for rx delivery
While the above retailers are offering free delivery on prescription medications, other national retailers provide delivery services, depending on your medication order. 

Walmart Prescription Medication Delivery Options
Walmart currently offers free standard shipping on prescription medication deliveries. You can either send in a paper mail order form or call their direct line to speak to a Walmart pharmacy rep and get your medications sent directly to your door.

Walmart offers free delivery on standard shipping and select pricing on rush order options. Be sure to call your local Walmart for specific information on your prescription medication and delivery options.

Rite Aid Prescription Medication Delivery Options
Rite Aid offers delivery of prescription medications at select Rite Aid pharmacy locations. 

Use the Rite Aid store locator to determine if your local Rite Aid offers free prescription delivery in your area.

If Rite Aid is your preferred pharmacy and does not offer prescription medication delivery, be sure to utilize their pharmacy drive-thru to practice social distancing while still picking up your medication.

If your local Rite Aid does not have a drive-thru option, Rite Aid recommends placing your Rx order through the Rite Aid app so you are alerted when your prescription is ready for pick-up. This saves you time waiting for your prescription in line at the store and limits interaction at the pharmacy counter.

Kroger Prescription Medication Delivery Options
Kroger Health offers Sync Up which allows patients to fill multiple medications at once. Instead of having to rely on multiple trips to your Kroger pharmacy, your medications could be filled for a one-time pick-up.  This program also allows direct access to pharmacists for any specific questions you have about your medication.

Frequently Asked Questions About Free Prescription Delivery
What does this prescription delivery mean for me and my medication?
If you have a monthly medication or need to fill a new medication, you can utilize free Rx delivery options where available to receive your medications straight to your front door.

If you need to transfer your prescription or you are filling a new prescription, ask your healthcare provider to call or send it electronically to the pharmacy of your choice.  

Can I still use my RxSaver prescription coupon and have my prescription delivered?
Yes. Please call your local pharmacy and speak directly to the pharm tech or pharmacist to use your RxSaver on your prescription.  The pharmacist will ask for the coupon information over the phone, so make sure you have your RxSaver coupon or prescription savings card ready.  

Once the pharmacist confirms the coupon via phone, the medication will be processed for delivery.

What if prescription delivery is not available to me?
If your rx cannot be delivered you can still utilize your pharmacy‚Äôs drive-through window for a safe and easy pick-up. 

You can always use your RxSaver coupon at the drive-through window by visiting our website and printing out your coupon before heading to the pharmacy. Be sure to click ‚ÄòPrint Coupon‚Äô on the coupon page. 

If prescription delivery isn‚Äôt available, you may also utilize programs like Sync Up to ensure all your medications are filled at the same time for one easy pick-up instead of planning multiple trips.

You can also ask your healthcare provider to fill a 90-day supply of your medication instead of only a 30-day supply. 

Or you can make the switch to HealthWarehouse and order your medications directly online and shipped to your home.

fkr6yt,nusensei,"LPT: If you don't know how to pronounce someone's name, have a go and ask. Don't justify why you don't know.","It's always going to be awkward when you interact with people from different cultures and you come across names that you haven't seen and don't know how to pronounce. Some people may feel especially pressured to get it right, and inadvertently become defensive if they get it wrong. In going through this mental rollercoaster, remember to be considerate to the person you are interacting with and don't make it about yourself.

An example of a typical awkward interaction might be:

&gt;Is it...T-ang or Th-ang? T-ang Bah-wee or...Boi? That's a pretty hard name to pronounce. I don't know many people from Burma and it's strange to me. And, you know, I grew up in the southern US, so we don't get a lot of people like you here, and you know how we speak...

Here's the thing: people with foreign names are used to it. You're probably not the only person *that day* who has mispronounced it. They'll have their own way of rolling with it, such showing how to pronounce it, or offering an alternative name. Let them decide how to progress instead of digging yourself into a corner.

I don't expect people to get my foreign name correct (I'd be surprised if they did nail the pronunciation). Having grown up in an English-speaking country, I'm used to the Anglicised version of the pronunciation and I'm happy to teach people how to say it properly if they really want to know. But I don't need to be told how it should be pronounced according to you or why you don't know. Sometimes it can come off as patronising and condescending when someone from a minority is told why their minority name doesn't fit into the mainstream vernacular.

I often see YouTubers fumble horribly with names and go on tangents about why they can't say it, even with channels whose purpose is to discuss names. A short warning and apology is fine, but don't draw it out and make a story out of it.

If you're not sure, just ask. Make it about them, not you.",7,1584544868,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fkr6yt/lpt_if_you_dont_know_how_to_pronounce_someones/,LifeProTips,1

Today‚Äôs thought is kind of obvious - get dressed!  Just like your bedroom should be for sleeping and sleeping only (funtimes excluded), your pjs should be worn for sleep only.  Wearing your pjs gives your body the cues that it‚Äôs time to power down.  If you never take them off, your body and brain may never power up.

Sure, on your breaks you can start a load of laundry or walk the dog, but don't let work life and home life mingle during actual work time.

fkoyti,slimshadoow,LPT: Open the doors from/with the most unusual places/ways to avoid getting your hands infected.,"I wanted to post it in the megathread, but might just get lost in there since it can be a very game-changing behavior!

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, outside, your residency, the shop store, almost everywhere you go, there's doors! And doors can be opened by random people, or your closest ones. Therefore in this time of vigilance, you must do anything in your power to avoid picking the virus and/or contaminating people.

The following, are mini-guides to open doors depending on its type, helping you keep your hands from touching it.

Reminder: At the first occasion, wash your hands with soap or use a hydroalcoholic gel, and these tips below are to make it home safe without touching your face.

&amp;#x200B;

* Using a **door with a knob**: is like handshaking a dozen of people that came there before you, thus dangerous. *How to avoid that?* Use your forearm and pull down from the side. If it's hard to open, then use the back of your other hand or the other forearm, and pull on the contrary sense. (It's so obvious, yet some might not be aware of it)
* Using a **door with a handle**: same as the knob's effect, so you have to avoid touching it with your hand. *How to avoid that?*  Your elbow is there for you! And push with your forearm, but if it's a pull door, then elbow + the palm of your hand to pull.
* A **door with the bar lock**: Usually used for exiting and emergency doors, intuitively calling you to use your hand, and push to open. *How to avoid that?* Your hips! A little side move to unlock and push the door. If it's too high, use your shoulder or back, same concept! The doors that you have to pull with that kind of lock have usually a sort of handle ( like [this](https://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00SgdRcKrsMvqo/Industrial-Heavy-Duty-Glazed-Exterior-Interior-Galvanized-Steel-Single-Leaf-Powder-Coating-Security-Steel-Safety-Door.jpg) ) can be easily opened with the back of the hand, or one door goes in, the other goes out (use the one you can push, much easier).
* **Pushable door with no handle**: have usually a flat surface that tells you to ""push"", and you instinctively push from there. *How to avoid that?* Use the side of your fist at the highest point you can touch of the door, where usually no one touch, or even your foot if your hands are full. If it's hard to open, then use your shoulder, forearm, or back to open it.
* **Sideway door** (not the automatic ones, duh!): might look tricky, but actually easy. *How to avoid that?* If it got a knob or a handle, same concept as the two first guides. If a small sliding handle, your elbow is there! If none of that and got just an opening where you're supposed to use your hand? Then don't! Use your foot instead: tilt it 90¬∞ to your outside, try and insert your foot in between the two doors or the door and the wall, and then push! (same guide can be applied to eat ass!)

I know it might sound silly, but who knows, that can save your life, or the other's. And if you have other doors models I didn't cover, feel free to comment it, and I'll edit the post (all credits due to you, kind stranger!)

fkina3,bobberthumada,LPT Want to royally fuck up your social life? Give a fake winning lottery ticket to a person in need! Story included.,"So I have no doubt this will eventually get removed, but it actually might not be because I learned today that this was actually a common fucked up thing that happens.

So story time.

I work in a lab with about 35-40 people. I can't tell you what we do... but I can tell you it does relate to viruses. Anywho one of my co-workers Sarah (not real name) has a teenage daughter with leukemia. Needless to say having a kid with leukemia is extremely financially draining. Even with a well paying job Sarah and her partner still struggle time to time. They are able to afford treatments... but they really don't get to do anything more expensive than a trip to the movies. 

Some of us thought it would nice to start of the spring by going out as a company to enjoy eating out at a pretty nice hibachi restaurant... all expenses paid and you could bring your family.  We also thought it would be nice to give Sarah a few gifts as it was a few days before her birthday. Nothing too over the top just a nifty thing here and there. And then Sarah picks up a letter.  In that letter is a scratch off ticket... and Sarah scratches and see's that she just won $100,000 dollars. Needless to say she burst into tears about how much it was going to help her family that they could finally take trips and replace their car which was starting to act up.

When a one of the managers decided to reveal with a chuckle. Yah that ticket wasn't real. It was a fake prank ticket. You could tell by the back corner of the ticket in small print.

Needless to say that manager no longer works in the company and sarah well let's just say she took two weeks vacation; and I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't come back.

fkcp2a,Excitedtowork,LPT - Delayed Gratification and Money Success,"Watch a [video](https://youtu.be/weC64Gwfz1g) instead of reading :)

Delaying gratification is to resist the temptation of immediate pleasure and wait for bigger rewards in the future. It turns our ability to delay gratification plays a huge role in our money success. 

For example, by cutting down money spent on coffee shop coffees, you can save up and buy an awesome expresso machine. It makes amazing coffee at home and can save you money for years to come. If you cook more and eat less takeout, you can then save the money for a trip or put it towards buying your own home. Delayed gratification is helpful because by saying no to small temptations every day, you are preparing yourself for something bigger and better! 

Secondly, the most important reason that delayed gratification is great for your money is that money grows with time! Your money is a seed with the potentials to grow. When you put one dollar into your savings account, it earns interest for you. And the interest you earned will generate even more interest. So on and so forth, your money grows faster and faster. This is especially true when you invest it in diversified portfolios. By delaying gratification, you give your money space to grow and it will make you richer. Conversely, when you spend that dollar instead of investing it, you are missing out on all its future potential. 

**Three ways to get better at delaying gratification:** 

**Tip No.1** \- Put yourself at the optimal state. Research shows that healthy eating, sufficient sleep, and exercise can improve your ability to delay gratification. All these things can put more fuel in your willpower tank. 

**Tip No.2** \- Focus on your goals. Reminding yourself of the goals you are saving for is a great way to improve your willpower. By visualizing achieving your goals, you will find it easier to stick to saving. 

**Tip No.3** \- Surround yourself with people with willpower ‚Äì as social animals, we are heavily affected by others around us. If you hang out with people with poor self-control, you are setting a low bar for yourself. On the other hand, if you surround yourself with people who are also working towards bigger goals, you will find it easier to say no to temptations.",7,1584477764,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fkcp2a/lpt_delayed_gratification_and_money_success/,LifeProTips,0

 - If you finish a task, and you still have time left, take the extra time to review your work, tidy your desk, prepare for the next task, work on something small, like responding to that email from 10 minutes ago etc. Don't stop working!!!

- Your mind will start to race, kids, roommates, spouses, calls, emails and texts will try to distract you. Tell them to wait, or write a quick note to handle something later, call someone back etc. then get back to the task at hand.
 - People will start to recognize your time is valuable, and will know that you will get back to them, they'll start respecting your time. You will also learn to concentrate better and better prioritize tasks, you'll do less wandering working multiple things at once.

- Once you get good at it, start estimating work in terms of pomodoros (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break)
 - You'll then be able to analyze effort, maybe you're spending too much time researching a paper, not enough writing. Change the break down to 1 pomodoros for research, 2 for writing and 1 for review, take a long break.

There are plenty of pomodoro timers, apps, todo lists and browser extensions, or you can use it the way it started with a kitchen timer. It's a very simple technique that makes a huge difference in concentration, efficiency and effort given for tasks.",5,1584463034,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fk8boj/lpt_if_youre_workingstudying_from_home_youll_come/,LifeProTips,1

* ideally use a headset for best sound and be muted on default. However you input sound, make sure the program is using that source.

* know how to mute all, or unmute participants, this is critical to keep down disruptive background noise or help get someone talking quickly, as opposed to waiting for them to figure out they are still muted.

* preview any slides or pdf material to ensure it loads.

* set your desktop sharing to windowed/ app specific instead of full desktop if planning on sharing. If you need your full desktop, have the minimum amount of programs open.

* ensure chat is set up correctly and have it open on your end to review questions. An initial welcome note is helpful ‚ÄúWelcome to the Programming meeting, please remain on mute, we will begin at 11am EST.‚Äù

It is important and very useful, to have grip -even a loose one- on price trends of house, cars and these kind of things. 

So when you actually decide to buy, you will have a good grasp on whether the trend is going up or down, or prices fluctuated, or is this the peak time, etc.

You will be able to know current technology. In the future you would know what is coming from the past and what is necessary today.

For example, last time I used an automatic transmission car, there wasn't a thing called ""Hill-holder"". Nowadays it may still be optional. Yet it's almost life critical today to have that in your car.

This will also help you detect bubble in economy.

Eventually you will avoid overpaying for something that was one forth lower in price last month and maybe will go lower again next month. It will save you money.",2,1584457783,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fk6uc1/lpt_time_to_time_look_at_carhouse_prices_like_you/,LifeProTips,1

3. Even though it can make a trip to the bathroom slightly more cumbersome, it shouldn't matter; currently your best bet is to stay indoors.

fjoigz,cutekittensforus,LPT Make Irish Soda Bread if the Grocery Store runs out of Bread,"Irish soda bread takes less than an hour to make and it's a very forgiving bread. Unlike some bread/pastries it still tastes good even if you mess it up.

Here is the recipe I use : https://www.recipetineats.com/no-yeast-bread-irish-soda-bread/

I substitute buttermilk for 2 cups milk and 1.5 teaspoons of lemon juice (you can also use vinegar)

The bread rises through the release of gas cause by the baking soda reacting to the lemon juice. As such, it's important to get it in the oven quickly (within 3 minutes) once you mix the wet and dry ingredients. I recommend prepping everything you need before you start mixing.

this is also a great time to take these online courses if your university has shut down in person classes and begun online lectures amidst this coronavirus pandemic. i would highly recommend these to anyone and everyone because if i have the chance to save money and earn credits then everyone else should at least be aware. funny how universities and colleges aren‚Äôt openly encouraging us broke and struggling college students to take CLEP exams WHICH CAN SAVE SO MUCH MONEY, right? so if you‚Äôre struggling financially, but still wish to receive a degree, check out CLEP exams, they‚Äôre literally a godsend.",118,1584370865,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fjmatp/lpt_if_youre_studying_at_a_collegeuniversity_in/,LifeProTips,1

It got me thinking about a post the other day about working from home.

Just wanted to send everyone out there who is quarantined some ideas to stay positive during times like this.

1. Pretend you're working from home. Have everyone get up, shower, brush teeth and change out of pajamas (if you live alone make yourself get up).

2. Set a small win for the day. Go thru that closet, have the kids pick out their favorite toys and donate the rest. Make the bed. Handwash those delicates. Clean the place.

3. Stay away from too much TV and social media. Stay informed but don't get glued to it. It can take a toll on your mental health.

4. Do something creative. Paint a crappy picture, read a book, draw with your kids, maybe make a friend on Reddit and share language tips.

5. If you're able, go outside for a walk, if not, open the windows to get fresh air.

6. Exercise. Make it a fun family activity. There are plenty of things on IG and youtube from yoga for kids, to bodyweight exercises. Stretch, learn a handstand. You can also use canned goods for small weights and large water containers. Heck, your kid can be used!

7. Laugh, tell cheesy jokes. Try to stay positive but don't avoid recognizing your feelings.

8. Call people, FaceTime, text, snail mail. Help your neighbors out. Share toilet paper (ew, not THAT way).

9. Eat as healthy as possible, it will make you feel better. I know that may sound privileged but choose fresh foods when and IF you can. Drink loads of water. Moderation for junk and alcohol. Bake all the things and give some to friends/neighbors in exchange for toilet paper.

fjk9lk,couponcooldip,LPT: Saftey Measures for Coronavirus," 

**Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus**

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. COVID-19 is still affecting most people in China with some outbreaks in other countries. Most people who become infected experience mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others. Take care of your health and protect others by doing the following:

***Wash your hands frequently***

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

***Maintain social distancing***

Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain the virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

***Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth***

Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

***Practice respiratory hygiene***

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.

Why? Droplets spread the virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

***If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early***

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent the spread of viruses and other infections.

***Stay informed and follow the advice given by your healthcare provider***

Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow the advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.",0,1584362187,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fjk9lk/lpt_saftey_measures_for_coronavirus/,LifeProTips,1

fjg8ca,Dr0rtho,"COVID-19: What it is, and how to prepare for it. LPT REQUEST","COVID-19: What is it, and how do you respond?

COVID-19 is a virus that is currently spreading throughout the globe. It is a respiratory disease that displays symptoms similar to the flu but is much more difficult to recover from.
First thing you need to know is how this virus works:
It comes from a family of viruses known as Corona viruses. The corona virus causes a disease that specifically affects your respiratory system. The outbreak in 2003 of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are both corona viruses. The Corona virus family make up some of the cases of the common cold each year but the one we are currently facing is a newly discovered version known as COVID-19 (Corona Virus 2019).

How do you respond to this?

The first thing people need to do is not panic.

Stress or high cortisol levels are not good for your immune system. Stress can make you more susceptible and it will be harder for you to handle the virus if you get infected.
There is a lot of misinformation out there and over dramatic news focused on spreading fear in the community. The best things you can do is try and stay calm, and stay well informed. Safe places to track the progress of this day to day are at the WHO (World Health Organization), CDC (Centers for Disease Control) , and worldometers (Real time world statistics).
The main thing you need to know about COVID-19 is that it is not the end of the world. It is not the next black plague. But this is the first pandemic most of us have probably experienced in our lifetimes. We need to be prepared to protect those in our community who are at risk.
The way that we prevent the spread of this virus is by washing our hands. Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap. Every time you come in contact with an outside surface or group of people, wash your hands. Wash your hands immediately when you get home, after any interaction with another person, and when you touch your face. Do your best not to touch your face, it increases the risk of you getting infected and the risk of you infecting others. When you touch your face, wash your hands.

Washing your hands and not touching your face are very easy and safe ways to inhibit the spread of the virus through physical contact. This is important, as this virus‚Äôs incubation time is much longer than a normal flu. Current studies show that the moment you are exposed, the virus can take anywhere from 2 ‚Äì 14 days before you start showing signs /symptoms. You can be asymptomatic and contagious for 2-4 days before you start showing symptoms. Which means if you are infected and touch your face, rub your eye, scratch your nose and then grab a grocery cart or shake someone's hand you can spread the virus. You can expose another person to the virus, who can then expose another person. You may not be in the risk bracket for the virus, 82% of us aren't. But if we as a community don‚Äôt help prevent the spread of this virus it will start to affect our parents, our grandparents, our friends who are immuno-compromised or ones with respiratory conditions. And we owe it to them to do what we can as a group to slow this virus down.
All the events and public gatherings are shutting down and travel is being limited, not to keep everyone from getting sick, but to keep everyone from getting sick at the same time. This is called flattening the curve. Which means flattening the rate at which people get sick, because if everyone gets sick at the same time, our medical systems will become overrun and then fail. If the system fails, there won‚Äôt be enough beds to treat the number of patients coming in.
If we don‚Äôt act now and slow the spread, studies say that United States will have above 1 million cases by the end of April and over 4 million by mid-May. At which time death rates will sky rocket. The people who need care won't get it. That is the fear. And that will happen to any country that has not taken the proper precautions towards the spread of COVID-19.
For most of us this will be a more uncomfortable flu, but for those that are at risk it can be fatal.
If you are above the age of 65, a smoker (vape or regular), have a health condition affecting your immunity and/or your breathing. You are at risk. Make sure you are taking the right precautions to protect yourselves.
Everyone should make sure they have emergency contacts. Make sure you have friends and or family you can call if you get sick if emergency services are overrun. Contact your neighbors. Make sure they are aware of what's going on. The more people you can inform the better off everyone will be.
Things you should prepare:
As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world. It is important to stock up on at least 2 weeks' worth of medication for each family member, that includes anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, expectorants/decongestants and any other medications you might need. This

virus causes a respiratory disease so prepare medication that will relieve symptoms focused on that.
When cities start to shut down regular food sources will be harder to come by, either due to locked boarders or just public venues closing. So it is important that you have at least 1 months food supply. Water and toilet paper are not the issue, it is more important that you get nonperishable foods and proper disinfectants to keep your home clean. The best thing you can do is isolate yourself. So make sure you have what you need.
If you are a boss, or a teacher, or someone in power, please do what you can to give people the ability to isolate themselves, to work from home or study from home or just take time off until we have this under control. We need to contribute as much as we can to slowing down the spread of this virus.
Below I have provided a list of important facts that everyone should know, so you can help prevent the spread of false information and panic. As well as important things you can be doing at this time.

Things you should know:

‚Ä¢ COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a (new) corona virus.
‚Ä¢ The virus has been named ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2""
‚Ä¢ The disease it causes has been named ‚Äúcorona virus disease 2019‚Äù [COVID-19]
‚Ä¢ It is not the same as the common flu, it is from an entirely separate family of viruses.
‚Ä¢ Currently studies are showing that COVID-19 is spreadable by bodily fluids, through
physical contact as well as through sneezing and coughing. The virus is also now considered air born, which entails the virus is spreadable through an infected person exhaled air.
‚Ä¢ The incubation period (the time it takes for you to start showing symptoms) is between 2-14 days with outliers as long as 24 days from exposure.
‚Ä¢ 2-4 days before you start showing symptoms (asymptomatic) you can still be contagious.
‚Ä¢ If you get infected, let everyone you know that you‚Äôve been in contact with for the past 2 weeks. So, they know they may have been exposed.
‚Ä¢ If you are exposed, isolate yourself from others for at least 14 days. If you start showing symptoms, contact your family physician/ healthcare provider to find out what the protocol is for your region and how to get tested. After you have recovered, (no longershowing signs/symptoms) 14 days later go get retested for the virus. If you are tested
negative, you are in the clear
‚Ä¢ (If you cannot get the test, it is safer to say quarantined for 20 days after recovery unless
you absolutely need to integrate yourself back in because of work or responsibilities).
‚Ä¢ There is a chance with this virus to become re-infected after recovering, which means
you have to be extra careful what you do after you recover.
‚Ä¢ If you live in a family/communal setting, if a member of your family is infected, they
need to be isolated from the rest to prevent spreading the disease to the rest of the family. If possible, they should not use the same bathroom as the rest of the family, and isolate their movements to one room.
‚Ä¢ Masks do not protect you from the virus, masks are designed to contain the infection to an individual who is infected. They should be left for the medical professionals on the front lines who are exposed to the virus. If you have stocked up on them, consider donating them to your local clinic or hospital.
‚Ä¢ Gloves are only useful if you do not touch yourself and or face while wearing them and if you take them off before touching personal items and or disinfected surfaces.
‚Ä¢ Covid-19 can survive on surfaces up to 6-9 days from contact. Some materials like paper/cardboard only lasts 4-6 hours and on fabrics 24 hours.
‚Ä¢ Proper disinfection includes cleaning surfaces with soap, and then disinfecting it.
‚Ä¢ Isopropyl/ alcohol (above 60%), Hydrogen peroxide, as well as Lysol and Clorox products
can kill COVID-19, and are safe to use as disinfectants for this virus.
‚Ä¢ Hand sanitizers can kill the virus as long as the alcohol content is above 60%.

Myths:

‚Ä¢ Kids can‚Äôt catch corona virus. Yes, they can catch COVID-19. Data suggests fewer cases in children than adults but that is likely due to the rate of exposure. Luckily if exposed, the virus seems to only produce mild symptoms in younger patients.
‚Ä¢ It is a lot less likely to get corona virus than the flu. That is not true, as of today the rate of contagion for COVID 19 is much higher than influenza, COVID-19 R0 is 2.2 in comparison to that of influenza which is 1.3. So the rate of contagion for this virus is almost double. The rate of contagion is the rate at which the virus spreads from one person to the next. A 2.2 spread rate means that for every newly contagious person, 2.2 more people will become infected.
‚Ä¢ The virus is just a mutated form of the common cold. That is not true, it is a strain of a family of viruses know as CORONA viruses, most commonly found in bat species, as well as camels and a few other wild animals.
‚Ä¢ Boosting your immune system will help defend you from the virus, as long as you‚Äôre eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, are not stressed to exhaustion and you

have no underlying disorders affecting your immunity, you have a healthy immune
system. Dosing on vitamin-C and antioxidants is not going to change anything.
‚Ä¢ Packages from china can get you sick. The virus can‚Äôt survive long enough on the
package to infect you even if it was exposed.
‚Ä¢ You can't test yourself at home to see if your infected by holding your breath for 10-20
seconds, because this virus causes fibrosis. No, this is absolutely not true, Cystic fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis are respiratory conditions that have no relation to COVID-19. People with those conditions are at high risk if they get COVID-19 but that has no relation. holding your breath for 10-20 seconds will not help you know if you have this disease. If you have flu like symptoms with chest pain/pressure with shortness of breath. Then it is likely you have COVID-19. Shortness of breath will not be your first symptom. And it will be apparent that you are sick by the time you see that.

fjezag,joshem8,Might be better to avoid to order sandwiches (for now) LPT REQUEST," 

The title might seem silly, but due to concerns about this new pandemic, it may be wise to avoid chains that make your sandwich to order. Why? Because as they make the food, they ask what you want on it while your food is right in front of them. It's a fact that people can spit while they talk.. All it takes is 1 drop of spit to land on your food and then boom, you could catch the flu or corona virus..

I tried to get a sandwich today from the deli. I was a bit concerned about getting one because I just got over the flu and now have ear infections because of it. I decided to get one anyway because I really wanted a sandwich. I tried to give them instructions up front so they wouldn't ask me any questions, but was asked many questions anyway while leaning over my food getting toppings. Mind you, they were short and their mouth was right over my sandwich.

I still took the sandwich and finished my shopping, but in the end, I couldn't buy it. While probably highly unlikely (at this point) that I would catch something from this particular instance, at this moment I realized that I don't want to buy to order sandwiches.

So, I am curious to see if you think this is a lifeprotip or just germaphobia. Maybe its both?

Would you go this far to avoid catching something, or would you just ignore it and get the sandwich anyway.",1,1584332410,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fjezag/might_be_better_to_avoid_to_order_sandwiches_for/,LifeProTips,1

so i went out and bought a cheap mini blue tooth speaker at walmart. it's such a small speaker that i can put it in between the window screen against insects and the window door itself. so i would put the speaker in between there. close the window so the sound doesn't rebound into me, and then BLAST electronic music. i wouldn't super blast it, but i'd make it a decent volume. i let that run for like 3-5 songs. by the end of the 5th song.. guess what? no more TV :)

unfortunately that's how you have to solve problems in apartment complexes, jungle warfare. fight them back and make them feel some pain, and hopefully that solves it. i will note that i never blast music offensively. i only do it to defend myself. if she wants to start back up with the tv that's fine. then i'll start up the bluetooth speaker right on my window and blast into her. once she decides to stop, then i'll stop. i only defend myself, never attack",28,1584300881,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fj71e5/lpt_is_your_neighbor_harassing_you_with_sound_in/,LifeProTips,1
