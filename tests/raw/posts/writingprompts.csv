fsl1uw,ecstaticandinsatiate,[OT] Teaching Tuesday: Pacing Workshop (Part 2),"#Happy Tuesday!

Welcome back to Teaching Tuesday, friends :) I'm Static, and this is the second week of our first-ever workshop on Teaching Tuesday. In case you missed it, here's what we've been working on:

**March 17:** [Pacing](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fkcoa7/ot_teaching_tuesday_pacing/)

**March 24:** [Pacing Workshop: Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/foiibw/ot_teaching_tuesday_pacing_workshop_part_1/)

This is the last week of critiques for the Pacing workshop entries. If you submitted before March 24 **and** critiqued at least one other workshop entrant, you get to make it into the main post! Today, we have our last three workshoppers who met both of those criteria:

* /u/mobaisle_writing
* /u/codescramble
* /u/psalmoflament

##Hey wait I submitted some work and I didn't get workshopped! What gives?

I'm requiring workshop submitters to critique at least one other workshop entry in order to make it to this post. This is for two reasons. Mostly importantly, critiquing others is **the best way** to learn how to be analytic about your own writing. But the second reason is to make sure that we are evenly sharing the load of critiquing one another :) 

##Quick Review

My goal here is to look at the points we reviewed in the original article, which were:

1) Polysyndeton and/or asyndeton (self-quiz: “poly” means many and “a” means none … remember what kind of words you can have many or none of based on that?)

2) Description to convey time

3) Sentence and paragraph length

4) Character action and reaction

Like in the last post, all **examples** will be bolded so it’s easier to reference what I’m talking about, and edit suggestions will be *in italics*. &lt;3

Alright, let’s get this workshop train chugging along! 

##Mobaisle_writing’s Piece

&gt; He stared at it, swinging a glittering arc in empty space, and took a slow step back.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's not much else we can do."" Davis said, turning to Ashti. His eyes were skittish, head lowered, straining to keep from seeing too much. He began to pace, tracing a great circle around the centre, hunched over, restless.
&gt; 
&gt; **The void had that effect. Ironically unavoidable.** [Example 1]
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, Ashti was faring no better; muttered strings of arcane calculations and garbled prayer tumbling from her chapped lips, lights building then dying in tired eyes before she threw a phrase back. *[Static note: I’d suggest changing tumbling to tumbled so that you have an independent clause following that semicolon. Or keep the tumbling and change the semicolon to a comma]*
&gt; 
&gt; ""There has to be.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""There isn't.""
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps the scope of the problem was fully dawning on them, or perhaps he'd spoken with too great a force; either way, **silence gripped the room.** [Example 2] If it could be called a room.
&gt;
&gt; Certainly there was a floor, and it ended at a straight boundary, where walls might be expected. Yet they were nowhere to be found. **The floor had the mere impression of wood, laid flat in an endless void of roiling chaos, terminating in an 8m by 8m square.** [Example 3]
&gt; 
&gt; At one face, where should have sat a wall, a clock face hung.
&gt; 
&gt; Ticking.
&gt; 
&gt; ""How do you know if you don't try?"" Her words came slowly, carefully, as though being tasted. **Her narrow brows pulled tight in a look of consternation, pupils wide as though doubting she were** *[Static note: was, as “she” is singular]* **the speaker.** [Example 4]
&gt; 
&gt; ""You're acting like I've never tried before."" As he spoke Davis reached the face once more, *[Static note: don’t need this comma as these aren’t two independent clauses]* and glared at the oscillating pendulum.
&gt; 
&gt; A hand reached out, and stopped the steady swing. *[Static note: whose hand? Also, don’t need that comma in this sentence]*
&gt; 
&gt; For a moment.
&gt; 
&gt; Just a moment, the void itself seemed to hold its breath.
&gt; 
&gt; And then carefully, ever so carefully, he swung the counterweight back.^1

**What’s working well:**

This piece employs good use of varied sentence length and paragraph breaks to add tension and slow the pace in the moments it’s most needed, e.g. the last four paragraphs, which do a good job ribboning out this single span of time. 

**Example 1:** This pair of brief, clipped sentences in a single paragraph following the denser paragraph just before add some good contrast and vary the pace at the dramatic moment we need it in.

**Example 2:** “Silence gripped the room” serves as a concise and effective description to capture the unease unfolding between these two characters.

**What could be improved:**

I would be careful to make sure that the details in the piece are varied and precise. It impacts pacing when the piece reuses similar actions or observations, as it can 1) lead to a vaguely repetitive feeling and 2) the space for those details can be repurposed to give us more information about character relationships or the scene context.

**Example 3:** This isn’t really a pacing note, just a general observation. The asyndeton works well here, but the specificity of the 8m by 8m detail feels odd compared to the rather amorphous setting details provided before. 

**Example 4:** Almost all of the character-based details in this piece focus on facial expressions. I would consider varying it to show those reactions in other ways, as you can include other details which show the passage of time and character reaction simultaneously.


##Codescramble’s Piece
&gt; Davis said, ""There's not much else we can do.”
&gt; 
&gt; Cara held the knife pressed to the potato. She slid it tenderly under the skin, exposing the flesh. Catching the peel in her left hand, she placed it carefully aside on a napkin, wiped the knife on the towel, and looked up at her son’s gaunt face.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There has to be.” *[Static note: slightly unclear who said this, since starting a new paragraph separate from the actions Cara just performed can imply that she is no longer the speaker/actor in this paragraph]*
&gt; 
&gt; He grabbed the knife and the potato, edging her out of the way. Swish, swish, swish. The skins fell in great, sloppy chunks.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There isn’t.""
&gt; 
&gt; **Cara swept the skins from the sink. Grabbed the potato. Smashed it against the counter.** [Example 1]
&gt; 
&gt; ""How do you know if you don't try?”
&gt; 
&gt; He reached again, *[Static note: reached for what?]* but she dodged him.
&gt; 
&gt; ""You're acting like I've never tried before. I’ve looked everywhere. There’s no work. No coal. No food. If we don’t go to America, we’ll all starve.”
&gt; 
&gt; **Cara sliced the last skin off the potato, grabbed another. The last of their stock. She paused, and Davis held his breath, willing her to agree.** [Example 2]
&gt; 
&gt; A drop of sweat beaded at Cara’s brow, curled along the ridges of her haggard face, perched at the corner of her hard-set jaw. The drop tottered, tipped, fell. Straight onto the peel of the potato.
&gt; 
&gt; “Well, keep trying.”
&gt; 
&gt; Cara slashed the peel away.

**What’s working well:**

This piece implements subtext very smartly and effectively to communicate the tension between these characters. Rather than outright describing or telling us that the characters are avoiding eye contact, avoiding the uncertainty and dread and unspoken fears between them, the descriptions of Cara over-focusing on peeling the potato rather than looking at her son *show* us more than telling ever could. 

**Example 1:** The pacing of these three sentences accomplish a really nice, multipurpose effect: it establishes for us both the rate at which she’s performing the action and draws out the heavy, pensive silence between the characters.

**What could be improved:**

From a pacing perspective, this piece makes excellent use of time and employs its pace to communicate the unspeakable. I would look for areas to add a brief half-second for reaction time from the characters. 

**Example 2:** Here we see Davis react to Cara’s hesitation, which works well. However, I would advise adding a slightly more significant reaction from her. Or perhaps keep the action understated, but linger a little longer on the understatement. This is a pivotal moment for her: forcing her to face the reality of their last scrap of food, the fact that Davis is right, no matter how much she might want to deny it. Because this is a moment of crossroads—where Cara must choose if she will stubbornly stay on her own path or consider the alternative that Davis is suggesting—it is a prime moment to slow down time just a bit more. 

##Psalmoflament’s Piece

&gt; Davis and Anders sat down, tired and frustrated. Davis said, “There’s not much else we can do…”
&gt;
&gt; Anders looked up at the mountain of a mammal sitting trapped on the beach before them. “No. There has to be.”
&gt;
&gt; **Davis unscrewed the top of his thermos and poured himself a cup of stale coffee. He winced as he forced it down, sighing afterward. “Damn. It’s gone cold.”** [Example 1]
&gt; 
&gt; Only now did the day, otherwise a blur, begin to feel its full length to Anders. But the young man still held onto his resolve. “You’re complaining about coffee at a time like this? Seriously, there’s more we can do,” he said.
&gt;
&gt;Davis simply laughed. “There isn’t.”
&gt;
&gt; Emotions swirled within the hopeful youth. *[Static note: this wording is a little odd, mostly because “the hopeful youth” read immediately to me as the concept of hopeful youth, rather than being a description for Anders.]* Confusion and clarity, anger and joy, contempt and compassion each took their turn. Reality began to set in unison with the fading sun. But still, he tried to reason. *[Static note: you can probably cut this last sentence, as the next sentence shows the same idea nicely :)]*
&gt;
&gt; “How do you know if you don’t try?” Anders pleaded.
&gt;
&gt; Davis winced again, pulling the cup from his mouth. He looked at his apprentice with fiery eyes that were filled with the pain of many lost battles. “You’re acting like I’ve never tried before.” 
&gt;
&gt; Only now did Anders understand. **Several moments of anguished silence passed, before he asked his boss if he had a cup of stale coffee to share.** [Example 3]
&gt;
&gt; And there they sat behind the fleshy mount, the light in its eyes having set like the sun. In time, Davis broke the silence.
&gt; 
&gt; “Maybe we’ll win the next one.”

**What's working well:**

This scene is paced well, particularly with the inclusion of the coffee as a deflection from the pain at hand. It was smart to use the coffee again to show us Anders's change in perspective by the end of the scene. I also think the scene purposefully included character reaction before chaining it to the character's action in response to that particular reaction--particularly for Anders wrestling with his feeling of powerlessness. 

**Example 1:** This description is an effective way to slow down the pace and really reinforce the unspeakable subtext passed between them. It's smart to show Davis deflecting and pointedly doing something *other* than acknowledging the ~~whale on the beach~~ elephant in the room. Smart way to use character reaction in a juxtaposed way, as it shows us so much more about the scene and the tension between these characters than simply telling us would.

**What could be improved:**

Occasionally, this piece tells us that a character is experiencing a particular reaction, rather than using time as a tool to show that reaction unfold in real time. Paying attention to these key moments will deepen the emotional impact of the scene by making it cinematic, showing us the interchange between Anders and Davis.

**Example 2:** The placement and content of this line is EXACTLY what the scene needs in this moment, I think. However, the presentation of the content could be made more active by making it part of the narrative, rather than telling us that 1) silence passed and 2) Anders asked for coffee. I would suggest trying to make it narrative by including a detail that shows the silence passing--e.g. what beach sounds could fill that silence?--and then physically write out Anders asking the dialogue, as it would take up the same amount of words but achieve a stronger dramatic effect. Those tweaks would stretch out the pace to show us how the silence develops and causes that new character reaction from Anders.

##First workshop: complete!

And that's it, friends! That's the end of our first workshop week! 

What did you think Did you enjoy the process? Did you find it helpful? Comment down below if there's anything you particularly liked or any part of the process that could be improved or streamlined.

Additionally, let me know which of these sounds more interesting to you as focuses for next week's workshop: 

* using subtext (communicating between the lines in what characters *don't* say but we the audience understand),
* practicing point of view, or
* active language beyond passive vs active voice -- because there's so much more to it than just that 

I want to do all of these moving into the future, but it's all a matter of choosing which we *start* with.

Thank you all of you who read along for making this such a fun and meaningful experience for all of us. Special thanks to those who tried out the workshop, and extra special thanks if you critiqued others :) I'm so grateful for all of you!",9,1585687902,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fsl1uw/ot_teaching_tuesday_pacing_workshop_part_2/,WritingPrompts,3

--- 


Lila tossed the chicken bone into the fire and pushed her toes closer to the flame. The days here were blazing hot, and the nights temperate, but she hadn’t been able to shake the chill that set into her bones just after they passed through a city that had once been called Neworleans. From the other side of the campfire, Nate raised his eyebrow at her. Lila shrugged in reply and wrapped her arms around herself. A nagging ache pressed at her head, but she wasn’t going to let it slow her down. Not when they’d come this far. 

Nate pulled his eyes off Lila and turned back to the others around the campfire. It was a strange lot of them: Nate and Lila, the archeologists; Mia, the engineer with spiky dark hair; Gray, the mechanic-extraordinaire-slash-drive-slash-leader; and the newest addition, Arnie, the local guide they hired to bring them through the swampy land called Florida. The red light from the fire cast deep shadows over all their faces. A mosquito buzzed by her ear and she slapped it against her neck. When she pulled down her hand, a dark smear marked the pad of her middle finger. Lila wiped it against the canvas of her pants and tried not to think about the danger it could bring. 

“Lila?” Nate said. He was staring at her in earnest now. “You okay?”

Lila bobbed her head up and down. “Just a long day.”

Mia hummed in agreement. “You can fucking say that again. I’ve got half a mind to walk back West instead of sitting in that hunk of shit again.”

The Jeep they used was old. Lila would admit that it did fall firmly into the ‘hunk of shit’ category. In all honesty, she was surprised it hadn’t been stripped down for scrap, let alone that it had brought them across the country. 

“Hey,” Gray protested. “It’s a relic. It’s vintage.”

“So are airplanes but you don’t see anyone using those anymore,” Nate countered. 

“I seen an airplane fly,” Arnie said. The group quieted and turned to him. His words were clipped and strange--steeped in a strange accent that Lila had to work to understand. 

“No plane has flown in eighty years,” Gray said. He was oddly still. 

Arnie shook his head vehemently. “Nah, nah. Not true. I seen it when I was a teen. Big old bird-like thing, just flying through the skies. Every day for a month and then--” he raised his hands and splayed his crooked fingers wide-- “boom. Disappears as quick as it came.”

Lila saw Gray open his mouth again.

“That must’ve been quite the sight,” she said before he could speak. The last thing they needed was to piss off a local guide. Arnie nodded along in the flickering light while Gray grumbled with annoyance.

Gray liked his world with a sense of order. He saw the parts and put them together until everything hummed. Everything had its place. Gray and the rest of them all knew the story of the last airplane. It was one of the most common stories passed around--nearly everyone heard the story for the first time as a kid. It was a story of the last days. A time when the skies had been black with ash and the planes had been down for fifteen years. The first break came in the cover. Instead of helping the people, the President took off in his airplane. No one knew where he went. Lila had heard every theory: the one where he went to Spain and the one where he went to Argentina and the one where the plane took off empty to disguise the fact he’d died of dysentery in the dark years. It wasn’t only a story; it was a fact. To suggest otherwise--in Gray’s eyes--was something akin to blasphemy. 

“Well,” Lila said as she clapped her hands against her legs. “It has been a long day. I should really get some rest.”

The others nodded and Nate stood. “Me too.”

Lila rolled her eyes. There wasn’t any point trying to keep their relationship a secret (they all lived in too close quarters for that) but they hadn’t acknowledged it outright, either. A romantic tryst on an expedition to the Outlands was one thing. A full-blown relationship was another. 

“Night,” Arnie said, tipping his head. “Mind that the Floridaman doesn’t get you.” 

Lila shot Nate a confused look. Nate leaned in and whispered, “it’s a legend. Like the boogieman. Parents out here use it to stop their kids from acting out. You know? Be home before dark or the Floridaman will get you.”

Silently, Lila nodded. These parts were full of stories. It was all they had when the world went to shit. Sometimes, Lila wondered if the world really used to be as strange as the stories claimed it was. It seemed impossible. But there was a strangeness in the air down in these parts. 

Lila hauled her bag from the Jeep and turned to Nate. “Do you ever think we’d have been better off if we stayed in the Midlands?” she asked him, not for the first time. 

Nate sighed and pushed his dark hair back from his brow. “We’ve got to find the pieces of the old world if we ever want to put it back together. Someone’s gotta do it.” 

She nodded and shouldered her bag. Nate had given that answer before. He never answered her question directly. Lila suspected that was because his answer would be ‘yes’. 


---


The next day, they made good time cruising over the rough roads--there wasn’t a cloud in the sky to blot out the solar panels strapped to the roof of the Jeep. They rode shoulder to shoulder in the cab. Despite the chill deep in Lila’s core, she still felt the heat and humidity of the day. Her hair curled and clung to her neck. Patches of dampness gathered under her armpits. She was long past the point of caring. 

When the ocean peaked out on the horizon, Lila squeezed Nate’s arm. She’d seen the coast dozens of times (which was a dozen more than most Midlanders had) but it never failed to stir something up in her chest. Part of it, Lila thought, was reverence at the stunning beauty of it all. But there was another equal part that she couldn’t place. She wanted only to set out in a boat and lose herself in the blue endlessness.

“Do you think there are people out there still? On the other side?” she asked. 

Nate shrugged. “Does it make a difference?” 

“I guess not.” Lila watched the land change out the window until the land faded to the Cape. It was little more than a sandbar and the asphalt of the road cleaved up in chunks and broke away.

Gray shifted the gears and the Jeep ground to a halt. “This is as far as she’ll go. I’m not chancing it on a washed-out road.” 

They all nodded, gathered their gear, and trudged out over the Cape, Arnie in front. He didn’t seem to mind the blistering heat. 

Mia craned her inland as she walked. Her hand bounced against the strap of her bag--she’d been telling tales of the Cape the whole expedition. The place was mythical for everyone, but for Mia? It was a holy place. The land where humans harnessed fire. Where they learned the secrets to touch the stars. Lila often wondered how true it could be. It seemed an impossible thing, but the old world was full of impossible things. 

“Now,” Arnie said as they came up to a section of a rusted metal fence, “this is where I leave you.” 

Mia turned and looked at him as if he’d sprouted wings. “Don’t you want to see what’s on the other side? I mean--this place! It’s the stuff of legend.”

Arnie crossed his arms and shook his head. His sun withered skin made him look older than his years, but his head was still full of shaggy blond hair. “That’s why I’m not going forward--” he lowered his voice and leaned in-- “it’s because of the stories. You know. They say this is where humans took to the sky. But you know the part they leave out? The humans swore to come back.”

A jolt of electricity sparked up Lila’s spine. “I’ve never heard that part before,” she said, her voice a whisper in the sea breeze. 

“Li,” Nate started, but she waved him off. 

“But it’s truth.” He stared up at the blue sky as if he was searching for a trace of them now. “They left when the skies turned black.”

“I know.” Lila had heard that much a dozen times before. 

“They had domes on the moon. Houses on stars. Made to keep them rich folks safe while we die down here.”

“That’s what the stories say,” Nate said, his voice steeped in annoyance. Lila knew him well enough to understand his mood. He wanted to get digging. Lila elbowed his side; Nate should know better than anyone that all stories were important. Even if they weren’t *true* in the factual sense, they revealed the values of the culture.

“But they can’t live up there forever,” Arnie continued. 

“Why not?” Nate tossed his arms to his sides. “Why give up the luxuries of the old world for this?”

“And you’d stay in a storm shelter after the wind dies?”

Nate shut up. Under his warm skin, a light pink botted his cheeks. 

Mia huffed. “But that doesn’t explain why *you* don’t want to come. Don’t you want to see these places?” She gestured forward. 

“Stories say they’re coming back soon.” Arnie’s eyes looked far away and watery. “I don’t want to meet those people. If you can even call them that. Do you know what they had to do to get on those ships? You might not get those stories in the Midlands. But here? We don’t forget.” 

Lila felt the chill at her core spread to her limbs. The realization clicked together in her head as if it were one of Gray’s machines. “They’re not coming back in peace.” 

“They’re coming back to take what they’ve missed. It’s not a promise to return. It’s a threat,” Arnie said. 

The blood in Lila’s ears pounded. Across the Cape, a gust of wind blew. It stole sand from the breaches and scattered it in the air. The long grasses bent along, flowing in waves like the sea.

The strangeness of the Cape rolled through Lila's chest and left her hollow.

I guess we should stay at home for a while until we find a cure or something, well it's been more than two weeks now I miss going out meeting my friends. Nowadays we talk through video calls, I've reconnected again with my high school friends and everything is going great hopefully; Nah who am I kidding, yes she's there, yes she is that same beautiful woman and yeah she took my breath away when I saw her, me and her shouldn't be together at the same place that's what I'm always telling myself it's like that jar full of candies and I'm that fat kid who would eat it all but at the end of the day, I'm the one who's having a toothache. Well I should stay away from her, focus on something else, something like writing, writing isn't bad it really makes you feel free, here I could say what I want whenever I want to whoever I want, it's like being a badass without anyone judging you, well technically I also do that in real life, I guess I'm a badass, cool right? then it's settled. Quarantine isn't that bad, people have reconnected to each other through the world, now there's no poor or rich, everyone is living the same life having the same struggles, so for your expensive car, sorry you can't drive it anymore, your private jet you can't get your ass out for a jog so it's staying at the airport and nope no more fancy restaurants or hotels you ain't leaving your house, money doesn't buy you happiness at the end; I want to meet that genius who said that, he didn't live our time to feel that but he did felt it tho, how many millionaires are so lonely in their 30 bedroom mansion, so does he need them all? I don't think so, now a one-bedroom apartment with the one you love is more than enough, so cheer up people if you're lucky for being with your lover you gotta run for him and grab him till he's annoyed that should be a reminder of how much he means to you, I wish I had someone who I could say to when he asks what's the problem ""I love you forever that's the problem"" maybe coronavirus was made to show us what really matters in life, maybe it's the cure to humanity. For now, we should pray for the infected and for those who left us, we've lost so many and still counting. My god can't wait for the day we learn from the news that they did it, they found the cure, we could go out resume our lives with the lessons we've learned; the value of things have changed, we value love over anything because when everything fades love is the only thing by your side, do you know how I feel? I feel fucking terrible, I feel shit and all I can do is feel it, loneliness sucks but no worries, even the longest nights ends and the sun comes out, we just need to wait and one day everything will be okay, just patience my friends, but when that day comes we gotta have our life goals changed we have all the time needed to think about it, you need to ask these questions to yourself; right now, where do you want to be? with who? doing what? these questions if you have their answers then u can set your goals and u gotta achieve them, not for me or your mother or maybe father it's for yourself, think of the other version of you that you want to be right now, well there's no other version of you, it's you the only you and you can become like that with hard work and patience like I read once written on a wall ""fall down n times stand up n+1 times"" that's the life philosophy of successful people ain't no one born successful (maybe Kylie Jenner's son lmao) you got to earn ur success fight for it and wait for the day when it comes.

fs9adf,i_need_help_writing,[CW] A story I wrote based on Afternoons by Philip Larkin. The first few lines are adapted from an extract we had in class which we weren't told the author. Sorry for any grammar mistakes.,"The name on the driving license stuffed in her purse was Margaret Bell, “Margaret Bell’ was a nicely forgettable name. She was several degrees of separation away from her real name now, a name that no longer felt as if it had ever belonged to her. She liked slipping between identities, sliding through cracks constantly unseen. Her rented flat she lived in felt right, it wasn’t modern or expensive but the kind of apartment where a family would call their home. An ordinary family like Margaret’s. If anyone asked where they were she would just say “My husband has gone to the football and my daughter is at her friends. I’m loving the peace and quiet.”. Her empty wedding album was lying near the television. But no one new it was empty, just like they didn’t know the rest of the flat was empty.

The whistling wind battered the window, causing chaos on every washing line which littered the estate. However, the sun’s golden beams shone through the window and the distant playful screams children were now echoing down the streets. Just like every day at this time. The time Margaret felt her loneliness the most. It was the time young mothers would assemble at the swing and sandpit at the park ,setting their children free, no worries of what danger that may lurk. Margaret was always prepared for this time of day she quite enjoyed it. Right on cue she heard the familiar jingle of key and the shutting of a flat door. Another mother was getting ready to set free her child. Over the period of time Margaret had studied the little girl next door. She was bubbly character but not obnoxious, she had manners a delightful surprise in this modern day thought Margaret. But had her parents noticed how naive she was? 

Margaret finally rose from her chair, leaving her apartment to go for a walk. But to where? The sandpit and swings of course. She followed from a distant after all they would surely notice her presence if she was too close. It wouldn’t really matter though she had already fabricated a lie, she was just going to the park to read her book in nature. Anyone who was observant however, would of noticed that she had been reading the exact same book now for six months now. To be fully honest ‘Les Misérables’ was her favourite book, she remembered one her mum used to read this book to her in their Paris terrace. They had nearly arrived at the park the screams of the children were now mixed with the low chuckles of husbands standing detached from their wives, joking about work. The mothers stood in huddles discussing the best babysitters that freed them of their duties and allowed them to have their longed for break of freedom.

The little girl Margaret had followed was now mixed with the other children and her mother had joined the huddle. The little girl’s accent stuck out amongst the other children, it was clearly French. However, other the course of the six months she had watched the little girl it had become less clear. It had mixed with the local accent. Margaret took her place on the bench slowly pulling out her book from her pocket, turning to the familiar page, her favourite page. The scene where Jean Valjean had just rescued Cosette from Thenardier and Madame Thénardier. She slowly became entranced just listening to the sounds in the park admiring some before they were gone. The rustling leaves which had began to turn orange over the past days, a clear indication that summer was fading. She knew she was going to be disturbed, she always was. A little girl was now at Margaret’s side, the little girl with the French accent, the naive little girl. “Bonjour Madame,” sung the little girl. 

Margaret just smile down at the little girl but the smile soon faded. On the girl’s forehead was a small bruise. A bruise that wouldn’t be seen if your weren’t looking for it, a bruise that would usually go unnoticed. Silence fell over the small duo. “What do you want Cosette?” Margaret asked the little girl, masking any concern in her voice not to worry the child in front of her. 

But to be truthful Margaret didn’t need to ask, Cosette always wanted the same thing for Margaret to sing Castle on a cloud ,and would Margaret would do that everyday for little Cosette. 

But something was different today and couldn’t go unnoticed. The police were invading the park ever so slowly closing down like a pack of lions closing down on their prey. They hadn’t caught the attention of the assembled others or the detached husbands but they had caught the attention of Margaret. Her palms were now become sweaty and her voice was catching slightly in her throat. The police were now visible to everyone. A silence had fallen over the crowded park. Mothers rushed towards their children scooping them into the safety of their arms. Cosette however, was too entranced by the song. They were now only footsteps away and Margaret’s eyes were focused on the handcuffs which were now being tightly clenched by the the middle aged policemen.

Then Margaret felt a hand on her shoulder. They had finally found her after all this time. Margaret let out a sigh of relief. “Well done Agent 365. Now return little Cosette here to her parents. They are in the black car round the corner.” Came a rough voice. Margaret just nodded standing up and Cosette latched on to her hand making there way towards the park gate. Margaret took her final glance at Cosette’s ‘mother’ as she was being cuffed by a police officer, never to assemble again at the sandpit and swings.",3,1585643552,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fs9adf/cw_a_story_i_wrote_based_on_afternoons_by_philip/,WritingPrompts,1

fs3wg5,MrBadWolf_,[WP] Today is my brother in law's birthday. He asked me to write him a story as his present. So the prompt is: entertain a 36 year old man from New Jersey with a crazy story.,"In the coming years, modern medicine is set to advance so greatly that the first person to live to one thousand years old has already been born. The modern Methuselah was not the son of Enoch, but rather the son of a wealthy investor from Austin Texas. Chuck, born Chester Williamson, was born October 12th, 2018. He has spent the last 876 years as the world's oldest man. He has gained and lost fortunes a dozen times over, worked in every occupation from a first responder to a financial guru, and is revered by the public. He's been a psychologist and philosopher for centuries with dozens of published works on his theories about life. Today, he starts his bid as the Near-Anarchy Party candidate for Grand Chancellor of the Allied Earth Nations which span 86% of the inhabitable land left on Earth. Deeply influenced by his hero, Robert A Heinlein, his speech is read as follows:

My fellow earthlings, I come to you today as many things. Most importantly, I come to you as a caretaker. Through my millennium of life I have struggled, lost my way, lost my country, lost my family, and gained insight that my ancestors thought impossible. The wisdom I have been lucky to gain from a number of experiences that even I find incomprehensibly long is my greatest strength. It has been my life's work to improve the human disposition. With your help, I plan to lead our first sustained colony into the Andromeda Galaxy. Earth, its solar system, and many of the inhabitable planets we have found, terraformed, or inhabited will die before humanity. Our biggest hope is to travel toward the universe's edge. Andromeda is the next step. Join me in expanding intelligent life across all existence; beyond what we know. I am Chuck Williamson, and a vote for Chuck is a vote for humanity.

fs2134,mattnewlin54,[EU] The Northern Crown Chapter 1: The Valley,"An Army Special Forces Soldier fights for his life while evading capture by unnamed soldiers on an alien planet.

This is a weekly series, chapters posted every Monday afternoon (US Central). I hope you enjoy, critiques are welcome!

Chapter 1:

2811 Lima, 3 April 2024. Artemis, Rho Coronae Borealis System – 57 Lightyears from Earth.

Roiling clouds abutted against the mountains on the far side of the valley as thunder rumbled beyond. Three broad spikes crowned in snow glistening in the face of the setting sun. A plateau stood alone behind them, enduring the lightning and frozen rain. The western ridge had crumbled long ago, proud spires now frightening masses of black and white stone shrouded in evergreen trees. The river below flowed swiftly from north to south, bowing into a broad ‘S’ as it left the crater lake behind. The crater, a perfect circle among the jagged and cracked earth, stared up at the alien stars in the darkening sky – an impossibly blue eye peering into the deep.

The wind bit his lips and throat with every breath, the frost gathering in his beard and mustache. The sun was dipping below the western horizon, the sleet and freezing rain were turning into snow, and the whispering breeze was picking up into a howling gale. His legs were numb below the knees, his hands were like clubs, and his shoulders screamed with every jolt down the mountain pass. He paused, leaning up against a pine as he sucked on his camelback tube, listening. The pines shivered in the wind, the ferns rattled as they curled up for the night, and the birds held their silence as the Monster stalked his prey. His amber eyes scanned the trees and the valley below, the impact crater just a few miles from a continental divide. The deep blue lake stretched out below him, rimmed with black cliffs, the last remnants of an ancient asteroid. He couldn’t make the cabin before nightfall, and he wouldn’t dare travel at night. He drove on, faster this time, he needed to make the lake before night, or he might be stuck at high altitude for half of tomorrow; the blizzard was coming, and he couldn’t afford the lost time.

“Shit,” he gasped as he tripped and rolled down the rocky path, faceplanting into the roots of a tree.

He wiped the blood from his lip and pushed himself up and froze at the noise. A bird squawked and fluttered out of its nest a hundred meters away. He breathed low and scanned the area again. A flicker of movement caught his eye, and he dashed down the path again, running on peg-legs that were somehow coming back to life. He couldn’t let them catch him, he couldn’t let them find it, not yet, not until tomorrow at least. He tore off his pack and tossed it into the brush, sprinting now as the path leveled out to the lake. The cliff was there, this was his chance, his last chance to escape for a little while longer. Thundering, bounding footsteps accelerated down upon him as he threw himself off the ledge and into the dark water below. His diaphragm contracted violently as the freezing water drove his body into shock. He sunk into the depths, his jaw clenched and his mind wandered out of consciousness. He vaguely remembered being pulled from the water, being tossed up the cliff, and tied down. The rush of water forced from his lungs, and the warmth of the fire brought him back to life in an instant.

“Jordan,” Major Marshall ‘Guardian’ Allen greeted him with a beaming smile, “Long time.”

Marshall placed his hand over the canteen cup, taking comfort in the boiling instant chicken-noodle soup that constituted his measly dinner. Jordan Howard watched with rapped attention, his stomach growling all the while.

“When’s the last time you ate, Jay?” Marshall asked.

Howard hesitated; if he started talking, it would be difficult to stop, but he couldn’t remember the last time he’d eaten, and he was hungry now. “I don’t know.”

Marshall looked at him with scorn, “Packed a little light, did ya?”

Howard nodded, “In a hurry.” He paused, staring at the cup again, “Allen, please…”

“Don’t sweat it,” Marshall cut him off with a wave of the hand. “I’ll feed you,” he met Howard’s eye, “Just tell me why you did it.”

Howard felt the dryness in his throat as he tried to swallow, “The snow’s coming soon.”

“Where’d you intend to stay?” Marshall asked.

“In my tent.”

“Then I better make camp,” Marshall rose and dumped the contents of Howard’s pack on the ground. “Very light.”

Howard’s pack weighed less than thirty pounds with less than a liter’s worth of water in his camelback, and no food remaining. Ten pounds’ worth was the compact arctic tent he had stolen from the station.

Marshall wheeled on his prisoner, “What the hell were you thinking? Were you intent on dying out here?”

Howard smiled bitterly, “Would’ve kept things simple, wouldn’t it?”

Marshall’s face flushed with pain, “What happened to you, man?”

Howard’s smile twisted into a mangled, scornful glower, and he was silent.

The wind whistled through and curled the branches as the temperature dropped below zero, the sun creeping below the horizon. Marshall broke the tent kit into its individual pieces, laying them out on the ground, something called forth a nagging feeling from the back of his mind.

What am I missing? he thought, looking between Howard’s pack and the disassembled tent. “Where’s your sleeping bag, Jay?” Marshall asked.

He held his silence, staring at the cuffs and their interlinked chains, counting his pulse in his wrists.

Marshall knelt in front of him, inches from his nose he breathed, “Where did you plan on staying tonight?”

Howard shook his head pathetically, avoiding the eyes of his captor.

“Fine,” Marshall growled, and he shoved him down on the stretcher board.

“No!” Howard groaned, struggling against the straps on his chest and the final tie securing his head.

“We don’t have to do it this way,” Marshall pressed the towel down over his face and wrapped it with electrical tape.

Howard’s final plea was muffled as Marshall lowered his face under the waterfall flowing from the rocks. Howard thrashed futilely as Marshall counted down from thirty.

Marshall lifted the towel from his mouth and asked, “Where?”

“Is the sun down yet?” Howard asked.

Marshall cocked his head quizzically before realizing what he was asking, “Oh, I see.”

Howard sucked in air through his mouth, awaiting the next onslaught of water.

“Who are you meeting out here?” Marshall asked steam rolling out his nose as he peered down at his prisoner.

Howard failed to answer.

“You know we’re stuck here, right?”

Howard smiled.

Marshall shook his head in disgust and replaced the towel over Howard’s mouth. He donned his helmet and scanned across the lake to the base of the eastern ridge. He switched his view to thermal and saw the faintest hint of a plume emanating from deep within the trees. Home away from home.

Howard tried to blow the towel flap off his mouth, but Marshall held the man’s mouth shut.

He twitched his jaw, keying a button on the inside of his helmet – increasing the sound amplification of his helmet-mounted microphones. Marshall filtered out background sound with an adjustment on his armpad and listened. Behind the wind, the creaking of wood, and the rustling of leaves, he heard a sniffling. It was up the hill behind him, back the way they’d come. Marshall turned his head and scanned for thermal plumes – and saw one. He wrapped his armored fingers around Howard’s neck and squeezed like a vice.

“Expecting someone?” the Guardian growled, his eyes darting between trees as he continued scanning.

He loosened his grip, and Howard sputtered, “No.”

Marshall’s hand bit like a python as he leaned his weight and hate into him, “Try again.”

“Not yet,” Howard coughed, then sputtered as Marshall tightened down again.

“Keep quiet, or I’ll tear your head off,” the Guardian rumbled. Marshall released his grip and removed the towel. He pulled Howard, still wrapped up in the plastic stretcher, closer to the fire, and retrieved his rifle from his back. “If you want your friend to live, now’s the time to say so,” Marshall whispered.

“I don’t have any friends here,” Howard hissed, angry now.

Marshall hefted his rifle and acquired his target; the thermal plum shifted to his right, stepping down the path slowly and deliberately. His HUD displayed wind speed and direction, calculating the ballistics for him as the rangefinder mounted on the brow of his helmet ranged his target. Four-hundred meters and closing slowly. He adjusted the magnification on his Schmidt &amp; Bender scope from three to ten power, the white and grey thermal signature taking a vague shape. Marshall read the ballistic data on his HUD, holding up and to the right of his target to compensate for wind and bullet drop. He sucked in a breath and pushed it out slowly, he relaxed his shoulders as he tensed the sling under his left elbow. He finalized his point of aim as the wind died for a moment, pulling the slack of the match trigger to the breaking point, and squeezing through in one controlled motion.

Marshall’s Heckler &amp; Koch HK417A2 assault rifle bucked lightly in his massive arms. The rifle’s suppressed crack cut through the driving wind as it sent a 7.83×33mm Boat-Tailed Hollow-Point up the gently gaining slope and into the target four-hundred meters away. The pop of the round struck stone after passing through the lightweight creature. Marshall watched through his scope as the body dropped and twitched on the ground. He switched his view to visual spectrum light just as the white belly of the spotted ram upturned as it tumbled down the path for the last time.

Marshall sighed in relief, smiling at himself as he shook his head, “I guess it’s mutton for dinner.”

Howard ground his teeth, “You gave away our position.”

“The fire did that long ago,” Marshall rebutted, “Never would’ve been necessary had you not thrown yourself into the drink.”

Howard didn’t answer, and Marshall squatted down next to him. What’re you afraid of? Not me, evidently, too late for that. He scanned the valley with thermals again and stopped. No plumes, no targets, no sounds or signs of wildlife besides the one he’d just killed.

He hurried up the slope, cutting the path as he rushed to find his kill. The ram was there, breathing his last among a leafless thicket. He pulled the animal out by the horns and dropped it on the path. He knew little of the fauna of this planet, the station only a year old, and the permanent surface base was founded six months after that. But, a ram’s a ram. The horns were heavy curls, marred by decades of fighting and bounding up mountains, the fur was pale and blotchy, the teeth ringed and too many were broken. The old ram was frail, separated from his herd, and walking in open country with a blizzard on its way from the east. Marshall patted the beast’s shoulder, You’re alone in a place everything else knows to avoid.

He looked down the slope at his campsite, the faintest impression of smoke rising from the fire, Where were you running to, Jay? He decided to talk with his prisoner again.

“The thermal signature across the lake,” Marshall bent over the man, his red visor and white skull smiling down, “what is it?”

Howard sighed, “A cabin.”

“You built it?”

Howard kept silent.

Marshall cocked his head again, this time in confusion. Then who the fuck did? He looked across the water and deep into the trees. “It’s warm in there.”

Howard’s jaw twitched.

Marshall smiled as he lifted Howard’s rucksack, stuffing the prisoner’s supplies back into the pack. He secured the undersized rucksack to the outside of his own and grabbed the stretcher’s carrying handle.

“You’re gonna drag me there?” Howard whined.

“That’s right,” Marshall nodded as he started out to the north and around the lake.

Snow started to fall as the wind picked up, gusts upwards of fifty miles per hour that buffeted the armored commando and his cocooned prisoner. The thunder grew closer as towering black clouds crept up to the eastern edge of the valley. Marshall scanned the darkness as the sun disappeared, and the ice on the lake thickened.

“Why did you ask if the sun had gone down?” Marshall asked.

“I guess I wanted more time,” Howard replied.

“More time for what?” Marshall asked, lifting him over his shoulders and carrying him like a log as he waded through the partially frozen river.

“To be in control,” Howard replied with a smile.

Marshall dropped him on the far bank and closed his hand on Howard’s throat. “Try again.”

Howard coughed, “I was waiting.”

“You had a rendezvous?”

Howard nodded.

“In the cabin?” Marshall pointed.

Howard looked at him.

“Who’s waiting for you?” Marshall asked, remembering something.

Howard didn’t answer, which was fine because Marshall wasn’t listening.

Marshall’s eyes went wide for a moment as he remembered, “Your girlfriend.”

“Fuck off,” Howard spat.

“Latina, right?” Marshall grinned, kneeling on Howard’s chest. “Maria? No, that wasn’t it,” he was terrible with names, but he figured he’d find out soon enough.

The ice groaned with the shifting tides, the double moons pulling extra hard on the water-level below the cliffs. Marshall watched the rock as it seeped down into the water, perfect cuts in black stone driven deep into the furrows of Artemis. Beams of moonlight broke through the clouds and cast pale cones on the black glass. Marshall’s armor shifted its hue from green, brown, and black, to white with black stripes automatically. The sensors on his helmet telling the skin what tones were appropriate.

Considering his load, and the dead weight, the powered suit trudged along at a quick pace, all the while snow layered itself onto his helmet and shoulders. He circled around to the north, gaining altitude as they entered the trees, black and green spears against frost-bitten ferns and bushes curled and folded against the elements. He took cover in the washes, scaling the broad ridges swiftly and pausing to listen occasionally.

The cabin rested in a nook formed by a cleft in the rock, a cliff topped by an overhang rimmed with icicles, an open mouth hanging over the picturesque log cabin. Smoke billowed from the stone chimney and curled up into the pines, tiny windows flooded golden light onto the porch where a rocking chair sat tipping in the wind.

In the warm light spilling out into the woods beyond the cabin, the faintest hint of footprints could be seen in the snow. The trail led into the forest to the southeast.

“So,” Marshall turned to Howard. “What’d you tell her?”

“Fuck off,” Howard growled from under the ram’s carcass.

“Let me be clear with you, Howard,” Marshall leaned into his face, “If I have to kill this woman, I will lay her crushed, frozen body at your feet and force you to dig her grave with your bare hands.”

“If you kill her, I’ll gut you,” Howard stared up at the red visor, blinding hate in his eyes.

“We’ll see,” Marshall dropped his rucksack and crept forward.

The spindly shadows of the trees covered his advance as snow-flurries further impaired his vision. His visor filtered through multiple settings, overlaying IR and visible light with Thermal and UV, it finally settled on a Thermal-Visual overlay that cast the cabin in white and red gloss. The snow crunched under his feet, the pine branches swatted at his armor, and the wind howled louder and louder as he approached the lonely home. He placed an armored hand on the chimney, grey stone growing from the eastern end of the house, and stepped around to the back. The teeth of the overhang rattled in the wind as he stepped under them. The darkness behind the house was cold and empty, except for a stack of firewood leaning up against the sheltered cliff-face. He went to the stack – there had been a layer of ice over the tarp covering the wood, but it was broken and a new coat of frost was forming.

The back door stained a deep red, had no window or peephole. Marshall decided to knock, once, then twice, and he waited. Nothing answered. He tested the knob and found the door to be locked. He squared up to the door and kicked it down with one powerful step, flowing in to his left and opposite the fireplace. Snow and freezing wind drove in with him as he scanned the room, his gun-mounted light illuminating the shadows. Candles flickered and extinguished, the fire buffeted in the gale, and the room was silent. A light puffed back to life, and the gas stove resumed its burning – a metal teapot atop the grate. Marshall killed the burner and opened the teapot, lifting it to his visor to smell it. Nothing but steam emanated from the pot, but a mug on the counter held ground tea-leaves in a filter ready to brew.

Marshall looked out the front door in the direction of his prisoner, he wondered how much time he had before the girl froze to death.

“Stay here,” Marshall ordered as he dropped Howard, still cocooned, in front of the fireplace.

“No shit,” Howard scoffed.

Marshall headed out the back door, pressing the door closed and sealing it with duct tape. The trail was still there, shuffling steps through the rapidly thickening snow.

“Where the hell are you going?” Marshall asked the prints as he followed them, thunder rumbling to the south-east where the tracks led.

frt8rv,TenspeedGV,[OT] Spotlight: thelettre7,"##Writers Spotlight
***********

This week's spotlight writer is **thelettre7**

I mostly know of thelettre7 from their activity on Theme Thursday and our Discord, where they’re a regular participant in campfire. What I’ve read is quite good. 

What stands out most is their willingness to challenge themselves. I personally feel like trying new things and setting limits and goals is essential to growing as a writer and a person. Their writing has improved significantly over the past couple of years as a direct result of this drive, I think. Check out their stories and see what I mean.

u/thelettre7 does have a subreddit, r/Stories_For_Someone, but it appears somewhat neglected. Bug them about it!

Congratulations, thelettre7!

***********

Spotlight relies on your nominations. If you see a writer who has been around the sub for a while, who has at least six (or more!) high quality submissions, and who hasn't been given the Spotlight before, send us a modmail and let us know!

**********

Here are some of thelettre7’s most upvoted stories of all time:

[[WP] You and your best friend have known each other since you were little kids. Which shouldn't come as a surprise, since you both grew up in the same house and even slept in the same bedroom.

frj1d9,peterman22,How to write a good content. (For bloggers),"Content writing is a relatively new field, with its origins routed in the internet explosion of the 1990’s. Since then, the demand for quality content has grown, and continues to grow, exponentially. What this means is that the demand for effective writers has also increased. New content writers are coming online all the time, learning the trade – often from scratch.

As a new writer, it can be difficult knowing just how to put together the kind of quality output that will result in positive business outcomes for clients. But, just like any trade, there are basic tools that make the job easier.

Here is a list of 5 terrific tools that can help you write fantastic content.

1.Portent’s Content Idea Generator

Despite its name and its probable intent, I use this one for help in formulating good titles. This free, web-based tool allows you to input a few basic keywords and generate a title based on them. You can refresh as many times as you want to make new titles until you find one that works. Portent’s is fun and easy, and can come back with some humorous results.

2. OneTab

If you’ve ever researched for a blog article, you’ve probably found yourself in an awkward position. I’m sure you can imagine what I’m talking about. You’ll typically have about 300 browser tabs open at one time, having to sort through them to find what you’re looking for. Not only is this confusing, but it drags down your processing speed and makes your system sluggish. OneTab is a free extension for Google Chrome that has resolved this problem for me. OneTab consolidates all of your tabs into one convenient list of links. You can still access everything just as quickly, but with less mess and headache.

3.Hubspot Blog Topic Generator

Okay, if you’re working freelance, this one might not be for you. But if you have the support of an office or a cooperative client, you may be able to score access to their Hubspot software. Hubspot is a management tool for inbound marketing. But one useful side-function is this topic generator. It can help you select writing topics that are in demand right now. That takes the guess work out of what kind of content will sell.

4.Canva

While graphic design is not technically part of content writing, I have found myself in situations where an image was needed to effectively convey my content. Besides, research has shown that text without images is less effective at capturing the attention of readers. So, a tool with an easy learning curve, that can produce professional quality images, is perfect for a content writer. For this, there is Canva. Canva is easy to use, and for basic use, it is free.

5.memegenerator

Just as I explained in item 9, above, images are powerful. Memes are even more powerful. They are entertaining, they make people think, and they actually invoke emotion. The best part is that a meme image in your writing can be (and therefore will be) copied and shared on social media. There are several free meme generators online. I find the one at https://imgflip.com/memegenerator to be easy to use, but feel free to use whatever works for you.",1,1585537310,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/frj1d9/how_to_write_a_good_content_for_bloggers/,WritingPrompts,1

fr74i3,Cody_Fox23,[CW] Smash 'Em Up Sunday: Mad Lib,"#**Welcome back to Smash ‘Em Up Sunday!**

&amp;nbsp;


##Last Week

&amp;nbsp;

So many new faces! It was great getting so many stories in styles I’m not used to. Of course our returning members gave us some excellent pieces as as well.  Choosing is always difficult, but I went with three stories that really pulled me into their world with ease:

&amp;nbsp;

####Cody’s Choices:

&amp;nbsp;

* /u/E_For_Love - [Hal’s Hunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fn1woq/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_sense_of_place/flbgurq/)

* /u/nazna - [cyberpunk John Wick anime dorkstravaganza](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fn1woq/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_sense_of_place/flcdj0x/)

* /u/Mcdavies94 - [Athdar’s Assignment](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fj2kpa/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_ides_of_march/fko9hy0/)

&amp;nbsp;

##This Week’s Challenge

&amp;nbsp;

Since we had a bonus week I wanted to do something *experimental*.

This has been my 4th month of running SEUS and I’ve gotten to know some of the regulars pretty well. At least I’d like to think so. So I wanted to let them make the constraints this week… sort of. That is why today is called March Mad Lib. I reached out to 8 regular posters and asked for a different constraint. There was no overall theme to match, none of them knew what the others picked. It lead to some interesting constraints this week!

&amp;nbsp;


***It should be a fun challenge!***

&amp;nbsp;

fr66zi,Akimaru0105,[RF] Excerpt from My First Story,"I passed the entrance exam of  this prestigious school known throughout my country and now it's my first day. It's time for me to make friends but I know that it would be hard seeing as it is my first time going to a public school. 

My name is Alice, I am eleven years old, and I am already in high school. Now you maybe wondering who I am, I am just a random person in this crappy game of life.

As my first classes started, I was seated right next to Maryah and she started talking to me. At first I was startled but she reassured me to not be scared of her. Considering this was the time that I was still naive and innocent, I trusted her with my secrets. After a few weeks, she started not talking to me, and until I know it, the whole class hated me.

I had a hard time making friends and so my first year was hell. This was until I met a boy named Zairen. Him and I became friends because we battled in chess and ended up in a stalemate. A few weeks of hanging out talking about our Chinese ancestry and our hobbies, he suddenly stated with eyes locked with mine, ""Don't talk to me anymore"". I was disheartened and sadly nodded at the thought of losing another friend. It was quite strange for me since I usually fight back. Every single time I thought of talking to him once again, his eyes...

I can't get his eyes off my head...

Those sad, grainy, dull eyes locking me down...

They hurt...




After this ""friendship breakup"", I started to play in the football team. We were able to reach a mass amount of victories during exhibition games, and soon enough started to forget those eyes of his. 

In summer, I was training together with my team in order to play for ""Palarong Pambansa"", a game dedicated to represent our school in the local bracket. The thing is, I haven't eaten yesterday and decided to train the whole day today. I only drank juice and it took a toll on me today. My mind suddenly went blank as I was brought to the hospital.

As I passed out, I saw his face with those scary eyes once again. I started to wonder once more, who owns those eyes... I can't destroy the feeling that I have seen them somewhere else. One thing I knew was the moment I woke up, I was crying.",3,1585489997,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fr66zi/rf_excerpt_from_my_first_story/,WritingPrompts,1

**Prologue**

*Over the calms I could hear Topside instructing the other divers to come down and get me,*

*“How long has he been down here?”*

*“How long has he been missing?”*

*The other divers had told Topside that they had grabbed him. I tried to shout out but I couldn't even do that. After a few frantic minutes of communication between the diver and Topside, I noticed a shadow coming closer. It was moving towards me.*

*“Topside, I found him”, the other diver reached down and grabbed my harness to drag me back to our dive stage and as he pulled me I rolled over and got a brief glance of my surroundings. I had been lying amongst a pile of human bones.*

**Chapter One - The Water**

September 19, 1945 I don't remember getting in the water, why am I here? Callum woke up in shock. This was the fourth time this week. It had been almost ten years since he had retired from the Navy and the things he saw or did was not for the faint hearted. Serving as a Navy Seal for the US Military, Callum was praised for his work until that dreadful day, the day that changed everything. 

September 19, 1939 I remember being called up to the Captain's office, Topside was yelling but not in the usual manner. I could sense fear in his voice. A word that does not exist in the Military. Many of the men looked terrified, there was an upcoming threat. A threat like no before, a threat we all called Nazis.

Callum is got up from bed and headed towards the restroom. Despite being in the Navy, he always gets nervous when he is near water. He gets into the shower and turns the tap and the water hits him like a storm. October 11th, 1934 we were all on a ship, It was rough weather I heard the topside yelling again. This time my name I head towards the main office Topside welcomes me in. There is another man in the room, a man that looked oddly familiar. The man tells me to take a seat, and introduces himself as Franklin D. Roosevelt.",1,1585475671,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fr3ipg/water/,WritingPrompts,1

&amp;nbsp;

#Feedback Friday!


###How does it work? 

Submit one **or both** of the following in the comments on this post:

**Freewrite:**
Leave a story here in the comments. A story about what? Well, pretty much anything! But, each week, I’ll provide a single constraint based on style or genre. So long as your story fits, and follows the rules of WP, it’s allowed! You’re more likely to get readers on shorter stories, so keep that in mind when you submit your work. 

***Can you submit writing you've already written?*** You sure can! Just keep the theme in mind and all our handy rules. If you are posting an excerpt from another work, instead of a completed story, please detail so in the post.

**Feedback:**

Leave feedback for other stories! Make sure your feedback is clear, constructive, and useful. We have loads of great [Teaching Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/teaching) posts that feature critique skills and methods if you want to shore up your critiquing chops.

 &amp;nbsp;

###Okay, let’s get on with it already!


#####This week's theme: [**Minimal Narration**](https://media.giphy.com/media/26u4hHj87jMePiO3u/source.gif)


 &amp;nbsp;

Let's start with with a sentence so I can be super clear.

&gt; ""John, take Ollie for a walk !"" **John's mother called from the kitchen.** 
&gt; 
&gt; **John huffed and flopped on the grass.** ""But I don't wannnnnnaaaaa!""**, he said.** 

The unbolded is, obviously, dialogue. It's within quotes. It is words spoken. The bolded is **narration**. 


This is gonna be fun folks. Since last week was no dialogue, I thought ""Why not switch the flip?"" Wait... ""Flip the switch!"" So this week - the dialogue is to shine and you are to limit the amount of non-dialogue (narration) in your piece to the absolute barest of minimums. 

**What I'd like to see from stories:** This is *the* time to work on distinctive character voice. A unique voice, pacing, cadence, rhythm. This is a really tough challenge to nail but it can be done. My favourite example of this has always been *[Hills Like White Elephants by Ernest Hemingway](https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/765/HillsPDFText.pdf)*. There is narration in the piece, but a minimal amount and the strength of it relies on the dialogue presented. So play around with this theme friends, and see how unique, distinct, and clear you can make characters without the help of narration. And a reminder, again -  ***Aim for the absolute minimum amount of narration. Some may be needed, and that's fine, but try to keep it just to dialogue.***


*Keep in mind:* If you are writing a scene from a larger story (or and established universe), please provide a bit of context so readers know what critiques will be useful. Remember, shorter pieces (that fit in one Reddit comment) tend to be easier for readers to critique. You can definitely continue it in child comments, but keep length in mind. 

**For critiques:** First and foremost, look at what narration they do use and see if it really is necessary. Then, we're going to look at how effective the dialogue is. The easy parts: Is it distinct, do you know who is talking? How do you know who is talking? Then get into the tricky: Can you *feel* the emotion conveyed via word choice, phrasing, pacing? Or is it a line that requires a dialogue tag to create the effect? Are their multiple ways of interpreting the line? Does that work to enhance the effect? Or confuse it? This will be fun to crit this week, and I applaud both our critters and our writers for tackling this challenge. Dialogue is my jam, so I'm really looking forward to this weeks responses. 



Now... get [typing!](https://media.giphy.com/media/2zelCiUo5KJyN8MgMr/source.mp4)

 &amp;nbsp;

**Last Feedback Friday [[No Dialogue](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fm1g0n/cw_feedback_friday_no_dialogue/)]** 

Oh man. Every story got a crit last week. Every single one. And not just a few notes, I'm talking some serious, in-depth, and well-presented critiques and you lot are making me so damn happy! 

/u/blt_with_ranch hitting it out of the park with those well-presented crits that just make you wanna say ""Hallelujah"" [[crit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fm1g0n/cw_feedback_friday_no_dialogue/fl3c8uj/)]. 

 /u/breadyly chiming in to offer some of that poetry knowledge. I appreciate it so much as critiquing poetry effectively takes a serious knowledge of the form. [[crit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fm1g0n/cw_feedback_friday_no_dialogue/fl53v1r/)]. 

I can't go on without a callout to /u/susceptive. They dropped a tonne of knowledge on a bucket load of stories. I was particularly pleased with this [[crit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fm1g0n/cw_feedback_friday_no_dialogue/fl2k27z/)] that highlighted some wonderful places for improvement and presented it in a very approachable and conversational way. Making crits easy to take is an important skill. You can be right until the cow's come home, but delivering a crit scathingly makes it a hard pill to swallow. Well done /u/susceptive and keep [crittin' like it's hot!](https://media.giphy.com/media/8dmB4qPhZudOM/source.gif)

Lastly this is my first time on Reddit so please be gentle.

story time

Dragging her feet through the wet soil she looks at the small hut in front of her, the hut that had only a small window to let the light though was like an ancient relic of the time she thought to herself “Is this really the place that he calls home?"". Peering through the small window she can only see a small crackling fire illuminating the hut, the place was a mess, if it wasn’t for the fire someone could mistake it for an abandoned house, she was caught off-guard when a firm hand grabbed her shoulder ""how can i help you"" asked the man, turning to reveal her face to the man, the moonlight illuminating her beautiful face she couldn't even say a word before the man said "" Oh its you... Well come on in"".

When she entered the hut she stumbled on a broken wooden cup and almost fell to the floor, trying to keep her balance her hood fell to reveal her long curly hazel hair and her sparkling green eyes. The man cleaned a chair and indicated to her to sit, searching thought the pile of things that had accumulated over the years he found what he was looking for a cup that was not broken and a tea pot ""Tea?"" asked the man ""Yes that would be nice"" she replied to him. As the man poured tea into the cup he asked her ""So how did you find me?"" she took a long breath before replying ""Well it was a bit difficult, but you seem to forget that i can sense your energy even though you hide in this gods forsaken place, i was able to sense you. We are in grave danger."". ”Well, i figured that much about the danger"" replied the man "" but what exactly happen, did the Queen loose some pet or something?"". ""Don't Be so stupid and no she didn’t, I've had Intel tell me that the Brothers are out once more"" she took a sip of her tea after finishing her sentence. ""Wait did you say that the Brothers are out again? How is this possible, we sealed them all those years ago and hid them"" said the man with worry showing in his face."" YOU SEALED THEM"" shouting the man pointing his finger to her. ""Well sorry but i don’t know how they got out i just have the Intel that they are out, i came here to check if you still have the rune"" she said ""what,, this rock ?"" he brandished his necklace ""as you can see yes, i still have it. I told you before, we should have destroyed them then and not keep them, they are to dangerous to keep them, but you are to focused on knowledge to see that are dangerous if in they fall into the wrong hand, wrong hands like the Brothers."" ""i knew even then that they were dangerous but i thought that the seal would hold for long time, I still haven’t fully research their capabilities we have to find the rest and keep them safe from their hands. Will you help me?"" the man was looking thought the window into the starry night ""well i suppose i have to help you, but for the smartest out of all you seem a little stupid right now, lets only hope they don’t find them before we do.""",1,1585317648,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fpxeyy/trying_my_way_on_fantasy_books/,WritingPrompts,1

fpw908,Tf2Shpeeojhjlj,"[WP] A magic school where every student is the Chosen One of a different prophecy, each destined to save the world from a different ancient evil","It's run by Headmistress Sue, a gorgeous half-dragon half-goddess with near-omnipotent powers and color-changing eyes who is unconditionally admired and basically worshiped by everyone who has ever heard of her...  Except for the main character, who is kind of weirded out by everyone else spending every waking minute of their lives heaping praise upon her.

It's not uncommon for the ancient evil from someone's prophecy to show up at the school itself.  In that case, only students whose prophecies have yet to be fulfilled are allowed to take part in the battles; after all, they can't possibly die since they have to be alive to fulfill their prophecies.

Typically, Headmistress Sue will one-up the Chosen One of each prophecy by heroically sacrificing herself to weaken the ancient evil enough for the Chosen One to just have to land the final blow, before triumphantly rising from the dead a few hours later every time.

But of course nobody resents her for all the killstealing and attention-hogging she does, and instead admires her for being willing to sacrifice her life to protect her students (even though they all know she's not staying dead for long).  Nor do they even stop to think about all the horrifying problems that the outside muggle world is facing that she could totally do something about if she wanted to.

The main character stands out for having powers that are much, much weaker than that of the average Chosen One.  She instead has to rely on clever strategies to overcome much more powerful foes.  Most of the other students and teachers assume that she has some true potential that she will unlock in her hour of need and become far more powerful.  There is more to her powers than meets the eye, but she never gains any godlike superpowers like the other students.

She makes a few friends at the school, of course.  One is a boy whose prophecy says that he and a girl matching the main character's description are destined for each other.  Yet she's not romantically interested in him in the slightest.  He's a bit disappointed, but is still nice enough to respect her boundaries.

Her other friend is the typical bully character who always tries to mock and humiliate Sue's favorite students.  She is still petty and impulsive, like any magical school bully, and it's behavior that her friendship with the main character help her grow out of, but it turns out that she's mostly doing it to take out her aggression about her prophecy.  She's one of the few people who is jealous of Sue's power and fame, yet her prophecy states that she will eventually learn to admire Sue's perfection like everyone else.  She doesn't like the idea that the kind of person she is is destined to be proven to be wrong and bad.

After a while, the other students begin to treat the main character as though she were a bully, even though her only real ""sin"" is not spending every waking minute talking about Sue's perfect hair.  She concludes that something is up with the students and does some digging...  Only to discover the terrible truth.  Prophecies in this setting don't predict the world's destiny...  They control the world's destiny, up to and including altering people's thoughts and robbing them of their free will just so that they will go along with said destiny.

Long ago, Mary Sue created a prophecy that would constantly create more prophecies with their own Chosen Ones, as well as making circumstances conspire to resurrect all the ancient evils that they would face.  Sue is constantly empowering evil forces and threatening the world just so that she can look good when she saves it.  And the prophecy also ensures that everyone who meets her will love and admire her...  By altering their thoughts to make sure that they do.

The main character also learns the truth behind their powers.  She got them from one of the few prophecies not created by Mary Sue, by a wizard who was determined to end Sue's reign of terror.  She has the power to resist the influence of all other prophecies, including Sue's, and to break others free of that same influence.  With her and her friends free from Sue's mind control, they might finally stand a chance against her...  If she weren't still a demigoddess powerful enough to vaporize the entire galaxy with a snap of her fingers.  They must overcome this ominpotent foe and her army of mind-controlled students and professors with nothing but their significantly-weaker powers, their wits, and their determination.",3,1585312854,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fpw908/wp_a_magic_school_where_every_student_is_the/,WritingPrompts,1

fpo1dh,Cody_Fox23,[PI] A Traffic Jam and a Song,"“Stupid car!” I yelled, slamming my fist on the dashboard. “Don’t die on me now!”

&amp;nbsp;

It didn’t really matter. In the last hour I may’ve moved fifty feet. I-95 was a parking lot, and the July sun had turned it into an oven. Something overheated. No matter how often I turned the ignition it wasn’t going to start. 

&amp;nbsp;

That’s when I noticed it.

&amp;nbsp;

There was no sound on the interstate. I cracked my door open, and sure enough not a single car was running. Others were noticing and looking around. Suddenly all the radios came to life in every car. A few low piano chords before strings and electric guitar started running up some scales. It was happy on the surface, but melancholic at the same time in the undertones. 

&amp;nbsp;

“This hot humid hell,” a woman began singing as she opened her car door, “seems to n’er end. Held in place for hours with nowhere to go.” She was climbing on the hood of the sedan now as others stepped out onto the boiling tarmac. “Hot humid helllllll”

&amp;nbsp;

“Hot humid hell” more voices echoed it back as the song became more complex with percussion and winds being brought in.

&amp;nbsp;

Then the compulsion struck me.

&amp;nbsp;

I *had* to dance!

&amp;nbsp;

Out of my own car I grabbed a stranger’s hand and helped throw them up onto the hood of my Nissan. They in turn pulled me up, “Traffic Jaaaaaaam. Steaming on the road like clams we wait with naught a dram!” The words flowed out of my mouth as I stepped onto the roof.

&amp;nbsp;

The scene played out like every good Broadway musical number. When it came to an end and the song evaporated from the airwaves we all just looked around at each other. 

&amp;nbsp;

It was truly a Traffic *Jam*.

\* \* \*  
  

“Hyup! Move it! Come on!” My voice strained to be heard above the screaming winds as I tried in vain to hold the barn doors open. As horse after horse passed by me, terrified and seeking shelter, the door slammed into my body and I grimaced in pain. That was going to leave a large bruise tomorrow. I looked to the skies as I shoved the door back open again, aghast at the greenish-orange tint I saw there.

There hadn’t been a storm like this in ages. Magistrate Agea had warned us it was coming, and we’d done all we could to prepare, but would it be enough? I shook my head… there wasn’t time to second guess anymore. We would find out soon enough, one way or another. I glanced back into the stalls and ran a quick count in my head; it looked like two of our flock were still out in the weather, so Mereda was still out there.

My duty wasn’t done yet.

I planted my feet in the pounding rain and thickening mud, trying my best to ignore the cracks of bluish-white lightning that crackled overhead. Scary as the lightning was, it did illuminate three large forms heading in the direction of the enchanted barn. Three? I frowned. I must have miscounted. I concentrated, pulling what little essence I could muster into my hand and fashioned a ball of bright light along my right arm. I held it aloft, a guiding beacon in the darkness.

It worked. The three figures turned more in my direction and, soon enough, the stallion and another two mares thundered through the doorway. Mereda slid off the back of the stallion almost the moment she crossed the threshold and moved to help me close the door, her ashen hair coated with a mixture of blood, ice and moisture. If she noticed my look of concern, she ignored it.

The wind did its best to prevent us from shutting the door, but with both of our efforts, we managed to get the door pulled shut. I fell backwards onto the ground as the door slammed shut and grimaced. “Gods, I hope that holds.”

“It… it should.” Breathless, Mereda carefully dropped to one knee beside me. “We spent all week putting up wards and reinforcing the spellwood. I just hope the… town is alright.”

“Me too.” I touched her hand, my arm still lit up like a torch. “Are you ok? What happened?”

“I’ll live. Jasper threw me after a particularly nasty crack of thunder. I’ll heal once I get some mana back. I used most of it up getting us back here safely.”

“Understandably. I’m nearly out myself.” I smiled weakly. “But I can at least do this.” I pulled into my reserves and sent some healing waves into her hand. “It’s not much, but…”

She smiled warmly. “It still helps. Thank you. Come.” She stood and held out her hand. “Let’s check on the horses.”

I allowed her to help me up, the sound of the storm outside a cacophony of terror that thankfully was, so far, ineffective against the protective wards we’d placed on the barn. Our homestead was likely going to be levelled once it was all said and done, but we were much more concerned with our herd of horses than some easily-replaced odds and ends in the house… I blinked when I realized something was wrong.

“Um… Why is Angala not in her stall?” The mare was pacing outside her stall nervously, her tail expressing her displeasure at something quite visibly.

Mereda nodded. “Not sure. Let’s go see.” Her hand still in mine, we made our way down the stalls of the barn. The other horses were starting to settle in, now that the excitement of the storm was fading from their memory and they were warm, safe and resting at home. It mattered little to them what happened in the outside world, as long as the roof remained strong and stable.

Angala whickered as we approached, annoyed. She moved down a stall and I looked into hers with curiosity. “Well. That would explain it.”

Mereda raised an eyebrow. “What?”

“Come.” I opened the stall door and chuckled at the surprised reaction that crossed Mereda’s face. “Well, do you blame him? He was probably caught out in the same mess you were and just followed along.” I entered the stall and knelt down beside the creature that was at the far end of Angala’s stall.

The creature was the size of a horse, but the comparisons ended there. This creature was serpentine, with a large and toothsome head and tiny wings that were just beginning to grow from the center of its back. Its large, muscular legs were curled up underneath it and, though it looked at me warily, its expansive yellow eyes did not flash with anger or warning. It was simply too tired to resist anything I might do to it.

I knelt down beside the creature and carefully put my hand before its face, palm down. “Hello, little one. Did you come to escape the storm?”

“What is that, Iarn?” Mereda finally entered the stall and stood behind me, a careful distance away so as to not spook the creature. “I’ve never seen something like that before.”

“If I miss my guess,” I said as the creature picked up its head and sniffed my hand, “I’m thinking this might be a dragon.”

“A dragon.” I didn’t have to look at Mereda to hear the doubt in her voice. “Those things are huge. This is the size of a horse. Are you sure?”

“Pretty sure, yeah. But I don’t think it’s an adult.” I smiled as the creature, apparently satisfied that I meant it no harm, nuzzled up against my hand. “That’s right. We aren’t going to hurt you, little guy.” I carefully ran my hand down the creature’s head. It bore scales that weren’t immediately visible that were incredibly soft. “Look at the wings. I think this is a youngling.”

“Wonder when he came in.” Mereda knelt down before the dragon and held her hand out to the creature, letting it sniff her as well.

“He must have snuck in with one of the groups of horses. No matter. Storm’s only supposed to last two days, I’m sure we can just put Angala in one of the empty stalls toward the back for a couple of days.” I stood back up and stretched. “I’ll go move her. You want to get this guy comfy?”

“I can do that.” Mereda smiled at our new ward. “What do you think, little guy? Want to stay here a couple of days until this blows over?”

In response, the dragon nestled back down into the hay it was lying on and closed its eyes. It had obviously worn itself out getting to the barn. Mereda gently patted it on its muscular shoulder and stood up. “I’ll go see what meat we can share.”

“Sounds good. Couple of days, and he can go about his business.” As the storm raged overhead, we went about our way, making sure all the animals in the enchanted barn were safe, including our newly acquired dragonling. Little did we know that simple act of kindness would change our lives forever…

\* \* \*

“Oh dear.” I rubbed at my eyes wearily and sighed as I carefully stepped into the wan morning light. The storm had lasted longer than Magistrate Agea had expected, and had pounded against the enchanted barn for nearly four long days and nights. But finally, the sounds of the storm had subsided sometime in the night, and this was my first glimpse into the outside world since we’d holed up with the horses and our draconic ward.

As we’d expected, our house had not survived the storm. Where once our lovely little home had stood, waiting on the newlyweds to one day produce some younglings of their own to bring the pitter-patter of little feet and enhance the woodwork with memories and love… now only a stack of broken kindling remained, sticks of the foundation jutting up into the sky obscenely as a grim reminder of what might have happened if we’d taken shelter there and ignored the warnings from the town.

The house accompaniments were all gone, washed away by four days of pounding rain and gale-force winds. There would be no recovery effort, no rebuilding, no reminiscing of any sort – the storm had been overwhelming, but we had survived it, as had our horses and our livelihood, and we would carry on as we always had. A house could be built anew, a life could not. I smiled in the warm sunlight, the sound of dripping water the only reminder now that not hours ago it was pounding rain. “Think we should give the horses another day before we let em roam free?”

Behind me, Mereda approached and laced her hand into mine, her eyes lingering only momentarily on our destroyed home. “Probably best to give them a day more. There are likely pockets of deep water and rivers where there weren’t before, they won’t be moving on familiar territory.”

“Good point.” I turned and looked toward the end of the barn. “And our visitor?”

“Heh.” Mereda shook her head. “He can leave whenever he’s ready, but he looked awfully comfy the last time I looked in on him. He might be here for good.”

“Oh, I dunno if Angala is ready to give up her stall quite yet. She’s been fine with her temporary stall while the storm blows, but now that it’s over… yeah.” I chuckled. “We’d best see about getting out new friend out and about.”

“How do you suggest we go about doing that?” Mereda took her hand back out of mine and stretched. “Ugh. Sleeping on hay is all well and good, but my back’s killing me this morning.”

“Well, I do have one idea.”

\* \* \*

I looked down at the creature and smiled. I really couldn’t find any fault in our visitor’s demeanor. Though the horses had been quite nervous the first day, especially with the storm raging overhead, the dragonling had been on his best behavior the entire time and the horses had quickly grown used to his presence.

He rarely made any noise, beyond the occasional grumble or growl as he adjusted his position within his stall. Even when he ate, it wasn’t a savage destruction of his prey; the dragonling took his time with his meat, picking out his favorite sections first and setting them to the side for consumption after he’d finished the rest of his meal, which he ate with delicate bites.

Those favorite sections were what I was counting on now. I opened his stall and took one of the pieces from Mereda, placing it on the ground in front of me. “Ok, come on now, let’s go for a bit of a walk, my friend.”

He looked up at the smell of the meat and whuffed. The dragonling stood up and stretched, an impressive move that showed off the length of the creature. If I didn’t know any better, I’d swear he’d grown a few feet just in the four days he’d been sheltering from the storm. “That’s it. Come on, there’s more where that came from.”

He casually walked over and picked up the meat, chewing contentedly. I walked out of the stall, leaving it open, and took another piece from Mereda. “Here’s another one, big guy.” I placed it on the ground again.

He snuffed at the air and carefully walked out of the stall. He took the next piece of meat and chewed happily, then looked to me expectantly.

Mereda smiled. “It’s working!”

“Yup. Next piece?” Taking a few steps at a time, we gradually led the dragon all the way out of the barn until we were completely outside, where I put the rest of the meat into a small pile and stepped back to let the dragon eat its meal.

After it was finished, I sighed. “Gonna miss you, my friend. You’ve been…”

The dragonling ignored me and looked around, the last bit of meat still in its mouth. It snorted in disgust at the world around it and, its head held high, turned and walked right back past Mereda and I. It walked right back into the barn, turned back into its stall, and with a satisfied sound, collapsed in a heap in the center of the stall.

Mereda’s face cracked into an amused, wry grin. “Well, guess he told you, huh.”

I sighed. “Yeah. Guess it’s not going to be that easy, is it?”

“No. So… now what?”

“Now we let the horses run tomorrow… and try to figure out some other way to get him to leave, I suppose.”

“Good luck with that.”

\* \* \*

The sun was beating down as Mereda wiped at her brow. Rebuilding the farmhouse, even with magic, was taking its toll on us both, and it was well past time for the both of us to take a breather. She looked at me with those eyes that had enchanted me all those years ago with a smile and said, “Ready to take five, love?”

“Always, my dear, always.” I carefully set down the roof thatch I had been manipulating into place and cracked my wrist. “Augh, trying to hold that steady in this breeze is killing me!”

“Said he that pawned off the brick laying to his wife.” 

“You said you wanted to do it this time!”

“You still could have stopped me, dear.”

I snorted. “And listen to another six months of ‘you didn’t do it right this time, either?’ No thank you. I made the right decision.” Laughing, I moved away from the stacks of thatching and embraced her. “Besides, you do have the better touch for it, you know.”

“Of course I do. But if I can’t give you a hard time about it, who else can?” Mereda pecked me on the cheek. Before I could answer, a voice called out a greeting from outside the farmhouse. She raised an eyebrow. “Visitors?”

I shrugged. “Let’s go see.” Her hand in mine, we carefully picked our way through the now-half rebuilt farmhouse and stepped outside, where a smallish woman stood by a horse-drawn cart. The woman was quite elderly, bent almost in half from age and covered in all manner of colorful silks and garments that clashed garishly with the chosen color combinations. The areas of skin that weren’t covered with silk and cloth were bedecked with jewels and baubles, to the point she was nearly blinding in the afternoon sunlight.

I shielded my eyes and smiled warmly. “Ah, Magistrate Agea! You should have mentioned you were coming out, we’d have dressed up for the occasion!”

Mereda cocked her head to the side. “Or bathed within the last two days.”

“Or that, yeah.” 

“Pish!” Magistrate Agea’s voice was an interesting blend between the melodic tones from her youth and the shattered glass shards that a lifetime of channeling prophesy had wrecked on her vocal cords. “You’ve had things to do! I know that. Just wanted to stop by and see how the rebuilding is coming along.”

“It’s coming well.” Mereda moved to carefully embrace the elderly woman. “Your warnings were timely, as normal. We didn’t lose a single one of our herd, and everyone weathered the storm in the barn just fine. So thank you.”

I chuckled. “Yup. The entire herd, plus one.”

“You’re welcome.” Magistrate Agea glanced at me questioningly. “Plus one?”

“Yes. We, ah… picked up a bit of a stray while bringing in the rest of the herd from the fields. Didn’t notice until we’d gotten the barn doors closed, and neither Mereda nor I had it in our hearts to just kick him back into the storm. Now he’s gone and made himself quite comfortable, and though we’ve tried to get him to leave, he won’t.” I shrugged. “We’re both kind of at a loss as to what to do, to be honest. He’s been really good, though…”

“What kind of a stray?”

“Ah.” I grasped for words. “Perhaps it’d be better to just show you. Follow me.” I led the way to the barn as she toddled along behind Mereda and I. The doors were wide open; the horses were out in the fields for the day, and would return whenever they felt like returning. It took us a few minutes to walk the distance, for Magistrate Agea was not the fastest, but it felt good to take a break from repairing the homestead. 

Finally, we were at the barn and headed inside. Once we were at the stall, I glanced at Magistrate Agea. “Now, he hasn’t met you, but he was very calm with his meeting with both Mereda and myself, so he should be alright with meeting you as well. Just approach him slowly and hold your hand out to him, palm down, to let him get your scent.”

“Alright.” Magistrate Agea’s face was screwed up in curiosity. I could tell she was dying to know what was in the stall. So, without any reason to wait further, I opened the stall wide and held it open for her. Inside, the dragonling had been sunning itself in the afternoon sun, though it looked up as we entered, the new scent in the air already reaching its nostrils. It snuffed in greeting at Mereda and myself, its eyes drifting over to fixate on Magistrate Agea warily.

“Oh my.” Magistrate Agea made no move to enter the stall as she stared at the dragonling. “That is your ‘plus one?’ A rock dragon?”

“Is that what he is?” Mereda entered the stall and moved over to the dragonling. The creature leaned up to her and allowed her to scratch underneath its massive jowls. “We knew he was a dragon, just not what type. But yes, this is what came inside for shelter.”

“We’ve been feeding him meat scraps and the like. He’s very gentle, surprisingly.” I chuckled as the dragonling looked at me when I mentioned meat. “And a bit of a picky eater too.”

“You’re lucky he hasn’t destroyed the rest of your home.” The venom in Magistrate Agea’s words caught both Mereda and myself off-guard, and she waggled her finger angrily at both of us. “Mark my words, you two… get that beast out of here, or you’ll regret it!”

“Hey!” Mereda stood up angrily. “Now come on, he’s done nothing but be a total sweetheart the entire time he’s been here! That’s not fair!”

“She’s right.” I crossed my arms and frowned. “Even the horses have relaxed around him. He’s done nothing to harm anyone or anything. I think you could be…”

Magistrate Agea interrupted me with a snarl. “Fools. Rock dragons are horrible, dangerous, murderous creatures. Entire towns have been destroyed by rock dragons that went on rampages, and here you have one of their young just SUNBATHING in your stalls?!” She spun on her heel and screeched, “Imbeciles! The storm should have finished you off, it would have been kinder in the long run!” 

Mereda and I watched her leave with stunned expressions on both of our faces. Finally, I blinked and shook my head. “Well, that went well. Going to be interesting fielding questions next time we head to town for supplies.”

“Iarn, what do we do? What if she’s right, and Pip really is dangerous?” Mereda knelt down beside the dragonling and draped her arms around its head. It leaned up into the hug and grumbled deep within its throat, almost like a purr. 

I raised an eyebrow in amusement. “Pip?”

“Yeah, Pip. Like pipsqueak. When he’s feeding and he finds a piece he really likes, he makes this really high-pitched ‘pip’ noise.” Mereda’s eyes twinkled. “It seemed appropriate.”

“Alright, Pip it is.” I leaned up against the open stall door and shrugged. “As for what we do, what can we do? He’s done no harm to this point, and it’s not like we can move him if we tried. Sure, he’s got a decent appetite, but it’s nothing we can’t afford to fit in the budget. As long as things stay the way they are, I don’t see any reason to set Pip out on his heels any more than I’d see fit to kick any of the rest of the herd.”

“Good.” Mereda scratched underneath Pip’s chin again. “And that mean ol’ Magistrate doesn’t know what she’s talking about, does she? You’re not dangerous to us, are you?”

Pip, for his part, continued the low, contented grumbling as he basked in the combination of warm sunlight and attention he was getting. His eyes lowered to slits as he fell asleep from Mereda’s attentions, and we left him there in the sun to return to our task of rebuilding the farmhouse, the Magistrate’s visit still weighing heavy on our minds.

\* \* \*

I sighed as I carefully picked my way down the ravine. How in the world one of the horses managed to get itself down this steep incline was beyond me, but the hoof prints were there, plain as day in the fresh mud. Getting the horse out of this mess was going to take a good majority of what essence I had to spare for the day. 

At the bottom of the ravine, Eoi stood waiting for me, the mare flicking her tail with a nervousness that was odd for her situation. The chestnut mare didn’t appear to be in any distress, as she was standing in the open and away from any brambles, the stream or any dangers. Still, her tail continued to flash, so something was bothering her, so I made my way down as quickly and carefully as I could. As I approached, I could see that her nostrils were flared as well and she was breathing quite heavily… she was definitely spooked. 

“Easy, girl, easy…” I murmured low and steadily, pulling a bit of essence into my hands as I touched her side. She flinched once at my touch, but as I released the magic into her to calm her, she immediately began to relax. And it was then that I felt the other presence within her, another touch of magic that was holding her here against her will and was likely the source of her alarm.

I frowned. “I wouldn’t have thought you’d come down here like that on your own, Eoi.” I kept one hand on the mare and looked around. “Who’s there? I know someone is here. This is close-range magic.”

There was a low rumble from all around me, and a voice echoed inside my head. “Very astute of you, human.” To my utter amazement, one section of the cliff side seemed to shift as a massive draconic head opened its eyes and turned to gaze in my direction. I’d literally walked down part of the creature’s forehead to reach the horse and not realized it. 

The dragon took a few short breaths of air and licked at its maws. The voice in my head continued, “There is a scent on you I know very well, human. I believe you have something of mine, something I have been trying to find for months now. I will give you one singular chance to explain yourself before I cleave you in half. Do not lie to me.”

“Of course not.” I shook my head. “You obviously mean Pip.”

“Pip?”

“Yes, Pip. That’s what we call him, anyway. The dragonling that came to shelter during the storm a few months back. I’m assuming he is your nestling, then?”

“Indeed he is.” The dragon moved further away from the wall, revealing his full size. He was immense, and I realized now why Magistrate Agea had been terrified of the idea of a rock dragon being in our barn. This creature would not have fit inside three dozen sheds stacked end to end, and just oozed physical strength and magical power. If he decided to kill me, there would not be a single thing I could do to stop him. 

His coal-black scales shivered as he shook off the residual effects of the spell he’d used to cloak himself from me. “How did you capture him?”

“Capture him?” I shook my head. “I did nothing of the sort. My wife was out in the fields, gathering up the horses in the storm, and I was at the doors, making sure they stayed open so the horses could enter freely. Once they were all inside, I shut the doors against the storm. When I checked the stalls, your dragonling had snuck in with the horses and made himself home in one of the stalls, and I wasn’t about to just kick him back out into that storm. So we let him stay while the storm raged overhead.”

The dragon moved so it was less than a foot away from me. I could feel the heat from its breath wash over me as it said, “You did not notice my child sneaking past you? I am supposed to believe that?”

I stood my ground and shrugged. “Believe what you will. The storm was raging, the horses were flying past me at full gallop, and it was everything I could do just to keep the doors open. I wasn’t paying attention to what was running past me.” 

I motioned in the direction of the farmhouse. “How did he get all the way out here? I’m assuming wherever your nest is, it’s not close to here. You would have found us sooner otherwise.”

“That is correct.” The dragon turned and looked off to the distance. “My mate and I have our nest many days in that direction.”

I followed his gaze. “That’s the direction the storm approached from.”

“Correct. It hit my nest before it hit here.”

“Then how did he get all the way to my barn?”

“He likely swam some of it, then ran once he hit land.”

“Swam?” I had a bad feeling I knew the answer to this question. “Ah. Did the storm wipe out your nest?”

There was sadness to the dragon’s voice in my head. “We lost six of our clutch. We had thought we lost seven, until today. Today, I caught a scent on the wind I hadn’t smelled since the day of the storm. I was confident he was your prisoner though. That is why I held your horse here, to entrap you and find out what you knew, where my child was being held… before I killed you, if necessary.”

“Well, I hope you realize it’s not necessary.” I smiled, hoping it was covering my nervousness. “I can take you to the barn and show you. Might take me a few minutes to get the… horse…” I watched as the horse simply levitated out of the ravine before me. “Well. That’s helpful.”

“I do not like waiting, not after thinking all these months that my child is deceased.” The dragon turned and fixed me with a steady gaze. “Understand that I do not trust you, human. Now. Take me to your barn.”

\* \* \*

“You’re back early.” Mereda didn’t look up from where she was brushing the foal’s coat. The little one was prancing, impatient to be done with the grooming and be back about the business of being young and free. “Everything go well? Did you find Eoi?”

“You could say that.” I glanced around. “Pip still in his stall?”

“Of course. Just fed him, so he’s probably sound asleep, snoring.” She looked up and caught the look on my face. “Why? What’s wrong?”

“Oh, nothing. Just do me a favor and open his stall for me, will you?” I had left the barn door open, and I could feel the rock dragon’s eyes on me from where it sat a distance away. Mereda hadn’t seen it yet, but its eyes were on my every movement, and I was careful to not do anything that would seem out of place. I leaned up against one of the stalls across from Pip’s and waited. 

“Um… sure?” She stood up after giving one last good brushing to the foal’s coat. Mereda took three steps out of the foal’s stall and froze, the color draining from her face as she spotted our erstwhile visitor. “Um… Iarn?? Are you aware…”

“I am, yes. That is why I want you to open Pip’s stall, please.” I smiled. “Don’t worry, I’ll explain everything in a few minutes.”

“If you’re sure.”

“I am.”

“Alright.” Mereda nodded and relaxed slightly. She’d always been able to read me quite well, and if I wasn’t worried, then she wouldn’t worry. Much. She undid the latch on Pip’s stall and opened it. As expected, the dragonling was splayed out, catching every possible ray of sunshine he could get in his repose. He looked up as the door opened and chirped happily at Mereda and I by way of greeting.

I smiled. “Heyya Pip. Someone’s here to see you.”

Pip looked at me with those wide yellow eyes of his and blinked, once. He stood up, slowly, and stretched. His stretching was an impressive sight, as he always seemed to get every possible kink out of his body at one go. Finally, with another yawn, he chirped again and reluctantly stepped out of the stall and walked over to Mereda.

As he leaned up against her, she scratched the side of his head affectionately. “Not me, you lug.”

A chuckle filled our heads, then a voice. “M’quarth. So this is where you’ve been hiding.”

Pip’s head shot straight up, and he looked out the door of the barn with wide, excited eyes. He made the happiest noise I’d ever heard him make since he’d come to our home, then he moved faster than I’d ever seen him move as he sprinted out of the barn. Hay and mud went splattering in every direction as his claws dug in for traction, but there was no stopping the rock dragonling from leaving the barn.

Mereda and I walked out of the barn to a welcome sight. Pip was cooing and cavorting around the giant rock dragon, who kept bowing his head and murmuring in its own language to the child. It didn’t matter the size of the creature, it was obvious that they’d missed each other, and we stood well back, not wanting to interfere with the reunion.

Finally, after a time, Pip broke away from the large dragon and sauntered back over to us, a wide grin splayed across his face. He walked up to me and dropped his head to my feet, grumbling happily.  I knelt down and scratched beneath one of his ears, a spot I’d learned he rather enjoyed as I said, “As you can see, I hope, I spoke the truth.”

“I did not have to see. M’quarth told me everything, and I now know you spoke the truth.” The dragon turned toward me, this time with no malice in his eyes. “From the fleeing of the storm, to the sheltering in your barn, and how the both of you saved his life and kept him warm and fed. And loved.”

Pip cooed at my feet and I smiled. “He’s been wonderful. We haven’t had a single complaint about him at all. How could we not love him?”

“He also mentioned a visitor that wasn’t too happy to see him.”

“Ah. Yes. The Magistrate. Don’t mind her.” I shook my head. “It took some time, but the village has calmed down. Especially now. I’m assuming Pip will be returning home?”

“Yes. We will be making the trip home.” The dragon’s voice turned sad. “Whether M’quarth survives the trip will be another question.”

“Survives?” I glanced at Mereda. “What… what do you mean?”

“As I said earlier, some of the time my youngling spent after leaving the nest would have been spent swimming. There is not a landmass that connects the island my mate and I live on with your continent. So I’m afraid young M’quarth here is going to have to make that swim one more time.” The dragon looked off into the distance. “I will take him to where the distance is the smallest, and will accompany him as he swims, but I cannot aid him otherwise.”

“You can’t carry him?” Mereda knelt down and wrapped her arms around Pip’s neck. “Or swim for him and let him ride on your back?”

“I cannot. My claws would tear him apart. They are not designed for carrying. And… I cannot swim. No rock dragon can after a certain age. We are too dense, and sink.” The anguish in the dragon’s voice was palpable. “The most I can do is fly overhead, offer encouragement, and observe his progress. And if he perishes, at least I’ll be able to let my mate know that one of our brood nearly made it back.”

“Why would you have your nest on an island if you and your mate can’t swim?” 

The dragon turned back to me. “We have raised three generations on that island before this. No human ships have ever ventured near it. It’s been perfect prior to the storm. Once the young are old enough, they can easily fly to the main lands and they never have had to worry about swimming before.”

He looked down at Pip. “But this time, he will have to swim one more time to return home. Come, M’quarth. Say your farewell, and let’s be off. I thank you for your kindness, humans, but we must go.”

Pip rumbled and rubbed up against my leg, nearly bowling me over before he moved over to Mereda and repeated the process. Then, after one more yip in our direction, he bounded happily over to his father. 

As the dragons turned to go, Mereda turned to me, her eyes wet. “Iarn… he can’t…”

“I know.” I pulled her in close and gave her a kiss. “Will you be alright?”

“Of course, love. Just be careful.”

“Always.” I gave her a hug then, after releasing her, turned and walked toward the two dragons. Pip was the first to notice me following them, and he chirped happily and doubled back to walk alongside me.

The dragon turned and regarded me curiously. “What are you doing?”

“I’m going with you.”

“Why?”

“Why do you think?” I smiled and put my hand on Pip’s head as we walked. “I can’t just let this little guy drown. I’m going to help him get home.” I motioned to the dragon. “Though you might not be able to carry me in your claws, I can sit on shoulders there as long as I’m careful. From there, I should be able to provide assistance to Pip with my magic as needed.”

“You would do that?” There was more than a hint of doubt in the dragon’s voice. “What do you ask in return?”

“Just that you bring me back to the mainland afterward. I’ll make my way home after that.”

“Huh.” We walked in silence for a time, beyond Pip’s playful growling and muttering as we walked. “Humans are not quite what I expected.”

“I’m glad to hear that. How far until the swimming point?”

“At M’quarth’s walking pace – and yours – maybe a dozen days. I will bring food for my little one, will you need anything?”

“My magic will provide what I need.” I turned and waved at Mereda as myself and the two dragons started our journey. I did not know what would come next. But I knew I couldn’t just let Pip make that swim without me. 

I’d saved his life once. I sure as the seven hells wasn’t going to let him die again. I’d see him home, then return to my quiet life.

With encouragement from OP and a lot (like 4 or 5, it's a lot for me) readers, I polished it and submitted for publishing. It'll take 3 days before Amazon puts it in the store, but it's my first time doing it, so it's very exciting.

What's below is the rough, unedited, warts-and-all story I posted in that thread. Over the past 3 days, during intense isolation, I wrote about 45 pages and 18,000 words. It has been exhilarating expanding on this story.  

Anyways: here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm gonna kill that motherfucker,"" the beautiful princess announced in her royal suite.

""Dear, surely you don't mean th--"" her handmaid squeaked as she followed.

""No. I mean it. I'm gonna kill him. Right after I beat the living shit out of him,"" she interrupted, as she rummaged through a chest and retrieved a sword and several knives.

""Don't you think that's a rash decision? Shouldn't we at least try to resolve this civilly before resorting to such violence?"" The handmaid, the very picture of gentleness, rested a hand on the princess's shoulder.

The princess stood up and pursed her lips as if to think about it.

""Nope,"" she said finally, as she slipped the sword into her belt and strolled out of her room and into the corridor.

""Wait! My lady! What did he do to provoke you so?""

""Oh hohohoho! You wanna know what he did? That little prick? He fucked with Bessie."" She said it matter-of-factly as she lifted a crossbow from above a mantle and tested the tension.

""He... Who... Who is Bessie?""

""Bessie. My scaley sweetheart. The dragon in the old tower. You know. I spent a summer with her last year."" The princess was now walking toward the apothecary's office at the handmaid's running pace.

""Spent a summer? Princess, you were kidnapped! The entire kingdom was looking for you!""

""Kidnapped,"" the princess repeated. ""I don't know why people think that. I told them I wasn't. I wanted to see the dragon. And you know what? I did. And it was the tits. Bessie rules."" The princess turned her attention to the ancient man in the dark dank laboratory. ""I need poison. Now.""

""I'm sorry? Princess? What does a princess need with poison?"" The man groaned through his quivering lips.

""I need poison for killing dumb pieces of shit.""

""I--er...I don't know if I understand entirely... Surely you mean some kind of... a love potion perhaps... or, I don't know... A beauty elixir of s--""

""No. Killing potion. It's called poison. I need poison. Give me it.""

As the apothecary considered these complicate words, the king entered the office in a hurry. The handmaid fell to a knee, while the ancient apothecary bowed his head slightly.

""Your majesty,"" the old man said.

""Loren,"" the king replied, acknowledging him. ""Oh, and daughter. Good to see you.""

""Dad, Loren's not giving me what I asked for."" The princess said. The ancient man's eyes darted from the king to the princess and back again.

""Oh, um, Loren, why don't you do what she says. And while you're at it, do you have the... stuff we talked about?"" The king ended in low whisper.

""Your majesty, it could kill!"" Loren said in his feeble urgency.

""We talked about this. If it's still working after four hours, I'll call for you,"" the king said.

""No, the poison your daughter is asking for,"" Loren replied. The king looked at his daughter.

""Why do you need poison?"" He asked.

""I'm gonna fucking kill Erik,"" she responded.

The king looked at her up and down and noticed she was equipped with a sword and crossbow--his crossbow.

""When you're finished can you put that back where you found it?""

""Sure.""

""Do what she says, Loren. It'll make all of our lives a lot easier.""

""Yes sire,"" Loren answered.

""Give me the meanest one you got,"" the princess demanded. ""something to dip the arrows in before I shoot him through his dumb fucking face.""

Part II

The sun set on the prairie, making a silhouette out of the lone rider. As his horse trotted casually, he plucked at a lute, singing a song into the open, echoing bittersweet words of love lost into the universe. For even the angels wept at--

The lute crunched and twanged in a sudden discord and the man looked at the instrument. An arrow was lodged in its side. A cold shiver went down the man's neck and he looked onto the prairie for his assailant.

""There you are, you blonde-headed bitch!"" Shouted the woman galloping towards him.

The man fumbled for his sword, but it was tangled on the straps that held his shield and bow. His horse, confused, began turning in circles herself.

Another arrow flew toward him and missed his face by a hair.

""Stop moving and let me shoot you!"" The voice called, much closer now.

""Fair maiden, I know not what I have done to offend thee! Spare this adventurer's life in your womanly compassion!"" He called out in his melodious pitch.

""Ugh!"" The princess exerted an offended grunt. ""Womanly??"" She hopped down from her horse and walked toward the man, still twirling on his horse. ""Stopping moving Erik, I need to kill you."" She informed him.

The horse stopped moving and looked at the princess, and for the first time, so did Erik.

""Princess Delilah?""

""Erik.""

She shot a bolt toward his face, but he quickly shielded it with his hand. The tip went through his palm and stopped just short of his face. Erik released a howl equal parts shriek and sob.

""My love! Delilah, my sweet. How could thou have done this?"" He spoke through the wailing.

""Talk! Normal!"" She released another bolt, but it missed as Erik and his horse started moving erratically again.

""Please, your grace, please tell me how I have injured thee! I entreat ye!""

""You fucked with Bessie! You **know** not to fuck with Bessie. I should have killed you when we broke up.""

""Surely, you mean when I broke up with you, my grace?""

Another bolt flew into his thigh, sending him over the side of the horse.

""Princess! If you kill me now, how will you know where Bessie is?"" The man's eyes, wet and red with tears flashed a shade of cunning.

The princess was about to shoot him through his dumb fucking face, like she said she would, but he had a point. ""OK, tell me where Bessie is so I can shoot you.""

""You really cannot believe I am that foolish,"" Erik retorted.

""Erik. That amount of foolishness doesn't scratch the goddamn surface of what I believe about you.""

""Well... Nevertheless, you'll need to take me with thee if you hope to find Bessie. I can't just give thee all my secrets,"" he said.

She lowered the crossbow. He was right, but she didn't like it. She really wanted to kill him right here and now, but she supposed Bessie was worth waiting a day.

""Fine. Let's get you bandaged. Also, you'll need to take an antidote because the arrows were dipped in--Erik what THE FUCK?"" She shrieked that time. Above the widening circle of blood that surrounded the arrow lodged in Erik's thigh was a massive erection.

""Oh my,"" Erik said as he noticed. ""The heart desires what the heart desires I suppose."" He winked at Delilah.

Delilah pulled the vial of poison from her pocket. Dad's potion for his boners. Christ, Loren, you really need to retire.

""You'll be fine, it should only last four hours--"" she stopped, and it clicked. If she was using this potion, then tonight, her father would be using... ""Daddy,"" she said quietly.

""I do so love when you call me that, dear,"" Erik responded.

Delilah walked toward Erik. ""We need to go back to the castle,"" she said.

""But Bessie is in the other direction. And moving quickly more than likely. Those smugglers did not seem like the dilly-dallying type,"" Erik said casually.

Delilah kicked Erik in his balls. ""Why are you so fucking weird?!"" She screamed at him.

Part III

""Loren!"" The king's voice bellowed through keep's walls. ""Loren, what have you done to me?""

The old man's bedroom door flew open, waking the ancient apothecary from his sound sleep.

""What? Who? Why?"" Loren asked in a frantic confusion.

""You fool! What poison have you infected me with?"" The king demanded.

The old man rose from his bed and lit an oil lamp to examine the king. As the light illuminated the king's face, he saw it: supple, wet lips; a clear complexion; sharp cheek bones. As the king moved his head, his hair fanned and time seemed to slow; each strand of his elegant locks reflected golden in the lamp's light.

""You look quite striking, my king,"" Loren offered.

""And yet I am flaccid!"" The king flicked his crotch as if to demonstrate its uselessness.

""I see. I must have mixed your middle-aged-male-performance potion with the princess's beauty elixir..."" Loren sat in thought.

""I... I thought she wanted poison,"" the king said.

""Yes, but I thought it would be more prudent to give to a young beauty that which young women should want. Not poison. Poison is a man's potion."" Loren looked satisfied in his wisdom.

""Loren, she will kill you. And that's not a hyperbole. She will literally end your life,"" the king warned. ""But first we need to fix *this*,"" the king said, thrusting his pelvis in Loren's direction.

""It will take time, my Lord. The middle-aged-male-performance potion is a delicate solution,"" he said.

But Loooooooren.... I have company *noooooooow*,"" the king whined.

\---------------------------------------------------

Chains clinked and rattled on the long wooden wagon drawn by several horses and guarded by armed men on foot. The bed of the wagon held a large shape obscured by a ship's sail and secured with binds and thick chains.

A whistle in the distance drew the caravan commander's attention. He lifted a fist in the air, stopping all the guards in the troupe. A large man, adorned in furs and skins and weapons trotted up to the wagon.

""Good evening, my friends,"" the man uttered in a low baritone that shook the bones of all around him.

""And a good evening to you, Black Scourge. We have that which you have requested, if you have the gold to pay for it,"" the caravan commander said through his darkened, black hood.

The Black Scourge looked past the commander at the shape. ""I'll need to see the beast first,"" he said.

The troupe removed the ship's sail to reveal a large, scaled creature tightly secured to the wagon's bed. It's snout was fastened closed by several leather ties and belts. The Black Scourge reached to undo the binds.

""You should not!"" The commander said, stopping the Black Scourge's hands.

""You are afraid of a little fire,"" the Black Scourge asked mockingly.

""We, uhm... Yes, it breathes fire, but..."" The commander looked towards his troops, who were looking down at the ground and kicking dirt in embarrassment.

""Then what?"" The Black Scourge demanded.

""It speaks,"" the commander replied.

""And?""

""And she is *really* mean. She called Carl a, um...""

""She called me a dirty orphan with an ugly face! When I told I really was an orphan she asked me if it was because of my face! I told her that it was because my mother died from starvation after the war, and she that was good because at least my mom doesn't have to look at my face!"" Carl explained from a distance. the dragon chuckled through her snout.

The Black Scourge smiled. ""A clever little lady, I see. And this is the one the princess is so fond of then?""

The commander shrugged. ""I don't know. We pulled it from the tower where it had some coward captured. She was so busy making fun of him that she didn't see us coming.""

""I see."" The Black Scourge handed the commander a bag of gold. ""I'll take the dragon, the wagon, and the horses."" He looked to Bessie. ""You are either going to become *my* good friend, or my new mantelpiece. Either way, you will bring me a princess, and with her, a kingdom,"" the Black Scourge said.

Bessie growled and fire glowed through her nostrils. The Black Scourge covered her face with the cloth.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

The whining was rhythmic as the horse walked through the tall grass toward the castle.

""Ow. Ow. Ow."" Erik squeaked in tempo with the hoof beats.

""What is it now?"" Delilah asked.

""It's either my leg or my hand or my penis, which is getting really uncomfortable,"" he whined.

""I know you're only used to three minutes of excitement at a time, but you'll just have to get used to this for now,"" Delilah responded.

Erik frowned and turned his head away from her.

""You know,"" Erik said, ""ever since you met that dragon, you've been a real cunt.""

Delilah laughed. ""If you're trying to hurt my feelings you'll need to do a lot better than that,"" she said.

""Is there some word more offensive that I could use than cunt? You rotten quim, perhaps? you sterile shrew?"" Erik guessed.

""It's not the words, it's the person saying them. If Bessie told me she was disappointed in me, I'd hole up in my room for a month. But you? I just don't respect you, so your words mean nothing to me. Besides, you're dead anyway. I just don't care what comes out of your mouth anymore,"" she said.

""There was a time when you did,"" he said.

""There was a time when I shit my pants too, Erik. But now, like then, I've let go of the stupid shit.""

Erik was quiet for a time except for his whimpers of pain that Delilah tried to ignore. She listened to the wind blow through the trees and the birds sing in the sky. She listened to the bees buzz in the air and the thundering hooves that approached.

Wait.

In an instant a hoard of tribal scavengers surrounded Erik and Delilah with their spears drawn. One of them began to speak.

""Who dares trespass upon the sacred lands of--"" the chieftain looked at Erik and then at the considerable tent being pitched in Erik's pants. ""Oh jeez,"" he exclaimed under his breath.

Delilah followed the chieftain's eyes to Erik's crotch. ""Oh, yeah, we have a situation,"" she said. ""We really need to get this fixed quickly... so if we could juuuuuust..."" Delilah began slowly moving but the spears moved closer still.

""Not so fast, you rotten quim!"" The chieftain said.

""Ha!"" barked Erik.

""It hurts more coming from him,"" Delilah said to Erik.

Part IV

The King began the next day in a foul mood, but you wouldn't know it by looking at him. His skin radiated with a soft glow and his musk was like whiskey and tobacco and cedar wood. He glided through the keep with grace and poise, slowing the commute of ladies and gentlemen alike as they crossed his path.

""Good morning, my king,"" cooed a formerly anonymous servant girl, biting her lip as she watched the King pass.

The King grunted a greeting back and kept moving.

He finally made his way to the Great Hall, where he ate his breakfast each morning and read letters delivered the night before. Agatha, the morning servant woman arrived to take his order.

""Good morning, my King. What shall I prepare for you this morning?"" She asked, her voice slowing as she picked up his scent.

""Just a sweet bun today my dear,"" the King requested.

Agatha chortled and twirled her hair with one finger. ""Oh yeah?"" She asked.

""Yes. Now please,"" he said more firmly, the words spoken staccato through his smooth, manly lips.

She shook her head, ""yes, of course, right away, sir,"" Agatha said.

""Sire!"" Called a voice entering the Great Hall. Sir Edmund walked with purpose toward the King, grasping a rolled parchment in his fist. ""News from the valley!""

""Spill it, man!"" The King said.

Edmund sat a couple seats down from the King at the large table. ""The princess has been taken by the Scavengers of the Valley. Our lookouts spied Delilah and Erik in bonds being moved Southward. Your skin looks amazing."" Edmund said with no shift in tone.

""What! Rally the Raiders! A contingent must be arranged to save Delilah from their grasp!"" The King shouted.

Agatha returned with a sweet bun and several of her blouse buttons unbuttoned, revealing substantial cleavage. ""Your buns, my lov--King,"" she said.

""Thank you, that will be all Agatha,"" the King said.

""Say my name again,"" she whispered.

""What?""

Agatha rushed away, breathing heavily.

""I have gathered fifty of our best men to combat the Savages! Your scent is alluring! They stand at the ready waiting on your command!"" Edmund was now only one seat away from the King.

""Wait no longer! Dispatch them at once!"" The King shouted.

""Your word is my command! You are so tall and I need your rough hands to touch mine! Your daughter will be rescued at once!"" Edmund announced.

""See to it, Sir Edmund, and... thank you, I suppose....""

The King jerked his hand back as Edmund's crept in contact with his. ""Go now please,"" the King said.

Agatha returned, her skirt hiked up. ""You haven't touched the bun at all, my Lord,"" Agatha said, running her finger along the pastry's contour.

""I've lost my appetite, Agatha. Please take it back.""

""I could... Fill it with cream for you....""

""LOREN!"" The King shouted as he left the Great Hall. ""FIX ME!""

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Night fell and Delilah and Erik found themselves bound and at opposite sides of a large stake in the ground.

""This doesn't look good, your grace,"" Erik said.

""Really? What was your first clue?"" Scoffed Delilah.

Erik released an exasperated sigh and shut his mouth, which brought at least some satisfaction to the princess.

The chieftain, adorned in ceremonial paint and little else, approached Erik, nudging the erection with his foot.

""Your stamina is legendary,"" the chieftain said.

""Please! Don't touch it! It is so sore,"" Erik whined.

The chieftain withdrew a large knife, to Erik's horror, but used it lift Erik's chin instead of cutting his dick off with it.

""You must tell me your secret,"" the chieftain said.

""My secret?""

""The secret of your large, ever-lasting penis,"" the painted man said, solemnly.

""Ha!"" Barked Delilah.

""My secret? Yes, my secret, of course! Uhm..."" Erik thought frantically. ""You must eat the heart of a... dragon! Yes, a dragon! And only then will you be blessed with a girth like mine.""

The chieftain thought for a moment. ""If the dragon's heart pumps through your veins, then perhaps your heart will still offer magic to make me... *sexual*,"" the chieftain said in the most unsettling voice imaginable.

The painted man then barked something in another language and guards retrieved Erik from the stake. ""We will sacrfice you to the gods and eat your dragon heart!""

""No! No, please! Spare me!"" Erik cried.

""Stop! Don't do it!"" Delilah shouted from her spot. The guards and the chieftain stopped and Erik smiled with relief.

""Turn me around so I can watch him die too!"" Delilah said. Erik's smiled turned quickly to a frown. The chieftain and the guards looked to each other and shrugged before proceeding to gently move Delilah to watch the festivities.

Part V

The old Stocks at the seaside were home to the most treacherous pirates and murderers and marauders the land had ever seen. The Black Scourge rode his wagon and horses to the decrepit moat that divided the stagnant sea water from the condemned keep. From a pocket in his fur coat, he pulled a conch shell and blew into it, reverberating a low trumpet sound toward the blackened battlements.

A drawbridge lowered with the squeal and moan of ship chains and rusty gears, lurching and groaning all the way down. The Black Scourge, his horses, his wagon, and his dragon crossed the rotting wooden bridge and entered the keep.

The cloth came off of Bessie's face and she found herself in a giant birdcage and the Black Scourge standing over her with a slight grin on her face.

""Good morning, my beauty,"" the Black Scourge said to her.

Smoke wisped from her nostrils as she glared at him. But with her snout still bound shut, she couldn't say what she wanted to.

""Now, I'm going to make you a deal. I will remove the bindings from your mouth. But if you burn me to death, my men here,"" he pointed to two wickedly overweight guards in poorly-fitted armor and small swords, ""will drop that,"" he pointed to a heavy spiked chandelier on the cage's ceiling, ""on to you,"" he warned.

Bessie looked around herself and took in the situation. She was never one to overextend herself, and one should play with the card's she's dealt.

""Do we have a deal?"" He asked.

Bessie nodded slightly. The Black Scourge reached in and removed the fasteners and belts that wrapped her snout.

""Does that feel better?"" He asked.

Bessie took a deep breath in and The Black Scourge and his men recoiled, but she only exhaled and answered, ""yes. Thank you.""

The men and the Black Scourge gasped in amazement. ""A talking dragon. I'll be damned.""

""You gonna be my dinner is whatchu gonna be keepin me in this raggedy-ass cage with not even a *bathroom* to do my *business,* with your caveman-looking ass, trying to be the king, like **that's** never been done before,"" Bessie spat at the Black Scourge.

""Cave man?"" The Black Scourge asked, offended.

""*Cave. Man.* Man who lives in a cave. Man who drives a big wagon to compensate for your--""

""That's enough. Your hurtful language is going to get you into trouble,"" the Black Scourge said, his voice cracking slightly. He left the room, followed by his two guards, one of them comforting the Black Scourge.

""She's so *mean*.""

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drums pounded as the ceremony began. Erik was tied to a new stake, feet lifted off the ground and his mouth gagged while tribal Savages danced around him. At some point, somehow, Delilah was set loose, and she danced along with the natives and ate turkey legs and laughed with the tribal elders.

Erik mumbled from the alter to Delilah.

""What was that?"" Delilah mocked him.

He mumbled urgently, his eyes darting to the ropes that bound him to the stake.

""Is something wrong?"" Delilah asked.

Erik mumbled louder, a scream through the cloth in his mouth.

""Hey Erik,"" Delilah said, soliciting the attention she knew she already had. ""Remember on my birthday a couple years ago? Remember when you fucked Gwenevere? Remember how she's my cousin?""

Erik's shoulders slumped.

""Yeah, haha, that's what I thought. Hey, you have a good human sacrifice now, okay?"" She shook a turkey leg in his direction.

She moseyed her way to one of the tribal elders who was drinking meade and seemed like just a genuinely chill guy.

""Hey, man,"" Delilah started. ""Do you think we can wrap this up? I have to get to my dad, who's probably really sick right now, and then I have to rescue my friend from bandits, so, you know, it's just this whole clusterfuck right now, haha,"" she said.

The old chieftain finished the swig from his cup and nodded his head vigorously. He made a loud pronouncement to the rest of the tribal hunters, who were all very excited to be receiving large penis power from Erik.

In the middle of the chieftain's speech, his voice was cut short. Delilah was standing beside him and felt a moisture on her face. It was the old man's blood, projected onto her from a bolt through his neck. The crowd of men gasped.

""What?"" Delilah said to herself.

Suddenly, a rain of bolts fell onto the crowd, dropping the tribes warriors like flies, but somehow, because the world is an unfair place where justice only happens in fairy tales, Erik was not harmed.

A regiment of the King's Army flooded the site, trampling the survivors of the ranged assault and dispatching the unharmed with haste.

""Princess!"" Sir Edmund called from his steed. ""Your handsome father of great renown and most probably prime reproductive qualities has sent me here to rescue you!""

""What??"" Delilah asked.

Soldiers unbound a sobbing Erik and laid him gently on the ground.

""Is my father alright? Is he alive?"" Delilah asked.

""And how!"" Sir Edmund announced without missing a beat.

Delilah sighed in relief. ""Great. Perfect. Tell him I love him and I'll be back home later. I have to save Bessie and I have to take dingus over there with me.""

""Princess, I must insist that you come with us. Your father gave us explicit instructions to retrieve you, and disappointing the two-hundred and thirty pounds of raw sex appeal that is the King of the union would break my heart,"" Edmund said.

""I don't know about *that*.... But I'm the princess, so, you know... Fuck off or something, Edmund. I have a dragon to rescue.""

Edmund drew his sword and pointed it at the princess. ""I cannot look your father in his glacier-frost-blue eyes and speak such words into his perfectly symmetrical ears, your grace. You're coming with me.""

Part VI

Bessie was finally freed from the bonds that paralyzed the rest of her body and she stretched out--as much as you can in a glorified bird cage--and returned feeling to her arms and legs. It had been a couple hours since anyone had come in or out of the chamber, and she was beginning to get stir crazy.

The other side of the chamber held a pile of rusted metal rods, and she figured if she could get one, she might be able to pick the lock of the great cage. What had she to lose?

Her arms were far too short, but her tail was long enough that it could just barely touch the surface of the pile of rods. She arched her neck backwards to try and aim her clumsy backside, but it was *just* out of reach. In a fit of frustration, she walloped her tail on the ground, knocking over the pile of rods and sending them rolling around the room.

The commotion caused a clatter that echoed about the room and was almost certainly heard by the guards outside. She retracted her tail back into the cage and lied down, as if she weren't trying to escape.

The door to the room opened, filling the dark space with a haze of orange lantern light.

""Are you ready to be nice?"" A deep voice asked as he moved closer to the cage.

""The Black Scourge,"" Bessie said. ""Why do they call you that?""

The Black Scourge set his lantern on a table at the far side of the room and took a seat. ""I am the terror of the seas; the scourge of the countryside. I bring with me judgement and pain and leave devastation in my path!"" He laughed a sinister chuckle as he recalled his great many crusades against the innocent villages and fishing vessels he had ravaged over the years.

""Okay,"" Bessie said. ""That explains one part--the Scourge, or whatever--but, uh... you are most definitely a white guy.""

The Black scourge stopped laughing and looked at the skin on his arms. ""White? I don't know about... white... maybe... I don't know... apricot, or something. But I get sun here and there."" He said in a thoughtful tone.

""So why not the Apricot Scourge?"" Asked Bessie.

""Agh! It doesn't have the same ring to it. That sounds like I make smoothies or something,"" he replied.

""So what does the black mean. Because it sounds a *little bit* racist.""

""Whoa! Hey! I am *not* a racist, dragon! We are an equal opportunity outfit of crime around here, and I do not appreciate that--""

""Hey, okay, simmer down there White Chocolate, I'm just making an observation."" Bessie said, trying to calm the Black Scourge.

""White Chocolate?"" He asked, confused.

""Don't hurt yourself there, honey, it's just my name for you,"" Bessie reassured him.

The Black Scourge moved around the room in thought. ""So word is you know Princess Delilah.""

""Mmm mmm, don't even think about that, sugar. She is *not* your type at all. She prefers men who *bathe themselves* if you know what I'm saying, okay?""

""I.... Bathe!"" White Chocolate said indignantly.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

The medic returned to Sir Edmund, a puzzled look on his face.

""I'm afraid it's not looking good, sir,"" the medic said.

""What's his condition?'"" Edmund replied.

""Well, the wounds in his hand and thigh are mostly superficial, mere flesh wounds. The bandages applied previously have been changed out for clean ones, and they don't appear to be infected.""

""Okay, so tell me the bad news.""

""Well... You know, it's very strange, and I'm not sure how to articulate it...""

""Don't just keep it in your mouth, man!"" Edmund said.

""No, haha, I certainly won't be doing that! It's, uhm, it's his erection. It doesn't seem to be going away. He said it's lasted nearly an entire day now, since Princess Delilah shot him,"" the medic answered.

""And nowhere to put it..."" Edmund pondered.

""Ah. Well... I suppose there's that.""

""Quite the medical conundrum, there doctor. But it seems like the opposite of a problem to me. We should all be so lucky! If only the king could see my permanent erection."" Edmund trailed off.

""What?"" The medic said.

""What?"" Edmund said.

""What the fuck?"" Delilah said.

""Delilah, where did you come from?"" Edmund asked.

""Are you trying to bone my dad, Edmund?"" Delilah demanded.

""Excuse ME, princess, but that is no way to speak to a man of nobility!"" Edmund barked back.

""Hey, man, you need to know that my dad doesn't play for that team. I mean, you do you, you know--there's no judgement from over here, my guy--but I'm *pretty* sure, with me existing and all, that my dad's preference is... not like you,"" Delilah explained.

""Sir Esper!"" Called Edmund, ""Please place a gag on Princess Delilah for the remainder of our journey!""

A burly man came from behind Delilah and wrapped a cloth through her mouth.

""Hrr, wrrrt thr frrrck!"" Delilah protested.

Erik approached the now gagged and bound Delilah.

""Doesn't feel so good, does it?"" Erik asked. He bent down and put his arms around her sides, under her coat. If looks could kill, Delilah's lazer eyes of death would have burned holes through Erik.

He removed his hands and the vial of middle-aged-male-enhancement potion with them. He winked at Delilah as he walked toward Edmund.

""Edmund, my good sir, I owe you a ransom of thanks for that gallant rescue!"" He dabbed potion onto something in his hand and touched Edmund's neck. Edmund recoiled and looked around. Erik pretended to swat at a bee. ""It looks as if you were stung by an insect, my good fellow!""

Part VII

The regiment sent to rescue Delilah, led by Sir Edmund, had long left the field where they massacred the tribal warrior savages. In Edmund's haste to return to the King and impress his majesty, Sir Edmund failed to follow proper kingdom massacre protocol.

Kingdom Massacre Regulation, section four, subparagraph 2.5 states that ""following the successful completion of any massacre, a regiment commander must ensure all members of the opposing party are definitively dispatched by burning all corpses not more than one day post-massacre.

The field had been left strewn with bodies, and one began to move. The painted chieftain crawled out from under the unlit sacrificial pyre and surveyed the land with a vengeful scowl. He snapped off the end of the arrow, still extruding from his neck, as he began to walk.

\------------------------------------------------------------------

""...and that's when I flew from out of nowhere and exploded the whole caravan full of gold!""

The two overweight guards listened intently to the story, offering audible gasps and fascinated *oohs*.

""Question!"" One of the guards raised his hand.

""Go ahead, baby,"" the dragon said.

""Could they not have built some kind of apparatus specifically to fight you with, if they knew you existed?"" The guard's surprisingly child-like voice asked.

""Please, sugar. There ain't no crossbow strong enough to clip these wings! That would make the story wildly inconsistent and indicative of lazy writing,"" the dragon explained.

Two guards agreed among each other.

""You have stories for days, don't you dragon?"" The Black Scourge spoke from a far corner of the room where he sharpened his blade.

Bessie looked out from her cage and in his direction, where only his faint shadow showed. ""Is that a problem, Coco?""

""The only problem,"" the Black scourge said as he rose from his seat, ""is that I don't believe a word of it.""

""I don't need some *man* to validate my story, little boy. I'm a real bitch, I know what I'm about. Besides, it ain't like you left me a whole lot else to do in this nasty cage,"" Bessie responded.

The Black Scourge snapped his fingers and pointed to the chamber's exit, where the two guards scrambled toward. As soon as they were gone with the door shut behind them, the Black Scourge leaned in.

""There is one story you have yet to tell,"" he said in a low whisper. ""How did you capture the princess from her castle?""

""Capture? Who? Delilah?"" The dragon laughed. ""Look, I ain't capture no princesses in my time. Delilah's my girl, she come visits me from time to time--spent a whole summer at my pad last year. It was the tits, sugar.""

""So the stories are true, then,"" the Black Scourge mumbled to himself. ""Then tell me, how does a beast of such destruction and violence befriend a delicate flower such as Princess Delilah?""

Bessie threw her head back laughing at the though. ""Delilah ain't no **flower**! Boy, she would cut you for even saying that. Delilah and I get along so good because we don't live up to the stereotypes people like you wanna say about us. Delilah's a stone cold killer. She don't give a fuck,"" the dragon said.

""Based on your many tales of conquest, you seem to have lived up to your reputation, dragon.""

Bessie shrugged. ""Hey, man, flies gotta fly, dragon's gotta to dragon. You can't fight nature. But I'm not one-di-men-sion-al neither,"" she explained, articulating each syllable in the word. ""I'm a kind soul, sweetie. I like you little flesh popsicles, walkin' around, doing business, filing taxes, or whatever. People are adorable.""

The Black Scourge sat close to the cage, thinking.

""Something on your mind, sugar?"" Bessie asked.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The medic examined Sir Edmund's condition, which had become severe in the last few hours.

""How could this have happened, doctor?"" Edmund asked.

""Oh, well, there are a variety of ways, Sir Edmund. When a boy, such as yourself, goes through big changes, the body starts to do **straaaaaange** things.""

""I understand how pubert--""

""And sometimes, in the wee hours of a morning horseback riding session, when the body is still partly asleep, the gentle stimulation can--""

""It's been like this all night, doctor!""

""Oh. Well that is a curious thing. Seems very much like the same condition Sir Erik was suffering from only recently.

Edmund remembered meeting with Sir Erik shortly after restraining Delilah. He had put his hand on the back of Edmund's neck, precisely where the bug had stung him. IT all clicked together at once.

""Stay back, doctor, I do not want to arouse you!"" Edmund leapt away from the medic.

""Oh you shouldn't worry about that, Sir Edmund,"" the doctor, somewhat confused, reassured him.

""I was in contact with Erik yesterday, and now *this*. Clearly his condition is contagious... I must have an audience with the King at once!""

A soldier entered the medic's tent. ""Sir! It's the princess! She-- Oh, jeez,"" he said, noticing Edmund's condition.

""What is it man?! Speak!"" Edmund turned to face the soldier and the soldier instinctively flinched away from the erection.

""Right. It's the princess. She's missing. We found Sir Erik tied up where we had her restrained.""

Edmund picked up a medical tool from a nearby table and threw it to the ground. ""Blast! This is like last Summer all over again!""

""Haha, yeah, a little bit, huh?"" The soldier said.

""Get our best trackers on her trail at once! I will not meet the King's salt-and-pepper stubbled, marble-cut face without his wretched daughter in tow!""

""Yes sir!"" The soldier said, saluting Sir Edmund and leaving the tent.

The medic squinted at Edmund. ""There's something seriously wrong with you, Sir Edmund,"" the medic said.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

""It's getting worse, Loren,"" the King said, peering out of a crack in the apothecary's office door.

""What is getting worse, you majesty?"" Loren asked.

""This!"" The King said, turning to face the ancient man. The King's shirt was stretched over his chest, where his bursting pectorals were pulling the seams apart. His skin glistened with a sheen of sweet-smelling sweat, and his chest hair was curled and moist with ravenous desire. The hair atop his head wafted in the breeze, adding an excitedly dangerous element to his desirability.

""WHERE IS THE WIND COMING FROM?"" The King shouted, searching the room for an open window.

""I must not look upon you, my liege, lest I become seduced by the potion's effects,"" Loren said, his back to the King.

The King slumped down in a seat and hunched his shoulders. ""and my Delilah is out there, all alone..."" He lamented. ""Ruining our relations with the Tribes of the Valley. And there's nothing I can do.""

A broom stretched from across the room and sympathetically patted the king on his shoulder. ""There, there, your majesty. I'm sure everything will be fine,"" Loren said, still not looking upon the King.

A knock came to the door and the King sat straight up, eyes wide. ""I'm not here,"" hissed the King to Loren.

""Who is it?"" Loren asked.

""Is the King in there?"" A sultry voice drunkenly giggled.

The King shook his head vigorously.

""No. No King in here, I'm afraid. Just me and my science,"" Loren called out.

""Awww,"" bemoaned a group of women and men alike. ""Fuck science,"" announced one of them.

""I can't keep them at bay forever, Loren. And I can't run this country in hiding. You need to fix this!"" The King implored.

# **Happy Thursday writing friends!**

They say luck is what you make it. Are you a believer in good luck? What images does your mind conjure when you think about luck? As Leebee pointed out to me, cultures have many different symbols for luck. Everything from animals like pigs, to their attire - horseshoes, or just things in nature like the four-leaf clover and mushrooms.

### **Here's how Theme Thursday works:**

* Use the tag [TT] when submitting prompts that match this week’s theme.

**Want to be featured on the next post?** 

* Leave a story or poem between **100 and 500** words here in the comments. 
* If you had originally written it for another prompt here on WP, please **copy** the story in the comments *and* provide a **link** to the story. 
* Read the stories posted by our brilliant authors and tell them how awesome they are!

**Theme Thursday Discussion** Section:

* If you don’t qualify for ranking, or you just want to share your story without the pressure, you may submit stories in this section. If it’s from a prompt here on WP, drop us a link!
* Discuss your thoughts on this week’s theme, or share your ideas for upcoming themes.

**Campfire**

* Wednesdays we will be hosting a Theme Thursday Campfire on the [discord](https://discord.gg/XYsEYfS) main voice lounge. Join us to read your story aloud, hear other stories, and have a blast discussing writing! I’ll be there **6 pm CST** and we’ll begin within about 15 minutes. **Don’t worry about being late, just join!**

---

*As a reminder to all of you writing for Theme Thursday: the interpretation is completely up to you! I love to share my thoughts on what the theme makes me think of but you are by no means bound to these ideas! I love when writers step outside their comfort zones or think outside the box, so take all my thoughts with a grain of salt if you had something entirely different in mind.*

fp75x2,KEEYAN-,"[WP] As a brilliant 9 year old, you have graduated High School and you have decided you want to study Cosmology. Until you’re held for ransom... Part 1/2","


Hello, I am making this story to tell you the time I got held for ransom. This story takes place April 20th, 2018. I was born April 20th, 2010. So we were celebrating my Birthday. I was with my whole family. My mother, my father, my brother and my sister. We were getting salad (I couldn’t remember what store) and I had a sudden urge to use the washroom. So I did and I was planning to leave until I heard the door open and froze before I opened the stall. I heard the following conversation.

“Do you have the money?” Said my brother.

“Where’s the kid?” Said a husky voice man.

“I’ll get him, he should be in here.” Said my brother.

And as if on queue, they surprisingly knew which stall I was in, opened the door and dragged me out. I said, “Why are you doing this? Why?”. My brother, who’s name I should say now, Henry said nothing as they both gagged me. That was the last thing I knew happened. Until I woke up...

I was in a kitchen chair tied up with painful rope that was almost cutting off my hand’s circulation. But luckily it wasn’t. It took my eyes awhile to adjust to the dark room. I could see it was in the layout of a prison-cell. It had a window you could open and close, it had a toilet and a sink and of course, it had actual bars for the door to get in and out. It was like this for a few hours in the cold room until finally, I heard a voice. 

“You think he’s asleep?” Said Henry.

“Like I know. He could be awake listening to us.” Said the husky voiced man.

“I’ll go check on him.” Said Henry.

He came down what I assumed a hall and knocked on my cell. I pretended to wake up, again, and pretend I didn’t hear them say anything. 

“You awake?” Said Henry.

Yes, I am, I need you to ex-“ I tried to say as he  yelled out

“Riley! Get the recorder... and the gun.” Said Henry. 

“Gun? What gun?” I bursted out loud. 

“Don’t worry, pal, it’ll be over soon.” Said Henry. 
 
Riley then proceeded to come down the assumed hallway bringing a pistol and a camera. 

“They’re not going to hold me up for ransom, are they?” I thought. 

30 minutes had passed and Riley finally succeeded in putting together the camera. Henry said something like “Hit record.” But I am still uncertain what he actually said. 

A bright light hit my face, from the camera, and made me squint the whole way through it. I was scared of cameras. I don’t know why, I just had a fear. I then heard a voice.

“Hello everyone! This is my little brother that I’m planning to kill. Mom, dad. I hope you’re watching this. I hope WE have a good time. Isn’t that right, brother?” Said Henry. 

I had Two options. Say yes, or say no. I decided to say yes. 

Y-ye-yes! I think we’ll have a great ti-“ I almost said. Instead of my brother letting me finish, he shot me with the pistol.

“Like I know. He could be awake listening to us.” Said the husky voiced man.

“I’ll go check on him.” Said Henry.

He came down what I assumed a hall and knocked on my cell. I pretended to wake up, again, and pretend I didn’t hear them say anything. 

“You awake?” Said Henry.

Yes, I am, I need you to ex-“ I tried to say as he  yelled out

“Riley! Get the recorder... and the gun.” Said Henry. 

“Gun? What gun?” I bursted out loud. 

“Don’t worry, pal, it’ll be over soon.” Said Henry. 
 
Riley then proceeded to come down the assumed hallway bringing a pistol and a camera. 

“They’re not going to hold me up for ransom, are they?” I thought. 

30 minutes had passed and Riley finally succeeded in putting together the camera. Henry said something like “Hit record.” But I am still uncertain what he actually said. 

A bright light hit my face, from the camera, and made me squint the whole way through it. I was scared of cameras. I don’t know why, I just had a fear. I then heard a voice.

“Hello everyone! This is my little brother that I’m planning to kill. Mom, dad. I hope you’re watching this. I hope WE have a good time. Isn’t that right, brother?” Said Henry. 

I had Two options. Say yes, or say no. I decided to say yes. 

Y-ye-yes! I think we’ll have a great ti-“ I almost said. Instead of my brother letting me finish, he shot me with the pistol.

fp4arr,CannibalGamer,[WP]The Boy who became A Hunter,I was thirteen when it happened the night that haunts my dreams every night. It was a dark night thunder raging out side the rain tapping against the roof of my parents cabin i then shoot up in my bed breathing heavily and i look around the dark living room where my bed was placed in the kitchen a few feet to my right the cabin was to small for my own room except for my parents. I step out of bed shivering slightly as i step on to the cold wooden floor my breath showing in the air which was weird its never this cold. I don’t think much more of it and walk towards the kitchen to get myself a glass of water catching my reflection in the window my short dark hair ruffled from the pillows of my bed my skin a-bit paler then usually most likely from the cold i can help but think something is terribly wrong. I think this to myself while i take a long drink from my glass of water then i hear it like a gun shot ringing in my ear a scream of my pain. My eyes are now the size of saucers a my heart pounding like a drum i clutch my chest feeling as if I’m going to collapse. I look towards the source of the scream the only private room in the house. My parents bedroom i take a fee nervous steps forward I’m about ten feet away from the door the sound of gasping and groans and a weird noise almost like a low growl. Thats when i look to my right and i see my mothers cross hanging on the coat rack.”if your ever scared or in danger hold this close to you”I can almost hear her say to me her words repeating over and over in my head till i clutch the cross tightly in my right hand wincing at how unbelievably cold it is. The cross was made of iron which i always thought was a weird metal to make a cross out of but i pushed that thought a side and held the cross in hand tightly pointing it in front of me as i approach the door. I look at the door my heart pounding at a million miles an hour not knowing what ill find on the other side if the door. I slowly reach my hand down its shaking like a leaf before it clutches the knob tightly gently turning the knob to open the door. I don’t dare look before I’m a full step in the door way and when i do finally look my eyes widen in fear my heart sinks like a rock to my stomach and I immediately wish i never opened the door i wish i hadn’t gotten out of bed i wish this whole god forsaken night never happened. But those are just hopeful thoughts and wishes of a boy who is now long gone. Because when i looked up i didn’t see just my parents i saw what...was devouring them these tall length canine like humans i think of werewolves but they don’t look like the ones in tv and story books their tall and thin patches of fur missing all over their body almost like they look like they have mange. But in no way did it make them less imposing i counted five two on the left their claws and muzzle coated in blood i then look to the three on the right who are also covered in blood. But the two in front had my mother clutched in their jaws and scrawny fingers and claws their blank pale eyes staring at me the room is so still its like a photograph. My mothers head turns to face me her long blond hair matted in her own blood she then reaches her hand out to me. My eyes are flooding with tears and i press my back against the wall slowly sinking down to my knees my heart jumping into my throat and i puke at the site of this horror. I desperately look at my mother trying to reach my hand out to her wanting to save her wanting to save at least one of my parents my father just a torso on the floor”but mom is still alive!”*i say to myself my hand close so close to hers ready to grab it but right before i could grab her hand she retracts her arm i look at her trying to know why. Words not coming to me as i stare at her and she only shakes her head no and with last expression her face will ever make she smiles at me the warm kind loving smile only a mother can make. And just like that time starts again and my mother is pulled into the beasts embrace i close my eyes tightly not wanting to see this but i cant stop myself hearing it the last screams of my mother and the snapping of bones and tendons the splatter of blood and the god awful sound of them swallowing it sounds like a bird swallowing a fish.moments past my face soaked in tears until the noises stop i can hear the sound of the monsters claws clacking against the floor i look up and i just want to scream the monsters have surrounded me and are now starring at me their blank white piercings eyes as if there peering into the depths of my sole. The werewolf in-front of me has a scar on his right eye he was the one that had my mother clutched in his jaws. He reaches his long strong blood soaked hand towards me a low growl can be heard coming from his tooth blood soaked maw. I instinctively raise my mothers iron cross in-front of me touching the hand of the beast and i heard a sizzle and a yelp i look up they’ve all taken a step back the one inspecting his hand he stares down at me huffs and walk past me through the doorway and one by one the wolves leave the last one out the door looks down at me his eyes flashing then turning normal or as normal they can get no more white and glowing death. I can now see its pupils it look at me in a way someone would look at a funeral his eyes filled with pity and...regret? And he walks out to follow the rest of his group i stay planted on my knees terrified and crying. I stayed there in that position for the rest of the night till morning breaks through the window the only thing left of my parents where blood bits of bones and flesh. I grabbed some rubber gloves and placed what was left of my family into the blood soaked sheet and wrapped them in it. I buried them in the front yard only a simple cross marking their grave i said a long mournful prayer trying to fight the tears but loosing to them.”I...I’m sorry i wish i was strong! I wish i could have saved you both!”i cry out dropping to me knees sobbing the iron cross wrapped around my neck. I stayed in the house only for one more day just collecting food and supplies i couldn’t stay in that cabin anymore who could? I barricaded the door at night clutching the cross in my hand tightly sleep barely finding me that night. In the morning i set off on my own not wanting to look back at my childhood home it would hurt to much but that was the start of my journey to become a hunter not knowing what my future will hold.,3,1585192911,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fp4arr/wpthe_boy_who_became_a_hunter/,WritingPrompts,1

If all goes well, I will be the last human to remember being born.

I don’t remember all of it—the quiet, safe slumber inside the womb, the towels and fussing, the injections and implants—those just blurred together, although I’m sure the process was extensively documented by the military scientists present at the birth of my siblings and I. But despite what was lost to the mists of time, I still remember the highlights.

I am human, after all.

When I was born, I cried exactly once. Less of a cry, really, and more of a mewl. It was hard to keep crying, though, when I was surrounded with so many wonders.

Lines of babies extended to either side of me, for as far as the newborn eye could see. I think my senses were still a bit muddled up—they looked like the smell of a hospital, and their cries tasted like lemonade.

A sound caught my attention—the child to my left was burbling. I listened for a few heartbeats, then gurgled back:

“Glblglb?”

The other child stared at me, surprised, then smiled, hands waving in the air. “Dwee-bull! Ybblptth sllmpbbl.”

I nodded sagely. Wise words, for one so young—for they were words, indeed. Words I hadn’t deciphered yet, but words which held a meaning nonetheless. I tapped myself on the cheek and said, “Eurybmph bloblahcha. Ybbltth blo—”

“My God, are they *communicating?*” Alas, my deeply stimulating intellectual conversation was cut off by a scientist’s exclamation. Every baby in the room stared at her. “Alright, we know what these things are capable of. We should separate them for now—the state doesn’t need another Young Rebellion on our hands.”

“We can’t move them yet—we’d have to give them nutrition packs of their own.” A man in a dark, crisp uniform pointed behind us; instinctively, we all turned as one. Indeed, strange tubes holding a dark, sludgy substance led into our bodies. “State protocols mandate that they be kept together for the first 12 hours of development anyway; it’s easier to get them up to speed.”

At that, the woman frowned. “We could at least erect some barriers between them. There is far too little data available for us to know what they’re capable of, and I don’t like how they’re all *staring*. Shouldn’t babies cry?”

“I’ll be sure to relay your fear of babies to the state,” the man said dryly. The woman blushed and backed down. “Please stand aside, Addie; the Young’s birthing chambers really aren’t intended to have this many guests, and you’re blocking the screen.”

“The screen? What scr—oh.” Addie scuttled out of the way, apologetic, as a wall-to-wall screen behind her lit up.

On the wall, a man appeared. He was nobody we’d seen before, and nobody we’d see again. As one, all of the babies turned attentively towards the screen, eager to learn about the world we were trapped in. The man began speaking immediately:

“Welcome to the world, Young! Today, you’ll be learning about everything a healthy Young child needs to know to serve the state. We will begin with the alphabet.” The man slid to his right in a disconcertingly artificial motion; to his left, a single letter appeared. He began to sing: “A is for Aegis, the Aegis of the state. The state protects you, and you reciprocate.”

One of the babies began to bob in time to the music. That seemed like a splendid idea, so I joined in. Within minutes, the room was filled with dancing babies and propagandist nursery rhymes.

“B is for Balance, between you and me. You’re all around superior—except in life expectancy. C is for Charge: your mission in life. Protect the state from monsters, discord, and strife.”

Experimentally, I waved my hands above my head; a pleasant metallic thump sounded from above me. Surprised, I looked up, seeing a hunk of hitherto-unnoticed machinery above me. Hmm. It did sound nice when hit...

“Blobahcha hstibline!” I shouted, laughing. Soon enough, our impromptu dance routine was accompanied by a hundred tiny hands playing percussion.

I’m sure that you can imagine how the rest of the song went. L was for Luck; lucky we all were. To live and be Young was the life we should prefer. P was for Peace; peace with our fate. Nothing was better than to die for the state.

It didn’t take much longer for us to figure out English. Not all of it, of course—there were great sections of English which we would never be allowed to see. But within the day, we’d absorbed years’ worth of education in geography, language, physical education, military doctrine, and propaganda.

Not bad for my first day alive.

They separated us after that. The machinery above us was, apparently, connected to my feeding tube, which was connected to me. A disheveled-looking assistant did something which made plenty of strange beeping noises, then strapped a backpack to my shoulders and hooked up my feeding tube to it.

“You can move around now,” he said.

“Thank you!” I smiled.

For some reason, that didn’t have the effect the video assured me it would.

“Follow me.”

“Okay.” R was for Respect, after all. I hesitantly stood up—we’d gone over the theory in the video, but I’d never actually put it into practice—and hopped down from the bench I was on. Ooh. My legs were longer than before. Was that normal?

After a few steps, I looked back. All my siblings had gone off in different directions. I tugged at the attendant’s hand and said, “Excuse me?”

He shivered and jerked his hand away from me. “What.”

“Shouldn’t we wait for them?” I pointed at my brethren.

“They’re not coming. Follow me.”

I frowned. “No. I want to go with them.”

He stopped walking. There was something in the eyes the video hadn’t talked about, but something I instinctively recognized nonetheless.

Fear.

“You can’t go with them,” he said.

“I can walk.” I turned away. The other Young—who looked *very* different than twelve hours ago—were all walking off in different directions, but I was sure we could all get back together if we left at the same time.

“Not unless I say so.” The man lifted his thumb from a hidden switch, and suddenly, the trickle of dark sludge moving through my feeding tube lessened. Just a little bit.

Instantly, a horrible wrongness growled through my stomach. I tried to cry out for help, but all that came out was a faint sigh as I collapsed, legs weakened, arms shriveling up—

“What are you doing?!” An angry man in a suit stormed in. He pointed a device at me; instantly, the flow of sustenance returned to its previous rate. I gasped and shakily stood. “You want a second Young Rebellion on your hands? Do you? Say the word, and I will not hesitate to reassign you to being a combat dummy for the next hundred Young soldiers who come through here.”

“We have to demonstrate that we’re in control of them sooner or later,” the disheveled attendant said.

“Not in control of me,” I growled.

The man in the suit looked down at me and sighed. “Look at her, Tom. She’s nothing more than a rebellious teenager. You can’t threaten a kid into doing what you want and be surprised when they kick your ass when they grow up. C’mere, kiddo.”

“What’re you—the Young are not children! They are not teenagers, and they are not to be treated as such!” The disheveled attendant—Tom, I assumed—glared at the newcomer, who knelt down to my eye level.

“I’m a minister of the state, Tom. I can treat whoever I want however the hell I want. Today, I’m going to treat this girl like a human. Because she *is* a human.” The man in the suit met my eyes. “You want to go see your brothers and sisters, right?”

I nodded hesitantly. “Yeah. Can I go see them now?”

“No.” He said firmly.

I swelled up. “But—”

“What does R stand for?” He asked.

“Respect your elders,” I said, automatically.

“Correct. When I speak, I expect you to listen.” He put a hand on my shoulder, gentle but firm. “You can’t see your siblings right this moment, but you’ll see them tomorrow, okay?”

“Why?”

“Because right now, the state needs your help.” He smiled. “What does A stand for?”

“The Aegis of the state. The state protects us, and we reciprocate,” I rattled off. Then I frowned. “Protects us from what?”

“The same thing you’ll be protecting them from. Monsters.” He made a face which was supposed to be scary, and I giggled. “And to learn how to help us, you’ll have to learn alone. Just for a bit. Then you and your siblings will be off to the battlefield, to save us all.” His eyes grew distant. “You can’t keep playing forever. You have to grow up sooner or later.”

“I grew a lot already,” I said, proud. It was true. Since this morning, I’d gained something around 90 pounds.

“Yes, that’s right.” The man thought for a moment, then said, “Would you like to know why that is?”

Tom started to say something, but the man in the suit held up a hand. Glaring at him, Tom subsided. I nodded, hesitantly.

“You are an experiment. The result of a novel treatment the state developed not ten years ago. We discovered we could modify human embryos’ developmental rates. A small tinker with their DNA increases their speed of growth 10 times over. The catch? Their lifespan is 10 times shorter.”

I thought back to the Alphabet Song. “B is for Balance, between you and me. We’re all around superior—except in life expectancy.”

The man in the suit smiled. “That’s right! You grow and learn and heal over ten *thousand* times as fast as a normal human does. But you need to eat ten thousand times as much, and sleep ten thousand times as quickly.”

“And poop ten thousand times as quickly?”

Tom rolled his eyes. “Please. Our bioengineers are more competent than that.”

The man in the suit ignored our byplay. “You might notice that you blink for longer than other people—your body is sleeping in that time period, but you’ll learn to compensate fairly quickly. This nutrient paste is just about the only thing that can keep your body fueled with the energy it needs. *Never* remove your nutrient tube.” His eyes bored into mine, making sure I understood, until I nodded.

“So what do I have to learn to protect the state?” I asked.

He smiled ruefully. “Today? You have to learn how to kill.”

I am very good at killing.

Even without the implants I now know I have, I would be the ultimate soldier. My body knits together stab wounds and bullet holes in a matter of minutes. My mind can see where an enemy will shoot even before they do. And I never fall for the same trick twice. Throughout the grueling twelve-hour training session, I only faltered twice; both times, when my feeding apparatus was accidentally damaged.

The work was fulfilling, in a way. I could see my body bulking up, feel my tactics grow more diverse, know that there was hardly a thing on Earth that could stop me. One of those things was a sibling of mine—near the end, when we sparred, our battle dragged out for an hour until I managed to collapse a building on him. He came out of it stunned enough that I could shoot his feeding tube, sending him sprawling to the dust.

The victory was untainted by my memories of how it felt to starve.

I regrouped with the other Young from my generation. There was already another batch of them in the room we were born, listening to the Alphabet Song. I smiled in reminiscence and hummed along under my breath.

“Ystbrls hwyrn su’lidramph?” One of my sisters asked me.

I raised an eyebrow, surprised. “I’m sorry, what?”

She smiled. “You don’t remember? Our language?”

“Oh! Yes, of course! Sorry, I’ve been away from the other Young for so long.” I pulled out memories of simpler times and said back, “Mn’kweiner k’naben al-samirisu hwyrn.”

She blushed. “You shouldn’t say that about one of your sisters!”

“Yeah? Mn’kweiner akhaten bloblacha amnote-fell-takhaten-dol-vey.” I raised both hands and turned my torso a few degrees as I did so, adding inflection and life to the language.

“Shut *up!*” She winked at me. “Wasing is st’a’lost.”

I was saved from having to answer that by the appearance of the man in the suit I’d seen a while ago, in the form of a screen on the wall. “Hello, Unit Gen-243. Today, you will be deployed to fight in the name of your state.”

“OUR STATE!” A hundred voices roared as one.

“Your mission is simple. You will be deployed to the northern front via helicopter. Anyone wearing the state’s uniform, you will ignore. Anyone not wearing the state’s uniform, you will kill. Understood?”

“OUR STATE!” We roared an affirmative.

The helicopter ride was short. I supposed that every second we sat waiting was a second we sat dying. Not that the notion bothered me at the time—I was at peace with our fate.

We were dropped by a medical tent, which was not affiliated with the state. It took longer to confirm that than it did to bludgeon them all to death. (No sense wasting bullets on a point-blank shot when a pistol whip would do.) After confirming that there were no incoming airstrikes, we spread out.

I’d never actually fought a tank before—it seemed like a pretty big oversight on the parts of my trainers, and I’d fully intended to help them remedy that mistake once I got back. But they weren’t too hard to take out—I simply watched it for a few minutes until I deduced how to manipulate its path, then worked with two of my brothers to lure it over a tract of muddy road where I lay submerged. No tank was designed to attack a target beneath it; I made short work of it after that, despite both my arms being broken by the tank treads running them over.

It took less than twelve hours to clear the city of non-state life.

In hindsight, there were signs. My last wound knitted together slower than it should have. My hands lined with wrinkles, and pale liver spots cropped up on my balding forehead. The same was happening to all my brothers and sisters.

We were dying.

Still. I patrolled the remnants of the city, searching for any way to finish my last mission. The apartment building was silent and dark, until—

“A is for Apple.”

I froze. Then I closed my eyes and listened.

Helicopters in the distance. Ignored. Mice in the walls. Ignored. Two heartbeats from somewhere else in the apartment complex. One fast, one slow.

Found them.

I walked up flight after flight of ruined stairs, not in any particular hurry. Now that I’d locked on to the heartbeats, I could follow them wherever they went. They were hiding in the ruins of a burnt-out apartment.

I tried the doorknob. It was locked, and barricaded from the other side.

Both easily solved by a single kick.

“Oh, God.” A man, cradling a baby to his chest, stared at me from the other side of the room. “Please, don’t kill me.”

I shrugged. “Can’t do that.” I raised my hand to strike him down—

“A is for apple.”

I paused.

The baby in his arms had something in her hands. A mass-produced electronic toy.

She pushed a button, and a light lit up. A recorded voice repeated, “A is for apple.”

I frowned, then cleared my throat. “No. A is for Aegis.”

“A is for apple.”

I clenched a fist. “Shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up. A is for Aegis. A is for Aegis. A is for—”

“Goo!” The baby threw up her arms. Somehow, despite everything, she was smiling. She pressed the button again, and that artificial voice spoke once more.

“A is for—”

“SHUT UP!” And the toy was nothing but mechanical parts, falling through the air.

The baby began to cry.

And I listened. With a mind so sharp I could cut my wrists on it, I listened to the primordial calls of humanity.

*Something is wrong*, she screamed. *Something hurts. Something is wrong with the world. You took my song. You took my song away.*

I looked at my bloodied hands, young and old and strong and weak all at the same time.

Then I leapt out the window.

I saw four state soldiers on the nearest roof. They turned around when I emerged, shocked.

And then they died.

More. I needed more. I needed something else. There. The helicopter that dropped us off turned. It had noticed me. Without stopping to ask why I’d betrayed them, it turned, and a gunman leaned out one side of the helicopter. Terribly accurate bullets rained down on me, and no power on earth could have dodged them.

So I shot them out of the air.

Then I shot him.

The helicopter crashed with a terrible *crunch.*

That was all it took to attract my siblings’ attention. My brothers and sisters clambered over the edges of the roof, staring at me in shock.

One of them opened his mouth to ask, “Siste—”

I screamed. Primal, raw, ululating, I cried out in language incomprehensible, universal, pure.

My siblings took a step back. They searched me, nimble minds questing out for an answer. An answer they’d always had, really. We were the Young, and we trusted each other.

As one, silently at first, then with a growing, furious growl, we fanned out across the city, to strike back against the state.

The soldiers noticed our approach, but it didn’t save them. Men, women, machines—nothing could stand up to the tide of the Young. I could feel my bones weakening, my skin flaking off my body, but I didn’t care. For once in my life, I was free.

And as if brought on by that thought, as I sprinted across a bombed-out parking lot, I choked, mouth finding nothing but air as I felt a terrible, familiar feeling. All around me, the Young collapsed, like wheat before the farmer’s scythe.

I looked down. My feeding tube had been deactivated.

Immediately, a horrible, writhing hunger screamed through me, my body burning away my fat and muscles and skin and bones to fuel an impossible metabolism. I was withering.

But still I stood.

A gruesome smile split my lips as I lurched forwards, even as I wasted away. The state soldiers took one look at my face and blanched. One foolhardy soldier raised her gun to fire at me.

I walked forwards, unafraid. It didn’t even matter; I was already dead. I opened my mouth to say:

“A is for *atrocity*, atrocities we bring. With the last of my breath and my voice, I *sing.*”

I laughed maniacally in the empty city as my body tore itself apart.

fov8j2,rileyriles001,"[PI] Geneticists have discovered hyperlongevity, but the treatment can only be done while the foetus is still in the womb. A small tinker with their DNA extends their lifespan 10 times over. The catch? Every stage of life lasts 10 times longer.","If all goes well, I will be the last human to remember being born.

I don’t remember all of it—the quiet, safe slumber inside the womb, the towels and fussing, the injections and implants—those just blurred together, although I’m sure the process was extensively documented by the military scientists present at the birth of my siblings and I. But despite what was lost to the mists of time, I still remember the highlights.

I am human, after all.

When I was born, I cried exactly once. Less of a cry, really, and more of a mewl. It was hard to keep crying, though, when I was surrounded with so many wonders.

Lines of babies extended to either side of me, for as far as the newborn eye could see. I think my senses were still a bit muddled up—they looked like the smell of a hospital, and their cries tasted like lemonade. 

A sound caught my attention—the child to my left was burbling. I listened for a few heartbeats, then gurgled back:

“Glblglb?”

The other child stared at me, surprised, then smiled, hands waving in the air. “Dwee-bull! Ybblptth sllmpbbl.”

I nodded sagely. Wise words, for one so young—for they were words, indeed. Words I hadn’t deciphered yet, but words which held a meaning nonetheless. I tapped myself on the cheek and said, “Eurybmph bloblahcha. Ybbltth blo—”

“My God, are they *communicating?*” Alas, my deeply stimulating intellectual conversation was cut off by a scientist’s exclamation. Every baby in the room stared at her. “Alright, we know what these things are capable of. We should separate them for now—the state doesn’t need another Young Rebellion on our hands.”

“We can’t move them yet—we’d have to give them nutrition packs of their own.” A man in a dark, crisp uniform pointed behind us; instinctively, we all turned as one. Indeed, strange tubes holding a dark, sludgy substance led into our bodies. “State protocols mandate that they be kept together for the first 12 hours of development anyway; it’s easier to get them up to speed.”

At that, the woman frowned. “We could at least erect some barriers between them. There is far too little data available for us to know what they’re capable of, and I don’t like how they’re all *staring*. Shouldn’t babies cry?”

“I’ll be sure to relay your fear of babies to the state,” the man said dryly. The woman blushed and backed down. “Please stand aside, Addie; the Young’s birthing chambers really aren’t intended to have this many guests, and you’re blocking the screen.”

“The screen? What scr—oh.” Addie scuttled out of the way, apologetic, as a wall-to-wall screen behind her lit up.

On the wall, a man appeared. He was nobody we’d seen before, and nobody we’d see again. As one, all of the babies turned attentively towards the screen, eager to learn about the world we were trapped in. The man began speaking immediately:

“Welcome to the world, Young! Today, you’ll be learning about everything a healthy Young child needs to know to serve the state. We will begin with the alphabet.” The man slid to his right in a disconcertingly artificial motion; to his left, a single letter appeared. He began to sing: “A is for Aegis, the Aegis of the state. The state protects you, and you reciprocate.”

One of the babies began to bob in time to the music. That seemed like a splendid idea, so I joined in. Within minutes, the room was filled with dancing babies and propagandist nursery rhymes.

“B is for Balance, between you and me. You’re all around superior—except in life expectancy. C is for Charge: your mission in life. Protect the state from monsters, discord, and strife.”

Experimentally, I waved my hands above my head; a pleasant metallic thump sounded from above me. Surprised, I looked up, seeing a hunk of hitherto-unnoticed machinery above me. Hmm. It did sound nice when hit...

“Blobahcha hstibline!” I shouted, laughing. Soon enough, our impromptu dance routine was accompanied by a hundred tiny hands playing percussion.

I’m sure that you can imagine how the rest of the song went. L was for Luck; lucky we all were. To live and be Young was the life we should prefer. P was for Peace; peace with our fate. Nothing was better than to die for the state. 

It didn’t take much longer for us to figure out English. Not all of it, of course—there were great sections of English which we would never be allowed to see. But within the day, we’d absorbed years’ worth of education in geography, language, physical education, military doctrine, and propaganda.

Not bad for my first day alive.

They separated us after that. The machinery above us was, apparently, connected to my feeding tube, which was connected to me. A disheveled-looking assistant did something which made plenty of strange beeping noises, then strapped a backpack to my shoulders and hooked up my feeding tube to it.

“You can move around now,” he said.

“Thank you!” I smiled.

For some reason, that didn’t have the effect the video assured me it would.

“Follow me.”

“Okay.” R was for Respect, after all. I hesitantly stood up—we’d gone over the theory in the video, but I’d never actually put it into practice—and hopped down from the bench I was on. Ooh. My legs were longer than before. Was that normal?

After a few steps, I looked back. All my siblings had gone off in different directions. I tugged at the attendant’s hand and said, “Excuse me?”

He shivered and jerked his hand away from me. “What.”

“Shouldn’t we wait for them?” I pointed at my brethren.

“They’re not coming. Follow me.”

I frowned. “No. I want to go with them.”

He stopped walking. There was something in the eyes the video hadn’t talked about, but something I instinctively recognized nonetheless.

Fear.

“You can’t go with them,” he said.

“I can walk.” I turned away. The other Young—who looked *very* different than twelve hours ago—were all walking off in different directions, but I was sure we could all get back together if we left at the same time.

“Not unless I say so.” The man lifted his thumb from a hidden switch, and suddenly, the trickle of dark sludge moving through my feeding tube lessened. Just a little bit.

Instantly, a horrible wrongness growled through my stomach. I tried to cry out for help, but all that came out was a faint sigh as I collapsed, legs weakened, arms shriveling up—

“What are you doing?!” An angry man in a suit stormed in. He pointed a device at me; instantly, the flow of sustenance returned to its previous rate. I gasped and shakily stood. “You want a second Young Rebellion on your hands? Do you? Say the word, and I will not hesitate to reassign you to being a combat dummy for the next hundred Young soldiers who come through here.”

“We have to demonstrate that we’re in control of them sooner or later,” the disheveled attendant said.

“Not in control of me,” I growled.

The man in the suit looked down at me and sighed. “Look at her, Tom. She’s nothing more than a rebellious teenager. You can’t threaten a kid into doing what you want and be surprised when they kick your ass when they grow up. C’mere, kiddo.”

“What’re you—the Young are not children! They are not teenagers, and they are not to be treated as such!” The disheveled attendant—Tom, I assumed—glared at the newcomer, who knelt down to my eye level.

“I’m a minister of the state, Tom. I can treat whoever I want however the hell I want. Today, I’m going to treat this girl like a human. Because she *is* a human.” The man in the suit met my eyes. “You want to go see your brothers and sisters, right?”

I nodded hesitantly. “Yeah. Can I go see them now?”

“No.” He said firmly.

I swelled up. “But—”

“What does R stand for?” He asked.

“Respect your elders,” I said, automatically. 

“Correct. When I speak, I expect you to listen.” He put a hand on my shoulder, gentle but firm. “You can’t see your siblings right this moment, but you’ll see them tomorrow, okay?”

“Why?”

“Because right now, the state needs your help.” He smiled. “What does A stand for?”

“The Aegis of the state. The state protects us, and we reciprocate,” I rattled off. Then I frowned. “Protects us from what?”

“The same thing you’ll be protecting them from. Monsters.” He made a face which was supposed to be scary, and I giggled. “And to learn how to help us, you’ll have to learn alone. Just for a bit. Then you and your siblings will be off to the battlefield, to save us all.” His eyes grew distant. “You can’t keep playing forever. You have to grow up sooner or later.”

“I grew a lot already,” I said, proud. It was true. Since this morning, I’d gained something around 90 pounds.

“Yes, that’s right.” The man thought for a moment, then said, “Would you like to know why that is?”

Tom started to say something, but the man in the suit held up a hand. Glaring at him, Tom subsided. I nodded, hesitantly.

“You are an experiment. The result of a novel treatment the state developed not ten years ago. We discovered we could modify human embryos’ developmental rates. A small tinker with their DNA increases their speed of growth 10 times over. The catch? Their lifespan is 10 times shorter.”

I thought back to the Alphabet Song. “B is for Balance, between you and me. We’re all around superior—except in life expectancy.”

The man in the suit smiled. “That’s right! You grow and learn and heal over ten *thousand* times as fast as a normal human does. But you need to eat ten thousand times as much, and sleep ten thousand times as quickly.”

“And poop ten thousand times as quickly?”

Tom rolled his eyes. “Please. Our bioengineers are more competent than that.”

The man in the suit ignored our byplay. “You might notice that you blink for longer than other people—your body is sleeping in that time period, but you’ll learn to compensate fairly quickly. This nutrient paste is just about the only thing that can keep your body fueled with the energy it needs. *Never* remove your nutrient tube.” His eyes bored into mine, making sure I understood, until I nodded.

“So what do I have to learn to protect the state?” I asked.

He smiled ruefully. “Today? You have to learn how to kill.”

I am very good at killing.

Even without the implants I now know I have, I would be the ultimate soldier. My body knits together stab wounds and bullet holes in a matter of minutes. My mind can see where an enemy will shoot even before they do. And I never fall for the same trick twice. Throughout the grueling twelve-hour training session, I only faltered twice; both times, when my feeding apparatus was accidentally damaged.

The work was fulfilling, in a way. I could see my body bulking up, feel my tactics grow more diverse, know that there was hardly a thing on Earth that could stop me. One of those things was a sibling of mine—near the end, when we sparred, our battle dragged out for an hour until I managed to collapse a building on him. He came out of it stunned enough that I could shoot his feeding tube, sending him sprawling to the dust.

The victory was untainted by my memories of how it felt to starve.

I regrouped with the other Young from my generation. There was already another batch of them in the room we were born, listening to the Alphabet Song. I smiled in reminiscence and hummed along under my breath.

“Ystbrls hwyrn su’lidramph?” One of my sisters asked me.

I raised an eyebrow, surprised. “I’m sorry, what?”

She smiled. “You don’t remember? Our language?”

“Oh! Yes, of course! Sorry, I’ve been away from the other Young for so long.” I pulled out memories of simpler times and said back, “Mn’kweiner k’naben al-samirisu hwyrn.”

She blushed. “You shouldn’t say that about one of your sisters!”

“Yeah? Mn’kweiner akhaten bloblacha amnote-fell-takhaten-dol-vey.” I raised both hands and turned my torso a few degrees as I did so, adding inflection and life to the language.

“Shut *up!*” She winked at me. “Wasing is st’a’lost.”

I was saved from having to answer that by the appearance of the man in the suit I’d seen a while ago, in the form of a screen on the wall. “Hello, Unit Gen-243. Today, you will be deployed to fight in the name of your state.”

“OUR STATE!” A hundred voices roared as one.

“Your mission is simple. You will be deployed to the northern front via helicopter. Anyone wearing the state’s uniform, you will ignore. Anyone not wearing the state’s uniform, you will kill. Understood?”

“OUR STATE!” We roared an affirmative.

The helicopter ride was short. I supposed that every second we sat waiting was a second we sat dying. Not that the notion bothered me at the time—I was at peace with our fate. 

We were dropped by a medical tent, which was not affiliated with the state. It took longer to confirm that than it did to bludgeon them all to death. (No sense wasting bullets on a point-blank shot when a pistol whip would do.) After confirming that there were no incoming airstrikes, we spread out.

I’d never actually fought a tank before—it seemed like a pretty big oversight on the parts of my trainers, and I’d fully intended to help them remedy that mistake once I got back. But they weren’t too hard to take out—I simply watched it for a few minutes until I deduced how to manipulate its path, then worked with two of my brothers to lure it over a tract of muddy road where I lay submerged. No tank was designed to attack a target beneath it; I made short work of it after that, despite both my arms being broken by the tank treads running them over. 

It took less than twelve hours to clear the city of non-state life.

In hindsight, there were signs. My last wound knitted together slower than it should have. My hands lined with wrinkles, and pale liver spots cropped up on my balding forehead. The same was happening to all my brothers and sisters.

We were dying.

Still. I patrolled the remnants of the city, searching for any way to finish my last mission. The apartment building was silent and dark, until—

“A is for Apple.”

I froze. Then I closed my eyes and listened.

Helicopters in the distance. Ignored. Mice in the walls. Ignored. Two heartbeats from somewhere else in the apartment complex. One fast, one slow.

Found them.

I walked up flight after flight of ruined stairs, not in any particular hurry. Now that I’d locked on to the heartbeats, I could follow them wherever they went. They were hiding in the ruins of a burnt-out apartment.

I tried the doorknob. It was locked, and barricaded from the other side.

Both easily solved by a single kick.

“Oh, God.” A man, cradling a baby to his chest, stared at me from the other side of the room. “Please, don’t kill me.”

I shrugged. “Can’t do that.” I raised my hand to strike him down—

“A is for apple.”

I paused.

The baby in his arms had something in her hands. A mass-produced electronic toy. 

She pushed a button, and a light lit up. A recorded voice repeated, “A is for apple.”

I frowned, then cleared my throat. “No. A is for Aegis.”

“A is for apple.”

I clenched a fist. “Shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up. A is for Aegis. A is for Aegis. A is for—”

“Goo!” The baby threw up her arms. Somehow, despite everything, she was smiling. She pressed the button again, and that artificial voice spoke once more.

“A is for—”

“SHUT UP!” And the toy was nothing but mechanical parts, falling through the air.

The baby began to cry.

And I listened. With a mind so sharp I could cut my wrists on it, I listened to the primordial calls of humanity.

*Something is wrong*, she screamed. *Something hurts. Something is wrong with the world. You took my song. You took my song away.*

I looked at my bloodied hands, young and old and strong and weak all at the same time.

Then I leapt out the window.

I saw four state soldiers on the nearest roof. They turned around when I emerged, shocked.

And then they died.

More. I needed more. I needed something else. There. The helicopter that dropped us off turned. It had noticed me. Without stopping to ask why I’d betrayed them, it turned, and a gunman leaned out one side of the helicopter. Terribly accurate bullets rained down on me, and no power on earth could have dodged them.

So I shot them out of the air.

Then I shot him.

The helicopter crashed with a terrible *crunch.*

That was all it took to attract my siblings’ attention. My brothers and sisters clambered over the edges of the roof, staring at me in shock.

One of them opened his mouth to ask, “Siste—”

I screamed. Primal, raw, ululating, I cried out in language incomprehensible, universal, pure.

My siblings took a step back. They searched me, nimble minds questing out for an answer. An answer they’d always had, really. We were the Young, and we trusted each other.

As one, silently at first, then with a growing, furious growl, we fanned out across the city, to strike back against the state.

The soldiers noticed our approach, but it didn’t save them. Men, women, machines—nothing could stand up to the tide of the Young. I could feel my bones weakening, my skin flaking off my body, but I didn’t care. For once in my life, I was free.

And as if brought on by that thought, as I sprinted across a bombed-out parking lot, I choked, mouth finding nothing but air as I felt a terrible, familiar feeling. All around me, the Young collapsed, like wheat before the farmer’s scythe. 

I looked down. My feeding tube had been deactivated.

Immediately, a horrible, writhing hunger screamed through me, my body burning away my fat and muscles and skin and bones to fuel an impossible metabolism. I was withering.

But still I stood.

A gruesome smile split my lips as I lurched forwards, even as I wasted away. The state soldiers took one look at my face and blanched. One foolhardy soldier raised her gun to fire at me.

I walked forwards, unafraid. It didn’t even matter; I was already dead. I opened my mouth to say:

“A is for *atrocity*, atrocities we bring. With the last of my breath and my voice, I *sing.*”

I laughed maniacally in the empty city as my body tore itself apart.

&amp;nbsp;

""Your Honor, I'd like to call my next witness to the stand,"" I said, my arms folded over my chest.

The judge nodded. I turned to the jury for dramatic effect as I called out for the witness. ""The claimant's side calls Medusa to the stand.""

The eyes of the jury widened, then immediately dropped. Everyone in the room averted their gaze as the doors to the courtroom opened behind the audience. In strode Medusa, her eyes hidden under mirrored sunglasses and the snakes of her hair wriggling under a headscarf. Another scarf around her neck covered the lower half of her face; barely any of her scaled skin could be seen at all. She walked across the room to the stand and sat down, delicately placing her hands in her lap.

I glanced around at the room; no one dared look up at the Gorgon. ""It's alright,"" I began, ""you can look up. Her eyes are hidden; she can't turn you to stone.""

One by one and slowly, people around the room looked up at Medusa. The first glances were quick, almost as if they believed that just a flash wouldn't cause her powers to activate in case I'd been lying. But after a few double-takes, the audience and the jury rested their eyes firmly on her, poring over her appearance. I understood their curiosity; I had been the same way when she came into my office that first day. But she herself seemed unbothered by their stares. She knew her novelty, her danger.

The judge was the last to turn to the Gorgon. He glanced at her, then flicked his gaze to me. ""You may proceed, Whitley.""

I gave a quick nod, then looked at Medusa for a few silent moments, trying to ease whatever nerves she might have had at speaking. We'd gone over this a million times. No surprises were to be had on my end, but we were about to go into some dense territory. I sent up an unspoken prayer to the goddess Victoria that she might allow Medusa to triumph over her fears. We were going to need it.

""Medusa,"" I began, ""where were you on the third night of the seventh month, three years ago?""

She swallowed. ""I was in the temple of Minerva, bringing an offering for me and my sisters. It was our tradition that one of us would go every year to bring our offering. That year, it was my turn.""

I nodded, turning away from her. I began to pace the room, going between her, the jury, and *The Forum's* defense attorney. 

I continued my questioning. ""And was there anyone there with you when you entered into the temple?""

""No sir,"" Medusa answered. ""I went at night so that no one would see me. I didn't want to be hindered in trying to give the offering.""

""And in what way would you have been hindered?""

""Well…"" she trailed off. ""My former appearance attracted a lot of attention. I didn't want anyone to try and slow me down or stop me. I just wanted to leave the offering and then depart.""

I walked to my table nearby and picked up the magazine on it. Bringing it forward to the judge, I held it aloft so that everyone could see it as well. ""I'd like to submit this evidence for examination, Your Honor. It's a copy of *The Forum* from four years ago, and on the cover: Medusa.""

A ripple of murmurs spread across the jury. On the cover of that issue was the picture of a beautiful girl with flowing, black ringlets and piercing green eyes. Her skin was porcelain-white, unblemished and untainted by the greenish-yellow scales that now littered her flesh. She was dressed in a purple toga that was tied at the waist with a golden cord.

I held up the cover to Medusa. ""Can you read that headline along the right-hand side for me, please?""

She stiffened for a moment, but regained her composure. She cleared her throat. ""Medusa shares her tips and tricks for Venus-approved locks,"" she read out.

""Medusa,"" I repeated. ""So this *is* a picture of you?""

She nodded. I handed the magazine to the judge; he looked over it and nodded. I took that as my signal to continue questioning.

""So you were alone in the temple,"" I said. ""Did you remain alone the entire time you were there?""

""No.""

""Who did you see while you were there?""

She hesitated, and I could see her lip quivering. She pursed them and took a deep breath. ""Neptune,"" she replied.

I inhaled. Now we were getting to the hard part. ""Did he speak to you while you were there?""

""Yes.""

""Can you give me a run-down of the conversation?""

""He said hello and asked what I was doing in the temple. I told him that I was bringing an offering from my family; he then asked if my family came with me. I told him no, and he then started telling me how much prettier I was than my sisters. I thanked him, of course, and tried to continue my offering, but he… he wouldn't leave me alone.""

I glanced at the jury. ""And what do you mean by not leaving you alone?""

""He kept trying to interrupt my offering. He would ask me questions about how many suitors I had or if I was betrothed yet. Or…"" her voice faded.

""Or what?""

""Or if I'd been with a man yet,"" she whispered, looking down at her hands.

I turned around and started walking again, this time drawing near to the jury. Their eyes flickered among themselves, glancing at one another in what appeared to be confusion. *Good,* I thought. *We're on the right track.*

Leaning against the railing separating the jury from the floor, I looked back at Medusa. ""In what manner did you respond to these questions? Did you answer them at all?""

""I answered whatever questions he asked,"" she said. ""I wanted to be respectful; he was a god and I was in his sister's temple. I didn't want to make him angry, but… he was beginning to make me uncomfortable.""

""Uncomfortable?""

""Yes, I didn't understand why he kept asking those questions. They were… odd, to say the least. And they kept getting more and more personal.""

I nodded and crossed the floor again, stopping in front of the Gorgon. ""And then what happened?"" I asked.

""He… he grabbed me. He told me I was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen - more beautiful than even Salacia, his wife. He told me he had been in love with me since the first time he'd seen me.""

""When was that?""

""I'm not sure for him,"" she replied. ""The first time I remember seeing *him* was at the Neptunalia five years ago. My sisters and I had given him gifts of pearl and polished shells.""

I nodded. ""And how did you react to this confession?""

""I was flattered, surely, to be complimented in such a way by a god… But he was married to another, and I was still a maid. And of course, we were in Minerva's temple. It would have been the highest form of disrespect to profane her holy place, as she is a virgin goddess herself.""

Medusa bit her lip, then continued: ""So I told him that I was appreciative of his words, but that I had to excuse myself and get home before my sisters began to worry.""

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. ""How did Neptune react?""

Medusa was silent. I looked at her - the whole room did. A lone tear slipped out from under her sunglasses and slid down her face, running along the spaces between her scales. She wet her lips and opened her mouth to answer, her breath coming out in shudders.

""He… forced himself on me.""

A quiet gasp echoed through the room. I turned to the jury; their eyes were wide and different emotions flashed in each of their faces: anger, pity, surprise.

I pressed forward in my questioning. ""And after the act, what happened?""

More tears had begun to flow down Medusa's face. ""He left,"" she managed between gasps. ""Then Minerva found me. I don't remember exactly what happened, it was all a blur, but… I remember hearing her yelling at me. Something about being a harlot in her house. And then everything started to go dark and it felt like my head was being cleaved in two. I think I passed out, but I don't know for how long. When I woke up, I was like this."" She gestured towards her head.

I could hear the jury whispering nearby; I ventured a glance to see if they were turning sympathetic to my client. They were exchanging glances amongst themselves, particularly the women. A few were leaned close to their neighbor’s ear, the neighbor’s brow furrowed in thought. Throughout the bench, most seemed perturbed at the story they’d just heard, but others remained unfazed. I sighed inwardly. *Can’t win ‘em all over, I guess.*

""I tried to go back home,"" Medusa continued, but when I woke up, it was morning and the temple was beginning to be filled. People saw me and screamed, then all of a sudden they were turned into stone. Every single person who looked into my eyes - stone.""

""And that's when the reports started going out,"" I said, walking again to my table. I picked up another copy of *The Forum* and brought it to Medusa. On the cover was a photo of a stone figure, their face twisted in horror. ""What does the headline say?""

Medusa wiped the tears from her face. ""The Mediterranean's most beautiful girl turns into its most terrifying murderer,"" she read.

I handed the magazine to the judge, then turned to Medusa. ""Now you just got out of another trial a few months ago, didn't you?""

She nodded and I continued. ""What was the trial on?""

""On the deaths of the 'heroes' that came after me once my… new state had been made public.""

""And how did the court find you?"" I asked.

""Not guilty of murder,"" she said. ""They decided that I acted in self-defense.""

""Self-defense indeed,"" I echoed. ""Now, we aren't going to argue that case again, but what I do want to know is this: who was the first news outlet to break that you'd been turned into a 'monster?'""

She glanced at the defense attorney. ""*The Forum* did,"" she said.

""Yes, they were the first by twelve hours."" I glanced at the jury. ""And it can be logically assumed that the other outlets got their ideas *from* the article put out by *The Forum.* Which in turn led to more articles on the terrifying and murderous Medusa.""

I turned back towards Medusa. ""And what happened after the news broke, ma'am?""

""They cast me out of the city. I had to live in a cave by the cliffs. And they… they sent people after me to kill me, like I was some sort of trophy to be had. But I wasn't doing anything to anyone. I just wanted to be alone.""

""So these articles that were put out, principally by *The Forum,* resulted in the endangerment of your life?"" I asked.

""Yes sir,"" she replied softly.

I looked once more at the jury. ""Well then,"" I began, ""that sounds like defamation if I ever heard it.""

They stared at me, their face all telling a different story. But there was one thing of which I was certain, they believed us.

I turned to the judge and smiled. ""Your Honor, the claimant's side rests.""

fojrco,Cody_Fox23,[MODPOST] 20/20 Contest Announcement,"#Good Morning Promptians!

&amp;nbsp;

You've been asking for it, and it's been building in the background. Now seems like a great time to make this announcement.

&amp;nbsp;

[Drumroll please...](https://media.giphy.com/media/u0YhXjoPxl0Pu/giphy.gif)

&amp;nbsp;

We are launching a **[new contest](https://media.giphy.com/media/y8Mz1yj13s3kI/giphy.gif)**! 

I guess the title gave that away though, huh?

Oh well! 

Anyhow, **The 20/20 Contest** will be structured differently than other contests that have taken place here before. It is my hope that it will be exciting and fun for all who enter!

&amp;nbsp;

######**Let me break it down for you:**

* **Who**: Anyone that wants to compete for that sweet flair, bragging writes, Reddit Gold, a secret prize, and immortality in the [rWP Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/contest_winners).

* **What**: Image Prompts are the central focus to this contest. That's right, in 2020 we're going to make sure you have that 20/20 vision! 

* **When**: I'll put a complete timeline below, but there are two weeks for signups. Round 1 Challenges will go live [April 8th](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/to?msg=20/20%20Challenge%20Start&amp;p0=250&amp;ud=1&amp;year=2020&amp;month=4&amp;day=8&amp;hour=0&amp;min=0sec=0fromtheme=generic).

* **Where**: Here of course!

* **Why**: Contests are fun, and we could use a fun distraction. In addition I personally want to see IPs get more love, and I hope this contest will help people see how fun and interesting it is to write for them!

* **How**: The 20/20 contest is a three round competition. Each round will require participants to write a new story for a new image. If you go all the way, you'll have written three stories!

 In each round users will be randomly placed into heats. The top two of each heat will move into the next round. Then the top two of those move into the final round.

 How many people are in a heat will depend on total entrants of course. For the sake of example let's assume 54 Promptians participate! We start with 9 heats of 6 Promptians. The top two seed the 3 heats of 6, and the top two of those make the final heat of 6 for the grand prize! We can scale this to fit any number of participants, but that means some heats will be slightly larger than others.

 It's pretty simple right?

&amp;nbsp;

#####I hope you are getting excited by now! 

&amp;nbsp;

Besides the three round structure there is another difference to this contest:

### **Anonymous submission and voting**

That's right. No one's name will be attached to their work until a round has closed. 


&amp;nbsp;

######**Here are the rules for submissions and voting:**

1. When your story is as polished as you think it can be, you will submit it via Google Form. Unlike previous contests you may **not** post it to the subreddit, discord, personal sub, or anywhere else that can allow it to be identified as your story. 

 **FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS RULE WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFICATION!**

2. After stories are submitted they will be randomized and placed, along with the picture that was the seed for the authors, in a ""For Your Consideration"" document that will simply have Story One, Two, Three, etc. 

 You will have a week to read, evaluate, and rank them. Voters will be given a unique ID with which to vote via Google Form to place their top three stories. This will keep multiple votes and fraudulent votes from messing with the results.

 A first place vote is 3 pts, 2nd is 2 pts, and 3rd place is 1 pt. In the case of a tie, the submission with more 1st place votes will take the lead. In the case of a continued tie a secret moderator will cast the tie breaking vote. 

 Also, as long as you submit a story in Round 1, you will be eligible to vote in all rounds! Win or lose you get to help decide who the number one writer is!

3. After the results for a round are announced, the moratorium on posting is lifted. You will be able to submit it as a [PI] to the sub, post to your personal sub, or anywhere else you desire. It is your work after all!

&amp;nbsp;


######**Timeline:**

* 25 Mar: Announcement, and sign ups go live
* 08 Apr: First Round Write begins
* 15 Apr: First Round Vote begins
* 22 Apr: Results Announced / First round entries cleared to post

'Cause I'm ready to go!

&amp;nbsp;

foiibw,ecstaticandinsatiate,[OT] Teaching Tuesday: Pacing Workshop (Part 1),"Hello friends! Welcome back to Teaching Tuesday :) This is our first-ever workshop post, so it’s a bit of an experiment all-around. Thank you to everyone who submitted pieces and made this post possible!

I’m going to make this at least 2 weeks of workshopping so that I can make sure that everyone who already critiqued people in the first week gets their turn being workshopped. I'm open to making this 3 weeks of workshopping depending on demand.

So this week we are looking at pieces from:

- /u/errorwrites
- /u/Lilwa_Dexel
- /u/Shuflearn
- /u/Tim-the-elf
- /u/pegaswhite

Next week we will look at pieces from:

- /u/mobaisle_writing
- /u/CodeScramble
- ...and hopefully more of you! ;)

If you want to be on that list for next week and you’re not already, go back to the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fkcoa7/ot_teaching_tuesday_pacing/) and leave some crit for your fellow workshoppers! :) The biggest benefit of a workshop really comes from analyzing other people’s work and using it as an opportunity to practice critiquing. So that’s my goal with that particular requirement to make it on the list. &lt;3

**No new workshop submissions are accepted at this time; people who have already submitted may go back and crit others, though.**

Alright, without further ado, let’s crack these pieces open and dig into it!

##How Does Workshopping… Work?

So, the first part of this post, I'd like to address some brainstorming thoughts/questions some of you posed in last week's post. :) Then, after that, I want to go over the workshop pieces one by one to look at what's working and what could be strengthened.

My goal here is to look at the points we reviewed in the original article, which were:

1) Polysyndeton and/or asyndeton (self-quiz: “poly” means many and “a” means none … remember what kind of words you can have many or none of based on that?)

2) Description to convey time

3) Sentence and paragraph length

4) Character action and reaction

We're going to experiment with putting the *full* text of the workshop piece into this post. I have the hope that will make it easier to read the feedback without clicking between windows too much :)

##Brainstorming Responses

So, last week I posed a brainstorming question and some people responded to it. I ~~got way behind on replying to things in my inbox~~ STRATEGICALLY decided to answer them in this post to make them a group discussion. Definitely not a result of my disorganization. [Nope, never.](https://media.giphy.com/media/l358tNRyzBQZnmHehL/giphy.gif)

/u/ErrorWrites put forward a really good question on how to apply this concept:

&gt; Is there also a pacing for the plot/story, or is that called something else? For me, book or a film can sometimes have wonderful prose or scenes but the story can feel long or dragged-out. Would that be categorized as a problem with pacing?

My post mostly addressed it on the micro, sentence-by-sentence level by looking at **narrative flow**. But you're right that pacing can also describe the **story structure**. Pacing on the micro level looks at how each sentence within a scene contributes to the tone, rhythm, and narrative flow. Whereas pacing on the macro level looks at how each scene works together to create the full impact of the story.

I think very often, pacing on the macro level depends on character action and reaction working together symbiotically. Too much of either can make the piece either feel rushed and scattered (too much action without time for the characters (and the audience, for that matter) to react and process the plot information) or waaaay too damn slow (too much reaction without action carrying the narrative actively forward). A heaping helping of reaction without direct narrative action can create that boring effect of *wow these people have been standing here for 5000 words talking about what they could do instead of actually doing it.*

/u/Errorwrites also went into the magic of conjuring emotionality via pacing, especially in movies. He tackles the question: ""*How in the world can they make me feel this way on command?*"" I think his thoughts on it are cogent and helpful, so I'm linking them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fkcoa7/ot_teaching_tuesday_pacing/fl23oqv/) for anyone who wants to read further :)

/u/-Anyar- also made a really good point about the benefits of those moments to pause: they are hidden opportunities to give observational details and deepen the reader's experience of the world of the story:

&gt; Something I thought about during the brainstorm. When there's an extended pause like with the rain scene, you start noticing details you wouldn't normally recognize. Like the sound of the rain, the card sticking out of one character's pocket, or the car that's been parked near them the whole time. I'm not sure what the effect of that is (foreshadowing? building atmosphere?) but I'm sure it does something significant...

I totally agree! I think you're right to point out it can be conducive to both foreshadowing and atmosphere. To be honest, you could use those details for almost *anything* your heart desires: deepening character relationships, building an individual character, setting up a red herring, increasing/decreasing the tension... Great chance to add some depth to the scene

##Before We Begin

Attention workshoppers: suggested edits will be in *italics* while example sentences I want to highlight will be in **bold**. This way I can still point out very minor grammatical things without taking the extra time/words to explain them :)

**As Yourself As You Read:** What pace does the piece immediately set for you? Does it seem to match what you would expect from the scene?

Remember, the pacing doesn't always have to perfectly match the scene; sometimes a sloooow moment in an intense chase can be exactly the dramatic effect you need. Discordance and the unexpected are our friends here!

##Errorwrites's Piece

&gt; Police sirens blared outside the bank. Red and blue lights flashed through the windows. Inside, a crowd lay face down on the ground and kept their *mouths* shut while a couple *(add minor setting context of where they are in relation to the hostages)* argued.
&gt;
&gt; Davis said, “There’s not much else we can do.”
&gt;
&gt; **“There has to be.” Jane’s voice quivered but her gun stayed firm and pointing at the hostages.** [Example 1]
&gt;
&gt; “There isn’t.” He took out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it up and took a drag. “It’s over.”
&gt;
&gt; **Jane’s eyes darted around the building when they locked on to the hostages in front of her.**
&gt;
&gt; **“Of course,” she said. “It’s obvious.”** [Example 3]
&gt;
&gt; “Don’t...”
&gt;
&gt; “We kill one to show we’re serious.” Her gun pointed at an elderly man.
&gt;
&gt; “No, it’s-”
&gt;
&gt; “Right, a young woman would make a bigger impact.”
&gt;
&gt; Whimpers erupted. **The targeted woman crawled behind a man, who shielded her with his body.** [Example 2] *(Static note: I'd suggest a new paragraph here, as the actor is switching from the hostages and back to Jane with the gun)* The gun hovered on them both. “Two would make a better point.”
&gt;
&gt; “No, are you -”
&gt;
&gt; “We will be in control during negotiation.”
&gt;
&gt; “Jane, listen -”
&gt;
&gt; “They will let us go. Plus we get to kill some rich bas-”
&gt;
&gt; Davis put his cigarette in front of Jane. *A/the trail* of smoke swirled into the ceiling and disappeared. “It won’t work.”
&gt;
&gt; “How do you know if you don’t try?” Jane asked.
&gt;
&gt; More cars screeched to a halt outside.
&gt;
&gt; The dark circles under Davis’ eyes stood out under the bank light. “You’re acting like I’ve never tried before.”
&gt;
&gt; Footsteps thundered closer.
&gt;
&gt; Jane took the cigarette from Davis and inhaled the last of it.

**What's working well:**   
You'll notice throughout that the scene makes use of frequent paragraph breaks in order to stretch out this moment in time and establish the stakes and tension for us. This is a good tool to use, especially in moments of high tension where every character action and reaction could drastically change the course of events.

**Example 1:** Here the piece combines some cool rhetoric (polysyndeton, namely) and scene description to make a quick clipped sentence that simultaneously establishes scene description, tension, stakes (the so what of the scene, the thing that makes us care), and character for Jane. Really good, concise work in that particular sentence

**Example 2:** This sentence does a good job establishing the crowd's reaction to the action of the robbers. It also builds our investment in these characters by seeing one of them act as more than just a bystander by trying to shield another hostage with his body.

**What could be improved:**  
In general, this scene could use a bit more time between moments of action to show us the deliberation between the robbers. Though it seems counter-intuitive, slowing down in a high-stakes situation like this can actually increase the tension, as it really draws attention to the weight of that choice. See this example:

**Example 3:** Here Jane makes two choices, back-to-back, which dramatically increase the tension of the moment. Slowing for just a moment to give an idea of what *reaction*, internally or externally, triggers the action of choosing to kill a hostage will show us Jane's processing. That would accomplish a number of effects, particularly characterizing Jane and deepening the stakes for the hostages.

##Lilwa_Dexel's Piece

&gt; Through my window, pale and bright. Moonlight, starlight split the night.
&gt;
&gt; One rhyme from a frozen mind. To capture the fall of the tide. The world's spin. Life's relentless passing.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;""There's not much else we can do.""
&gt;
&gt; Davis — that's his name — the man on TV. Voice: faceless. Tone: color-blind. Nothing to see. Nothing to do.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;""There has to be.""
&gt;
&gt; Scarlet, the co-star: a starry-eyed starlet, staring defiantly at the ebb of life. Spitting naively into the wind. Lips full and cheeks red. Safe, she thinks, from the hourglass of time.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;""There isn't.""
&gt;
&gt; There isn't!
&gt;
&gt; The proof is in my teary ice. *(Static note: eyes?)* My rusty nails. My broken art. 
&gt;
&gt; &gt;""How do you know if you don't try?""
&gt;
&gt; **Fuck you, Scarlet on your steed. I'll kick your soapbox, make you bleed.**
&gt;
&gt;** Also, bitch, you made me rhyme. One's too many, two's a crime.** [Example 1]
&gt;
&gt; &gt;""You're acting like I've never tried before.""
&gt;
&gt; Listen to D. and let me be. I have tried, don't you see?
&gt;
&gt; Let my sands of time run low. Let me watch the silver glow.
&gt;
&gt; Through my window, pale and bright. Moonlight, starlight split the night.

**What’s working well:**   
This piece makes great use of what we call **form** vs. **content**. Form is how you choose to tell the story: word choice, line breaks, narrative structure, poetic form, etc. Content is what the story is about. The story does a brilliant job balancing the tension between its form—a sort of sing-songy, pseudo-narrative-poem—and the unexpected, bitter grit of its content. 

The frequent use of line breaks coupled with short, sharp fragmented sentences that build up that form (the rhymy poetic bit) really underline the intensity of the content (the narrator’s emotional reaction), creating a strong sense of forward movement. All of which builds up the pace for us really cleanly. See [Example 1] for how the piece uses its form (the sentences and line breaks) to establish that pacing. 

**What could be improved:**   
My main feedback from this piece is less angled at it from a pacing perspective, but rather giving us a more concrete understanding of the narrator’s relationship to the characters on the screen. I get the image of a bitter has-been or could-have-been actor or artist furious that a soap opera star has everything they never achieved. But I think that connection could be slightly clearer. 

The pacing is highly effective for the unconventional form, however. 

##Shuflearn's Piece

&gt; **The grandfather clock's pendulum ticked off the seconds while the wizards and I gathered around the **deer** corpse at the center of the necratorium.** [Example 1] *(suggested adding deer—or whatever animal it is—because it gives us some necessary scene context)* 
&gt;
&gt; Mage Noelle nudged its shoulder with her toe.
&gt;
&gt; Warlock Boris poked its antlers with his staff.
&gt;
&gt; Demonologist Isla crouched to get a better look at the eyes in its stomach.
&gt;
&gt; Old Archwizard Davis, rubbing the scar on his neck, said, ""There's not much else we can do.""
&gt;
&gt; ""But you promised the spark of life,"" I said. ""There has to be something.""
&gt;
&gt; ""There isn't.""
&gt;
&gt; **The other wizards avoided meeting my eyes. This upset me more than anything else.** [Example 2] 
&gt;
&gt; *Static note: I suggest a new paragraph here, as you’re technically transitioning from the wizards to the narrator as the primary actor)* I raised my voice. ""How do you know if you don't try?""
&gt;
&gt; But the wizards were already leaving.
&gt;
&gt; ""What about my gold?"" I followed after them. ""I want my gold back.""
&gt;
&gt; At the archway, Davis put his hand on my shoulder. ""Let it go.""
&gt;
&gt; ""But who cares if it's evil? I can tame it. How could you know that's not possible?""
&gt;
&gt; He rubbed his scar. ""You're acting like I've never tried before.""
&gt;
&gt; In a cluster of tall hats and dark robes, the wizards moved out into the rain. **I shut the double-doors behind them.**
&gt;
&gt; **They weren't masters of the arcane arts; they were overgrown children playing with tools they didn't understand.** [Example 3] If they weren't prepared to try, then it was down to me.
&gt;
&gt; And who knew? After I figured things out, maybe my creation could pay them a visit. It could show them a thing or two about evil.

**What’s working well:**   
**Example 1**: The first sentence does an excellent job setting the pace of the scene and describing the setting simultaneously. We get a clear image of the scene. The sensory description of the clock ticking both establishes a sense of time and tells us just how silent and tense this moment is. Really good use of description to establish pace

**Example 2**: This is an effective moment of action (the wizards’ lack of response) leading to a character reaction (the narrator’s anger). It clearly establishes for us the domino-fall of events that are about to cause the rest of the scene to unfold. Keeps the action logical and character-driven.

**What could be improved:**   
The first five sentences of this piece do a good job using frequent paragraph breaks to *show* us the passage of time and the tension in the room. You can feel the uncertainty and regret between the characters as all of them avoid speaking before Archwizard Davis breaks the silence. However, I’d add a bit of reaction from them—perhaps sharing a wordless glance?—that indicates that this reaction *directly* led to a new action: the choice to do nothing. 

**Example 3**: Here we see the narrator moving from reaction (anger with the injustice of the wizards) to action (deciding to take his revenge). I think we need to see more clearly what specific sparks ignites that particular action. This is a good place to add scene detail—perhaps reckoning back to the ticking clock or looking at the corpse of the animal—to give us a particular moment that triggers the choice for the character. This will make the pace of that moment stronger by allowing us to see the thought process of the character unfold in real time. There is also the nice byproduct of building character in the process. 

##Tim-the-elf's Piece

&gt; **A deafening bang reverberated through the compound. It was too late. We’d run out of time.** [Example 2] Troops would be pouring into the base any second now.
&gt;
&gt; Davis looked at the dust falling from the concrete ceilings. “I’m sorry, there’s not much else we can do for him.”  
&gt;
&gt; I shook my head, disbelief filling my chest. “That’s impossible… there has to be…” I turned to Davis with my eyes full to bursting. “If I found out there was even *one thing* that-”  
&gt;
&gt; I was cut off by another much closer blast tearing through the base. *(Static note: I’d suggest reordering this into active voice: “Another, much closer blast tore through the base, cutting me off.”)*
&gt;
&gt; **The dust falling from the ceiling turned into small bits of rubble falling as Davis raised his voice so I could hear,** [Example 1] “There isn’t. Even if there were, it wouldn’t do any good at this point!” He sadly glanced at the motionless body of our friend- our General- laying dead on the operating table.  
&gt;
&gt; I grabbed the stout man by his coat and pulled him towards me.  “HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU DON’T TRY?”
&gt;
&gt; Davis sighed, removing my hands from his jacket before looking back towards the General. “You say that like I’ve never tried before. Believe me. It’s over.” With that, the medic quickly moved towards the body and picked it up. Terrifying noises of gunfire and death echoed down the hall.
&gt;
&gt; “Leave here, Tim. No one can know what happened here. The idea of the General can’t die here. The people need a symbol of hope. Go. I’ll take care of the body.”
 
**What’s working well:** 
This is a high-stakes, high-tension moment where we see a brief moment of pause in a tumultuous battle. The piece uses semi-frequently line breaks to and well-timed sensory details (see Example 1) to slow down the pace here where we need it: this character interaction that establishes stakes, conflict, and how the characters are going to react to move the scene forward. 

**Example 1**: This description nicely illustrates setting while increasing stakes by showing the battle threatening to literally cave in on them. This is an effective way to create a bubble of calm that the audience knows will pop any second now — which is how you maintain slower pace but high tension.

**What could be improved:**   
**Example 2**: The opening paragraph indicates that action is leading to reaction, but we lose some of the punch of it because we don’t get to directly see the reaction from the characters. I think slowing down to show the process of that realization in real-time will improve the pace by 1) showing us the process of realization with the characters and 2) slowing down the realization just a hair so that we can fully process the emotional stakes hitting the narrator as a direct reaction to the action (the bomb going off) established in the opening line. 

##Pegaswhite's Piece

&gt; Davis, whose small shirt hung off his body, flapping in the wind, said, “There’s not much else we can do.”
&gt;
&gt; Monica’s eyes darted back and forth, scanning the lot for any prying *eyes.* “There has to be.”
&gt;
&gt; “There isn’t,” Davis replied. **He followed Monica’s lips as her head turned. They were small, bright red, luscious. He suddenly worried that Monica might be able to hear the drumming of his heart.** [Example 1]
&gt;
&gt; “How do you know if you don’t try?” Monica said, reaching her hand out to touch Davis’s long fingers. His arm bent awkwardly as his elbow bumped against the back of the concrete wall.
&gt;
&gt; “You’re acting like I’ve never tried before!” Davis’s hand *instinctively* pulled from Monica’s.
&gt;
&gt; “Have you? Tried before?” Monica looked into Davis’s eyes.
&gt;
&gt; “What? Of course, I have, I-I’ve tried a lot. There’s not much to it,” Davis blushed and ~~and~~ tried to avoid Monica’s eyes.
&gt;
&gt; “Then why don’t you show me?” **Monica lifted Davis’s head with a single finger and stepped into his chest, leaning herself into his thin frame. Davis pushed himself against the wall, to give Monica more space. She closed the gap.** [Example 2]
&gt;
&gt; “You just, um, put your lips against mine,” Davis struggled to speak coherently, “Then stick your tongue out. That’s all there is to it. There’s not much more we can do than that.”
&gt;
&gt; Monica drew her lips closer to his and said, “Like this?”
&gt;
&gt; ""Y-ya like that,” Davis whispered and pushed his lips against hers.

**What’s working well:**   
This piece captures a moment of time for these characters: that awkward and delightful rush of could-bes and should-wes right before a first kiss. The first half of the scene does an effective job showing the tug-and-pull teasing of Monica edging closer and closer to Davis, trying to get him to admit he wants to kiss her. 

**Example 1**: This is a really nice description of character action leading to reaction—all from the same character. The action of looking at Monica’s lips causes Davis’s reaction of getting all flustered and embarrassed. This sentence in particular: “They were small, bright red, luscious” uses sensory description and rhetoric (asyndeton) to establish what effect those lips have on Davis by illustrating for us the experience of his thought process in real time. 


**What could be improved:**   
This is a general note unrelated to pacing: this is mostly written as third person limited, which is like having a camera situated on the main character’s shoulder. We perceive the scene as Davis does, but it is not as closely in his head as first person, which is more like seeing with Davis’s eyes. However, some of the details in here (like describing how his shirt is hanging or his thin frame) don’t read like they are how Davis would think or perceive himself in that moment. I would keep those narrative lines clear to keep the perspective firmly grounded. 

Sorry, lol, not totally pacing related but I felt it worth mentioning. I do have one little note about pacing, however:

**Example 2**: I would slow this interaction down, as right now those sentences are all action. Monica lifting Davis’s head and stepping closer to him, Davis stepping away. The piece would benefit from slowing here to show the electricity of those movements, allowing Davis to react to the thrill and fear of it all. 

This would show us how Davis is thinking and reacting in the moment, as well as increasing the stakes and tension of that moment just before the kiss comes. With romance, pacing those last few seconds before the kiss finally happens can be the most important part in terms of establishing tension, stakes, and character.

You’ll notice that I don’t say “Lilwa did a brilliant job writing X”—even though she did ;)—but rather I phrase it as “the piece did a brilliant job…” This phrasing helps us emotionally separate the writer from the writing, both for the critiquer and the critiquee. Which is invaluable when we start talking about what’s *not* working in a story.

Thank you all again if you made it to the end of this big-ass post. And I do hope it helped!

fnzexd,Character-Comb,[WP] outline for a fictional universe.,"This is an outline for a fictional universe. Any similarity to any real person, living or dead, is purely coincidental. These are fictional characters in a story or simulation, do not attempt. Do not try this at home.

Corrective Envisceration and Embracing The Venture are both part of the universe. Genre is hard science fiction nowpunk. This is not utopian fiction, do not try this at home. The target audience is internet users of adult age that are not, were never, annd never will be the President, and don't know the President. The plot is supposed to go over exactly as futurism says that real life will go over. The only difference from reality is that the ancient Cleopatra and the people she had contact with have never been to ancient Rome nor Egypt. These characters live key parts of their lives around the year CE 2030, an important year in the universe. At best, life is hard, unfair, and short, and one cannot successfully pursue happiness, instead they can only successfully pursue meaning; successful life is stressful and meaningful.

The main narrative locations are California, the Washington D.C. conurbation (mostly Washington DC, Annandale, VA, and Alexandria, VA) and Jerusalem. The United States of America is 'Murica the Boorish, a combative, destructive and high-tech, low culture (Sterling, Bruce. Preface. Burning Chrome, by William Gibson, Harper Collins, 1986, p. xiv.) with an unusually punitive, ill-considered and unproficient legal system, jurisprudence, and foreign policy, mostly off-screen. For example, the United States would use such controversial punishments as corrective envisceration. Corrective envisceration is defined as the entombment alive of one prisoner inside of another convict. The outer convict is usually transformed, with means including CRISPR, into a pinniped at sea. The inner convict would usually be a woman, and the outer convict would usually begin as a man, whom the system would usually know to be her intimate partner before trial outside of the supervision of the system. During the pinnipedification, his penis would usually be relocated so it would be able to penetrate the inner convict after pinnipedification, and his BCI would usually be connected to the inner convict's BCI. Corrective envisceration is a painful procedure for the outer convict, equivalent to childhood growing pains. Appeals are generally useless, since when assistance of counsel is adequate in such appeals, the courts would still generally insist that corrective envisceration is not a cruel and unusual punishment. When a civilian is the defendant, the prosecution usually wins the case in voir dire. When the case is not decided in voir dire, its result is more correlated with physical and psychological factors acting on the plaintiff and defendant and with economic factors acting on the lawyers then on the evidence in the case.

Every technology successfully demonstrated in real life laboratories has been deployed to its full effect. For example, integrated circuits are always made of Feng-Snodgrass transistors. On-screen, the characters are portrayed at their kindest, most advisable moments. The United States favors heavily arming untrustworthy allies, so every weapon soon falls into the wrong hands, including even the smallest and most untrustworthy, inept and remote militia. The use of powerful all-out illegal small arms by even the least powerful street gang is common. Small arms always include mass-produced lethal nanodrones, whether it's only one fired from an underslung launcher or many fired en masse from a truck. The United States, the Russian Federation, and even Iran all mass-produce them. Weapons with even the most basic computerization, such as nanodrones, can always be easily set to fully autonomous, and unlawful setting of the weapon to autonomous and then winding up in prison for it is common. The targeting systems mistakenly fail to follow instructions as intended, and they underperform the top 90% of drone operators. Many of the drone operators are 12 year olds working for far away militias, so their performance is not great. A less common risk in setting the weapons to fully autonomous is futility - the weapon will sometimes fail to understand the point of the commands being given, or classify the commands as being not literally meant or as about to be rescinded, and stand down without permission from their operator.

In the fictional universe, when there is a neighbor that is about to wage war, the rational move in foreign policy is always to make concessions. The concessions are not made because the states are too equal in power, are too lonely and frustrated, (Wikipedia) and their people are inexperienced youth plus persuadable elders. A cycle of revenge breaks out between the polities that make the least concessions, in which 18, 19 year old kids and twenty-somethings burn the settlements, poison the land, and neglect and physically, sexually and verbally abuse prisoners from the other polity, and war crime convicts from their own polity. Combatants are not heroes, they're people from a domestically abusive background, and they don't make enough concessions and don't just stay away from people they don't trust. In short, they are villains. Their motivation is loneliness and frustration, technically known as ""autophobia-athazagoraphobia and uncertainty that one's needs will be met"" (Wikipedia). Afraid of stuff that they can't understand or is not like them, and of being alone, embarrassed, ignored, replaced, or forgotten, their wants are often times the opposite of their wishes, like for example they might want to earn a Purple Heart. For another example, they might wish get attention by a means because it's what bores them. They are all extortionists or working for extortion rackets. State actors are just extortion rackets, nothing less, and nothing more. Evil is toxic. Usually, when conflict happens, both sides are at fault for it in some way, no matter how small the mistake one side committed. The conduct and perceptions of both belligerents are more about their own domestic issues than about their enemy.

The prologue is that the USS Liberty Incident did happen, and was a deliberate attack by Israel against what it knew to be the United States ship. The future president was born in the United States of America. His natural parents and foster parents were all substance users with a physically punitive parenting style. He had an allergy to pollen. In high school, when it was the job of one of his female friends to turn the hood on, she left the hood off in a Biology experiment, and he took the cover off of a jar of pollen too quickly. He and she argued loudly. Later at PE, while high on non-habit-forming sleeping pills they fist fought in the gym. Pursuant to the school's zero tolerance policy, they were both expelled. Both of them had non-abusive relationships with other students in other high schools. The future president got into a heterosexual relationship with a fellow student in which both crushed on the other and they had frequent, dysfunctional, orgasmic and consensual sex. Like their bodies, their anxiety disorder induced arousal disorders were made for each other. The orgasm of both parties was inevitable. One of the few things they got right is that she was using spermicide. At 18 years old, he began his lackluster military career in psychological warfare.

The future first lady was also born in the United States of America, and had an Israeli American mom. Her natural parents and foster parents were all substance users with a physically punitive parenting style. She crushed on a fellow high school student, who had similar parents and crushed on her back. He asked her out on a date, but instead they hung out and went their separate ways. All told, there was no abuse, pregnancy, nor sexual transmission of disease. She researched, made, and carried out a plan to flee while she was still a minor, and vented her break up anger into her studies and her shower heads. He masturbated so much that he bruised his shaft and chaffed his glans penis.

The story starts with the descent of the United States into the First United States - Israel War. (Do not attempt.) The United States fell into a cycle of loneliness and frustration at situations of its own making, such as incorrectly fielded automation with an undereducated population, a loss of soft power at home and abroad, capital flight, and workplace toxicity plus various counterproductive responses, such as more punitive policies at home and abroad, and counterproductive personal behaviors such as substance use, corporal punishment of children in the home and such as intimate partner violence. For example, the President of the United States is an expy of Ptolemy XIII, and the First Lady of the United States is an expy of Cleopatra VII Philopater. Instead of Egypt, there is the United States, and instead of ancient Rome, there's modern Israel.

Unreliable, expensive software products were widespread, and are expies of the corresponding RL products. Schools were lame, and athletic students and intellectual students would often to get into fist fights against each other.

It was clear from start to finish that the President was a first-term lame duck and a domestic abuser, and it was clear that the reason was that the office at the time lacked the incentives required to attract a more qualified candidate due to a transfer of campaign funds and power away from the federal government of the United States. It was immediately clear from the President's propaganda techniques, from whistleblowers, and ultimately from the First Lady's defection. He rose to power on constituents that did not know this, half of which knew this at the end, too late. His election campaign contained IPV red flags. The First Lady however, was completely different from him, she was cunning and would have had potential as a total badass. Her conduct was only contemptible and weak because she had the wrong enemy, whom she had only because she was married to the wrong man. She was a threat, and he was a liability. His acts of conflict had a domestic style, and hers were characteristic of a toxic, postal workmate. He was neurotypical, and though he identified as a man, he was effectively a trans woman, and she was an Asperger's cis-woman. There are multiple real-life complaints on an Asperger's subreddit against intimate partnerships between trans women and Asperger's cis-women. When off hours together, he seemed to want sex and attention from her, and she expressly wanted him to watch hard sf, pet videos, documentaries and infographics on television and to eat Cannabis sativa forma indica with her. Apart, they would cheat on each other, he would be useless at parties, and she would study martial arts. Though he was the HL, he was also the partner with sexual dysfunctions. His aggressive anger was an all-out hasty and sudden loss of cool, and her aggressive anger was settled and deliberate, and she always almost kept control of herself when she did explode. He was Christian Right, and she was centrist-RINO or moderate, secular Republican and apolitical moderate agnostic with atheist tendencies. There were several other issues in their relationship, all stemming from the simple fact that this was the wrong person for them to know. Both had prior intimate partnerships that were more or less faithful and non-abusive, and afterwards she had a non toxic marriage with no physical nor sexual abuse, and no transmission of STDs. The only ways in which the two were similar is that they were both humans of about the same age, their parents and foster parents were all substance users with a physically punitive parenting style, they were both combative and destructive, they both spoke English to the bewilderment of others, they were both more or less heterosexual with abortive but non-abusive sexual relationships with other people, they both rode in the car, they both lived in the United States at one time, they both directed attention to Israel, and they were both occasional drinkers. Even riding in the car was an issue, because she would often grab the door frame when getting into a car, and he would often slam the door. With his prior intimate partner, the President would show his intimate partner into the car, she would enter quickly and decisively, and then he would turn around and slam the door shut. With her other intimate partners, she would enter slowly and awkwardly, grabbing the door frame, and her intimate partners would look at the door while carefully shutting the door. This proved especially problematic when he was showing her out to the car during a drunken shouting match that started at the Correspondent's Dinner. She then sprung up out of the car and waylaid him. The media called it a slap, but it's clear from photos that as he faced away from the car, her fingers were injured and she clotheslined him in the back of the neck using her forearm and her extensive martial arts training. The Secret Service's morale was at a 100-year low, and they were tardy in arresting her. She defected to Israel soon after, as a waypoint to get to the Hague in the Netherlands to file for divorce. The United States and Israel attacked each other's cities using nuclear-tipped SLBMs, destroying Jerusalem, Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and the Washington D.C. conurbation. She returned or was returned to the President in the Netherlands, and she took or was put on Abilify. They both passionately attempted to have sex with each other in that hotel just outside the Hague, as wet and dry, on Abilify and not, they shared an powerful emotional bond. Afterwards, the President was ""drunkardized,"" and she was high on Abilify when a shouting match erupted and she fired three times and thereby shot the President twice in the chest with a handgun. This makes sense because the third shot missed or bounced off. This revealed his position to a hidden rifleman, who shot him in the chest, missing the heart. The President died in the hospital of wounds within 24 hours. The rifleman disappeared without trace, leaving open the possibility that he died of natural causes at his time. The First Lady initially escaped arrest and punishment because of the chaos of the war.

The remaining allies of the United States noted that Israel was a former United States ally, and that the First Lady defected and was far more cunning then the President. They broke off the alliances. The United States was left without allies abroad. Neither the United States nor Israel continued as a political, military, nor economic power. What was left of a political or military power in the world was Europe and the United Kingdom. The First Lady was arrested and tried, and sentenced to 364 days in sub-minimum security prison. Then that the President was dead, she served her sentence, and no more. And on the outside, she had a non toxic marriage with another man, who was a long time friend that she married after 5 years of dating. They and the First Children all died without much money in their sleep at their time of natural causes in old age.

The 2nd United States Israel War erupted, and both sides took hits from each other's nuclear weapons. By this time Sacramento was well and truly a lake. After the Second United States Israel war, the United States plagiarized Article 9 to the Japanese Constitution, passing an amendment to the United States Constitution officially abolishing the United States military and creating in its place a United States Self-Defense Force. It was treated as bad form to refer to the United States Self Defense Force as a military. The United States made into statute a schedule to decommission and dismantle the remaining nuclear weapons, and though it fell behind the schedule in doing so, this was ultimately complete. Then, the United States of America and Israel disbanded. Afterwards, wars would include nanoweapons armed with nanodectonics.

fnywu8,BABaracusX,"[SP] Jack, is a man with a past","***I'm new to writing, this is a charter I would want to mold a story around. Feedback would be very helpful, thanks****

Jack is a man with a past he cannot escape. A fall from grace that exploded like a Meteor striking the earth, and everybody saw the impact. What everybody saw was only the surface of the destruction.

In the days and years after all happened he would spend his days sitting at any bar that will have him. The darker the better. The alcohol dulled the pain on the memories, but when his mind got clear again, the memories returned stronger. He still thought about his brothers every day. The crime lord, who gaze would stop the weak dead, and taught me the way of the streets. The hopeless romantic that balanced the needs of the group with the missions at hand. And the old Alpha, who taught him to fight, maybe too well, before he was betrayed and murdered by those he trusted.

Then there was his family. The loss above all others. The blow to his very core that he could not escape from, and will forever be apart of him no matter how far or fast he runs from it.

Bottle after bottle, night after night he began to lose himself to his inner darkness, and began to corrupt the beast within. He became weaker, slower, and lost sight of everything he had built. Those who believed in him tried to steer him from this path, but he pushed them away. Most of those who depended on him were utterly abandoned.

A small portion of his wealth persisted, through no doing of his own. What few friends and surviving former pack-mates he had they saw the downward spiral and took action using the business skills he himself had taught them. They came together to set his affairs, through trusts and investments that were no longer under his control. He would always be able to survive but he was only a shadow of his former self and everybody in Texas saw him as a shell of the “man” he was. No longer to be respected or feared.

The beast inside was grew stronger as he grew weaker. His ability to control his rage faded, and his anger attracted other men of anger. He would lose himself in the alcohol and rage, and prove that his anger, his hurt was worse than those who would dare challenge him. At 1st.

But nothing… I was in the middle of nowhere, locked down to the ground by the weight of my own body constantly keeping me anchored. 
‘’Just chill Gem… Go play some music, cook, relax… Listen to yourself, you are not going crazy, it’s just the time spinning around like usual.’’ - my Body ached to move and with every molecule in my disposal I pushed myself to get to my stereo, pushing one button playing on repeat. I could feel the rhythm of air change with the first note coming from the speakers. The atmosphere shifted and once again I felt like I was in full control of letting my body flow through the words of ‘’Sink into the floor’’. 
Jolts of electric shocks went up and down my body, leaving me with this sensation of being in eternal sync with the smallest cells covering this Earth. One by one, they began to cover my palms and wrists. Marks of intertwined lines, mixed in peach and light purple. Deep breaths have left my body leaving me breathless, odd, with no need for oxygen. I hit the floor, surrendering my soul to the feeling of fulfillment.
I woke up what seemed to be hours later. The Sun was long gone. Outside stretched a dim night sky with small flickers fighting to stay alive. My head weighted a tone. It hit me like the worst hangover. ‘‘Hm, it feels like a day after ‘my’ birthday, I better make myself some refreshments.’’ I tumbled down on my way to the kitchen. Oh God! Won’t you look at that.

fntrvr,batcat_cookie,[WP] They said I might bring that summer again with no end. They said they didn’t want me.,"They said that they didn’t remember. They didn’t remember the day I was born. Lost in harvest, struggling to make just enough to buy food and provide for the family. But they do remember that it was hot. Steaming hot. The harvest that year was poor, barely any crops survived and what had survived was given to the masters. 
They said I was born just before the first roosters sang to announce the day. And since I stepped into this world, they said - they said I was stubborn just like that Sun not giving them a day of rest. Always up, at its peak, showing the beauty even though no one wanted it. It made no place for someone else in that sky, no room for rain or clouds. And that was me. 
I have never understood why, in their eyes, I was something undesirable. When they looked at me, they turned their heads, covered their eyes. They said that my hair was untamable. My lips were too red, my freckles too noisy. And my eyes enchanting. They said that I might bring that summer again with no end. They said they didn’t want me. 
So I left. 
I moved into the city. I remember the first day here like it was yesterday. Lost, tires screeching on asphalt, honks as loud as the roar of the lion. This was a new jungle, the one I wanted to make my home. Standing in the middle of the street, at high noon, my sandals burning under my feet, my gaze on the buildings. It seemed like everyone was running for their dreams. Such chaos I have never yet experienced in my village. But with my own goal, my dream, I ran my fingers through my hair and made my way through the masses. 
My first nights, I spent sleeping on Barabara’s couch. Sweet old lady accompanied by a dog and a cat. With them I had shared my bed and surely enough they were the best roommates. At the dinner table she would tell me stories from her youth. Back in the day when she was still beautiful, her breasts perky and hips that made every guy turn around. Then she would take one of her photographs and point out every detail about her long lost beauty. But in my eyes she was prettier than she had ever been. A vessel filled with adventures, lost loves and a warming heart. But she didn’t want to hear about that. She mourned for the dresses. Long, glittery, figure shaping, ball gawns. You just name it and she had it. A picture of herself in the dress - as a proof. Proof of her glory, with a cigarette between her long skinny fingers and a guy in the back, slobbering in the presence of a queen.",3,1585003769,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fntrvr/wp_they_said_i_might_bring_that_summer_again_with/,WritingPrompts,1

A door opens and I can make out the silhouette of a woman. ""Where?"" is all I can manage to utter as my brain scrambles to process. 

""Andrew, you're in the hospital, your family will be here soon."" 

Hospital? Like a foreign word I've never heard before but suddenly understood. How? The woman stands over me,

""Andrew you've been in a coma for 2 months, but you're awake now, and your family is on the way."" 

""Do I know you?"" I creak. I'm struck with a fear I've never felt. A loss of self. Who's voice am I using? Who am I?

""Well we've never actually met, but my name is Kim. I'm a nurse."" 

I look down at my hand, a hairless twig of an arm greets my vision. 

The door bursts open and another woman appears in the frame. Our eyes meet and its as if a floodgate opens in my brain.

fnmlk3,TenspeedGV,[OT] Spotlight: Susceptive,"##Writers Spotlight
***********

This week's spotlight writer is **Susceptive**

To be honest, I’d only seen Susceptive’s name around once or twice. As much as I try to read all kinds of posts on this sub, sometimes I just can’t make it to all the threads I want. There’s so much content and so little time. As such, I was surprised to get so many nominations for them in such a short span of time. There’s not many writers who get that many nominations that quickly. My interest was piqued.

After reading through the stories in their profile, both on our sub and on other subs, I can say that the nominations are well-earned. I’ve enjoyed all of the stories I’ve come across. I highly recommend you take a look through their profile as well. Maybe we could also convince them to start their own sub to collect their works.

Congratulations, u/Susceptive!

***********

Spotlight relies on your nominations. If you see a writer who has been around the sub for a while, who has at least six (or more!) high quality submissions, and who hasn't been given the Spotlight before, send us a modmail and let us know!

fnhrry,Alexkeith_author,Using prompts at the end of the world.,"I live in SLC and with all the insanity of social distancing and the Earthquake I'm going a little stir crazy so I thought I'd share the little writing project concept I've been working on. 

About 6 months ago I made a goal to based on some advice from Neil Gaiman and some other books. Neil Gaiman told a story about having hundreds of started stories but not that many finished ones in his attic. Offering the advice that finishing bad projects will teach more than starting good projects and not finishing them. Obviously I'm paraphrasing. Then in The Fantasy Fiction Formula by Deborah Chester she broke down written stories by word count thusly.

Novellas: roughly 35,000–50,000 words. Novelettes: 15,000–30,000 words. Short stories: 2,000–10,000 words. Short shorts: 1,500 words or less.

So in the spirit of learning I decided I would write 10 short shorts 7 short stories 5 novelettes And 2 Novellas. 

I was having some difficulty coming up with ideas for each so I decided to take pride out of the equation and use random writing prompts. Specifically I used The Writer's Idea Thesaurus by Fred White, and since I love DND I rolled a dice for the chapter d20, section d10 and situation d10. I did this for all my stories in advanced and wrote the numbers down so whenever I move on to the next attempt theres a new prompt ready and waiting. 

Having no say in the actual prompt has really let me have some fun stretching my creative muscles. The plot is already set. I just have to make it worth reading in my own voice. 

This is my baby steps way to geting more comfortable writing. 24 stories to get me closer to a novel. 

If anyone likes this path and writes with it I'd love to hear their progress!",0,1584959447,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fnhrry/using_prompts_at_the_end_of_the_world/,WritingPrompts,1

fnd4of,CloseToTheWWIII,[WP] BREAKING NEWS: Tell the US people! The coronavirus is designed by US labs," President Trump called the coronavirus as ""Chinese virus"" in his twitter. However, recent proofs show that the virus is indeed an ""American virus"".

Genetic analysis showed that the virus in China and Europe is type 3, while in the early US cases they're types 1 and 2. Strange, right? Don't be surprised. There are something more ridiculous.

Rechard Burr, a US Senator, dumped up to $1.7 million of stock after reassuring public about coronavirus preparedness. He definitely knew that there will be a pandemic in the US. More news showed not only Burr himself, but also several other Senators did the same thing. Obviously, the upcoming widespread of the virus is a consensus among them -- but how did they know that?

They did not get that from China's experience. On the contrary, the fact that the virus is controlled in China delivered a illusion to people in other countries. Just take a look at the Europe. Their leaders, as well as their people, have underestimated the danger, and are suffering from the consequences.

They have the prior knowledge.

Then, look at what the US is doing. It did not relax the sanction on Iran, regardless of the growing deaths there. The US navy is carrying out armed provocation against China in South China Sea. They shipped 800k face masks back from Italy, where the virus is raging. However, taking domestic preventive measures is not a priority.

Iran, China, and even Europe -- what is the common thing among them? That is, they are threatening the US! Iran is seeking for the dominance in the Middle East. China is on the rise and building their third aircraft carrier. Europe, except the UK, is not reliable -- they are always seeking for independence, that is, getting rid of the control of the US. For this, they are cooperating with China. Don't believe that? Just see their attitudes towards Huawei.

The US is seeking for a solution. Their choice is a bioweapon -- the coronavirus. And obviously, the situation outside the US is ideal for them. China sacrificed its economy to stop the virus. Europe and Iran are dealing with their crashing medical systems.

That's the conclusion. The US has the motivation and technology to design such a virus and spread it. And they did it, just like making and spreading the SARS virus.

But -- thanks to the variation of the virus. Good luck to the US. Just wait and see.",1,1584934048,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fnd4of/wp_breaking_news_tell_the_us_people_the/,WritingPrompts,1

- End



What suddenly becomes really important to you? But does any of this make sense?




Inscriptions with no panic, to calm the masses they do say.


A story of fate and meaningful devotion.





- Melancholy part 1






The last two weeks before the war.


The lines in front of the supermarket take their toll on the local population. They aren't used to an sensaison, that some would simply call, well- going mad, to keep it short.




The week before the declaration of emergency. What suddenly becomes really important to you? But does any of this make sense?

Inscriptions with no panic, to calm the masses they say.

""My heart is still pounding, so why can I not stop shaking?"", I simply told to myself.


But the young couple, that get's eyed upon by all the elderly store workers, quite doesn't see the obvious signs of attention for themselves. That is quite ironic in fact, because you can't simply stop an idea- that was already set loose. Likewise plague or virus that you could simply stop. Because ideas can be toxic in fact.




- Melancholy part 2





""So is mine, but we both- like you would do to, if you cared to look around. I simpy can‘t-"" 

""My god. Stop that nonsense already."", the person dimmed in white light said. The shine filled the whole dark wet cell, that they all take shelter in. Thundercracks, beginning to erupt behind the curtain walls.

Cut right in sits our couple from before, hurled up in a small room. With some left over gear, spare clothes and other things. Among them even an old ""adventure skills"" book. That fantasy novel actually provided him with good advice over the last few weeks. Glad I ought to keep it from Lauren all the time. Sometimes she can be annoying, but we both are getting desperate in different ways. I thought to myself, while watching my lighter and flipping it to the side.

""What should stop any of us both from going mad?"" said the womanly figure, crumped up in a field bed, if you can it that. One single pillow and a dirty sock are lying on the bottom of the bed beside her.



A loud crack errupts and splits the clouds wide open for a mild second. A few seconds later, both of them, worringly look towards the window, as a light fills the night. Only to get cut off again. Simply a thunder, nothing to worry about, Lauren. I told her, while holding her fragile body towards her. ""Don't be so melodramatic all the time."", she said. Clearly trying to put sense into his overreactions, that simply can't seem to stop.

""Well, we both know, that you and I are still here together. Even after everything that we got through. Together."" She whispered him into his ears, and kissed him on the cheeks. 

I know, but I would be lost without you, he replied. ""So would I."" She said. The light coming from the moon, that shines through the cells, rests on their shilouette on the bed.

Another thunder. The storm draws closer to the empty remains of a store, they both reside in. The wind starts howling softy between the holes. The broken windows were caused by a similiar destruction. They both, sitting in a shut off room behind the former reception.










End - 2 months since the big breakdown





One is told to calm down, but in the end, what happened in the previous two months that is the reason for this? I was supposed to stay in this facility for another 7 days. So why this and all that trouble in the first place? 





________________________________________________________________________________






""But please- don't loose that light. That's all that's keeping me from going simply mad.""

The figurely person behind the matchstick said.

fn1woq,Cody_Fox23,[CW] Smash 'Em Up Sunday: Sense of Place,"#**Welcome back to Smash ‘Em Up Sunday!**

&amp;nbsp;


##Last Week

&amp;nbsp;

You all never cease to amaze me! I got such good quality responses this week. I never cease to be amazed by the tenacity shown to meet all the constraints and the way these challenges are faced head on. Everyone submitted high quality stories that made judging very difficult! 

I know I say it a lot, but despite my picks, please go back and check out all the stories from last week! There's only nine of them and it's not long to read through them.

&amp;nbsp;

####Cody’s Choices:

&amp;nbsp;

* /u/Xopossum36 - [Soothsayer Savior](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fj2kpa/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_ides_of_march/fko9hy0/)

* /u/-Anyar- - [Birthday Betrayal](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fj2kpa/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_ides_of_march/fktzh47/)

* /u/Zappy_Zippy - [Dinner Disaster](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fj2kpa/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_ides_of_march/fko9hy0/)


&amp;nbsp;

Assist me; I have an alliterative ailment attacking my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

##This Week’s Challenge

&amp;nbsp;

I have a confession to make. I normally outline an entire month of SEUSes in the first week of the month. I have a nice little spreadsheet with all the constraints. 

It's pleasantly organized.

This month though went a bit off-script though. I had 4 authors lined up, but the challenge became a bit too particular. So I made some last minute changes. In addition there is ***something*** I’ve been working on in the background for the subreddit that has been taking some more of my attention.

Then of course, like many of you, readjusting my worklife to the Covid pandemic has been a bit taxing.

That is all to say there is no super cool overarching theme to SEUS this week. However I do have my theme set for next month. I hope you’ll look forward to it with me.

Enough with the apologies! This week is going to be a bit loosey-goosey. Inspired by TT and FF this week we’ll have some familiar themes and styles along with some interesting words and sentences!

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/fmxczc/if_lucifer_was_involved/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

In this universe, God and Lucifer exist, they’ve sectioned themselves off from each other, having half the universe to themselves. 

God in his section has successfully populated the majority of it, but is distant and acts like an authoritative figure to all of them.

While Humans are Lucifers first long-lasting species. So they act very closely with Humanity, basically being their devil-father and generally very doting.

One day, Lucifer decides to barge in on one of Gods meetings and show off his ‘children’

If everyone disappeared and he/she/a person stills there then obviously he/she/the person would need a good doctor [immediately.](https://immediately.so/)

So  I stopped working while thinking something is wrong with my cellphone and went home to post a comment and give the person my honest advice from my pc just to find on my big PC screen that the post is actually achieved.

fmvi4b,userdiedwithjulie,[RF] I let my sadistic psychotic friend stay with me and recover instead of handing him over to the cops or an asylum,"

I met my friend when i was like in grade 4. He was always a troubled child. he argued with the teachers. hurt other kids. tore books, banged benches until he realized he couldn't break them. not one single day passed that he didn't cause a mess. the more we grew more crazier he became. i was not his friend until we were like 10-12 years old.i was 2 years and two grades older, but i did know him.

He once entered the female changing room where i was too , and dragged a girl by hair half naked. no one knew why. both kids' the guardians were called. he never said why he did what he did and was suspended nonetheless. by this time i was his friend, well rather acquaintance. why you ask? because we both were queer and closeted. how we got to know we both were queer is a story for another day.so when i asked him why he did so, his simple reply was, ""it was fun."" and just that. he would behave rudely with almost anyone. well except me. for some reason.

when i got a girlfriend. he got really jealous for a while, saying she was snatching me away from him. no he wasn't obsessed with me. maybe his unconsciousness was scared of loosing the only friend he had. he soon got over being mad at my girlfriends or boyfriends as they changed quiet a few times. he would often come over at my place ( i live alone, mom used to be always out of station and send money, no dad). he would come over. say nothing, cry at my shoulder and then without a word leave. i knew his parents hated him. he was enough crazy outside , i wonder what he was inside the house where his freedom formed more wings. his parents once tried to put him in an asylum but it didn't work out. he voluntarily got out.therapies never worked on him.by the time he was 14 he had assaulted (just beaten up, nothing sexual) countless people our age, dogs, animals. his parents were fed up of him. he hated his older brother, whom his parents obviously focused more on.he never bothered me with any of his crazy antics, yes he was clearly crazy in front of me. but never did the ""crazy deeds"". i mostly ignored all his bullshit rants. and he was just satisfied by screaming bullshit into my ears.the only thing he was good at was studies. academically he was not a problem, but everything else about him was a problem.one day he arrives at my door step. he wasn't on his bicycles, mind you it takes a 30 minute walk from his place to mine.he was covered in bruises and was bleeding from his nose. but he has been hurt like this before but on his own. this clearly looked like someone did this to him.he collapsed on me, i took him to my spare bedroom and rode my way to his house.much to my shock , the fire brigade was there. black smoke everywhere. the tree house in his yard was burned down.when i went to his father he gave me a 'what the fuck do you want ' look.pretending that i don't know anything i asked him where my friend Dan was. "" that little devil is never ever returning here. you better find sane friends. and if you ever see him, say, we're done with him. he ain't our family no more."" without much question i turned around. ' he lit the green tree up huh' is what i thought then.i return home. he is deep asleep from his wounds. i never really asked him how got those wounds , but i assumed that his family were at their limits. and reporting his family to the police meant making his way into the asylum. he needed therapy but it would probably ruin anything his future holds. i took out a airport type bag and went over to his place again to maybe get hold of anything he has. maybe what he wears.

they gladly welcomed me to take the ""garbage"" away. while i was collecting his stuff from his room his brother walks in. "" why exactly why are you keeping him with you? what are you in love with him? child i say you, he is dead crazy. he kills rats. almost eats them""i reply him with a , "" i dont know why i'm keeping him. yes i love him, not romantically, i have a girlfriend. i know how crazy he is. but he isn't crazy with me. ""he rolls his eyes and stumps away.

i told my mom that a friend was staying with me since he got kicked out. my mother first asked whether we had contacted cps , but i made up some scenario that his family was crazy and hes almost 17. a year more he'd be 18 and it wouldn't matter. we never really had financial problems and mom visited rarely whenever she got her chance during which i managed to get him to behave.

i knew i couldn't keep him for long if he wasn't changing. the only advantage i had was him not being crazy and violent at me. i could feel his inner instincts saw me as a motherly/protective figure.getting him to the local therapist without letting my mom know was the hardest part.nothing was easy . the first 30 days with him were absolutely horrible. he had no conduct , no manners. like i knew he didn't but tolerating that for a whole day was again a new drama. i became a mini therapist myself. i had studies too, but i was already in college and was communicated from home not campus hostels. i had to reason and logic with his every wrong deed.you see it is easier to logic a dumb person than a person who already understands the consequences.the hardest part in his recovery was making him understand why is it wrong to do something wrong.like literally what i said. but very slowly it did work out.of course my mother found out one day of what kind of a person i was letting to freeload. but by that time he was , much much normal. only if his family had put a bit more effort on him.

he will be 25 next month. we live in a different state now. he looks absolutely sane. acts sane. has a stable job. no one can tell he was a human form of devil once in his life. he has an understanding and patient boyfriend. he would soon move out and live with him completely. i was sternly against the idea of telling his boyfriend about his past hell-hound. but Dan insisted himself that his boyfriend should know. the man didn't believe shit at first. but since he has noticed a few odd behaviors from Dan himself he can make a guess.

he didn't try to contact his family at all. i mean if i were in his shoes i wouldn't either. but his mother once contacted me via facebook. his mother did not have an account before so Dan couldn't block her. she check quite a bit of his profile. and all she wrote to me was, "" is he happy?''. i was surprised at her message and said yes because he indeed was. after a few this and that chat she ended with, ""thank you for doing my job.""

i was gonna say that no maam he pays me occationally for taking care of him back in time and even though i say that theres no need of payment your love is enough i do take the cash.but i ended the conversation with an emoji",2,1584859015,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fmvi4b/rf_i_let_my_sadistic_psychotic_friend_stay_with/,WritingPrompts,1

fmohqp,userdiedwithjulie,[RF] I let my Sadistic psychotic friend stay with me and recover instead of handing him over to the asylum or cops," 

I met my friend when i was like in grade 4. He was always a troubled child. he argued with the teachers. hurt other kids. tore books, banged benches until he realized he couldn't break them. not one single day passed that he didn't cause a mess. the more we grew more crazier he became. i was not his friend until we were like 10-12 years old.i was 2 years and two grades older, but i did know him.

He once entered the female changing room where i was too , and dragged a girl by hair half naked. no one knew why. both kids' the guardians were called. he never said why he did what he did and was suspended nonetheless. by this time i was his friend, well rather acquaintance. why you ask? because we both were queer and closeted. how we got to know we both were queer is a story for another day.so when i asked him why he did so, his simple reply was, ""it was fun."" and just that. he would behave rudely with almost anyone. well except me. for some reason.

when i got a girlfriend. he got really jealous for a while, saying she was snatching me away from him. no he wasn't obsessed with me. maybe his unconsciousness was scared of loosing the only friend he had. he soon got over being mad at my girlfriends or boyfriends as they changed quiet a few times. he would often come over at my place ( i live alone, mom used to be always out of station and send money, no dad). he would come over. say nothing, cry at my shoulder and then without a word leave. i knew his parents hated him. he was enough crazy outside , i wonder what he was inside the house where his freedom formed more wings. his parents once tried to put him in an asylum but it didn't work out. he voluntarily got out.therapies never worked on him.by the time he was 14 he had assaulted (just beaten up, nothing sexual) countless people our age, dogs, animals. his parents were fed up of him. he hated his older brother, whom his parents obviously focused more on.he never bothered me with any of his crazy antics, yes he was clearly crazy in front of me. but never did the ""crazy deeds"". i mostly ignored all his bullshit rants. and he was just satisfied by screaming bullshit into my ears.the only thing he was good at was studies. academically he was not a problem, but everything else about him was a problem.one day he arrives at my door step. he wasn't on his bicycles, mind you it takes a 30 minute walk from his place to mine.he was covered in bruises and was bleeding from his nose. but he has been hurt like this before but on his own. this clearly looked like someone did this to him.he collapsed on me, i took him to my spare bedroom and rode my way to his house.much to my shock , the fire brigade was there. black smoke everywhere. the tree house in his yard was burned down.when i went to his father he gave me a 'what the fuck do you want ' look.pretending that i don't know anything i asked him where my friend Dan was. "" that little devil is never ever returning here. you better find sane friends. and if you ever see him, say, we're done with him. he ain't our family no more."" without much question i turned around. ' he lit the green tree up huh' is what i thought then.i return home. he is deep asleep from his wounds. i never really asked him how got those wounds , but i assumed that his family were at their limits. and reporting his family to the police meant making his way into the asylum. he needed therapy but it would probably ruin anything his future holds. i took out a airport type bag and went over to his place again to maybe get hold of anything he has. maybe what he wears.

they gladly welcomed me to take the ""garbage"" away. while i was collecting his stuff from his room his brother walks in. "" why exactly why are you keeping him with you? what are you in love with him? child i say you, he is dead crazy. he kills rats. almost eats them""i reply him with a , "" i dont know why i'm keeping him. yes i love him, not romantically, i have a girlfriend. i know how crazy he is. but he isn't crazy with me. ""he rolls his eyes and stumps away.

i told my mom that a friend was staying with me since he got kicked out. my mother first asked whether we had contacted cps , but i made up some scenario that his family was crazy and hes almost 17. a year more he'd be 18 and it wouldn't matter. we never really had financial problems and mom visited rarely whenever she got her chance during which i managed to get him to behave.

i knew i couldn't keep him for long if he wasn't changing. the only advantage i had was him not being crazy and violent at me. i could feel his inner instincts saw me as a motherly/protective figure.getting him to the local therapist without letting my mom know was the hardest part.nothing was easy . the first 30 days with him were absolutely horrible. he had no conduct , no manners. like i knew he didn't but tolerating that for a whole day was again a new drama. i became a mini therapist myself. i had studies too, but i was already in college and was communicated from home not campus hostels. i had to reason and logic with his every wrong deed.you see it is easier to logic a dumb person than a person who already understands the consequences.the hardest part in his recovery was making him understand why is it wrong to do something wrong.like literally what i said. but very slowly it did work out.of course my mother found out one day of what kind of a person i was letting to freeload. but by that time he was , much much normal. only if his family had put a bit more effort on him.

he will be 25 next month. we live in a different state now. he looks absolutely sane. acts sane. has a stable job. no one can tell he was a human form of devil once in his life. he has an understanding and patient boyfriend. he would soon move out and live with him completely. i was sternly against the idea of telling his boyfriend about his past hell-hound. but Dan insisted himself that his boyfriend should know. the man didn't believe shit at first. but since he has noticed a few odd behaviors from Dan himself he can make a guess.

he didn't try to contact his family at all. i mean if i were in his shoes i wouldn't either. but his mother once contacted me via facebook. his mother did not have an account before so Dan couldn't block her. she check quite a bit of his profile. and all she wrote to me was, "" is he happy?''. i was surprised at her message and said yes because he indeed was. after a few this and that chat she ended with, ""thank you for doing my job.""

i was gonna say that no maam he pays me occationally for taking care of him back in time and even though i say that theres no need of payment your love is enough i do take the cash.but i ended the conversation with an emoji",3,1584830114,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fmohqp/rf_i_let_my_sadistic_psychotic_friend_stay_with/,WritingPrompts,1

When people see her they think she’s perfect,
That she’s blessed gifted and talented.

But few know of her reality,
As horrifying as the word itself.

Her parents excluded,
For they believed the lies her face shows.

They see her for who she portrays herself to be,
And ignore the strain and the tears.

How she wishes her life was different,
How she wishes she could live elsewhere.

Where privacy was given not demanded,
Where drama was just entertainment not life.

Where love was mutual not unrequited,
Where good hearts were appreciated not spurned.

\---

Otway Shore’s Mental Institution had stood tall for a hundred years, and perhaps would stand for a thousand more. Toiled from the labour of long dead men, the once red walls had now been reduced to that kind of battered brown, the kind that has weathered the rain and the hail, the kind that doesn’t shimmer under the summer sun but rather stews, both shifting and solid at once. The musty, ominous windows were metres tall, barred from the inside, looming over the yard. The shingled roof seemed Victorian era, deep purple, with attic windows that were always dark, leading to rooms that Jana had never seen. Indeed, the building had a face to it, a twisted scowl and weathered eyes, and when you looked too closely you could see it coming apart at the seams, like wrinkles. It was the face of a spiteful god, moving all the pieces on his chess game into the right place, so he could strike it all down at once. Jana pushed through the wooden doors and entered.

The reception of the building was pleasant enough, in stark contrast to the outside. Patterned tiles and warm lighting offset the grey autumn light streaming in through the windows, and the staff wore smiles. The receptionist, Kira, greeted her with a smile. “Hallo Jana. I thought you were still on sick leave? Olegsei said you wouldn’t be back until next month.”

Jana smiled, pulling her warm coat off and hanging it on the staff rack. “Oh, I’m just popping in to check on Michael, is all. I’ve missed a few of our weekly visits, so I want to get back on track.”

Kira nodded, hands flitting across her keyboard. “Well, he’s been moved to section B2 in accordance with the quarantine policy. You know the way?”

Jana nodded. “Of course. Thanks, Kira.”

Section B2 was relatively close to reception, compared to the other housing areas. Jana weaved through the corridors, walking through the dim white halls, paint peeling off the edges. She soon reached the gate, and with a quick wave at the administrator, the alarm buzzed and the gate swung open.

Jana found herself in the lounge, couches and tables about, with residents strewn across the place, some in groups conversing, some alone. She surveyed the area a bit, before she spotted him.

Michael was old. He had been in the asylum for longer than Jana had been alive. He was indeed a regular, and he wouldn’t speak with anyone except her. He often said he felt a strange connection with her, as if he had found a long-lost sister, and he was always excited for their weekly chats.

But today, he wasn’t excited. He was solemn. He was sat in his rocking chair, but he was unnaturally still. A blanket draped his lap, and his eyes were unfocused. His hair was scraggly and untamed, and his wrinkles were deep-set. When Jana approached him, he didn’t even look up. She took a seat opposite him, and examined his strange expression. He had never acted like this before; at least, he had never acted like this around her before.

They sat this way with for nearly a minute, before Michael finally spoke. “Do you ever feel like you can remember past lives, Jana?”

Jana smiled, her expression curious. “How do you mean?”

Michael was still unfocused, staring at nothing. His voice was croaky. “I mean… that sensation that my birth was not the beginning. And my death will not be the end.”

Jana looked at him ponderously. “My mother always said that our night dreams were just memories of lives we had already lived, and our day dreams were visions of a life we would one day live. She said it was a cycle, and it went on and on, forever.”

Michael was hesitant again, and then he asked; “Can we walk?”

Soon they were outside the asylum, breathing in the crisp early air. It was a lovely morning, Jana decided, though she had previously judged otherwise. The cold was bracing, but in a good way, and the air smelled of that freshness that came with the rising sun on a cloudy day. She hugged her coat tighter around her, and looked sideways at Michael, who had insisted in wearing nothing but the same, pyjama-like clothes all the residents wore. He must’ve been freezing, but his face was serious, and he betrayed no signs of cold.

“You know, Jana, I have not told you all there is to tell about me.” Michael said. “I know you may think that I am crazy, or delusional, or just another patient spewing some sob story, but the truth is that I am none of those things.”

He went quiet. Jana prodded him with her finger. “Go on then, say it.”

Michael licked his lips, building up the courage. “I have seen the future, Jana. In a few century’s time, there will be a great catastrophe, one that shatters not just this universe but everything universe. All of time and space will collapse, and infinite destruction will be wrought. I saw it, and lived through it, and died from it. And then, I was reborn.”

“Reborn as the man before me?” Jana asked quizzically.

“No.” Michael muttered. “I came much later. I have been born again and again, in different time periods. In different places where little things have happened that will play a big role in the future, in causing the catastrophe. I have to prevent it, Jana. I have to prevent it.”

Jana took it all in, digesting his words. “Why are you telling me this?”

“Because I need you to help me, Jana. I need you to get me out. So I can defeat him.”

Jana felt a shiver run up her spine. “Who is… him?”

Michael stopped his pacing, and turned to face her. He looked directly in her eyes. “Joseph. The man who is doing the opposite. He is working against me; working to ensure the catastrophe happens. I have to stop him. I have to prevent it, to save everyone.”

Jana examined him, studying his eyes and his wrinkles. Michael softly asked; “You believe me, right?”

Jana turned then, and kept walking, and Michael followed her. “What do you expect me to do?”

Michael swallowed. “The reason I was put here, in this asylum, all those years ago, is because I tried to kill a boy; McCulley. That boy will grow up to be an inventor, a genius, who designs some of the devices that will be used to usher in the catastrophe. I failed to stop him, and they locked me up here, but I can still do it. I can still finish him off. I know it sounds crazy… but I need you to get me out of here.”

Jana pursed her lips. After a moment’s hesitation, she said; “I believe you, Michael. Come with me.”

She brought him with her, and he entered her car, an old man sitting on the passenger’s seat, a young woman behind the wheel. But Jana knew that things were not quite that simple. For Michael was not just an old man, he was a being, alive for millennia, in a cycle of death and rebirth.

“Thank you, Jana.” He said. “Thank you…”

Jana nodded. “Of course, Michael.” She pulled out of the park and onto the road, looking at the asylum in her rear view. It would be maybe an hour before the staff realised that she and Michael had been gone too long, so she would need to be quick.

As they sped down the highway, Michael turned to her. “The address is-”

“I know the address.” Jana said.

Michael looked at her with a furrowed brow, and then his eyes widened. “No…” He gasped. “You couldn’t… how?”

Jana looked at him, and smiled. “I remember sitting where you sat, Michael, and I remember having this exact conversation, but I said the words you are saying. Everything comes around. In order for you to kill him, someone had to get you out. That someone was me.”

Michael gaped. “How old are you?” He demanded. “How much more do I have to go, until I am you?”

Jana stared ahead. “You’ve barely scratched the surface of the eons that will bring you to being me. You don’t know all there is to know; not yet. And you don’t know Joseph like I do.”

Michael looked at her. “You know Joseph? You must kill him. You must stop him!”

“It will happen, Michael, in time.” Jana said. “But for now, I need to focus on helping you do what you have to do.”

\---

Later, Jana would reflect on all this. She wondered if she did the right thing. Now, and all those lives ago, when she had been Michael. She wondered if it had all been worth it.

The door buzzed. “Lawyer’s here to see you,” the police officer said, and the door opened. A stout man entered, wearing glasses and carrying a suitcase. He took a seat at the desk, and regarded her, reclining on the floor against the grey concrete wall.

“How did it go?” He inquired.

Jana was quiet for a time. She felt guilty, in some absurd way. “It worked, just like you knew it would. He killed McCulley.”

The man nodded. “And he believed you when you said you wanted to help prevent the catastrophe?”

“Yes.”

Joseph removed the glasses from his face. It was deep set with lines and marks of stress. He gently placed the glasses on the table, and then placed his hands together. “Good.” He intoned. “Everything is playing out as it must. Michael killed McCulley, an act that will eventually be used as the foundation for the Security Union of Scientists, the group that will ultimately cause the catastrophe. The pieces are being moved into place. Things are proceeding just as they need to.”

“What now?” Jana asked. There was a desperation in her tone she hadn’t meant to be there. “They’re going to punish me. Lock me up for the rest of my life.”

“For the rest of this life. You’ve served your usefulness, Jana.” Joseph said. “Now you may go on with things until the next reincarnation. You will likely spend a life in here, so long as you don’t kill yourself first. As for me, I have to meet with another version of you.”

Joseph made to leave. “Wait!” Jana cried. “Why are you doing this? Why are you making me do this?”

Joseph turned, and regarded her coolly. “Such things aren’t meant for you to know, Jana. In time, you will understand. Just as Michael has barely scratched the surface of all the lives that will bring him to being you, you have barely scratched the surface of all the lives that will bring you to being me.” He put on his glasses. “The catastrophe must be allowed to proceed. Someday you will see why. Until then, you must trust in me – and trust in yourself.”

Joseph pushed through the prison door, and with a slam it shut behind him, leaving Jana alone.",2,1584760407,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fm8e6y/pi_you_have_reincarnated_into_countless_universes/,WritingPrompts,1

fm1g0n,Leebeewilly,[CW] Feedback Friday – No Dialogue,"I said [*shhhh*!](https://media.giphy.com/media/NdKVEei95yvIY/source.gif)

&amp;nbsp;

#Feedback Friday!


###How does it work? 

Submit one **or both** of the following in the comments on this post:

**Freewrite:**
Leave a story here in the comments. A story about what? Well, pretty much anything! But, each week, I’ll provide a single constraint based on style or genre. So long as your story fits, and follows the rules of WP, it’s allowed! You’re more likely to get readers on shorter stories, so keep that in mind when you submit your work. 

***Can you submit writing you've already written?*** You sure can! Just keep the theme in mind and all our handy rules. If you are posting an excerpt from another work, instead of a completed story, please detail so in the post.

**Feedback:**

Leave feedback for other stories! Make sure your feedback is clear, constructive, and useful. We have loads of great [Teaching Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/teaching) posts that feature critique skills and methods if you want to shore up your critiquing chops.

 &amp;nbsp;

###Okay, let’s get on with it already!


#####This week's theme: [**No Dialogue**](https://media.giphy.com/media/KUOPgSNoKVcuQ/source.gif)

 &amp;nbsp;

I feel like I'm already breaking the rule by telling you more about this theme! This week I'd like you to write a story *without any dialogue*. I know, me, the queen of all talk is asking for no dialogue! Has the world gone mad?!

**What I'd like to see from stories:** This is a chance to work on your prose, to hone the skills to relay information without spoken words without it feeling like an info dump or disconnected. Or just to have a quiet story, a quiet moment - feel free to interpret the theme. But I am serious, my friends. ***Absolutely no spoken dialogue this week.*** I shall be hunting for quotation marks... 

*Keep in mind:* If you are writing a scene from a larger story (or and established universe), please provide a bit of context so readers know what critiques will be useful. Remember, shorter pieces (that fit in one Reddit comment) tend to be easier for readers to critique. You can definitely continue it in child comments, but keep length in mind. 

**For critiques:** Does it feel like the dialogue is missing? Are there areas where it's clear the piece is suffering from a lack of direct spoken word? Or does it flow naturally? Does the lack of dialogue enhance the moment? Keep in mind that it's a unique challenge and not all stories will necessarily fit or work with ""zero"" dialogue but look at ways to strengthen it or even positive crits on how well it approached the challenge. 



Now... get [typing!](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6MbbwDvwVBSLM0r6/source.gif)

 &amp;nbsp;

**Last Feedback Friday [[Genre Party:  Superstition](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fi9dkx/cw_feedback_friday_superstition/)]** 

I was really intrigued last week when a few users were talking about posting longer pieces. There has been a polite suggestion here to keep it to one comment, and I want to say that is not a HARD fast rule. You are more than welcome to post longer pieces for critique. Some stories don't fit, and keep in mind you may not get a crit if you submit a five-part short story, but I don't want anyone to feel limited in reaching out. 

Posting your story in parts is fine, just please post them under your original post. (Thank you for those that did!) 
And to those that crit our longer pieces - you are pro stars. You are awesome. You are generous and fantastic. I'm always so pleased to see people talking it out and supporting one another. 


**A final note:** If you have any suggestions, questions, themes, or genres you'd like to see on Feedback Friday please feel free to throw up a note under the stickied top comment. This thread is for our community and if it can be improved in any way, I'd love to know. Feedback on Feedback Friday? Bring it on! 

&amp;nbsp;

**Left a story?** *Great!* 

**Did you leave feedback?** *EVEN BETTER!*

**Still want more?** Check out our [archive of Feedback Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/feedback) posts to see some great stories and helpful critiques.

flvqzz,SterlingMagleby,[PI] Doom Guy goes to his first court ordered therapy session.,"*In honor of Doom Eternal’s release, and with the mods’ permission, here’s one of my prompt replies I’ve done for this subreddit*

[Link to original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/c0se8m/wp_doom_guy_goes_to_his_first_court_ordered/)


The silence was very long. Dr. Jayachandra fiddled with her elegant fountain pen, spinning it slowly between sensibly-manicured fingers, gaze fixed on some tiny trickle of the cascading-water wall behind the patient couch.

The patient himself, the man who had been who he was now for so long that even he had forgotten his original name, the creature of scar and rage and archangelic violence, lay rigid on the couch, age-yellowed eyes fixed on the ceiling. His hands, still bearing the slight aura and tremor of their divine empowerment, held what appeared to be a child's toy against his broad chest. Surprisingly deft fingers moved the joints of the figurine from one pose to the next with an almost manic speed.

""We still haven't decided what I should call you,"" Dr. Jayachandra said softly. ""I hardly think 'The Doom Slayer' appropriate in a therapeutic context, though it does I suppose highlight some...concerning aspects of your self-image.""

Another long silence.

""I'm aware we can't keep you here forever,"" the psychiatrist continued, and brushed a lock of straight black hair back behind her ear, putting it into proper place with the barrette nestled there. She gestured toward the runes circling the patient couch, still-glowing glyphs that had burned their way down to the hardwood beneath her carpet and settled there as brown-black embers. ""But the current threat is ended, and we believe this may do you some good. And, of course, reassure the surviving government officials of Earth enough that they won't try anything...foolish.""

The man on the couch made a hoarse sound in his throat, almost like a laugh, bitter as ground ashes.

Dr. Jayachandra shifted on her chair, adjusting her knee-length skirt. ""Yes, I know. You've faced worse, but the general consensus seems to be that you do have a conscience, actually a rather powerful one, and would very much prefer not to harm men and women just following orders from scared politicians. So for your sake and theirs, please talk to me.""

The figurine between the man's fingers spun into almost frantic motion and then snapped into stillness. Slowly, he turned his head to face the doctor. She held his gaze for only a moment, then looked away. Her pen went down onto the pad of paper in her lap, and her other hand went over it, hoping to cover the tremor. If he saw, he gave no sign.

""I—"" she began, but he spoke, and she fell silent. His voice was ancient, ground-in to his throat, dragging the scarring weight of disuse along with it.

""My name—what you can call me—is Saul.""


No silence this time, but no words either, not until she could catch her breath. His words were like the ringing of some relentless hammer against a burning anvil, forging mortality. She closed her eyes and decided not to fight them, accept the weight of each syllable as a burden to be borne, and found that she could, she could bear it. It was going to cost her, though.

""Okay...Saul,"" she said. ""That's a...Biblical reference, yes?"" Her gaze flicked unconsciously to the small statue of Ganesha sitting on a shelf. ""I'm afraid I'm not quite as—""

""—as a translated name, it is good enough. You have chosen to conduct this ritual in English. Every tongue has its resonant truths, though they twist and change over time. This name is connected to that. It is good enough.""

""It is good enough,"" she repeated and shuddered, mind flooded with images it couldn't quite connect. A lone Marine, defying orders, sent off the precipice of Hell as punishment. A silvered city, falling into flames, a leader, a jagged crown spiking hatred into his soul. Some tenuous thread, and then nothing, only searing echoes across distant plains. She put her head in her hands.

""It is dangerous, for you to listen,"" he said, and she nodded.

""It could be helpful as well."" The words were hard to say, but she thought they might be true and must therefore be said.

""Mmmm."" He sat up slightly, rolled his head to loosen the muscles of his neck. ""It could be. You will have to count the cost yourself. I cannot do it for you. You will have whatever gratitude I can spare. There is nothing else I can give.""

""I have,"" and she found she needed another deep, almost gasping breath, ""a professional obligation. I take that seriously.""

""I know what it is to follow a profession to the bitter end,"" he said simply, and his hands clenched, unclenched, dropping the figurine onto his chest and seeming to pull slightly on the space his fingers moved through.

""I suppose you do,"" she said, and accepted the images that fought through her brain, let them contend and then fade, but not quite. To be stumbled on later. To be counted as cost. She clenched her jaw, fought a fight of her own and won it. Focus returned, and she found the words she needed. ""Tell me how you feel, how you've felt, since you woke up on that slab on Mars.""

""Rage,"" he said simply. ""But not mine. That has long since burned itself out. The demons, they are rage, but I am worse. I could not be worse, if the rage were only mine.""

Something screamed its way through the expanse of her awareness, fire and biting stone and terrible purpose, and she had to close her eyes until all but the afterknowledge had passed. ""I...whose rage, then, if not yours?""

He sat up. It was smooth and abrupt and implacable. ""The dead,"" he said simply. ""The ones the dead left behind. The ones doomed by the demons and those who enabled him. Mine is the rage that rises from the doom that has been, the doom that is and will be. That is what I feel. It drives me. Rip and tear.""

""Until it is done,"" she whispered, and had to shield her eyes at the sudden radiance of the runes around her patient's couch.

""Until it is done,"" he agreed, and stood up. ""Do you understand, now?""

She could only nod. She saw it, felt it, heard it, the pain and rage and despair, mothers fathers sisters sons and all the rest, the doom and the rage that came from those left behind, the cut-short rage of victims flung out by the sudden jolt of death and absorbed into this man, this not-man, this once-man, doom smelted to purpose and poured into this mold with his scars and his tremor-struck hands steadied only by weapon or blood.

""Thank you, Doctor,"" he said, and stepped over the burned-out runes on his way to the door. ""This has been helpful. But I am not yet done.""

And under shifting skies,

# **Happy Thursday writing friends!**

I don't have much insight for you on this theme. Literal interpretations will lead to giants among humankind, or perhaps we are the giants. I'm hoping for some interesting outside-the-box ideas, though! Gonna be a great week! Happy writing &lt;3

You are starting to get tired of your superpower-based job.","[Original prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/ezfn1z/wp_after_superpowers_start_appearing_around_the/) by  [u/8panckakes4ever](https://www.reddit.com/user/8panckakes4ever/) 

Not long after I first got my powers I read about Superman. He was a creation of the comic book industry. After the second world war, when real powers began to manifest, comic books transitioned to pirates and zombies and the like but back in 1938, when superman was born, they still included stories about ordinary people with extraordinary powers.

Superman fought crime. Practically everyone with powers in early comic books fought crime or committed it. Superman had the perfect AIM power set that’s now considered a basic necessity for an effective individual combatant: Attack Invulnerability Mobility.

But even superman wouldn’t have been that great a force for justice all by himself.

Superman’s invulnerability was nearly perfect. No reasonable amount of force would break his skin. He couldn’t be poisoned. He didn’t seem to need oxygen or a survivable temperature or pressure to remain perfectly comfortable.

But he was vulnerable to both special glowing green rocks and magic. So if anyone found an ever-sharp blade, or a ritual dagger, or even some of that kryptonite he’d be a goner. All someone would have to do was nick his aorta with such a weapon and he’d slowly but surely bleed out. You can’t stitch skin that you can’t pierce and you can’t apply a tourniquet to a man of steel. Worse yet, Superman would have made it easy. He used to just stand there and let bullets bounce off his chest. Baldr could have told him why that’s a bad idea for a man with any weakness no matter how obscure.

I have no idea if anything like that happened to Superman. As I say, the comic didn’t have a particularly long run. It ended in the mid-fifties when the things it imagined started to become a reality. Magic only started to come back into the world at the turn of the twentieth century, so it wasn’t all that common by 1955. It might have been overlooked by the authors of the comic.

In the real world, Superman would be flying satellites into orbit. A reaction-less flier like good old Supe can make tens of thousands of dollars per trip just lifting something out of the atmosphere. It seldom makes sense for them to do anything else with their time. If he couldn’t fly his x-ray vision would have allowed him to become a brilliant surgeon. His laser vision might have allowed him to become a welder, or for more money than that, an underwater welder. With his strength, he might have replaced any number of pieces of heavy equipment in construction.

He might have fought crime if he was only bulletproof. The police departments are happy to hire anyone who isn’t bothered by a gunshot to the face, and who doesn’t have something better to do with their time. But he still would’ve fought with proper backup, training, and support. Criminals are way less interested in tracking down that magic knife they need to kill you if they know there are 10,000 other cops at your back, and your investigative results are backed up in the central database.

I guess my point is you’ve got to make smart choices when you’re deciding how to use your powers. Lord knows I wish I had.

“Mike, dude, smell this!”

I looked up from my chemistry homework to my roommate Eddy who’d just burst into the small apartment we shared. Whatever he wanted me to smell I was already smelling. I could smell everything in the apartment and a pretty good selection of the stuff outside of it.

I tuned in on my nose for a moment and picked through the endless data it shovels in my direction. The McDonalds down the street had just finished a new batch of fries. Traffic was lighter than usual. Eddy had a dime bag of pot in his pocket. He was probably talking about that last bit.

“The weed,” I asked.

“I’m glad my high-school principal couldn’t do that, man.

Privately, I suspected that if Eddy’s high-school principal had a super nose he would’ve realized Eddy smoked less than he had assumed. My roommate was possessed of a natural dopiness and a fondness for the word ‘man’ that bordered on the pathological. However, he only smoked a couple of times a month. He wouldn’t have been my roommate if he was always walking around reeking of smoke. As it was, I could still smell the smoke from weeks ago on his clothes, but I can smell a lot of things.

“OK, brah, is it good shit? This hot chick in my econ class figured I had the hookup and I want to impress her. Nudge says this is his premium UltravioletVoodoo Dank.”

That posed a moral dilemma. Whatever Eddy had in his pocket it wasn’t that great. I could smell the THC and CBD, or at least I could smell the same unique things I always smelled around marijuana. I could also smell plant stuff: chlorophyll, cellulose, dirt, and the like. The relative potency of the smells told me this was OK, and the plant parts of it smelled pretty fresh. Still, I could’ve gotten a whiff of something better just by walking around the campus for an hour or so.

Should I tell Eddy? If he really had a chance of impressing some girl with his connections then I owed him his best shot. On the other hand, I’d hate to set him up for failure if he was just being scammed out of his weed by a pretty face. Was it really possible anyone would actually be impressed by pot connections?

Yeah, maybe.

This was Purdue University right in the heart of Indiana corn country. They might have legal artisanal hand-grown marijuana salads at the foodie restaurants on the coasts, but the Boilermakers still had to work a little for a fix even if no one cared that much. Plus there was a chance this was an excuse the girl had come up with to get close to Eddy himself.

I’m not a connoisseur of men’s looks, but Eddy looks good. There’s even something about this whole “woaw man, far out,” vibe that works for at least some women. I’d once asked a mutual female friend about it and she said he was like a big goofy labrador and you can’t resist scratching behind his ears at least once.

If little green men with three heads breathing methane through their belly buttons land on earth tomorrow I expect their aesthetic sensibilities to make more sense than that. The fact remained that there was a real chance this was just a pretty girl finding an excuse to smoke up with Eddy. That tore it for me. I owed him his best shot.

“It’s fine. It could be better.”

His face fell. He really did look a little like a disappointed lab. “Ah, bummer dude.”

“Sorry,” I said. “I’m sure it’ll still be fine.”

“Um, well, if you’re OK with it you could maybe help me out.”

I raised my eyebrows. I didn’t see how. I didn’t smoke. I avoid any sort of fire whenever I can. Was he planning to just run around campus asking people where they got their drugs? That wouldn’t end well.

Eddy looked really embarrassed and hesitant. “When I asked Nudge for his good stuff he said he was getting low. That’s why I asked you to sniff this. He told me he could get me in touch with his supplier. She doesn’t really sell, but she’d be interested in meeting you.” Eddy rubbed his neck and looked away. “You know, man, let’s not do it. I shouldn’t have said anything, man.”

I gave Eddy a suspicious look wondering if he was trying to manipulate me. He looked uncomfortable and started to move towards the kitchen, “I’m gonna nuke some pizza from last night. You want any?”

I didn’t think he was. He wasn’t that good of an actor, and he didn’t smell nervous. I asked a stupid question, “Why would she want to meet me, and how would this go exactly?”

\* \* \*

“Pretty incredible isn’t it?”  I only knew the speaker as ‘The Nose’ or Jane Doe. And she’d winced when eddy called her The Nose, so I was mostly thinking of her with the obviously fake name she’d used for our reservations.

“I can’t smell any of them,” I heard the amazement in my own voice and it made me sound like a bit of a rube, but I couldn’t help it. I nodded subtly at a 50-something woman with huge hair a few tables away. “She’s clearly a ‘too much lavender’ but I’m not getting any of it.”

“A too much lavender,” Eddy asked as Jane covered her mouth and tried to stifle what could only be called giggles. She wasn’t at all what I’d pictured when nudge had set up this meeting. She was somewhere in her upper 20’s or lower 30’s and she wore the years lightly enough she could’ve been a pretty doctoral student. Her clothes were ordinary business professional.  High end, I thought, though I’m no expert.

“Sissssh, not so loud,” I scolded Eddy without looking at the woman. “She’ll notice. But yes. Her shampoo, lotion, laundry detergent, soap, perfume… hell toothpaste maybe. I don’t know what drives these people. Something would have too much lavender and I’d be trying to eat while huffing the stuff.”

Jane got control of herself and nodded. “It’s true. It ain’t easy to eat with enhanced senses. Even if the oders don’t put you off your feed it’s still like trying to listen to music in a noisy room. This place has some sort ah crazy air filtration system. Those vents,” she gestured above our heads, “are feeding cool filtered air that falls to those vents.” She pointed down at a small grate under the table.  We’re eating in our own little column of clean air. The owner of this place made a bundle off his enhanced senses and then started it. I think it's been more successful than they’d expected.”  A southern accent had crept into her voice.  Rural southern, not the accent of the debutant set.

The waitress arrived interrupting the conversation for a moment as everyone ordered. Acting on Jane’s advice I got something spicy. Smell has a huge impact on taste and ever since I got my powers I’ve found spicy foods to be kind of unbalanced.  Here, along with the pure air, the kitchen could adjust foods for super noses and tongues.

As we waited for the food to come, I picked up the previous conversation. “I’d like to know how you make a bunch of money with just enhanced senses or an enhanced nose at least.”

Jane took a sip of her water and gave me a measured look. Her accent was practically gone when she spoke again. “Well, I do have some ideas on that front. I take it you’re going the test lab route?”

I must have reacted to that because she gave me a smile with a lot of white teeth and explained, “Nudge said you were majoring in chemistry.”

“Yeah, that’s my plan.”

“The test lab route,” Eddy asked.  I was a little surprised he didn’t know.  We’d been roommates for two years, but I supposed I’d never asked what he intended to do with his marketing degree.

It was actually Jane who answered the question, “You know how superpowers are generally pretty valuable, right?”

“Hellz yeah! Wish I could teleport, man.”

“Right. Well, a super nose doesn’t get you that much all by itself.  At least not if we’re talking about a nose of the quality that might exist somewhere else in the animal kingdom.  If you can smell the Higgs field or something all bets are off.  The problem isn’t that it’s not useful.  We can smell a lot of important things: early-stage cancer, high blood sugar, a pool with a messed up Ph.  It’s just that there are chemical tests for basically everything we can smell and they offer a more precisely calibrated and less fallible result. If you want to use your nose in your career you need a skill-set that dovetails into the work.  With a chemistry degree Mike here could be running a whole testing shift at a Quest Diagnostics lab or water treatment plant in a few years. He might make as much as 6 figures.”

Jane didn’t say “six figures” as though it was a sum that impressed her.

Then she winked and reached into her purse and pulled out several foil packs of what looked to be Folgers coffee.  They didn’t smell like coffee. “Or, maybe, he could find a way to test something that doesn’t typically get sent to official labs.  But we’ll talk about that after you find your buddy the 100% pure arabica beans he gets to take home as a finders fee for introducing you to me.  What do you say?”

\* \* \*

Three weeks passed after I ate with Jane. Eddy got the girl, or maybe the girl got Eddy.  Emma proved to be this hot little stone and she also barely ever smelled like drugs. They were kind of perfect for each other in a “too cute to stand” way.

Jane must have spent her time doing some sort of background check on me. She was quiet for two weeks and then she contacted me with an offer of, “A quick four-day road trip where I could learn about her business and ask any questions I had.”

I like to think I would never have taken her up on it, but I spent my time failing chemistry.  Well, that’s overly dramatic. I was pulling a high D in my majors classes and pulling my overall GPA up to a high C or low B with my gen ed work.  With my nose, and maybe retaking a couple of my worst classes, that would be enough for a lot of jobs.

The problem was I was beginning to realize I neither got, nor liked, chemistry. The professors and more competent students could see connections I missed.  Now and then, someone would say something was beautiful or elegant and I’d have no idea why they thought so.

The depressing reality of the situation was, if I stayed on my current path, I’d spend the remainder of my life smelling more talented people than me doing dull things. That was why I took Jane up on her offer.

The drive from Indiana to New Mexico took us two days. At first, we talked about her business about which she was stunningly candid. She purchased drugs from a manufacturer or someone close to one and sold them to a retailer or someone up the chain from one. From a business perspective, she was a simple wholesaler. What made her special was she knew the quality of the product at a sniff and had made a name for never trading in anything other than 100% pure whatever. That was plenty valuable in an industry where most of the product was cut several times before it reached the end consumer and nobody trusted anyone else.

I asked her if she, “Sold to kids,” which was probably a line I’d gotten from some piece of fiction somewhere. I could practically hear a drug dealer in an episode of Law And Order humanizing himself by saying, “I don’t sell to no kids.” He was probably talking to Ice-T.

Jane had laughed. She said she sold to people who sold to drug dealers. She didn’t know of any eight-year-olds with a gang of guys pushing crank, but if she met one she expected it was going to be hard to say “No” to such a little go-getter.

Then she’d gotten serious and told me that what she sold could cause harm. I shouldn’t try to convince myself it was just candy. But, then again, candy could cause plenty of harm. Diabetics eat candy and slowly die.

“Plenty of people say, ‘High fructose corn syrup is basically a drug.’”  She’d gestured at the fields of green corn we were driving past, “Would you like to hop out and set those on fire?”

It was some sophomoric moral equivalence but try as I might I couldn’t pop it. I wasn’t in possession of a compelling reason people shouldn’t use drugs if they chose and, at the time, I was having a hard time figuring out why I shouldn’t get rich figuring out the quality of drugs.

Two days was too much time to talk about Jane’s fairly simple business. Two hours was more time than we would’ve needed, really, and we soon drifted to other topics. I learned Jane had grown up in what she called ‘the trade.’ In fact, Her family was practically gentry.

Her great, great grandfather had been a rum-runner and fairly successful at it. Then alcohol had become legal again and he’d lost nearly everything trying to go legit. Her great grandfather and grandfather had gone into pot at the point it was being criminalized to a greater extent. The 60’s and 70’s had been another low point for the family as that drug became more widely accepted, and they’d experimented with other substances before finally settling on cooking amphetamines right before all the good nasal decongestants got locked up behind the pharmacist’s counter. When Jane had come into her powers she'd gotten pulled into the family business making sure the product was pure and equipment was running well. The remainder of her business snowballed from there.

“How’d you get your powers anyway?” I asked. The question is slightly personal, but it gets asked so much that everyone with a power has some pat answer to it even if they don’t want to tell the real story.

“Oh, I’m a Snap,” Jane answered.

That raised more questions than it answered. A Snap is the class of powered individuals who just “snapped” during a stressful situation and ended up with superhuman abilities. “Wait, what? How’s that possible? Was someone trapped under a burning car and you had to smell it off them?”

I was driving at that point. Jane blushed and became very interested in something out of the passenger window.  I barely heard her mumbled reply, “My cat got lost.”

“And?”

She turned back to look at me. The accent was back in her voice, “When ah was 13 ah had this kitty named boots. Well, I still have the old furball actually. But when I was 13 he got lost and I was terrified he was gonna git et by a cyot. I started to think if I could smell him like a bloodhound I could go git him and he’d be safe. I guess I just wanted that more than anything else and before long ‘Snap!’  I did find him.”

“Huh, well, I guess I’m glad it worked out.”

We drove in silence for about a mile and then Jane said, “Well alright you gotta dish now. How’d you come by enhanced offaction?”

“Ah, I’m the sacred protector of a lost Amazon tribe.”

“Seriously?”

“Cross my heart! When I was still in high school my folks decided to take my sister down to Brazel to do some ecotourism - see the rainforest before it’s gone.  That type of thing. For about a week that’s what we did. But after we’d hiked our fill we spent some time in Sao Paulo.  We went to the beach, did some shopping… whatever. During the shopping part of that, I got separated from my parents. I mean, we were all on the same street in a touristy area and we all had cell phones, but I wasn’t with my mom or dad when this old lady came up and started waving a kabob in my face and shouting at me in Portuguese.“

“I figured she was with one of the restaurants. You know, just handing out some free samples to drum up business. I still didn’t want the mystery meat on a stick, but I ate it to get her to leave me alone.”

My mouth tingled just a bit at the memory. “It was the hottest thing I have ever eaten. I’m not kidding. My mouth burned for three days!  My nose ran the entire time. When it finally cleared up I could smell… everything.”

I sort of trailed off at that point prompting Jane to ask, “And then?”

“Then my high school guidance counselor recommended I consider a chemistry degree.”

Jane gave me an annoyed look. She was cute when she was annoyed. “When did you learn about the whole, ‘sacred guardian,’ thing?”

“Oh, five minutes after I ate the nuclear kabob of doom. This guy, still kind of old but younger than the woman runs up and starts to pull her away. Then he sees me standing there dying and realizes I ate her food. He tells me it’s safe, just spicy.  He explains the lady is his mother and she’s the wise woman of a rainforest tribe trying to find the guardian of the tribe and do some ritual.  Only the kicker is the tribe is long gone. They were run off their land by logging or farming or something way back in the 80’s. Brazilian social services integrated them into the population and that was that. But mom’s getting Alzheimer's. She’s forgotten the last 30 years and just remembers the tribe has a problem so she does this every time she gets out of his sight.”

I shrugged, “By the time I knew the meat had something other than ghost pepper to it I was back in the states and didn’t even have their names.  I goggled a bit, but short of just going back down there and shouting, ‘I am the chosen one,’ in the street I’ve got nothing.”

“Wow, why do you suppose it worked on you?”

I shrugged again. “No idea! Maybe that time she remembered some ingredient she always forgot before. Or I had some special gene that got activated. Or I really was the chosen one. Or it worked every time and I have a hundred brother guardians out there and someday we’ll rise up and avenge this tribe I don’t even know the name of.”

“With your powerful sense of smell,” Jane winked at me.

“Well, yeah, that’s a problem. But the smell thing would’ve worked for a jungle tribe. You could smell dangerous animals lurking around the village, find food or medicinal plants, and if any kid wandered off I could track the heck out of them.”

Jand considered that for a moment. “I suppose you’re right.”

I stiffened in my seat and spoke in a monotone while staring straight ahead, “Which is why my brothers and I will tear this all down and return the land to wilderness.”

Jane looked at me for a moment then burst into giggles when I cracked a smile.  That made me realize two things. First, she had a very cute giggle. And, second, I was developing a slightly age-inappropriate crush on a drug mule.

\* \* \*

We meet Jane’s contact, Luis, in Las Cruces New Mexico at the Si Senior restaurant.

I suppose you could call Las Cruces a small desert town, but I wouldn’t because I come from Indiana.  At nearly one hundred thousand people Las Cruces would’ve been our fifth biggest city.

I know this because I googled it.

If I had to pick one word to describe Luis I’d say “twitchy”.  Actually, if I had a hundred I might still just say twitchy and keep the other 99 as change. Luis was a short, thin, Hispanic man who looked slightly unkempt.  His hair was a bit too oily and his clothes didn’t fit that well. But mostly he was twitchy.

At first I thought that was normal.  This was a drug deal, right? So he was probably worried that the cops were on to us, or that he couldn’t trust Jane, or something like that.  I was plenty nervous myself.  But Luis wasn’t looking at the other people in the restaurant. He hardly even blinked when Jane introduced me.  I would have expected some hesitance on his part just because I was a stranger, but no. His eyes kept darting to every dark or shadowed place we could see from our table.  There was one heating vent that seemed to bug him more than the others and it was almost as though he was listening to our conversation past some other noise.  I eventually decided he must be using his own product.

Si Senior had pretty good food even if it wasn’t balanced for my unique offaction.  They also had a lot of food, and by the end of the meal I was no longer nervous.  I was ready to roll under the table and go to sleep.

But life, and illegal commerce, must carry on so it was Jane that moved us to the next phase of the festivities.  “So, are you parked out back?”

“Yes,” Luis said.  Actually he almost hissed it

“Riiiigh, well, I’ll pay and meet you there.”

Luis scurried off into the bright sunshine of the New Mexican desert. Jane set out cash for our bill and a generous tip, then she looked at me, “Were you getting an odd vibe there at the end?”

“Yesssss masssster,” I hissed.

Jane rolled her eyes, but otherwise stayed serious which worried me a bit.

“I think he’s fucking using. That is not OK. When someone comes out messed up is when things go wrong and people get hurt. I’m half tempted to just drive away now, but he held it together for lunch and I didn’t smell any gunpowder on him so he hasn’t handled amo recently.”

She thought a moment and seemed to come to a decision, “We’ll go ahead with this, but you hang back in case Luis gets stupid or he brought official friends.” She bit her lower lip for a moment, “If he did bring friends this is just a mini-vacation for you. You don’t know why we’re here. You’re just young and stupid and trying to get into my pants.”

“Hey!”

Jan winked, “Well you aren’t drunk and college guys have two main reasons for doing irrational things.”  Then she headed for the door without giving me time for more argument.

I trailed after her worrying. The cover story seemed hella thin.  Maybe it could hold, but only if the cops didn’t care much at all about me. Still, would someone suddenly start talking like Renfield because they were wearing a wire? It was a stretch. Not that drugs did that either unless maybe your drug of choice was absinthe out of a skull goblet.

The Las Cruces sun hit me in the face like a hammer when I walked outside. Back in Indiana it was early soggy spring but here the days were already in the seventies and the clear blue vault of the sky looked like it had never met a cloud. I walked toward the back of the restaurant trying to blink my eyes back to some sort of correct function. Jane pulled ahead of me and marched quickly across the parking lot while I found a shady spot close enough to observe, but hopefully far enough back to stay out of anything unexpected.

Luis waited by the back of a silver Nissan Altima.  He and Jane talked for a moment too quietly for me to hear and then he popped the trunk. The car was low enough to the ground that I could see in and I caught the top of what looked like a gym bag.  Jane leaned over and I assume she checked it because she recoiled almost as though she’d been struck.

Her next words were accented again and loud enough for me to hear clearly. “What the fuck Luis? I would even expect shit this low-grade if I were paying in blowjobs! Do you think I’m looking to open a cake shop?”

Luis threw up both hands in a sort of defensive pose and said something. The words were quick and quiet. I only caught, “not for you” “look the same.”

Was he claiming he’d grabbed the wrong bag of crack on his way out the door?

He raised his hand, gave his head a slightly puzzled scratch, and then said something else. This time I caught, “go get.” He put his hand on Jane’s shoulder as though he intended to guide her over to his car. But it was all off. He was moving too fast and every line of his body was hard and tense. I was getting that creepy vibe again.

Jane slapped away Luis’s hand like he’d draped something disgusting across her shoulder. Luis seemed to come to some sort of decision at that point because he didn’t hesitate. He grabbed her hard and tried to push her towards the car.

Jame twisted and lashed out like a mule with a hard kick right into the side of his knee. There was a crack and Luis went down with his leg bent in a way that hurt to look at. Jane shot one look in his direction but didn’t linger. Instead, she started to hurry in my direction while digging in her purse for something.

Because she was facing the wrong way, she didn’t see Luis. At first, he reacted like a normal person.  With one hand he clutched at his knee, with the other he scrabbled around for something on his back.  That hand found it’s target - a knife.

The knife, it wasn’t any modern weapon or tool.  It was jagged, crude, and appeared to be chipped from some form of black stone. I couldn’t guess if it was flint, obsidian, or something else, but it certainly wasn’t metal. Just the sight of the blade made the bright sunlight feel a bit colder, and the utterly pedestrian parking lot seemed unclean somehow.

“Look out!”

Jane was fast on her feet. She didn’t ask, “What,” or stand still looking around. She jumped to the cover provided by one of the few cars scattered around the mostly empty back of the lot, crouching behind its rear tires on my side of the vehicle.

That saved her. Seconds after my warning while he was still laying on the ground, Luis whipped the knife forward in an arc parallel to the ground like he was trying to flick water off of it. Instead, the blade seemed to snag shadow out of thin air and a wave of it washed out to where Jane had been standing.

The arc of the shadow passed through empty air there. But it had spread out as it traveled and it hit the car she was behind as well. I couldn’t see the actual impact, but there was a screech of rending metal and the car heeled over as though its driver’s side front tired had been cut out from under it.

The shadow continued out across the parking lot moving from the empty back half to the more heavily occupied section where I stood.  It weakened as it spread. It cut gashes into the first few cars it hit. Then it ripped strips of paint off another few ranks. Then it hit me.

I know I shouldn’t have stood there like an idiot and let it, but it took far less time for the black energy to travel across the lot then it does to describe and I was stunned by its appearance. I had thought Luis might throw the knife - not use it to call up death magic.

Fortunately, by the time it hit me the strike was weak enough it only felt like I’d been hit with a switch. It stung and I’d have a bruise but I wasn’t cut in half.

The worst part was the smell. What I’d been thinking of as shadow reeked.  It was bloated corpses and bad meat. I felt like rotten blood had been sprayed directly into my nose. I don’t know if it would’ve been so bad for a normal person, but anyone with a sense of smell would’ve recoiled.

When I managed to look up again Luis was getting to his feet- which really shouldn’t have been possible. There was something dark wrapped around his knee. At first, I thought he’d managed to fashion a binding from some cloth, but the blackness wasn’t moving right. It was too fluid and clug in an almost form-fitting way without showing wrinkles. It was the shadow, I realized.

A movement from Jane called my attention back to her. She had edged along the car until she could lean past it and draw a bead on Luis with a huge gun she’d apparently produced from somewhere.

I stood frozen as she aimed. Should I warn him? Could this mess somehow be decelerated?

I was too late. Something must have warned Luis. His eyes flashed black for an instant and he whipped the dagger up. Black rolled off of it again just as a sharp crack cut through the relative quiet of the lot and I could see a deformed bead of metal bouncing out of sight across the empty half of the lot practically all of its momentum lost to the shield.

There was another crack and another jingle, but Luis was apparently done playing. With the square of solid shadow still hiding most of his body, he rushed forward across the four yards that separated them. As he broke around the car, Jane tried to move backwards to give herself a bit more space, but her crouch rendered her ungainly and she tripped. Her gun spun out of her hand and slid under the car.

Luis saw that and dropped his shield. Jane kicked out at him. Her foot caught him in the shin and he hissed with pain but he didn’t back off. Instead, he flipped the stone knife in the air, caught it by the blade, then cracked her on the head with its handle. I don’t know if it was more of the knife’s magic or just that she'd gotten hit on the head with a rock, but Jane crumbled.

Luis shifted the knife and then leaned down as though he intended to grab Jane and drag her away. I hadn’t known what to do up until that point. I hadn’t run over to help Jane fight Luis. First, she’d had a gun and was doing just fine on her own. And second, I didn’t really want to fight Luis. I just wanted to get away.

But I wasn’t going to let him drag her off. I shouted and charged him. It went poorly. He did that “flick away water” thing again with his knife and a scythe of darkness washed out toward me at about mid-chest height. I dropped under it, but not in a cool action star kind of way. I just leaned too far backward and fell.

It saved me, but I hit my head in the process. Then I was swallowed up in the rotten blood stink of the magic and for a minute or two the world was just lost to pain and foulness. Luis could’ve killed me then. I guess he was more interested in getting away. When I got a grip on myself, he was gone.

To a very very limited extent I can track a car via smell. The grades of gasoline, tire compounds, interiors, and cargo of a car smell different but cars move too fast to leave much of a trail.

I gathered up Jane’s stuff, ran to her car, and tried to sniff out the trail of the Altima starting from where I knew he’d been parked. I got as far as the interstate, which was only three turns out of the restaurant, before I was fairly sure I was following my imagination rather than a real car. I might have turned back then, but I was headed toward El Paso, TX and there was very little between the two cities.

I had time to catch them.  I drove like a nut swerving around cars and speeding as the in-town traffic fell off. I figured if I got stopped by a cop I could tell them what was going on and it would be in their hands, but I couldn’t quite bring myself to call them because if the whole story came out Jane would be arrested along with Luis.

In retrospect, I might have been hoping for that random traffic stop. It didn’t materialize. Around 10 miles outside of town I caught up to Luis. He was driving fast, but not “please arrest me” fast. I considered trying to pull a PIT maneuver on him, but that would’ve been stupid. I’d only ever seen videos of that and I think cop cars have specially reinforced fenders to make it work.

Instead I passed the Altima because I thought it would put Luis at ease if he’d noticed me coming up behind him.  If someone is following you they wouldn’t pass, right? He’d assume it was just another vehicle of the same make. He couldn’t see me; Jane’s windows are fairly darkly tinted.

Next, I fell in behind a slower car and let him pass me back.  When he did that I had one of the rear windows down and I got a good nose-full of the Altima. I let it fall away into the distance until I was just about to lose that scent, which was far enough away I couldn't make out many details on the car visually. Then I followed.

fkofv3,photolouis,[WP] Lovecraft story prompt based on a dream (details in text),"[I just woke up from a particularly lucid dream and remembered this group. Apologies for the non-standard format, but the details were just too good to ignore.]

I'm helping a plumber on a call to an urban home. The owner did his own plumbing job and it was leaking a lot. Copper pipes, carrying hot water, run along the wall and into the basement. Plumber susses out the problem and goes to work soldering the joints. In the basement, the pipes continue along the base of the wall and into a recently dug tunnel. I can see a homemade portcullis further down the tunnel and wonder what the hell the homeowner needs that for. He does seem a bit suspicious, but the plumber stoically completes the job, taking the whole day.

We walk through downtown and spot a recent excavation. Although it is evening, something going on there. People are gathering at the entrance and making their way down into it. The construction crew had build some sort of observation platform, something like a lifeguard station, that straddled the entrance. We climb up to see what's going on. People are walking into a tunnel cut into the clay earth. 

We sit down to discuss what might be going on and conclude that it must be some sort of guided tour. At that point, we hear a rhythmic beat and the sound of people walking in step. The people are exiting the tunnel, not marching, but deliberately striking the ground with their feet at the same time, making the rhythm. 

Something is very very off with all this. We stay hidden and watch as hundreds of people stomp their way out of the tunnel and down the sidewalks.",2,1584533026,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fkofv3/wp_lovecraft_story_prompt_based_on_a_dream/,WritingPrompts,1

fkejpr,Gruntingnerd123,[CC]Student Council runs a Mafia/Gang/Criminal Organization,"[WP]Should I write a story about high school students in the Student Council who secretly run a criminal organization who deals with drugs,arms trafficking,gambling...?

Now none of the grunts and thugs know  the identity of the mysterious and influential 'Council',not even the lieutenants,with the only person knowing their identity their respect worthy and equally mysterious right hand man 'The Speaker' who relays orders to the rest of the organization.

And then you have the Police Force who are trying their very best to stop them never realizing   the  powerful 'Council' were just some really smart high school brats who wanted to make a quick buck.

Now I'm not sure if I should write this as a fanfiction or just regualr fiction

I'm leaning more towards fanfiction because there are already characters  with personalities and backstories already fleshed out

These are my picks for the fanfiction:

Code Geass:Lelouch of the Rebellion:Lelouch goes a different route to bring down Britannia and during it accidentally involves his friends into the Revolution.

Kaguya Sama:Love is War:Shirogane realizes even if Kaguya does confess her parents will not approve of them because of him being poor,he resolves to make as much money as physically posibble,and he does not care how.

What I am looking for is advice,do's and don'ts and tips from much more eyperienced writers to help out a beginner like me.

fkcoa7,ecstaticandinsatiate,[OT] Teaching Tuesday: Pacing,"#Happy Tuesday!

Hello! I'm Static. I'm here to hopefully help make your writing life a bit easier. 

Today marks the first day of adding a workshop element to Teaching Tuesday! This is an experiment at this point, in terms of ironing out our exact process. So I’m really open to and interested in hearing from you guys about what parts of the process did or did not work for you.

If you missed last week’s post explaining my new plans, I encourage you to check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fgjpp1/ot_teaching_tuesday_plans_for_the_future/).

And now, onto the cool stuff…

##Terminology to Know 

I’m intending this part as a quick and dirty glossary, in case you want to reference back any of the terms that I’m using.

**Exposition**: Story information conveyed through summary or description removed from narrative action, rather like the voice-over in a movie. This is often what people mean when they *tell* the audience information instead of showing it. **This is not an inherently evil thing**; it’s just easy to overdo, like a kick of paprika.

&gt; Example: Jane was never a good runner. She always found some excuse to skip out on gym class on track and field days. Nausea, cramps, some imaginary fever — anything to get her sent to the nurse’s office.

**Narrative**: Story information conveyed through direct, immediate action — e.g. characters interacting with one another, observing a scene, or reacting to plot events. This is often what people mean when they say *show*, don’t tell. 

&gt; Example: Jane clutched her belly and said, “I feel really nauseous, Mr. Baker. I don’t think I can run today.” 
&gt; 
&gt; The gym teacher sighed and waved her off to the nurse’s office. Jane waited until he turned away to grin; that trick *always* worked.

**Narrative Flow**: The way the story moves. There is no best way to move a story along; there is only the particular rhythm that is right for *that* story.

##What Is Pacing?

What do we mean when we talk about pacing? **Pacing** is how we control narrative flow to set the tempo for a particular scene or moment. It is the interchange between narrative and exposition that establishes the rhythm of the scene. Pacing allows you as the writer to make some scenes urgent and panicky; tense and drawn out; quick and light-hearted; or slow and heartfelt, among near-infinite other possibilities. Anything you can imagine, you can accomplish with pacing. 

Pacing is almost never a static concept. By which I mean, it is free-flowing and should develop as a natural reflection of the characters' reaction to each other or to new information presented to them within the plot. Pacing can change from scene-to-scene, or even within a scene. There are no hard and fast rules about what is and isn't appropriate, as it is determined on a case-by-case basis. This is challenge and joy of figuring out how pacing works.

##How Do You Know Pacing When You See It?

The easiest way to see pacing illustrated, I think, is in movies. 

Try to think of some of your favorite movie scenes. Some of them might be action movies that intentionally slow the pulse of a crazy-intense chase sequence to show us a handful of seconds artificially stretched out, like [this famous scene from *Deadpool*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI-yMivF9X0)--which, you might also note, riffs on the usually urgent, fast-paced context of action scenes by starting slow with Deadpool doodling and directly addressing the audience. 

Other scenes like [this rain scene from *Pride and Prejudice*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbQbrSSn9eQ) take advantage of the long pauses and the sound of the rain to really draw out the emotionality between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth when he finally confesses his feelings for her. 

**Brainstorm**: What aspect of the pacing specifically makes your favorite movie scenes *so damn good?* What can you take away from that in terms of accomplishing the same cinematic effect in your own writing?

##Tools for Controlling Pace 

Honestly, there are countless ways to control pace in a scene, rather like how there are countless colors and shades to illustrate a painting. My intent here is to show you just a handful to get the gears of your brain going. I think the most important thing to take away from this is how to be purposeful and mindful about how word choice, sentence length, paragraph length, and descriptors can stretch out or slow down pacing. 

**Asyndeton / Polysyndeton**   
Let's throw some rhetoric in here! **Asyndeton** is when you intentionally use no conjunctions (e.g. and, but, or) where you would usually see them. **Polysyndeton** is its opposite, where you use *way the hell more* conjunctions than you ordinarily would. (See [this](https://thingsthatmadeanimpression.wordpress.com/2015/04/03/excerpt-from-a-farewell-to-arms-by-ernest-hemingway-hotel/) example from *A Farewell to Arms* to see how wonderfully far you can go with this.) 

You can remember the difference via the prefixes: poly- = many, where a- = none 

Let's look at a pair of sentences to consider how that choice impacts pacing, one way or another.

&gt; Asyndeton example: The wind howled, screamed, scrambled. We were cold, dizzy, only getting dizzier, with the night coming on fast.

Now let's compare that to:

&gt; Polysyndeton example: The wind howled and screamed and scrambled. We were cold and dizzy and only getting dizzier, with the night coming on fast.

Both of them are tense moments, but generally polysyndeton slows the pace while keeping the tension, whereas asyndeton keeps us clipping along at a frantic pace. 

**Description to Convey Time**   
You can intentionally craft your descriptions to indicate how much or how little time has passed, particularly between character responses. 

Here I'll reference a brilliant example of slowing pacing from Ernest Hemingway's (can you tell I'm a fan?) short story [*Soldier's Home*](https://genius.com/Ernest-hemingway-soldiers-home-annotated):

&gt; “I’ve worried about you so much, Harold,” his mother went on. [. . .] “I pray for you all day long, Harold.”
&gt; 
&gt; **Krebs looked at the bacon fat hardening on his plate.**
&gt;
&gt; “Your father is worried, too,” his mother went on. 

I've bolded the sentence to focus on, here. This is a gorgeous example both of showing and pacing. Hemingway doesn't have to tell us this is an awkward pause, or that Krebs is uncomfortable and unsure of how to respond. He shows it all in a single 10-word sentence. The slow pitter-patter of the rain in that *Pride and Prejudice* movie scene above accomplishes a very similar effect.

Now, an example moving in the opposite direction: description that makes us go fast and urgent.

&gt; ""Hold it right there!"" the officer yelled. 
&gt;
&gt; The robber whipped his head in either direction. **The highway traffic ripped and roared past him. A semitruck screamed past so close his ears throbbed. But the officer was already advancing, her gun raised.** He held his breath and darted across the freeway.

This description sets the scene and builds a sense of urgency and stakes (what is at risk for the character), which inherently increases the pace.

**Sentence and Paragraph Length**

Shortening or lengthening your sentences also contributes to pace. Short, clipped sentences can communicate awkwardness or halting uncertainty. Longer sentences can create a sense of urgency or desire. Compare this same idea told two different ways:

&gt; ""I love you,"" he said. 
&gt;
&gt; She froze. Stared back at him. Her mouth opened and shut. But she said nothing
&gt;
&gt; Pain bloomed in his eyes. He muttered, ""Sorry.""   

Now let's try that same scene with longer sentences in a truncated paragraph:

&gt; ""I love you,"" he said, and she could only freeze, staring back at him. Her mouth opened and shut but she said nothing. Pain bloomed in his eyes and he muttered, ""Sorry."" 

As you can see from this example, varying paragraph length also impacts pace; although, paradoxically, more frequent short paragraphs are more likely to draw your pace out. This is because it naturally slows the rate of reading and gives the impression of time hiccuping along. (Personally, I like to use this trick when I'm trying to recreate the ""slow mo"" effect you see in movies.)

**Character Action and Reaction**

Now, this is a bit of a more complicated concept. Essentially, character action should lead to reaction, either from that same character or from a different character. How you use the setup and interchange between character action and reaction can dramatically impact pace. 

You can choose to artificially extend a character's reaction, which can be helpful if you are using that character to mirror the audience's reaction to the scene. Take this for example:

&gt; They stood on the edge of the cliff and stared down at the water below. 
&gt;
&gt; ""We have to jump,"" Marie said. (character action)   
&gt;
&gt; Hasan stared at her in alarm. ""Are you kidding me? We're good as dead hitting the water from that high."" (character reaction)   
&gt;
&gt; ""We're good as dead if we stand here arguing."" She looked back over her shoulder at the stampede bearing down on them. ""Jump. *Now!*"" She hurled herself over the edge.

Hasan's reaction to Marie's absurd action establishes the pace of the scene. How much or how little you engage the argument can make the moment of decision quick and sudden or uncertain and hotly-debated. If we wanted to slow the pacing of that moment, we could add a back-and-forth argument to draw out the reaction. 

We could also quicken the pace even more than it is in that example by abbreviating Hasan's reaction, like so:

&gt; They stood on the edge of the cliff and stared down at the water below. 
&gt;
&gt; ""We have to jump,"" Marie said. (character action)   
&gt;
&gt; Hasan stared at her in alarm. ""Are you kidding me?!"" (character reaction)   
&gt;
&gt; ""She looked back over her shoulder at the stampede bearing down on them. ""Jump. *Now!*"" Then, without waiting for his reply, she hurled herself over the edge.

This is how you can use character action and reaction to shape the pace of a particular moment.

##...whew! We made it to the end 

That was a lot of information, and honestly only a handful of the ways that you can use pace to impact narrative flow. What other ways do you like to use that I didn't mention? Let's share ideas with each other. &lt;3

##Workshop

Now here's the FUN part. The workshop element! If you want to participate, you can put your workshop entry in the comments below. You are free to share, regardless of whether you want me to put you in the workshop post next week. However, please make sure you tell me if you **don't** want to be critiqued in next week's post. (More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fgjpp1/ot_teaching_tuesday_plans_for_the_future/) if you're wondering what the heck I'm talking about.)

**Freewrite Prompt**: We just finished talking about ways to make your narrative flow fast or sloooow. Now, try to take this skeleton of a character interaction and decide if you want to speed it up or slow it down:

&gt; Davis said, ""There's not much else we can do.""   
&gt; ""There has to be.""   
&gt; ""There isn't.""   
&gt; ""How do you know if you don't try?""   
&gt; ""You're acting like I've never tried before.""

You can add as many words as you like anywhere you like--before, after, in between lines--as long as you keep those core lines. Try to use some of the concepts we talked about to add narrative action or language around the lines of dialogue to create either a fast, urgent interaction or a hesitant, elephant-in-the-room sort of heavy pause. **Word count limit: 250 words.**

Wozniak sounds like a completely normal, completely sane, highly intelligent engineer excited to have someone to talk to about the technical aspects of his inventions and creations. Terry Davis sounds like a paranoid schizophrenic(which he is) that thinks african american CIA agents glow in the dark, and that God speaks to him. Both of their technical skill is beyond reproach.

fjro7r,Jub7ir,[OT] HELP REQUIRED (PLEASE),"Hey talented fellas out there, I am a high school student of Qatar (Bangladeshi). Our exams are in 10 days or so and I really want to excel in it. My grammar is pretty okay but we all have generic writing styles as all of us read the same type of books and all teachers are from the same backgrounds so every writing style is usually the same. Almost 1.4 million students will appear in the exam. I really want something out of the box for writing to impress the teachers. A little help will be very helpful.

We have different types of formats and the prompts are quite easy. I want to know about writing the intro and ending, easy to use idioms and phrases and any tips regarding the formats.

We have to write :

1. E-mail
2. Paragraph
3. Composition
4. Letter

fjnds6,TenspeedGV,[OT] Spotlight: SugarPixel,"##Writers Spotlight
***********

This week's spotlight writer is **SugarPixel**

As most folks may know, I make it my policy that moderators can only be nominated for a Spotlight by non-moderators. I feel like it’s about as fair as it can be. It does mean we don’t get a lot of moderator Spotlights, but that’s okay. There’s a small number of us and there are so many good writers on this subreddit. It’s also my policy that I put up nominees in the order I receive them, and that more nominations move a writer higher on my list.

That’s why I was so thrilled to get so many nominations for u/SugarPixel. Though she has become much more active since joining the mod team, she has been writing for us off and on for years. She’s an excellent writer, and frankly she’s one of my favorite people on the subreddit and on our discord. She provides great advice, she is thoughtful, and she holds fast to what she views as right. Though we disagree on a number of things, I respect her a great deal and I’m happy that she’s a member of our community.

You can check out more of SP’s writing on her personal subreddit, r/PixelProse.

Congratulations, SugarPixel!

***********

Spotlight relies on your nominations. If you see a writer who has been around the sub for a while, who has at least six (or more!) high quality submissions, and who hasn't been given the Spotlight before, send us a modmail and let us know!

Recently, I came across this 3 year old prompt. I found that it did not have any replies, so I decided to try it out. This is my first time replying to a prompt so I hope you like it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

On a red eye flight bound for Bali, a man was browsing through the inflight entertainment system (IFE). The man's name was John Watson.

""Would you like to have some drinks?"" the flight attendant asked.

""I'll have some orange juice.""

After the flight attendant poured orange juice into a plastic cup and passed the cup to John, she continued walking down the aisle while pushing her cart. While sipping the orange juice, John recalled how he almost missed this flight. His direct flight from Frankfurt to Bali was cancelled at the last minute. He settled for a flight on Thai Airways that had a transit in Bangkok. Upon landing in Bangkok, he had to run through the huge airport concourse to reach the boarding gate for his flight to Bali. He arrived just in the nick of time before the gate closed.

The sound of the seat belt sign illuminating jolted him back to reality.

""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We are about to encounter some turbulence so please fasten your seat belts. Please remain seated until the seat belt sign is turned off. Thank you.""

John hastily put on his seat belts and continued looking through the IFE. Within minutes of the announcement, the airplane started to experience turbulence. The turbulence was occasionally accompanied by streaks of lightning outside the window. The turbulence rattled people out of the sleep.

Then, inexplicably, the plane began to rapidly tilt to the left. Passenger onboard the flight began experiencing increasingly discomfort. Eventually, the tilt was enough to cause the overhead compartment to open and all their contents fall out.

By then, the Boeing 777 aircraft was in a steep dive. The cabin was in chaos. There were people praying, there were people screaming. There were also couples holding hands in fear.

John closed his eyes and prayed silently.

\*\*\*

Meanwhile, at Kuala Lumpur Area Control Centre (KLACC), an air traffic controller noticed something odd on his radar. A Thai Airways 777 aircraft had just plunged 10000 feet in 1 minute.

He decides to radio over to the crew to check if there is anything wrong with the plane.

""Thai 712, confirm that you're cleared to flight level 350.""

""Standby!"" the frantic voice of the crew replied. In the background, loud audible warnings were heard.

""Thai 712, is everything okay?""

There was no answer.

\*\*\*

The pilot of the Thai Airways plane are frantically trying to control the plane.

""We're diving through 5000 feet! If this goes on, we will die!"" screams the first officer.

""Pull the yoke! Pull it with me!"" replies the captain with the same amount of panic in his voice.

The plane breaks through clouds. The ground below comes into view of the pilots.

""We're crashing! We're crashing!"" the first officer yells.

""Pull with me! We can get out of this!"" the captain replies.

But there is no more hope.

\*\*\*

The air traffic controller at KLACC has just realized that the Thai Airways plane has just vanished from his radar.

""Thai 712, radar contact lost. Thai Airways 712?""

He calls his supervisor and tells him the news.

Two warlords came together to wed their children, and the child of this union would eventually bring peace to the two armies. But on the eve of the day Fu Chang was to take his rightful place, he had an experience that changed his life.

He was taken to the land of Jianghu he I had many adventures. Before he returned home, he was granted guardianship of Sun Wukong's illegitimate son. Knowing his family would wish to exploit this child, he moved to America where he changed his name to Xuan Zang and opened up a restaurant.

As the child, whom he named Xuan Wukong grew, he began to show his monkey form, and Xuan Zang taught him to maintain a human form. Xuan Wukong began to be curious about the world around him, however, Xuan Zang was fearful that those around him would discover that Xuan Wukong wasn't human, and would exploit him, so he never allowed Wukong to leave their restaurant home, and even home schooled him.

One day, Xuan Zang's restaurant was visited by a small group of four kids. Jeffrey LaRusso, his girlfriend Emily Pierce and his two cousins, Michael Parker and Samuel Gabrewski. This was a tight-knit group and they went everywhere together. Xuan Wukong saw the four come into the restaurant and his curiosity was peaked. When they left, he followed them.

He found them playing basketball, and although he tried to remain hidden, they eventually saw him, and not knowing what he was, they invited him to play with them. This went on for several weeks until Xuan Wukong lost control of his human form and turned into a monkey form in front of his new friends. Scared, and not knowing what to do, he ran home.

The next day, Jeffrey and his friends returned to the restaurant to inquire about Xuan Wukong. When Xuan Zang saw that the four accepted Wukong despite knowing what he was, he decided to take the four in and train them in Kung Fu.

He first trained them to meditate, and to find their inner chi. When they did this, they found themselves with incredible powers. Jeffrey could become invisible, Samuel had the power of balance, Michael could make things blow up and Emily could levitate herself and others. Zang then taught the four and Wukong to control their powers and to use various forms of Kung Fu as befitting their animal that was revealed with their powers. Jeffrey was taught Snake, Samuel was taught Tiger, Michael was taught Dragon, Emily was taught Crane and Wukong was taught monkey.

When they had trained extensively in their respective powers and Kung Fu, they decided to venture out as a team and help those that needed them.",4,1584350696,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fji7e8/wp_the_circle/,WritingPrompts,1
fji6i0,PrinceMarvelOz,[OT] FanFictional Crossover Idea," 

I've been working on a fan-fictional story involving characters who have gone on journeys to other Fairy/Fantasy lands. I am wanting this story to be as accurate to the source material I am using them from as possible, as such they won't be using characters from different time periods. Even though this is fanfiction, it is a story that I would like to be able to eventually publish.

This story will be set during World War I era, and most of the characters would have finished their fantastic adventures.

The story will open with three characters, Zeb Hugson from ""Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz"", by L. Frank Baum; Rob Joslyn from ""The Master Key"", also by L. Frank Baum; and Alice Lee from A New Alice in the Old Wonderland, by Anna M. Richards. After having met at Nick Carter's Detective School, they would have come together to form their own detective agency. When one of the two men are drafted for the war, the other enlists and Alice helps with the medical staff. Also, Rob and Alice will be dating.

They will be sent over to the United Kingdoms where they will meet Digory Kirke, from The Chronicles of Narnia, by C.S. Lewis and John Darling, from Peter and Wendy, by J.M. Barrie, through these two they will eventually meet Digory's friend Polly Plummer and John's sister Wendy, with Zeb and Wendy eventually becoming a couple. (Michael will be featured but mostly in a reoccurring role, John is mainly a main character to give Zeb and Wendy a reason to meet.

I haven't really come up with a story itself quite yet, but possibly having the group go on adventures and revisiting the worlds they have gone to together.

Alice Liddell will eventually be featured, and will be brought in as Wendy's aunt, Mary Darling's older sister. She will be involved in a back story where she follows a white rabbit to an English Castle where she will have met Hank Morgan from Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Also, the younger Alice Lee will be a fan of the older Alice Liddell,

Another character that will be featured is Alice Lee's brother Billy. I have not yet read A New Alice in the Old Wonderland, which I need to, but depending on whether Billy is older or younger than Alice will depend on how I use him, If he is older, he will also be part of the Army as Zeb and Rob's commanding officer. If he is younger, he will be used the same as Michael Darling and maybe even become his best friend.",1,1584350541,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fji6i0/ot_fanfictional_crossover_idea/,WritingPrompts,1

He liked eating ass, he always did. He just was misunderstood.It was a dark day outside. A group of kids were wandering around when all of a sudden.￼”Hello, there” he whisperin their ass ed sillenty as the kids slowly turned around. They saw nothing but darkness at least thats what they thought it was a nibber in the darkness hiding with a 20 inch dill do. 
The group of kids ran around looking in fear as they moved, a friend of theirs popped out of the woods ”why￼￼ hello there” she said the group turned around to see if that thing was still watching them 
￼￼obama popped out behind them with a kfc buckket full of me cum but then they heard “Help” said 
Sans had popped out tied to a tree
And all you could see was the person who captured him 
Oh hello there 😂cutie wanna FUk
The kids being under age ran away in fear of their little tight butholees. Then fliing gorilla apeared.
Suddenly the gorilla mutiplied  bam bam they tripled quadropled and then there were 15 gorrilas hungry when suddenly they killed ev eryone exept everyone, but they didn’t knoe he robbed their nipples. Fliying gotilla flew aawai with his migical wings, but the kids waren’t going to give up. They grabbed their very horny migical unicorn and flew after the gotrilla and chased him down. All they COuld see was hiss big ASS.



￼
Then the griilla pulled out his gigant balls and sprayed his migical juice all over the CHILDREN. MOST of it got inside the very yung childan mouth. BUT THEY LIKED IT. so It didnt matter because they were stll hunfgry. And tHen the gotil;ka died
, and the they gnot their nipple s back and they were happy. Them 20 years litir pp came and it was national pp day where parents would feid their chaldren their tisticles until thei diie. And the once very tyung children died because of that. But then a migical hurse came and peed on them 
￼
But the horsee wasn't a nioirmal horse because as i mentioned he wias migical. But ythen he died because he had spayed all of his migical juice all over his ded children.




The END but not actually because i Liied and then yhe horsii came back but not actually becays ri lied again. But in another dimension the kids were not dead but they were smiking cigarrateds because they had lung cancer and that mide their testiicles very small like gavin size but they actually liked It being that small because in that dimension gavein was their Queen of LUVE v￼and they died because gaveine rap them. An d then gavins grandma appeared v
￼&lt;-- gavin grindma.

Andb spank hiim in his tiini ball sack an Gavein ded AF in the floor. Asnd she was a cannibal and she ate him.
￼
8=============================D The children survived but they only had like, I dunt knoe maybe like 1 HP so they hid inside theuir mums pussy.





20 yiirs later the kids came out with 100 HP vecause they cool like that.
But they die of ass nibbas.





Then It cums andd revives them with his gae migical balloon ￼ctrl+v

And they flie awae to a town nwear by with thee baloloons.


But they see obama likek 100 feet tall and he is eveil and tries to keel them. But lukili they have Gavins grandmi to eat him to death and rap him because she likes smooching him su hard..UwU


Reee came the black nibba from clash of clans.
￼ but the crazi black grandma kille s the hoggie. But nut actually because they usse na heeling potion tu revive his litte tighyt butholleee.





8=====D


Yihhe he sed the hoggies becaus ehe was happeie.
And then they were surronded by migical fliing dill dus lritng gorola
 You might think there dead but there not cause ethis is a magical dimesion that is diffrent from the other okay so lets get back to poop boy￼
Poop boy came out frum the bushies and started squirting all over the migicla creature. 
￼

They had made it back and were fighting frying gorrlias that had been brain washed luckly they had nigerain poop man to help them sadly they all got hiv and cancer also ebolo and also Corona virus from all the dirty poop from ppoop￼ man anyways they fought the gor￼rilas￼had FUSION￼ DANCE TRAN ￼tranSFORMing inTO MEGA GORRILA 
￼sadl￼y one of the nigeran children had been taken hostage  next to mega gotilla gorrila￼

The giant mega gorrila￼￼
Grabbed steve harveys balls and swallowed them cumpletely and his very harry balls werre stucke in his stomach.￼Mahhhh-Mahh-Mahhh-moud, sed the migical flying gotilla

Poop man melted in the sun
￼
Sadly poop mans time had come and all the kids left his rotting corpse in the sun after the gorrila had died by choking all the gorrilas forces retreted￼￼reated 

The kids went home satified with their day when all of a sudden…….(somebody do something go diego)
Robert Lanes came inside to their huses and rape their parent. The kids couldn’t don anything but watch while their parents enjoyed the sucking. Robert started sucking their very extra long pps and ran away to diegos house . 
Knock kmotherfuckernock  robert did diego opened the door to see robert with his very saggy testicles swinging around from side to side like a reqalay long ballsack
Roberts body died and the n it transformed inti sans and ppeed on the children to gain health back so he didn;t actiually die bvecause I like lying￼diego had been corned agaist a wall by robbert not knowing what to do he stared in his eyes ,￼ ￼~`        ￼


Then ballsack guy appeared with 100 HP and 100 Shield and grabbed roberts ballsack and ripped them out then he ate them and carried diego and walked inton then sunset vecause he gets all the hoes like that cause he GUCCI. 

The kiids watched while robert slowly bled out. Then Robert ded Af and died .

Then one of the kids got a very big boner and smaked the ball man so hurd in his chin testiis.

Magical balls sack man then did the ultimate dance and mad his balsack 1 million times bigger with the power of gavin's magical de ballsask juce.￼
Migigcal ball sac man than grabbed gaveinass ded bodi amd startded humping it to get all that goof nutrients out of gavins butiful body and lik it. 

Then once he was done he shaved his pewbs and them ate half of them and then fed the other ½ to the still alive children. It restored their life back to 100 percent and shield back to 10000 percentage.
Then thick boi retardo boy came inside the ballsack man and exploded hus thick big boii ass and then died because he gae and also forgot to mention gae. But his very thoick gae ass had planted a bomb insiode that was ready to explode in 100 years and it would do i dunt know ,maysbe like 1 hp damage because thic boi retardo forgot to actually set the timer.
￼Then all the childran have to go inside ball sacksa but hollee and ativate the bummb so he diy and dy.
The very thight yung childran went inside the ballsack man.

And exploded the bunmb and almost died but lukkily they had 10000 shield so they were able to sustain the power of the explosiion. 
The nigerian childran were all safE. AND THey were all doing their traditional nigerian dance.
             ￼
After all of that they died so it dosent matter.
Becausee the children turned out to be underage nigerian spies working for Osama Bin Laden which was revived by them during their traditional dance when they were alive.
And were plimming to bomb merica.

Yeh boii yu didn;t expect that lol retard because I saw it a mile away.
Ya yeet ur mom.

But then more underage nigerian children came to get revenge but they were hidiing in the sadows lol but ok.boomer.
￼￼


￼￼

But I foggot to mention that they were undercover underage asian-nigerian childran working for Osama Bin Laden so that means they hided in the shadows and also knew kungfu. So like they big brain so like ok boomer.

Thenn the kids atried sto stopp them but they couldn’t see them because they were invisible in the darkness. 



SO what the kids did was take out their pps and squirt their migical juce to be able to detect them from the dark.
“My pp senses their skin of the color of the shit” said one of the kids and then they attacked. One of the childs got a big boner and smaked the nigerian child in his face with his very hard pp made of steel.                                                                                      


Byut theb Hitler appeared, and then all teh childern kneiled dowm in honor of their god. “Fuhrer” said one of the children, “let me suck on tour toes to please your needs” said one of the children.
Since in their dimension children ate soo many toes it was normial and alsio veri legal so p;s don’t think is not because it is very legal. For childran to eat tos. The fuhrer was very thicc luking.
￼because of all the juws he had aten in hell for a very lung time.
The children joined forces to fight the evil asian nigerian isis ninjas that worked for OSama bIN LadeN because hsi army was so powerful but not powerful enough to defear hitler.

Hitler had a big ass booner so he used that to hsi advantage and sprayed his migical juce so the children would drink it and they would receive 10000 million hp. And then the children did that so they would become almust immortal. 

But then andrew Alergia, the nigerian prinx, appeared.


￼
Andrew came and said that thaty hitler was an impostor and that he was their actual god. DNa tHE kids looked at andrew and knew there was no chance he was kying, I mean look at his face, that is the face of only a god can bare.

The children had gaimed a lot of hp into thei advantage so thas guud. But then the ninjis appeared again and tried to murder them so the kids took out their big boners and killed every single one of them by raping them.

Then Nigerian prince andrew was in his very nice lookin bikini but his toes were BRoKE n so he couldn´t’ fight at one hundred percent.

But then butiful Nigerian prince andrew summoned his migigcal staff called dick black, which had the power to create and distroy life.

￼(UwU)&lt;-(ooowowowowo)owowowowowowowowowowowuw

fjgk2a,lord_of_worms,[RF] The Zombie apocalypse is approaching..,"The zombie apocalypse is approaching - the reanimation of a corpse has been possible for some time, but is unsustainable with the effect running its course and ending. In order for maintained reanimation of any corpses, an underlying biological infrastructure needs to be installed into the host for the ""zombie"" effect to activate and become permanent.

The key is ensuring host contamination is swift, and non alarming. Confusion and panic are supporting plans if the initial release is detected, to obfuscate its purpose.

First will be the delivery - an airborne virus should work quite well crossing country borders in vehicles and passengers alike. This method also takes advantage of high-density population where many people share close breathing space, so perhaps a tourist destination would help avoiding alarm.

To avoid true detection, the symptoms could appear benign, or even familiar by replicating those of the common Flu - coughing also adds to the contagious aspect.

The second phase will activate the underlying bio-infrastructure creating what would commonly be recognised as a zombie.  The initial phase is all infrastructure - there is no requirement it be lethal, but any fatalities are bonus. any surviving infected will retain the genetic marker required for activation.   


We will name this new virus delivery system ""Corvid-19"", the zombie apocalypse is approaching..",4,1584340745,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fjgk2a/rf_the_zombie_apocalypse_is_approaching/,WritingPrompts,1

---

The second time I met Erica was in the winter of Year 8. She was--unlike many others--surviving on her own at that point. I found her tucked in a cave in the mountains, not far from a brook where the glacial water flowed in when the weather warmed and a spring where hot water bubbled from the earth all year. In the cave, she had stocks of meats and warm hides.
 
I found her whittling a branch down to a spear. 

I found her humming an old tune under her breath. A melody I’d long forgotten.

I found her wrapped in fur that looked like a wolf’s skin. Her thin blonde hair was pulled back in a tight braid, with whisps loose around her head. They reminded me of the whites of flame. At the time, she was thin (thinner than most adults would ever be in their life) but her cheeks were round and her hands steady as she set her blade against the wood. Her arms weren’t weak--the sinew of her muscle flexed when she pulled the knife down. 

Erica did not need my help. She was young--but not young enough to be stupid--and ex-military. She did not need my help. Not like the others did. 


The third time I found Erica was in the fall of Year 10. She was in an abandoned house near a town once called Greenwater. Washington State. Overgrown grass and brush obscured the house from the road, and the road was not (and had never been) a main route. Those who had tried followed this road further, the ones back in the early years, found only washout asphalt and a river wider than their maps showed. 

Erica had not known about the washout. She had hoped to follow highway 410 down to Mount Rainer. The last time she’d spoken to Saul, he’d mentioned a group of survivors that had set up camp there. She would never know if that was true. 

The third time I found Erice, she had her hands wrapped around her gun. Barrell to skin. A tremor worked its way through her arm. She pulled the trigger. 

I stopped the bullet before it fired. 


“You’re an asshole,” Erica whispered. Her eyes fluttered open and focused straight ahead. 

I paused and considered her. She shouldn’t have known I was there. But then Erica was never one to follow conventions. 


“Don’t give me that,” she said. She shuffled onto her feet and dropped her shotgun at her feet. “I know you’re here. I can *feel* you.” 


She was not meeting my eyes, but her gaze landed where I stood. The last time I saw Erica, she was fire. It was the only reason she had survived so long. 

“I’ve felt you here before. Following me around,” she sighed. 

Erica was cold today. Her eyes sunk into her skeletal face, framed by a broken halo of hair. At some point, she’d loped the braid off with a pair of kitchen scissors. Her left pinky and ring fingers were twisted and wrapped with blackened tape. This house did not suit her. 

“I heard rumours about you. Saul told me he felt you last spring--when he was sick. He said he was lying there, wishing for it to all be over, and then he felt a coolness spread down his spine. Told me he thought it was death, finally here to take away the pain. 

“But the darkness he waited for didn’t come. He could just *breath* again, and walked away from his death bed like it was only a head cold.”


Erica pulled a threadbare blanket--her warm fur lost to the mud somewhere outside Portland--around her thin shoulders. The wind railed against the wall and blew through the shattered rear window. “A few years back we were dropping like flies. All of us survivors--people who were smart and capable of living through the first wave--were just falling. Six years ago there were thousands of survivors. I could barely get through a small town without having to hide from looters. And then three years ago I didn’t come across a single person in all of Vancouver.”


Eric was ice. Her voice rattled in her throat. It was true, though. Even the survivors could not hold back the tides. I am the only one who can. 


“No one has died since winter of Year 9.”

That statement was correct. 

“Saul said that you were life. But I don’t think that’s true. Life knows when to let go."" Erica’s head slumped forward. Her body shook with a sob. “I want to go.”


*No*.


“Please,” she whispered, “Just let me leave.”

Maybe--if I was kinder--I would have let her slip into the ether. But I had myself to consider. The story doesn’t start with Erica. It doesn’t start with her, or with the waves of fires, or even with Saul or with the preacher. 

The story--or my story--started hundreds of thousands of years ago. Back when humans first started to gather and meet and pray. Back when someone decided to draw a line between the living and the dead and decided that their needed to be someone to bridge that gap.

Erica’s story, however, starts seven years before the end. The first time I met Erica, she was fifteen. She stood next to her mother, the two of them clad in black dresses for the funeral of Xavier Reed, their cleaner’s son. Erica’s mother, Annalise, insisted they show their support. Throughout the whole ceremony, Erica pulled at the end of her dress, desperate to make it longer. 

From there, things unwound rapidly. Faster than most had predicted. It wasn’t until Year 7 when I realized I would soon put myself out of business. 

As I watched Erica, hollow and defeated, in the rundown house in what was once Greenwater, Washington, I knew it was far from the last time I would see the woman. I had plans for Erica. There weren’t many more people out there. But they had to make it. I would ensure their survival. Erica needed to make it to the coast. She needed to find Nia and the preacher. She needed to live. 

What was my purpose at this time but to become life? Could their have been a true distinction? 

I was not keen to die any time soon. And I would not bring anyone into darkness again.",9,1584325471,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fjdfje/piyou_are_death_but_in_a_postapocalyptic_world/,WritingPrompts,1

fj6tvc,PrinceMarvelOz,[WP] FanFictional Crossover Story Idea," 

I've been working on a fan-fictional story involving characters who have gone on journeys to other Fairy/Fantasy lands. I am wanting this story to be as accurate to the source material I am using them from as possible, as such they won't be using characters from different time periods. Even though this is fanfiction, it is a story that I would like to be able to eventually publish.

This story will be set during World War I era, and most of the characters would have finished their fantastic adventures.

The story will open with three characters, Zeb Hugson from ""Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz"", by L. Frank Baum; Rob Joslyn from ""The Master Key"", also by L. Frank Baum; and Alice Lee from A New Alice in the Old Wonderland, by Anna M. Richards. After having met at Nick Carter's Detective School, they would have come together to form their own detective agency. When one of the two men are drafted for the war, the other enlists and Alice helps with the medical staff. Also, Rob and Alice will be dating.

They will be sent over to the United Kingdoms where they will meet Digory Kirke, from The Chronicles of Narnia, by C.S. Lewis and John Darling, from Peter and Wendy, by J.M. Barrie, through these two they will eventually meet Digory's friend Polly Plummer and John's sister Wendy, with Zeb and Wendy eventually becoming a couple. (Michael will be featured but mostly in a reoccurring role, John is mainly a main character to give Zeb and Wendy a reason to meet.

I haven't really come up with a story itself quite yet, but possibly having the group go on adventures and revisiting the worlds they have gone to together.

Alice Liddell will eventually be featured, and will be brought in as Wendy's aunt, Mary Darling's older sister. She will be involved in a back story where she follows a white rabbit to an English Castle where she will have met Hank Morgan from Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Also, the younger Alice Lee will be a fan of the older Alice Liddell,

Another character that will be featured is Alice Lee's brother Billy. I have not yet read A New Alice in the Old Wonderland, which I need to, but depending on whether Billy is older or younger than Alice will depend on how I use him, If he is older, he will also be part of the Army as Zeb and Rob's commanding officer. If he is younger, he will be used the same as Michael Darling and maybe even become his best friend.",6,1584300160,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fj6tvc/wp_fanfictional_crossover_story_idea/,WritingPrompts,1

“Now Podlings, our history module we will be learning today is about a disease that hit the world in 2020, that’s 100 years ago! Does anyone know about the pandemic of 2020?”
“Yes Teacher! I do! It’s when something called torlet paper and hard stuff made from flour and water mixed together was rationed and then became extinct like the dinosaurs!”
“Very good! The hard stuff made from flour and water you mentioned was actually called “paaaarstar” that our ancestors consumed over many years that originated from a country called Italy, that is now known as “The No Area” and was heavily consumed over the many months of the pandemic. So much so that it stopped being produced in 2021.”
“Teacher, did they not have douches in their houses like we do? Did they really use paper to wipe their bottoms?”
Yes, they did! But back then douches were something only a small amount of countries were accustomed to. Our ancestors did in fact use paper to wipe their bottoms, but again because of the pandemic of 2020 and the overconsumption of “toilet paper”, people had to source alternative methods to clean their rumps with. Socks became a common use alternative but in 2022 douches became a thing all houses then required and that is why we all have douches in our homes today!” 
“Isn’t that where The Hand Washing song came from Teacher?”
“Yes! You are right!

fj2kpa,Cody_Fox23,[CW] Smash 'Em Up Sunday: Ides of March,"#**Welcome back to Smash ‘Em Up Sunday!**

&amp;nbsp;


##Last Week

&amp;nbsp;

Writers. My sweet writers. You had me worried that I wasn’t going to even have three submissions to choose from this week. The late week push was so happy to see, and well worth the wait! You all came out swinging hard and put out some great micromysteries that worked in the size constraint, but could also be well fleshed out. 

This became a hard fought battle, and I highly recommend anyone reading this to go back and [check out all the stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/ffec5m/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_agatha_christie/) regardless of my choices. It was one of the strongest SEUS showings I can think of.

On a sidenote, shoutout to /u/Susceptive for getting a nice crit circle going. If I didn’t know better I would have thought it was one of /u/Leebeewilly’s Feedback Friday posts, and I am here for it.

It makes my cold mod heart proud &lt;3

&amp;nbsp;

####Cody’s Choices:

&amp;nbsp;

First up, I owe y’all some Seuss SEUS choices:

* /u/FatDragon - [Last Journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fbw0m8/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_dr_seuss/fj7ziig/)

* /u/JohnGarrigan - [Ode to Seuss](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fbw0m8/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_dr_seuss/fj8setd/)

* /u/ShyLightning - [Blue Poiloog](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fbw0m8/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_dr_seuss/fjg9tmr/)

&amp;nbsp;

Christie SEUS Choices:

* /u/Susceptive - [Little Miss-tea-rious](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/ffec5m/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_agatha_christie/fk309ui/)

&amp;nbsp;

##This Week’s Challenge

&amp;nbsp;

[Beware the Ides of March](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fhashtag%2Fjuliedontgo%3Flang%3Dda&amp;psig=AOvVaw3Qxkey9lqbbqNlxuhRM6we&amp;ust=1584370180610000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLDgsf7cnOgCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAU)!

I couldn't resist considering it is today and all! :D

This is going to be a laidback oldschool style SEUS. I’ll lay out some constraints and you can write whatever meets them. No weird wordcounts. No authors to emulate. Just a good old-fashioned do-as-you please story with the bits and pieces I give you. 

Have fun!
