fsobqr,batterycrayon,Why are the treaties between the United States and Native Americans so poorly enforced?,"One element is that Native Americans don't have a lot of political power, the public isn't well informed on the issues, and there isn't much political will. That's not the kind of ""why"" I mean.

What I want to know is more mechanical, I guess. When treaties are broken, aren't there supposed to be consequences? Don't other countries usually witness/cosign these things? Is there no international law about this kind of stuff? I suppose other countries consider it an internal problem rather than an international one? Setting aside the issues of power and political will for a second, is there a mechanism by which these treaties should be enforced, some body that is supposed to be compelling the US to act right?

I know some lawsuits within the US have happened, but isn't the whole point of these treaties that they recognize the sovereignty of the Native Americans? So surely there is some sort of international court that should be addressing these grievances?

Are there other examples of countries ignoring this kind of obligation and facing no consequences on the international level?

fsnxo9,AssaultEagle,I’m a 30 year old man with an unfulfilling yet well paid job and set of skills,"Hi guys 

Hoping some of the sages amongst you will be able to help. 

I’m currently a successful IT developer (I specialise in MS Office integration, mostly via VBA and SQL - self-taught). I’ve come to a bit of an impasse in life. I hate the company I work for, it’s a huge company that pays very well but is more than chaotic and terribly organised. I’ve lost any faith working with them long term. 

The issue I have is that most of my skills lie within the MS Office environment. I have a really deep understanding of VBA and MS Office integration but have no idea how this fits into anything but very niche roles.

I’ve had 4 years of business analysis experience and 18 months of experience as an IT project manager, but have no idea where to go from here.

The main issue is I’m finding IT to be unfulfilling, any ideas where I could potentially transfer these skills?

I asked the sister, are people going to be working from home now instead of the 2 weeks?

The response: Well what do you think?? 

My response: Well, the majority of people thought or assumed it was only going to go on for 2 weeks. Is your work doing something similar now?

The response: You see people are still working from home right? What about you, what did YOU initially thought?

My response: People assumed that it must've only been for 2 weeks... 

The response: No I asked YOU, what did you think? 

*I suddenly suspect a trap, though I'm also a bit persuaded by the 2 weeks gossip that has been circling around, I didn't want to answer directly because it's some trick she likes to use. I initially didn't care if it's 2 or more weeks... And I thought it would make me stupid if I engage either way*

My response: Well we can say that I thought people assumed that it must only go on for 2 weeks

The response: Why should I answer your question, on behalf of my work then. I asked you, what do you think!?

My response: Well I did answer, and my answer is that I thought people assumed that it must've gone for 2 weeks. Is your work now doing it indefinitely? 

*I forgot to include that most workplaces are now doing it since a mandate was extended to April 30. I was simply curious if her workplace is also doing it or if they're indefinite with it*

The response: You don't want to answer my question, I'm not going to answer yours

*The person now opts to ignore and have put their headphones on*

My response: See that's what you do when you.. think you lost a discussion... 

The response: Oh no, there's no dealing with you. It's hard to come to a conclusion with you

My response: But that's what you do! You refuse to engage or answer when there's a good response

The response: See, that's what I've been trying to tell you. Are you stealing what I've been trying to say all along?

My response: ...... Then this is the way it's like trying to discuss something with you!

fsn0ui,Project_Durden,Can you snag/grab objects with a bullwhip?,"This question was posted 4 years ago, and never properly answered. So I'm going to explain the physics and mechanics of this  art. 

Firstly, Yes. You can grab objects with a bullwhip, and bring them to yourself. 

It's not the easiest thing to do. Until you're used to it of course. 
The basic method to do this, is to ""crack"" the whip on the object, then use a little extra momentum to pull the object back to yourself. 

How it's done: 
The cracker needs to exert all the momentum out, that it had when it cracked on the object - so that it has time to wrap around it, while there's a brief instance of steady tension on the entire whip. 

When you get the proper feel of it happening, you can then give a quick (but gentle) tug on the handle and retrieve the object. 

If the object is too big for the cracker to completely wrap around it, then you you simply need to make sure that the whip has completely exerted all the kinetic energy, and has the proper tension all the way back to the handle... 

So. There you are! The way to accomplish this fun and amazing feat, of using a whip.... To grab an object and bring it back to you!",0,1585694191,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fsn0ui/can_you_snaggrab_objects_with_a_bullwhip/,NoStupidQuestions,2

fsmmad,melodyofdawn,"Found a Walmart item scam. What do I do to protect myself, and NOT fuck over the next person at the same time?","So, I bought a WD BLUR 500GB SSD (solid state drive) for my laptop at Walmart. It was full price at $65, sold from a case (the kind that requires and employee with key to grab it) and not “open box” or any such thing. 

Got home, opened the box to see that it was taped closed with a regular roll tape and looks like it has been opened. Thought nothing of it. Installed. While installing, noticed ridges on the main sticker on the device that looked like sticker was previously removed. Got suspicious, but moved on. Turned on the laptop, found that its actually a 150GB SSD, not 500 at all. 

At this point I’m slightly furious, because Im starting to realize that someone replaced the actual 500GB drive with a 150GB drive and returned it to Walmart without suspicion to get a free component, which obviously got put back on the floor. 

I need to return it (still good for 11 more days) because I just literally got scammed, but if I tell them the truth- Im almost certainly going to be accused of being the scammer and replacing the device. However if I say nothing, Im definitely fucking over the next person who buys it, and I would really, REALLY like to avoid that. I don’t want to be an asshole. 

So... what do I do...? Should I just say “something is wrong it doesnt work” so they send it to be refurbished...? How do I prevent them from putting it back out on the floor (clearly AGAIN) but not getting into a massive shit ton of trouble???",39,1585692892,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fsmmad/found_a_walmart_item_scam_what_do_i_do_to_protect/,NoStupidQuestions,3

Does anyone know if you can do that in the State of Georgia? (Or have him turn in a form?)

P.s. He isn't an official truck driver per se but he delivers the truck from the truck manufacturing company and delivers it to the other companies that need it. He's been working there for years if that means anything.

Is it implying there was some kind of mind control drug *in* the kool-Aid?

I've always found the metaphor confusing, because in the real event, everyone who drank the kool-aid immediately died.

fsksul,d0o_o0b,"How do you know when your statistical analysis, and the conclusions you reach from it, aren't bullshit?","*I've never studied stats or probability and I suck at mathematics.*

Say I come up with a question, such as ""success differences in obtaining employment between those whose surnames begin with a consonant and those which begin with a vowel"" and I do a survey of 10,000 people and divide them into two groups according to their surnames' initial, then I measure how many job interviews they've had where they were rejected versus where they were hired and collate it all into a nice table.

There has gotta be *some* difference between those two groups' job hunting success, but the difference can't possibly be because of the spelling of their surnames. There are so many factors that go into getting a job that even if the first letter of the surnames were part of it, it would surely be a tiny part, so despite the nice table with the genuine data in it, the study is pretty worthless and you can't say ""well, it looks like there's a sightly higher chance of being hired if your name has a soft vowel as its initial"" or whatever the case may be.

When I see articles describing studies along those lines, which I'm sure are legit and not bullshit like my example, I nonetheless have no idea how to evaluate their legitimacy because they all sound as vulnerable-to-being-bullshit as the one I came up with above, and so goes the lament of the uneducated drop-out i.e. me.

I said I didn't know, and that it seemed like there was a lot of confusing among the people who define it (as I was looking through the Wikipedia page). Being someone born in the Spring of '96, I was in class with people born anywhere between the summer of '95 (and earlier in a few outliers) and the summer of '96 (again with a few outliers). I feel it would make more sense for me to be in the same generation as the people of '95 and '96, since those are people I regularly associated with growing up and still do to this day. With that said, I've seen definitions of Gen Z starting anywhere from '93-'97. Being born in that range, it's a little confusing, and now I'm seeing all these posts about ""how it's Gen Z who's going on Spring Break and ruining the curve."" While most of those people probably are Gen Z (considering someone born in '97 would be (turning) 23 this year), it's made me wonder yet again if there's a largely-agreed-upon birthyear.

My guesses:  The N1H1 took its toll over a longer period of time, instead of all at once.

It was not as easily transmitted from person to person.

fsihly,ResponsiblePair5,How to fix Safari on Reddit accidentally posting same post twice?,"Basically, I have an iPhone 6s on iOS 10.0.1. I used to jailbreak my phone but now I don't because it's gotten too complicated. Well I leave my phone on 10.0.1 for a while then suddenly I try to update it and now I can't update it to the latest one. I can't plug it in the computer cause a gas station charger I bought, broke my jack and now it can only charge through the large white USB apple box and nothing else.

Reddit on the APP Store needs you to have a certain iOS (which is way above mine I believe) and I can't get it so a I use Reddit on Safari (oh I forgot to mention, I had the Reddit app but deleted it to get memory really quick and I didn't realize it requires a certain iOS) . This is extremely buggy and I don't know if it's my phone or another underlying reason but it glitches out randomly like the aforementioned posting twice out of nowhere. I can't seem to delete posts on Safari as when I try to delete it, it only shows that I can Edit it and that's about it. I've done this multiple times on a different account which I posts stuff for a particular Reddit and I feel as if it comes off as annoying and will probably get me banned. Thing is, the accidental posts happen randomly. 

Does anyone happen to have any alternative solutions or am I screwed? Thanks everyone.

fshmg5,870SWMAN,"What causes a person to always think he is brilliant, everyone is incompetent, he's saving everyone, and no one appreciates him?","I've got a family member who seems to have these ideas constantly running through his head. It's like a compulsion than he just can't resist. He's always got to be on the tip of the spear, he's always got to be in control, he needs to think he's doing way more than you, he has to one up you, he's helping everyone, he's selfless, hes everyone's savior etc.


For example say the family comes together to talk about a situation or a problem and how to solve it. It's never an equal conversation with an equal exchange. He's always dominating the meeting and he always has to say something smarter and more brilliant thank you. Usually it's a dumb comment. It almost seems like he needs to feel that he's one upped you. He doesn't care about what anyone else has to say.


So say the family comes to a consensus on how to tackle a problem or situation together. If the solution or course of action isn't this family members solutuon he is angry and resentful. Like clockwork he basically says ""fuck everyone else"" and goes about ""solving"" the problem on his own. He does it all sneaky. It seems like he wants to surprise everyone and he wants everyone to clap and praise him.


It seems this person doesn't really care what the best solution is. He cares that other people are solving it and that pisses him off. It also pisses him off to simply be a soldier or a cog in the wheel or work in collaboration with everyone else. He just can't do that. He can't take a backseat and let others lead. If you tell him to do something or follow a plan or procedure he either won't do it or he needs to put his own spin or modification on it to make it ""better.""


Inevitably he fucks everything up and the other family members get angry at him for doing things on his own, not following the plan, and not working with everyone else. He can't understand why people are mad at him. He always say shit like ""why are you getting mad? I'm doing this to help you. Don't you want me to help me? No one appreciates me. Everyone is incompetent and I needed to step in and actually fix it. Your solution was flawed and I saw the trainwreck coming.""

fsh6x1,Danield10c,"Can I be charged with a crime of ""Breaking and Entering"" if I never entered and just opened and unlocked door?","I'm in a situation right now where a business owner is threatening to charge me with ""breaking and entering"" for opening an unlocked door. The background story is I hired somebody to work on an RV for me. This guy had a business and looked legit so we agreed he would do the job. He then asked for part of the payment, which included the purchase of a water heater, and we agreed I would pay the rest when I recieved the RV. He took longer than he had initially stated and finally turned in the RV about two months after he took it. When finally turning it in he claimed he still had minor roof work to do on it, but that he would come back and finish it and that he had gone ""above and beyond"" what we paid him. From what I saw it was okay so I paid him the remainder of the amount and decided to wait for him to finish the minor details since they weren't essential to the use of the RV. I heard from him once the following two weeks asking if I had moved it and nothing else. After those two weeks we were finally prepping it for use and moved it to where we could test the water and electricity and so on, and as soon as we turned the water on we discovered the water heater was just missing. I called and he answered and immideatley said ""I know why you're calling, I forgot to install the water heater but I will go install it."" I told him I desperately needed it done by the begining of the following week and he agreed to fix it before then. Almost every day he would state he was on his way than just not show up. When I would call and text he would ignore it until the end of the day where he would say he didn't get time to come. Finally on the Sunday, the day before I needed it done, I had had enough of him ignoring calls and texts and decided I would visit his business location posted on google maps and see if I could at least get my water heater and have someone else install it. When I was arriving I received a text stating he had gone with some family member to do some emergency errands and wouldn't be able to go finish the job that day. I called him multiple times and no answer. When I arrived I realized his business was simply a yard with an RV in the middle of it, and I saw his vehicle was there so I decided to knock. The neighbors also indicated his truck was there so he should be there at which point I thought he was hiding from me. At that point when I knocked I noticed the door was unlocked and opened it to see if he was in there but never actually went into the RV. Turns out the RV wasn't his office, it was his home. Nobody was there except a puppy so I closed the door, waited an hour then left. Later he calls me telling me he's got me on camera opening his door and that he has filed a police report so I can be charged with breaking and entering ""if he wanted to press charges."" He then also claimed I did't shut the door correctly and his puppy escaped and was lost. This I think is a load of horse shit because I waited there an hour and the door never opened and casually he stated the puppy cost him just above the price I paid him for the water heater. At this point Im thinking smalls claims court is gonna be my only option but I want to know if I can be charged with breaking and entering into his RV which for all I knew was his office not his home, or if he could charge me for the lost puppy.

fsgp6l,Ion_D-worth,What are the best types of animations to make to grow an intentionally bad 3D animation channel?,"In the past 5 years or so, there have been a lot of channels getting big by making 3D animations that are made to look bad on purpose (some examples: Surreal Entertainment, Pamtri, Cyber 8, AndyWilson92, RobenSikk, Wetzelmation, and CreamWorks Animations.) About 2 years ago, I saw some of them and got inspired to make my own intentionally bad 3D animation channel.

Some of these channels went from 0 to 100,000 subscribers in just a few months. But I've been uploading frequently for about 6 months and still haven't made it past 200. I know you need to get lucky to grow that quickly, but I'm thinking that maybe people don't find my videos interesting or funny enough.

When making intentionally bad 3D animations, there are 3 choices. You can make animations based on trending memes, you can make animations that are parodies of video games, movies, and TV series, or you can make animations with your own original characters, stories, and worlds.

I've tried making meme animations, but I'm not that good at staying up to date with trending memes. I've tried parody animations, but those got boring quickly. I'm trying original animations, but it takes forever to model the characters, develop the stories, and create the worlds (I've spent almost 2 months just trying to get one character's face to not look weird), leaving my subscribers waiting for more animations.

I'm currently focusing on original animations, but I'll still occasionally make some meme and parody animations. Which type of animations would help me grow my channel the most?",2,1585674272,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fsgp6l/what_are_the_best_types_of_animations_to_make_to/,NoStupidQuestions,1

You get it. So, what are your thoughts? On a basic level, emotions work as punishments/rewards in response to our own behavior and to me it appears that all we do is to feel better, to feel more ""happy"" and to avoid feeling ""bad"". It's always about us.

Even if the deed might seem selfless such as donation/helping people, etc - we still do it to feel better. Like, I might donate some money because I feel guilty of having so much while some people have so little - meaning I do it for myself, to get rid of that feeling, of feeling selfish because I don't help other people - but ultimately it's a selfish deed.",17,1585672252,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fsg2dq/are_all_people_inherently_selfish/,NoStupidQuestions,2

One thought is to buy a storage container and put heat insulation inside, at least i think it would be a very cheap good alternative.

fseeml,Cheebow,"Does this happen to anyone else? I seem to ""sort"" numbers and letters into a specific arrangement in my head.","This is really hard to explain so I'll draw some pictures to better explain it.

https://imgur.com/gallery/vSI8bmB

So for numbers, 1-10 is in a straight line. 11-20 is 90° adjacent to 1-10. 20-29, 30-39, etc. Then goes in a straight line like 1-10, but they stack upon eachother. Negatives are the exact same as positives, just mirrored and the ""area"" they are in is very dark.
(Note: the eyes with the lines are the angles i most commonly view the numbers)


https://imgur.com/gallery/Us1jJCS

When it comes to bigger numbers, they come in chunks, pretty simple. The angles sort of correspond with the 1-10/11-20/20-29 pattern, where they are 90° adjacent to eachother. Depending on the situation in which i am thinking about numbers, they may count by 1,000s, 10,000s, 100,000s, etc. I usually view them upsidedown from how i drew it. Going higher up in value makes the ""area"" seem both darker and lighter at the same time.


https://imgur.com/gallery/eue67BS

Letters are interesting. A-H is a normal line, but it takes a sharp 90° turn at H, going down until around R-S, where is curves back into a regular line. Once the line turns 90°, so does the angle at which i view them, in which i view them as if they were just a normal horizontal line.

Someone said this could be a form of synesthesia but i wasn't sure if this counted since it doesnt really involve colors/tastes/smells, etc.

Is there an actual name for this? Does this happen to anyone else?

Edit:

Heres how i view months and years

She says the reason is that she listened to music too much when she was young, but maybe she just isn't aware if this happening.

Basically, I want to find out more info about when the whole thing happened, etc. Does the whole thing have a name or wiki page? I searched on Google but didn't really know what to write (""that thing where music companies made their music louder""??). So I thought a human response might help me.

With an apple wafch, obviously those things you can do. Do apple watches connect to your phone with Bluetooth like the Fitbit does, or do you have to have a whole cellular plan for the watch? I’m asking because I was planning on buying one used (most like a series 3 or something) or buying one off amazon and if I have to make a whole other plan to use it, I’m not going to get it.

Will the car be slower on empty battery? The Porsche is a plug-in hybrid. Do we have to charge it home to maintain the full power or can we skip it and count on ICE taking care of that?

My new roommate is a morning pooper. Not a big fan of this to be honest, as I have to use the washroom in the mornings, but if I get in there before him it’s fine. However, I’ve found myself needing to poop earlier and earlier in the day, despite the fact that nothing else has changed. I was pooping at work after lunch, and then I was pooping soon after getting into the office. Eventually I was pooping in the morning before leaving for work.

fs9d8k,RobertPaulson4,CARES Act (HR 748) just passed. It appears people who have recently exhausted unemployment can now reapply. Is this correct?,"So looking at the final signed CARES Act, Section 2102 states...

So let's say I exhausted my UI benefits on 1/1/2020 and have been seeking work and been able to work since then, with no luck finding a job, mostly due to the pandemic and the crash of the oil/gas industry which caused my initial layoff, am I reading this right that I could reapply for new benefits and receive benefits [starting from 1/27/2020](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text#H740A0B948EC94A639C64C70EECD143AE)? And it looks like I can receive up to 39 weeks of benefits. And I think I read that there's a [$600 weekly bonus](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text#H211538351C124AECAAA3AFFE0E8397A4) that will run up [until 7/31/2020](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text#HD6D90F5F68FA45C0A12410C83C72680C)?

I've not been sick with C19, nor am I taking care of anyone with it. I was laid off in June of last year. I'm not available to telecommute. I have had lots of job prospects shut down hiring and then shut down their facilities. I just want to make sure I understand my eligibility for these benefits before I call them tomorrow.

What are my options to end this insanity?","Ok, so here's some background info about me to establish some context. I like to think of myself as relatively tech literate, as I do work as a software engineer, and I've always been paranoid about sharing my information with anyone unless absolutely necessary. Lately, my paranoia and consequential preventive measures have only grown, and I cannot think of a slip-up at all that I made which caused this.    

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly believe this was entered by another person, because about 90% of the text messages have a specific person's name in them as the apparently intended recipient, and it's not mine.     

&amp;#x200B;

Some more info:    

   

The text messages themselves are obviously sketchy, with URLs I wouldn't dare click and promises that I've won an iPhone or some vague gift.    

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Each one of these text messages comes from a different number. There is only one instance in which the same number was used twice for this. I'm assuming a service such as Twilio is being used to generate these texts, but this is probably skewed by my experience writing auto-response text systems for a former employer.    

&amp;#x200B;

This all started in the middle of February, the week after I visited a doctor when I had the Flu. Along with text message spam, I initially was called dozens of times a day by completely different phone numbers. The few times they left a voicemail message, it was an obvious recording, often with a software-produced voice that was deep in the uncanny valley. Thankfully, these phone calls have stopped, but the text messages continue daily.",3,1585640575,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fs8qf1/someone_else_i_assume_entered_my_phone_number/,NoStupidQuestions,1

fs8l8f,Mnopas,You tell me if this is stupid and I’ll believe you. Covid 19,"I’m going to ask a stupid question at least you might think so me not so much.  
I have a brother in quarantine with Covid 19 symptoms.  He has been tested and the results are 8 days away.  Which in itself is ridiculous.   
It seems to me that everything is backwards.  
Hospitals are jammed, no vents, no masks and test being done on people who covid 19 would be evident by CT scan if already hospitalized
Why are people being quarantined and not medicated?   Positive or negative.  

Seems to me if those that are just beginning with signs of Covid 19 rather then telling them drink , rest take NyQuil or Tylenol and keep them isolated for 14 days 8 of which are spent probably becoming sicker or on the verge of being on ventilators while waiting on these tests.  They should be given the meds while they are strong enough to be able to use them in conjunction with being almost healthy.  I’m not saying to use it as a prophylactic only when  symptoms not a 3rd phase symptom a first phase symptom  is present 
Hospitalized patients need medication not testing and they need to swap out all of the ruling out Covid 19  for other respiratory diseases and treat Covid 19 as if everyone with symptoms had it. 

Quarantine those at home with medication. Not time to become sicker.  This may take the weight off of the healthcare system, vents gloves etc as at first light they rule in Covid 19 medicate and then if it fails rule in anything else it could be.   
Testing asymptomatic patients with test kits used on the thousands of people in the hospital that could be ruled in first ruled out later. Asymptomatic patients could be quarantined is they test positive do they are not just running around passing it on. 
I mean really how many people who have gone to the hospital on there last legs are effectively dying from being in quarantine  too long with zip treatment.    Even if the meds are new treatment for and unknown it has been shown to be effective in many.  .  
In my mind it says treat first, test second.  If hospitalized used a.  CT scan.   
I was in medical field forever they will never catch up if asymptomatic patients aren’t screened.  And more people will die as a cause of not ruling Covid 19 before it beats your system down.  In this they could treat at home quarantine and then test.

fs7so2,naomifinn123,Can someone make sense of my dream?,"I don't really believe that dreams tell you much. I just want people to laugh at how rediculous mine was.

In this dream, my school is my backyard, with the students living in the apple tree, and a shack being the school. Somehow, on the inside, even though it is a shack, it is a round room with dirt walls and glowing vines as lights, with desks made of dirt and covered with vines. My real world French teacher teaches there.

Throughout my entire life in this world, I have been bullied. Not teased, not hurt, but instead the students put up solid colored banners with small oriental designs in groups of five in some specific color order to insult me. Everywhere throughout the yard there are just groups of banners. This is somehow a traumatizing level of bullying.

One day, I go to class and we are put in groups of 4-ish. The assignment is for each group member to come up with something about the French or France, and then go to the teacher and each group member presents it in French. Our group goes up to the teacher first. Everyone says their line. I freeze up and then say, ""La Francois culture populaire est populaire."" (unintelligent French that means that French popular culture is popular.)

After that, a girl from my school who I find generally passive aggressive, negative, and who just has a slight additude whispers to someone that I am stupid. Immediately the whole class laughs at me and I run away. As soon as I leave there are the dreaded multicolored banners everywhere. Classmates are chasing me and laughing. I run out of the wooden gate to the backyard.

I book it down the street, quickly losing my jeering classmates. After a bit, I am at a crossroads. I have three choices of places to go, but narrow it down to two after deciding not to go onto a common street. I then have to choose between going into a random barn or a wheat field. I choose to run into the wheat field.

A tractor driver sees me and I explain my situation. He offers to walk me home and I oblige. On the way home, I see another barn in place of where there is usually two houses. It doesn't matter much, but there was like a two second scene in the dream where I just looked at it.

What counts as a single use, and what's the real deal when it comes to reusing them?","I hear conflicting reports of how to reuse N95 masks. The radio doctor said it would have to be sprayed with disinfectant and then left to dry overnight to be used again. [A WebMD article](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200324/health-workers-get-creative-with-protective-gear) says a mask baked at 158 degrees F in an oven for 30 minutes will retain 97% of its efficacy, and that steaming it over boiling water for 10 mins does the same (95% efficacy). My friend's brother, a nurse on the front lines, claims they simply can't be reused safely.

What should I do and who should I trust? I only have 5 of these masks and am regularly shopping for 4 people over the age of 74. I'd donate them to the hospital but I opened the box to inspect them a month ago before any shortage was reported.

Does a single ""use"" mean that I wore the mask all day as I ran errands and interacted with numerous people? If I venture into the world but don't come close to any people, has the mask still been ""used?"" If I don't remove the mask as I sleep can I stretch a single ""use"" to last several days? If I wear the mask for an hour and then briefly removed it to take a phone call or brush my teeth, does that mean that a single ""use"" has been completed, or can I put it right back on?

fs5yn7,babydory7,#PLS #HELP Domestic workers/personal assistants during COVID-19 pandemic,"I have a specific gripe/question for a pretty specific group of people, but I hope I can have some feedback from the community. And I want to acknowledge how lucky I am to even have a job during this time. I have so many friends who just lost theirs, including my boyfriend, and I hope this doesn't come off as tone-deaf to what so many people are going through right now. I just hope I can get opinions, and find out if others are fighting a similar situation and how they are handling it. Thank you for reading this.

I'm a personal assistant for a very well-off (to put it casually) couple who own a business and each work from home. I do both administrative assistance as well as personal assistance, like watching the two kids when I'm asked (1 is a non-potty trained toddler), babysitting on evenings, taking the dog out, etc.

All last week I was sick with COVID-19 like symptoms, mild, and am now better. (I do not qualify for a test to confirm if I've actually had it, since I'm not over 65, do not have another condition, and have not been in direct contact with someone who's confirmed they had it.) I'm working from home before I am ready- by the CDC guidelines- to be able to leave self-isolation (it has been 72 hours since having a fever, my symptoms have improved, and it will be at least 7 days since the first day of symptoms.)

Just before I got sick is when they put the Shelter in Place order into effect. The couple is able to consider their business essential, being that it's medical-related (but not for treatment,) so they still had me going to their home and assisting them through the Shelter in Place order. The administrative  assistance I do can be done from my home, and is what I'm doing now as I get better.

They have also continued to have their middle-aged housekeeper, who cleans and also watches the children when needed, work in their home during the Shelter in Place order.

Four weeks after I started, they went on a two week vacation out of the country and did not pay me for those two weeks.  Legally, domestic workers are not required to be paid in situations like this, as it is up to the employer. I work an average of 38 hours a week in their home and do not have another job. I was not able to pay my bills for the month because I was unable to book other jobs during that time (with the exception of an $80 puppy-sitting gig during one weekend.)

Domestic workers in my state are exempt from the state-required sick pay for employees. Technically, they don't have me in their payroll as a domestic worker and I would receive the normal sick pay that the state requires for most employees (which I believe is 3 days.) But I haven't been there long enough for it to kick in. Fortunately, just before I got sick, I asked if there could be some type of sick pay worked out for me during this uncertain time in the event that I got sick, and they agreed. At this point, I still had not recovered from the two weeks they went on vacation, so I was very stressed about money and the possibility of getting sick and without pay once again. So they wound up paying me for the amount of time I normally work and for each day I was sick, which they did not have to do and I am definitely appreciative of (5 days, 8 hours each.) 

They expect me to return to work in their home on Wednesday. I sent an update about how I was feeling and that a slight lingering cough and sore throat is still there, but I expect to be good by then. The reply they sent was, ""Ok.""

During this time, during a Shelter in Place where only essential workers should be alongside other people, and during a global pandemic, I think having someone outside of your household working a non-essential job is selfish, irresponsible, and compromising to every person there. And they'd rather do that than do the safest thing for everyone and give pay to a domestic worker to stay home (who's only source of income is through them.) Legally they do not have to. Morally, they should-- and I know they definitely can. I think it's that they want us there to do the mundane work they do not want to do when they don't feel like it. I feel wrong working in their home. I feel that it's wrong to have their housekeeper in their home. But they are not legally obligated to pay either of us in the event that we can't work, and clearly they understand that. Even though I can do the administrative assistance from my home, the housekeeper can't do work from her home. 

Domestic workers - is anyone in a similar situation? Do you have work you can do from home? While we now see that I can, I feel I can't bring up my discomfort and, what I believe, is obvious reasoning behind the necessity of working from home (e.g. safety for everyone; all individuals not of the household should not be there) without acknowledging the housekeeper who should also be safe at home. But I know they wouldn't pay her. Even if they started having me work from home, what about her?

I feel stuck and in a distorted reality from what the rest of the world is going through. They just bought a $700 towel rack the last time I was there.

Also, the double time pay rate (7th day worked with no missed time) is $24. Does this mean I'll get paid $24 after 6 working days or would this be for the 7th day worked in one single week?

fs51ky,HighlyAdorable13,What would you do with this girl if you were in my place? I need some responses please!!,"I've had a crush on this girl in college for well over a year now. We started texting regularly at the turn of the year, where I told her from the beginning that I liked her and would like to get to know her personality better (as in go on dates and stuff to see if we match together as a couple), just to avoid getting into the friendzone. Her answer was quite vague, she didn't exactly say she liked me back but she said ""well we can get to know each other's personalities better and if all goes well, we can take a step together."" We agreed to define our relationship as ""friends who are getting to know each other to see if we romantically click, rather than ""just"" friends""

We've been texting everyday since then and have gone on one casual date and were planning another date/hangout until that corona thing happened, but the thing is I don't even know if she was attracted to me (as in terms of my appearance) in the first place. I feel like if there's no attraction in the first place, no relationship would work. She says I'm handsome when she didn't have to and gave me a 7/10 rating in terms of appearance (idk if that's good or bad considering i'm quite short/skinny but have a good looking face), but at the same time she says that the one time she fell in love was when she felt attraction right at the start. This confused me, so I asked if she had that attraction/a liking for my appearance before we started texting, again her answer was vague, she said something along the lines of ""of course any two people who are getting to know each other better wouldn't agree to get to know one another without liking each other's appearance/being attracted to them in the first place""... so I don't know if it's my low self esteem talking or if she actually doesn't find me that attractive after all.

I don't want to ignore her either.",2,1585623259,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fs51ky/what_would_you_do_with_this_girl_if_you_were_in/,NoStupidQuestions,1

fs4aet,870SWMAN,How come whenever I have issues with customers in my business it's literally the exact same formula / circumstances?,"I grew up working in a retail / fast food business. My dad started it decades ago. I'm a partner now. I'm in my thirties. I'm guy. I rarely have problems with customers. When I do it's a shit show. 

Every single time I've had to confront a customer it's like groundhog day. It's always basically the same. It's always a man. He's entitled and he thinks he's special. He talks and acts like he's superior to everyone. He's usually very loud and he's a ""tough guy."" I don't know how exactly to describe it but compared to the average customer this guy has a very aggressive / assertive posture, he's always got hard eye contact, he's usually glaring at you etc. He always seems like he's ready to rage on someone or lose his temper. He's intimidating, scary, and menacing. 

Usually what happens is the guy comes in a couple times and he's always pushing boundaries. Actually it seems like he goes out of his way to push boundaries, get special treatment, shit on staff etc. He doesn't act like the average customer. His transaction is always way to long. There's always an issue or a problem or something happens. It's annoying / draining dealing with him. It always seems to revolve around the fact he wants you to know and him to know he's the alpha and superior. His behavior is actually usually very irrational. 

So I let this happen a couple of times. I make sure it's not just a fluke or a one time thing. Usually what happens is the guy gets abusive or insulting or threatening to me or a staff member because he isn't getting his way. I'm a pretty chill guy but you're not threatening me or my staff. 

So I stand up to him and he gets even more angry. He might initially try use some bullshit argument but it always ends with him having a temper tantrum. Now he's yelling, threatening, insulting. He's glaring at you, staring you down, trying to get in your space. He's trying to intimidate you. It feels like he's getting ready to fight you. 

I stand my ground and he doesn't get physically violent. Something happens and I guess he realizes his words don't scare you or have any effect on you. I think he also realizes you know he is nothing more than a loud mouth. Then he seems to panic or get scared. I can't put my finger on it but I've had this happen. The guy will go from acting like he's a tough guy to acting terrified. 

If the guy ever comes back it's a complete 180 from his previous behavior. Super respectful. Super nice. Super accommodating.",1,1585620303,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fs4aet/how_come_whenever_i_have_issues_with_customers_in/,NoStupidQuestions,1

How come whenever someone who is ""young"" is hurt or uncomfortable someone older than them almost always says ""you're young its fine""?? Yeah a normal healthy 23 year old would have a body that shouldn't be so easily hurt, but you know what changes that? A life time of full contact sports and improper medical care.

Since when does being young mean you are immune to being in pain? Why has ""you're young"" become a valid reason for someone to be in pain or uncomfortable? It doesnt make sense to me at all, but then again I am 23 so what do it know. I'm only young.

fs3zbo,kinky-but-nice,"ISO advice RE: circumcision (Yeah, you don’t want to get involved, but please do anyway!) I’m against circumcision but my entire support group opposes me, what would you do?","We’re in midwest, USA. Just found out it’s a boy. I preemptively promised this would be an argument if it were a boy, and wasn’t really listened to. Well, here we are. 

I’m 28F. I worked in an Early Childhood Development Center for 4 years in college, and nannied for 6 years. I like to think I have a fairly good understanding of babies and children and development. Admittedly, I have an English degree and am now doing clerical work - I’m no expert on the subject. Anything I know is due to experience/outside research. 

In my research, I’ve found that circumcision is 1) indisputably, a hotly debated topic, and 2) uncommon outside of the USA/Orthodox Jewish community (please tell me if I’ve got this wrong). Because it’s such a cultural norm in the US, it’s been difficult to connect with other like-minded communities near me.

In my research, I’ve also read about how infant circumcisions are done, and why. To the latter point: no reason is compelling enough for me to have my infant taken away from me after birth to be needlessly mutilated.

My boyfriend, parents, in-laws, grandma, step brother (you name it) - are all against me. “He’ll be made fun of”, is a big one, as is “It’s more cleanly, less chance of infection/UTI,” and also, “Don’t you want him to look like his father?”. Not to mention the ever popular, ever effective: “You don’t have a penis, how can you make a decision like this?”

I’ve read that it actually takes away/can affect nerve endings.

Anyway, my personal opinion is not to mutilate my infant son within hours of his birth; you can always take skin away later, but you can’t replace it. Another part of me knows my own boyfriend was circumcised and hasn’t been permanently traumatized or anything. 

AITA? Specifically, I’d value the opinion of adult men who have experience one way or the other.",30,1585619082,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fs3zbo/iso_advice_re_circumcision_yeah_you_dont_want_to/,NoStupidQuestions,1

My grandfather is in hospital due to operation,  which made my grandmother stressed. One night she hallucinated about 2 men standing in her living room,  and the next day my father brought her home so we could help her while grandfather was in hospital. 

At times, she has hallucinations. My mother has yelled at me for laughing in my room (half the building away) saying I made the hallucinations worse. Due to a condition I have that affect separation of dreams and being awake,  I also hallucinate sometimes. In my experience,  a lack of noise and being alone seems to make them worse and more vivid. 

Is my mother right in that noise makes it worse? I'm not sure if Alzheimer's causes a different kind of hallucination.",1,1585618899,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fs3xnd/when_hallucinating_due_to_alzheimers_does_sound/,NoStupidQuestions,1

It's not disturbing: I actually like it alot.

fs3g3h,ImGettinThatFoSho,Why didn't the medical profession and experts plan or foresee an equipment shortage better?,"I ask this question with the utmost respect and acknowledgement that the world is really suffering from COVID19. I don't ask it to be insensitive or blame anyone for the crisis, but I believe the question is necessary so that we can learn and prevent a future epidemic from occurring. 

I have read online reports of hospitals having single digit # of ventilators in times of ""peace"" (not pandemic). Or having supplies of hundreds or only thousands of masks and gloves during ""peace"" times. These numbers obviously were thought out and worked well, as supply shortages aren't a widely publicized issue in times of non-pandemic. 

But I've been curious that these hospitals with single digit ventilators and PPE for thousands of people are often in cities of millions of people. New York, Seattle, Miami, Atlanta, etc.  

It's obvious to many in the medical field, and not in the medical field, how fast viruses can spread. We're all taught to prevent against the flu. We all learn about basic disease transmission as kids. 

So my question is- why in cities of millions of people, did someone not foresee an inevitable shortage of supplies if tens or hundreds of thousands started getting sick all at once. That wasn't that far fetched of a possibility to plan for more ahead of time, was it? 

I'm just curious why cities or states of millions had a stockpile to only cover 1 or 2% of the population.

fs2n7b,HighlyAdorable13,What should I do with this girl? Did she even like me?,"I've had a crush on this girl in college for well over a year now. We started texting regularly at the turn of the year, where I told her from the beginning that I liked her and would like to get to know her personality better (as in go on dates and stuff to see if we match together as a couple), just to avoid getting into the friendzone. Her answer was quite vague, she didn't exactly say she liked me back but she said ""well we can get to know each other's personalities better and if all goes well, we can take a step together."" We agreed to define our relationship as ""friends who are getting to know each other to see if we romantically click, rather than ""just"" friends""

We've been texting everyday since then and have gone on one casual date and were planning another date/hangout until that corona thing happened, but the thing is I don't even know if she was attracted to me (as in terms of my appearance) in the first place. I feel like if there's no attraction in the first place, no relationship would work. She says I'm handsome when she didn't have to and gave me a 7/10 rating in terms of appearance (idk if that's good or bad considering i'm quite short/skinny but have a good looking face), but at the same time she says that the one time she fell in love was when she felt attraction right at the start. This confused me, so I asked if she had that attraction/a liking for my appearance before we started texting, again her answer was vague, she said something along the lines of ""of course any two people who are getting to know each other better wouldn't agree to get to know one another without liking each other's appearance/being attracted to them in the first place""...so idk if it's my low self esteem talking or if she actually doesn't find me that attractive after all. I honestly feel like I should just move on, but then when I stop texting her she keeps initiating conversations...I don't want to ignore her either. 


Key point: we are in an Islamic environment and this girl is a bit more reserved than usual. She's never had a boyfriend, she only likes relationships to be official and doesn't hang out with guys for the sake of it, as far as she's told me she hangs out with a guy she's only getting to know/dating, and if all goes well, the guy can propose to her from her parents. So I feel like even if she likes me back, i'm not ready to propose right now (we're both still students) as I'm not ready, I don't even have a job yet.

She was younger, likely 30s, and so I attributed it to that.

Next woman, older, close to 50s. Same thing, except the first time I say it with her she explains that I should've figured it out with the first woman that women don't like that. I laughed, she didn't. She seemed dead serious as did the younger woman, and I am at a loss now.

fryriz,feeltheillinoiseboys,Is 27 considered a late age to start a 401k retirement plan? I'm worried I'm really behind.,"I had my first real full time job about a year and a half ago at 25. I'm gonna be honest with you, I made the mistake of being really dumb and ignorant and not even thinking about contributing to my retirement plan at the time because I thought I didn't need to do it during my mid-20's. I just turned 27 earlier this year and it wasn't until my own dad had to talk to me about how I shouldn't be wasting a big opportunity later in my life like that.  


 So I contacted his own financial advisor, and they suggested that I initially put in 25% into a Roth IRA account, which is going to start happening on my next paycheck. I'm currently still living with my parents since we're in the same city so I have quite a bit saved in my bank savings account(a little over 30k) right now anyway, just never bothered to invest in anything until now. My current salary is about 45k for anyone curious.   


I wanted to know if I'm way behind the curve compared to my peers and if I have a lot of catching up to do? And if so, what else I may need to do. A lot of issues happened before I had the job right now. I got laid off after my first job out of college at 22 and did a lot of low-paying, low-skilled jobs which enriched my life but didn't leave me a lot of room to invest at the time either.",5,1585600713,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fryriz/is_27_considered_a_late_age_to_start_a_401k/,NoStupidQuestions,1

fryoqa,chxya_xx,What are my options for counseling as an 18 year old?,"Hi guys, I’m living with my parents right now and am under their insurance. With whatever their plan is, they have to pay for all medical bills until a deductible is met. They don’t meet it a lot. When they do, insurance covers 90% of bills. This means counseling that I used to get sometimes is too expensive for regular attendance. Every week or so I ask them if we are close to meeting it so I can get in counseling again and pay the 10% that is left after insurance. 

It is always a big ordeal when I ask because they see it as frivolous. However, even at 18 I don’t have a single best friend, but I have just a couple sorta friends who think I’m a little funny and we get along, but they aren’t there for me emotionally. Nobody is, my parents simply aren’t good people so I feel really alone in the world without anyone listening, *except* for at therapy. My therapist makes me feel good because she listens to what I say and wants to help me. It makes a big difference in someone’s mind when they feel alone versus when they feel like there is a good person wants to help them. I’ve attended on and off for a few years, I’ve probably had under 10 sessions total because the finances. 

My point is, I feel like I need the therapy because I struggle a lot in my head, and at therapy I get to sort stuff out in my head with professional help. 

My mom said that come my 20s, I’ll be on my own and whatnot with insurance. When I am truly alone and have to sort out this stuff on my own, whether it’s next year or 6 years from now, how will I be able to consistently attend counseling? I want to know how to do this sort of thing when I’m alone.

Okay, so there are a LOT of churches telling their ministries they have the cure, they can pray the disease away, that you can’t get it at church, blah blah blah. All things, in my opinion that are proven to be false. People are believing them and still coming in large numbers!

Do you think anyone would question their beliefs if they got sick and/or another loved one, or saw them die in front of them? How would they feel if they just prayed nonstop and nothing ever happened? Would they just rationalize that it was their time? God works in mysterious ways? 

How can one go against science, people dying so fast they are using refrigerated trucks to keep bodies, docs/nurses getting sick and dying, seeing the news... all of these things that show and inform you of how wicked this is... but ONE person tells them they are above that, and they show up to church.

As a nurse on the front lines it’s mind boggling. I’ve NEVER seen doctors scared. I lived in Dallas with Ebola. I want to be safe myself, I want YOU all to be safe, I want my family safe... yet I turn on the news and see this. This is mind boggling to me. 

So can people PLEASE explain to me, if you think or you would question your beliefs if you got sick and/or realized you were dying, or saw another die?  BUT YET YOU PRAYED. 

How would you feel if a doc looked you in your eyes while you’re intubated and said ‘I’m sorry ma’am, but your odds are too poor. We are going to stop helping you fight this, we need this machine for someone with a better chance, we’ll keep you as comfy as possible, you will die, and you will die alone bc no family can visit. And I’m sorry.’

Thanks in advance, please stay civil, I’m TRULY mind boggled and want another perspective.",12,1585599721,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/frygbv/people_and_churchs_will_they_question_their/,NoStupidQuestions,1

fryce7,HighlyAdorable13,"I should move on from this girl, right?","I've had a crush on this girl in college for well over a year now. We started texting regularly at the turn of the year, where I told her from the beginning that I liked her and would like to get to know her personality better (as in go on dates and stuff to see if we match together as a couple), just to avoid getting into the friendzone. Her answer was quite vague, she didn't exactly say she liked me back but she said ""well we can get to know each other's personalities better and if all goes well, we can take a step together."" We agreed to define our relationship as ""friends who are getting to know each other to see if we romantically click, rather than ""just"" friends""

We've been texting everyday since then and have gone on one casual date and were planning another date/hangout until that corona thing happened, but the thing is I don't even know if she was attracted to me (as in terms of my appearance) in the first place. I feel like if there's no attraction in the first place, no relationship would work. She says I'm handsome when she didn't have to and gave me a 7/10 rating in terms of appearance (idk if that's good or bad considering i'm quite short/skinny but have a good looking face), but at the same time she says that the one time she fell in love was when she felt attraction right at the start. This confused me, so I asked if she had that attraction/a liking for my appearance before we started texting, again her answer was vague, she said something along the lines of ""of course any two people who are getting to know each other better wouldn't agree to get to know one another without liking each other's appearance/being attracted to them in the first place""...so idk if it's my low self esteem talking or if she actually doesn't find me that attractive after all. I honestly feel like I should just move on, but then when I stop texting her she keeps initiating conversations...I don't want to ignore her either. 


Key point: we are in an Islamic environment and this girl is a bit more reserved than usual. She's never had a boyfriend, she only likes relationships to be official and doesn't hang out with guys for the sake of it, as far as she's told me she hangs out with a guy she's only getting to know/dating, and if all goes well, the guy can propose to her from her parents. So I feel like even if she likes me back, i'm not ready to propose right now (we're both still students) as I'm not ready, I don't even have a job yet.

frxp1h,OccupationalHazard10,"Is it possible for the United States to disentangle itself economically from China? If so, would we want to?","The more I learn about the Chinese communist party the more I’m freaked out. They’ve got the Uighur ethnic cleansing thing going on, all the things we’ve seen with Hong Kong too, and their suppression of the important voices at the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic. And those are just the recent/ongoing issues. And just some of the issues at that. My understanding is that one of the main hurdles to doing anything about the problems in China is the interwoven nature of our economies, America’s and China’s. Is it even possible to untangle this economic knot that ties us together? If so, how long would that take and how would it probably be done? What would the potential fallout be, and what would this mean, if anything, for our allies and their respective economies that are tied with ours and china’s as well? Would anything we do be effective in hurting the party and not the average Chinese citizen?

Disclaimer: I’m not against globalization, per se. I think its pros outweigh its cons. I just can’t shake the feeling that to continue to trade with China is to implicitly condone the actions of its government. I’m tired of watching public figures walk on eggshells, tip toeing around so as not to upset China for whatever reasons, even if some of them may be defensible.

I am living in the UK and the official advice/law is to stay inside if you’re not an essential worker. Don’t take the tube or public transport. Don’t see anyone you don’t live with. You are only allowed out once per day for exercise alone or with one person you live with or to go to the supermarket/pharmacy.

The government has put out advice that children  who have split parents are still allowed to see the other parent that they don’t live with. 

Just seems like it defeats the purpose of the lockdown?

Now-a-days I feel that everyone has something to say on everything politics, world news, and current events that I am just trying my best to catch up on. 

In short, I just want to know what we could really do in these times besides *playing our part* as an individual. How do I stop becoming the person who just tells people that this is just a part of life and people suck? 

Whenever I listen to senor Trump speak and take questions from the public, he clearly sidesteps every question with the grace of a wild boar in a room full of pots and pans. His continuity is that of *The Room* and his opinions are very blunt and not well rehearsed. 

This being said that he still becomes this center of attention for a majority of news stations in my area and it's beginning to irritate me. Can we really do anything after he's dodged criticism for making horrible impressions, multiple blame games, and his reactions towards natural disasters and this pandemic? 

Do we treat him like that angry child that we pretend isn't there? Do we protest despite being unable to form in numbers anymore? Do I put faith in the hopes that Bernie might win this race? 

Lastly, I do want to add that I am positive that there are more corrupt leaders out there and even worse situations out there in the world.

frudlf,alexandriamcl,"If a longterm S.O is raped, does the other partner have the right to leave because “someone else touched their partner’s body”?","My husband thinks that if a longterm S.O is sexually assaulted, that the other partner can have the right to leave without being considered an asshole on the *sole premise* of it being the fact that they can’t handle the thought of someone else touching their partner’s body. Consensual or not. 

He said that the non-abused partner suffers psychological damage, too and shouldn’t have to stay in a “toxic” relationship. “Does that invalidate their feelings? Just because their hardship is harder?” is something he said in my response when I said “oh boo hoo you have to think about it? What about the person who had to GO through it.” 

He said everyone has a threshold to what they’re okay with happening to their partner’s body. “For example, if you were in a car wreck, that’d affect me psychology would it not? Even if it had nothing to do with me physically. That’s like here (motions to small part on bar scale) and this thing might be (motions to way higher part on bar scale) here to them.” 

Regardless, I think it’s a shitty thing to leave the person you “love” over something they had NO control over. Could have been walking the dog, leaving work, who knows. 

In my opinion, if your first thought is “Oh my god I can’t look at you the same. Your body is wrong to me now and I need to leave” instead of “Oh my god my best friend just went through one of the worst things ever. How can I be there for them?” then you never really loved that person. 

It’s selfish and cruel to abandon those you “love” in their weakest moments. The people who needed you the *most*. It’s one thing if the person went into a vegetable state and refused to get help. But simply because your partner’s body was touched? Boom, you’re done and can’t handle it? 

My husband says I can’t just make a blanket statement and say they’re a shitty person because of that. 

So, if a  longterm S.O is raped, and the partner leaves simply over the fact that someone else touched them, does that make them shitty or are they perfectly within their right? 

TLDR; My husband says I can’t say a person is shitty if they leave their sexually abused partner because of the mere thought that someone else touched them. Consensual or not.

But, once this crisis is over, the demand for airline service will go back to where it was before, and will probably be a lot higher just after things get back to normal as business travelers will be playing catch up for a while at least getting things up and running again.

I feel like I remember something like this in an older relationship story (from a time when letters were more common).

Recently my girlfriend of one year broke up with me, stating that the long-distance we'd been doing for some time couldn't sustain itself since she found out she wouldn't be back in our hometown this summer because of an internship (we are both college students). Even though I was very deeply invested in the relationship emotionally, I didn't struggle too much because I saw this as unavoidable, since we'd been doing long distance prior to this assuming we could date over the summer. However, since everybody was sent home from college because of COVID, I thought we could resume dating. We only broke up two weeks before this outbreak and things had remained on good terms between. However, she isn't interested at all. This has been really difficult for me, and has made me feel like her whole reasoning behind the breakup may have been a white lie. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out what went wrong. When we broke up, she told me I did everything right and it was just circumstances. Now I don't know what to think or feel. I just don't have any closure and I feel like asking back the 15 or so letters I wrote her during this time would help.",3,1585585473,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/frtvwr/is_it_normal_to_ask_for_letters_back_after/,NoStupidQuestions,1

frtbyy,kdanderson5,Opinions on going into houses for work right now,"Hello all,

I am curious to see if I am being unreasonable. 

I work for an internet/cable/phone provider in the USA.  Where I live there is not a huge amount of cases yet, but they are growing daily just like anywhere else. My work put a policy into affect saying we will not be going into anyone's house until this is under control. With that being said, they are still scheduling installs for houses that are new construction or nobody is living in yet. Basically as long as the house is empty, they will still schedule the install. 

Friday for example, even though the house was new construction and nobody was living there, the home owner was still in and out, the painters, plumbers, and some other dude were still there. I refused to do the install, because in my eyes, these are people going job to job everyday and that is even freaking worse then the home owners being there.

For houses that are truly empty, the homeowners and or tenants are still coming and going before us and touching shit like door knobs and light switches and what not so I hate the idea of going into those also.

I am not a super paranoid guy, I am not terrified of getting covid 19 for myself(but obviously I don't want to get it if at all possible) but I have a 10 month old son at home and a mother that JUST finished chemotherapy for stage 4 lung cancer. My mom and dad are doing very good with self isolating at their house, and we have just been face timing with them so they can see my son.  I also realize that MOST younger kids are fine if they do get the virus, but I am not going to weigh my son's health and life on that. 

So after my rambling and bitching, am I being unreasonable in my thoughts I think it is bullshit we are still going into houses if they are empty or not?

Are the most famous professionals the absolute best in their field or does it differ or is it never true? I'm fully aware that **being famous does not make one the best** but does the fame come from being the best or is fame not related at all?

For example, there is no question about Usain Bolt being the greatest of all time (I would think), but is there someone unknown from Jamaica/USA (those countries for obvious reasons) who just doesn't compete?

Is Freddie Mercury the best singer (not artist) of all time?

Is Gordon Ramsay the best chef? (I doubt it but I wouldn't know a better chef)

Is Michael Jordan the GOAT?

Does the fame just mean they had some luck that someone better could've had but didn't? And I'm not talking about an electrician not getting the opportunity to take singing lessons as a child but rather competitors within a profession.

frsn2q,Fake_Pilot,"How hard would it be for the US to switch from the current voting system (first past the post) to a better one, like ranked choice?","Most people agree that the current voting system in the United States is incredibly flawed. First past the post inevitably leads to the two party system that dominates the political landscape. Whenever there is two strong candidates from a single party, since only one can win the parties nomination, often the losing candidates voters don’t vote for their party’s nominee. Any strong third party candidate will never be able to compete regardless of how strong their platform.

Ranked choice is a superior voting system because it allows for better representation. Rather than choosing between the lesser of two evils, it would allow voters to rank their favorite candidates. If they really like a third party candidate and really hate another, they can still vote for their favorite candidate, and if that person doesn’t win, their vote would go to the next favorite. It would prevent people from having to vote based off of who they hate the least.

With respect to the electoral college, if states employed ranked choice, it would ensure that the overall top candidate would secure the electoral votes, or as some states do (Nebraska I think) the electoral votes could be divided based on vote percentages. 

Ranked choice seems like it would be better overall for the public and ensure better representation. But how hard would it be to implement? Would it take legislation to be passed?

frsmpb,existo25,[Serious] How do you handle your grocery shopping now? Do you disinfect everything after you bring it home?,"Grocery shopping starts to really stress me out.

 I live in Budapest where we have fairly low numbers of proved cases, but i still live in the middle of a busy area.  I am not afraid of going out but shopping triggers my anxiety really bad. 

I have kind of a bad case of asthma, so getting sick would be extra unlucky, although i am really healty and in my best shape of my life.

So i have masks and plastic disposable gloves. When i go to the store right below me i put on my gloves. 

First thing... using the same plastic cart that everyone else uses... then getting the things you need. Then the cashier will touch each item you want to take home ( in gloves yeah, but they use the same gloves for the whole day i guess ). You touch your card then to pay. You put the stuff in a disposable bag, i guess that is the best option right now if you dont want to wash a reusable bag everytime. 

So my logic is that it is possible that you have a bag full of infected goods, an infected card, and you put it back to your pocket so from that point you can not even put your hand or tissue ( its cold out ) or phone in that pocket. 

I just went to buy some vegies and i am not kidding but i washed with soap every single tomato and cucumber, then disinfected the card, then threw the plastic bag in the trash, then disinfected the place where i have put the veggies first. Then washed my hand again.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: How do you guys do grocery shopping at the moment? Am i too paranoid? Do you have a method to make theese shopping rounds easier or less stressful?

The playlist includes Skyrim and For the King primarily but has one song from the Wither 3.

Last week I got a temporary job at Plum Market and worked two shifts. Then on Thursday I woke up with a cough so I called them and they told me to stay home. Then I decided I would just stay home until I found out if I was going to be able to collect unemployment. 

Today was the first day I could collect unemployment. You do a questionire and answer questions like ""did you work during this week"" ""were you physically or mentally capable of working this week""

My question is, do I be honest and say I worked two shifts and came down with sickness? Or will they not find out I worked two shifts. Is this the kind of stuff they look up? Does anyone know how it works. Would they know? I would rather stay home and collect unemployment instead of go to work where there's the public and I could spread it, or get sick.

Here's part two to the question. I'm an independent contractor. I don't know how I got issued unemployment.

frp35u,-TrollBuster-,"Since when dating became so difficult that YouTube is filled with ""dating coaches""?","During these days I've been spending some time on YouTube, and I ended up watching some videos on dating. After those videos, I did some quick research and I found out that it feels like the internet is now full of people that are selling training/coaching sessions, and I was wondering how did we got to this point.

People have been dating for millennia, and now out of a sudden we need someone to explain us how to analyze a text message trying to find some hidden hints that we can use to move the conversation further, or someone telling us that we need to plan ahead and have a strategy when you go out to meet people.

Also, most of the times I see questions like ""how do I reply to this?"" or ""what if she says X?"", as if people are not able anymore to deal with unknown situations and they need to have the full clear picture in front of their eyes.

I may be wrong, but I'm finding it hard to believe that such a normal thing became so complicated that it needs multiple hours of live coaching with someone that tells you what to write to someone.

So the question is: did something went wrong in our society causing people to not be able anymore to start a romantic relationship in a more natural way, or is it just the internet trying to feed from people's insecurities?",4,1585567789,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/frp35u/since_when_dating_became_so_difficult_that/,NoStupidQuestions,1

froy1e,moneylearner,People always say that if you get drunk at a restaurant or bar not to drive home and to get a cab or Uber or lyft- but what happens to their car? I thought it was supposed to get towed? Is this really that common?,"Okay, so, I have so many questions about this the title doesn’t do it justice. 

It’s such a common thing to hear someone say, “don’t drive, get a cab or a lyft or Uber” when talking/referring to a drunk/future drunk person. But, most places have laws that you can’t leave your car overnight and that it will get towed. Are people really out here getting their cars towed all the time like crazy? Isn’t it expensive? And even if there is a free service (not sure if aaa is) isn’t that just too much work? I can not imagine people getting their cars towed after frequent common social events being that common. Why do you never see that many tow trucks on the road then but you always see people drinking in restaurants? Yes, I know, a lot of the time people are merely having a drink and not getting past the legal BAC to drive, but come on now I don’t believe for a second that getting drunk at social events (whether it’s a restaurant or not, I was just using that for an example, heck it can be cousin Steve’s get together at this place) isn’t common. You do not ever see a towtruck coming to uncle Steve’s place (okay bad example bc uncle Steve’s driveway isn’t public property, but come on now you get the drift).  I know people love to get wasted at Mexican restaurants, but I don’t see tow trucks constantly pulling up into the lot. So, what happens when a person takes an Uber home because that’s what you’re supposed to do to not be a jerk, but then their car is kind of just hangin there until they sober up? I know in a lot of settings there will be a designated driver, but what about those situations where all parties drink? Or what about the person who goes out alone for whatever reason, maybe they’re new to the town or city and haven’t built a social group there yet, Orr maybe they’re on vacation, or maybe they’ve just had bad luck with friends their whole life, etc? Now a preventative measure I suppose could be to only lyft to places that you plan to drink in those instances, but don’t you dare try to tell me that nobody has ever moved off of their word and drank after they said they wouldn’t 😂😂.

frnz9t,jonjonbonbonbonbon,Would it be possible to 'incept' dementia sufferers to make them feel safe?,"A few years ago, I was watching the Derren Brown show 'The Heist', where he influences people to try to get them to rob a bank. (Bear with me...). During the experiment, he creates a strong link between a particular photograph and his guinea pigs so whenever they see a photo of a money collection truck, they feel incredibly hyped up and confident (the idea in the documentary is that they'll hopefully see the truck, feel hyped up, and go for the robbery without doubting themselves).  


My question is this: would it be possible to do a similar thing with dementia sufferers? I mean, could you create a strong link between a photograph/picture and a sense of security in their minds? Then you could put it on their wall and hopefully whenever they forget where they are and start to panic, they'll see the picture and feel less unsafe? It wouldn't have to be a photo, maybe a piece of music or a scent or another object instead? (or perhaps a combination of all of them).

frnjvx,Eryklav,Whats the reason for sharing disturbing or disgusting videos or images (gore) ?,"It happens to me every now and again. One person in a whatsapp group randomly posts a video of dudes demolishing someones face with a sledge hammer or a video of someone jumping down a building and then a cut to the corpse with the guts exposed. Or just videos of someone defecating.

What's the thought process and what is the receiving party supposed to feel? Sorrow? Pity? Interest? Entertainment? Even Joy?

frn3p8,Prettynig,why do random people in the streets want to beat me up?," honestly i've always been like that

its like i attract negativity

im 18 M

and obviously its mostly guys from the same age group

now, one on one, i lowkey dominate anyone, some people don't even look me in the eye

but if its a group of guys, i always avoid them. honestly, im not scared, but god knows how it could end up

i don't really show any signs of nervousness whatsoever, cuz i know that many people say that if you show that you're weak they will come for you, blah blah

honestly, its the opposite, people who aren't a threat are just ignored

but again, yes my heartbeat does go a bit high, but isn't it natural? like even in animals, the same things happen.

but anyways.

is there anything i could do to decrease it?

one of the ways is to have a predatory attitude, and honestly, i do. i always have a ""ill stab you in the neck if you talk to me"" type expression, but again if its 1 on 10 it wont work. but like even back then when i had a relaxed attitude, honestly, that used to cause even more tension. like the angrier i look the more respect i get almost.

and i've honestly always been like that. like in school, people only were cool if i was quiet (which i wasn't btw) they gripped on any word i said, and paid extra attention to it. its like other people got away with doing stupid stuff, but in my case, like if i was clowning around, it would probably end up with a confrontation, cuz someone would be like oh look at this dick, and then i would respond. but again. no one else got the same treatment.

honestly, why does this happen?

now, dont give me wrong, again, i walk erect, heads up, prideful. is it what they don't like? should i look scared??

its actually tiring and kinda scary sometimes, like there's literally no one i know who gets the same reaction as me. is there anything weird about me? is there anything i should change? cuz again i might literally get stabbed, stares some dudes give me are intense as hell. they want to kill me literally.",14,1585557491,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/frn3p8/why_do_random_people_in_the_streets_want_to_beat/,NoStupidQuestions,1

A one size fits all approach wouldn't work so I was thinking more along the lines of a sliding scale depending on company size. Maybe the number of employees could be the metric? For example, &gt;10 employees you'd be required to save 1% of profits, 11-50 to save 3% and 50+ to save 5%.

To counter companies resisting expansion I thought a buffer period would be a practical way for them to increase saving slowly. For example 6 months once you move into the next savings ""bracket"".

I appreciate this thinking doesn't take into account companies which deliberately never make a profit to avoid tax or international companies like facebook/google/etc. In those instances maybe the employees working in that country only or switch the measurement to the profit made in that country only (e.g. UK profits only).

What are other similar examples of events pushing forwards as best they can?","While seemingly everything else has been canceled, the most visible weekly wrestling shows continue on as if nothing happened. Whether it's [AEW Dynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvP9x8TDwu4) on TNT, [WWE Raw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCB2wBDhJ-E) on USA, or [WWE Smackdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD6ynukTdAI) on FOX, there have been new episodes every week in their usual timeslot... with one minor difference: there aren't any fans.

Vince McMahon has grown the WWE from a regional success to a global powerhouse since he 80s, while newcomer AEW is backed by the same owners as the Jacksonville Jaguars. Both companies have the luxury of owning large enough properties to film closed-set episodes of their weekly shows. In fact, WWE isn't missing a beat - Wrestlemania is continuing along as scheduled next week in similar fashion.

I was among the [80k fans watching at MetLife Stadium](https://i.imgur.com/zFZsBGV.jpg) last year. I'm really curious to see how they intend on pulling off their biggest show of the year in an empty arena.

frmgwc,AdamCrocHunter,How does international law influence matters of the Division of Power and Original Jurisdiction?,"I genuinely don’t know how to answer this. We received some questions for homework, and so far I’ve gotten 10/10 on all of the work that my teacher has set. However on this homework assignment I received 4/10, which was a shock to say the least as I put a lot of effort &amp; time into this subject (want to study law at Uni).

The topic is on International Law Relevance to Australian Domestic Law. 

For the issue of Division of Powers, I wrote this,
“The Doctrine of Division of Powers divides powers between the Commonwealth, states and territories. Some example cases include:
- Toonen v The State of Tasmania (1994)
- Commonwealth v Australia (Franklin Dam Controversy)”. 

For Original Jurisdiction I wrote, 
“Original Jurisdiction is the power for a court to hear a case for the first time. Example cases include:
- Mabo v Queensland (1992)
- Dietrich v Queen (1992)”

I realise that I did not comment on how international law influences the division of powers and original jurisdiction, however that’s because I genuinely do not know HOW it influences these issues. I’ve checked the textbook and slideshow presentation that he’s shared us into, and there’s genuinely nothing on how it (international law) influences the division of power and original jurisdiction.",1,1585553912,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/frmgwc/how_does_international_law_influence_matters_of/,NoStupidQuestions,1

frkzrf,PureStress,Why don’t we infect all high risk people with COVID right now?,"Regarding COVID in the US, everybody’s talking about how the healthcare systems will be overrun. Those with no underlying condition will be fine (terrible sickness at most, but probably not life threatening). The problem is that our citizens with underlying conditions will require the ventilators and other supplies. This supplies will run out and those who need the vents but can’t get on them will die.

So, why don’t we begin infecting those who need the vents now, get them on the vents, get them their antibodies and get the next people in? My presumption as to the answer is that the death rate (even with vents) for this population is very high (I’ve heard 80%), that we’d essentially be killing 80% of these high risk people.

Oddly, it gives me satisfaction to know things, culture, facts, science, and be able to sustain a conversation with anybody about anything.

My problem is that ""I don't know what I don't know"", so I end up in an endless chase to knowledge...

I like being sober now for a couple hours, especially morning and afternoons so I can study, workout etc. But during the night I feel the need to not be sober and I enjoy drugs. Even when I had surgery I enjoyed the opiate sensation, I quit with no issue but still.

Is there a term for this? I'd say ""addict"" or even alcoholic, but if I had another thing that was socially acceptable to be fucked up on besides weed(during quarantine) I would. Even cocaine has been peaking my interest because I love feeling energy and the different ways the brain behaves. I went a few days without alcohol too and i know I CAN do it, I just dont want to.

I pretty much am a lock to get into PT school and I think I’d love to be a physical therapist.

I guess I’m asking, does anyone know of any other grad programs that I’ll make more money and/or not have to take out as many loans? I know you’re supposed to study and do what you love, but you can really only do that when you’re financially stable. I just feel like PT won’t do that for me. I’ve looked at changing my major to nursing and then getting my msn. I’ve also looked into PA, being a Perfusionist, or even just going all in and going to med school.

frjiit,GroceryBags_,Did I fry my PC internals by not replacing broken case fans for months.,"Just by typing this I feel like an idiot, and I am very much a novice when it comes to computers. So with that out of the way, my PC was pre-built and came with 3 cheap stock case fans. 2 ended up dying (I think one near my GPU, if that’s relevant) and I, for reasons unknown, just never replaced them. My pc had decently hot air coming out of it, and after an uncharacteristically long gaming session I noticed a significant drop in performance. Ever since I consistently drop frames, get high CPU usage, and have to run games on low that I used to run on ultra high. My GPU is a RX 480 if that matters.

I’ve since replaced the fans and my pc runs much cooler, but I can’t help but feel that this was like putting sunscreen on after you’ve already been sunburned. My performance is still poor, and I’m pretty sure I did some permanent internal damage. Is this plausible, and is there any way to sort of figure out which individual components were damaged?

Says that mortgage banks are getting margin called because the Fed drove up the prices of mortgage backed securities by buying too many of them. Apparently thee banks had hedged their position in some way and they used margin for this? So I have a couple of questions:

1. Why does the fed have to intervene to buy MBSs if the banks are already hedged in this way?

2. How do they hedge their position? Like, who would pay them if the mortgage values crashed. And why did they have to use margin to do it ?

fris97,AdamLest60,2 identical women and 1 dog stare at me at around 6 - 7:40 pm every Tuesday?,"
I made this reddit account seconds ago as I am am baffled at what’s happening here, I live in a small town not far from a city centre and I’ve been really spooked the hell out recently.

This stalking ish behaviour has been happening 2 weeks now, and I’ve noticed it’s been happening every  Tuesday at around 6 to 7 pm and it really unnerves me and even leaves me paranoid all day, their house is a semi detached house and 2 windows on the 2nd floor face my big window upstairs and it happened that I was just looking out one evening and noticed both of these women staring at me emotionless, it was very very creepy and these women aren’t young they’re at least in their 40s.

They almost look identical although I’ve noticed that there was a dog also looking at me but from  his dog house downstairs but he’d  lose interest very quick but it all just happens so suddenly that it feels like it’s all calculated. I find it very hard to explain as I am very very scared right now and I don’t even know how to word this properly but it’s almost out of a horror movie it’s just 2 women staring for no reason 4 years here and this is my first time seeing this and I don’t know what to think of this, is this a joke? 


I never see them out anywhere, I’ve lived here 4 years and haven’t seen them outside once!

Last Tuesday was exactly the same but what really shocked me is the fact that these 2 women seem to come out at the exact same time and they stand there for about 16 minutes as if they have to do it idek how to explain it’s like they’re tasked to do it, I’ve been very scared ever since, I remember leaving once to help my mom with her new wardrobe in and I saw them stare down exactly at me with the dog and with emotionless faces literally emotionless faces staring down at me while I’m moving stuff it’s very very unnverving and I feel like I’m forced to call the police.

I couldn't push him away. I don't know why but waking up to him f***king me while we are both breathing heavy and sweating all over each other. The smell between us was fantasic. 

This went on for an hour until I rolled over and started biting on his lips and exchanging saliva with heavy making out. 

Finally the best feeling was sitting up and having both of our juices flow out of my lady bits, I love that so much!

I can't deny that it was one of the top f*** sessions we have ever had. 

Is this wrong? Even though we are married some would argue it was still r*pe in the beginning as I was unconscious.

I can't sit by and read crap like that.) Most recently all I've done is ask her for the source of some information without making any judgement. I'm not the only one who's pointed this out to her before. But any time anyone says anything she gets argumentative and accuses everyone of ""talking down"" to her.

I moved in with him after the end of a 7 year relationship and this is my first time living with another person I'm not dating or related to.

I've always had issues with his personal hygiene. But I tried to just work with it and eventually even figured out creative solutions.

Prior to the Coronavirus, I had convinced him to join me at the swimming pool in order to help him with his weight. It worked great because I killed two birds with one stone. Had him losing weight and taking regular showers at the pool.

But then everything shut down and we've been placed on home office and under quarantine.

The last time we went to the pool was March 1st. He has not bathed, used deodorant, or brushed his teeth since then. As a result, he and our shared flat smell like the underwear of a homeless man.

When he uses the bathroom. He doesn't wash his hands. He does however, go to the sink and wets his hands (doesn't actually wash, the water is on for literally two seconds)

It wasn't until today that I realized he hasn't had a hand towel in the bathroom, or a body towel for a long time. In fact the only towel in the bathroom is mine.

So anyways I vomited from the realization I've practically been drying off after my showers with his feces.

How do you suggest I bring this up to another grown man?

frh12s,Do-Breathe-Oxygen,Am I a sadist?,"I've got a lot of weird reactions that make me really suspect if I'm a sadist, but when seeing discussions about sadism, some things pop-up that I really don't like.

Some of the things that make me suspect this are:



Wanting the partner to scream, and say things like ""no, no, wait"" etc. 


My partner being in (a not huge) amount of pain being a turn-on


My partner trying to resist me but not succeeding being a turn-on


Wanting to do anal specifically because it's more painful to my partner 



...Things like that. Not proud of it. Also important to mention, I don't like BDSM. 


But anytime I see a discussion about sadism, people are talk about genuinely wanting to hurt or kill, tie up, and stuff that's alot more serious.

Also, I'm extremely against violence in day to day stuff. I literally can only remember trying to harm someone twice (excluding friendly banter) since kindergarten. Though ai do have lots of violent thoughts. 

And so because of all of that I'm not sure if I really an sadistic.

Here is what's I can tell you guys:

Her cycle is usually like 30 or 31 days long with her period usually at 4-5 days.

Her period in January went from the 9th to the 15th with the last couple days being really light.

We didn't have sex after that and her February period was a week late. Her cycle that month was 38 days, her period went from February 16-20.

We had sex on February 21 and of course we used a condom. Her iPhone health tracker (the stock one) predicted she would ovulate late in the first week or early in the second week of March.

She's about a week late now (it would be day 44) and she's been feeling things like bloatedness, lower back pain, she had diarrhea like symptoms a few days ago and had cramps the last 2 days. I know these could be pms symptoms but if I understand correctly they could also be early pregnancy symptoms?

frgi79,1hate2choose4nick,How do you deal with crazy? up to fanatics.,"This is not about vaccines cause autism, the moon landing was fake or some other conspiracy theories.

About a year ago, i heard about flat earthers the first time. At first i thought it was satire.

But to my unbelieve there are in fact people who think the earth is a ""disc"" and there is some sort of dome over it. Not many afaik, but still.

So, this is beyond simple stupidity. This is nuts. Right?

But these people a not hostile and don't endanger others.

They are still allowed to have children and may indoctrinate them with their nonsense.

Which will be no help in school or in life until they hopefully realise.

But as i said, they are no imminent danger. Especially to me.

Then there is a different caliber. A few day ago i learned about the subreddit r/BanVideoGames.

I mean, it has to be the greatest troll community worldwide or they are craziest people i've ever ""met"".

And these folks are not only nuts. They are hostile. Calling gamers "" massmurdering nazi psychopaths"" and saying things like ""Amen brother, gamers were a mistake, I wish they'd all die"". Everyone is a schoolshoter. Hitler killed the jews because he was a gamer (before videogames existed). Every gamer is autistic etc.  It's so absurd, it has to be satire. That's what i thought reading through some stuff there.

But because some of them sound so crazy and get so hostile if you try to ask or have a propper conversation, let's assume some are serious and  believe what they are posting.

I tried different approaches to find out if they are just trolling.

But they either stay so perfectly in character or... 

They are fanatics.

Now to my question. How do you deal with this kind of people. You can't argue with them. They will never get professional help. But if it doesn't concern me directly, do i just ignore them and hope they never get some political power or get violent? Do you just let them develop some sort of cult or parallel community?

What if they start to get violent. Do you wait for this to happen or is there a way for the health system, government or the community to help these people? Am I obliged to do something?

I'm no doctor and don't know if there is a connection between mental health issues, intelligence and fanatism.

So i was hoping to find some insight into the mindset of these people and how i should behave towards these people.

Sorry for the wall of text. But this is something I'm thinking about for a long time.

So, thank you for your time and i hope my grammar is not too flawed (not my native language).

frfk0k,stocksrcool,How close was I to dying?,"This happened many years ago in the U.S., and I'm just wondering how close I was to my life being over. So I was using an extension cord that had the ground prong broken off. I had a water pump plugged into it, which was used to get water off of a pool cover. 

The pump became stuck, so I used the hose to pull it out of the water. It had a spinning plastic fin thing on the bottom, and it was secured with a metal screw. There were some leaves stuck in it, so I was trying to remove them. My finger made contact with the metal, and I received a zap, which felt almost exactly like the zap I received when I touched the wires of a broken lightbulb that was still plugged in. 

I was standing on concrete, and if I remember correctly, I had rubber sandals on. So my questions are: Would I have been shocked if I would have touched the water when the pump was still in it? Would I have died if I was not wearing my sandals? Would a grounding wire have prevented me from getting shocked?

frfekz,Kingofrat024,"Should I join the military and if so, what branch?","Hello.
I'm a 19 year old male here in U.S. I used to work as a manager for a local resturaunt inside a mall. Honestly I find it highly unlikely that I will ever truly set foot back in that place. If i did it probably wouldn't be for another year. My boss just said it probably it'll be through april, but I feel like that date will just get pushed back further. Honestly I have no idea, but I guess that's kind of beside the point.

I was planning on going to community college and get a certified in production/broadcasting tech. I love working with multimedia stuff. But a college degree doesn't feel worth the debt. I don't even know the likelihood of finding a job with that. 

There really aren't many careers paths i'm truly passionate about and whatever ones I might enjoy just don't really feel like a feasible option.

I honestly just want a good paying job with good benefits. I just want to come home to my girlfriend and work on my music and just live my life. 

I mean being able to travel is a plus. Healthcare ontop of all the other benefits seems like a great deal. But i don't know a whole lot about military life.
My dad was in the Army and I was in JROTC one year so im not completely clueless as to what I would be signing up for.

My girlfriend (we've been together almost 4 years now btw and were good friends a couple before that) is scared of the thought but I think that's just because she thinks I'd get sent to the frontlines and get injured. 

Basically I just dont really feel like I have many other options. It's like i have to chose a kind of shitty job with great benefits versus a mediocre job with shit benefits.

One last slightly off topic question. I love weed, and while I could easily give it up for a good job, I would love to be able to still smoke.

A bit of backstory. I had a hard childhood- physical mental and sexual abuse. To cope I repressed most of my emotions. For the longest time I could basically only feel happiness, anger or nothing. I’m a few weeks away from being 19 now. A couple months ago I began to recognize my pattern of repression and the effects it’s had on my life, and made an effort to stop. I’ve started going to therapy but I’ve only had two sessions so far, so not much progress has been made yet. 

I recently broke up with my boyfriend of 3.5 years to work on myself and discover my independence. I really loved him but we were both in a bad place when we first started dating and it’s hard to build a healthy foundation for a relationship from that. I’m extremely upset because of it, but it’s hard to let go of my old ways of pretending I’m fine and putting it out of my mind. I find crying to be helpful, but even when I’m extremely upset over it I can rarely let it out. I think it’s making it harder to process all the pain when I can’t focus on it.

 “Had to leave work early and go to the dr today. They suspect flue. I bet I got sick cuz that customer came in a coughed on me”

And the post I made before work stating 
“Going to work even tho I feel like passing out ugh theses allergies lol”

Now I’m worried about responding to my family’s comments on my page about how I’m doing and if the fever is getting better. 

Can I be written up for this or possibly be let go over it?  Do I need to be worried about everything I post from now on? What if my boss doesn’t like my views and it causes her to treat me poorly at work.

 “had the flue and licked all the food I made then threw up and went home had a good day at (name of the workplace).

Spicy has a major problem with talking about people behind their backs and trying to get as many people as possible in trouble to look better on her self. She also has an extremely close relationship with my boss. It’s to a point that it’s against policy and if found out they would both be reprimanded and Spicy would be moved to another store. 

Spicy sent my Facebook post to my boss to try and stir up trouble because she is angry that I need to miss a week of work due to my flue and she has to work 6 days straight this week.",17,1585522637,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/frf75a/can_my_boss_reprimand_or_fire_me_for_posting/,NoStupidQuestions,5

frdur8,z_derApfel,"Did the older generations fail us (Gen Z) as parents, or is this not as common as I think?","This is a multi-faceted question that I really have been doing a lot of thought on.

For starters, I'm not trying to make excuses about my own life, I'm also not trying to put myself on a pedestal. I'll detail more below

What I observe is a lot of people in my age group (I'm 22 going on 23 this year) failed to transition into adulthood healthily. What I mean is, there's a lot of them that I know/observe who still live with their parents (which in itself isn't exactly a bad thing) without making efforts to better themselves as people. As in they don't have hobbies, they work minimum wage jobs, don't have an interest in college/school or if they do they end up picking degrees that are ""easy"" rather than ones they are passionate about, etc.

In my case, I went through a lot of stuff growing up (abuse, losing my mother at age 16, getting into trouble with the law at age 14 due to some bad mistakes I made...with which I have paid my debt to society for already). But even so, when I was 18 I was energetic to get out of my guardian's house (which were my stepfather's parents, who I couldn't stand) and did so. I enrolled in community college and found an apartment cheap enough that I could live off of with my minimum wage McDonald's job.

But two semesters before I finished my Associate's degree I realized I really had no career interests whatsoever. I took several career assessments, and just couldn't find an affinity. I did some self-reflection and realized that growing up I honestly didn't get a lot of opportunity to foster any sort of interest in anything. My (birth) father tried to teach my plumbing, car mechanics, electrical/computer stuff, mathematics but it just didn't interest me. I worked Landscaping for four years with my step-grandpa's business (age 14-18) and it taught me a good work ethic but it also taught me that I hate working outdoors (sorry if that makes me sound lazy, I just hate sweating).

But yeah, now I'm in my early 20s, not really interested in much. I've picked up a few hobbies (Dungeons and Dragons, German language) but I see no real monetary profit there. Living with my girlfriend and her family because she's got a disability that requires her to be cared for and I'm not financially stable enough to get my own place anymore (lost job a couple times in the last two years and I have to pay off some debts, which I'm working two jobs to do)

Okay so here's my main question. Is this an observable trend where Gen Zs are mostly unmotivated/disinterested, or am I getting a narrow view of it? Is this something that's been studied and can be attributed to any one factor?

If you were watching a show &amp; you found an Easter egg would you expose the said kameo if it was hidden in a questionable scene? 

One such scene would be a teacher in a high school who grabs a student's phone, because the whole class suddenly received texts and began to laugh. The concept of what is happening isn't explicit, but you notice that the actual photo on display on the phone was something entirely different than what it was meant to be. Obviously because a shows producers are not going to use a graphic image of a minor, so instead they replace the said photo on the phone with something like a hidden reference to an icon that is popular.

So I was wondering, why don't more operating systems use a ""When you delete a file it goes to trash, and we will automatically overwrite the oldest deleted files when we need more space on the disk"" system?

Like, the operating system will only delete files by marking them as empty space for later use. And automatically use those space when disks are full?

I'm in my early 30s, and I find myself gravitating towards clothes that are stylish but still brands that my dad buys that I have avoided in my teens and 20s. I'll find myself looking for more comfortable clothes that are also durable (just like he does). I was out shopping for some shoes and legitimately stopped at the same white tennis shoes that he has worn for years and thought maybe they were worth getting.

The last time I was shopping for jeans, I unconsciously thought the type of blue jeans he normally wears seem like a good option, even things like the same 12 pack of socks or what's worse, considering buying the same brand of briefs as him instead of my usual boxers because he once told me ""you won't wear boxers for forever"" (maybe he was right about that), or even using the same worn out wallet until it falls apart.

He's not a bad dresser by any means, but as I get older I find the same style that I used to wear not appealing anymore, and maybe just spending so much time with him that his style has worn off on me. I would tell him this, but I know he'd never let me live it down.

They control everything, they strive for greater control of everything, and they care little for anyone or anything else unless it benefits them in some way. However, particularly with me trying to make sense of stocks and how/where they come from, I’ve realized that we as a world cannot function without these people. So many advances in technology and modern life wouldn’t be possible without their very deep, very greedy pockets. So I have to wonder, is this just the situation we are doomed to be in forever?

frctku,nsqThrowAway420,Has anyone else noticed a severe shift in messaging from the various sanders subreddits lately?,"Hi, made a throwaway because I don't engage in political stuff on my main account which is connected to my irl identity. Being that these things can get heated, I'd rather not risk being doxxed. I've spent a fair bit of time lurking in the various candidate subs and the larger political subs despite not engaging, because I like to read peoples' opinions on things regardless. Something I've noticed lately is that after the CA super tuesday election, the messaging in the sanders subs has slowly shifted from largely pro ""blue no matter who"" and a lot of chatter about how sanders could still win, to largely defeatist and anti biden. Especially since the allegations against biden have come out, the message has turned HARD in these subreddits. Where before the general message was ""we did what we could and now we have to rally behind a candidate to defeat donald trump"" the general message has shifted to ""we've failed, and now anyone voting for biden is voting for trump"". 

The anti biden defeatest stuff can be seen heavily in the comment sections of the top posts on /r/OurPresident and /r/SandersForPresident but also all over the regular posts in the subs. Further, the regular posting has become less pro bernie and more anti biden in general.

https://old.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/fqoh5x/tara_reade_says_she_was_sexually_assaulted_by_joe/


I don't have much but conjecture to go by here, I don't exactly keep meticulous notes of all the reddit threads I've read. These are just some trends I've noticed. The pro bernie people I know in real life are still in the blue no matter who camp, and are still campaigning for the sanders campaign... so at least in my personal social circle, people haven't made this shift in thinking. 

Has anyone else noticed this change? what might you attribute it to? I'm not keen to believe that thousands of people suddenly turned on their heels from ""blue no matter who"" to ""a vote for biden is a vote for trump"". Perhaps its possible, IDK. I just want to maybe get people talking about it cus i think its weird.",1,1585514225,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/frctku/has_anyone_else_noticed_a_severe_shift_in/,NoStupidQuestions,2

frcclv,Jakeenes,What is the appropriate way to leave the house when a significant other is home?,"So I was kind of wondering about this. During this stay at home thing, I like to get out of the house a few times a day to go on a drive. However, my girlfriend tells me I need to ask her/tell her before I do.

Obviously, I’m fine with letting her know I’m going out for a little bit, but sometimes things are questionable to me. I often feel trapped at home because when I let her know I want to go on a drive, she often doesn’t want me to. She says we need to talk about it and often gets a bit upset when I want to go for my drives.

I know she just wants me around, but we spend a ton of time together every day. We have breakfast together every day, go for walks together, watch shows together, etc. But I NEED a little alone time each day. Especially since neither of us are working and we’re stuck at home. She doesn’t really like going on drives or doing things by herself and we’ve both acknowledged that she is a bit codependent.

I get kind of nervous to tell her/ask her about me going for a drive because it often turns into a bit of a discussion about how I should want to be home with her. I don’t go to hang out with people or anything like that; I’m literally just driving around for about a half an hour.

I promised her I would stay with her the entire day one day, but my Mom called me and asked me to copy a few documents for her. Even though I promised I’d be with her the entire day, I thought, “Hey, it’s something I have to do for my Mom quick anyway, so maybe ten minutes of time out of the house by myself wouldn’t be such a big deal.” We got into a huge argument because she said she’d go with me to my Mom’s and I didn’t find ten minutes to be a big deal. Maybe I was in the wrong for using my Mom’s request as an excuse for me time despite the fact that I promised? I guess I’d understand more if it wasn’t often such a big deal about me wanting to simply leave the house for a little bit. 

Anyway, just wondering what everybody’s opinion is on their partners leaving the house.",4,1585512595,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/frcclv/what_is_the_appropriate_way_to_leave_the_house/,NoStupidQuestions,1

We aren’t taught how to deal with dogs in school, and many of us didn’t grow up with pets to be able to learn how.

Edit: Yes it’s just common sense to give them space, but isn’t it also common sense to not walk alone at night as a female or get too drunk at parties?

Mine is AC powered I think. at least I can't find an external inverter to take it from AC to DC. And I believe that AC powered Fan's speed is governed by the frequency of the AC power. in America, it is usually 60 Hz. so how do they get different speeds out of the fan?

fr9sqc,TheIdesofApril,How could I play the game Salad Bowl online over zoom? (Details below),"For those who don’t know Salad Bowl, it’s a simple charades based game.

Basically there are four stages - 

1.	Each person writes 3 or more words/phrases/quotes/people/ anything else on pieces of paper. Everyone’s paper pieces then go into a bowl, and people are split into two teams.
2.	For the first round, you describe the word without using any of the words on the sheet.
3.	For the second round, you act out the word without using any words at all.
4.	For the final round, you describe the word using only one word (words on the paper can’t be used, nor can charades), once you choose a word, it cannot be changed, if your team cannot guess it you have to let the time run out.

Further explanation: 
Each round is split up into minute long segments. Once a team member draws a word from the bowl, the timer starts. When the word is correctly guessed, the bowl is passed to another member of the same team and a word is drawn by that member. This continues until the time is up, and the bowl is then handed over to the other team, who continues with the same rules. When a word is not guessed within the 60 seconds it is placed back into the bowl, for that reason you cannot not tell your team what the word was if they could not guess it.

When a word is correctly guessed, that team holds onto it until the round is over. Once all words have been guessed, both teams tally their correct guesses and write them down. All words are then placed back into the bowl, and the next round begins.


So...

What I was hoping to find was some sort of app that would allow my family and I to play this game online while video chatting. We would need to have some way of writing word and adding them into a “bowl” and we would also need to be able to pass that “bowl” and return the words to the “bowl” at the end of each round.

Sorry for the long message, if anyone knows someway we could do this I’d love to hear it! If not you can enjoy this game at home with your own friends and family :)",1,1585503718,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fr9sqc/how_could_i_play_the_game_salad_bowl_online_over/,NoStupidQuestions,2

Confusing question so here’s a little more depth:

The best way I can explain it is like the loading lobby before battle royal games where you run around and can shoot and everything but it’s not like the actual thing.

For example, I use Hulu (balling on a budget, yes I have ads) and whenever the ad comes on I’ll close my eyes and try my hardest to sleep and then when the show comes back on I continue watching. Even if I’m not tired and have exhausted all social media I’ll do it and it seems to help me fall asleep, but on the downside sometimes I’ll be extremely tired and fall asleep during the ad but when the show comes back on I’ll wake up and keep watching until the next ad.

fr9h3k,KristiTheFan,"From a psychology standpoint, could someone explain why I get the warm fuzzies when I see things that I find really precious or adorable? Like babies with big eyes, or chibi characters in video games like Animal Crossing or Townkins? The player characters have big anime eyes!","I am a really friendly and caring person in the real world (not trying to say that I’m not one of those online) and when I see the look of the player character’s faces in games like Animal Crossing and it’s sequels, the big eyes and cute facial expressions make me feel like I wish I could hold the character like a human baby. The player characters in Townkins also give me the same feeling. Is this weird or a normal reaction to have?

I love babies and small children, their tiny voices, big eyes, and such innocence and pureness about them. Last summer I was at a birthday party for my stepmother and one of my Dax’s friends and his wife stopped by with their children. I was given the opportunity to hold their one month old son. I held him for over an hour, singing to him (I don’t consider myself a good singer but if I put a baby to sleep that’s a good thing at least), talking to him, rocking him and I also got to give him a bottle at one point. The entire experience just felt like heaven and I can’t wait to have a child of my own someday.

Is there any psychological reason for why I get this ‘baby holding fever’ when I see a video game or movie character with big anime eyes like in Animal Crossing or Townkins? Is there any way that science can explain it?

Btw, do dissuade any confusion, I am not in any way an evil person. I honestly wish I was a real angel so I could protect all the children in the world somehow and keep them safe from harm or evil people out there. I’ve heard of what people can do and it makes me sick... sorry to get serious for a moment but that’s how I honestly feel.

Currently quarantining at my boyfriend's, and it's fuh-reezing here. He has a gas heater that was maintenanced a few weeks ago, and we do have a small carbon monoxide detector in his apartment. He normally keeps the heat at one level above the minimum. However, since I'm here, he's turned the heat up to one level below the maximum (don't worry, he's turned off the heat in the main room so he doesn't melt). 

So, my question is... could this quick increase in gas temperature increase the risk of a carbon monoxide leak? I don't know how that would happen, but I also know nothing about household appliances and my boyfriend doesn't seem to know, either. Sorry if this question seems to make no sense, but... I'm so paranoid about it that I have convinced myself it's possible lol. If anyone knows more about this than I do, please please let me know!

I don't understand what qualifies as someone being 'white'. If it's purely skin tone, why not Jewish people? If you take historical oppression into account, why are Irish people 'white' when they were oppressed by their 'white' neighbours for most of their history?

Why would countries of 'white' people who have suffered at the hands of other 'white' countries in their history be grouped into this blob of 'white' people that colonialism and slavery are attributed to?

Many 'white' Europeans aren't privileged in their own countries. But on a global level discussion, they have 'white privilege' due to American culture being dominant.

fr7n2g,The_GodKing,How should I handle this situation regarding my project supervisor who's severely ill with the coronavirus?,"**Pre:** My question is what I should or shouldn't say to my tutor who's allegedly in the ICU (intensive care unit). Another professor started spreading this information, without their consent.

_______________

College student, doing a longish (50 page) project at the moment. It's not what's important.

Got an email yesterday morning adressed to my cohort titled: ""Sad news about one of your professors.... :("", very tactful I know. The email had been retracted, so I could only see the subject and sender. There was another email with a titled ~""Coronavirus update - Rumors and Privacy"" essentially telling people not to spread any information that could be incorrect, misleading, or against someones privacy.

I checked the student cohort facebook group and there are screenshots of the retracted email saying ~""Your professor has the coronavirus and they're in the ICU, send them your best wishes"". People are saying that this is unconfirmed and such, others are saying that the emailer is being reprimanded somehow.

I don't really know what I should do. Should I just pretend I haven't heard any of this?!  Do I follow the email and say ""Get well soon""? Should I even be bothering someone by sending an email while they're in intensive care? I need to check a draft at some point before the deadline in a couple of weeks, but if this is true then there's no chance I want to add this to his list of concerns.

I don't know this guy personally or anything, but he's been a great help on my project for the past few months.",1,1585495910,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fr7n2g/how_should_i_handle_this_situation_regarding_my/,NoStupidQuestions,1

So, I'm 16 and I'm socially awkward because I've been fat and stuff all my life, not so much now, but still. In 8th grade, I moved to high school and I met this girl that I didn't like at all at first but then she grew on me. But there are a few problems: The first is that she isn't from a small town near the city, the second it, as I mentioned above that I'm really insecure about myself and the third reason I'm afraid to tell her what I feel about her, is that I'm scared that that might ruin our friendship because we are from the same class (I know its a bad idea to have a relationship with a classmate) and I don't know what to do, I mean if I tell her and she tells me to fuck off or something it would be really awkward for the next two years.  
So I want to ask you what would you do in my situation.

fr7izv,pupsrmyfave,Is my roommate mentally ill?,"I live with my boyfriend, whom I have dated for about 4 years now. Last year, I moved in with him and his roommate, who we will call Steve.

When I first moved in, I thought Steve was pissed. I had spent a few weekends at the apartment before moving in, and everything always seemed fine. But now that I was living there full time, it seemed like Steve loathed my presence. I felt bad, because obviously Steve wasnt happy with me having moved in.

I talked to my boyfriend about it, and he said that's just how Steve is. I tried to shrug it off.

It has been a year now, and the 3 of us moved into a bigger house together last summer. 

I now know that my boyfriend is right, and that's just how Steve is, but wtf man. This guy has issues and I don't know what is going on with him.


I am big on ""energies"" and really feel like I have a good sense for them. Steve's energy is bad most of the time... you can try to be friendly and even just say ""hello"" to him after getting home from work and it is a total crapshoot as to whether or not you will get a response.

If Steve is unhappy with something, he grumbles under his breath almost whispering to himself.

With the pandemic, my bf and I stocked up on freezer food, and when Steve went to get some ice I heard him grumble, ""jesus fucking christ.."" bc our freezer was so full.

Steve supposedly hates confrontation, but is OFTEN grumbling and muttering his grievances under his breath.

Steve might be an alcoholic... the only times I feel Steve is guaranteed to have good energy is if he is high or drunk.

What is wrong with my roommate??? Happy to provide further examples upon request...

fr7hk1,artandmath,Would less people die if we stopped social isolation to keep the economy going?,"I've heard the argument, ignoring morals, that we should get everyone back working at their normal jobs in a week or two to keep the economy afloat through COVID-19. 

Currently the vast majority of deaths are above 65, which is in the decline of productivity. They are also the most financially stable, and capable of weathering the bad economics. While younger people who are just starting their careers are much more vulnerable to economic downturns and the effects of that. 

Decline of the economy would lead to deaths through it's own means such as the great depression. Would it offset the people saved through large scale measures from the government, which looks like it might not always be effective looking at Italy and Spain lock-downs. 

Those who are most effected by the economy are generally the ones who are most productive. 

**TLDR:** Would less people die if we managed to avoid a depression instead of stopping the spread of COVID? Are we sacrificing the young productive yet economically vulnerable population, to save the older less productive economically stable population.",4,1585495310,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fr7hk1/would_less_people_die_if_we_stopped_social/,NoStupidQuestions,1

fr6uec,PyroFreakMM,Why does our current culture seemingly want to impede progress for a better life?,"This may just be the news cycle propaganda finally getting to me after so long in quarantine but.... 

TLDR at the bottom

It seems like every single year, there’s been opportunities for people in higher powers to help not just their own country, but humanity as a whole from progressing into a more efficient society?

For obvious examples, GameStop wanting to try hard not to close doors (which I *think* could be because of Amazon but that’s another point), President Cheeto actively using his power to prevent certain groups from getting aid and only using this pandemic to get richer (was gonna be #1 but I wanna save my eyes from politically charged comments), people like Jeff Bezos, [THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_richest_Americans_in_history), isn’t able to reimburse workers for their time while also being the biggest ‘monopoly’ in the world, people.... no.... [DOCTORS](https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/fr1abl/er_doctor_who_criticized_bellingham_hospitals/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) getting fired for criticizing a obviously broken system, and in the U.S. those who are trying to better the lives of others (Congress, Senate, doctors, governors, hospitals, [bad cuz idk how to use etc.] etc.) being held back from doing so and require a Chain of Command to be allowed to do their job properly?

Most of this applies to our pandemic situation but here are some other examples.

•Climate change denial and lack of significant action (seemingly)
•Those at the top being oligopolies with the same traits as monopolies (*cough* Amazon *cough*) 
•Destruction of individual privacy
•Unfair chance for those with nothing to start something big (businesses mainly)
•Specific: That one WHO guy with the weirdest interview, highlighting how those up top aren’t as reliable as we’d like.

And most importantly:

• Why does it seem like we can’t do anything about it? Why can’t we, individual people, use the systems put in place to properly receive what it is that we need? How did it get this bad.

OKAY! Now that I’ve probably turned this into a rant I’d like to say this. I’m probably not fully mature or understanding to fully grasp these concepts but if at least one of my points was built upon, I’d have my thirst quenched. 

TLDR: Why do I feel like Im living in the Twilight Zone this past decade? It may just be quarantine getting to me but it seems like there’s something previously thought to be unbelievable becoming believable and becomes reality.

There are many instances where the repeat the same sentence many times for no reason, stutter at an insignificant word for about 5 times, stilted words and phrasing, so many fucking long dramatic pauses when nothing is dramatic about the scene, and boring talk that has nothing to do with the story or the characters. I live in an arabic country and i hate about the arabic movies and series that they have everything set to perfect except the dialogue. Perfect acting and editing and cinematography but the dialogue makes you lose interest in the whole thing. That is why i prefer watching english and american television.

fr4gxl,gh0stieeh,Motorbikes and quarentine,"Hi. Quarantine question. May be long, sorry.

So. I'm living in Australia where our government is slowing increasing the lockdown levels.  I'm about to get my motorbike learners license. This licence costs a fair amount of money (for me) and lasts for only 15 months. I can't cancel getting my learners without loosing this money. At the end of that time, either you pass your test to get your full licence, or you pay and start the process over again.

Currently in an internal debate with myself whether I should go ahead and buy a motorbike and start riding.

Considerations :
° I am a nervous person, so probably the first month or 2 will be me riding the back streets very slowly around my neighbourhood.
° I have no other transport and if public transit is locked down, I won't have many ways to get places I need to go. EG Court, medical appointments, etc.
° If I buy a bike, it'll be from a dealer, and I will do so with a N95 mask on, and with a lot of use of hand sanitizer.
° the roads are very quiet now, so I'll be able to build up confidence a lot easier.
° it will make me happy and give me a goal to achieve during a 3 month plus lockdown. It will get me out of the house and help keep my mental health slightly more level.
° I won't be using this time to go to places to hang out. Maybe to pick up groceries if that's still allowed, otherwise, just to and from my house.
° if I end up in a crash, I may either not have access to medical resources, or take those resources from someone else.
° Leaving my house just to ride is kinda selfish, even if I don't intentionally come into contact with anyone else (crashing, or getting groceries/ doing appointments aside.)
° filling up with fuel may put me or others at risk of transmission. 

° other things I haven't thought of??

Any guidance on this? Please be gentle, all my goals and dreams have been taken from me this year, and this is the only one I have left, hence why I'm not immediately just letting go of it.

 But from years of scrolling through activist instagram/twitter as well as being pretty engaged in their comments, i get the idea that these two things are pretty fundamental: Supporting immigration and cultural acceptance of immigrants and their lifestyles, as well as supporting and accepting POC, womens liberation, and the LGBTQ.

But these two things are bound to clash, considering pretty much every African, Middle Eastern, and Asian culture is to varying degrees homophobic, sexist, racist, etc. It's quite impossible to fully normalize these cultures without being accepting or at least complacent of these things

i feel way more attractive around guys than around girls

some of them get nervous, some of them feel uncomfortable, many of them are nice to me for no reason. tho also some of them get triggered by me easily, want to fight me, have eyes full of hate. all in all, i get way more attention from guys than girls

girls have treated me shit all my life

also another question, can a girl ignore you or even treat you badly in response to you not caring about her?

cuz honestly, i have noticed that lots of girl have started liking me only after i started paying attention to them (by paying attention i mean just maybe making a brief eye contact)

i have never ever called a girl ugly (even tho they have done it to me) but they have always been mean to me like i actually have done it. honestly, i really haven't cared much about most girls around me all my life, cuz i honestly i didn't think that they were attractive, i didn't take them seriously. tho again i have NEVER directly said it, did they sense it and did it trigger them?

its so weird and frustrating. lowkey girls are the reason why i had/have some insecurities in my life, cuz they have treated me like shit.

I remember being around 10 and watching the south park episode where cartman joins nambla and wishing that I could join a group like that. 

I was “molested” at a young age by a trusted male  family member even though I enjoyed it and would continue to seek his company since he never hurt me or abused me

As I got older my male school mates and I would play sexually but more than just Casual “I will show you mine if you show me yours” routine. We would have sex which was from around 10-14

Am I a bad person for this? Should I seek help? 

Sometimes I feel like a scumbag for having thoughts that I know are horribly wrong/disgusting but it’s hard to prevent a thought.

fr1xsv,WeirdQuestionthrow1,"Why do a lot of extremely attractive women date relatively unattractive men, but it's rarely the other way around?","Yes, whether or not you find someone attractive is subjective, but, let's be honest, if you were to throw out a poll asking if Margot Robbie is beautiful, most people would say yes. 

This is a serious question though. I know SO many couples where the woman is the equivalent of Margot Robbie and the man is the equivalent of Jack Black (all looks-wise). I've maybe seen one or two couples in my lifetime where the woman would be Rebel Wilson and the man would be Pierce Brosnan, George Clooney, insert Hollywood heartthrob. Yeah, I know, looks aren't everything, but they seem to be with a lot of guys. I mean jeez, I even know Margot Robbie types dating unconventionally attractive guys that are complete douches. I just don't get it. 

Is this a psychological or socialization thing? Does anyone have an explanation? I get why a dime of a woman might date a relatively unattractive guy because yes, looks aren't everything. But I mean seriously, think about it, how many (young) Pierce Brosnans do you know that are dating Rebel Wilsons? I have a feeling it's a socialization thing since women's beauty standards have changed throughout history. 

P.S. Rebel Wilson and Jack Black are both hilarious and extremely talented, and I'm sure they're both wonderful, smart people. However, they're not conventionally attractive (at least in the 21st-century U.S.)",6,1585466354,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fr1xsv/why_do_a_lot_of_extremely_attractive_women_date/,NoStupidQuestions,1

I would like to say, at no point in time, did I ever send items back or like cancel my audiobooks/kindle books and ask for a refund. I did not do price gouging or reselling on amazon marketplace.

We basically keep going round and round with variations of ""loving husband, father, grandfather"" and ""loved by his family"" and it all just sounds like we're mourning him. It doesnt help that we want to include his name, bday, and member ID for the program related to the convention.

It’s almost like they forget about us, until there’s some war and then they go, “oh yeah, we have this chunk of the population that should die for us!”

Take the stimulus for example: I have many friends, living on their own, either graduated or still in college who were claimed as a dependent on their parent’s 2019 taxes. These people are still paying rent and tuition out of pocket but are on their parent’s insurance and the like. Therefore, they don’t qualify to get any assistance. Neither does their family because they’re not children. 

Some are still being charged rent or tuition or other things by schools while “regular adults” have rent frozen.

And it’s not even that- I’m sure if I wanted to I could come up with a big list of things that have benefitted all other taxpaying adults older than about 23. I’m just sick of being ignored by my own government.",8,1585459203,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fr0iei/why_does_it_seem_like_the_us_government_always/,NoStupidQuestions,1

fr07y7,cosmicsoylatte,Helping out a stranger with a pre-paid phone--bad idea?,"Hey guys,

Yikes I feel stupid posting this even here.  So earlier today I ran into someone without a place to live.  I gave him some money and we chatted a bit.  He seemed incredibly sweet and like he might be new to the lifestyle (although idk for sure).  Said he was running out of hope and thinking of giving up, which tugged at my heart.  I gave him the number to a local suicide hotline, and asked him if he had a phone.  Unfortunately he did not.  

For some reason I just really felt like I had to do something besides offering an empty gesture, so my mind immediately went to getting a prepaid phone.  I told him I would be right back.  Picked one up and got a plan.  Was thinking I could set it to fixed dialing so that only 211, some good local agencies and some hotlines could be reached through the phone.  No cigar (should have checked whether the phone supports that before I even bought it).  I feel bad leaving the dude there and with the phone all ready to go, I really want to drive back and give it to him.   But I'm worried I could be held liable if he or anyone else uses that phone to do something illegal.  I'm thinking of just getting one that does support fixed dialing and finding him another day.

I ended having this discussion with my friend, who told me it’s a generational thing.

I'm very romantically depressed because I'm not really socially adept enough to do anything and considering my financial situation I feel like a loser.

I want to know if it'd be a good idea to rent an apartment for the summer instead of move back with my mother, and have that be my ""moving out"" experience. I have a job pending with the census and can always fall back on my waiter job plus during the school year, room board and tuition is about $10,000 a year.

Is moving out a good idea or should I just sit the summer at home with my mother. I just want to start being an adult and growing as a person, I feel like I'm very passive in life with everything and just try to make others feel better without considering what I want at all. My mother was not able to graduate high school so she insists on paying for my college and housing me, which is a great benefit, but I can't help but feel like a complete loser for it.

TL;DR   I feel like a loser who has failed to grow as an adult and is completely behind in life. Would moving out over the summer and finishing school be a good move?",3,1585450802,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fqyk31/have_i_been_in_a_bubble/,NoStupidQuestions,1

Ok so due to covid-19, I no longer have any shifts at the job that I had just been employed at. I really want a little bit of money, for myself and in case my parents lose their jobs or their hours are cut, so I thought why not sell feet pics? My parents are against it but I'm gonna try it out. I just have a few questions.

How do customers pay - do I need to get paypal or can I just send my bsb and account number and they can transfer the money?

Where do I find customers/where is the best place to advertise? Craigslist, reddit...?

How do I send the photos? I used a camera so the photos are quite high resolution and will be too big to send over email. Can I just put the photos in a google drive folder then send the link?

How should I price the photos? My feet aren't the prettiest but the photos turned out decent. I was thinking $5 per photo, $20 for 5, $40 for 10. Also can I say no refunds?

I know I can just look up the answers to these questions (I have), but I'd like some opinions. Thanks!",1,1585450073,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fqydiu/questions_about_selling_feet_pics/,NoStupidQuestions,1

I've noticed within recent years that my taste when it comes to coffee, tea, and alcohol, seem to have one thing in common: I can't.

Well, that's being dramatic. Basically, when it comes to coffee and tea, I can only taste hot bitter water. There are exceptions to these, like blueberry tea, lemon tea, chamomile, french vanilla, mocha. When it comes to alcohol, it's just a very specific taste universally with hints of the intended flavor (Though that may be the purpose of an alcoholic beverage, in which case, enlighten me on my stupidity.) All I typically taste is straight alcohol. The base ingredient, so to speak. 

Question here is a two-parter. One, is there anything specifically wrong with my sense of taste? Totally cool if it is, but I would rather know. Two, is there any possible solutions for what I am experiencing?

fqwpez,howdygoose,How strong do I need to be to confidently physically restrain a large (70lb-90lb) dog?,"Might be getting a dog soon, and I've always dreamed of getting a large breed, but I'm worried I won't be able to physically handle the dog's pulling strength. 

I've never owned a dog, but I've trained three different dogs of my friends. Two were puppies, and one was a 3 year old. I taught only one command to the 3 year old, and it was down. His owner said he was ""untrainable"". The puppies were kinda the more recent, and real training experiences. I taught them separately, but in a similar way. I worked on obedience like sit, stay, wait, down, leave it, and some simple tricks. Since I trained these puppies during visits at friends' place, for fun, I didn't get to try anything that is long term training, like crate training, and potty training. I tried some leash training, and it worked for a while, but the dogs were handled by others who didn't enforce the ""rules"", keep it consistent, and  eventually they'd start pulling again, so it felt like a lost cause. 

So now, I'm somewhat confident in my dog training ability. All those dogs were small breeds. I gotta be sure I can handle a large dog,  before I get one. All dogs are great, but if I get to pick and choose, I want a big dog. 

Unfortunately, I'm not confident in my strength. I'm 160lb, and I can do 1 pull up, and 3 chinups, but only with a break in the middle. Could I handle a large dog, lunging at something unexpected, while always on leash? What if the leash is long, and he's running at full speed?",7,1585443660,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/fqwpez/how_strong_do_i_need_to_be_to_confidently/,NoStupidQuestions,1

Then he suggested I get a different tv, same specs, for $1,300. I told him I really didn’t feel like paying that much and he told me there was a $800 option and I really shouldn’t consider the $500. I don’t really remember why, but something about latency. 

The weirdest thing, is the $500 tv has a perfect 5 stars on their website. I’m sure he was trying to upsell but the whole thing put me off.

Since I’ve caught wind of COVID-19 and the destructive path it’s left behind, I've been troubled by my future career. I wouldn’t say I’ve been depressed but extremely conflicted with my career choice to a point where loved ones notice a difference in my emotional well being.

Not to be dramatic, but I feel very helpless, and it bothers me. Before making my career change, I wanted to be an ER nurse. Nursing requires AT LEAST two years of school to receive your RN and the way the world is moving; a BSN is starting to become the norm. I mention this because it will take at the very least two years even to begin practicing, and (hopefully) this pandemic will be long gone, but there will always be another COVID-19.

Who decided that human lives are more valuable than other animals’ lives?,"Why do people who believe so strongly in the idea of consent and who are also probably the biggest proponents of science completely ignore the fact that most of their science is based on the exploitation of laboratory animals who never gave their consent to be used for experimental purposes?

The most common response I see is that it’s a necessary evil. Yes it might be horrible what we do to these rats but it is worth it since we save human lives. In my opinion humans do far more harm for the world than good. We are almost solely responsible for global warming, all wars and forms of terrorism, poverty, and basically every bad thing.

You might say we have improved on gay rights and race relations and that wealth inequality is better now than it was a hundred years ago. But the fact that homophobia and racism and even the concept of wealth and power exist in the first place is solely due to humanity, these are abstract concepts created by the human race.

It’s just not fair to these laboratory animals. They never consented to this. They just want to live their regular rat lives and not be tortured for scientific purposes.

And I'm not alone on this. A lot of fellow D&amp;D nerds that I've talked to have mentioned their need to collect more dice, no matter how many there are in their possession.
