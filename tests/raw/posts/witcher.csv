fsnkc6,guven09_Mr,DLC's are a lot better than Main Story in Witcher 3....,"Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine were flawless.

O'Dimm and Olgierd's story were interesting, dark and mysterious. Final Boss were great. Greatly thought. Greatly crafted. Both O'Dimm and Olgierd's characters were greatly written.

Blood and Wine in the other hand, has a awesome map and the most enjoyable missions and side activities. Regis was a big plus, also Detlaff. Detlaff boss fight was awesome and also hard. I can still spend 30 more hours in Toussaint.

But When I look main story of game I find some points I didn't like.

First, I can't be the only who disliked this 'finding' business.

Find Yennefer.

Find Ciri.

Find Bloody Baron to find Ciri.

Find Bloody Baron's wife and daughter to find Ciri.

Find Dandellion so you can find Ciri.

Find Dudu so you can find Dandellion, so you can find Ciri.

Find clues in Skellige so you can find Ciri.

To be honest after some point I was like 'Enough!'

Well... I should start with saying Battle of Kaer Morhen was the peak of the game for me. And I would really want game to end there because final battle (On Thin Ice) didn't feel impressive like Kaer Morhen. And most importantly, first stages of game makes you feel that game will end in Kaer Morhen( Geralt's dream in the beginning). Even because of this, I sent Letho and Keira to Morhen earlier for just in case. When I learned a battle will happen there I was super hyped. And when game continued after Morhen, I was like ' How they will manage to create a atmosphere like this one?'  In my opinion, after Morhen, generally the main missions were just extensions unnecessarly. Vesemir dying for nothing, saving Philippa from Dijkstra, Margarita from prison, Fringilla from Emyr and yet they didn't do anything in the final Battle even if they did, we didn't see anything. We convince Ge'els but yet we didn't his effect directly in the final battle too. Eredin boss fight was a little bit easy. Geralt and Ciri should have fight Eredin together in the final boss fight of the game don't you think?.Even Imlerith boss fight were a lot harder. I loved the game but I think it would be a lot impressive if Gerald and Ciri fought Eredin together in the final Battle at Morhen. Wild Hunt getting defeated at Witcher's Castle... It would be super cool.

Yet.... I fucking love Witcher Series..

fsn6ss,PubliusVirgilius,"[Spoilers] Some thoughts about the ""Empress"" ending","Its interesting that everyone assumes that the Empress ending means, that Ciri is actually crowned empress.
But in this Blood and Wine end dialogue, Ciri is still not empress and has doubts about the whole thing:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JIo88o2V0Qw

This means that the ending where Ciri accepts the offer of Emhyr, (but changes her mind afterwards) could be the canonical ending for a future game.

This would also mean this ending doesn't contradict the books, where in the future Ciri is remembered as a witchress and not Empress.",17,1585694735,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fsn6ss/spoilers_some_thoughts_about_the_empress_ending/,witcher,2

fslgn1,StellarMind1010,[MAJOR SPOILERS] I just finished the base game for the second time... In two weeks.,"For a while i wanted to play The Witcher 3, everyone was praising it and then I watched the TV show, I really enjoyed it and liked the characters a lot. Being locked inside my home, as many of you are right now I guess (well you better isolate yourself if not!!) I decided it's the perfect moment to embark on a new journey and oh boy... On my first playthrough, after playing around 90 hours, finishing all the posible quests of the base game I was so sure of myself that I'm gonna get a happy ending (I really didn't knew anything about them) and then I'm gonna download the dlc's, but well, well, unfortunately I didn't, instead I got the worst possible one. It really destroyed me for a day, it played with my emotions, especially because right after Gerald is swarmed by monsters you spawn at Kaer Morhen, which is empty, and that song was cutting into my heart. I didn't had any save around the Battle for KM in order to make different choices so basically I had to start on a save in Velen which was just 9 hours in. It's the first time in my life I started a second playthrough for a game of such a size so early after finishing it. Usually if I am putting more than 50 hours into a game I just leave it there for months, even if I loved it a lot, I will be just to tired. But I wanted to get the good ending... I just couldn't stand the fact that Ciri died in my playthrough. All in all it was an amazing experience, which even managed to teach me a few lessons, now i'm again feeling empty, my character alone in Kaer Morhen with that beautiful music in the background, but this time it all comes with a sense of pride now.",3,1585689178,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fslgn1/major_spoilers_i_just_finished_the_base_game_for/,witcher,4

fskm5c,hurrrrrmione,[Help] Crossbow bug(s) in Blood and Wine tournament archery competition,"I'm losing this competition every time because of two different problems with the crossbow.

One I've had for the entire base game and also showed up in the Hearts of Stone quest to recruit Eveline Gallo the Ermine. Geralt frequently puts the crossbow away after one shot. Annoying af but it wasn't a real problem until now because I never use the crossbow in regular combat. I practiced this event twice and both times I managed to hit all the targets in the allotted time despite this issue. 

However, in the actual competition, a second bug is cropping up. Geralt keeps getting stuck [pointing the crossbow off to the side and I get a ""can't do that now"" message.](https://imgur.com/a/pWTJmKt) I try putting away the bow, I try aiming, and he doesn't do anything. Sometimes he'll eventually put away the bow, but after I pull it out again I'll get one shot in and he'll get stuck again.

Apologies if this is a frequently asked question. I tried Googling and I see the tournament had many bugs initially, but I didn't find any mention of the specific issues I'm encountering.

There was already a post about this a year ago but with no clear answer as to how to actually find the treasure and get the marker to disappear:

Apparently it is still there, non-interactable. Probably was a part of some test that the devs didn't erase completely. I tried googling it to see if any body else knows what the deal is, but all the results are about that glowing ghost ship you can see somewhere else in skellige.

What do you think this was there for?

fsf1el,luffie-edric,Just finished Witcher 4.... sorry i mean Blood &amp; Wine,"It's absolutely fantastic, it's much better paced than the base game, and has a more satisfying confrontation and conclusion. 

The music, the quests, the endings, it's just so incredible. So good that it also highlights the poorest part of WItcher 3, the combat. The progress to Dettlaff was great, and the battle isn't too shabby either, but I just can't shake off the annoyance with the movement and combat feedback, after playing games like SoulsBorneKiro and DMC. When they make a new Witcher game, they should really polish this, because everything else is already top notch.

And it saddens me quite a bit to know that it's the end, so much so that I actually went to every single point on the map and do every single quest, just because I hate to part with it. 

***If any, is there anything else I can do to play more Witcher 3, to lengthen and enrich my adventure other than NG+?***

Witcher 3 was good example that CDPR actually listen to players' feedback. Thanks to this we have for example toxicity level affecting Geralt's face. 

First we could gather potential subjects to discuss. For example:

- Alchemy

- Combat

- World (this is huge topic that might be even divided for more specified elements)

- Music

- Weather system

- Other gameplay elements, like Gwent

Im not sure though when would be potentially best time to start these discussions. Development process will probably last around 4 years. I tought about starting some time after Cyberpunk release.

fs3byv,evictedfrommyaccount,Sexism in the Witcher 3,"As a woman who loves rpgs, I played the Witcher 3 last year and decided to replay it again, and both times I am shocked by the sexism in the game, and especially its over sexualisation. 

And I am also shocked by the few number of people pointing that out. I read some old thread, and people were discussing it, but I would like to add things to it. Yes the number of females being sexualised outweighs the number of males. As I do understand for witches, I do want to point out certain characters namely Ciri, Corinne, Ves and the Bloody Baron. 

Ciri is Geralt's daughter by choice as he calls her. Meaning ''our'' daughter, as the player controlling Geralt. Why do I have to see her naked/wearing a revealing bra? She's the character to especially not sexualize due to the role she is filling as a character. And that mention of Geralt wanting her by the Crones... Why was that necessary? Because they are disgusting bitches who want to bone? As if we (the player) don't already know that.

Corinne is a witch, yes, but she can also fulfill the role of a care taker/mom to Sarah, the godling. Can't she wear a bit of clothes since she can be affiliated to the role of a mom? I don't want to bang a mom. I don't want to think of that. Why, from all the witches there are, is she the one with the least amount of clothes? 

Ves. She's not a witch. She's not trying to seduce Geralt/the player. Nor does she try to use her sexy outfit to her advantage. So why would she dress like a whore, and not like wear something that could protect her since she's a soldier. 

And the Bloody Baron. There is no excuses for him. I pity him, I do, but damn, he doesn't deserve a happy ending. He beated his wife before the war, as Tamara said, and she (Anna) found comfort in the arms of another. The thing is, she didn't lie to him. She just fled. With her daughter (understandable, you wouldn't want to leave your child to a violent man your child hates) and a man who cared for her. And he found them. Took her last chance of happiness away by murdering her lover. And then he raped her (since she was cold and distant I don't believe that child was conceived during an act of love). And you, as the player, will always something along the lines '' yeah she was a bitch, but so are you '' to the Baron. And fuck no. She is a desperate woman who lost everything due to man she did no longer love. She is absolutely not a despicable woman. And, being the most wronged, the person who was given the least amount of choices, she also does not have a say on what her future will be at the end of the quest. Will she die horribly? Will she be forced to stay with a man, who we don't know if she wants that, having lost all her sanity? So why would the game give her such a horrible ending when the Bloody Baron can either die (and he deserves it) or try to help his wife (without giving her a say in this as always)?

She's painted in a dark grey light when the game does its best to give a lighter greyish light to the Bloody Baron (ciri's side meant for the player to sympathize with him/geralt's sympathizing too).

So, to go back to the oversexualization of women, I am aware of the argument ''Geralt is sexualized too so its fine''. It isn't. The 1st images you see Yen's ass and also boobs. You also see Geralt topless. You don't see his ass though, they are cutting that. Why can't I see Geralt's fine ass? I want to see it, I'm sure it's a piece of art. So show it to me.
Also on the topless topic, I can't count the number of women you can see topless in this game. I think there is only one man though, and it's Geralt.

Plus how many fine men are in this game? Geralt? And Vernon maybe? Where are my fine men?

I don't care about oversexualization with no purpose if it's on both sides.

Although I do care a lot for the messages it sends to the player. If it arms the narrative, please don't oversexualize, would it be women or men. If it's fucking baffling for the message it sends for abused women, please think twice, don't let it slide.

Love fantasy rpgs and this one definitely blows everything else out of the water.

Seriously can‚Äôt think of a better quarantine investment. It‚Äôs been about 4 days now but I‚Äôve probably already played almost 30 hours no joke.

Right now I‚Äôm looking for dandelion and Dudu, so I‚Äôve definitely made some progress but not super far along. I LOVED the whole bloody baron thing and I‚Äôm still fixated on how perfectly creepy the crones were (I didn‚Äôt fuck up this quest btw), so much so that I‚Äôve been listening to their theme song while driving.

Anyway....I know there are a lot of choices in the game. I know there is a bad ending possible that I want to avoid at all costs. I am curious if there is anything you guys wish you had/had not done that I, as a Witcher noob, should avoid. 

Something I did is *spoiler!!!!* let Whoreson live and I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs going to come back to haunt me.

frywjl,HansHortio,[Books Spoilers - Tower of the Swallow] Anyone else content with the end result pertaining to a certain rodent gang?,"In regards to this discussion, if you haven't read the books namely Baptism by Fire and especially The Tower of the Swallow, stop now.  I'm about to get pretty ranty and spoiler-ey

The purpose of this discussion is to just get this off my chest, since I honestly think I need to type, share and discuss a few things about the books, and namely, Ciri and the Rats, just so I can be done with it and move on.  I originally played all the Witcher games, and decided to read the books before doing my next play though.  I'm absolutely loving the books, which might be why I'm getting so emotionally invested in the whole thing.

I've just started The Tower of the Swallow, and although I don't know exactly what happened, Ciri has mentioned to the hermit that all her friends (The Rats) were butchered.  And the moment she said that, I was pretty pleased.  Not ""jumping for joy"" pleased, but more of a ""got their just desserts"" pleased.  As much as Andrzej Sapkowski did try and highlight that these are all orphans and outcasts (And I can acknowledge some of his points, to boot), I admit I had a very, very hard time sympathising with ANY of the Rats.  They were literal bandits, murders and rapists.  I never bought Ciri's ""romance"" with Mistle, considering the foundation of that little love-fest was rape (Can you imagine one of Harvey Weinstein's victims getting a tattoo above their pelvis to remember him by? ), and they fostered an environment that turned Ciri into a robber and a hot headed murderer.  Heck, maybe that's why I loathe the Rats so much:  They are one of several people and situations who twisted a sweet young girl that I found endearing into someone I'm starting to actively dislike, at least on a moral scale. 

Like I said, I'm early into the books.  Maybe something will come up that will make me sympathise with the Rats a bit more.  Also, morally speaking, it would be more preferable if they were imprisoned or redeemed themselves in some way, but that didn't happen. 

Is anyone else satisfied about the comeuppance that was visited on the Rats?",12,1585601181,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/frywjl/books_spoilers_tower_of_the_swallow_anyone_else/,witcher,1

frwhub,varJoshik,"Tir n√° B√©a Arainne, Ciri's Escape in Lady of the Lake &amp; How the Hell do Prophecies Work?","I am confused on several accounts.

&amp;nbsp;

In Tower of the Swallow, under Mount Gorgon, Geralt‚Äôs being summoned by Avallac‚Äôh for a conversation, which gives rise to my first question: for what purpose, exactly?

During this conversation, the elf who can predict the future *accurately* more or less spoils the ending of the books.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 
&gt;!    *‚ÄòWill I get Ciri back?‚Äô*
&gt; 
&gt;!    *The answer was immediate.*
&gt; 
&gt;!    *‚ÄòYou will. Only to lose her at once. And to be clear: forever; irrevocably. Before it comes to that, you will lose everybody who accompanies you. You will lose one of your companions in the next few weeks, perhaps even days. Perhaps even hours.‚Äô*
&gt; 
&gt;!    *‚ÄòThank you.‚Äô*
&gt; 
&gt;!    *‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt finished yet. The direct effect of your interference in the grinding querns of the Purpose and the Plan will be the death of tens of thousands of people. Which, as a matter of fact, does not matter much, since soon after, tens of millions of people will lose their lives. The world as you know it will simply vanish, cease to exist in order ‚Äì after a suitable time has passed ‚Äì to revive in a totally different form. But in fact no one has, nor will have, any influence on it, no one is capable of preventing it nor staving off the course of events. Not you, not I, not sorcerers nor Sages. Not even Ciri.‚Äô*

&amp;nbsp;

He even shows Geralt a vision of where Ciri is (headed), and then helps the witcher get to Caed Myrkvid on time, even though neither of these actions should, presumably, be in his interests.

OTOH, before all of this, Avallac‚Äôh lets Geralt know in no uncertain terms that his rescue expedition is meaningless because ‚Äò*the serious evil has already occurred*‚Äô (trauma to Ciri?), that Ciri can cope wonderfully by herself, and that someone else (him, most likely) is helping her now. So, despite knowing what will happen, is he still going through the motions out of sheer curiosity? (He is interested ‚Äò*to see what a pebble falling in the gears of the querns can accomplish*‚Äô (pp.245).) The entire segment feels almost like authorial self-insertion in the sense that only the author truly ‚Äúknows‚Äù the fate of their characters and story.

So again: **what was the purpose of summoning Geralt for this entire conversation?**

&amp;nbsp;

Secondly, and this is where it gets crackpot for me, since Avallac'h sees the future, he must also know that Ciri will escape from Tir na Lia (&amp; Geralt gets her back &amp; promptly loses her forever). Presumably, it would be in Avallac‚Äôh‚Äôs interest to stop it ‚Äì **why doesn‚Äôt he?**

There are two interesting parallels, or mirroring acts, between Geralt‚Äôs and Ciri‚Äôs journey in that bit of Lady of the Lake:

1. Geralt, before finding the listening room in Toussaint, stumbles upon skulls and skeletons in a mass grave in the old elven ruin (Toussaint being built on elven ruins), which would make the skeletons most likely elven. Ciri, when fleeing from Tir na Lia, finds herself in the middle of a mass grave as well ‚Äì the result of a genocide the Aen Elle perpetrated against humans.


2. Then there‚Äôs the ‚Äòlight‚Äô that shows the way out.

  &gt; *‚ÄòBy all the means‚Ä¶ Leave this way. Tread toward the light. Metaphorically or literally, that is usually the right way.‚Äô* ‚Äì Avallac‚Äôh to Geralt
  &gt; 
  &gt; *‚ÄòA furious gallop, eyes watering from speed. Lightning spilt the sky in two. ‚Ä¶ Kelpie neighs wildly. The unicorn replies. There is a snow-white dot in the gloom. It points the way.‚Äô* ¬≠‚Äì Ciri fleeing from Tir na Lia with Ihuarraquax and Kelpie

&amp;nbsp;

When Ciri escapes via river water to the flashing of lightning showing the way (as well as that ‚Äúsnow-white dot in the gloom‚Äù (?)), she has arguably gotten the idea because she has been taken on a boat ride rather far away from Tir na Lia once before. She even notes during that little boat ride that they have drifted far away (all the while counting the bridges just as during her escape) and that it is time to pick up the oars. At her decision to turn around Avallac‚Äôh snaps his fingers and the boat turns back toward Tir na Lia, moving against the current effortlessly now. Had Ciri not made the decision, it looks like they would have just kept on drifting. So her idea to escape comes at least partly via Avallac‚Äôh‚Äôs solicitation.

Which is surprising, given that he must know, just as Eredin does, that the river can carry one beyond the protective barrier. And it should not be in his interests to even give a single hint of anything like that being possible for Ciri. Furthermore, when Ciri actually does escape, the one mage that could just snap his fingers and turn the boat around is conveniently absent.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt; *‚ÄòWhere did you learn that, Swallow?‚Äô*
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äò*You‚Äôd be astonished.‚Äô*
&gt; 
&gt; *‚ÄòI doubt it. Was it your idea that the barrier can be overcome by sailing along the river, or did someone reveal it to you?‚Äô*
&gt; 
&gt; *‚ÄòIt doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äô*
&gt; 
&gt; *‚ÄòIt does. And let‚Äôs get to the bottom of it. There are methods for doing that.‚Äô*

&amp;nbsp;

Again, given everything we know, what he himself has told Geralt, Avallac‚Äôh should already know that Ciri will escape (did he also foresee Auberon‚Äôs death?), but now I am bizarrely wondering if he might have actually, unwittingly or not, aided it along. And if that is partly the reason that CDPR went with the character development that they gave him for the games in their fanfiction continuation of the story.",3,1585593704,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/frwhub/tir_n√°_b√©a_arainne_ciris_escape_in_lady_of_the/,witcher,1

frun32,guven09_Mr,Personally I find DLC'S a lot more successfull than main storyline.," Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine were flawless.

O'Dimm and Olgierd's story were interesting, dark and mysterious. Final Boss were great. Greatly thought. Greatly crafted. Both O'Dimm and Olgierd's characters were greatly written.

Blood and Wine in the other hand, has a awesome map and the most enjoyable missions and side activities. Regis was a big plus, also Datlaff. Datlaff boss fight was awesome and also hard. I can still spend 30 more hours in Toussiant.

But When I look main story of game I find some points I didn't like.

First, I can't be the only who disliked this 'finding' business.

Find Yennefer.
Find Ciri.
Find Bloody Baron to find Ciri.
Find Bloody Baron's wife and daughter to find Ciri.
Find Dandellion so you can find Ciri.
Find Dudu so you can find Dandellion, so you can find Ciri.
Find clues in Skellige so you can find Ciri.

To be honest after some point I was like 'Enough!'

Well... I should start with saying Battle of Kaer Morhen was the peak of the game for me. And I would really want game to end there because final battle (On Thin Ice) didn't feel impressive like Kaer Morhen. And most importantly, first stages of game makes you feel that game will end in Kaer Morhen( Geralt's dream in the beginning). Even because of this, I sent Letho and Keira to Morhen earlier for just in case. When I learned a battle will happen there I was super hyped. And when game continued after Morhen, I was like ' How they will manage to create a atmosphere like this one?'  In my opinion, after Morhen, generally the main missions were just extensions unnecessarly. Vesemir dying for nothing, saving Philippa from Dijkstra, Margarita from prison, Fringilla from Emyr and yet they didn't do anything in the final Battle even if they did, we didn't see anything. We convince Ge'els but yet we didn't his effect directly in the final battle too. Eredin boss fight was a little bit easy. Geralt and Ciri should have fight Eredin together in the final boss fight of the game don't you think?.Even Imlerith boss fight were a lot harder. I loved the game but I think it would be a lot impressive if Gerald and Ciri fought Eredin together in the final Battle at Morhen. Wild Hunt getting defeated at Witcher's Castle... It would be super cool.",4,1585587868,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/frun32/personally_i_find_dlcs_a_lot_more_successfull/,witcher,1

I worked on the basic mechanics, but without models and high-quality animations. I try to take as few resources as possible from The Witcher 3, and I want to have author's models in the game. Obviously, CD Project RED was allowed to be done only on their engine, because of this I refused to cooperate with them.

I'm playing the witcher 1 enhanced edition, and stuck on Chapter 2

I still have the quest of Vizima confidential and the description tells me ""To wait for the detective's investigation"", quote that doesn't make sense since I already know he's an impostor. When I talk to the impostor the only dialogue option I get is ""I'm ready to confront Ramsmeat"". But then again I already spoke to Ramsmeat and told him who the impostor was.

I've already played for about 5 days ""in-game time, not real life play time"", from when I told everyone who the Salamandra agent was and clearing all quests. And I have no quests to progress further. Already finished all Thaler, Shani's, the officer, gravekeeper, Ramsmeat, Carmen, Leuvaarden, Yaevinn, Siegfried,Vivaldi quests.

These channels only give the artists credit in the comments and sometimes in the description once they have received backlash for reposting the music (but not credit in the title, which will still display the music as OST)

I encourage this community that, if you are listening to the music by the fan artists, please go to their channels to listen to it (good to have a playlist of music so that it's easy to find each time)

fr9pye,adysouthy,"Start a GOTY from scratch, or buy DLC and continue then NG+?","I cocked up. 

I just finished the base game and wanted to obviously play the DLC. I checked where was cheapest and saw a GOTY edition code download from CDKeys for ¬£17. This was cheaper than buying the DLCs separately themselves so I got it. Once installed I then realised your saved games don't transfer from the base game to the GOTY.... 

So now I have two options. 

1. Start a brand new game from scratch on the GOTY edition, bringing over none of my saved progress from the standard edition. I get all the content out the box, but then obviously need to re-rank up

2. Buy the DLC separately (Another ¬£17) and link it to my saved progress char lvl 35. Continue playing the DLC and complete the game fully. 
2a) I also have the glitch where I can't get the Wolf school gear on this save, which is even more frustrating. 

I'm learning towards option 1, but that's a massive pain as I wanted to finish the game altogether and then play NG+ after all the DLCs. I aren't gunna get round to NG+ any time soon after sinking that much time back into it. 

So probably the main question . 

Is NG+ that good, that I should sink another ¬£17 into my base game and play the DLC? Do you get any extra gear and the like? 

Or should I just play the GOTY

I can't seem to find a map which has a scale on it and can't recall any hints in TW1-3 (or is there a note on how long it takes Geralt to get to Toussaint?) or the two short story books (I never read the rest of the books). I wanted to take a look at the distance between Oxenfurt and Novigrad ingame but it showed me less than 1400 &lt;icon of two feet&gt;. I don't know the unit of the ingame distance but it can hardly be feet, as this would be less than 430m. 1.4km also doesn't seem right while 1400km seem a bit much. I tried different imperial units but none of them make too much sense. So I guess the ingame markers aren't a good way to measure the world map. Sure, you only walk a short time but I guess this has to be due to the limitations of a video Game.

I finished the quest,&gt;! killing Cynthia for what she did to Triss,!&lt; collected all the notes for the Tome of Dearhenna quest, and left for the above-ground. The journal says to either keep the tome or sell it. I did a bit of research, and the fact that keeping the tome doesn't end the quest intrigued me. What intrigued me even further is that there was absolutely nothing else that I could find aside from the fact that ""selling"" the tome nets you no XP or orens [according to the wiki](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Tome_Truly_Rare). The closest I came to finding the end of this rabbit hole was a dead end post on this very subreddit where u/ohmerx asked [if there was any carryover into The Witcher 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/4kff6z/what_happen_to_dearhennas_book_from_witcher_2/).

**This is my first post ever; I apologize if I got the flair wrong**


So I am reading through the books for the first time (about to finish up with Sword of Destiny), while simultaneously playing Wild Hunt, so I'd say I'm still fairly new to the lore. 

One of the biggest questions I have that keeps recurring is this:

Are witchers truly devoid/incapable of emotion, or is it just a myth that Geralt doesn't bother to correct (either to hide his own feelings, as a convenience, etc)?

Is it a spoiler to know the answer? Should I just keep reading and playing and the answer will reveal itself?

fqne83,greatdominions,Question about NOT completing a quest related to Radovid...,"Hi all -- I am about 5 years late to playing Witcher 3 and am on my first play through! I was so amped to continue the main quest, that I opted to fail secondary quests to get through to the Isle of Mists and find Ciri. This meant that I failed the plot to assassinate Radovid because I did not complete the quest yet and it auto-failed.

I am really regretting that now. I hate seeing the Redanian soldiers and charred bodies around Novigrad. Would that have changed if I completed the assassination (and then sided with Roche or whatever)? I have googled this and can't find an answer. Right now I am level 31, completed the Battle of Kaer Morhen, killed whatshisface and the Crones, and started a little bit more on the main quest. My last save is level 20. I am considering going back to that save so I can complete it. But wondering if it's actually worth it for the storyline?

fqf8kk,Sanguiluna,Question about importing saves,"I‚Äôve played the first two games on PC but plan to do Wild Hunt on PS4 since it would run like shit on my computer. I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs an option in WH to simulate an AoK save by answering questions. But then I remembered that the Switch version has the cross-save option with Steam that PS4 doesn‚Äôt have. So my two questions are:

1. Theoretically, could I create a Wild Hunt save file on PC that imports my AoK save and then use that file on the Switch version, allowing me to play it on a console while still retaining continuity with my save files from the last two games?
2. If the answer to #1 is yes: Would it even be worth it? Is there any worthwhile differences between an imported save and a simulated save? Will an imported save have benefits to them, e.g. imported armor or weapons like they did with the TW1 import to AoK? I currently own WH on PS4, so if it turns out there isn‚Äôt any substantial difference or advantage, I‚Äôll just stick with PS4 and use the simulated save instead of repurchasing a game I already have.

I also appreciate that some of the books you pick up provide more context.

Is Witcher 3 a similar experience? In addition to the dialogue are there other components of the game that will give more of a backstory? I enjoyed the Netflix series and read the first book. I realize the game's timeline is a few years after the books wrap up, but If I read the whole series before I start Witcher 3, will I understand a good portion of the references they make?

fqdkws,DelayedScorpion,A review on my experience with The Witcher series so far,"After my recent finish of the Blood and Wine expansion, I figured it was time for me to post a small review on what I think of The Witcher series as of now. Why? Because I can't really tell anyone in my family about it, my friends are all too distant from me during quarantine, and I just need to get this out of my system. I would post this more as an appreciation thread but I also have to bring up some issues with what I've experience so I can't bring myself to that. Side note: this went on a lot longer than I anticipated to write so be warned of a long read.

Before beginning, a few things: Never have read the books before. Only got introduced to the name around Witcher 2 was out (was in a magazine or commercial I think). I first picked up all three games roughly 4 years ago now. Tried playing the first one but got very confused so I dropped it. Moved onto the second game because I remembered playing the demo of it on my Xbox back in the day. Dropped that one fairly quick too. Didn't really want to jump into the third game at that time without understanding the first two so I just held off. Heard about the series Netflix was making on the series, along with some troubling news about it and had doubts. When I came home for this past winter break I decided to watch it since it had come out at this time. And that's where my true experience began.

**NETFLIX SERIES**

After some debate over whether to watch it or not, I decided to give it a shot since I had already binged the Mandalorian. One of the best things I decided on. Overall, a very good show. I like that it goes more in-depth to the actual books and stories that were originally created than just rehashing the games, it gives fans of both the games and books more, along with trying to grab a new audience in a new format. Henry Cavill is does an amazing part at playing Geralt, the stories overall are very entertaining and memorable, and overall feels like something you would experience in the game. Did kind of take me for a loop as to who Jaskier was until I realized it was suppose to be Dandelion (apparently a mix of translation from original Polish to English from what I've come to understand). 

HOWEVER, I don't think it's absolutely perfect. There are small things in the show, like effects or tiny details that kind of make me question how something happened or just don't look right. But above all, and this has probably been discussed here before, was the choice of cast. Now, don't get me wrong, I think all the actors did fine and I don't mind seeing diversity when it comes to shows/movies. But if you're specifically changing characters skin tones/ethnicities for the sake of adding diversity instead of keeping as close to the source material, then I'm going to take issues.

So you have to understand my reaction when a number of characters appear to be black, yet when playing the games and looking up info on how these characters are suppose to be described in the books are having be more white, I'm going to have a somewhat perplexed or annoyed outlook on the situation. Especially when afterwards I learned that there are places in this world that can make people say there's diversity, mainly the region of Ofir and Zerrikania (as I come to understand, correct me if I'm wrong). The main setting in The Witcher series, as I come to understand, is set in very old medieval times, in a very old European style for this part of the created world. And I don't know about the rest of you, but when I think old medieval Europe, I do tend to think of a lot, if not all, white people wandering about. This basically boils down to the same situation with J.K. Rowling and turning Hermione black. Whatever, I've delved on this too long. 

In short, it's still a good show. I just have some gripes with it.

**WITCHER 1**

Picked this back up shortly after finished the Netflix series and after a bit of trouble shooting help from the subreddit here. In short, it definitely shows its age and is not the most well made game in the series but was still entertaining for what it was.

Story is simple. You, the Witcher who doesn't remember anything, have to track down and stop an evil organization who has wronged you and your friends and stop them from whatever plans they have with your stolen secrets. Putting it like that makes it sound stupid and cliche but I actually found it to be a pretty OK story for the most part with a twist I didn't really see coming. Only problem with it was that it felt a bit too black and white with Salamandra. With the Order of the Flaming Rose and Scoia'tael on the other hand it was a lot harder to decide (though to be fair I though the Flaming Rose and Eternal Fire in general were just too fanatical). Even then, decided to remain neutral as best I could.

Voice acting, not the best. Fighting, works but I can see the complaints. I probably only ever used Aard or Igni in my playthrough. Themes of fantasy though, that was interesting. I liked the whole sub-plot with the Vodyanoi and the Lovecraftian inspired Dagon. Though, I did take issue with other things, like not really interacting with Foltest, how toxicity didn't drain unless you found a campfire and meditated, and the overall pacing of the game. Still, it was interesting to play through none the less and set the basis of many references that I would recall later on in the other two games. Not an essential game to play or even the best in terms of engine/quality in general, but still a nice play.

**WITCHER 2**

Second game that immediately shows improvement in technical terms but almost suffers in terms of story. After some in-story time, you are working for Foltest, but he dies to another witcher, leaving you framed. Now it's up to you to clear your name while going down two possible paths and bring the kingslayer to justice, while inadvertently discovering another secret altogether (the lodge of sorceress for those who couldn't guess).

Already this is a technical improvement from the first game from its look and how it plays, which overall I enjoyed but also seemed to suffer in other aspects. First, it went from this flip on fantasy tales, mainly from Polish fokelore (as I understand) to a more political stance and story view. Nothing wrong with that but I just wasn't invested as I was with the first game. The game also felt shorter with how it only had three chapters + epilogue compared to the previous game's 5 chapters + ep. Through my initial play though, I ended up siding with Iorveth simply because I felt more pity towards them in the previous game and I wanted to see what his path was like. Needless to say in chapter two when I found out Saskia was a dragon, I was happy with the choice I made. Might play through it again on Roche's path to see how things are different (and see if Hensalt isn't a full piece of shit or not). Also, Letho. God DAMN is Letho a cool dude. I only ever killed him once just to get the achievement before reloading and sparing him because his story is very similar to yours in some way. Getting captured and being forced to help a faction that you don't really have any affiliations to. Only main difference is that your more the aggressor to Letho afterwards to try and clear your name.  Also, Letho just is cool.

Radovid and Foltest might have been the weakest part of this though. I only ever saw Foltest like three times in the last game, meet twice overall so I didn't really feel a connection when he died. And Radovid doesn't really show up until the end and just ends up becoming this unlikable asshole by the end of it all since I didn't choose the default option and spare Triss who would of prevented the purge an Loc Muinne. 

I also found the combat in this to be a bit more annoying/frustrating. First time I tried playing on Normal since the first game I played on easy and wanted to test my skill. Got up to the Endrega contract and SO many times I wanted to break my controller. Tried switching to easy and actually got ganged up on by so many warriors/drones that I was just on the ground getting repeatly hit for what felt like 10 minutes (was probably like a minute or half that) but then died again and set me back to normal difficulty and JUST FUCK! 

Combat. in general. was. frustrating! I hated the whole notion of having backstab damage to you. It felt unfair considering how many enemies you might be facing at a time. True you could use it against enemies as well, but I felt that rarely opened up to me during my playthrough, so it felt onesided. Traps were horrid, the leveling tree felt like meh considering you only ever finish one path (alchemy just felt useless) and overall felt more like a prototype of what CDPR wanted to do. It did make me use more than Aard and Igni from the first game, which I did think was an improvement.

I do want to continue on about this but I'd just be writing all night, so I'll wrap it up a bit. I like the idea of different paths, I like the attempt of new combat but found it frustrating, the story was OK but not great, and I feel it's more like the black sheep of the three games. Not terrible, but not my favorite.

**WITCHER 3**

GOD DAMN WAS IT GOOD WHEN I FINALLY GOT TO THIS GAME!!! Nearly every issue I had with the first two games were fixed in this one. Got back to its roots on a twist on fairytales and fantasy stories, is more refined from the second game in terms of combat and mechanics, removal of the near useless traps, and any more issues I could try and list (but I won't since that would drag this on and I can't remember them all right now). In addition, it made some changes that I absolutely loved: addition of fast travel throughout this whole open world now, potion usage in combat was added in, unique armor sets (I love the bear personally due to my playstyle).

Not to mention the quests and story. Overall, they're great. Lots of variation in quests with interesting monsters to fight, like the first time I hunted a chort, thinking it was a fiend, or getting lured to a trap by monsters and either deciding to kill them or reason with them that I only kill those that threaten the balance between both worlds living together. And the story itself was amazing. Finally getting your memory back, finding Yennifer and Ciri, fighting the Wild Hunt, the impact from your decisions, all of it just felt great. 

HOWEVER, I did take some issues with the writing in some cases. As an example, the tavern owner you save from having her head caved in the beginning calls you out later in Novigrad when meeting Priscilla as a ""murderer of Temarians"" even though they were beating the shit out of her. Or how one monster contract leads to the employer dead, with nothing you say or do to keep him alive, in order to chain to three new quests. Inventive, but that lack of feeling that I can do anything to prevent it (outside of advancing a subplot to not trigger that, which is dumb) gives me the feeling of helplessness to force me down this path, rather than letting me find it or fail in my goal and then leading me down it. That kind of design I hate and were some of the moments that did kind of make the game feel less amazing.

Still, there is a lot of other stuff that's just fun. Lots of rememberable characters and moments, an absolutely lovely soundtrack, funny jabs at certain cliches or stories (even one at the initial trailer for the game), a few references that I caught from my past games which made it feel rewarding to play through those, and just a lot to explore. Oh and gwent. FUCK YEAH GWENT! I absolutely love this game mode and can see why it was later expanded onto its own thing. Kind of got annoying later on, especially during High Stakes when the first two decks you play against are heavy on spies and you have to know how to play against it.

Only other issues I had were that while it is open world, it almost felt at times it didn't want you to explore certain areas until you were properly leveled or if you were really skilled enough. More of a peeve though. I also felt like the pacing was a bit off, though that might just have been me running around all of Velen for the first 20+ hours trying to discover everything I could and the Wild Hunt didn't really feel that intimidating. I mean, they only show up around what I can say is the middle-end of the second act and then you kind of just kill them off all by the end. You don't really have that much of a connection to them outside of the seige of Kaer Morhen, unlike say Letho in the Prologue and CH1 of W2 or even the Professor and Azir in W1 where you meet them multiple times. Granted though, I actually did feel more emotion to Vesemir's death than Foltest, simply because you did get to know him a lot more throughout the game. And that's not even going into the DLC this game had...

**HEARTS OF STONE**

Yup! I'm reviewing the DLC separately. Overall, a short but very well done DLC. You get more areas to explore, a new kind of upgrade system, new interesting quests like a vault break in, and very memorable characters. Got to see the lovely Shani again, along with getting a hilarious one night stand sequence after a quest to entertain a ghost, Olgierd was a very grey character of sorts, doing horrible things in the past but also getting to know him to feel how he's regretted these actions, and Gaunter O'Dimm. Fucking. Hell. This guy is scary. You don't even know what he's suppose to be, he even tells you that you don't want to know. The closest you get to what describes him is that he's evil incarnate. And that's pretty damn accurate! Kind of took some issue with the boss fights in this though. Frog boss was kind of easy to figure out with the poison but not so much for tactics, the one Jafar mage looking dude was kind of dumb to fight (even though it was optional), Olgierd I didn't really know what I could parry or dodge, every boss in this just felt like a mystery to fight for the first time and not something that I could figure out while fighting them. Regardless, it's a nice and quick DLC to play through.

**BLOOD AND WINE**

And last, the expansion I have just finished quite recently. Honestly, this was overall better than Hearts of Stone. A whole brand new area to actually explore, far more unique quests to take part in, a gripping story about murders and ultimately deciding who is the true monster. Seriously, I thought every part of the main story of this was fantastic. The Duchess is a fairly sincere but stern and sometimes stubborn character, I like how the guard captain wasn't fully biased against you the whole time, I like the addition of Regis coming back and just this whole vampire theme overall. A lot of it just feels like, if they wanted, a whole new game on it's own or even a short story that could fit right in with all the others. 

I actually felt sorry for Dettlaff in the end and with my decisions since he was, in the end, manipulated. That's not saying sending a vampire army against the city was still the right call but the Duchess also should of taken the demand a bit more seriously as to what would happen. And of course there is some pity for the Syanna considering her backstory and motives but in the end, if you just plain don't like her or made the same decisions I made, she is essentially the true monster...and unfortunately got what she wanted even with her death shortly after. It's a very sad, end to the story with everyone dying but it almost feels appropriate considering how the Witcher handles these kind of tales. 

Still haven't done everything in the DLC either though, at most I just finished up the gwent side of things (because...gwent). Might go back and do some of the other quests. I think there's one about a girl who's also a bird? Don't spoil the whole thing for me, I've only heard bits of that quest.

**OVERALL**

I really love this series so far. I like how it's getting more and more attention and more variations of formats, from books to video games and now a streaming series. It's a fascinating world that's a unique blend of Game of Thrones style and feel but more of a breakdown of various fables and fairytales. Though it is a shame that the original author doesn't love the games bringing the series more fame (I don't know how popular the books were back then), because I really think the games helped expand it to what it is now than if it was just kept to books. Either way, I can't wait for more, be it the second season on Netflix or the possible Witcher 4. I'm happy I gave the series another try and plan to stick with it (Might take a break from plaything 3 though since I've played through it once. Have other things I want to do/try).",2,1585370885,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fqdkws/a_review_on_my_experience_with_the_witcher_series/,witcher,1

This is a very nice large scale [**map**](https://i.redd.it/s0ckga605vd31.jpg) I found. Is this based on original? Can somebody explain what all those different places are about?

I know that Ciri is the princess of Cintra. She is also a Source born with powerful magic as well as a trained Witcher? 

I think Nilfgard conquered Cintra when Ciri was younger, but I can't tell the span of that kingom. On the map, it's way at the bottom.

And also, there's Redania, Temeria, Kaedwen, Aidirn that are in sort of conflict with eachother, but are under threat of Nilfgard?

Also, what is the inspiration of these stories? Even Dragon Age has a similar lore where a special order goes through rigorous training. Then has to drink a lethal concoction to mutate into a Warden if they survive. As well as elves being like refugees.

fq4c30,huntbob27,Nilfgaard is NOT the bad guy.,"In my personal opinion, I kind of like Nilfgaard. I can sort of understand why the North fears/detests Nilfgaard because like yeah they‚Äôre super expansionist. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make them evil. I mean of course if I‚Äôm a Nordling and some Nilfgaardian talked down to me I‚Äôd be like offended &amp; etc but can you really blame them? The nordling people are very barbaric and I just see racism and rape everywhere. It‚Äôs dark. 
After really thinking about how Nilfgaard runs their government/society, they would bring much needed order to the Northern Realms. If they annexed Temeria/Redania/Kaedwen etc. life probably wouldn‚Äôt change much for the average peasant. I think structure would help. It appears as though Nilfgaard is somewhat ahead in terms of technological advancement, too. I think Blood and Wine was a good example of Nilfgaard. It was the first time I‚Äôd seen it cast in a positive light. Toussaint is filled with a bunch of regular people, just like anywhere else. I think the Nordlings could stand to be a little more open minded. Nilfgaardians aren‚Äôt much different from them. 

TL;DR: Emhyr Var Emeris is a fucking powerhouse and Nilfgaard is good for the North because they would bring order and prosperity. Nilfgaard isn‚Äôt necessarily bad.",16,1585338997,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fq4c30/nilfgaard_is_not_the_bad_guy/,witcher,2

fpymc9,Very_bad_mom,Apropos of Nothing - Dream with Henry Cavill and an Aard gun.,"I had a dream last night that I was madly in love with Henry Cavill but he married a girl from my high school (Regina Allen)  in a secret wedding.  I wasn't invited to the wedding , which was very sad , because I thought my mad love for Henry was secret.  Apparently he knew!   

From the photos in my dream, the wedding was beautiful with tons of Dog Wood blossoms filtering through the air and DogWood twigs with nascent flowers ready to pop.  For those of you who don't know what DogWood is, it's a  spring flowering tree that has creamy white blossoms but these were also tinged with pink. 

In my dream, Regina had already been married 4 times ( not true in real life) and she was only 22.  Obviously, Regina was not the person for him!  

Anyway, Henry got really mad and me and decided to kill me with an Aard gun.   So the rest of the dream was running away and trying to stay alive. He was relentless and did not give up easily. 

The Aard gun in my dream could chop people in half, like in the Witcher game ( I'm a level 55).   BTW, when I use Aard in the game, this makes me laugh giddily every time I do it.  ""Come on Bandits, get over here! "" 

In the end, Henry never realized I was the only woman for him and he stuck with that slut Regina.  Better luck next time, Henry.",2,1585322102,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fpymc9/apropos_of_nothing_dream_with_henry_cavill_and_an/,witcher,2

fpsa97,theloneshewolf,Just beat the first Witcher game...,"...And I had a couple of unanswered questions, particularly about the ending. Idk if the next game will answer them or not, but I was hoping you guys could shed some light on a few things for me. If you could, I'd greatly appreciate it! Here goes:

1. When Geralt is making his way through the streets of Vizima to face off against the Grand Master, a refugee leads him into a secret hideaway. While there, I tried talking to Yaevinn (I sided with the Scoia'tel) and all he says is that we have to hurry but afterwards Geralt makes an ominous comment about how ""this place has a strange effect on me"". The game never goes any further than that though. Was this some kind of plot point that got dropped in development? What does he mean ""this place has a strange effect on me""? What kind of effect?
2. Speaking of that hideout, somehow both the Hermit and the Resolute Girl from Murky Waters are there. Why though? Vizima is in flames, wouldn't it be safer for them to remain in Murky Waters? What are they doing in that safehouse?
3. What ever happened to Alvin. He disappeared during the fight between Toruviel and the Order of the Flaming Rose, and it is never stated what happened to him after that. The game seems to hint that the Grand Master, Jacques de Aldersberg, is really an older Alvin that somehow traveled back in time from the future, but if so that raises a ton of other questions! Where did Alvin teleport to? Why didn't he teleport back? What happened to make him so cynical and caused him to go crazy? I get he had visions of the White Frost or whatever but is that really enough to drive a person insane? And why does he seem to hold a grudge against Geralt? Geralt was the one who saved Alvin's life and took him in, why would Alvin hate him? Moreover, why did he change his name? And if Jacques is Alvin from the future after he accidentally teleported away from the aforementioned fighting, then how the fuck does that work because Alvin teleported away because the Order of the Flaming Rose attacked the elves in Murky Waters. If Jacques is the leader of the Order, that means he must've been the one to give the command to attack Toruviel. But why would he do that if he knew that would cause his younger self to teleport away, thus becoming Jacques? And what about before Alvin teleported away and became Jacques during the fighting? If the fighting is what caused Alvin to teleport and become Jacques, but Jacques is the one who ordered the Order to attack the elves, then wouldn't the two cancel each other out because without Jacques giving the order to attack the elves, Alvin wouldn't have teleported away and wouldn't have become Jacques, meaning Jacques wouldn't have gone back in time to give the order to attack the elves causing Alvin to- DEAR GOD I HATE TIME TRAVEL.
4. And lastly, since the game hinted that Jacques was Alvin because he was wearing a dimetrium amulet and Geralt and Dandelion acknowledged this, why was Geralt so calm when mentioning this to Dandelion? You'd think he'd be more distraught, having just found out that the madman responsible for so much carnage and whom he just stabbed with a sword was Alvin from the future!

fpqz9s,Dean_AW,I haven't played blood and wine yet,"Let me give you ladies and gents some backstory:
In 2015 I was 16 years old and my mother had hated video games since forever so I always had at max 4-5 games per console generation, of which I only had two, a Wii and an Xbox one. Around the summer season my family decided to renovate our backyard by turning in to a small vineyard (ironic :) ) there was a task of removing every single rock and pebble from the ground to make room for clean dirt, my parents wanted to pay someone a crapton to do it but I volunteered in the condition that they let me get a full priced game. They agreed and it took me about a week but I finally got it done (it was horrible, there were hundreds of thousands of tiny ones.) 
Anyway I was thinking about what game to buy, I don't get alot so I had to make it count, I watched some YouTube videos and they all pointed towards this game series I've never heard of before called The Witcher. It was mostly Angry Joe that got me to finalize my decision, I was so excited after watching his review. So I grabbed the game and started playing it, needless to say I've never played anything like it before in my life, I'd even to say that it made me the person I am today. 

This is a side but I had this tradition of watching kitchen nightmare on my phone while crafting witcher armor because collecting nekker hearts was a bit of a grind, fun grind.

So I finished the game just in time for heart's of stone, (I found it better than the base game even.) Now I did everything the game had to offer (at least I thought) but I still wanted more so I went on Amazon and got the entire book series, read it, got witcher 1, 9/10, got witcher 2, 8/10, then I went ahead and started 3 again. I found about 7 new missions I've never played before and since then I've done multiple trilogy playthroughs with different outcomes and always a consistent amount of missions I just flat out missed, but I've had blood and wine on my account for so long and I'm too scared to open it.

I know that this is the end, I know that Geralt breaks the fourth wall in the end but I refuse to get there, I feel like once I do my Journey will be over and the games will never be the same again.

I'm currently doing the Kira Metz missions on PC with a ton of immersion and graphics mods and I'm feeling that in this playthrough I'll finally do it, but the question is, should I?

In all of your honest opinions, will this DLC leave me wanting for more? Or will it be enough to ""hand up the swords"" so to speak...

I can't help but be scared of going to Toussaint...

When Kira arrives at Kaer Morhen, Geralt asks her if she is putting on make up for the Wild Hunt. She replies with, ""Women only ever beautify themselves for their own satisfaction.""

In *Blood of the Elves,* when Triss is putting on make up for herself and Ciri, she says, ""A woman accentuates her beauty for her own self-esteem.""

Another one is Ciri's conversation with Ceon about the best fencer where Ceon famously mentions that the best fencers are in cemeteries.

My skill tree is full, and I‚Äôm wondering if you guys can offer some advice on which skills to drop and which to add.

I‚Äôm level 38, I wear master-crafted feline armor, and I‚Äôm currently playing Hearts of Stone. For signs, I primarily use Quen in battle (I use other signs when appropriate, especially Yrden).

I‚Äôve got all the following skills maxed and active: all fast attack skills (muscle memory, precise blows, whirl, crippling strokes), the first three strong attack skills (strength training, crushing blows, rend), the first two battle trance skills (resolve, undying), exploding shield (I use Quen a lot, but I‚Äôm not so interested in active shield), acquired tolerance, and cat school techniques. 

I think I should invest some points in sunder armor, but I‚Äôm not sure what to get rid of. I‚Äôd also potentially like Quen intensity and Quen discharge. I use potions a lot, so Acquired Tolerance has been helpful to me, but I otherwise haven‚Äôt invested in alchemy skills.

I haven't picked up the game since mid 2016, so let's say it has been a long time and I've surely forgotten how to play in general. Of course I can search and then remember which buttons do what but I'm sure the gameplay in general will be at least clunky in the beginning.

But regarding my question: I completed the game with a physical copy borrowed form a friend in 2016 but bought the complete edition some months ago, and for the reasons I wrote before I haven't touched the game since. Do you think my save file should be fine and more importantly if it is how should I approach the game? Should I start over and erase everything? Restart with NG+? Or straight with the DLC's?

Thanks in advance for the answers and have a nice day! Also fuck portals.",4,1585244947,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fpg1lj/how_should_i_approach_the_return_to_the_game/,witcher,1

This game is gorgeous and I honestly adore the story and characters so far. However the combat is ruining it all for me.
It is rare that I enjoy talking to characters more than boss fights in any game..

Now I am very early in the game (I killed Nithral yesterday).

I feel like my damage is pretty bad compared to what I'm being presented with. I now found the Wyvern in Johnnys Quest and I can't beat it.

Now that I've completed the story and don't have the DLC's yet, I'm more or less playing the game to get the most powerful/dope gear I can find.  I recently just came across a steel sword that was slightly higher in damage than my current one but, as I have before, I am wondering if the damage reigns supreme when it comes to evaluating which sword to choose.  Here are the two swords I'm considering...

&amp;#x200B;

Elven Steel Sword:  First of all, this sword looks dope af so I'm very hesitant to let it go.  

Damage: 256-314 ; +3 igni ; +3 queen ; +10 critical hit chance ; 2 runestone slots

Faroe Blade: 

Damage: 267-327 ; +36 armor piercing ; +75 critical hit ; +4 critical hit chance ; 1 runestone slot

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly new to reddit altogether, let alone Witcher, so if I've said anything stupid or wrong, please let me know.  Also since I'm finished with the story,  any tips on very high level gear besides master crafted , or any tips on cool/fun things to do would be greatly appreciated.",3,1585186663,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fp2rz0/elven_steel_sword_vs_faroe_blade_tips_for_post/,witcher,1

fp2hw3,alliethegreat008,This may be a dumb question,"So I've always wondered something, and this may be a dumb question, but how is it that silver burns Adda (the striga in the first chapter) but not Nivellen (the beast from A Grain of Truth). They are both monsters cursed by magic, so why would silver effect one, but not the other? 

""As he leapt away he dealt a hard blow to the side of her head with the silver spikes studding the knuckles of his gauntlet. The striga roared horribly, filling the palace with a booming echo, fell to the ground, froze and started to howl Holloway and furiously. The Witcher smiled maliciously. His first attempt, as he had hoped, had gone well. Silver was fatal to the striga, as it was for most monsters brought into existence through magic.""

""You're not a monster. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to touch this silver tray. And in no way could you hold my medallion.""

Maybe I'm missing something? Or maybe I'm looking too much into this? I'm not sure.

fp08hc,Erculosan,Items or Abilities Similar to Piercing Cold,"I have recently come back to playing Witcher 3 in this quarantine. I created an NG+ file about a year ago and have been playing where I left off. I am currently level 70 and I am looking for abilities like Piercing Cold or items like the Grandmaster Griffin Armor that changes essentially in some way the signs. 

Piercing Cold gives Aard the ability to instantly kill any enemy that is knocked out and it also adds a crazy cool freezing effect. 

The Grandmaster Griffin Armor increases the size for Yrden by 40%, sadly I am too low level for that since right now I can just get the first edition of the witcher gears.

I am looking for items or abilities that would do things like this. Personally I enjoy making a build around this where I am able to have more fun instead of creating an OP build where I just immediately kill everyone and drink tons of potions.

I took my chances and got both, and I could not believe how well my money was spent. The details, the storytelling, the lore, all of it was an absolute masterpiece as the vanilla game was.

Maybe as an inclusion in a side quest somewhere, but his story is literally done. I loved all the references to the books and to finally see Regis in game was awesome. Even the final fight with Detlaff was extremely satisfying. I still have some side quests to finish and a few more areas to explore, so I do have a few more things to do, but I couldn't help but sit back and say, ""wow,"" after all of that. I still liked the Hearts of Stone story more than Blood and Wine, but Blood and Wine was much more of a satisfying ending than Hearts of Stone was. I really liked the mutations as well.

fosks5,Tsunasseater,Is Nilfgaard based on Hungary under King Matthias,"I just read the first book and started the second, nearly at the end of the Witcher 3, and watched the netflix show, and picked up some ressembelnce between Nilfgard and Hungary under king Mathias.
The first and big thing was the Black Army Both Emiry and Mathias had a Black Army and Mathiases army was the second bigest in europe and the third in the world 
And there is Emiry himself who in the game looks just like how king Mathias lives in the publick contusnes.
Emirys Italian/Spanis court is not a problem becouse Mathias had an Italian renecance court thanks to his wife.
Mathias was a big concerer taking Wiena the whole Check kingdom and half of Polland so this might as well be conection between him and the polish origines of this word.
I'm not realy sure becouse the Nilfgardian language is realy similar to german but on the other hand nearly all of Mathiases Generals and captians were italian or german he only had one Hungarian General, and in the court they spoke latin and german soo i dont know.

Basically, what's up with Ciri? I know, she's in Camelot telling Sir Galahad her story and killing whatever monsters there were in Arthurian myths for a dime. But I wonder, what's with the Chosen One thing? No Ithlinne Prophecy? The lodge is left out without two members, daddy Emhyr never gets a rightful heir and the Wild Hunt is still looking for her? I'm one of those who believe that the games are unnecessary for enjoying the books, and the other way around, but I have the feeling that this plot was anticlimactic at best.

fon01l,kjfofjg,"New to the whole series, got a few questions","So I picked up Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on the sale that's currently going on (PS4), since it was only like 9‚Ç¨. I read online that it's possible to just play it as your first Witcher game, some even recommended to do so, but I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of things. The lore seems to be quite deep, and I some of the time don't have any clue as to what the hell is going on. If there's a 'what you need to know before playing witcher 3' video/article that you would recommend, I'd appreciate it. I'd look for myself but I've gotten so much shit spoiled to me on other games, because people just can't keep it in their pants.

Other thing that's bothering me a bit in the game, is the alchemy system. Only time I've used anything from there, is when I smoked out this big ass rooster thing from its cave for a sidequest. So did you just learn to use the alchemy stuff as you progressed, or is there even something else of value other than bombs/potions? I'm more a fan of the A in ARPG rather than the RPG elements. I much prefer combat and gameplay over farming, crafting, min-maxing etc. Prefer it when the emphasis is on combat skill rather than what kind of equipment you have on. So maybe my question is, that do I need to learn or use the alchemy stuff at all? Crafting I've kinda gotten used to by now, although I just often sell my alchemy stuff and buy the crafting materials I need.",7,1585126174,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fon01l/new_to_the_whole_series_got_a_few_questions/,witcher,1

However, you will probably not be surprised to hear that my current schedule is not my normal schedule, and since I am stuck at home I was considering getting it on Steam to start with and then getting it on Switch as well once I go back to work, since I see that the Switch version supports cloud saves with Steam.   

My only concern is the graphics. I know the Switch version has some downscaled stuff, and while I am not worried about that bothering me if I only play the Switch version, I am worried that if I try to go back and forth I will end up only playing it on PC.

foagaf,Deathswitch,Thoughts on The Witcher: Enhanced Edition,"Hi,

So right now I have plenty of time due to the current pandemic, so I figured I'd do a write up on the first game. Heads up, I played on easy with slightly liberal use of a guide because I wanted to get through it quickly; I have two more games to go. I clocked in about 43 hours and I did as many quests as I could. I'm sure I missed a lot. So I'm going to write this up in several categories with a closing statement at the end. 

Graphics: In today's standards, they don't hold up for the most part. Character models are extremely outdated and somewhat creepy, even for 2007 (Mass Effect holds up as an example). The best part was the environments, especially in chapter four.  Once you get used to it though, it's not that bad overall. I loved the UI. Clean and easy to use, I had no problem navigating through it and it really holds up. I like it better than The Witcher II's.

Sound/music: Great effects and atmosphere, it really engrossed me into this world and I have zero complaints. It's definitely ahead of it's time and I would have absolutely been blown away if I played it when it first came out. The voice acting is mediocre at best, it has it's moments though. I liked Geralt's VA a lot (English dub).

Gameplay: Plainly put, it's awkward at first but when you get used to it, it has it's charm. Sword play is a rhythm game with a variety of spells (signs) that have different effects depending on what kind of enemy you're facing. Strong, quick, and group. Silver for monsters, steel for humans. Preparing for fights and situations with alchemy really adds to the immersion. Swallow, Tawny Owl, and Cat were the most common potions that I used for easy mode but I can definitely understand the usefulness of other potions and blade coatings in higher difficulties. If you want to cheese it though, put all your points in Igni but it somewhat breaks the game (at least on easy). I skipped the dice mini game.

Story: (Spoilers) &gt;!Excellent. Overall, it really sucks you in. The main quest can be hit or miss at times but the side quests really made me feel like a Witcher (toss a coin, if you will). The investigation bits in chapter two and three were a slog at times because of the amount of backtracking. Some parts weren't very clear and you could mess up the ending if you weren't careful. Exploring had it's merits too, sometimes I would run into NPCs like the Con Artist by the sewers in Vizima that I would've missed if I didn't check to see him at dawn. !&lt;

(Spoilers continued) &gt;!Everything wasn't black and white, more like shades of grey. Even remaining neutral between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael had consequences. There was no right or wrong when it came to the factions. It was nice to be able to spare monsters based off your judgment calls as there were some that weren't truly evil (like the Werewolf). I tried to make decisions based on what Geralt would do but I definitely had to make my own decisions as well. The twist at the end was great, it wasn't hard to figure out though !&lt;(end spoilers).

Chapter Ratings:

Prologue: 3/5

Chapter I: 3/5

Chapter 2: 2/5

Chapter 3: 3/5

Chapter 4: 5/5

Chapter 5: 4/5

Epilogue: 4/5

Once you get past chapter three it gets so much better. I recommend taking breaks if you feel worn out here and there. If I didn't I would've definitely been burnt out between two and three.

tl;dr: Overall, this game is a gem. If you can get past it's faults it was truly a worthwhile experience and I'm glad that I played it! I give this game a 8/5, probably higher if I played it in the late 2000's. Don't expect it to be The Witcher II and III though, pretend it's a different game and set your expectations accordingly. If you're a fan of The Witcher, I say it's a must play. I probably won't go through it more than once though.

fo7uhu,Bernacusmax,Gwent standalones on mobile and consoles.,"So I signed up for the Gwent standalone game on my mobile a few days ago.  It released finally and just dipping my toes in the last hour or so.  
As I understand it, there is a Gwent standalone on console and PC as well.

So I'll ask if anyones playing it? 
How do you like it compared to the origional? 
What are your dislikes/critiques? 
Has anyone started on mobile yet? 
Or will you not play it for X reason because..? 

Just interested on a general consensus about these versions.  I absolutely love the Witcher 3 for the Gwent.

fo4n4m,Xelon99,Another post about the Overkill achievement,"I've been doing this for a couple hours now, but it still hasn't popped up. I'm at the Devils Pit, using Broadheads bolts, Devils Puffballs and Dancing Stars. I lead some enemies (1 to 3, depending on who are close enough to aggro on me and follow) to the opening gate where there's an invisible wall. I lock on to one person, shoot a broadhead into them and manually switch to the other persons there to make sure they're all bleeding. After that I toss a puffball, switch to the Dancing Stars while the puffball is still in the air and toss it at them immediately after. I do this twice (the enemies survive the first round of fire and poison, yet the bleeding effect stays) and meditate for an hour to get my items back. Then I rinse and repeat until the camp is clear. 

If it hasn't popped yet I'll reload my save to before I started the run and do it all over again. After 5 runs it still has not popped. I have even restarted the console a couple times already.

fo24or,NOOBSLAYER2179,Thoughts on the books? I have mixed feelings,"Here's my thoughts so far (note: I've never played the games)

The short stories were fun to read and I found them exciting. I felt like I got to see Geralt's personality well and also get some good action and interesting plot.

The main series? I'm getting a bit bored with it (halfway through baptism of fire). It seems like each book is doing very little to forward the plot and world building is fairly shallow in the main series. The English translation at least is not great which might affect my enjoyment.  

I would argue the book isn't always doing that much to forward the character exploration either. There is a lot of time spent on random details that don't really make a difference to the story, the characters, or the world. 

3 books into the main series and there doesn't seem to be a clear reason as to why Ciri is so important, why Geralt is required to protect her etc. I mean, the books do kind of discuss that she is important, that she has special abilities, and the prophecy etc etc but not a lot of reasons why this matters. It makes it hard to be invested waiting for any relevant details after 4 books

Other issues:

1. Half the fight scenes are like ""geralt/Ciri spun and did a pirouette"" over and over again

2. Every name gives birth to another 20 names so there is a lot of breadth but little depth‚Äîit just seems deep and thought out because you have no idea who the fuck is involved since Sapkowskie keeps dropping names nonstop without giving deeper exploration. It's like when the Iliad spends an entire chapter dropping names‚Äîno one will remember and no one cares 


Now there are a lot of good things about the book too. I do like some of the characters and appreciate the time spent on them. It's well written and very believable.

However, while trying hard to love the series, I think it's maybe a little overrated and mostly popular because people like the games/show. 

That being said, I am going to finish the series out and hopefully my opinion changes!

 P.S. I love literature and read a lot of slow paced books, my problems with the books aren't just that I want it to be like a video game. This isn't a comprehensive discussion on my opinions, just a few.

fo1nw0,ImSuperCereus,"Was the Secondary Relic Weapon, Poker, Downgraded?","Playing Witcher 3 on the Switch. I looted my Poker weapon from the creepy reverend guy in Carnal Sins, notably by talking to him and getting the info of the real killer out of him, but still killing him for torturing maidens afterwards. And I love the design on this weapon, the way it lights up when I draw it for battle, and I plan to keep using it even though it's weaker than swords I already have and will be drastically weaker than ones by the end game (I rely on signs anyway), but I still wanted the strongest possible variant of this weapon. I looked it up and it says I should the Relic version of this item, but I only have it listed as a Common version and indeed the icon of it isn't glowing orange or anything on the inventory screen. 

Did one of the updates for this game actually remove the Relic version of this item or change how players could get it? Is it still possible to acquire a stronger version of this item on the Switch, a console where I can't use mods or commands. If I can still somehow get the Master or Relic variants on the Switch, could anyone direct me to where and how I get them? Or if there are any cooler looking secondary weapons I'd be up for hearing about those.

fo186z,FakeRealMemes,I can‚Äôt stand all of the praise this mediocre show is getting,"First of all, let me say that I‚Äôve finished all the books and have played the 3rd game. The casting of this show misses the mark completely. It feels like they choose people because they were attractive. Now to talk about Cahills Geralt.

He‚Äôs been getting so much praise. For what? He says fuck and hmm and y‚Äôall go crazy. Now the writing might be a problem but he acts more like Batman than Geralt of Rivia as portrayed in the books. Ciri was cast way too old for there to have a proper father daughter relationship with Geralt. And Yennefer was cast decently.

The writing sucks. It does. How can they get away with cutting such important short stories like ‚ÄúSword of Destiny‚Äù in favour of Yennefer acting like a teen? The whole plot line with the Doppler and Dara could have been cut and replaced with Geralt. Then we could actually explore why Geralt and Jaskier are such close friends. As a book fan, how in the fuck did Vilgefortz the most powerful mage at this time in the story, lose to Cahir? Is this some sort of joke? I could barely get through the ‚ÄúGirl Power‚Äù Yennefer plotting. This isn‚Äôt the story of Yennefer. Lauren needs to fired.

Right now im doing H/S and just got the painting ""Starry night over the Pontar"", very classy. Well i begrudgingly went to the wiki for advice and it said you can sell it to the guy for that horse trophy AND put it in the house. Heres the problem, it said the cutoff point for selling the painting is my next main quest. So my question is would i have to drop everything, plough through B/W,  and unlock the house just to hand that painting there and be able to sell it?

fnrx6d,theloneshewolf,Why didn't anyone tell Geralt about Yennefer?,"Apologies if this has been asked before, but I was wondering if anyone had any theories as to why none of Geralt's friends told him about his past relationship with Yennefer? Zoltan, Dandelion, Vesemir, any of them could've at least mentioned her! I get Triss probably didn't because she wanted Geralt for herself and I don't think Shani knew that Geralt was in a serious relationship with Yennefer, but the rest...? No clue. On a side note, I realize Triss is pretty popular in the fandom but does anyone else think it was rather shitty of her to make moves on an amnesiac man who was clearly taken? I mean, that first sex scene with Triss back at Kaer Morhen actually made me kind of uncomfortable. Even before I knew about the existence of Yennefer, it felt wrong somehow for a woman to take advantage of a man with amnesia. Even if Geralt was willing, does it really count as full consent if he doesn't really have his full memory? Couldn't that be considered borderline rape?

Others may disagree, but to me the whole scene felt kind of like Triss was manipulating Geralt to believe that the two of them used to be in a relationship together. I mean I guess technically speaking they kind of were? But it was more of a fling than a true monogamous relationship like Geralt's and Yennefer's was. Furthermore, I'm surprised no one mentioned Geralt's adoptive daughter, Ciri, either. The closest the game got to referencing either Yennefer or Ciri, I think, was when the innkeeper in Act IV tells Geralt the story of a witcher at Kaer Morhen who was in a relationship with a sorceress, with whom he adopted a daughter. Anyway, just wanted to know what you guys think! Why do you believe no one told Geralt about Yennefer or Ciri? And do you think it was wrong of Triss to manipulate/pursue a relationship with Geralt while he had amnesia?",35,1584997455,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fnrx6d/why_didnt_anyone_tell_geralt_about_yennefer/,witcher,1

fnqyjn,Kamamura_CZ,Noonwraiths,"There were many questions about the origin of the Slavic folklore that helped the authors to populate the populate the Witcher mythos, and I have realized that a 19th  century Czech poet Karel Jarom√≠r Erben wrote a book of poems called ""The bouquet"", a book I hated as a child because I had to memorize and recite the poems and school, but also a book I read today as an old guy with new respect and understanding (the dread emanating from some of the poems compares favorably with masters of the horror genre). And one of the poems is called ""The noonday witch"", which is none other than the ""noonwraith"" from the game - a terrible apparition that comes the very moment the bells strike noon and steals children from people. I am myself incapable of translating this literary gem, but today I have found out an English translation exists, one from Susan Reynolds, so I hope that for the sake of illustration of the best of Slavic translated into the highest form of the written word, I hope she won't mind me copying it here. All the credits go to her in any case.

# The Noonday Witch

**Karel Jarom√≠r Erben**  


*By the bench there stood an infant,*  
*Screaming, screaming, loud and wild;*  
*\`Can't you just be quiet an instant?*  
*Hush, you nasty gypsy-child!*  


*Now it's noon, or just about,*  
*Daddy's coming home for dinner:*  
*while I cook, the fire's gone out---*  
*all your fault, you little sinner!*  


*Hush! Your cart's here, your hussar---*  
*look, your cockerel!---Go on, play!'*  
*Crash, bang! Soldier, cock and cart*  
*To the corner fly away.*  


*Once again that fearful bellow---*  
*\`May a hornet come and sting you!*  
*Hush, you naughty little fellow,*  
*Or the Noonday Witch I'll bring you!*  


*Come for him, you Noonday Witch, then!*  
*Come and take this pest for me!'---*  
*In the door into the kitchen,*  
*Someone softly turns the key.*  


*Little, brown-skinned, strange of feature,*  
*On her head a kerchief pinned;*  
*With a stick -- crook-legged creature,*  
*Voice that whistles like the wind!*  


*\`Give that child here!' \`Lord, forgive*  
*this sinner's sins, my Saviour dear!'*  
*It's a wonder she still lives,*  
*For see---the Noonday Witch is here!*  


*Silent as a shadow wreathes,*  
*The witch towards the table's slipping:*  
*Mother, fearful, scarcely breathes,*  
*In her lap the child she's gripping.*  


*Twisting round, she looks behind her---*  
*Poor, poor child---ah, what a fate!*  
*Closer creeps the witch to find her,*  
*Closer---now she's there---too late!.*  


*Now for him her hand is grasping---*  
*Tighter squeeze the mother's arms:*  
*\`For Christ's precious torments!' gasping,*  
*She sinks senseless with alarm.*  


*Listen---one, two, three and more:*  
*The noonday bell is ringing clear;*  
*The handle clicks, and as the door*  
*Flies wide open, father's here.*  


*Child clasped to her breast, he found,*  
*Lying in a faint, the mother;*  
*He could hardly bring her round,*  
*But the little one was -- smothered.*",4,1584994228,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fnqyjn/noonwraiths/,witcher,1

fnoixs,dr4kun,"Prestigious Polish music award for The Witcher 3. Original performers of many tracks completely omitted, CDPR's so-called composers as the sole laurates.","A very special MocArt of the decade for the Best Cinematic Theme of the Decade was awarded to Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz and Miko≈Çaj Stroi≈Ñski, the so-called composers of the music of The Witcher 3. 

Przyby≈Çowicz received the award in an event held at a studio instead of the usual full gala, due to the global pandemic. He thanked for the honour and said it represented 'years of hard work' of his and Stroi≈Ñski's. 

Neither Przyby≈Çowicz, nor RMF - the radio station presenting the award - mentioned the people who actually arranged and played a big chunk of the music arranged for The Witcher 3. The band, Percival Schuttenbach (named so after a character from the original Witcher books before the games even existed), was completely omitted in a bizarre short interview with Przyby≈Çowicz.

One might think that Przyby≈Çowicz and Stroi≈Ñski composed the score for The Witcher 3, and then hired a group of musicians to play it - as an architect would hire construction workers to realise his or her grand vision. Nothing could be farther from the truth, however. Everyone who ever played The Witcher 3 will instantly recognise just some of the following hits, to just name a few - in their original version:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cU4BoM5Tho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cU4BoM5Tho)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxVXhU-awTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxVXhU-awTs)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CczPsYFtJxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CczPsYFtJxs)

These all predate The Witcher 3.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm disappointed by such an attitude coming from Przyby≈Çowicz. Whatever the contract between CDPR/Przyby≈Çowicz and Percival, acting like it all was ""his and Stroi≈Ñski's years of hard work"", as he said during the short interview, is in terribly bad taste to put it lightly.

OS: Windows 10 64 bit

Processor: Intel core i7-8700 3.20GHz (12 CPUs)

Video card: GeForce GTX 960

Memory: 8GB RAM

Hi everyone,

so, around 3 weeks ago I stopped playing The Witcher 3 for about 10 days. Everything was running properly before I stopped, the game was running smoothly and nicely, using medium-high graphic settings.

I got back to playing after I stopped, and to my misfortune, suddenly everything was clunky, slow, so naturally the game felt more like a tedious chore than something I can enjoy. It's not that the FPS suddenly drops, it's mostly steady, the game is just laggy, kind of drunk in a way? It seems like it takes 0.5-1 seconds for the game to respond to my keyboard and mouse.

Anyway, I tried tweaking and playing with the video settings, even setting them to low, and it obviously helped a bit, but it's still nowhere close to how it was running before on much higher settings. I also tried rolling back to the Nvidia driver (version  442.50) that was installed when the game was working fine, to no avail. I think it'd be right to conclude that it has nothing to do with the graphic card then, but you guys would probably know better.

I have no idea what to do next. A world where I can't play this game is like a world where Trump can't use twitter (and I know what you're thinking. 'A better world'. Shut up).

Please send help. Thanks.",5,1584978214,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fnm2bw/the_witcher_3_is_suddenly_slow_please_help_a/,witcher,1

fnkn2t,Alexinhow,[SPOILERS] A few words about Hearts Of Stone.,"**SPOILER WARNING**
---------------------------------

You will find countless threads and reviews on the masterpiece that The Witcher and its DLCs are, but I felt like sharing my 2 cents on the first expansion of the game, Hearts Of Stone.

After completing Blood &amp; Wine and being left mesmerized by the beauty and detail of Toussaint, I went into the next and final DLC of my first playthrough without many expectations. I thought of it as a minor DLC, with less available playhours and no new maps, maybe with a good plotline and quests but nothing more.

So I start playing. Cool, a witcher contract by a weird lad, just like the other 200 one I have already completed. But then things goes south: you end up on a ship in death row because you actually killed a cursed prince. Great, let me guess, Geralt finds his way out, slains everybody and yada yada yada. Well actually, no. Who shows up? One of the first, irrelevant characters that you met on the path just a few hundreds of hours before: Gaunter O'Dimm. He saves your ass with the condition of repaying your debt, and to assure himself that you'll respect the pact, he leaves a mark on your face. Alright, feels pretty satanish, but I guess he's just a petty mage. Come on, just open the cell and let me chop everybody to pieces. But what does he do instead? He randomly breaks a spoon and he fucking disappears. Weird I guess, but you know, mages and their portals, pretty standard. I wonder if he's actually going to help me or if I just got a free tattoo.

And then, for the first time, happens something which in my restricted and limited knowledge of The Witcher lore makes me start doubting about his real identity. Because he throws a huge fucking storm at the ship. How? Mages aren't that powerful, even the best ones. Did he manage to capture a Djinn? I remember a legend about a sorcerer who moved a mountain by doing so. Or maybe he is a Djinn? 

After this point, Hearts Of Stones got me hooked to the screen. I instantly forget about all my other sidequests and contracts: I want to know who this ""Gaunter O'Dimm"" actually is. Fueled by curiosity I go forward through the quests, with the plotline managing to marvelously develop and outline the characters involved. All. Expect. One. O'Dimm himself. He's just weird. You don't get many encounters with him, but you can feel it in your bones: there's something about him which you aren't grasping. What does he want from Olgierd? How did he make him immortal? Did he actually make him immortal? He's always alone, appearing and disappearing out of thin air. He always feels out of place. The quests go on, you fulfill Olgierd's last wish and you meet O'Dimm at the pub. What comes next is possibly the most powerful cutscene of the game, **maybe** only second to Geralt finding Ciri. It's powerful because it was at this point that my curiosity for O'Dimm turned into fear. As soon as you walk in, a drunk interrupts him by inviting you for a drink. And O'Dimm is right there. He doesn't cast a spell. He doesn't tell him to fuck off. He claps his hands. And the time fucking stops. It's in this moment that you start to grasp the real extent of his power. He's no Eredin with its dark armor and sword, nor a blazingly fast vampire with claws. He looks like a regular men. Talks like a regular man. But his personality and behavior feels twisted in a horrible way. Kind of like Stephen King describes terror, you aren't scared because of what he can do, you are scared because **you don't know what he can do**, and the feel which runs through your spine screams that his nature, whatever the fuck he is, is actually horribly evil. Leaving the poor man who stopped you with a spoon in his eye is just another confirmation to your suspects. At this point, my thirst to discover more turned into just wanting to get rid of this fucked up character and of the mark which during every second of your playthrough reminds you of the pact you unknowingly signed. After tricking Olgierd with another beautifully crafted catch in the contract he signed, he takes his soul, leaving nothing but the charred skull of what once was the eternal Olgierd Von Everac. What follows perfectly resumes the character and the feeling that he gave me for the past 20 hours of gameplay. He just leaves. With little no to indication about his next intentions he removes the mark from Geralt's temple, before whistling his creepy-as-fuck theme while he walks away tossing Olgierd's skull in the air. And for what is possibly the first time in the game, you see a glimpse of fear in Geralt's cold look. Just like in yours.

CDPR made what I know possibly consider the greatest DLC plotline ever. I was left with so many questions, and the anwsers given by the professor's quest only managed to fuel more speculation about his true nature. So thanks CDPR, the experience and the emotions I felt throughout the game were nothing short of amazing. I can't wait to start my second playthrough.",28,1584972886,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fnkn2t/spoilers_a_few_words_about_hearts_of_stone/,witcher,1

fnhm0u,Eliczka,Just finished Blood and Wine. I felt so much for Detlaff.,"I couldn‚Äôt help myself. I feel like this is where the monster isn‚Äôt the real monster. I can only imagine how it felt for him when he thought he had someone that cared about him (not that easy I assume when you are a higher vampire) and that he came to have deep feelings for Syanna while she just used him to her advantage. Yes, I know he almost destroyed the city but this blame falls on Anna Henrietta as well. She didn‚Äôt care about her sister until the point where she thought she was connected to the murders and after reading the diary, she was often a cause that their parents treated Syanna the way they did (in addition to the curse of Black Sun) such as starting quarrels and then blaming it on Syanna. Coming to this, I felt for her as well and I even understand that after what she‚Äôs been through she wanted revenge but at the end, she was a cause of all this on her own choice. 
When it came to the decision, I knew I wanted Detlaff to live so I went with a choice to negotiate and get Syanna from the illusion. What I didn‚Äôt anticipate was the red ribbon which eventually led me to killing Detlaff (I killed him just for the challenge) but since I‚Äôve wanted him to live from the beginning I cowardly went back to the old save and omit the ribbon and let her die. 
I was suprised to find out that the end when both Anarietta and Syanna live is considered the ‚Äògood one‚Äô. I know what happened when you fight Detlaff right away because my bf had that ending but even with Detlaff dead it seems more righteous to me. One can say that I‚Äôm never satisfied but the ending didn‚Äôt seem fair to me, I just wish there was a way for Detlaff to live and for the two to pay for what they have done to Beauclair because as I feel it, it was their mutual fault (even though the cause is long in the past).

Thank you if you read until here. I just needed to get those feelings out after yesterdays play.",8,1584958524,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fnhm0u/just_finished_blood_and_wine_i_felt_so_much_for/,witcher,1

I've been interested in the games for a while but never really got around to playing them. Recently, I wanted to watch series but thought that if I was going to discover The Witcher's world and setting it might be more enjoyable do it through the books and perhaps the games first.

Now, I have started reading The Last Wish and am thoroughly enjoying it. It's been great and I'm exited to read the rest of the books, watch the series and play the games (at least the third). But in which order?? 

What I want to know is this: which books does the series spoil? Should I read all of them before watching the series or is the series only based on some of the books? Also, given that I would also like to play the games (al least the third), should I play them before or after watching the series? Can I play the games while reading the books or do the games contain spoilers? Do the games contain spoilers of all or only some particular books?

In short, in which order do you suggest I consume all the material of Sapkowski's world?",11,1584935777,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fndido/thoughts_on_the_order_of_the_booksgamesseries/,witcher,1

fn8jxh,Thisismyusername561,Was The Show Really That Good?,"So, I‚Äôm posting this after having time to digest the show and read more of the books.  Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong.  I absolutely love the Witcher and the world Sapowski has created.  I spent more time in TW3 than I have with any other game, and I‚Äôve been reading more because his books are so good.

But, as much as I wanted to love it, the show doesn‚Äôt measure up.  There are three main reasons why I personally think this:

1.  The Story Adaption:  I hate to say it, but lots of the adaption from book to show was bad if not downright horrible. Renfri‚Äôs story was way too oversimplified and convoluted in the show.  If I hadn‚Äôt read the book first, I believe I would have been very confused. There are multiple examples of oversimplification or just downright removal of vital plots in the show.

2.  The timeline. Unbelievable confusing.  And saying that they give hints to it through dialogue is not a good argument.  If times are ‚Äúhopped‚Äù like this, it needs to be clear to the viewer.

3. Geralt‚Äôs relationship with Ciri is too shallow.  In the books, Geralt‚Äôs first meeting with Ciri is so meaningful and really builds a good foundation for their relationship.  But, the show forgoes this to build up drama in finding her. Leaving out this groundwork that Sapowski put in really left their relationship very hallow.

When it‚Äôs all said and done though, The show has potential.  The last episode especially gave me hope.  I wish all the people working on it the best, and hope they are able to remedy these (and other) issues in the next seasons.",2,1584915872,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fn8jxh/was_the_show_really_that_good/,witcher,1

fn2t57,Seiko5SNK,"I got the ""bad ending"" of Blood and Wine after finishing it for the first time this morning","Just wanted to write my thoughts down. I really felt for Dettlaff the entire time. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to keep him alive because of his gentle nature plagued by his emotions and lack of understanding human nature. I wasn't aware that getting Syanna's ribbon would drastically change everything (damn girl used my Gwent addiction against me). The love that he had for Syanna was too deep, and I honestly find it hard to blame him for the murders, especially since the person he loved the most was at risk of being tortured to death as he understood it. I researched the alternative endings and honestly, Dettlaff killing Syanna seems to be the best one. She used him for evil knowing that wasn't in his nature but he'd do it for her safety, and that to me justifies her death, especially by his hands. I'd be more sympathetic and understanding towards her if she killed the knights herself, so that no manipulation would have been involved. But yeah, taking advantage of someone's devotion to you to carry out murders is a no-no for me. Dettlaff was too good for everyone in this story and seeing Regis heartbroken and having to leave as a result really made me feel terrible.

As for Syanna killing Anarietta, I don't think Anarietta deserved it, however it really made the ending extremely fascinating. That ending definitely shocked me in a great way. One could say that Anarietta brought about her own death by failing to understand Dettlaff and constantly demanding his death. Plus...she was pretty rude to Geralt. 

I loved this DLC just as much as Hearts of Stone, if not more. While HoS had an amazing story, BaW felt like a completely newer game, with Geralt being more humorous and sarcastic, and story/animation concepts that weren't seen before.

fmwwu3,Lior0527,The weird experience of watching what you just read,"So. My Witcher evolution was as following:

1. Playing The Witcher 3.
2. Towards the end of the story in the game, I started reading The Last Wish.
3. Finished reading The Last Wish and continue on to The Sword of Destiny.
4. Right after finishing the game, I started watching the series, while still reading The Sword of Destiny.
5. I finished the last story of The Sword of Desitny hours after watching the last episode of the series.

What happened to me was that I was reading the short stories of the first two books, and days and sometimes merely HOURS later, seeing them on the screen as the events unfold in the series.

Unfortunately, I really did not enjoy this experience. When all the information from the books is so fresh in your head, every tiny deviation from the plot totally ruins what you had in mind. Generally I'm totally not a reader, so being disappointed by movies/series that are based on books doesn't usually happen to be (as I just don't read). So this time it was just over the top.

**I'd be glad to know what do the book readers think about the series.** The main thing that bothered me is that the series is missing huge aspects of Geralt's personality - he seems to only be bored, angry or ambivalent, while in the books I find him a lot more proactive, vocal, and caring about what happens around him.",23,1584867293,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fmwwu3/the_weird_experience_of_watching_what_you_just/,witcher,1

Here are the details:
- the commentator was a man, who began with the first book and went through all the books and then the games
- he had a very comical way of explaining it, using semi strong language and an overall light hearted air
- in the background he was playing the Witcher 3, and would occasionally put pictures of google images on the screen
- the video was definitley close to if not over an hour long
-short phrases I remember are ""it's actually one of the funniest books ever written"", ""and of course dandelion messed it up""..... or something like that.

fmg8wb,aliam290,Chronology within Blood of Elves,"I'm having trouble ordering the events in this book. Here's what I got so far, questions marked with \[Q\]:

After Something More Geralt takes Ciri to KM, where they spend about 2-3 years. In this time Ciri thinks she's training to be a witcher, but she's mostly just learning how to fight, some history, monsters etc. In the last 6 months there Triss arrives and teaches Ciri Elder, and I guess some etiquette stuff. They then go to the Temple of Melitele (on the road there the whole adventure with the dwarves and Squirrels and Triss's sickness happens) I'm guessing this trip takes a few weeks \[Q1: weeks? months?\]? Ciri then starts her studies at the temple, writing to Geralt when she can. Some months \[Q2: how many?\] later Yennifer arrives and Ciri's magic lessons begin. Something like 6 months \[Q3: how many months?\] of magical lessons later, they leave the temple. 

Somewhere in those 2-3 years of training in KM, Dandelion has the altercation with Reince and Yennifer saves him \[Q4: any indication when this falls on the timeline? or are Geralt and Ciri actually near the oak and the music Ciri hears is Dandelion?\]. Yen gets some ""down time"" until she receives the ""dear friend"" letter from Geralt and goes to the Temple.

After dropping Ciri off at the Temple, Geralt somehow hears about Reince \[Q5: is it stated how he finds out? or when he starts the search?\], tries to track him unsuccessfully, and so enlists as the ferry guard in order to have Reince catch him. 6 passages later, the altercation on the ferry happens, and he goes to Oxenfurt. He's living in that attic \[Q6: how long has he been in town?\] until Dandelion sends word then shows up. They go to the charlatan's house, and with an amulet they ""summon"" Reince, who shows up with the 4 assassins. Geralt wins the fight, but Reince escapes, with Phillipa preventing him from going after him. 

Shortly before meeting Geralt, Dandelion meets with the spy council. A lot of that conversation flew over my head. \[Q7: they talk about Reince not falling for the same trap twice? one of these is the boat, whats the other? Q8: why are Temerian and others interested in capturing Reince?\]

At some point during these 2-3 years, the Kings &amp; Queen council happens \[Q9: When is this?\]. Sometime later, 3 wizards including Tess meet with Valque to ask what should be done about the Kings/Queen acting independently and inciting war \[Q10: how long after is this?\].

Shortly before the Geralt vs Reince fight, the emperor relieves the governor of Cintra, establishes another, orders someone to order Reince to kill Geralt, and gives one last chance to the black winged knight of Ciri's nightmares. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if some of this is covered in the book.

fmfeo4,Leogos,Difficulty,"Hey all, I‚Äôm new to the Witcher world and wild hunt sat on my shelf since release till Netflix series reminded me of it, so this is my first play through and is it just me or are the expansions, heart of stone and blood and wine, just way harder all of a sudden. I played through the first part without any major difficulty, sure I‚Äôd die a few time here and there but not like what‚Äôs going on in Toussaint. 
I played through on the hardest difficulty but now I‚Äôm considering lowering it, I finished the game at level 35, going through if there was a quest 3 levels above my current level it was just hard,  now 1 level above is seeming impossible, I changed back to magic spec and it‚Äôs still ridiculous.
I was level 25 and there was a quest where you get ambushed by a group of 4 level 30 dwarfs, took me like 6 deaths but I got them in the end and found the quest was way above my level later. Now yesterday I was in Toussaint and I literally died 50time trying to do a quest that was the same level as I was. 
Just venting, Don‚Äôt get me wrong I really love Toussaint, it‚Äôs  gorgeous, but it‚Äôs also the damn crucible.",5,1584799312,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fmfeo4/difficulty/,witcher,1

fm9vvc,Goofiestchief,I did a survey on the fanbase's personal perceptions of the Witcher canon across multiple subreddits.," 

I was curious to see how the fanbase's personal headcanons were regarding the full Witcher saga and what they personally viewed as ""fanon"" or fan canon. I thought Reddit was a useful tool to find diverse perspectives in this regard due to the existence of subreddits. For the majority of this survey, I was mainly referring to the games and whether or not fans viewed them as a proper continuation of the Witcher canon.

For some posts I made, I worded the question differently. Sometimes it would just be ""do you consider the games canon?"" and others would be ""do you consider CDPR a second author?"" or I would ask people what their personal ending to the Witcher saga was.

I went to [r/Witcher](https://www.reddit.com/r/Witcher/), r/wiedzmin, [r/netflixwitcher](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/), and [r/Witcher3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Witcher3/) and even [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/). Some were mixed, some were more game centric, some slightly favored the books and the books alone as the only real canon. I said that I was mainly referring to the games but I did post once on [r/netflixwitcher](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/) asking people if there were moments in the show that were now ingrained in their headcanon which had some interesting results. I did not include posts that had a different solution such as their own head canon being different from both the games AND the books.

I counted each reply left in my posts and at the end of it all, my estimated numbers came to:

39 people who personally viewed the games as canon.

29 people who did not view the games as canon.

Understand that these are not exact and were entirely based upon my own subjective viewing of their replies and my own opinion on what they were saying. I went over the posts multiple times and had different numbers most of the time. Hypothetically, you could probably add or remove 3-5 tallies to each based on your own subjective view of each person's comment. I did my absolute best to try to be unbiased when I counted them and I doubt (and also hope not) that I got them so wrong that the whole data result is wrong and there were were actually more people who didn't view the games as canon.

It's also a very dense game world. I beat it once, and found that I had outleveled the vast majority of content. I notice story missions give out more experience than regular missions. So I guess my question is basically this:

If I show up in Velen after 100%ing white orchard, can I safely ignore all main story quests without hitting any road blocks? I know there must be a couple because (for example) I went to Dandilion's brothel and there were only vagrants there. But I was thinking it'd be cool to do a play through of just regular witching - clearing monster nests, taking contracts, generally avoiding story content to avoid becoming overleveled. Then, later I could go back and do all the story stuff and burn through it without difficulty because I'd become powerful. Is that viable?

fm5b9j,Dr-Edward-Poe,Toad Prince Tips,"I just beat the Toad Prince on Death March. I was level 74. The suggested level was 81. Here are some tips for beating him.

Use cursed oil, especially if you're an alchemy build. If you are, pair it with Poisoned Blades.

Northenwinld completely freezes him for two or three seconds.

Setting him on fire does a lot of damage as well, but using igni is too risky, instead use Dancing Star followed by Dragon's Dream to set him on fire, and spend your stamina on quen.

Get Undying and Active Shield. I don't want to hear, ""Oh, my build isn't based around melee."" I'm an alchemy build from school of Manticore; do you see me moaning?

Use Cat potion for better visibility.

No decoctions unless it's Raffard's.

Have White Honey because you're going to use Swallow a lot, and you need to be able to lower your toxic masculinity/femininity.

Now, to the fight.

The key is to constantly move. Dodge. Don't roll; you need to save your stamina.

Do the Bloodborne strategy; hug his ass.

Whenever the sides of his mouth shine, he's going to attack with its mouth.

His mouth attacks are: spitting venom (short-distance, long-distance), launching his tongue, and thrashing his tongue around.

You can dodge to the sides to avoid the venom.

In order to avoid the tongue thrashing, you need to be on his side completely; otherwise, it'll hit you.

The long tongue launch is a toss. Have quen in case it hits you.

The attack where he launches venom from his back has an aoe effect where the venom drops leave a cloud of poison where they land. Always keep an eye out for the poison cloud. It's easy to get preoccupied with the fight and fail to notice the clouds.

When you're on his sides, he may try to kick you; roll out of the way. The dodge may work, but don't risk it unless you're worth the medallion around your neck.

If you stay close to him, you'll never need to worry about the long-distance venom spit.

He has three different types of jumping.

Two types are easy to avoid. One is jumping away from you, which does not require you to do anything. The second one is him jumping towards you, which may require a dodge depending on the distance between the two of you.

The third one needs dodging. If you're not facing him, he'll jump, and when he lands, he will be facing you. If he jumps, doge because his landing has an aoe effect. This combined with his venom spit can be abused. Hit him in the face with a light attack, then dodge to his side. He'll spit venom then jump. When he lands, he'll be facing you. Do the light attack again. Keep repeating this and abuse the shit out of his retarded ass.

Don't be scared of his intimidating and disgusting look. Stay close to him if you want to stay alive.

Don't let the adrenaline get the better of you when his health is low. Don't think, ""Oh, his health is low; let me rush him. I've already won."" Remember Hjalmar's quote, ""Don't count your fish until they're in your boat, witcher.""

My last advise, don't die.

Good luck master witcher.",6,1584747709,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fm5b9j/toad_prince_tips/,witcher,1

As most of the world has gone into self-isolation/quarantine I wanted to do a new play through of TW3. Only issue is that I sold my PS4 a few months ago and now only have my laptop to play on. 

The laptop specs are fine to run the game, only problem is that the graphics card is really poor. It‚Äôs an AMD Radeon 520 with 2G GDDR5. 

Just wanted to know if there are any mods I can use to run the game adequately or if it isn‚Äôt worth it all to try. If that‚Äôs the case, any recommendations?

I have made numerous songs with the singer of the Skellige soundtrack. I've also made some Witcher-inspired combat tunes using virtually the same instruments as Percival.

Thing is, I think it would do the songs justice to have them put into a mod? I think the community would love it! I've read somewhere that making a music mod for TW3 is very difficult, let me know if you know anybody or anyone here have some knowledge on how to go about this? Thank you

I thought Wild Hunt was the ending for me with the feeling of an ending. After 3 days i decided to play both DLC and i can say that i loved it even more than i thought. The feeling you get to play more and more with the rich story that the game contains is AMAZING.

To be honest i'm sad that the game has come to an end. I've done so many sidequests in any games, but it was never that good as in The Witcher. Now i'm sitting like what i'm gonna do with my life. I thought other games had the best stories. I'm happy i played this game.

So is this the real ending of Geralt of Rivia? Sitting by with Yennefer enjoying their days? No more being a witcher? Will there be a new game about Geralt of Rivia?

I've seen ppl talking about Ciri as the main character in a new game, but how good can she be?

Short, i wished the story of Geralt of Rivia could've been longer than so short (more games). I feel so empty right now with not knowing what to do.

fltz0r,PubliusVirgilius,[SPOILERS] Why freeing the Tree Spirit is the better decision. (In my oppinion),"So like many I had difficult time to decide what to do in that quest, and did some research before I made the decision.
And I am not regretting freeing the Spirit at all:

- 5 Children are saved 

Baron and his Wife:
- Anna is a cheating bitch and got the punishment she deserved, besides that, she never wanted to go back to the Baron, hated him and made a deal with the Crones
- The Baron is an idiot for wanting to stay with a woman who cheated on him,not respecting him and tried to murder him multiple times. He also killed the lover, even though Anna is guilty as well, maybe even more.

The villagers:
- The village people are cultists and fanatics, who are ready to sacrifice their children just to please the Crones

The Crones:
- they are much more evil than the Tree Spirit, they eat children and enjoy the power they have.

-I don't buy the story from the book, that they had to stop their mother (the tree spirit)because she was evil.
They also are shown as attractive women on the tapestry, but the reality is very different.
So I assume its the same with this story.

- They tried to kill/eat Ciri, or at least hand her over to Imlerith

The Tree Spirit:

-I don't think the Spirit is neither good, nor evil. Its the nature.
It kept the promise regarding the children and would it be really evil it would have tried to attack Geralt after he freed it.",27,1584706201,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fltz0r/spoilers_why_freeing_the_tree_spirit_is_the/,witcher,1

I sit here pondering the possibility of a new addition to the series and find myself upset with the realisation that the next game may not feature the white wolf as it's main protagonist. Geralt has been my extended avatar for the last decade of my gaming within the world of the witcher and in the same way ""change"" challenges the human race, i feel challenged to accept that Geralt may well be done with his adventure in my life time. 

I get that a game with Ciri as the protagonist will be enjoyable and i will defiantly play the game, though i am left wondering, if i will be the only one wishing to be in control of the white wolf the entire time i'm playing the new addition to CD Projeckt Reds game library? 

I still sit here hoping for the return of the White Wolf and i really find it hard to believe that i am the only one that feels this way.

And if the Wild Hunt is to be considered the end of all these characters stories, how can she still be narcissistic unlikable character from the first story to the last. More so why does Geralt fall in love with her, is he some dunce obsessed with the smell of Lilac and Gooseberries, or just a masochist?

flmbcm,mastartyna,Anyone else found themselves crushing on voice acting in the games?,"I realise it might sound a little silly, but I‚Äôm strangely drawn to voice acting and character performance in the Witcher games.

I‚Äôve loved the books for years. They‚Äôre something every Polish person grew up with during my childhood. I didn‚Äôt quite like the original Polish film and tv series at the time they came out (2001-2002 if I remember correctly), so it sort of killed the vibe, but the very first Witcher game ignited the fire again. The Netflix show brought the heat up to 11. But regardless of how well portrayed the characters in the series are, the voice acting in the games is what does it for me!

Extremely well performed (well, maybe apart from Triss, she sounds weird) with an attention to cultural variety. I‚Äôve played them all in both English and Polish and I‚Äôve been very impressed. I‚Äôm myself a sound engineer/designer, so naturally quite attentive to such aspects, but no other game has made me so drawn to the voice performance. I‚Äôve done a fair amount of work in this field, too. There are some fantastic character performance artists on the scene and a small group of them sweep up majority of AAA projects. Nevertheless, nothing does it for me like the Witcher series does!

Also, I think I‚Äôm crushing on Mark Healy now, haha. Accidental fan girl. I‚Äôve heard him in other games and he‚Äôs always consistently great, but when mixing with the rest of Witcher actors, there‚Äôs a spark;p Also Zoltan is even better than I imagined when reading the books.

flh06n,ImaJillSammich,Anyone else think an Essi Daven episode could still be possible?,"I had only finished up to the prequel books by the time I watched the show, but one of the few disappointments I had of the Netflix adaptation was that there was no episode dedicated to Essi Daven. After more complete viewings of the first season, I definitely understand why, and what they were trying to do with the stories they did use in episodes. The creators did a great job of adapting the moments that shaped and changed Geralt as a person, and intermixing them with the start of the main novels. Little Eye didn't have much a place in the central conflict of the show thus far, but I hold out hope that she could serve a role in a future episode. Anticipating further exploration of the relationship between Yen and Geralt in the show, I feel like they could still do a flashback episode taking place sometime when Geralt and Jaskier were still traveling together, but after Geralt and Yen met. At this point in the show it doesn't appear that &gt;!Geralt and Yen have spent nearly as much time together as they had in the books (although their past together could still be elaborated on more in future episodes)!&lt;, so I genuinely feel that if done well, the Little Eye story could be adapted in a way that delves deeper into the bond between Yen and Geralt, add to some dimension to the conflict surrounding their tumultuous relationship, and &gt;!give Jaskier some character depth, as the story did for him in the book!&lt;.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I don't have friends who are interested in reading the books, so I wanted to start a thread to see if anyone had thoughts on the matter!

flbu2t,EchoWhiskey_,Show Cahir &amp; Vilgefortz suck.,"Book and games fan here - Show Cahir &amp; Vilgefortz are miscast and poorly written.

I appreciate that they may want to hide who Cahir actually turns out to be bookwise, as someone who pursued Ciri at Emhyr's order but then grew to defend her, until later on in the show. But they didn't even hint that Cahir has this complicated future ahead of him at all. Most non-book'ers probably think he's a straight up bad guy, when in bookland he is more of a Jamie Lannister type. I guess Jamie doesn't come around to being a good guy until midway through season/book 2 and 3 but he's at least  an interesting character and charmingly portrayed. 

I also don't think actor was that good, he was usually just like I'M A BAD GUY! But I think it may have been an issue with the writing as well, he may not have had a lot to work with. 

Vilgefortz I think just sucks. Bland actor, don't get me started on the bad diversity casting, and we also dont see his motivations, or even a hint of them. We're made to think he's on the good guy magicky side because he fights Cahir. 

Anyway these are two minor characters that turn out to have a pretty big influence on the overall Saga story, that could have been far better rendered as story footholds for later on.",35,1584631582,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/flbu2t/show_cahir_vilgefortz_suck/,witcher,1

I was able to find the herbalist, Tomira, for the buckhorn, however, I already had buckhorn on me, and therefore the prompt never came up. 

So now I have the Griffin contract active, but not sure how to complete it (I even tried going to Vesemir, but that did nothing even after I told him I had the buckhorn). 

Anyone else run into this issue?",10,1584594613,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fl4euv/griffin_on_new_game_glitch/,witcher,1
fl4es1,theloneshewolf,Witcher Physiology: Facts and Speculation,"Hello all, I'm still fairly new to the Witcher series but I have fallen head over heels in love with it! I'm still only on the first game, but I confess to looking up spoilers on the Witcher wiki simply because I find the world of Witcher so fascinating and want to learn more about it. So with that, today I bring you a discussion on witcher physiology! I apologize ahead of time if anyone has made a similar post in the past (which, let's face it, is pretty likely) but I hope to add to the subject as well by gathering what is currently known about witcher physiology in one place and perhaps adding my own two cents with a bit of speculation and extrapolation. I'm not a biologist, but I have taken some college-level biology and am also a psychology major. Fair warning though, this might get pretty long. I greatly hope someone will find this post useful and perhaps even entertaining. I also greatly encourage all of you to chip in, add things I might've missed, correct any mistakes I might've made, and even debate some of the things that I and others have to say! I will be drawing from both the games and the books. Remember to keep it civil, and here we go!

First off, the basics. Thanks to their mutations, witchers have superhuman strength, speed, endurance, durability, senses, and healing. Though formidable, witchers often enhance their abilities even further with potions, and even regular humans may kill a witcher if they are skilled enough or outnumber him (or just get lucky). Witchers can take a greater beating than ordinary humans can, and they heal more quickly, too, meaning they can survive injuries that may kill the average person. They have fast reflexes, allowing them to react more quickly than a human could against fast monsters. They seem to have heightened senses, being able to hear, smell, and see more than humans can, particularly in the dark although even witchers need either Cat potions or torches to see in really dark places. Speaking of cats, they all have yellow, cat-like, eyes. Geralt has white hair, too, but so far he is the only witcher in the series shown to have white hair. He underwent further mutations besides the Trial of Grasses and is the only one to have survived them, causing his hair to turn white. In general witchers appear to be fairly fit and muscular, but this may simply be the result of extensive training and exercise, rather than their mutations. 

Witchers also appear to possess a slight immunity to poisons, although they can be poisoned just like anyone else. They also might be slightly immune to certain forms of mind manipulation? I'm not certain, I'm just basing this off a rumor I heard about Geralt resisting Triss' magical manipulation. Witchers are also immune to infectious disease, meaning they cannot get sick (though I'm not certain if that means they can't spread disease either). Presumably this extends to sexually-transmitted diseases as well, so lucky them lol. Witchers have a reputation as being rather promiscuous, which I suppose they can afford to be since there is no danger of them impregnating anyone (or getting pregnant) and no danger of them getting or transferring STDs. Strangely though, they are still capable of getting infections from infected wounds it seems. I haven't read it myself but I heard that in one of the books Geralt comes down with an infection from one of his wounds. I also do not know if witchers can still get non-communicable diseases such as cancer. One would think with all their mutations, they would be at greater risk of getting cancer, actually. Witchers also age slower and (as I mentioned earlier) are infertile. 

They respond differently to potions than regular humans do, too. Certain potions that might harm humans can have beneficial effects on witchers. They also appear to be able to tolerate more potions than the average human who might die from drinking too many of them. This, in addition to their immunity to poisons, leads me to believe that witchers' mutations greatly alter their endocrine systems. Their livers must be much more efficient and durable than the average human's as well, which would explain how Geralt can out-drink most anyone lol, including a dwarf like Zoltan in the first game. Of course, again, even witchers have their limits and can pass out from intoxication or suffer negative consequences if they drink too many potions and their toxicity level gets too high. By and by, this is a bit off topic, but has anyone else noticed that in the first game all potions require a strong alcohol as their base? In which case, does that mean witchers are perpetually tipsy? XD

I do not know as much about their nutrition requirements nor other day-to-day needs. Presumably witchers have many of the same needs as regular humans. They do seem to need sleep, though perhaps not as much as humans? Apart from that, obviously they still have to go to the bathroom and clean themselves and eat. Their diets probably don't differ that much from that of a regular human's, although I imagine witchers do probably eat more and have a higher caloric intake thanks to their faster metabolisms and highly active lifestyles (as any athlete will tell you). I am uncertain as to their ability to withstand extreme temperatures such as extreme heat and extreme cold. They have higher endurance and stamina, so they don't tire out as quickly as humans do but even witchers eventually wear out and need to rest. They probably have higher levels of pain tolerance as well.

I do not know if witchers have any ""weaknesses"", at least none that don't also apply to humans. I do wonder if perhaps they are somewhat affected by silver as well since they consume mutagens which often include body parts from slain monsters (which are weak to silver, at least in the games). I think that would be a neat little achilles' heel to balance out how insanely overpowered witchers are lol. It would also beg the question, by consuming monsters' body parts in order to better fight them, are witchers not themselves becoming more and more like monsters? Are witchers humans (and other mortal creatures) that have given up part of their humanity (elfinity? dwarfinity?) to become like that which they fight? Sorry, I'm waxing a bit philosophical. XD

Anyhow, sorry again for the long post! Feel free to skip around and only respond to the parts that interest you lol.

fl1e0m,promitheas17j,"I should be able to run Witcher 2, but FPS is terrible"," Hey guys, what follows a is a copy paste from r/witcher2, where its been several days and I haven't got any replies:

&gt;Hey everyone, Ive had The Witcher 2 in my steam library for some years now, but couldn't play it because of potato laptop. Now, a friend of my brothers built me a custom pc, nothing too fancy, but its good for the money I paid.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have an RX580 with latest drivers, i5-6500, and 8 GB ram, however the launcher detects that the best settings for me are the Low spec, and I still get horrible frame rate as soon as I jump into the tutorial. Something like 7-9 fps. If I manually bump it up to medium spec from the launcher, nothing changes, neither for better or worse.  
&gt;  
&gt;I also used [this site](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri) to make sure I cover all the requirements, and it tells me I am good even with the recommended settings. Is this a known problem? What is the problem? And how can I fix it if possible?  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks in advance guys, really want to finally play this beautiful game :D

Something I will add is that I have the steam version.

Anyway, if any of you have any suggestions for me, I'd love to hear them, as I want to finally play this game. Thanks in advance!",5,1584581292,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fl1e0m/i_should_be_able_to_run_witcher_2_but_fps_is/,witcher,1

fkqiy2,V4R1CK_M4R4UD3R,Can witchers cast signs with both hands?,"We already know that witchers cannot cast complex spells (unless they are/were a source... I forgot). But can they cast signs with both hands?

If they can, then that would add so much more variety for the gameplay and the lore (new Witcher school focused on signs other than the school of Griffin).

You'd be able to dual cast a sign, doubling it's effect/impact. You could combine two signs for various effect, ex: Yrden + Igni for a trap that sets the target ablaze.

A Witcher would still need their iron/steel weapons, and to effectively incorporate them with dual casting, we could have something like wolverine claws instead of swords.

fklxmf,Steampunkery,Witcher books as dark fantasy,"Disclaimer: I'm not one of those people here to disparage the Witcher about sexism or misogyny. I'm just here to express my wonderment at how Sapkowski doesn't shy away from anything at all. It's incredible, really. I've never read a series quite like it. 


I've seen some people call the Witcher series dark fantasy. Up until midway through Tower of the Swallow, I was nodding along like, ""yep, guts and murder and rape is pretty dark.""

But holy shit Tower of the Swallow hits like a ton of bricks and literally made me uncomfortable at times (and I've read a lot of fantasy). For instance, when &gt;! Bonhart heavily implies to Ciri that if she doesn't take the fisstech he'll strip her in front of every one and literally apply it anally !&lt; or after &gt;! Angoul√©me says her life was spared so that soldiers could rape her, AND THEN she offers herself to Geralt because ""she knows how to express gratitude."" The way she said it so casually was like she felt it was expected of her. !&lt;

A slightly lighter one but still weirded me out was when &gt;! Hotspurn forced himself on Ciri (which made me feel weird because she was actively pushing him off) and then literally died on top of her !&lt;

Now this isn't to say anything bad about the series. I love the series so far. Sapkowski does a fantastic job of really setting the tone here.

fkfraa,Dr-Edward-Poe,Why Does Triss Stay at Kaer Morhen?,"Since I can't use more than one flair, slight spoiler for the third game at the end.

In chapter two of *Blood of the Elves,* Triss arrives at Kaer Morhen. When she sees the bruises on Ciri, she decides to stay and help the Witchers with Ciri's upbringing. Thing is that her inner monologue sounds like an egotistical stalker.

First off, when she is in bed at night, she thinks about how she enchanted Geralt and started a false relationship with her. She fails to see that what she has with Geralt is not real. She then goes on thinking about how she wants that... How do I say this without getting NSFW? She then thinks about how she misses Geralt's *certain parts*. She then wonders why they have asked for her help instead of Yen's. She draws the conclusion that Geralt and Yen aren't on good terms. Triss then asks that if Yen and Geralt are truly on bad terms then why hasn't Geralt joined her yet, which is creepy. Just because he is not fucking Yen doesn't mean he should drive it deep inside you, so much for staying PG. The chapter ends with Geralt and Triss skinning a goat that Geralt has hunted; during that whole scene, Triss keeps thinking about how much she loves being next to Geralt. There is no way she is staying there because of Ciri.

Another thing is that how much she enjoys embarassing the witchers and seeing them ask her to stay with them. When she is in bed at night, every time she thinks that she has figured out the reason for the witchers summoning her, she starts acting almost like child who's found candy. She gets arousd thinking that she is has figured the witchers out and how she is going to steal their mushrooms.

This woman has some seriously deep seeded issues.

P.S This is not somewhat related to the topic at hand, but it's not 100% necessary to read. I can see how people would dislike Yen's overly sarcastic, somewhat cunty personality, and her being extremly demanding, which I personally don't mind. As a matter of fact, I really like, but at least Yen is not this bad. Yes, she does have some issues as well; I won't deny that, (Spoiler for *The Lady of the Lake*) but she truly loves Geralt and dies for him. Triss does not love Geralt; she is obsessed with him to the point where she acts like a 14-year-old who thinks she's in love with that fourty-something-year-old pop singer.

The best way to put it is that Yen is the more mature woman who makes plans of her own and asks people to follow them. If the said plans fail, she takes responsibility, e.g the gurden of Ferya. If the plans work, well it worked. She also understands that sometimes, the ends do justify the means. Triss is more like a teenager who gets wet by Eskel just touching her hand. In the games she refuses to perofrm necromancy becuase it's not ethical, yet she is completely fine with manipulating Geralt.",59,1584488987,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fkfraa/why_does_triss_stay_at_kaer_morhen/,witcher,2

I kept on waiting for something like that to happen in the books. Something to make her prophetic importance and a child of destiny mean something. 

But that never seemed to happen. Every group she escaped from; the Elves, Vilgefortze, the Sorceresses, just wanted a baby from her. Why are there prophecies about her, when it is her child that is important? The prophecies might as well be about Pavetta or Calanthe if only her child is important. 

I get that she has the power to travel time and space, but she never used that power to do anything other than escape from people that wanted to get her pregnant. I was just annoyed that she was only important because of a child she could have and was ready to be used in that way in multiple occasions and only factors outside of her control changed that outcome. 

I really enjoyed her character for the most part, just thought her importance seemed pointless in the end.",9,1584482809,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fke403/just_finished_reading_the_witcher_books_and_i_do/,witcher,3

If you're curious, I bought a physical copy of TW2 back when it first came out and the only client that I could put it on was GOG because it doesn't come with a Steam key. I really don't want to buy the game twice.

I'm currently in my final year of a Marketing degree and have begun a project on Youtubers!

In particular endorsements, and in the case of this experiment, video game endorsers. As Witcher 3 is probably the most polished and fun to watch game i know people here have class!

As a result i have created not one, but two dreaded surveys! The good news is you don't have to do it, however **there is a ¬£50 amazon voucher up for grabs** for completing just one, and if you do both you get two entries. This is a legit prize signed off by my university, details are found in the surveys.

I hope to report back here on completion of my research for streamers and youtubers wanting to know more about endorsing products :)

Any help would be much appreciated! If you would like to know more about this study please message me :)

But the witcher already has a fast world created with tons of familys, characters, and nations so i think that gives it a good edge in developement.

fk08qq,rap_and_drugs,"Is this an ""Easter egg""? (TW2)","Tl;dr at bottom

I have been playing The Witcher 2 for a little while now. The game feels a bit dated, especially after TW3, but I think there are a lot of nice details that make up for the ""older game"" feeling. It doesn't even really seem that old, honestly, I think TW3 has just spoiled me a bit. 

I have desired a few tweaks in terms of gameplay/aesthetics (specifically no hood on the Blue Stripes Combat Jacket, slightly more forgiving inventory weight limits, and 2 talents per level instead of 1). Haven't been able to find a mod that can sort out the last one for me, as all the mods on nexusmods I've seen for this rely on a ""base_scripts.dzip"" file which can be unzipped/""unpacked"" using the ""Gibbed.RED.Unpack"" tool provided via some other mod; I don't actually have this file, I have something called ""compiled_scripts.w2scripts"" instead. I've been able to use another GibbedRed tool to decompress this, and can modify the source code but I'm not sure how to recompress/recompile it. If anyone knows the answer to this, I'd appreciate it!

I'm not entirely garbage at programming myself, so I figured it would be interesting to explore existing parts of my game's source. I unpacked pack0.dzip and found something a little... questionable. 

    pack0.zip/engine/meshes/occlusion/n****r.w2mg

I've only found one instance of this filename mentioned anywhere online, [here](https://www.gog.com/forum/the_witcher_2/how_to_unpack_the_pack0_dzip_for_modders/post14) where the following comment speculated that it was ""some graphic artist with bad humor"". I'm curious if anyone knows anything about this. Maybe someone with more Twitter accounts than me (0) could tweet CDPR and ask them about it. 

Tl;dr: why is there a file named with the n word in the Witcher 2 source?",3,1584425278,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fk08qq/is_this_an_easter_egg_tw2/,witcher,1

fjuyjh,f1sh_,"I love the books but man, are they hard to get through in parts.","Title. I absolutely love The Witcher books so far. The characters and development of the story along with the world building is amazing. But jeez, does Sapkowski seem to drag out parts to seemingly cram dialog in. Example: Currently reading Baptism of Fire where [Spoiler](/s ""Geralt, Dandelion, Milva and Zoltan are making their way south towards Nilfgaard. They keep running into brutal scenes of the atrocities of war and finally ran into Regis in the Eleven graveyard"") The interactions between the characters, as always, is top notch but man does it drag. I wonder if this whole like 100 pages could have been told with bulletpoints in 20. Compared with the books of short stories I'm finding myself struggling to get through these books. I'm absolutely going to finish them and won't deny I love them, but does anyone else feel they just contain a ton of dragged out scenes for the sake of dialog?

Another thing that bothers me a little less, is I feel extremely confused by the great web of poltics and war. I often have to go read a summary of each chapter I read to make sure I completely absorbed all the information. I think Sapkowoski kind of writes it that way intentionally? As if you're learning things just as Geralt is, where he has a single perspective in a large world with many moving parts. However, it's a bit jarring hearing something like how [Spoiler](/s ""Verden is fighting alongside Nilfgaard and remembering that was mentioned once in the previous books and having to flip backwards and refresh yourself""). Not exactly a criticism, as much as a comment that would make me feel less stupid if other people felt the same way.

Anyway, that's enough rambling about the books instead of reading them. I should really get back to that so I can finally play these games that you guys love so much.",8,1584402033,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fjuyjh/i_love_the_books_but_man_are_they_hard_to_get/,witcher,3

Anyway


Here are some details I missed or would like explained

1)

In his fight with Vilgefortz, who beat the shit out of him, what did Geralt realize too late? Why was he such a good fighter


2)

What was it that Dijkstra (I know I'm probably butchering most of the spelling of these names) say and who did he say it to which caused him to have to run away ... it seems like it was to Phillipa ... but a few pages ago, when reading someone's mind, she says he stays as long as she wanted him too.


3)

The unicorn(s) said that Ciri only gave up a insignificant part of her power in the desert, mere quackery. So why isn't she able to save, as in heal/cure, Geralt at the end ... she says she would have been able to, she knows it, had she not ""given up"" her power.

fj9v5n,SleepingUte0417,Witcher 3 = Tribute to Vesemir,"I‚Äôm replaying The Witcher 3. One thing I‚Äôve noticed, amongst the many brilliant things in this game, is that the entire game seems to be a tribute to Vesemir. 
I can‚Äôt recall them all (i‚Äôll let you all post your favorites!) but so many characters in the game, throughout the game, quote (begrudgingly or not) something that Vesemir once said. You start the game with him. Then there‚Äôs the HoS part with Countess Mignole. It happens up until the end of the main story when.. well won‚Äôt spoil it. 
My favorite part is when Lambert where‚Äôs that cheeky hat and does his Vesemir impressions.

fj8t5y,AfterthoughtCentral,What do YOU want from the next game in the franchise?,"CDPR announced that after Cyberpunk 2077 is released they will begin work on a brand new high-quality AAA game and it is highly implied that it will be a Witcher title (thank god), however, according to multiple news outlets it will not be The Witcher 4. So my question is what would you like the game to be? You would like to carry on playing as Geralt or would you like to take on control of a different character? When and where do you want the game to be set? Do you want a sequel, a prequel or a game set at the same time as the books or even one of the previous games?

In my personal opinion, I am pretty bummed out to learn that it probably won't be The Witcher 4 and this news makes me believe that we will either be playing as Geralt but the game isn't set after The Witcher 3 or we will not be playing as Geralt at all. If I had to choose I would have a game where we play as Ciri that is set after The Witcher 3. There isn't a canon ending from TW3 but for my game concept to work the ending where Ciri becomes a witcher would have to be canon. Ciri's powers would be a fun game mechanic as we would hopefully see her master/learn to control her powers over time. If we play as Ciri it means that the game doesn't necessarily need to be set on the Continent. I would love to visit the world of the Aen Elle, especially Tir n√° Lia. Regardless, I would love to hear other people's ideas on what they would like the next game to be like. You can expand on my idea or propose your own, either way, I would love to have a discussion about the next game, the announcement itself has already got me extremely hyped!",13,1584307253,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fj8t5y/what_do_you_want_from_the_next_game_in_the/,witcher,1

fiyzjr,Arthayance,Just completed the game. save me pls,"Just completed Witcher 3.. and damn does my heart now feels heavy. I am still in disbelief that it is actually over, I tried to delay doing the final quest for so long but knew it would have to come

I knew this would happen and delayed playing past the first game for 3 years, because I am comforted by the thought there is still 2 and 3, and now there is nothing left

I planned to play through the entire series again but I just feel so empty now, and don't see a point since I already know the whole story.

Pls advise on how you guys got over ending the game (if you had similar experience)

Anyways, if anyone is up for some discussion:

Does anyone feel Witcher 2 was a bit too short? 

Anyone else feels a bit put off by the never changing dialogue? Like before the final fight, I kept talking to the characters expecting additional dialogues but there never was.

The ending is too sad, Geralt went through all that to help Ciri but after slaying Eredin it didn't get recognized at all, then he just spawned in Kaer Morhen all empty and alone, was expecting him to at least spawn in Yen's house or something, even all his friends are nowhere in sight, damn if only there was just one final normal monster slaying quest with Ciri

Why didn't anyone help Geralt fight Eredin, and it does feel a bit silly, since Geralt can 1v1 Eredin wouldn't it be better for Ciri and Geralt to team up and annihilate the generals then Eredin together from the start?

Also, I noticed that Lambert is the only one with no changed dialogue during Vesemir's funeral.

Oh well, see you around, Geralt of Rivia :(

fixfjn,kiki_kevin,Witcher 3 make me feel uncomfortable - a newbie finally get it why this game is great.,"I started playing this game last week and I reached a stage where I feel the game is like any other open world I played before. Follow the main story, finish the quests, and enjoy the world created. Yes the content is a lot, the stories are so far good and the RPG elements are very good. But that ‚Äòspecial‚Äô element eluded me. That is until I reached the spirit of the tree choice. 

I read the books and I know Geralt would choose to save the children but having googled the choice and it‚Äôs consequences, I chose to kill the tree as I wanted to give Baron the second chance. However the fucking crones make me hate the choice I made (imagining what they did with the children with those body parts around them) and I hate myself for googling it and make the choice which went against everything I know about Geralt from the books. 

I closed the game and thought about the choices. I realized no matter what I end up choosing, the consequences are both good and bad. Then I understood why you all love this game, why this game won so many awards. Why so many people, despite the game‚Äôs huge content, play through it so many times. 

I need sometime to recover from this choice and go back to the game. The image of those body parts and fate of the children will give me nightmares. I won‚Äôt google shit about this game anymore. Whatever ending I get, I know I will play this game again. Thank you CDRP for this great game and thank you this community for the great tips.",20,1584255454,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fixfjn/witcher_3_make_me_feel_uncomfortable_a_newbie/,witcher,1

finxdz,EmpJoker,Beginning Question.,"This question probably sounds really stupid, and I apologise for that, but bear with me.

So I just started playing Witcher 3, my first Witcher game. I've played a lot of single player games, but the closest I've played to this was DMC, which is massively different. 

The thing is, in my experience with single player games, (Fallout 4, DMC, the Outer Worlds, State of Decay, 7 Days to Die,) I've always hoarded my basic consumables, telling myself I'll one day need them in a boss fight. But in Witcher, I've had a hard time getting by without using them. Most of the fights I've gotten into, (not many, to be fair,) I've stopped to eat a loaf of bread. So far, I've faced what I think were Ghouls, (I can't remember, but it was the first fight after Geralt wakes up from his dream,) some Drowners, which I found really hard, Wolves, Wild Dogs, and a Griffin. 

Am I bad at this game, or does it require more consumable usage? Should I be conserving them?",9,1584213960,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/finxdz/beginning_question/,witcher,1
finw6c,YellowJacketJonas,Spoiler - just finished lady of the lake and I have many questions...,"Just gonna drop these here one by one for some answers.

1. Why does Emhyr let Ciri go after the big battle with Vilgefortz? I suspect he just had a pang of conscience but wow... like the entire novel saga is Emhyr bunting Ciri to fulfill the prophecy. Then one convo with Geralt and he‚Äôs over it?

2. Are Geralt/Yen dead? I read somewhere that Sapkowski said they lived and I think the ending is kind of ambiguous. Are they living in another time/place like the unicorn/elf world where Ciri transports to from the tower of swallows? Would love some insight on that.

3. Speaking of the elves and Unicorns, whatever happened to the elves hunting cori through the different dimensions when she was with the unicorn. They go from threatening to following her forever to, I guess, just stopping after the encounter where the unicorn stays behind?

4. If Geralt died, was Yennefer dying as well or did she just want to go be with him? I was kinda unclear on that point.

5. How exactly does Geralt ‚Äúcome back‚Äù for the video games? What is the plot there?

6. The last Witcher book that came out in 2013, the interquel, is it worth reading? I know it doesn‚Äôt change the overall novel plot but it seems to have relatively mixed reviews. Is it bad?

fim4w5,honi12,Ending of the books makes me depressed (spoiler),"So I read the books several years ago and the ending as I understood it ruins the gaming experience for me. (Geralt and Yen dies and are transported to Avalon to live their afterlife, unable to return to the known world). It feels so fake that Geralt is summoned back to life in the games when everything in the book saga indicates that Geralt is unable to return. This is of course only my own assumption and you may have experienced it differently. To me the death of Geralt and Yen feels so real that I can't believe in any other alternative endings even if I wanted to, even though there might be indications of their resurrection.

This book saga is the best I have ever read and I love all the characters so deeply. I felt really depressed and I cried a lot after the ending of the books. When I look at your beautiful fan art and screen shots of the game, I become so utterly sad because I get reminded of the ending and I feel like their lore can't continue anymore. It is the saddest and most beautiful ending. If they didn't die the way they did their lore would feel less meaningful. 

All this sounds silly even to me, and I was wondering if anyone feels the same. How do you cope with the ending of the books (if you understood it as I did) and continue to enjoy the lore in games etc.?",6,1584207484,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fim4w5/ending_of_the_books_makes_me_depressed_spoiler/,witcher,1
fil4pu,AstralSaiyn,Yennefer,"Firstly I want to say I wanted to start reading the books after I played Witcher 3 not because of the show. 

Now I have read Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, and I am still not sure why people love Yen. When she first appears in Last Wish she pretty much makes Geralt her errand boy. And yet as always for some reason Geralt likes that. Which that is to be expected from Yen I suppose. 

However my biggest issue with her is in Sword of Destiny. She is so cold to Geralt because I believe he left her (honestly who wouldn‚Äôt). But then they get the the old elven village and Geralt and Yen obviously have sex that night. Then come morning Geralt finds out Yen also had sex with Istredd and yen isn‚Äôt even the slightest bit guilty and clearly doesn‚Äôt care about Geralt a feelings (he clearly has some even though Witcher were stripped of emotions). That really bothered me, here is Geralt going wherever Yen wants to go and doing what ever she wants and then she just has sex with another dude not even 24hours later in the same place as Geralt and doesn‚Äôt even feel guilty for it. 

One of the reason I started reading the books was to hopefully understand and come to like Yennefer, but right now that is still not the case. I really hope once I get into the actual story with Blood of Elves and so on that I come to like her. 

This has been eating at me since I first read that and I didn‚Äôt want to post anything until I finished the book.",28,1584203769,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fil4pu/yennefer/,witcher,1

fijwvg,bobturn72,Witcher 3 just isn't my thing?,"Time played - 4 hours

INTRO: I have bought and sold the witcher 3 twice now in an attempt to find what all the fuss was about. I never could get into it. Maybe the game has been over hyped for me? I dont know..   Im going to simplify this and break it up into role playing and gameplay mechanics.

ROLEPLAYING MECHANICS: I'll start here since this is the most important part considering that it is classified as an rpg. I felt Geralt had too much character for me to ""role play as geralt."" The last time I attempted to play the game I watched Geralt talk for 3 minutes straight in a restrictive cutscene that gave me no way of leaving the conversation or control over what geralt was even saying up until I finally had an option at the end. Regardless of how important this option may have been I felt taken out if the experience. I think choice and consequence is extremely important if not most important in an rpg but the way the dialogue works is too cinematic restricting and for me. That's when I decided to sell It for a second time. Maybe I am expecting something the game just isn't which is more of an obsidian rpg. Choose who you want to be and where you want to end up entirely.

GAMEPLAY MECHANICS: I just didn't like the third person navigation at all. Simple tedious tasks of searching through an area or interacting with the environment in an open world game I once did in Bethesda titles now felt more tedious because of the way the controls felt. Not that Bethesda has smooth amazing gameplay by any means but It felt better to me for some odd reason? The combat felt weird too. It was definitely more cinematic for sure and it looked cool but meh. I am currently playing the outer worlds and my character is a melee focused character and I enjoy the simpler stat based combat in that game more than witcher 3's more cinematic floaty and dancy style combat. New vegas had very simple barbones gunplay but I felt more in control?

CONCLUSION: I could go into more details for sure but I'll save myself and everyone else some time. The game doesnt feel good to navigate(doesn't feel awfully though), i dont like the rpg mechanics, and combat is.. Idk? I just dont care for it. It doesnt feel like I have control during combat. I feel like I am watching geralt more than I am being geralt. Maybe this is because I have played very minimal third person games and this is the only third person only role playing game I have tried to really get into but I'm not entirely sure. I use to play the elders scrolls and fallout games in third alot of the time and enjoyed the option of switching. I'd almost rather the game be a bit more linear at times and also the game either be a story driven third person game or be an rpg that has maybe a silent protagonist and more customization of who the character is and more frequent dialogue that isn't cutscene restrictive.

Horse mechanics have to be upgraded - RDR2 as an example.

fig6m7,schoolBS19,"Hearts Of Stone: Who G O'Dimm Is, Plus Shani/Olgierd Theory SPOILERS","First, O'Dimm seems to be more or less a master Hym.  Sort of like their version of a higher vampire.

In this universe, curses uttered near death surrounding bad emotions can create monsters.  There are certain fundamentals to the universe.  I think Hyms are creatures that live in a ""natural ecosystem"" of a higher plane that's nearer to more fundamental forces.  That's why they feed off of pain and so forth.

As a higher Hym, O'Dimm doesn't create pain, he feeds off of pain which already naturally exists.  However, he lives very close to the pure version of this which is described as evil.

I would say that O'Dimm is not evil itself, but he feeds upon and his very essence and body is made of pure evil.  So evil is just a substance, and O'Dimm is made of it (thus is Evil Incarnate), but they are a bit separate.

O'Dimm's main power seems to be his ability to see through time, and also manipulate it.  Evil transcends time, and there are beings such as sources which also have power over time and space, so this power isn't novel, just extraordinary.

O'Dimm exercises his power by knowing the exact time and place to act to achieve what he wants.  This is his main power.  The thing that makes it so effective is that he not only sees events, but he also sees within the human heart.  That's why he's Master Mirror.  Evil, malice.  Hyms feed off of self-guilt. The greatest suffering is self-inflicted as humans are separated from their own innocence and self-love.

Master Mirror merely pulls strings to cause people to see into themselves more deeply than they would hope.  His contracts are likely spells people cast upon themselves, and they must realize for themselves they were fooled and consciously accept their guilt for their soul to be his.  In other words, they willingly give up their souls, out of self-guilt, the greatest victory of evil - because no man could save them.

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

I also think Shani's role in the story is to sort of punish Geralt.  The incident with Vlodomir teaches her that the sort of man she might settle down with isn't even alive (was it her or Olgierd who left the flowers at his tomb afterwards?).  This in turn causes her to give up on a happy normal life and accept the move to the front.  This tears her from Geralt.  Though she is not his destiny, it is a minor punishment inflicted by Master Mirror as a minor torment which the nature of having proximity to him. 

Geralt is able to feel the love Shani would have for him were he a different man, and then realize that because he truly isn't that man, he cannot save her with his love, nor can he have the sweet love he briefly tasted as Vlodomir.

It's basically Master Mirror's way of tormenting Geralt, reminding him of what he misses out on as a Witcher.  Why torment Geralt?  Merely because Mirror is hiring him as a Witcher, and even a stale business contract with Mirror cannot avoid the touch of evil.  His relationship with mirror is as one doing a job, without emotion or attachment.  Simply by filling that role, he is forced to see what this role causes him to miss out on in life.  The touch of Master Mirror.

...

However, I have a theory that if Geralt saves Olgierd, that Olgierd goes to the Eastern front.  He would want to go away somewhere, but is a noble of Redania seeking a new life, new wealth, new glory.  I imagine he'd meet Shani there, and the Vlodomir thing would bond them.  Injured, he'd end up helping her run a hospital, and together they'd devote a life to helping the injured and war veterans.  He'd use his charm and wits to build the charity.

I imagine the two of them would be a good match, and such a humble and serving life would be a fitting redemption for Olgierd.

Thus, by defeating Mirror, and even helping Shani find happiness and Olgierd too, Geralt reverses Mirror's punishment.  Rather than feel he is missing out on a normal life as a Witcher, he gets to see how his work truly defeats evil and truly breathes new life into multiple lives.  He's still lonely and wounded, but he gets to see how this price is worth the cost because of the good it creates in the world.

Symbolically, by defeating O'Dimm, Geralt doesn't change his path in the slightest.  He's still a Witcher, but rather than reflect on what his life causes him to miss, he can reflect on what makes his Path worthwhile.

&amp;#x200B;

fif37w,Lucy-Ann_Black,Multiple English Translations?,"So Netflix uploaded a video a while ago where Henry Cavill read a part of The Last Wish (I am sure a lot of you have seen it) and he read a version of it I have never heard or seen or read (I think) starting with ""As usual, cats and children noticed him first. A striped Tom Cat, sleeping on a sun-warmed stack of wood, shuddered, raised his round head, pulled back his ears, hissed, bolted of into the nettles."" I searched for it online, but could only find pirating sites.  I know it is one of the first chapters of The Last Wish because it has about the same story as The Witcher in The Last Wish, but it is written differently so I was wondering, I can't imagine Netflix giving Henry a Fan Translation but like I said I can't find it any where to buy. Does any one have an idea or know more? Are there multiple Translations? Or is it maybe an older Translation or something?

fid6jr,yvael_tercero,Yennefer and Politics,"In the game Yennefer gets called out many times, even by Geralt, for being into politics. It is put forward as one of her basic traits. Having read the books first, this doesn't make sense to me. Yen is no Phillips Eilhart, who is all about politics, and especially after Time of Contempt. Even Triss, whose political activity is never mentioned, is considerably more involved than her, being advisor to a king and then a loyal member of the lodge.

The first and only time in the books where we get to see a somewhat political Yen is in the events of Thanedd. We learn she is a member of the council. As the story progresses, we get to see the coup, where we later learn she hadn't taken any sides, and didn't even know that either of the conspiracies were hatching. 

From this point, she drops politics for good. At this stage, she is already fully committed to finding Ciri and Geralt, and dumps the lodge and politics in the process. She is not interested in Philippa's dirty scheming. 

In Lady of the Lake, the conclusion of the story, Yennefer's character is all about the two people in the world who she cares about, Ciri and Geralt, and politics don't have the slightest important in the mix.

**TL;DR: You can get White Wolf's Silver Sword from Adam Badowski's personal collection and all money will be given to save a little kid's life - here's the link to the** [auction](https://charytatywni.allegro.pl/en/miecz-wiedzminski-i11761021).

Long story short - my friend's son, Kacper, has a genetic disorder that slowly kills him, called SMA. His parents are gathering money to send him to States for a life-saving therapy, but the treatment costs \~2,5 million dollars (or 7 mln polish zloty). As you can imagine, it's an unbelivable amount of money. 

They are currently around 400k USD (1,5 mln PLN) from the goal, but they have only couple of weeks to reach it. 

I rarely get involved directly in such things, but this kid is same age as my daughter. 

As a person working in CDP, I've reached to Adam Badowski, head of the studio, and asked him if there's anything witcher related he can offer to the auction, so we can help Kacper plus make some noise around the charity. Adam decided to pass a truly amazing item - White Wolf's Silver Sword from his personal collection.

fi53fu,Shouvanik,Need clarification about a few things around Yantra,"Yantra is the town where the little red quest occurs(a werewolf and her bandits comes to attack the village) and in hearts of stone, O'Dimm meets you at crossroads near the village at midnight. Now there are some things I noticed around the village, do these lead to anything or just for immersion?

There's a girl talking to her mother near the crossroads. She started with Mommy, can trees walk? and proceeded to describe a leshen that is lurking in woods outside town. I checked a bit in the forests in both directions from the town and found wolves, bear, wraiths and some arachnids. Is there really a leshen?

Also near that girl and the children who are singing the O'Dimm song, there is a notice that a beast is ravaging the cattle and everything. There's a weekly meeting which is scheduled at Yantra inn this week. Yantra inn doesn't seem to have anyone in there to talk with actual dialogue tree, not even an innkeeper. So is there a quest regarding this?(maybe time specific?)",6,1584127059,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fi53fu/need_clarification_about_a_few_things_around/,witcher,1

fi1vys,JVIuRRaY,(SPOILERS) Self made custom characters vs preset storylines and personalities.,"Hey there guys, first post in this sub, and maybe my maybe my fourth ever on reddit so my apologies if I haven‚Äôt marked this correctly. Let me know and I‚Äôll edit it. 

So, with Cyber Punk coming out (fairly) soon, I‚Äôd like to ask your opinions regarding RPG‚Äôs in general, but mostly on a new Witcher game. 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people hyping up CDPR ( which is totally justified ) but when ever the potential Witcher 4 conversation comes up, I see a lot of people saying they‚Äôd like to be able to make their own Witcher and their own story. Would this work? Not only engine wise, but story wise? See, I love RPG‚Äôs in which I can create my own character ( Baldurs Gate for one, and more recently most of the Bethesda and Obsidian Elder scrolls/fallout games. 

I do however believe that some of the best games I‚Äôve played have been single character focused and the dev makes you play an actual character they‚Äôve created, rather than a character in which you‚Äôve hand made. Geralt, Arthur Morgan, even Kratos and Doom Guy were characters I had no control over In terms of atheistics or back story and some of my most loved characters ever. This is mainly off of the back that Geralts story, and I believe the devs said this, is pretty much done now.

Do you believe that the next Witcher will be a custom made character, or will they feature an already established character ( Vesimir, Ciri, etc) and what are you guys hoping for? 

Thank you people, looking forward to hear your view on this! Save me from this conflicted thoughts process!",11,1584115236,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fi1vys/spoilers_self_made_custom_characters_vs_preset/,witcher,1

It was very well made but I personally found the difficulty off-putting. Despite 20-30 hours gameplay, I couldn't get into it.

I've been looking for something in between. A good mod list that makes the game feel different, but maintains the original spirit. (Note that I have not tried other full overhauls like Ghost Mode but am open to them.)

Since W3 doesn't have a good mod manager like MO2, I'd like to avoid lists with &gt;100 mods, like the [Total Immersion Mod List](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3735).

fhp4zb,SPH03N1X,"Yes, I Am Tardy To The Party. Show Mercy!","It was a snowball effect, you see...

I watched the Netflix series first. *(I loved it.)*  Wanting to know more, I did the internet thing.  The internet thing said, ""Well, if you liked that, play The Witcher 3!""

... So, I did that. 5 times, give or take, who's counting?! 

ANYWAY!

After my play-through, I did the internet thing again. Mostly trying to figure out who this person was, and what that reference meant, and OhMyGodShouldIPickYenneferOrTriss?!

... Which brought me here.

Something something **Aerondight**. Something something **Iris' Saber**. Something something *""Read these books, in this order, for an immersive play-through.""*

AH HA!!! Okay!

So, I just finished the first book, ""The Last Wish"" (hehe).  And now, I'm sad.

""Why are you sad?"" I hear you say. Well, I'll tell you. 

Now, after reading the first book, I don't much like the Netflix adaptation anymore. It's still good! That much is true. But if I'd read the books first, I'm not certain I would've bothered with the show.  It's not *(entirely)* because ""The Lesser Evil"" was trimmed down to the point of confusion. Or *(entirely)* because ""A Question of Price"" was given the TL;DR treatment. I understand the production crew had a set amount of time and resources to work with. I know they couldn't give us every detail the book provides. But they DID have enough time to put Geralt and Dandelion in several scenes together. Giving the viewer an idea of their relationship. I started these books with the preconceived notion that Geralt hated Dandelion. I mean, like an annoying mosquito just buzzing around Geralt's head.

... But that's not how it was at all. They were legitimately friends. Geralt didn't feel some guilt-ridden obligation to save his life. He *wanted* to. So, why make the opposite seem true in the show?

Anyway, where was I going with this post... After finishing the first book, and beginning the second, I'm anxious to jump back into the game. How many of the books should I complete beforehand? Tempted, though I may be, I want to understand the references in the game. So if I must read all of them first, I will. I'm enjoying this world that much.

Thank you for giving this post your time!

fhjzaw,AutoAltRef6,"""Yer kind don't work fer free""","Why do some characters in the Witcher universe make a point of emphasizing this, as if it makes witchers some special snowflakes? Are there Toussaint-style white knights everywhere, killing monsters for glory and thus providing competition of sorts and setting a precedent that monster killing is a hobby, not a profession? I haven't seen any, they must all be taking an extended break at the same time. Or is it the norm in the Witcher world for people who practice a trade to not demand compensation for their services? If that's the case, what are the various currencies used for then?

As someone who's only played the games and only really remembers The Witcher 3, a character mentioning that witchers don't work for free always made me cringe a bit. Well excuse fucking me, Your High Excellency. Lemme just go and take care of that monster problem that's threatening the lives of everyone in the entire village, and don't you dare to insult me by trying to pay me. Would you like a BJ and a handie as well? What the heck, might as well drop by trousers and bend over so ya'll can have your way with me, since witchering is supposedly about as appreciated as prostitution, except even whores are allowed to ask for money.

Is this something that's well justified and explained in the novels/short stories, or is it something the game(s) made up? Because the way it's presented in TW3 makes it seem like yet another bad justification for people bite the hand that feeds them, or in this case the hand that prevents a hostile takeover by Monsters, Inc.",8,1584033951,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fhjzaw/yer_kind_dont_work_fer_free/,witcher,0
fhjuhq,the-astroxr,(maybe) Unpopular opinion on the next witcher game and general thoughts.,"First of all, im no expert of the witcher series, at all, but I have played the witcher 2 and 3 (very recently) and  seeing the news of them starting to develop a new witcher game and it not being a direct sequel to the 3rd got me a bit worried, and here is why:
What I think is so great about the witcher games is how they manage to create a bond between you, the characters and the world the game itself takes place in; you get attached to characters such as Geralt ,ciri, yennefer, triss and a lot of other not main characters such as the baron, Anna Henrietta, Regis etc. You start to love how they have different ways of talking, different emotions towards Geralt.

Now lets talk about Geralt. I'm pretty sure cdpr already stated that they wanted Geralts storyline to be a Trilogy, and I'm fine with that, even though in my opinion one of the main reasons the witcher 3 is so great is because of Geralt himself, which is in my opinion an amazing developed and thought out character since the first book probably. As I said though, I think it couldld be fine not having him in a new witcher game, as they already said it's not gonna be a direct sequel.

Now lets get into my ""unpopular"" (don't even know if it's that unpopular)  opinion:
I've seen countless comments and suggestions even from years back stating that they would love a  game where they could choose a witcher school and slay monsters level up and upgrade their character. In my opinion, this would honestly be pretty bad simply because it will be one of those games where you feel like your character doesn't give a shit about what's going on, and the story will probably be pretty bad as you don't grow attached to it, you just feel like an outcast in the whole storyline. 

What I would  like to see  is a continuation to ciri s story or maybe vesemir/eskel/Lambert's story narrated in the cdpr way.",19,1584033482,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fhjuhq/maybe_unpopular_opinion_on_the_next_witcher_game/,witcher,1

fhjhiu,Cezaros,Some Gwent Questions,"Hi! I've started playing Witcher 3 some time ago and I was really caught up by Gwent. It's a really nice game, a good interlude between quests, but some things have been bothering me and i can't find the anwsers to them.

1. As we know from Mousesack in Mousesack gwent lessons quest there are more and more people playing gwent. Gwent originated as  dwarven card game and quickly was promoted by people that started playing it (i think they were from Northern Kingdoms?). So the number of players is growing constantly. *Who creates the gwent cards?* If number of players is growing, number of carda has to be as well. Is there some sort of dwarven entity creating cards?

2. If cards can be created, why is noone cheating and creating false cards for themselves? People play thia game for money after all, so sooner or later someone will try to create strong cards without winning / buying them. What then? And why isn't anyone selling those false cards? From Zoltan's card quest we know that some of them are literally worth hundreds of coins.

3. Is there some sort of special water mark or something on those cards? If so, why is noone checking it while we play Gwent?

4. Why isn't gambling taxed by laws? It is in most countries and with Gwent being so incredibly popular why aren't countries putting additional taxes on Gwent games and on selling cards?",8,1584032146,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fhjhiu/some_gwent_questions/,witcher,1

fhg9lt,Careless-Talk,"Just finished the main novels, my main take away is...","I don't think I like Geralt.

I just finished the main series of novels (still have Season of Storms to go) and my main take away is: I don't really like book Geralt

He spends a lot of the books moody and complaining, he's a dick to a lot of his companions (especially Dandelion), he's overly obsessed with Yennefer and does everything she tells him to do, and he isn't really a witcher in the novels. 

He's certainly heroic at times, but so are many other characters and they're much more likeable.

I did play the games first so I'm probably a little biased, but I much prefer CD Projekt Red's version of Geralt, he was more fun, likeable and had no existential crisis whenever he had the chance to help someone other than Yennefer or Ciri (which happens all the time in the books).

Maybe something a bit (couple of hundreds of yeats) after the Conjunction of Spheres.  
This setting could maybe let us select our school and create our own witchers.

Anyhow, now I'm wondering did I make a mistake? Am I locked into a romance now with Triss? What happens if I meet a romanceable female character later on in the game, can I still romance her? Would it count as cheating if I did? And are there any consequences to having multiple relationships in this game? (Well, consequences other than feeling like a complete jerkwad for toying with several girls' hearts I mean.) Sorry for all the questions, lol, I just want to be sure I haven't committed to anyone too early in the game. Also, if I go back and don't sleep with Triss in the prologue, can I still romance her later if I decide I do want Geralt to be with her?

Do you think reinstall would help or is it just a state the game is in right now? I have a crappy internet so reinstall is quite a big endeavor for me.

PS: I'm not playing GOTY, because I had already installed the game and am not sure how to move the saves anyway.",11,1583962175,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fh4rfy/witcher_3_is_full_of_buggs/,witcher,1

Best part of it, it connected all the loose ends. I still think about all series and say to myself how lucky I am just because I read the series. I wanted to say how wonderful it is.

Some fragments were left out. Ves running to hit a switch. Ves appearing outside the Sigil room. Some Roche stuff.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**-Random Notes-**  
-Yeah, Roche was captured. When though? During the events of SQ313?  
-Talar. Only one fragment. Reconnaissance stuff.  
-Ves. Combat role.  
-Iorveth. Sigh... did they really have to nuke him from the game files?  
-Mr. Mirror's role? No idea. In MQ1053(SQ311?), Geralt encountered the demon while inside Martin's residence(military brothel replaced it).  
-The ""Martin Officer"" variant that Geralt fought in SQ308 was listed as a ""lvl 11 mini boss"".   
-Unrelated oddity? The witcher Kiyan(th1003_guard_kiyan), that fought Geralt in ""Scavenger Hunt: Cat School Gear"", is marked as ""Deamon #3"". The game files contained entries for Deamon #1, Deamon #2, Deamon #3 and a ""Commander""(Beryt Commander?). If this in fact was recycled content, where did it come from originally?  
-Var Rechte(SQ311) might've guest starred as a rotting corpse that Geralt could loot.  
-The dispensary guards would not have been hostile towards Geralt.  
-Gas chamber. Meant for discovery via exploration or a part of the quest's plot?  
-A chase sequence... that might have extended outdoors? Sounds... fun...  
-Pre-SQ314 content. Plague Pit refugee area. Refugees/Infected Peasants(Men,Women,Children). Nilfgaardian rangers, officers, and soldiers. Peasants could be seen digging graves just outside the camp.  
-Post-SQ314 content. ""Rescued Women"" inside Roche's Camp.  
-One of the requirements for the ""SQ314 Ves Sex"" scene would've been the death of a ""nilfgaardian general"" named *Bob*(SQ312). Killing *Bob* also possibly unlocked an additional nighttime dialog sequence with Ves. Patrick Mills' comments finally come in handy(Just ask him about Iorveth. No, really. HE LOVES IT)...  
  
""they have a really nice scene together where they talk about constellations and elven mythology""  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
The lazaret fellows seemed convinced of Redania's involvement...  
  
""Gruggh‚Ä¶ To arms! Fire‚Ä¶ **Radovid's** at the gates‚Ä¶ Cough‚Ä¶ To arms!""  
""Ha ha‚Ä¶ it's all a joke‚Ä¶ one big bloody joke‚Ä¶""  
""Cough‚Ä¶ Sword‚Ä¶ Give me my sword!""  
""No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!""  
""No‚Ä¶ **Redania** won't get me here‚Ä¶ Let me go! Let me go!""  
  
This *might* have something to do with the events of **SQ313(Devil's Trick)** ...  
-Whatever you want to call it... ""Devil's Trick""(Leak Files), ""Redanian Ruse""(Game Files) &amp; ""Hospital""(Game Files).  
-A rough outline of SQ313 is damn near impossible.  
-""Redanian Ruse"" seemed to revolve around flares, signal fires, smoke signals, plot holes... and a burning tower?  
-In a previous quest(SQ309), Geralt investigated an abandoned mine(GR1) in Greyrocks. The caves inside the quarry served as a ""burial cavern"" for the Sanatorium's ""patients"". In SQ313, Geralt gets the chance to take a tour of that Sanatorium.  
-Some sort of escape/rescue operation(that involved Ves) took place on a burning ship.  
-Radovid refused to lend support. No doubt about it. That's the problem though, he *cannot* agree... Eh, whatever.  
-The Blue Stripes had a snitch. Hortensio? Or possibly one of the other three named blue stripe guerillas?  
-Roche is captured. It being the 13th century and all, Ves becomes leader of the Blue Stripes. Her dead eyes and blank stare thoroughly boosted morale.  
-Great comedy potential. Talar &amp; Iorveth.  
-Quest Interactions. If active, SQ313 disabled MQ1041(Strangers In The Night). https://i.imgur.com/qiFMtT5.jpg  
-Sorta quest related? The Greyrocks region received a complete makeover at some point. Locations were either re-purposed and/or shrunk, or just outright deleted. Oh, and Nilfgaard's presence in the region was heavily reduced.  
-I'm still unsure as to why some dev moved this one useless location over to the Crow's Perch region... Eh, doesn't matter anymore.

I love the characters, they have grown on me. The side-quests were extremely good, mature and often funny. The story is befitting for Geralt's final story.

But the landscape, by the love of gods, were the most beautiful I have seen in a game. I was very immersed. No other game has this impact in my life. Toussaint, Skellige and Kaer Morhen were my favorite.

Witcher 3 helped me through the roughest patches of my life, back when the universe was seems to be against me. It was my escape. It really felt like I was visiting beautiful places, exploring the wilderness and raiding forgotten corners of the world. It gives me the vacation I always wanted/needed. Its world was so alive.

Even now no other game come close to it. There is a certain charm to it.

Thank you CDPR for making such a great game.

But I‚Äôve done a good bit of searching and it‚Äôs pretty tricky to find a straight answer unless I‚Äôm missing something obvious. To make my position clear, I‚Äôll start by saying I saw the Netflix show in December and in February got Witcher 3. In absolutely addicted and into the final DLC now (send help). I‚Äôve also purchase all 8 books, or more accurately, 5 books and 3 short story collections. Finding out the order of those is easy enough, I could probably list it from memory by now. The trouble is the order of the short stories within each collection isn‚Äôt  chronological? I read the first story in The Last Wish, the one with the striga. I figured it was the first one until the second chapter made references to Yen and Dandelion, and when I looked it up, apparently the order of the stories within the book is all wack. So I figured the simplest thing is to ask the internet directly with the helpful people of reddit: what is the precise order of all the books, including each short story within the collection books such as Last Wish? If anyone could outline that I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it.

Also as a side note, I‚Äôve seen something about a comic series or two? Are any of them worth getting, and if so where to they fit into the timeline? Or are they not part of the book canon? Thanks",7,1583905539,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fgsdaf/complete_book_timeline/,witcher,1

How is a series called **The Witcher** completely ignoring *The Witcher*? He was basically a nonfactor side-character last book as well...just hangs in in Toussaint, banging Fringilla, and...not much else.

There have been multiple chapters from the POV of random NPCs. But nothing from Geralt yet. Or Yenn?! This series seemed to be based around Geralt, Yenm, and Ciri, and yet the first two are non-existent so far.

Am I overreacting? Does it get better? It's honestly a slog to get through. At least Ciri's chapters are interesting, but still pretty uneventful. Okay, sorry for bitching.

By this point in the quest I'm all out of food and healing potions and can't keep moving on from my current save point. This has been my experience in all of my playthroughs.

fgaal1,TalketyTalketyTalk,"I am giving up on WItcher 2, should I even buy Witcher 3?","After really loving Witcher 1, I thought I would like to finish the entire series (especially seeing the praise that Witcher 3 receives). I didn't really resonate with me, but I tried sticking with it [after my last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/ff7069/does_witcher_2_ever_opens_up/). However, now, I am just giving up on this game.

Following is a list of problems I had with this game. Can some one who has played all the three games comment on whether Witcher 3 also have these problems? I am asking this because the changes made in 2 are obviously to take away some of the weirdness of 1 and make it more palatable to mainstream audience; given that 3 received such wide-spread acclaim, I am afraid that it might be even worse than 2 from my perspective.

1. **QTEs**: Final nail in the coffin, the reason I am giving up, couldn't win the fight with hangman even after some 15 tries.
2. **On-the-rails quest design**: The way quests and objectives are presented makes it seem very hand-holdy. Example: in the prologue, you have to run around the city to get a cutscene that shows exactly which planks to blow away using Aard, instead of observing and experimenting.
3. **""Cinematic""**: I really don't like Ubisoft-lite running-from-cutscene-to-cutscene style of gameplay.
4. **UI and Art Style**: Everything feels very busy, very confusing, very ""condensed"". Stuff (like loot for example) isn't properly telegraphed, very easy to get turned around due to confusing level design.
5. **Other AAA-isms**: For example, I find it jarring when gameplay changes to something completely different (the dragon evasion ""minigame"", for instance). Or the fact that the minimap showing you literally where you need to run to next just kills all sense of exploration (in Witcher 1, I ended up remembering the city layout. Not in this game).

So, should I even bother with Witcher 3? Is it similar to Witcher 2 when it comes to the above points?",19,1583826735,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fgaal1/i_am_giving_up_on_witcher_2_should_i_even_buy/,witcher,1

What I would like to add is, I was sorta upset at the ending. In which Ciri ""sacrifices"" herself and then Geralt finds her later in the Inn and gets her a new sword. I was upset because Emhyr failed to defeat Radovid and was later assassinated.. I was upset because I really like Emhyr's character...

I know that might sound strange to many, but I think he is awesome. There is a majesty in his voice (thanks to Charles Dance) and also in his presence, he seems intelligent and cunning and at times I felt even Geralt felt a little intimidated (I could be wrong of course). His dialogue is also great, for example when Geralt asks Emhyr if he is sure Ciri was seen/spotted and Emhyr replies ""do you think I summoned you here to discuss a rumour?"" in a very patronising manner.  Another thing I liked was the theme/soundtrack which plays every time we are in VIzimia or when we meet Emhyr. 

Back to the story, after I had finished it I learnt that there were multiple endings and also one in which Emhyr defeats Redania and lives. Apparently I failed to do one of the side quests which lead to this ending. Oh well. I plan on completing the game again so yay. 

Anyone else like Emhyr or have any interesting takes, I'm curious to hear. Thank you for reading.",17,1583808453,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fg6zjl/just_finished_the_game_and/,witcher,1

I did start to play Witcher 3 a while ago (1 or 2 years ago) but for some real-life issues had to stop playing it and now, I don't remember quite a bit or even if I remember it feels like long distant memories. (I just reached to Skellige at my gameplay at an appropriate level).

Now I was thinking maybe I should start over and checked some mods to enhance the game itself maybe?

What I was thinking is;

Witcher 3 HD Rework Project ([https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/1021](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/1021))  
Ghost Mode ( [https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/992/](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/992/) )

I've heard so much good and stuff but I don't enjoy it. I have no connection to Geralt or anyone else for that matter but I really tried to get one. I even read the books but still, no good.

The combat is meh, although fighting against humans is kind of fun. The story feels disconnected, I mostly do side missions that doesn't really make me feel anything. The crafting system feels unrewarding but I guess I still haven't come to the good parts. The only fun thing atm is Gwent. It's fun.

It just feels like a card game slap together from a bunch of other card games that don't work very well together.

I went in the order of when they were published, so the 2 short story books first and then the series. I just finished Time of Contempt and am trying to get some advice. To be totally honest, I have not enjoyed the books as much as I thought I would. There has definitely been moments i've loved (mostly badass Geralt scenes) but those moments are far and few between. I will say I really got into the last half of Time of Contempt, especially &gt;!the banquet, betrayal, and subsequent aftermath. !&lt; but the ending &gt;!with Ciri seemingly raped by that one girl bandit!&lt; made me feel sort of uncomfortable reading it. I guess I want to know if in your opinion, the later books in the series are better and maybe more reflective of the game. Should I power through because the books are worth it, or maybe just get my fix through the show?",7,1583747199,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/ffs9ma/ranking_the_books/,witcher,1

ffkrdq,Sub_an,Why don't sorcerers kill monsters?,"I'm about 68% of the way through Blood of Elves and I'm wondering how witchers can find work. It seems sorcerers are in higher numbers, significantly more powerful, knowledgeable and less hated. Why don't people higher them to kill monsters? Why don't they offer their services rather than witchers? 

I understand Sorcerers are more costly and I assume not specialised in this line of work but there must be enough willing to take up killing monsters that they could take all of witcher's traditional work. I get that work is dwindling and sparse but Geralt has still had enough work to prevent him starving to death and fill short story books. 

Moreover, why could Geralt cure the Striga and not a sorcerer?  I assume foltest could afford any powerful and knowledgeable sorcerer. I remember a lot of people attempted to help with the Striga situation surely some sorcerer or sorceress should manage to get the job done.  I've got the impression they're far superior to witchers and could kill monsters with ease. 

It's clear the witcher's work is frowned upon, taboo and even disgusts people. I don't know if that's substantial enough to prevent sorcerers from taking it up. I suppose I kind of understand and I've answered my own question but I wonder if these reasons are enough and what anyone else has to add.",9,1583708000,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/ffkrdq/why_dont_sorcerers_kill_monsters/,witcher,1

ffgksw,3rasvok,Does it get any better?,"I just finished playing the first two games and while they weren't perfect I had some fun with both of them and people kept telling me it's worth going thourgh them for W3 alone. So I'm feeling a bit let down that I'm having some trouble getting into the third one. I'm only level 6 so I can't speak for the whole game, but my issues with it so far are: 

1.The world looks great, but feels very sparse and empty. At first, I tried blindly exploring the map as I would play a Bethesda game for example, but realized it wasn't getting me anywhere. Following the white question marks didn't help either because all of them lead to a small group of enemies with barely any loot on them (or anything noteworthy about the location.)

2. The level of the enemies felt off once I got to Velen I was level 4 (almost 5) and I felt I did everything there was to White Orchard yet anywhere I went the enemies outleveled me. After going to a couple of places I realized even if managed to wipe out a fort full of monsters they weren't tough because they were guarding something valuable, but because I was too low level. I kind of felt like being punished for exploring and I read online you really just supposed to follow the main quest line which I find odd since I always thought that side quests and exploring were there so you'd be strong enough to face the main quest stuff.

3. The game seems REALLY crafting heavy will I be able to find unique armor and weapons later on? Or it's all about crafting and upgrading?

To be honest, since Witcher 1,2 reminded me a lot of old Bioware and since W3 is open world I was excepting something like Baldur's Gate 1 desgin wise, however the game mostly plays like an open world Ubisoft game with better story so far.",10,1583691784,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/ffgksw/does_it_get_any_better/,witcher,1

Now my questions are: In what order should i play the games? 1, 2, 3? Should i skip 1 because of the combat, or should i play it because it is critical for the story? How long of a play time will the games have if i play on medium with a couple of sidequests?

Thanks in advance,

So I thought, Yeah, Triss sounds fine, plus she is a redhead, always a plus.

But then I read into the backstory, and it seemed like Triss tricked, betrayed, and exploited both Geralt and Ciri at every turn. Now I am trying to go for her, because I do not particularly like Yennefer, but I am having a hard time figuring out why I have yet to crucify her.

ffbsj2,DagonParty,What interesting side quests/contracts fail from Main Quest progression?,"Hello, I‚Äôve played this game since it‚Äôs release and to this day have never completed everything.

What interesting things are missable? I always do the Kiera Mitz and the Skellige political intrigue quests before they can fail, but I sorta count them as Main Quests due to their nature. But there‚Äôs definitely interesting things I‚Äôve missed. For example, the Master Vampire I‚Äôve seen once in a trailer, where he tells you to fuck off after asking what year it is.

I‚Äôm not too bothered about missing something generic, like a boss Water Hag contract for example

I know there‚Äôs lists out there of EVERY quest that is missable and alot of those I probably won‚Äôt care about going out of my way for.

Also I‚Äôm not great with remembering names of quests I‚Äôve done since 2015 and I don‚Äôt want to read into the quests as I don‚Äôt want them to be spoiled. So it‚Äôs rather difficult to find these things, as I imagine a few are connected between several quests that need to be done first.

ff8rzh,sank666,An observation and question about the Netflix Witcher show," 

Hello people. Any mediaval history buffs here ? I solicit your help in order to figure out something, please.

In the Netflix show. What is Henry Cavill's wearing exactly (is main costume/armor) ? Is it a brigandine (coat of plates) ? Is so, how does he take it off (in character) ? Acording to the books, it's supposed to be a black leather jacket with silver studs (especially on the gloves). But this costume ? It looks it can only laced/unlaced from the back. Normally, for this king of garment, the wearer needs an extra pair of hands to help him wearing and adjusting it. 

In the character's case and context, especially if he's a lone wolf, that makes no sens at all. It would require straps on front for him to wear this piece alone without help.

What do you people think ?

ff2y2g,DroP90,I can‚Äôt play Witcher 3 anymore,"I can‚Äôt play this game anymore.

I really wanted to make a NG+ run and fix some of my bad decisions on my first playthrough but I simple can‚Äôt, and don‚Äôt get me wrong, The Witcher 3 is one of the best games I have ever played, a truly masterpiece, but there is some sentimental things attached to this game that I think I couldn‚Äôt overcome.

I pre-ordered the game, the only one so far, and started playing on launch May 2015, took my time with it and spent months playing to get all things done, bought the expansions and played through them in 2016, 10/10. Now the reason I can‚Äôt play again is because of this period of my life, I was on a relationship with the girl that I thought it would be the one, it lasted from 2012 through 2017 and I made the decision of breaking up with her because we had some really deep differences in religious and spiritual matters, even with these differences we had a beautiful time together, never arguing or fighting, zero problems with trusting and supporting each other, but in the end we couldn‚Äôt work the differences. After this I spent some months on the single life and thought everything was fine, until I realized that I still loved her and decided to ask for a new chance, too late, she was going to Belgium and there was nothing I could do about it. In Belgium she met another guy and  after some months got engaged, I couldn‚Äôt believe since I had hopes that she could come back, 2018 was the worst year of my life, living days with deep sorrow and regrets, decaying spiral of depression, but then comes 2019 and she breaks with this guy and goes to Portugal to live with a cousin, with help of her mother we started to talk again and doing plans to be together, I was ready to move to Europe and be with her in Portugal if she didn‚Äôt wanted to come back to Brazil, but after 2 months she started to change her mind about all of this and after some weeks I realized I had lost her, needless to say I wanted to kill myself and only got a hold because I had some great people around giving me strength. Sometime after this I got in love with another girl and this kind of healed me, and I made a really great trip through Europe and saw how I still had many great things to live.

Now, what this have to do with not being able to play Witcher 3 again? Last year after judging I was healed, I tried to replay it and couldn‚Äôt go past the intro scenario since the memories with her would kick in, when I played in 2015/16 it would always be on weekends when she was with me, sometimes she would watch me play since she knew how much I loved the game. I uninstalled and realized that I needed more time, now I tried again and sadly I couldn‚Äôt, I loaded my last save in Toussaint and as soon as I started to listen to the soundtrack while walking around the vineyards, memories kicked in. And I‚Äôm saying this because I was sure I was healed, I‚Äôm in a new relationship with the girl that I got in love last year and we are very happy together for almost 6 months now, I think of my ex with fondness and affection but I don‚Äôt love her anymore, still I can‚Äôt play this game because it remembers of great times with her that I know are completely buried in the past.

I know probably no one will read this wall of text but I really wanted to share, I think this game is the evidence of how games can connect with periods of our life and have a profound meaning on everything that we lived on that period. Idk, maybe it‚Äôs the melancholic soundtrack, maybe it‚Äôs the sentimental vibes of the scenery, but sadly I can‚Äôt play this game anymore. Really wanted to make things right with Ciri and Yen.

ff0atw,alexd2040,I deleted a mod and now have lvl 100 weapon on fresh start,"So I previously had a mod downloaded for the Witcher 3, I decided I did not like it and removed it.   
And reinstalled it, it seemed the mod was still there, once more deleted it and this time also deleted the mod map in my folder and upon reinstalling I saw it deleted the mod, I started a fresh character and it seems everything was fine.   


However I have level 100 gear, 700 damage swords and I have around 5500 health.   
I understand this is not normal but I have not played in over a year and was wondering if I could use these weapons to rush through the game up to the point I was at one year ago.   
(It seems I do insane damage, 4 used for the griffon)   


But once I progress up the point of where I was before, I do not want to be stuck with a unfair amount of health, is this 5500 the normal health for a lvl 1 character and if it is not is there any way I can change it to the correct values after I discard the weapons.

I don't mind restarting, because it's a fun game. However I don't have a lot of time to game, so being able to pick up where I left off would be cool.

feqnjs,Okhummyeah,Hmmm so i have been spoiled about the ending and i have some questions.,"By the way im still listening to the sword of destiny audiobook but now im reluctant to continue.
‚óè so i heard that geralt and yenefer both dies :( in a mob ? Seriously how racist can the humans be smh...but what i dont like is that (from whati heard) the author is ambiguous towards their death? 
Which is something i hate to be honest. If you are killing off main characters at least be straight about it. 
And also i love when there is a proper reason behind characters death. A beautiful message or a beautiful sacrifice that will make me cry. But from what iheard geralt just dies in a mob? Thats lame...
‚óè im reluctant to read the witcher books now, i heard they die midway in the books or something? Then ciri becomes the mc? 
‚óè anyway as i said i dont have a problem with characyers dying (ive read mistborn) but it has to serve a purpose. So what was the message behind their death? Was the author trying to convey something to you the readers?

fei3ew,wizardpaninis,Book Rankings and Lady of the Lake Questions,"I've finished the Witcher series - it was awesome! Although I still have Season of Storms left to read (I'll come back to it when I'm craving more Witcher stuff!). 

**My book rankings:**

1. The Tower of the Swallow
2. Time of Contempt
3. The Sword of Destiny
4. Lady of the Lake
5. Baptism of Fire
6. The Last Wish
7. Blood of Elves

Let me know your rankings!

**Questions:**

* There is a lot of reference to ""the white frost"" and Ciri setting alight the world, then we didn't see that occur. Same goes for the Wild Hunt / Naglfar. Are we meant to think that is going to happen in Ciri's future (after the books), or did I miss the significance?
* They (Geralt, Yen and Ciri) all end up in Avalon (King Arthur's world), does this mean they died? I assume that the healing attempt failed and Yen sees Tissaia (who is very dead), and they drift off in a spectral boat (like ghosts/spirits). I liked this ending but some of what Ciri says at the ending confused me. Sapkowski often tells events in non-chronological order and I only realised at the end that Ciri's conversation with Galahad came after the rest of it all. How did Ciri get to this other place (through the fog?) did she die too? And how does she also know about Yen and Geralt getting married, etc.? (Also gutted that we didn't get to see the wedding!) I think I'm really mixed up!
* When Geralt and Yen are reunited and Vligefortz defeated Geralt lies to Yen about having slept with anyone else, and she fully believes him. Did anyone else think this is kind of sad?
* I didn't fully understand the significance of Nimue and the oneiromancer. Was it simply a story-telling device? 
* Has Sapkowski ruled out writing any more about Geralt/Ciri and the crew? 
* Anyone who has played the games after reading the books, is it even better than without?",16,1583520552,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fei3ew/book_rankings_and_lady_of_the_lake_questions/,witcher,1
fehyj8,Incindir,Just got done bingeing The Witcher on Netflix. (I only have one complaint),"I've played the games, haven't read the books. There are some inconsistencies that I wish they would correct in the show, but overall, I really like it.

I realize that they took some artistic liberties with some of the characters, like Triss, but the actress playing her sounds very much like the character in the games.

One hangup I had initially was that Geralts eyes are supposed to be catlike, but then I observed that if you make a contact lens that looks like a cat eye, it will just swivel around and not stay vertically aligned. This would end up with Geralt having some epic level derpy eyes and be a major bitch for Mr. Cavill if they had to keep adjusting his contact lenses every 20 seconds. (Which begs the question, why don't they make contact lenses that are the green screen color and CGI in the cat slit pupils? Too expensive?)

The actress playing Yennifer(sp) is a dead ringer for the one in game. Great actress. Fantastic casting choice.

My only complaint. And really my only one. Is his medallion. They need to fix his damned medallion because it's not right. They shell out for some VERY well made arms and armor in the show, but go cheap on the Wolf medallion? Come on Netflix. With a second season coming can we get that changed? There has got to be someone out there that can make an accurate reproduction.",17,1583520021,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fehyj8/just_got_done_bingeing_the_witcher_on_netflix_i/,witcher,1

fefw5f,JaydSky,How powerful is Geralt compared to other witchers?,"In The Witcher 3, Geralt will be at one time chasing down Nekkers for peasants, and at other times dueling the King of the Wild Hunt or an ancient higher vampire and winning. This is one of my favourite contrasts in the game. Geralt feels like a real person - a tradesman getting by - but also a fighter with skill not short of legendary. This balance between tradesman and legend can't be easy to pull off as a storyteller, but it works beautifully here.

Presumably all witchers have the tradesman part down, but not all are legends (or powerful enough to be legendary). This difference could have been explored better in the game. At the battle of Kaer Morhen you got a sense of the competence of the other witchers, but I'm not entirely sure what I would expect from, say, Eskel dueling Eredin or Dettlaff. Geralt tells Ciri he's a stronger fighter than she is when they are going after Imlerith, even as he trusts her to solo all three Crones at once. Surely that's not generally true of experienced witchers, right? Imlerith had just killed Vesemir (who was old, yes, but still).

Is this something that is explored more in the books? (I've only read a couple.)",16,1583511997,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fefw5f/how_powerful_is_geralt_compared_to_other_witchers/,witcher,1

fedumn,ScriptGenius12,Towerful of Mice brilliance,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-I doubt all of Alexander's human test subjects were volunteers. Sudddenly that peasant revolt and assault on the tower may have another motive.

\-It seems kinda odd in retrospect that the peasants assaulting the tower died after they apparently were victorious in taking it and killing everyone there. Also seems a bit odd that a competent mage like Alexander could be killed by peasants. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then one realizes what happened to Ana. This is likely what happened: Peasants storm tower, kill guards and her dad. Ana dies, and becomes a Pesta, kills the peasants in revenge. Graham, guilty over getting her to open the door, has already left and is not present when she first rises. 

&amp;#x200B;

Alexander was likely killed by her too. Irony at its finest.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Anyways I got the bad ending and accidentally unleashed Ana on the world because I'm a sucker for romance stories involving monsters. I won't go back to an earlier save, I'm playing a man who lives with his mistakes.",6,1583503232,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fedumn/towerful_of_mice_brilliance/,witcher,1
fedom9,ScriptGenius12,How do you play Geralt in WH?,"&amp;#x200B;

For me: 

\-Being Ciri's dad has lead to Geralt being more merciful. I talk down monsters and people if given the opportunity to prevent bloodshed. I use Axii, but only if violence is about to occur on the spot in order to defuse it. After accidentally releasing a Pesta onto the mainland when I thought that I was freeing her, I tend to be far more cautious when dealing with Cursed Ones. I now check absolutely everything with Witcher senses.

\-I have a soft spot for woman and children. If they get hurt I give the one responsible Hell, human or monsters. I let a contract giver keep the reward so that an obviously traumatized child could have it, but after some very trying events at Velen I won't be doing that as often.

\-I'm serious about getting paid. When a guy didn't pay me the amount we agreed on after I killed a powerful Foglet, I got pissed and made him hand it over right then and there.

My question:

Has anyone else noticed how the stories of the main saga and TW3 are very similar? It doesn't bother me but it is noticeable if you've read the books, to me at least. 
In both:

You're searching for Ciri.

The Wild Hunt and Emhyr are after Ciri.

Ciri, in her travels meets with a band of elves and outsiders, though in the game they're not bandits.

After you find Ciri she takes you on a tour to thank/apologize/get revenge on people from her journey. 

Yen takes Ciri to meet with The Lodge, she leaves with a promise to return but does not because of unforeseen events.

Here‚Äôs my problem:

I keep hearing/watching/reading that the alchemy/decoction build is the way to go, and that the toxicity effects last as long as the decoctions last. 

Is that BS? Regardless, what I‚Äôm going thru is BS. 

My decoctions‚Äô toxicity level ‚Äî and the decoctions have 73-minute durations ‚Äî have been expiring in under 3 minutes, with 96% of the decoction duration left to go!

I turned down the difficulty from Dark, continued my playthrough. I encountered even bigger bullshit, took a few days break. Got me thinking, from what i can remember in my salty haze. I did the most damage with bombs as last result attack before i die. When i defeated him on easier mode, they gave me bombs and daggers afterwards. So i reloaded earlier save on Dark difficulty and made shit ton of grapeshots. Guess what ? Less than a dozen hits with them and is a easy gg win. Rendering most of your equipment useless. You don't need swords, armor (you have queen), pots, oils or anything of the sorts. If you have grinded for the Blasphemous set, tough way bucko! Thankfully i didn't.
Another ""fun"" cheesy tactic i dyscovered is using Axii, it will stun him and allow you to go in for 1/2 hits.
The fight is piss easy, just bullshit and gimmicky like the last boss fight. No skills required whatsoever. There is no gameplay, just a test to prove how good you are at bullshittery.

-I have some Hearts of Stone marked sidequests in my quest list. Are they connected to the HoS main Story and is it a bad Idea to play them before I start with the HoS main story?

-Which DLC do you prefer?",5,1583395792,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fds560/some_questions_abou_the_witcher_3_dlcs/,witcher,1
fdrvnn,Rustedinpeace,Fan Fiction Sequel (Sword of Destiny Spoilers),"If you need, be a brutal as Geralt on this. Fan fiction usually isn‚Äôt my thing but I wrote this in about an hour right after fishing A Little Sacrifice. Enjoy, hate it, whatever.





&gt;! ‚ÄùAn Overdue Goodbye‚Äù

Geralt trodged up the wet grass of the hill, the heavy storm soaking him to the bone. He stepped over a large rock, gaining more and more ground toward the tree above him at the top.

Trying to shield his eyes from the pelting rain with his hand, he thought about what Dandelion told him; how Little Eye died of a smallpox outbreak. How Dandelion, painstakingly and filled with sorrow, had to pilfer Essi‚Äôs body from a pile of burning corpses in the night, a woman that amounted in his mind to his little sister. And how Dandelion had buried her at the most beautiful view he knew of in the forests just outside of Vizima.

The Witcher‚Äôs footsteps felt heavier to him than they should, seemingly sinking into the wet earth an extra inch due to an invisible weight Geralt was carrying. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what it feels like at least...‚Äù he mumbled to himself.

Geralt tried to avert his eyes from the ancient tree at the top of the hill as long as he could, but eventually with it being the massive and singular item in his perspective, this became futile. As his boots, muddy and dripping with aggressively falling rain, approached the outermost of the tree‚Äôs above ground roots, Geralt slowed. 

He thought to himself that he both wanted to be at his final destination as quickly as possible, and at the same time, he wished that the trip had taken a much, much longer time. Geralt stopped at the stone lying in front of the old tree‚Äôs trunk, the stone Dandelion had carved and placed on top of Little Eye‚Äôs final resting place.

‚ÄúResting place...‚Äù Geralt spat out in his head, ‚Äú...you didn‚Äôt get the rest you deserved. You passed in so much pain, and I can only imagine your terrible fear and hopelessness. Oh, how I could have seen you one last time then, comforted you, let you know that while I may not have been destined for you, that pearl meant as much to me as it did to you...‚Äù

Geralt thought about that beautiful, near perfect, sky blue pearl. How it sat perfectly in the magnificent flower necklace Essi had made for it. He thought about when Dandelion tried to lie and say that Geralt remembered her birthday and got her that muck covered shell - all the while no one knowing such a beautiful gem was held inside.

Looking at the stone on the ground, water continuing to interfere with his vision as it kept running down his soaking white hair into his eyes, he could see the engraving had been worn down by age some, but it wasn‚Äôt near illegible yet.

‚ÄúWith great beauty and fierce heart, ‚Äòtis with tragedy this pearl and world must part.‚Äù Geralt read aloud part of the engraving Dandelion left on the stone. He continued, ‚ÄúEssi Da-‚Äú the Witcher choked before being able to finish her name.

He blamed it on the weather. The storm. It made him feel tense, and ill. Too much magic in the air during these damned storms. Geralt swallowed hard and hardened his face to finish, ‚ÄúEssi Daven.‚Äù He reached into his sodden cloak and grabbed a small bouquet of flowers.

‚ÄúThis is stupid,‚Äù the Witcher said aloud, to no one. Not a person, let alone he, knew what happened after people died. Geralt understood that if they had bad luck or some unfinished business they could come back as monsters. He knew that because that was his charge, his trade. But no one, even the priests of the Eternal Flame claiming otherwise, really knew what happened when someone died and left for good. Not even the forbidden practice of necromancy had been able to answer that question.

Geralt shook his head. Philosophizing wasn‚Äôt why he was here, nor his strong suit, and he knew it. He was trying to shield himself from any emotion, and yet he came here to deal with emotion, not avoid it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean THIS is stupid just... well. We may not have shared many days together but daft is the last thing I‚Äôd call you. You blessed me by showing so much of your true self, and If anyone is daft it‚Äôs me, because...‚Äù thunder rumbled interrupting Geralt‚Äôs speech to the stone - which he considered a good thing because he had just choked up again, though he wouldn‚Äôt have admitted it to anyone. The Witcher was grateful he decided to make this journey alone. Geralt took a deep breath.

‚ÄúEssi I wronged you. You offered love and I offered... well, all I ever offer. Pain. I always, always wish it could be different. And especially for you. Your tongue and wit were as beautiful as your eyes, and I wish I‚Äôd seen you again after that day long ago, at least once more. Just to say you were important to me, despite our meager length of time together.‚Äù Geralt paused, looking down and away from the stone. He stood for a few minutes in silence listening to the plop-plop-plop of water hitting saturated soil.

 If it weren‚Äôt raining, would his cheeks nevertheless be wet? Doubtful. But that didn‚Äôt mean anything other than he was what he was, a Witcher. It didn‚Äôt mean he wasn‚Äôt being earnest in what he was saying - earnest in what he was thinking. Truth was the only thing he could offer the deceased girl.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been very lucky in my life. I‚Äôve survived so many wounds that would have killed countless other men that... well, I‚Äôve lost count. I‚Äôve escaped from enraged Kings wanting my head, sorcerers wanting my power, and humans wanting to vivisect me just to see a monster suffer and satisfy their morbid curiosity... And I‚Äôve been nothing but a complete whoreson during my life. There‚Äôs no justice in the world where I‚Äôm alive and you are not. I kill monsters for coin. You gave people both respite from and strength to tackle their own monsters...‚Äù Geralt contentiously shook his head, causing many drops to fall from his long white locks.

The Witcher knelt down on one knee, the rain not relenting. He placed the small bouquet next to the stone marking Essi‚Äôs burial spot. Then he stood slowly, closing his eyes, wishing the rain to wash this confusion, regret, and loss away. It did not. Geralt sighed and opened his eyes.

‚ÄúGoodbye Essi. Wherever you are, I do hope it‚Äôs as beautiful as your songs, ‚Äòcause nothing could be as beautiful as your heart.‚Äù Geralt nodded and turned away from the stone, making his way back down the hill.!&lt;",1,1583394032,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fdrvnn/fan_fiction_sequel_sword_of_destiny_spoilers/,witcher,1

fdqd04,arachnid5,Decision In BaW,"So I just got done playing the Blood and Wine expansion and well, F\*ck.

In the end I chose to help the two sisters make amends and kill detlof. Now I was at first on the fence about Detloff from what Regis told me he seemed like a good fellow, but his actions throught the expansion really had me iffy. But what sealed it was when he called a horde of vampires down on the city. I know it was a lovers spat but this was just to far. Regis may have said he was good but detloff made no effort in showing that to me, and so I chose to kill him. When I saw Regis finsih him off I felt odd. On one hand I felt good, I had one I beat the beast. But on the other hand the way Regis apologizes to Detloff before killing him kinda hurt me, I felt heavy like I had done good, but at what cost. Then came the part where we see the sisters reunite and it is a genuinely sweet moment, but it gets muddled when Regis is forced to leave. 

I knew this would happen, I looked up a guide for the quest before hand and knew that he would be forced to leave, and yet experiencing it in game, it hurt me.

I got to thinking, his kind will now hate him for what he has done. They all took an oath to never fight each other, and yet Regis broke that century long oath. It showed that he truly cared for us and that he was a great friend. But now his own kind will shun him he will be separated from his people. Yes he mentions that in nilfgaard no one believes in vampires, so he can still make friends, it is still sad that his own people will never truly look at him the same. This quest felt the most like the withcer to me, there really was no fairytale happy ending. They were all kind of bad and good in their own ways.

fdjylv,Raf_von_Thorn,A simple guide to Aerondight and why its the best silver sword in Witcher 3,"Out of many swords in the game, this is the single most powerful and useful silver one you can obtain. If you dont have it, havent heard about it, or struggle to get it, this guide is for you.

**What stats does the sword have and what makes it special.**

Ingame descrition: *Each blow generates charges which increase sword damage by 10%. Charges are lost over time or when receiving damage. A fully-charged sword always deals critical hit damage. Killing a monster with a fully loaded sword will expend its charge to permanently increase the weapon's damage. Damage is increased by: 0 (to a maximum of 10 - increasing along with your character level).*

Yes, the damage output is increasing by 10 every time you level up. So, if you get the sword at level 47, its stats are 522-638. If you are level 67 (and use the sword to kill monsters while its fully loaded), the stats are 722-838! Its easy to count, that the max damage is 1000 at level 87!

But thats just the basic damage. With every hit you land, the damage is increasing another 10%, up to maximum 100% bonus AND then every hit is a critical hit, so the basic damage is **quadrupled**! No other sword can equal that... If you combine it with ""bloodbath"" mutation, you can land **10000** hits at level 87...

When you get it, you can sell all the other silver swords, really.

**How to obtain the sword the earliest**

Aerondight can only be gained by completing the quest There Can Be Only One in *Blood and Wine* expansion in Toussaint.

Its a complicated quest and requires completing 5 other quests in a manner to prove you posses each of the five chivalric virtues of Toussaint. Here is the way to get it with minimum effort. I did it at level 33 of first game and level 67 of ng+, doing the following quests. You can do other tasks, but I will describe those I have chosen in my deathmarch ng+, as the least complicated and earliest available ones.

1. When you get to Toussaint, go to the small lake called Lac C√©lavy northwest of Beauclair- its easy to find on the map; its the only lake with a small island (with another small pond on it) in its middle. Talk to the druid, it will start the *There Can Be Only One* quest.

2. Prove valor: I have chosen to complete *Feet as Cold as Ice*. In Beauclair, on a small square next to Nilfgaardian Embassy talk to the exclamation mark lady, which wants you to find her fiancee, alternatively look for Francois between Beauclair and the Lac C√©lavy  lake. Then you have to kill the Grottore (one of the most powefrul Leshen in the game) while keeping Francois alive. Let me tell you, its a hell of a challenge with a relatively low level Geralt on deathmarch. I tried it maybe 15 times before I succeeded. The key is the golden oriole potion, as it makes you invulnerable to the Leshens plant ""minion"". Its doable. 

3. Prove honor: go to the Clever Clogs Tavern in Beauclair (its close to the cemetery and find an exclamation mark bloke on the first floor. Talk to him, accept the Till Death Do You Part quest and complete it. Its pretty straightforward and requires no fighting (if you chose to move the nagging bitch urn).

4. Prove compassion, generosity AND wisdom: its a tricky one, as it requires you to follow the main quest ""The Beast of Toussaint"" and to get to the point you need you have to defeat the Bruxa in Corvo Bianco, which is a very hard fight. Fortunatelly black blood potion and moon dust bomb make it much easier. DO NOT go to the fight without moon dust bomb! After you kill the Bruxa, follow the quest line and defeat the Shaelmaar on the arena. SPARE ITS LIFE to complete the compassion part. Then go with Anna Henrietta and attempt to find Milton. After gathering the clues, GUESS THAT THE LOCATION OF NEXT MURDER IS A GREENHOUSE to complete the wisdom part. You will start the ""Blood run"" quest- fight Dettlaff- it doesnt matter if you win or lose. THEN go to the main Beauclair square: a boy messenger will deliver a letter to you. TIP HIM 5 COINS to complete the generosity part.

5. Return to Lac C√©lavy lake and fight the druid. Its a tought fight, be prepared to lose a lot on deathmarch. One tip: control the space and as soon as you see druid turning into the tornado, stay away. Once you win the fight, the best sword in the game is yours!

**Important note**

As it is very good to get the sword as early as possible, the damage stats are the same, no matter at which level you acquire it. In my ng+ I went for the second Aerondight very early. Imagine my disapointment when after VERY hard completion of the quests (especially the valor one and the monk fight) I received the second sword and it turned out that both swords have **exactly the same stats**! Altough its nice to have two of Aerondights; first you can mount different upgrades on each one (I got 15% freeze on one and 15% bleeding on the second) and also there seems to be a glitch: every monster kill when at 10 charges gives you 2 points of damage improvement instead of one.

I hope this humble guide makes the Aerondight nature a bit clearer and obtaining it less chaotic for at least some of you. Now I gotta go, it looks like rain.

fdj1ll,WeWearAMaskThatLies,YSK that you can get your Witcher gear upgraded to Grandmaster for FREE if you bring the diagrams to Lazare while having the superior gear in your inventory in the Masterx4 quest,"Saw a post today about having to grind to obtain all the grandmaster Witcher gear sets and coincidentally found this out yesterday. 

So I found all the diagrams for the grandmaster feline set and went to go turn them in to the smith to complete the master master quest. However, before upgrading anything, I noticed that my superior feline silver sword, which had been in my inventory when I turned the diagrams in, was already upgraded to grandmaster! 

Of course, being a cheap bastard, I wanted to see if this would work for the whole set so I reloaded a save before the quest was completed, added all my feline gear (which was already upgraded to superior) from my stash to my inventory, then went to Lazare to turn in the diagrams. Lo and behold, I checked and they were all upgraded to grandmaster! My coin and crafting materials were untouched. 

Anyways, just hope this helps someone who is trying to get all the grandmaster gear. Your gear must be upgraded to superior and in your inventory when you turn the diagrams in for this to work. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this would work for multiple sets/diagrams. However, you do save coin/materials on at least one set. I didn‚Äôt try because I only had my feline armor upgraded to superior beforehand but maybe someone else can test it out and let us know!",5,1583353226,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fdj1ll/ysk_that_you_can_get_your_witcher_gear_upgraded/,witcher,1

fde6fr,Robyn_Storyteller,The Witcher TV Show: An Outsider‚Äôs Perspective,"Hey everybody!

I thought it might be interesting for me to chip in my two cents worth about the Netflix show. I came to it completely cold. I‚Äôve never read the books, nor played any of the games. Obviously I‚Äôm not right or wrong about anything, but just thought I‚Äôd offer the opinion of a complete outsider.

It‚Äôs a good but very confusing show - The three different plot lines and three different timelines made it a difficult show to follow. There‚Äôs also not a whole lot of explanation about what stuff is and what‚Äôs going on. You‚Äôre just kind of thrown into the middle of it. I actually didn‚Äôt mind it that much. As a huge fan of other properties, I think that shows like this should be made for the people who are already fans of the universe. So it didn‚Äôt bother me that it took me a while to come up to speed.

It‚Äôs a better show on rewatch - But with all the confusion going on in the show, I found that it was a much better show the second time through. Rewatching it, I understood much more and enjoyed it much more.

Although parts of it do drag - There was no part of the show that I felt was a drag the first time through. But rewatching it, there were some parts that felt like they were starting to drag. Some of Yennefer‚Äôs early training at Aretuza and Ciri in the Brokilon Forest were kind of bland the second time through. I thought every scene with Geralt held up really well for multiple viewings though.

Renfri was awesome - I really liked the character, the actress was awesome, and she and Geralt seemed to have great chemistry together. Honestly, I liked her more than Yennefer, and I really wish she had been in more than just the one episode.

I don‚Äôt really understand Geralt and Yennefer getting together - Geralt at his core wants to help people. Yennefer at her core wants power. I don‚Äôt really understand how the two of them can get together because they seem like very different people. Geralt using his third wish with the Jinn to save Yen‚Äôs life I totally get. Them having sex afterwards I totally get. But Geralt using his third wish to somehow magically tie them together - a woman he‚Äôs known for less than a day - just didn‚Äôt make any sense to me.

More needed to be shown of Yennefer‚Äôs 30 years - We last see Yen in Aretuza, then cut to her 30 years later when she‚Äôs become disenchanted with court life. While the change in her opinions makes sense, it would have been nice to have that shown on screen. Maybe a single episode that shows her getting disillusioned with cleaning up messes at court.

Nilfgaard is boring - I‚Äôve seen Game of Thrones and I‚Äôve seen Lord of the Rings and honestly I‚Äôm kind of over the big battle scenes and evil empires trying to take over everything. It feels like it‚Äôs been done before.

The monoliths were cool - Don‚Äôt know what they are, but they seem like they‚Äôre important given that they were in multiple shots and people are studying them now.

Henry Cavil is awesome - I know a lot of people apparently had concerns about him playing the part. Again, as I‚Äôve never read the books or played the games, I didn‚Äôt have any sort of pre-conceived notion about the character. But I really enjoyed his portrayal of Geralt and really enjoyed watching him. He was easily the best character on the show.

Overall I really enjoyed the series. I know dedicated book and game lovers were really looking forward to it, so I thought I‚Äôd just chip in with the opinion of a complete newbie.",12,1583333994,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fde6fr/the_witcher_tv_show_an_outsiders_perspective/,witcher,1

Technical limitations be damned - I love this game! I love Geralt, Roach, the shoe shine kid in Beauclair, Regis, Yen‚Ä¶ but most of all the hundreds of minor characters that make each region so rich. I've never experienced such a believable game world and rarely felt as empty when I finished the final expansion. 

The writing is what really elevates this game for me and the generosity (or long hours of overtime) of the developers is apparent throughout. What I really value in games is the experiences they deliver and the Witcher 3 is right up there with Ocarina of Time, Dark Souls and Breath of the Wild for me. A true masterpiece.

That's all - just wanted to fawn a little :)",3,1583314597,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fdant3/fawning_over_the_witcher_3/,witcher,1

Should I finish the story first, then do the DLC or should I start it as soon as its level appropriate? Which should be pretty soon for me.

Also on a side note I forgot how amazing and genuine it felt getting blasted drunk with Lambert and Eskel. That was a really well done, well voiced mission. ""you had to kneel down to see that geralt?"" ""if I bent over, I would have puked!""..

fd773f,Ultragamershiko,Something I noticed about the vitality in this book.,"WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD

So I‚Äôm on page 130 of the book and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm misreading or anything, but people die so easily when Geralt cuts them.

I just read the Shrike encounter and one cut on the hip and groin leaves her moaning in agony before she dies. Like I‚Äôd figure that would get her to stop since Geralt didn‚Äôt want to kill her since the regions he slashed had no vital areas.

It went simarly for when he fought off her cronies. I felt like a lot of those cuts could‚Äôve been walked off since. most of them were on the tendons or the shoulder.

Am I misreading something or is Geralt‚Äôs sword tainted with some sort of poison. I could understand silver having that impact on a monster, but I wouldn‚Äôt think steel would be a death sentece when cut by it to humans",20,1583293996,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fd773f/something_i_noticed_about_the_vitality_in_this/,witcher,1
fd6y3i,DoubleDThrowaway94,Geralt‚Äôs Stage of Life,"After watching the tv show, playing the third game, and started reading the books I haven‚Äôt been able to determine is Geralt‚Äôs life stage. 

We know he‚Äôs around 100 years old, but we also know he ages slowly. Being around 80ish? In the show, he seems more like a man who would be 30 - 45 years in a humans life. But in the games he seems much closer to a late 50s, early 60s human. I know the games are not cannon, and take place after the books, but it‚Äôs it a far enough time for him to have changed like that?",10,1583292819,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fd6y3i/geralts_stage_of_life/,witcher,1

Just because I‚Äôm really torn between Yen and Triss, I can‚Äôt proceed. I haven‚Äôt done either‚Äôs romance quest. Once I tried to do The Last Wish first and just can‚Äôt. I just quitted the game.

I have a bunch of fun with my sign build but didn't know if Cat could be just as fun.

Would it be easier with a Cat build instead of Griffon or is that just part if the game? Them being stronger I mean. Thanks!",17,1583290696,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fd6hg2/griffon_or_cat_build/,witcher,1

Certainly Kaer Mohern is known to be as the winter hideout of Witchers, how is it possible that Rience did not consider going there to look for the girl.

 Triss definitely loves Geralt but it‚Äôs more like I‚Äôll help you but there sure is a limit of the risk I‚Äôm willing to take which maybe inherent. 

Conclusion: As everyone says Yen and Geralt are soul mates, Yen will do everything in power to save Geralt.

fcxba6,123RoastHim,I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs taken me this long to play what could be one of my favorites games of all time,"Wall of text incoming and spoilers for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, obviously. 

I bought wild hunt when it was the Xbox free game of the month like 3 years ago. Started it, played around an hour, then stopped and uninstalled it. I watched the first season of the Netflix show and decided to give it another shot. 

First of all, thank god for the Netflix show. Without it I doubt I ever would have reinstalled the game. After three weeks of play (maybe 30 total hours?) I‚Äôm in Novigrad helping Triss and completing every side quest I get first if the level requirement isn‚Äôt too high for me to handle. The monster progression is really well done. I‚Äôm surprised I have played it for this long and am still being surprised with new monsters, and even when the monsters are the same as before they‚Äôre usually new locations to fight them in or have different motivations for the contract or quest. And on that note, I am getting REALLY invested in the backstories they have for these Witcher contracts. So many of them are just downright sad and I feel bad killing them most of the time given the circumstances. 

And speaking of feeling bad, I can‚Äôt count how many games I‚Äôve played that give you ‚Äúchoices that affect your path‚Äù but then either never follow through on it or the change in outcome is so small it doesn‚Äôt really matter at all (looking at you bioshock). With the Bloody Baron questline, I thought I was doing the right thing saving those kids from that weird orphan farm. I knew the woman would get in trouble but I didn‚Äôt give a shit because she was a dick to me. If I had known she would end up being the Barons wife who got screwed out of a deal she made for servitude I probably would have made a different choice earlier. And then top it all off with the Baron telling me my reward was back at the castle to find he had hanged himself...and the reward underneath was his daughters doll. Just brutal. I had no words for that. 

I didn‚Äôt even talk about how well done the weapon/armor/sign progression is with the quests the game throws at you. It‚Äôs all so unbelievably well designed I‚Äôm honestly in disbelief I haven‚Äôt found anything to dislike yet or something that just confuses me. 

And at the end of the day the game is all I can think about. I‚Äôm at work right now thinking about whether or not I want to go to Triss first or if I want to go hunt down Junior instead. Or go rescue dandelion. It‚Äôs amazing. 

Sorry I just wanted to share all of this with you. The thought of me never playing this game at all is upsetting. I almost never would have known how much I would love it.",4,1583253749,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fcxba6/i_cant_believe_its_taken_me_this_long_to_play/,witcher,1

In the end of Tha Last Wish Geralt and Yennefer were at a beggining of something. 

But at the start of Swords of Destiny when they meet for the first time (supposedly four years after) yennefer is angry at Geralt. Why?

I have playes the 3rd withcer game and now recently started reading the books. Read the last wish and now I am on Swords of destiny. (I know that somewhere in the story Geralt goes out with Triss.) But does it happen between the books? If not.. Does it happen or is explained in other books down the line?
And what was the last Geralts wish actually?


All I want is maybe for someone to tell me if this is explained somewhere else in the books

If not can someone fill me in ? (If possible without sloilers)

fclxq0,WordsonBooks1,"Finally Finished all Witcher content, glad its over","Finally finished all the books after playing the Games and having seen season 1 of the show. 

I really enjoyed the games, especially Witcher 3 and its expansions. I enjoyed the visuals of the show despite its pretty obvious short comings. I absolutely hated the books, especially anything with Geralt and Yennefer, or Ciri post Thanedd. 

The games did a fantastic job of giving consequences to your choices, even small side quests had interesting twists that made you choose between consequences that would show themselves if you went back at a later time. The characters had quite a bit of depth despite the limited dialogue options. I think this is more a characteristic of CDPR's abilities and not Sapkowski's.

The Show has potential which they've already wasted a portion of, they have the budget and cast to make a great show, kind of a condensed version of the book stories. However they are shredding too much content and losing the few interesting things the books had to offer. The Dragon Hunt was actually interesting and had many sides to the ordeal, the show version was very linear and 2dimensional. Meanwhile Yennefer's backstory was so much more interesting in the show than the few sentences in the books. I'll probably come back to it once the entire series is done in a decade.

The Books have been the biggest disappointment to me in many years. I binged through them in a few weeks, though pretty much everything after Thanedd felt like a slog. I was expecting a good well written series. Instead it is one of the worst written series I've had the misfortune to complete in over a decade. I prefer even the more amateurish written fantasy series out there, because atleast the ones that come to mind, that I know have flaws, had characters that felt human. The Characters in the Witcher never once felt human to me. The Books are so poorly written that they actually ruined the games and show for me in hindsight. First time I've ever lost interest in a franchise due to the source material.

fckwmq,brokenstratos,Just Finished The First Game,"So after nearly 50 hours I put down the Grand Master(Alvin, right?) and saved Foltest.  I have to say this game way exceeded my expectations, I know just about everyone says that the series is superb but after this game, I cannot wait to continue my dive into the Witcher universe.  I plan to finish the next two games read the books and eventually watch the series and after finishing this game I am more hyped than ever.  Once you get past the weird movement system, the weird framerate, the initially overwhelming inventory, and skills section, the weird framerate stuff, the...um... unique? combat system, and the general jank of a game nearly 13 years old it really shines.  The story is great, unsurprisingly, the voice acting is impressive, and I noticed a bunch of the sound effects are the same as the ones in Skyrim, just an interesting thing I noticed.  I have to say though it took my probably 4-5 months of occasional play to make it to the second act, but I knocked out the remainder in less than a week.

fcdq2i,Catsaremagnificent,"I just finished Witcher 2 (I know, only 8 years late) and I was BLOWN AWAY","I had played and finished Witcher 1 years and years ago. And despite loving the game, I couldn't get into 2 because of mainly technical issues (my pc at the time couldn't run the game for the life of it).

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I was lucky enough to be able to finish the game while playing in glorious 4K@60 fps - it's amazing how great this 8-yr old game still looks !

&amp;#x200B;

But what I came here for - I'm a great fan of most fantasy fiction, and I was just completely blown away by how the Witcher 2 goes from a game set in a fictional universe to a piece of said universe that sometimes even surpasses other media in almost every way.

&amp;#x200B;

The choices I was allowed to make (Letting S√≠le live or die in  a split second, letting Letho live or not, killing the dragon or not, ...) felt really, \*really\* impactful rather than just flavor, with real consequences down the line (only just started W3 with an imported save from W2!).

&amp;#x200B;

The emotion when Geralt mercy killed that dragon... holy shit!  


Just wanted to re-iterate that CDProject Red have absolutely created one of the best fantasy worlds in gaming, period. Sure they had a very fertile ground to work on, but to be able to not only live up to such expactations but clearly surpass them... damn...

And to think that I still have to start W3 and that everyone sort of agrees that W3 is still far superior to W2 in almost every regard, well. What better gift could one ask for?",12,1583163128,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fcdq2i/i_just_finished_witcher_2_i_know_only_8_years/,witcher,1

fc9vj6,Ivcabg20,Alchemy Build,"Hey lads and lasses. If you like playing the witcher the way I like to play it, you might find this build useful. 
Now bear in mind that I finished it after I got to lv100 on NG+ but if you get to a high enough level in vanilla without progressing a lot through the main game and the HoS DLC. You need to do the B&amp;W DLC up to the point where you get the items listed below.

Gear: Full manticore set, 
Steel sword: crafted tousaint knight's steel sword
Silver sword: Aerodnight FTW

Skill tree: Invested quite a lot in alchemy and combat. 
The build heavily relies on the usage of the Northern Wind bomb and the Moon Dust Bomb. Both provide a fair window where the enemy is vulnerable enough to a point where you can strike for a kill. The combo I go for is Northern Wind to freeze and then Whirl or Rend for maximum damage. The skill tree selections are below with explanation of every skill that you don't see quite often. 

Combat: 
5x Muscle Memory (duh)
5x Strenght Training (duh)
5x Crushing Blows (main attack is the strong attack after a bomb so a high crit chance and damage boost is mandatory)
5x Resolve
5x Undying since sometimes it just so happens that you're fighting 80000 enemies at once.
And finally 5x for Whirl and Rend

Alchemy: 
5x Heightened Tolerance
3x Acquired Tolerance
5x Tissue Transmutation
5x Endure Pain
5x Synergy because who doesn't like the mutagen bonuses
5x Efficiency since the build heavily uses bombs. 9 bombs per slot + 1 extra if you upgrade Corvo Bianco and take a nap.
And finally 5x Killing Spree

In the general branch:
Metabolic Control and In Combat's Fires


Mutation: Euphoria with 4 slots unlocked. Because who doesn't want a 247,5% increase in Attack Power?

The build is pretty straight forward. I manage to get about 60-75K crit damage with Rend after a Northern Wind bomb after I've drank 4 decoctions (below)

With the manticore ser managed to get 330 Texocity which easily fits 4 decoctions and leaves 50 more toxicity points for potions, etc.

I use the ArachGriffin decoction due to the fact out main attack is the Strong attack at a frozen enemy and the 5% drain is quite useful sometimes.

Next is the Ekimmara decoction which is basically healing you while you're hitting enemies. Simple.

We have the Water Hag decoction to increase damage while at max Vitality.

And last but not least, we have the Ekhidna decoction for healing at stamina consumption.

I also always use Superior Hanged Man's Venom on my steel sword just in case I run into a hanse base.

So that sums um the build. It's very straight forward. Similar to what you would see on youtube however I have concentrated my build over to 2 main attacks and potion resistance. Hope it works well for you guys. It's a very good build for NG+ since I tried it and lasted the whole game with it at Death March with enemy upscaling. You need a total of 78 Skill Points to do it, however if you get to level 50 in NG and do some exploring you will find more than enough Skill Points with the PoPs in the world. 

Good luck on the Path laddies and lasses.",2,1583142983,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fc9vj6/alchemy_build/,witcher,1

fc822o,Kisms,Just finished reading The Last Wish w/ minimal context to this universe,"Gotta say, I liked it and so I came here to nerd out a little bit.

I really enjoyed that we're introduced to this world in short stories. At first I thought it would be tacky, but I realize that I really enjoy the idea of Andrzej Sapkowski just loving this character that he was writing and kinda chronicling his adventures while building up the universe. I don't know if he had any end plot in mind, or was figuring it out along the way, but it was a very nice way of storytelling. I liked that I was coming to a fantasy universe where this devastating plotline about the destruction of something or some other wasn't being thrown into my face.

I'm also really impressed with how much I took to the style of writing. I've kinda gotten sick of really descriptive narratives that suck you into the character's stream of consciousness - I liked that we had mystery like, for example, when we knew that Geralt was aware of Mousesack's message in the price story but we didn't know WHAT it was. I think the translation gives it a degree of separation which I really enjoyed too.

Easily, my favorite Geralt moments:
- his ""therapy session"" with Iola and the fact that it was just HIM TALKING TO HIMSELF. The whole chapter. I haven't seen anything like that I loved it.
- when he was trying to punish the Sylvan like someone would with a child. ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" Lol
- ""money opens all doors"" also very lol
- the moment when I realized that when he told the djin to go ""fck"" himself is when he cast his first wish LMAO. That was so clever.

Mainly, I'm just very excited to get into a fictional universe that has so much content that I can enjoy for a good long while. And also the fact that content is being created so I can jump on that curveball and enjoy the waiting process!!

Am I the only one that was hit pretty hard by Aplegatt's death? I liked him a lot, he was so happy to be useful again and really gave the feeling that he enjoyed his work. 

He had such a eventfull trip with having Ciri prophesize his death, then seeing the manticore and meeting Geralt twice. Then after all that hard work he asked Dijkstra just for a few hours of sleep that would have saved his life but he was denied, matters of state were to important. And lastly the elf that killed him did it on a whim basically and probably started a war since the message won't be delivered.

I don't usually get attached to secondary characters in books/movies but it was something in the way Aplegatt was presented that just made me like the guy a lot.

fbvzx4,iamralphfiennes,Question regarding witcher 3 spoiler [spoilers] wouldn't mind an opinion or 2,"So I heard Ciri can die in one/some of the endings. I take it that's a bit of a spoiler but whatever, it doesn't bother me since its optional.

Instead, what I want to ask about is rather that I heard (I think) what effects whether she lives or dies or not, what decisions affect that. Basically, I heard that as long as you let her be independent, let her learn and be supportive to her (and if you just generally be a good father to her) then everything works out. My question is, is that true, or is it more complicated than just that?

Please don't be specific or anything in your answer because I'd rather not know anymore than I do, so just a ""yes that's basically it"" or a ""no there are much more complicated decisions to make that affect whether she lives or dies than just that"" would be excellent.

fbs1xd,citybildr,Bigger roles for other Witchers,"Other witchers aka Lambert, Eskel, Vesemir, and Coen only appear in briefly in the novels. If it wasnt for the games I wouldn't even remember they exist or what their personalities are like, or that they're like brothers to Geralt instead of just ""co-workers"" who just met at least once a year in an old decrepit castle (because thats what I kinda think?)

I've been led to believe they're not as close as people think because how can you be friends with someone when you barely see them at all? And in Battle of Kaer Morhen I think they didnt really fight for Ciri or Geralt but they fought because they felt like they had to do it because the castle was kinda their home sweet home. I mean if Ciri teleported anywhere else than Kaer Morhen Lambert and co wouldn't go out of their way to risk their necks. And this is confirmed when after the battle of Kaer Morhen they went their separate ways instead of staying and help Geralt and Ciri.

Thats why I think they really need to have bigger role in the series so it doesnt feel like they're ""shoehorned"" in there instead of someone that Geralt can naturally trust to be in his corner. 

What I propose in the series to cement their relationship as bros is to have the game's ""Witcher getting drunk"" moment. And then have Lambert train Ciri (instead of Geralt) like in the books (because they need to be close to Ciri if they're going to care about her fate later on).

Then we can go fully AU here and have one of them tag along when Geralt and Ciri went south to Ellander.

Once in Ellander I think it should be purely Yennefer and Ciri's bonding moment though I believe there's a gap between Ciri's arrival in Ellander and meeting Yennefer. Maybe have the Witcher who tagged along wounded in the scoiatel ambush  giving hin reason to be recuperating in Ellander and help continue Ciri's training. 

I dont think it makes sense for any of the Witchers to be in Aretuza.

Next opportunity would be when Geralt sets out to find Ciri, maybe have one of the Witchers here, for parts of the journey at least.

Or maybe  and its a crazy idea have Lambert or Eskel in the far south taking contracts and came across the rats or Ciri with Bonhart. Maybe Eskel saw Ciri in the hands of Bonhart tried to rescue her by fighting Bonhart but lost?

And Coen, I know his part is not as big as Lamber and Eskel, but hos story is an interesting one. The series need to delve into his reasoning behind his participatio  in Brenna.

So...what do you guys think? Should other Witchers have more presence in the series and if so how would you like the show runners to go about it?",14,1583057073,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fbs1xd/bigger_roles_for_other_witchers/,witcher,1

This would be fine and easy to comprehend, if it wasn't for the fact that in the prior chapter from The Voice of Reason, Geralt is talking about how the child is already born and he has no intention of ever returning to Cintra...thus meaning he doesn't want it.

I can honestly say that aside from Tamara and Graden (Although only slightly from the latter) no redeeming qualities come from any member of the church. They‚Äôre obviously meant to be the villains and as characters they fit that role very well. 

They, like the Inquisition, are a great example of what happens when religious fanatics gain power. Both force their religious dogmas on people. Both persecute certain groups that are deemed heretical, using them as scapegoats for anything bad that happens. For the Inquisition it was Protestants and Jews, For the Eternal Fire it‚Äôs mages, alchemists, herbalists, and non-humans. They both started witch hunts, burning people at the stake. Going through Novigrad you see everyone on edge, accusing their neighbors of heresy for the slightest things.

fbpk7h,Heroclueless,Note to Witcher fans,"Fans, Just agree that Netflix's Witcher is another bad fanfic. Not even troubadour Jaskier can elevate its inelegance in his rendition.

Reasons :

1) Dialogues (soulless, mostly that of Yennefer's)
2) Three non-linear plots in almost every episode. This is the reason for not using Witcher Saga's dialogic format, which embraces the situation then and there.
3) Constant reference to Ciri's arrival (Even from Renfri).
4) Calanthe, maybe a lioness of Cintra but Netflix's version doesn't have the potential of the character we read from books.
5) Accents of Posada are similar to that of witcher's. 
6) Too much nudity that was uncalled-for. I don't remember Yennefer being topless in the book during the Djinn summoning ritual. Or at the very best, book has better Djinn episode than the one we were forced to watch. 
7) Casting choices that aren't practically made to fit the time period of the world. (Anachronism, because of the silliest progressive move) 
8) Age paradox of certain characters. Jaskier and Ciri's. 
9) The Medallion. 

But in all honesty, it is not a bad show. It is just a bad adaptation. I liked it despite its flaws, that is from the logical inaccuracies to its own mark of progressivism. (I don't intend to comment on the progressive side of it because Witcher game saga has its own brand of progressivism but it goes with the flow of narrative not against it like Netflix's one). I hate the show for one reason, they casted a beautiful person as Renfri, a character that was created to die and torment Geralt. Instead it torments us for we could not see her anymore on the screen. Emma Appleton should've been casted as Triss, at least to be more on the series (well, that's just a ramble and highly unneeded opinion of mine). 

Final note: In the end, we got a theatrical performance than a cinematic one. Only Geralt's fight sequences are worth mentioning. If episodes didn't follow three-storyline principle which was adapted from Dunkirk, the series would've been a masterpiece or at the very least episodes should've been a little longer to accommodate the dialogues. Instead of this-and-that of what I've mentioned, all that we got is an unneeded load of F-Words.",19,1583040557,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fbpk7h/note_to_witcher_fans/,witcher,1

fbhmz2,_TheRogue_,Suggestion for a better Quen focused build? (FYI: you can benefit from Gryphon/Bear Schools simultaneously),"I wanted to make a Quen-focused build... so I dumped all of my points into Quen and geared up Legendary Grandmaster Ursine Armor.  I also enchanted my chestpiece to make all armor considered ""medium"".  

I noticed that I could keep my Bear School Bonus (heavy attack + health) and add the Gryphon School Bonus (sign intensity and stamina regen).  

This effectively gives me 8890 Vitality, 174% Sign Intensity, 2621 Quen physical damage reduction.  (NOT including the extra 200% from the 6th piece of Ursine!) 42/s stamina regen in combat. Make sure you've opted for Gorged on Power (Indefinite Quen Place of Power), Survival School Instinct (500 vitality), Bear/Gyphon School techniques, Focus, and Conductors of Magic (mutation that increases sign damage with a special sword drawn).  And, of course, I've maximized all my Quen Signs and have them increased with Greater Blue mutagens. 

This build is WITHOUT any additional effects from potions that could make Quen more potent (Petri's Philter, Full Moon, etc)

Besides popping potions- can anyone think of a way to increase my Quen shield/damage?",5,1583004447,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fbhmz2/suggestion_for_a_better_quen_focused_build_fyi/,witcher,0

fbhjeb,ScriptGenius12,Just finished the Towerful of Mice quest,"I started off by watching the netlifx series and became an instant fan, and my brother got me Wild Hunt because he was a big fan before this too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've loved it so far.

I've played Geralt as a compassionate character whose become a kinder man do to Ciri's influence in the past, and I've had him always do the ""Right"" thing like giving food to hungry children, rejecting payment in the Shrieker contract so that the little boy will have it as he needs it more, working towards nonviolent solutions, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I came up to this quest. It seemed straigtforwards; gvie the bones back to Graham so Ana could be laid to rest.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he dies and Ana becomes a Plague Maiden that I can't even put down. Trying to play the obvious Hero choice didn't work out.

&amp;#x200B;

Now in-character I have this event be what causes Geralt to become far harsher, not wanting anything like this mistake to happen again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I now have him go around bluntly threatening to kill people who challenge him to fights if they don't back off, and I always haggle for more coin when I get the chance on a contract.

so, the problem here is that i remember doing the first part, or at least a similar encounter with dijkstra &amp; roche, but not the rest. it's not listed anywhere on the quest lists, despite me completing all the quests necessary to start this one and when i go to the docks by myself there isn't anything hinting to this quest so i'm really at a loss as how to find it.

i definitely **never** killed radovid or chose to help or walk away from roche &amp; thaler later. so how is it i don't have this quest in my lists anywhere and how can i find it again?

fbdcq3,Jvrossi,Which countries do you think are the IRL equivalents of the Witcher kingdoms?,"I‚Äôve been think about this for a while and I‚Äôve come up with an idea of some.

IMO-

Temeria: Northern medieval France. The biggest thing that made me think that is because the Temerian coat of arms is a Fleur De Lis, also just the whole aesthetic of the people and the kingdom itself makes me think of this very stereotypical medieval French style, like how King Foltest is dresses, how Vizima looks and among other things.

Kovir: Switzerland. What makes me think that is due to Kovir being a cold and rich kingdom, their extensive use of mercenaries and lastly their neutrality throughout the wars.

Redania: Poland. I haven‚Äôt though about Redania a lot but what makes me think that are a few things: The Redanian coat of arms and colours of the kingdom are almost literally the ones of Poland. There is one catch tho, during the HOS DLC there is one side quest of this guy that tries to create a ‚ÄúRedanian Air Force‚Äù composed of harpies, and in one of his documents he calls it something among the lines of ‚Äúluftwaffe‚Äù. That makes me think that Redania speaks at least some degree of German.

I‚Äôve also seen some people saying that Aedirn=Germany
Kadwem= Whales (?)
But I don‚Äôt rlly see it.

fbb1ou,spirtomb1831,[SPOIL] Why were you disapointed by the Wild Hunt?,"When you learned that they were elves?

Elves aren't all kind tree huggers, haven't you heard about the Drows from D&amp;D, the dunmer from the elder scrolls or the Noldor from LOTR? Hell even the wood elves from the elder scrolls and warhammer are far from peaceful tree huggers, the first are cannibals demons who can change their shapes and the latters kill everyone who enter their forest plus they have a ritual called the wild hunt where they go slaughter humans or others outside their forest.

Elves can be evil and badass and in this context they tricked everyone, all people thought that they were a legend or a natural phenomenon, the elite Nilfgaardian soldiers didn't even fight the riders who wanted to take Geralt and Ciri. Also Geralt and Eskel didn't dare fight Imlerith directly because they didn't know what he was. Even in the end aside from Geralt and some others, no one knows that these ghosts are actually elves.

If they were dwarves I would have agreed that this would have been ridiculous, horseless demons who are half your size... Yeah this would be ridiculous",12,1582974226,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fbb1ou/spoil_why_were_you_disapointed_by_the_wild_hunt/,witcher,1

fb78nf,Perluda,Witcher 3 - SPOILERS! Bloody Baron Choice,"So I‚Äôve done some pretty through research about this quest in the game witcher 3 because every outcome seems to come with some ugly string attached but I wanted to clarify a few things because there‚Äôs so much floating around out there that is unknown or being misconstrued about this quest. 

First let‚Äôs start with a book called ‚ÄúShe who Knows‚Äù as well as the character profiles you read about the crones. In this book it clearly describes a creature/god/other worldly being who descended on Velen thousands of years ago and called herself the Lady of the Wood. This creature which was not human nor elf but of indescribable appearance took care of the people of Velen. She was widely thought to be a form of druidess as she only used plant based earth magic to help the people but she grew terribly lonely so she created three daughters from earth wind and fire to be her wards. These ‚Äúdaughters‚Äù were sent across the land to help the people and the Lady drew into reclusion from the world leaving her daughters to do all the work and the people loved them for it. It is here that the text gets fuzzy on details but it says that the Lady went mad (according to the daughters) and started performing dark magic that was harming the people so they killed her and trapped her spirit within a tree. As this legend was written and purported by the daughters who are the crones and the crones are clearly evil it can be assumed that the story of the Lady going mad was actually a complete lie that was bolstered by the crones followers who mainly inhabited downwarren the village that is resolutely dedicated to the crones continued witchcraft. 

It is in knowing this that the answers on which ending is the ‚Äúbetter of two evils‚Äù becomes clear. The spirit has likely been enraged and trapped for years and has had nothing but her discontent to sow into the world hence why it can be seen as evil. The crones clearly fear her or they wouldn‚Äôt ask you to kill her permanently. So freeing her is the logical choice and allowing the last of the crones followers to die and not allow them to continue feeding the crones magic with their children is certainly the better choice.

And what of the baron and his family troubles? Well letting them both die? Seems like the more fitting ending and I‚Äôll tell you why. The Barron is truely a terrible man despite how he feels about it he cannot he excused for his unforgivable behaviour and neither can his wife. You see in we finally discover the reason he beat his wife is because she was incredibly lonely with only Tamara for comfort while he was away during the war and found love in someone else. The Barron upon discovering this secret subsequently kills the man Anna loves so deeply in front of her and then forces her to continue being his wife. Completely inexcusable on both their behalf‚Äôs and of course they drag poor Tamara into it continually, which destroys her as a young adult. 

Anna then in her desperation to be rid of the Barron does the only thing she can think of to rid herself of the man and his soon to be new child by asking the crones for their help and pledging her allegiance to them. 

Ultimately we have the Barron forcing his now alcohol soaked presence on his family who don‚Äôt want him while they desperatly try to get away. Anna loves children and loves the children she cares for in the swamp at the crones behest. To save the children by using the tree spirit, allowing Anna to pass as a human with her faculties intact knowing the children are safe and saying a real goodbye with her only daughter which leaves the Barron only one choice to have to live without his family or kill himself I truely believe letting him make that choice is not truely the worst ending. 

Tamara would never have regained her mother had they sought help and Anna may not have made the journey despite and she would have to do it with the barrons help and despite him trying to be good now even if Anna recovered would she truely be happy? She ran away to a swamp to be slave just to be as far away from him as possible she couldn‚Äôt stand looking at him for killing her lover. She would have never been happy and the cycle would face started again. 

It is my sole opinion that the BEST ending to this quest is to free the spirit. Save the children. Destroy the crones source of power in downwarren. Allow Anna the dignity of dying, let the baron choose his own end and allow Tamara to set it all to rest with the help of friends and other loved ones. 

I‚Äôd be happy to hear other people‚Äôs opinions.",21,1582950276,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fb78nf/witcher_3_spoilers_bloody_baron_choice/,witcher,1

Somebody dropped their BALL FLAIL and I can pick that up and use it? Check.   


1. What happened to that? Like TW3 would have been even better if I could skull crack someone/thing, and get a meaty response. 
2. Why not a greatsword? When you're about to go down with something that weighs the equivalent of a Volva station wagon? Wouldn't you want to take a bit more . . . ass?
3. 2. Why do Witchers suck with other weapons? If you played TW1, and tried using that then you quickly figured out Geralt NEEDS a sword.

fb256s,WastelandViking,"So, ""the witcher"" TV casting!! 1 good pr 2 bad ?..."," Kim Bodnia   as ves is an 100% perfect fit and choise !! despite what star wars fanboys says, 100% WELL DONE!! 

But PLEASE take more care when it comes to other roles, like Yen and triss. Actresses are probably ok, burt they dont fit these 2 ""characthers"".    


For my Personal opinion YEN should have been famke janssen,  
 (look too Xmen and Hansel and gretle ).    
She has the Controlled chaos vibe yet, having the hint of letting it all BURN if it suits her\\or her Guilds purposes.  And that just by looking at her, when she talks she does have a extensive vocabulary and she knows how to say things too make em sound either vague and have you guyss what her meaning is, or straight up chillingly excellent threats.   Does not hurt that she looks pretty good too, and for whatever battlewounds and scarss Yen has\\gets, her complextion and bone structre (famkes) is excellent for even this!. Showing off comming scars ect .   


Triss merigold  Could also have been way better, though as the charactyer is more playful and ""fun"" then yen. Having a slightly softer actress play her would be an idea.     


Actresses who might fit this in MY OPINION is : Natalie Dormer, Emilia clarke, Alyson hannigan. or Felicia day or something.    


I honestly feel these 2 were filled by who they were filled by for no other reason then the current ""offend no one, include everyone"" thing that rocks holywood these days. Not who would fit or do a good job.   


I also dont like Cavil as geralt but he does a lossely passable job i guess.   


And before you go ""you dont like, dont watch"" or ""your not a fan"" in my PMs or whatever.   


I LOVE the witcher, i LOVE CD projects red version of it and  Andrzej version of it. I love the world, the people and the beasts and myths and just endless shenanigans of it all.  I just feel the show took its ques from last season of ""game of thrones"",  Low effort - and proffit of the Name\\brand.

This time I'm trying to do things differently and decided to kill Radovid. My question is if the outcome of this quest later on in the game comes with any type of consequence (in the main questline) and if we get any kind of cutscene (as in the Lambert+Keira and Bloody Baron conclusion ones). If so I'd really apreciate if anyone could link or list me the outcome for: Killing Radovid and Dijkstra, Killing Radovid and Roche/Ves/Thaler and Refusing to kill Radovid.

faw4z3,Interneteldar,"Witcher 3 Enhanced Edition, Ghost Mode or Vanilla for first playthrough?","Hi guys! So I want to start playing Wild Hunt, and I am aware that there are two large overhaul mods for it. I likee the added realism and focus on player skill and control (deleveling, manual aim etc.) that W3EE provides a lot, but I'm wondering whether it would be prudent to start with it right off the bat. I don't have too much time for gaming, so I'd really rather not have 2 full playthroughs. I understand that Ghost Mode enhances and fixes some features in the vanilla game instead of outright replacing them, so I guess I'd install it if I don't use W3EE.

TL:DR: Is W3EE suitable enough for a completely new player (played W1&amp;2), or should I instead play vanilla/GM to avoid getting shafted? I'm not a particularly hardcore player but I like a challenge.

I followed her to the letter so I don't know what it can be. At first I thought that, having the game in Spanish, some files would be missing but no, the game is frozen in English or Spanish. I also mess arround with the settings, putting and removing things but the game continues to collapse at the moment of making my first decision in this incredible game. I'm running out of ideas but I really want to live The Witcher experience in its best version (with mods) If any of you have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to solve this problem please tell me, I will be eternally grateful.

fatmcd,Cecylio19,Witcher3 modding question,"Howdy!

I'm kinda new (and late) to the game, but I already dislike couple of things. Currently I'm starting fresh new game, again, but I wonder about mods. There are so many and I'm not sure which to pick.

What I want to achieve, basically, is to get rid of levels, more or less. I want to travel freely, not worrying about quest/contract being too low or too high on level and/or monsters being too overleveled. Wherever I would go, I want to do my stuff and proceed. So, only quests and monsters, not equipement included. And at the same time, it would be cool to keep some level of challenge and not mess with vanilla too much (aka Enhanced Edition mod).

Enemy levels makes no sense - every Drowner should be as strong as every other Drowner. It's obvious bosses and/or contract monster could be a bit more powerful, but mobs? How is Geralt capable of killing that Ghoul, but not this one? He's already trained, he went through mutation - he can't possibly get any stronger, he's perfect monster killing machine. Leveling itself does not bother me that much - it feels like staying in best witcher-ish shape.

I need your help solving this problem: when I get to the first dialogue option in The witcher 1 enhanced edition (when you have to decide whether to help Triss or Vesemir in kaer morhen) the screen freezes and I can't go further. As the game is quite a few years old I decided to put some Mods on it, for this I followed this guide:

https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/bwpkia/the_witcher_enhanced_edition_updated_2019_modding/

I followed her to the letter so I don't know what it can be. At first I thought that, having the game in Spanish, some files would be missing but no, the game is frozen in English or Spanish. I also mess arround with the settings, putting and removing things but the game continues to collapse at the moment of making my first decision in this incredible game. I'm running out of ideas but I really want to live The Witcher experience in its best version (with mods)
If any of you have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to solve this problem please tell me, I will be eternally grateful.

fal3tj,Mapiarz,White Frost lore questions to book readers (and maybe gamers)!,"Hi!

Here [https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/White\_Frost](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/White_Frost), in the second paragraph, it says:

&gt; As stated by [Avallac'h](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Avallac%27h)[\[1\]](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/White_Frost#cite_note-0) and [Nimue](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Nimue_verch_Wledyr_ap_Gwyn),[\[2\]](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/White_Frost#cite_note-1) the White Frost is a poetic metaphor for an upcoming ice age caused by changes in the [planet](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/World)'s  orbit and axis, which would cause most of the northern hemisphere to  freeze around 3.000 years after Nimue's life. The apocalypse could not  be prevented, neither by [mages](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Mage), [Aen Saevherne](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Aen_Saevherne), nor even [Ciri](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ciri). The only salvation was to open the [Ard Gaeth](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ard_Gaeth) [portals](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Portal) by [Elder Blood](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Elder_Blood) so that people of the [Continent](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Continent) could move to [another](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Multiverse) world.  

The fact that White Frost is simply a natural climate change is clear to me. What I find confusing, is that it says the World (as in, the one where Geralt and Ciri live) would succumb to White Frost about 3000 years after Nimue's life. I assume that is long after Ciri and Geralt passed away but then in the next sentence it mentions that Ciri could not protect the World from it and that people of the Continent were evacuated to another world. Where is that information from? The books? If so, which one? Can someone elaborate on this?

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, on the same page, is this image: [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/witcher/images/c/c8/Gwent\_cardart\_neutral\_white\_frost.png](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/witcher/images/c/c8/Gwent_cardart_neutral_white_frost.png)

I understand that this is Gwent card art, but is it based on something described in the games/books? Or simply a 'what if' scenario, showing how Novigrad would look like when hit by the ever lasting winters of White Frost?

faixvx,iP0dKiller,My opinion on making changes in adaptations of books (not only The Witcher) | Books and Netflix' The Witcher season 1 spoilers,"My general position is that I initially have nothing against changes in adaptations, because if I have read a book or book series, I don't want the same story told twice in exactly the same way. That doesn't mean that I want a total change of the story. No, I really don't. As long as changes are made   
 well I don't have a problem with it. Here an example:

They way how Geralt gets to the banquet of Calanthe where different proposals are offered to Pavetta and Duny appears. In the books Geralt gets hired to go there, sits beside the queen and waits what is going to happen. In the series Jaskier brings him there and it does not harm the story and adds a little bit of fun due to the bard. The story is still the same in regards of the ending and how they get there; the famous ""moral of the story"" is still in there.

&amp;#x200B;

Here a bad example:

Ciri in the forest of Brokilon and how the introduced her from the beginning. At first I don't have a problem with the decision to introduce her already in the first episode, but it could have been executed better: it shouldn't be told from the beginning that she is Geralt's destiny and vice versa. Her story line could have been told just as if it is parallel story where in the end we and Gerald find out, oh, this is what Pavetta and Duny, later on Calanthe, owe Geralt due to the Law of Surprise. I don't have a problem that they add Dara to the story, because it is not important how she arrived at Brokilon.

Another thing that could have been told better is the huge time gaps between the story lines of Geralt, Yen and Ciri.

&amp;#x200B;

My first main point is that I don't like it when people just bashing because changes are made without thinking about that it is either unimportant and that it might keep the story more interesting for the book readers.

My second one is, that it is stupid to evaluate and judge announced changes and additional, new characters before you haven't seen what it is all about, before you have seen the result. This is also the reason why I wrote this long post: I already saw people mourning about the additional characters before knowing what is going to happen.",3,1582837535,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/faixvx/my_opinion_on_making_changes_in_adaptations_of/,witcher,1

I'm trying to get an understanding of how the players look at the various instances of racism and hate towards elves and dwarves in the games, and how they deal with them. I have created a straw poll, and if you have the time I'd ask you to leave your personal input.

Instead, what I want to ask about is rather that I heard (I think) what effects whether she lives or dies or not, what decisions affect that. Basically, I heard that as long as you let her be independent, let her learn and be supportive to her (and if you just generally be a good father to her) then everything works out. My question is, is that true, or is it more complicated than just that?

 Please don't be specific or anything in your answer because I'd rather not know anymore than I do, so just a ""yes that's basically it"" or a ""no there are much more complicated decisions to make that affect whether she lives or dies than just that"" would be excellent.

It isn't revealed who this mysterious person is, but later on, it seems like Stregobor's response to this statement is aimed toward Geralt, which is what confuses me. Anyone able to clarify this bit at all?

Also, why did Geralt decide in the end that killing Renfri and the gang was the lesser evil, rather than killing Stregobor? That's killing 8 people vs 1. Or did he justify it based on the fact that if Renfri lives, she will continue to kill more and more people in the future?",24,1582777268,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/fa6hld/the_lesser_evil_clarification/,witcher,1

f9v85q,JustNotMe21,I don't know what to do,"About a week ago I started playing The witcher 3: Wild hunt. That week was probably the best week in my life. Now I completed the game (with about half the sidequests done) and I started crying. I have some minor mental issues and this game helped me with them a lot (I am talking about depression). I got in my opinion the best ending (Ciri becomes a witcher). But I just feel empty and sad. When I asked some people what should I do if I really liked the story most of them said to either replay the game or do everything in order. I am leaning more on the second option tho (I mean reading all the books, then playing the first two games and maybe then replaying the game). But I know that I have the two expansions but I feel even more sad because when I did some reading I found out that only in the second expansion you get to see the main characters and just for a bit (I guees I just started to like them just a bit too much). I also know that this game is highly replayable but I feel that in order to replay the game I would have to do it after I experienced the story before it.

So.. What do I do?

Should I play the expansions and then feel sad again when I finnish them?

Or should I do as I planned to read all the books and then come back to the games.

I would really like to read the books and play the old games, but I feel like I just won't have the motivation to play the older games for some reason or even to replay the 3rd game after them.

Has anyone been in my place before? I really don't know what to do.

I just started the Time of Contempt. Geralt is talking to Codringher and Fenn. The lawyers are explaining how Calanthe was plotting to stay on the throne as she did not have a male heir and the aristocrats did not believe she had a right to the throne. 

Codringher explains that by postponing Pavetta's wedding until she was 15, she knew Pavetta would have fooled around with someone by then, meaning she could have already gotten pregnant and would have to marry the random guy, instead of being wed to someone who was able to take the throne of Cintra. This would obviously allow Calanthe to continue her reign. 

He also says how she took advantage of ""some Witcher"" because she knew Pavetta was with Urcheon, a cursed ""beast"" man. 

So, did Calanthe hire Geralt to make it look like she wanted Urcheon dead, so it not seem like she played the Aristocrats by postponing the wedding until Pavetta already had a lover? But in reality, she knew Geralt would never actually kill Urcheon since he was a man, and Geralt would defend him while she make a scene in front of everyone. Thus, she could marry Eist and not have to worry about losing the throne to a price of a foreign city. 

My real question is, was this all true, or did Codringher make it up to de-legitamize Ciri's claim to the throne of Cintra so kings would stop hunting her? 

If this was actually Calanthe's plan, that's insane. 

Thanks.",5,1582731658,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f9v2a3/calanthe_highering_geralt_clarification/,witcher,1

f9tnzd,Mastercreed25,Game characters in the show?,"It occurred to me while playing the Witcher 3 today that some of the fan favourite characters within the game series aren't in the books, and therefore aren't likely to be in the show. But I think there are a few examples where they would actually fit in (Obviously having to change the age and such of some of them).

Roche, for example. Now, ill admit, im slightly bias cause Roche is one of my favourite characters from the Witcher as a whole, but putting him in the show wouldn't be that hard. He's, in short, part of Temeria's army, and so putting him in wouldn't be too hard I don't think, even if hes just there whenever Foltest is as an advisor, being head of the Blue Stripes Commandos. Obviously you'd have to switch the timeframe round a bit, since at the time of the books and the time between the books and games, Roche is supposed to be a homeless alchoholic from what I understand, who was only saved by Foltest recently by the time of the Witcher 2. But I think it could still work.

In the same sort of ideal, Thaler would be interesting to see. Similar to Roche, hed be an advisor, being the head of Temerian intelligence, but I think the ""unique"" nature of his personality would be interesting to see on screen

Iorveth, though I don't know where tbh, could also work. He's mentioned in the books to be fighting on the side of Nilfgaard in the Second War, so I don't think it would be too far a leap to put him in somewhere, though as I said, I don't know where exactly, but its interesting to think about

The point being, I really think some of the fan favourites from the game would work in the show, so im just curious to see everyone elses thoughts on it",6,1582725809,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f9tnzd/game_characters_in_the_show/,witcher,1

My questions lie with regards to the games combat difficulty. I don't typically combat games and I know a large part of the gameplay here is combat. Realistically all I care about is the story and the lore. So:

1. Can you change the difficulty mid-game? If I were to play on normal difficulty and find the combat boring and prefer to just blaze through it, could I mid-game change the setting and just cheese it on easy?

2. Does changing difficulty impact anything else? I *like* puzzling, solving problems, games, etc and would rather a challenge in those regards than in combat.

f9lcdw,elilielila,"I hate Ciri. I want her to die, i will make her die","TL;DR Ciri is a murderer of innocents and deserves to die for her actions.

You know when Ciri joins up with the Rats and quite literally becomes a bloodthirsty murderer who enjoys killing innocents? Yeah, i don't get how anyone can have sympathy for her after that. She actually enjoys murdering innocents. She wants to watch them bleed out. She can't redeem herself after murdering so many innocents FOR FUN, no matter what she does or doesn't do. 

Let's look at someone who can redeen themselves: Arthur Morgan from RDR2. He is a murderer and for sure a bad person. But he never canonically murders innocent civilians at all, especially not for fun. He did what he had to do to survive. He actually criticizes Dutch for his senseless killing. Ciri never even really shows any regret for killing all those innocents. Ciri is beyond redemption.

I'm 100% going to do a run of TW3 where i make Ciri die. She deserves it without a question. Good riddance, i say.",34,1582681237,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f9lcdw/i_hate_ciri_i_want_her_to_die_i_will_make_her_die/,witcher,1
f9l3f1,Xudda,"So, what's your favorite quest in TW3 and why?","I played through the main game and HoS back in 2017, but I burned out around the beginning of blood and wine. Just picked the game up again a week or two ago, I figured I'd leave the remainder of the game for a rainy day. I have to say that payed off, returning to the game and still having loads to do has been a great time. Watching the series on Netflix at the same time has been really cool. I loved the world before but now I really appreciate it even more. Might even grab some of the books for the heck of it.

Anyways, I just came across this quest ""paper chase"" in beauclair, and it's honestly just hysterical to see Geralt getting caught up in something so modern and mundane as he gets jerked around by the bank.. an obvious parody of modern day customer support. Really been having a good time with this game again, I never fast travel.. Toussaint is so lovely and the game is immersive I usually just walk or walk on horseback to my destinations, getting lost in the amazing visuals and worlds is honestly as fun as the rest of the ""game"". Being part of the Witcher world is a game in and of itself. Truly awesome stuff.

f9kjl8,Dixie-Chink,Exploring the Witcher through the Netflix Series (New Fan),"
So I'm probably one of many new faces drawn to discussion here because of the new Netflix Series The Witcher.  I realize that puts me at somewhat of a disadvantage in some ways, but I've had many thoughts and reactions percolate in my mind since starting the series, and I finally feel like I am in a good spot to ask some questions and possibly have some discussion regarding how I felt about it.  This may seem like a long post, and for that I apologize.  I simply have a lot of context to sort through.

To begin with, I've never been a fan of the Witcher series of games, and was ignorant of the fact they were taken from existing books.  I feel I may have presupposed some undeserved bias right out of the door, but my only personal exposure with the Witcher was the very first installment right after it was licensed onto Bioware's Aurora Engine, in the wake of the much beloved Baldur's Gate gamesback in the 90's.  

I was a child of books and fantasy however, and much enamored of the escapism of role-playing games such as D&amp;D.  I did not much care for the style of gaming where one assumed an existing character, rather than creating a character of their very own, which is where my bias against most JRPG's and the Witcher stems from.  So for a long, long time, I shelved the one copy of the Witcher I had, and never looked back.  Despite that many of my friends over the years swore to me that the Witcher 3 was a great game, I still never considered myself to be interested in it.

So it was with some degree of skepticism that I allowed myself to be cajoled into watching this new Netflix series.  I'm not much a mass media consumer, books are my preferred escapism, and even then I tend to be very picky about what I read.  But I am a lover of myth, folklore, and history, and those were my fields of passion and study in university.  So I was surprised to learn that the stories presented here are drawn from the deep, rich waters of Polish and Slavic folklore and myths.  This intrigued me and I decided to give it a chance.

The first episode was very difficult to get through however, as it felt light on story and world building to begin with, and more focused on flashy set-pieces.  But the second episode drew me in and I immediately felt a strong affinity for the character of Yennefer.  My feelings on the character would wax and wane, evolving and changing as the season's storyline progressed, but for now I was hooked and invested.  Yennefer felt human, real, fleshed out with emotions and conflict, and I knew immediately that I loved her for that.

And now I suppose is the point where as I ask questions about characters and discuss specific points in the series, is where some spoiler tags might be neccessary...

[Spoiler](/s ""Geralt:  I don't actually have much to say about Geralt overall.  He feels very much written to be a character 'witness' or reactor to events, rather than an initiator of events.  This is not a bad thing, for some of the finest characters in mythic and fantasy literature are written thusly.  But it does make him harder to analyze, for he displays fewer signs of agenda, belief, and motivations unless the world acts upon him to reveal them.  The first episode does him few favors here, as he is the first real character to be shown onscreen, and so the build up is very choppy before we begin to learn about the world around him, and how Geralt views it.  But over time, I feel like he gets more nuanced and complex, though I sense that there's just a tad bit of author-insert when he speaks about humanity, philosophy, and politics.  There's a bit of a modern voice in his words and views, which sometimes stands out amidst the semi-feudal setting and its emerging burgher/bourgeoisie class."")[/Spoiler] 

[Spoiler](/s ""Yennefer: I was drawn into Yennefer's story from the start, and while it echoes some aspects of classic wizards and coming of age, such as Ged from the timeless Wizard of Earthsea, Yennefer sharply deviates as a character after Episode 3, into a compelling but painful arc to watch as she hardens herself and forsakes the girl she was to become the woman she thinks she wants to be.  Power becomes her means to the same end.  Power and empowerment.  She destroys personal bond after personal bond, in pursuit of fleeting goals that prove meaningless.  Court office and titles reward her with disillusionment.  She chases after the possibility of motherhood, which she feels cheated of, but we as the audience bore witness to how eagerly she sacrificed it when she thought she wanted beauty and power.  She beleives that she wants to be important to someone.  She desperately wants to be loved. But when she has it, not once but thrice, she lashes out against those that offer her what love they are capable of giving, unable of recognizing Istredd's 'safe and boring' love, Tissaia's love as a teacher and a maternal figure, and Geralt's simple unadorned love and concern for her well being.  It makes me feel as if she's a tragic figure, intended for a fiery crash in the manner of so many of my own Chinese homeland's myths of heroism, growth, and ultimately tragic sacrifice."")[/Spoiler] 

[Spoiler](/s ""Ciri: I'm probably going to get some hate here, but I find Ciri the weakest and most unlikable of characters to date.  She falls unfortuantely into a recently commonplace pattern that crops up in fantasy literature of recent decades.  She's told to the audience that she has immense potential, destiny, and is obviously being propped up to be a likable character that an audience is supposed to identify with as a heroine.  But...  like a similar character from another popular series, a certain 'mother of dragons', she displays precious few qualities of her own that justify that initial investment of faith and belief.  She's certainly sympathetic, her suffering is one that cries out for empathy, but she doesn't display positive qualities that would reward that loyalty.  If anything, she's somewhat of a 'user', who is carried along by the sacrifices of other far nobler characters.  The one act of kindness she displays throughout the entire season, is giving up one leather glove to Dara when his hands are cold.  At all other times, she's needy, sometimes even petty, and it's never *shown* why she's going to be a great Queen soemday, merely that others parrot that to us over and over again in the dialogue.  Also like my earlier comparison to 'that other queen', her only talent seems to be a gift of unexplainable script immunity- in Ciri's case a scream that conveniently saves her life as a deux ex machina as opposed to inexplicable dragons.  But the function is identical, they exist to make her special and outstanding in situations where she has no recourse and the plot has written her into a corner.  But what's most important to me is not that she starts off competent, for indeed some of the most appealing heroes of myth across the world start off gallingly incompetent, but that she displays growth and the desire to learn, to become a heroine. This is a trait we've really seen nothing displayed of at all.  Dara has it right when he says she's got no drive or purpose, other than doing what her grandmother told her to do.  I don't think Ciri knows what she's even doing, much less WHY.  She's certainly not trying to change the world, make it a better place, or even avenge her family and establish that justice is done.  She's just...  there for the ride. "")[/Spoiler] 

[Spoiler](/s ""Calanthe:  And now here's a character I really loved, one who's incredibly complex and deeply flawed, almost to the point of vaudevillain proportions in the Netflix presentation.  Calanthe is a wonderful and magnificent figure, a queen who is fierce and protective, self-confident to the point of arrogance, and doomed because of her hubris because she loves too deeply.  Unlike Ciri, Calanathe is far more magnetic, believable, and identifiable because of her flawed humanity.  She has goals, she has passions, and she has strives towards them.  Played by the wonderful Jodhi May, Calanthe comes off the screen as a real figure, one I definitely wish I could read or watch more of.  I wanted to know more of her youth, her claw to the top of the hill, her drive to be the Lioness of Cintra.  I wanted to see her fight and love, her tempestuous courtship with Eist, and even though her initial regal image is later soiled with feet of clay as the story comes full circle, I found myself loving her all the more despite her mistakes.  But I have to ask, why do Hollywood directors keep killing of Jodhi May by having her leap from tall heights in beautiful scenes of suicide? -see [Last of the Mohicans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okGQj644_Ds)"")[/Spoiler] 

[Spoiler](/s ""Foltest:  They really had me unsure of this character at first, and I get the feeling that the version we see on screen is not nearly as fairly portrayed as I suspect the book would tell his tale.  I get the sense that this is a tragic character, one who was the victim of Greek Tragedy in what he and his sister knew was forbidden attraction, but that neither were able to escape.  The shows seems to try and paint over this with a greasy sheen of modern judgement, one which is not entirely appropriate given the place such sibling pairings had in Antiquity and even the Medieval period.  I was somewhat gratified Foltest brought his army at the end, although it seems it was too late to save many of the characters.  I do hope he is given a chance to display what I sense is deeply buried nobility in a flawed King."")[/Spoiler] 

[Spoiler](/s ""Renfry:  So again, I really really get the impression this character is more important to the overall saga than the brief amount of time we got with her was.  I also very liked her inner conflict over seeking revenge, versus the chance to just live and start fresh.  I can't fault her final decision, but I do mourn her passing within just one episode.  I want to know more about Stregabol and his Eclipse Girls.  I want to know more about if there really was something broken and wrong inside of Renfry.  I feel as if we only got half a story, and Renfry was never really allowed to fill in the other half.  I also have a weird theory and thought about if her tale is strongly related to Ciri's in the manner of prophecy.  I'll write a bit more about it below."")[/Spoiler] 

[Spoiler](/s ""The Concurrent Stories in Time:  This was a initially a bit of a surprise, albeit a pleasant one.   Coming from a family that appreciates international cinema, it's not secret that hard-cuts and time transitions are a commonplace storytelling device in Asian cinema, sometimes to the point where Western critics get really negative about the break in story-telling style.  I know it's been used in European cinema as well, particularly older French cinema.  However I was unsure at first, if it was a positive or a negative in the manner of its use in Netflix's series.  Ultimately I feel it was rewarding to watch through to the very conclusion of the season finale.  However, I had some very frustrating conversations with peers who watched the series and were utterly confused by the concurrent stories taking place outside of the same time sequence.  Some believed that certain characters were being portrayed as alternate universe versions, others were of the perception that time travel was involved.  From what I gather in seeing some of the posts here, it seems to have been a controversial decision amongst the viewers here too?"")[/Spoiler] 

[Spoiler](/s ""Daughters of Lilith/Eclipse Babies: So this is a half-question and a half-theory...  We know that Stregabol pursued and vivisected countless girls in the past who were potentially part of a prophecy, regarding the return of an elder demoness/goddess named Lilith (?).  However the show has been very stingy on providing details on this prophecy and the girls, showing us only Stregabol's obviously biased narrative.  But Renfry didn't deny any the accusations either, only saying she responded to events as a human would.  As a storyteller however, it feels odd that this story was chosen to begin the entire series with, and I have a sneaking suspicion that it is connected to the overriding motivations of the White Flame, of Nilfgard, and quite possibly with the daughter and granddaughter of Calanthe.  I wonder, and please do let me know if I am on the right track, if the eclipse and prophecy are connected to Ciri and Pavetta."")[/Spoiler]

# Chapter one

Wolf under rain

It was the wet season. For the past few months, the village of White Orchid had seen barely any rain but now, it came down in a continuous, relentless downpour. All were inside except for a group of four children that played in the puddles on the side of the muddy path. One of them looked up and saw a mounted figure slowly riding towards them.

‚ÄúLooky there!‚Äù he yelled to his friends, pointing in the direction of the stranger. The rest of the children stopped what they were doing and peered through the rain into the distance.

‚ÄúWho do you think it is?‚Äù one of the kids asked her friends. 

‚ÄúDunno‚Äù, replied another. ‚ÄúLooks like a soldier to me,‚Äù he continued.

As the stranger drew close they could make out certain details. He wore a black cloak over leather armour that was studded with what looked like silver. A satchel hung from his belt, made of plain brown leather and a  hood concealed most of his face, keeping it out of the rain. He wore a sword on his back and another was strapped to the saddle of his horse. But the children were most interested in the medallion that hung from his neck, it was silver with the head of a wolf engraved upon it. The stranger gently tugged his horses reigns stopping alongside the children. As he dismounted the kids saw how his movements were slow yet he seemed as if he was ready to spring into action at any moment. He dismounted his horse and turned to face the group.

‚ÄúDo you know where I can find Agnes?‚Äù he inquired. His voice was deep and composed yet lacking emotion.

‚ÄúDepends, sir,'' replied the oldest of the kids.

‚ÄúOn what?‚Äù asked the stranger.

‚ÄúWhat you want from her‚Äù. The stranger sighed to himself and produced a small bag of coins from his saddlebags.

‚ÄúYou see this?‚Äù he said, shaking the bag gently so that the sound of the coins clinking together carried over the roar of the rain. The children all nodded their heads slowly, their eyes fixed on the bag of money.

‚ÄúThis could be yours if you tell me where Agnes is‚Äô‚Äù he continued. There was silence for a moment which was broken by one of the kids who had not said a word since the stranger arrived.

‚ÄúI saw Agnes go into the tavern when it started raining,'' his voice was high pitched and squeaky. The stranger glanced in the direction of the inn, a building made of logs and a thatched roof. He turned back to the children and tossed the bag of coins at their feet.

‚ÄúPleasure doing business with you,'' he grunted as the children tore into the bag and started arguing amongst themselves how to split the money. The stranger mounted his horse and made his way to the tavern. 

# Chapter two

The contract 

As the stranger stepped into the inn the babble of voices was snuffed out as all turned in their seats to look at the new arrival. The inn was lit by candles and lamps giving it a warm, welcoming and comforting feeling. The tavern was nearly at full capacity as most folks had made their way here to seek shelter from the rain. He slowly removed his cloak and hung it on a hook as he walked by, his boots clunking upon the hard, wooden floor. With the hood gone the folk in the tavern could see his face. It was sharp and had defined lines, his hair was brown and shoulder length and a deep scar ran from the corner of his left eye down to his chin. but most peculiar of all he had bright yellow cat eyes. He surveyed the tavern before focusing on one woman who hadn‚Äôt turned to stare at him as he walked in. As he made his way towards her he was greeted by comments from the townsfolk,

‚ÄúFreak‚Äù

‚ÄúGet out of our inn witcher‚Äù

‚ÄúPlough off you whoreson‚Äù

The stranger ignored the comments and continued toward the woman.

‚ÄúYou Agnes?‚Äù he asked quietly.

‚ÄúDepends who's asking‚Äù‚Äô she replied coldly. She had a strong Skelligan accent, indicating she was a foreigner. 

‚ÄúAldrich of midcopse‚Äù, replied the stranger ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a witcher‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat in the blazes is a witcher?!‚Äù Agnes responded. A man from a neighbouring table leaned over.

‚ÄúWitchers are freaks, mutants‚Äù he spat, glaring at Aldrich. Aldrich returned a withering look of his own.

‚ÄúStay out of this‚Äù, the witcher growled. The man returned to his drink mumbling to himself. Aldrich turned back to Agnes.

‚ÄúWitchers are professional monster hunters, we go through mutations at a young age to enhance our senses, traits and capabilities.

‚ÄúWell, you're just what I need then‚Äù exclaimed Agnes. ‚ÄúI assume you‚Äôre here because of the notice I put up about the werewolf, it's been stealing our livestock and eating our supplies. I'm prepared to pay a hefty sum for the beasts head,‚Äù she explained to the witcher. 

‚ÄúIt hasn't killed anyone yet?‚Äù inquired Aldrich.

‚ÄúNot yet but it's only a matter of time‚Äù. Aldrich took a moment to think about the matter.

‚ÄúI can deal with the werewolf, provided you can pay‚Äù.

‚ÄúHow much do you want?‚Äù asked Agnes.

‚ÄúFour hundred‚Äù, stated the witcher.

‚ÄúBit much, how about three-fifty,‚Äù countered Agnes.

‚ÄúThree seventy-five, no less,‚Äù decided Aldrich.

‚ÄúThat I can do,‚Äù Agnes replied. 

‚ÄúWell then, tell me more about this werewolf.‚Äù

# Chapter three

Calm before the storm 

‚ÄúIt comes every couple of weeks, at night, killing a sheep or a cow or maybe someone's dog, the only signs of its visit is a set of paw prints, blood stains and the like‚Äù.

Aldrich nodded, taking mental notes on everything Agnes said. 

‚Äú werewolves are the result of a curse put upon someone, they are forced to live their life as a monster, they retain their consciousness but are overcome by an insatiable hunger for the flesh‚Äù, explained Aldrich, recalling the many lessons he had taken on werewolves at Kaer Morhen, a school for witchers. Agnes nodded her head and took a large swig of her mug of ale, obviously not very interested in what Alrich had to say.

‚ÄúWhen did the attacks start?‚Äù Aldrich asked. Agnes looked up from her drink

‚ÄúAbout three months ago‚Äù, she answered. Aldrich thought to himself for a moment and asked another question.

‚ÄúDo you know who could have placed the curse on this werewolf?‚Äù Agnes shifted uncomfortably in her seat at Aldrich's question.

‚ÄúDunno,‚Äù she said flatly. Alrich took note of her uncomfortableness on being asked about the beast. Aldrich stood up from his seat.

‚ÄúTake me to the most recent attack site,‚Äù he told her. Agnes nodded and gestured for the witcher to follow her. Agnes led Aldrich a fair way from the main cluster of buildings to a farm. The rain had died down to a drizzle and the ground had turned into thick mud that caked the boots of all who walked it. As they walked over a hill a small hut came into view, situated near fields of pasture that was grazed by cows. 

‚ÄúThis is my farm‚Äù, Agnes stated. 

# Chapter four 

The red rage 

‚ÄúRight here‚Äù, Agnes gestured to a spot on the ground. The grass was caked in dry blood and bent, indicating a corpse had laid there. Aldrich bent down to examine the spot while Agnes spoke.

‚ÄúCow went missing about four days ago, that's when I decided to put up the contract‚Äù.

‚ÄúHmm‚Äù, Aldrich responded bluntly.  He wiped up a piece of blood on his finger and sniffed it.

‚ÄúDefinitely cow blood‚Äù, he confirmed. The witcher glanced around the scene again using his superhuman eyesight that his mutations had granted him to see if he could pick up any irregularities. His eyes rested upon a tuft of grey hair. He bent down a picked it up, bringing it to eye level.

‚ÄúNot cow hair‚Äù, he stated. ‚ÄúCoarse and wiry.‚Äù Alrich bent down once more to examine the faint but visible tracks leading away from the scene of the killing. They were like dog prints yet they were elongated, Aldrich stood up and looked at Agnes.

‚ÄúYou always talk to yourself?‚Äù she inquired. Agnes sensed that the witcher would‚Äôve been blushing if his face wasn't so permanently pale. Aldrich ignored her question and whistled to his horse that had been grazing 40 meters away or so. 

‚ÄúI'm going to follow these tracks, hopefully they can lead me to the beast's lair, then i can lift the curse‚Äù, Aldrich told Agnes.

‚ÄúLift the curse?!‚Äù she said in shocked disbelief. ‚ÄúI hired you to kill the beast, not ploughing save it!‚Äù she exploded, her face turning red with anger. 

‚ÄúAs I said earlier,‚Äù Aldrich interrupted. ‚ÄúWerewolves are humans put under a curse, like a botchling or a wight, no matter what they look like or what they do under the effects of the curse, they are still people and deserve mercy‚Äù. Agnes sighed in disbelief.

‚ÄúI won't pay you‚Äù, she spat. The witcher nodded.

‚ÄúBut the cursed probably will‚Äù, he countered. Agnes spat at the witchers feet.

‚ÄúYou don't bloody know how important to me he dies!‚Äù she yelled, Agnes‚Äôs sudden outburst startled the birds roosting in a nearby oak tree as they flew up into the air Aldrich spoke.

‚ÄúSo it's a male‚Äù, he said to himself. ‚ÄúHow do you know this?‚Äù he asked Agnes, his tone of voice remained completely flat as to not anger the woman any further.  Agnes‚Äôs face turned red with rage once more.

‚ÄúI have god damn had it!‚Äù she screamed. Agnes turned around and stormed off to her cabin. Aldrich sighed, shook his head, mounted his horse and rode off in the direction of the werewolf prints..

# Chapter five

Of silver and steel 

The rain had completely stopped and the clouds that had once painted the sky a dark grey colour had completely dissipated. Aldrich heard the distinct sound of horse hooves upon the ground, he turned in his saddle to face the sound. 

‚Äú Hey, there witcher!‚Äù called out a jolly round face man, riding upon a shaggy unkempt horse.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Aldrich said coldly.

‚ÄúYou huntin‚Äô the beast that's been making off with our livestock?‚Äô Aldrich nodded.

‚ÄúI could take you to the whoresons‚Äô lair if you want, saw it slink away into it a few weeks back‚Äù, the man requested.

‚ÄúWhy not,‚Äù Aldrich turned back around to continue down the path as the unknown rider pulled alongside him

‚ÄúThing lives in a cave about five kilometres west from here‚Äù, he told Aldrich. The witcher simply nodded as the stranger pulled ahead of him to lead Aldrich to the lair. There were a few minutes of silence before the man spoke again.

‚ÄúSomething I always wondered about you witchers, why you got two swords?‚Äù he curiously inquired. Aldrich gestured to the sword that hung from his horses‚Äô saddle.

‚ÄúThis sword is made of silver, most monsters are extremely vulnerable to silver so this sword is what I use to slay them‚Äù, he explained in his emotionless voice. 

‚ÄúAnd the other sword?‚Äù the man asked, pointing to the one that Aldrich carried on his back.

‚ÄúThis sword‚Äù, Aldrich stated. ‚ÄúI use for the most wicked and evil monster around‚Äù. The man leaned towards the witcher with curiosity. 

‚ÄúWhat is this evil monster called?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúHumans,‚Äù Aldrich stated bluntly. The man chuckled a bit and continued leading the witcher to the lair of the monster. After about two hours of riding, the two men rounded a corner and what a sight awaited them. The gaping entrance of a cave was carved into the side of a hill like some ravenous maw. The ground surrounding the cave‚Äôs entrance was littered with the bones of various animals. Aldrich noted how there seemed to be no human remains, which was unusual, as most werewolves are overcome by unquenchable hunger and kill anything that moves, humans included. 

‚ÄúThis is as far as I can take ye‚Äù, the kind stranger nervously stuttered. ‚ÄúThis place creeps me the hell out‚Äù. He turned his horse around and swiftly rode off in the opposite direction. The witcher dismounted his horse and began to walk to the cave, scanning the area. The bones of various small animals crunched under Aldrich's heavy boots as he cautiously made his way deeper into the lair. 

# Chapter six

The tale of the beast

The cave was damp and dark, the thick stench of rotting meat wafted through the air. Alrich rounded a bend and there, standing in the corner of the large cavern, was the werewolf. It stood on its hind legs, hunched over, was about seven feet tall and covered in matted, grey, wiry hair. Its arms reached down past its waist and each of its fingers ended in a dagger-like claw. The beast's head was similar to that of a wolf, only the snout was slightly shorter, broader and covered in blood. The only thing remotely human about it was its eyes. They peered out from the beasts head like two polished sapphires. A cow carcass lay beside the beast, its belly ripped open and its slimy entrails spilled over the floor. The werewolf let out a low growl as it stood up straight to its full height.

‚ÄúI'm not here to hurt you‚Äù, Aldrich told the beast holding out his hands to show he was not holding a weapon.

‚ÄúThen why are you here‚Äù, the beast's voice was low and raspy and had a faint Skelligan accent. 

‚ÄúI want to lift your curse, but i need details on it‚Äù, Aldrich slowly walked towards the beast before taking a seat on a nearby rock. The werewolf relaxed a bit and sat down as well.

‚ÄúMy wife, Agnes cursed me‚Äù. Realisation suddenly dawned upon Aldrich. This was the reason why Agnes was so uncomfortable when asked who cursed the werewolf.

‚ÄúMy name is Eagan‚Äù, the beast told the witcher.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Aldrich of midcopse, a witcher.‚Äù Eagan nodded and continued his story.

‚ÄúA while ago when I was living on my farm with my son, David, Agnes went off to the city to buy supplies. A few days after she left a man visited us, he was burly and wore a dagger, engraved with a deer skull at his belt, he also had a deer skull tattooed on his cheek. He said if we gave him David for a week to work on his farm, which he said was about eight kilometers west of us, he would pay us handsomely. We were short on coin at the time so I accepted. A few days later Agnes returned and I told her about David, she lost her temper and told me to find him immediately. So I went west to look for the stranger's farm.‚Äù Eagan paused, scratched behind his ear and continued. 

‚ÄúI found the farm and searched all over for my David,‚Äù Eagans eyes started to water slightly as he reached this part of his tale.

‚Äú I eventually searched a farmhouse and when I went inside‚Ä¶‚Äù a single tear ran down the beasts cheek and slowly dripped onto the hard rock floor of the cave.

‚ÄúThere were chopped up pieces of young children everywhere, legs, arms intestines hanging on the wall like some sick decoration.‚Äù Aldrich had known some pretty horrid people but none had done anything as dastardly as this.

‚ÄúAnd there‚Ä¶‚Äù, Eagans beastly face took on a morbid look. ‚ÄúWas David, his decapitated head hanging from a meat hook.‚Äù Eagan completed his story and began to sob softly into one of his long, hairy arms. Aldrich awkwardly rested a hand upon the grief stricken werewolf.

‚ÄúYou don't have to continue,‚Äù he told Eagan. The beast wiped his eyes with his clawed hand and shook his head.

‚ÄúI must tell my tale,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúWhen i returned home to Agnes and told her what happened she grabbed a knife, slashed me and cursed me to be like this. I ran away and hid out in this cave, stealing food to survive‚Äù. Eagan concluded his story and sighed to himself. 

‚ÄúI can lift your curse‚Äù, Aldrich explained to the werewolf. ‚ÄúI will need that dagger Agnes used to curse you, I can bring it to you and bring you back to normal. However, it will only work if you want it to‚Äù. Eagan scoffed at the witcher.

‚ÄúOf course I bloody want it to work!‚Äù he said to Aldrich. Aldrich nodded and stood up from his rocky seat.

‚ÄúI'm off to pay Agnes a visit then.‚Äù

# Chapter seven

Foreshadowing 

The door to Agnes‚Äôs farmhouse creaked and Aldrich made his way inside. It was a small building, built of logs. Dried herbs hung from cupboards and a fire crackled at the back of the hut, providing warmth and light. A bed lay off to the side, embroidered with a stylized deer skull. Yet curiously, there was no sign of Agnes.

‚ÄúStrange‚Äù, Aldrich muttered to himself as he looked around to see if he could spot the dagger. The witcher searched the cupboards, draws and chests yet he could not find the dagger. As he opened the one cupboard he had not yet searched, a thick, long piece of rope fell out of it and onto the floor. Aldrich picked it up and looked it over. It was strong, the kind of rope used by executioners to hang people. 

‚ÄúInteresting‚Äù, Aldrich stated as he put the rope back in the cupboard. The witcher had almost given up hope of finding the dagger when he noticed one of the floorboards. It was lighter in colouring than the ones that surrounded it and was free of dust. Alrich bent down and tapped it lightly. The floorboard produced a hollow sound that resonated slightly through the house. Aldrich forced his fingers through the small gap that separated it from the board next to it. With a small pull, the piece of wood came loose from the floor, revealing a small compartment, and in it was an ornate dagger, stained crimson by dry blood. The witcher set the floorboard aside and picked up the dagger, examining its odd engravings of deer skulls that adorned the steel blade. He carefully put it in the satchel that hung from his belt and put the piece of the wood back where it was and exited Agnes‚Äôs house. The sun had begun to set, casting a warm orange glow across the sky as nocturnal animals like owls came out to hunt. Aldrich glanced at the orange sky before setting off to Eagan‚Äôs cave.

# Chapter eight 

To lift a curse 

Eagan lay down upon the cold, hard floor of his cave. He lifted his head as Aldrich entered, anticipation in his eyes. 

‚ÄúI found the dagger‚Äù, the witcher told Eagan, presenting the ornate dagger. A look of recognition was upon the werewolf‚Äôs face as he looked at the dagger, held in Aldrich's hands. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one,‚Äù Eagan remarked. Aldrich held the dagger out to the beast.

‚ÄúTake it‚Äù, he told Eagan. The werewolf gently took the dagger in his large, furry hands. There was a moment of silence before a golden glow engulfed Eagan, illuminating the cave in its light. The light slowly brightened to the point where Aldrich had to shield his eyes with his hand to protect them. Then, as gradually as it had brightened, the light died down, revealing a man in the werewolf‚Äôs place. He was thin and scraggly, clad in a ripped tunic and trousers, stained with muck and had bright orange hair and stubble. He looked himself over as if to make sure none of his body had been left behind in the transformation. His face changed from one of a surprise to pure joy.

‚ÄúThank you so much witcher!‚Äù he told Aldrich beaming with happiness. ‚ÄúI would hug you but I‚Äôm not exactly clear‚Äù, he continued, glancing at his filthy garments. 

‚ÄúNow we witchers don't work for free‚Äù, Aldrich explained. 

‚ÄúAh, of course, you saved me so you I owe you‚Äù, Eagan searched his pockets for a moment before an expression of guilt reached his face. ‚ÄúThing is‚Ä¶‚Äù Eagan told the witcher. ‚ÄúI don't have any coin on me at the moment‚Äù. Aldrich nodded.

‚ÄúYou can pay me once I return you home‚Äù, he explained.

‚ÄúTo Agnes?!‚Äù Eagan exploded in disbelief. 

To your wife Agnes, yes‚Äù, Aldrich responded. 

‚ÄúNot a chance‚Äù, Eagan said firmly, any trace of gratitude for the witcher was replaced with  stubbornness. 

‚ÄúYou're coming home or I'm going to drag you out myself,‚Äù Aldrich bitterly told Eagan.

‚ÄúBut she's the one who cursed me!‚Äù. 

‚ÄúWell maybe there's a chance of forgiveness, she most likely had an outburst of rage and acted in the heat of the moment‚Äù. Aldrich retaliated.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying she might regret cursing me? Eagan hopefully asked.

‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù, Aldrich bluntly answered.

‚ÄúI guess so, she may be as stubborn as a mule but she's still my wife‚Äù. Aldrich and Eagan exited the cave, night had fallen upon the land and the former werewolf couldn't see more then about four meters in front of him. The witcher, of course thanks to his cat eyes his mutations had granted him, could see fine. Aldrich led Eagan to his horse, and both men mounted up and began on their way back to Agnes‚Äôs farm. 

# Chapter Nine 

Blood under moonlight

The lights in Agnes‚Äôs cabin were on, the only illumination for a few kilometers around. The two men dismounted and made their way to the door. Aldrich gestured for Eagan to enter. Eagan took a moment to compose himself and knocked on the door with his fist. No answer. Eagan knocked again, and again there was only silence. Aldrich gently pushed Eagan aside and kicked the door. The door swung open and smashed into the wall, the sound carrying through the night air. Eagan and Aldrich stepped into the house, and there was Agnes, hanging from the rope Aldrich had found earlier. Her face had turned purple and a bruise ran along her neck where the thick rope cut into it. Blood slowly drizzled from her mouth as she gently swung from side to side like a pendulum. Eagan dropped to knees upon the hardwood floor as tears welled up in his eyes as he stared at his dead wife. Aldrich sighed and turned to leave.

‚Äúwait ‚Äú, Eagan broken heartedly, told the witcher. Eagan stood up and rummaged through a drawer and produced a small bag of coins. 

‚ÄúYour pay‚Äù, he bitterly said. Aldrich took the money and put it in his satchel.

‚ÄúI'm sorry‚Äù, he told Eagan. Eagan nodded as tears started to stream from his eyes.

‚ÄúLeave, there's nothing you can do now‚Äù, he dismissed the witcher and began rummaging through the house as if he was looking for something. Aldrich exited the house and shut the door behind him. He had not gone more than seventy meters when he heard a scream of pain from the house. The witcher instinctively turned and ran back to the house. He barged in without warning and surveyed the scene before his eyes. The soft moonlight illuminated a puddle of blood that stained the floor, in the puddle lay Eagan, his throat slit and in his hands was the very same dagger he had been cursed with. 

‚ÄúIronic‚Äù, Aldrich muttered before exiting Agnes‚Äôs house for the last time. 

# Epilogue

## The next morning... 

Aldrich took a hearty swig of the last few drops of mead left in his tankard. He set it down upon the taverns table and stood up to leave. Unbeknownst to him, a woman, clad in a long dark cloak stood up and slowly followed him out. As Aldrich mounted his horse and rode off in the crisp morning air, the woman mounted her own black mare and tailed the witcher, keeping her distance as she took out a long, deer skull engraved dagger and cleaned Eagans blood off the blade.",2,1582669890,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f9ilac/some_witcher_fan_fiction_i_wrote_constructive/,witcher,1

f9ik88,Xx_Mycartol_xX,Vilgefortz: was he really an antagonist? [Discussion],"So Vilgefortz was one of the biggest antagonists of last parts of saga. He was ""bad guy"", because he wanted to capture Ciri and use her to stop white frost and fulfilling the second part of prophecies which had told, that Ciri would bear ""destroyer"". He believed in elfen prophecies, which weren't believed by anyone, that's why he was found to be insane and Geralt wanted to stop him. Then Witcher killed him, Ciri was saved and that's in short the part we have in books.

Now from Witcher 3 we find out, that white frost was not just a tale, but the real threat. So Vilgefortz was right: divinations were real. Geralt was the one who killed one of the few people who could save the world and commitmed his friends for the good 2 people he cared about. There's second part of the divination yet, we will see how it will evolute. Well, it may look weird, but Geralt is the real bad guy then. 

What do you guys think about it?

Oh and there's Rience: antagonist as well. But he only was doing what he was told by Vilgefortz. The same as were soliders culprits of Slaughter of Cintra?

I‚Äôve tried to play titles like Skyrim and Fallout and enjoyed them, but never found myself pouring hours upon hours into them like some of my friends. The fantasy/knights in shining armor theme (which I thought is what this game was all about) never really appealed to me. But, I saw how highly regarded it was among the gaming community, so I decided to give it a shot. I am currently sitting drunk in my living room, crossing over my 100th hour of gameplay, and diving for loot in Skellige to get coin for grandmaster armor.

f9dnyl,4ThatWin,The witcher series,"Hi. I just recently started playing The witcher 3: Wild hunt and this has been probably the best experience ever. I just love the story, the charecters, everything. But... I am near the end of the game (COULD BE A SPOILER) (just after the battle with the wild hunt) and I just feel empty. It's probably because I hate when good games (for excample) end. I just don't know what to do after. (I have the two dlc's but they aren't that long.)

So I wanted to ask. I really would like to explore the witcher stories. Where should I ""start"" (because I already played the 3rd game)? Do I play the other two games (If so which one should I play first) or should I read the books or should I watch the netflix show (From what I have heard it is not the best? Or is it good?)

I would probably like to do all of it but... In what order should I do it? (And will my experience be worse if I play which one of the games and read the books at the same time)

I would really like to get a response about this because atm I very anxious even about finishing the game!!",10,1582651419,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f9dnyl/the_witcher_series/,witcher,1

My main question is how did it get back to Toussaint? Orianna says something about buying it from somebody a while ago, but that honestly felt like a cop-out answer to me but everybody just accepts it and we move on with the story. 

This is a national treasure of Toussaint, which goes missing for years and then somehow happens to wind up back in the capital, all in time to be stolen by one of Syanna's minions.

f95ep5,Aplusho1996,Gauter O‚ÄôDimm,"Just finished my Heart of Stone play through and man do I love Gaunter as a character. I eventually sided with him, because of how Olgeird treated Iris and his brother, and opting to never reveal what he did to the latter after all this time. To me that means deep down he felt some shame in what he did, and even though he has a heart of stone he still knows what he did was wrong but never sought to reconcile and chose to lie to his brother.

Moreover, as evil as the nature of O Dimm is, I can‚Äôt help but notice he is rather fair. He could have taken Olgeird‚Äôs soul or Geralt‚Äôs life at any moment if he had wished, nor is he forced to uphold the bargain he had with Geralt for his reward. He spared Geralt from forming a pact by asking for his true nature when he could have easily bound Geralt to another pact. To me he really does seem like a merchant. He sells everything and anything you want, but at a price you may not be ready to pay. 

Although his initials spell out G.O.D, I think his name also resembles ‚ÄúHaunter of Dim/Dimmed‚Äù. He preys on fools and the dimmed who would make deals lightly with him, and it‚Äôs their souls who he will take. Perhaps a mage or someone wittier would be able to fool him more easily, but then they would probably be smart enough not to enter into a pact with him in the first place.",19,1582608833,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f95ep5/gauter_odimm/,witcher,1

f94ovm,Goofiestchief,"I wish ""white voice singing"" and female vocals like in the Witcher 3 were more common in western gaming soundtracks","I feel like when it comes to western games and their soundtracks (mainly the ones that use vocals a lot), the ""crescendo moment"" in the more ""epic"" tracks are usually going to include one of two things or both: 

1. A chorus where extra voices (or voices in general) start joining into a melody 
2. Deep voiced chanting with deep male voices as the primary singers

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTsD2FjmLsw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTsD2FjmLsw) 

This track is a good example of number one as a choir joins in at around 3:20 to chant a melody that has up to this point been repeated mainly instrumentally throughout the piece. Other games like the souls games and gears of war also have tracks that follow this pattern. 

A couple games exhibit number two from Skyrim to Halo to God of War as well as number one. 

Now I'm not in anyway criticizing these soundtracks. These are actually some of my favorite game soundtracks ever. That's why I picked them because I remember them so well. I would be annoyed if these particular soundtracks went a different direction from what they are. I do not want this taken away, I simply want more of something else that I feel hasn't been used enough. 

A lot of these choirs usually have two combinations: 

1. Only male voices (the deeper the better)
2. A combination of male and female. 

I don't see a lot of female only vocalizations though in western soundtracks and I never really realized the untapped potential of that until after I played the Witcher 3 and was introduced to it's soundtrack done by the folk band Percival and the concept of ""white voice singing"" which emphasizes singing with a open throat almost like a scream. Since it's similar to screaming, it has a little bit of a constant rise to it since the airway is meant to be fully open. 

I used to think you didn't hear a lot of female only high vocals because female voices were more meant for invoking feelings of beauty or sadness which would usually find little room in your average game soundtrack where more bombastic and dramatic, hyped up, moments were more essential since you're usually killing something in these games.  

Suddenly, I realized just how much range ""white voice singing"" offered beyond just simply being ""dramatic"" and this was especially so in more high pitch voices sung by women. They invoked a higher range of emotions, at least for me. 

They could be fast paced:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCAnW11ZmwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCAnW11ZmwM) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDnENTDuAiI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDnENTDuAiI) 

They could be rising and dramatic:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkkt5X\_ydmI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkkt5X_ydmI) 

They could be creepy:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TklqSdZCeM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TklqSdZCeM) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TklqSdZCeM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TklqSdZCeM) 

They could be slow and beautiful:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NknjE2SBPxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NknjE2SBPxw) 

A constant rise in the voice with an open throat is still present in each of these diverse tracks though and you're usually going to get a higher pitch from female voices compared to male voices. 

White voice isn't as common in the western world since it originates from eastern European cultures but the Witcher 3 is mainstream now and I would like to see more of this in other games.",2,1582605306,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f94ovm/i_wish_white_voice_singing_and_female_vocals_like/,witcher,1

f8x2yy,alexander_london,Latecomer to Blood and Wine - I think the best DLC in Video Game History,"I'm very late to the Witcher 3 but have quietly played through almost the whole game over the course of 5 months. I'm almost at the end of Blood and Wine. I have to say, I'm on the edge of my seat with this DLC. The writing is fantastic, the landscapes are beautiful, the soundtrack is triumphant, the content is deep, the characters three-dimensional and I really feel like the game reaches its peak towards the end.

f8twwf,SteelEpoch,TIP: Mute The Witcher 3's music if you want to have a whole new experience,"I think everybody who has been playing this game for a longer time knows that it's frequent soundtracks like ""The fields of Ard Skellig"" or that one Velen Soundtrack (you know which one I'm talking about) can get a bit repetitive, since they play most of the time in a noticeable loop. They are without a doubt great soundtracks, but if you are hearing the same loop for the 50th time it's just nothing special anymore.

So I decided to see what happens when I mute the music in the audio settings, and I was honestly blown away. The ambient sounds in this game are phenomenal, and when I closed my eyes I could perfectly picture standing in the middle of a forest. I can't describe it as well as it deserves, so just see (or listen) for yourself. Travelling simply felt infinitely more immersive and meaningful, and fighting felt a lot more realistic. The whole thing works best in Velen and Skellige, but the other areas are great for that too.

A bit bummed that the journey is already over I mean!

Don't get me wrong I did really enjoy all the books, 7 normal-sized novels is no small feat for a single writer, and Peter Kenny's narration is also nothing short of amazing. It's just that playing through Witcher 3 I always assumed the game is largely adapted from the books. Now that I'm done with both I realised most of the world, its stories and characters and monsters in it, all the nuances and details I have in my head, most of it is actually crafted by CDPR instead of Sapkowski. The game contains so much stuff that isn't in the books at all or is mentioned only in passing. And I haven't even played W2 or W1 yet!

f8q6xu,Ryabchick,Is Netflix serial really bad or not?,"First of all, it‚Äôs annoying to see black representatives of different races, not humans: they are fine. Well, the biggest idiotism is having black elves in this serial. But now it‚Äôs obvious: there are no black elves in the serial, only half-elves, kids of a black human and a pure blooded elf. From this point, now it doesn‚Äôt look that ridiculous. As about having black Eithne: reading a book, you imagine high and handsome queen with white hairs, who doesn‚Äôt speak that much. You understand that she is on a proper place, behaving how she should: she is wise, fair and stern. Ideal variant. In the serial: WASUP HOMIES? Just annoying.

Not that important, but still: why so much attention for young Yen? She must look like she is 40 y o with fresh skin of 18 y o girl. And she definitely must be colder towards everybody, especially Geralt. So she should be more mature. And also, there was a scene where she was fighting with a sword. REALLY? ARE YOU SERIOUS? Are you just lazy to make a scene, where she uses magic, not that s\*it? I am not sure that in Aretusa apprentices are taught to use weapons. 

Another annoying point: Ciri. Why is she so slow and passive? Reading a book you imagine vivid girl, with her manners like she is a princess, everybody should respect her, she is so young yet she feels like she is a centre of the Universe. Sometimes on a place of Geralt I would kick her ass for her attitude towards everybody.

Very controversial moments, when they change the plot, breaking some facts. For example, when doppler fought a real person. Ehm, these creatures CANT hurt others, they just don‚Äôt understand such bad feature of a human nature as cruelty. Speaking about dopplers it comes exactly to plot twist, when a druid got killed and got a replacement. Well, tbh it doesn‚Äôt really a great change, still, don‚Äôt think it was that necessary. 

Changing the dragon fight, I don‚Äôt think they should have done in that way. Do they think that people wouldn‚Äôt understand that turmoil, which was in the book? They could make cute little dragon, real dragon fight, that duel between a knight and a dragon. It would be better. And here Zerricans cannot be unmentioned. THEY DON‚ÄôT SPEAK COMMON LANGUAGE, WHO GAVE THEM VOICE, IS THAT YOUR DAMNED TOLERATION? Do they think that it would be wrong having 2 voiceless scarecrows walking along with that knight. Come on. And also in this story: dwarfs don‚Äôt usually make mixed group, as I know. It consists only of dwarfs and gnomes. But there was a black halfling. Looked like: ‚Äúman, we have to keep in mind that number, that there must be 5-10% of black people, so lets just kick him in. Leave him how he really looks like, without any changes‚Äù. Funny and stupid.

Striga. There was a little bit different fight. Well in the first game they made it exactly how it was in the book. That variant would be better. But, eh, it‚Äôs OK I guess. And one fact: Foltest wasn‚Äôt ashamed of his incest, he loved his sister. But incest is bad, love is good yes, but according to standarts, first goes moral, love is not that sacred. 

And also, I remember someone said that there was no racism in the book. No, it was there :D There was even special taxes for representatives of different races, so racism ,from some point, was even highlighted by legislation.

Finally, meeting with Ciri. They made it bad. I had goosebumps, when I was reading the book. Geralt left Ciri in Brokilon, she was running after him, crying. But he left her anyway. Then he rescued a man and declared him that he had to give him, what he doesnt expect to find at home. And that unexpected child, who was orphaned was Ciri. Damn, that was extremely touching to imagine. This whole sequence is just outstanding. 

Summing up, I can say there to many flaws in the serial.This adaptation could be better, if the whole cast was Slavic or at least Slavic looking. F&amp;ck your tolerance, f&amp;ck your imagination, you have ruined a great part of this world. But if I didn‚Äôt know the book, didn‚Äôt imagine that world, I wouldn‚Äôt pay so much attention to some facts. But from this point, its, well, just OK, 5-6 out of 10. With changed cast and without knowing true story it would have been easily 9 out of 10. But ‚ÄúSUCK IT‚Äù says Alik Saharov or whoever responsible for these mistakes I‚Äôve mentioned. And if they make Francesca Findabair black, or any other elf sorceress black, it will be just a shot in a head (i didnt pay too much attention to it, probably they were shown in the serial). 

And last. If someone thinks that Henry is the only person, who can play Geralt. No, he is not. Mihal Jebrowskiy was good in the role of the famous witcher. Polish version is closer to original.

f8opc1,TeflonGoon,I finished it! (Only took 5 years),"Five years, two platforms, and 90+ hours later, I've completed The Witcher 3. I first bought the game in 2015 for the PS4. I probably played less than 20 hours. I found it hard to get into and other games took priority and I never returned to it on console. 

Some years later...  

I upgraded my PC for gaming and grabbed the W3 GOTY edition in 2018. I quickly put 35 hours into the game (a lot of side quests). Then life got busy and it went back on the proverbial shelf.  

I picked it up again at the start of 2020, determined to finish the main story, and put another 35-40 hours into it. Today I completed the main story.  

I'm not a big fan of fantasy (games, books, or movies) but I loved this game. The game is beautiful, etc., etc., but I'm really blown away by how much work went into WRITING and planning this game. The the dialogue, the letters, the books, the notice boards, the notes, the recipes, etc., etc., etc. Incredible.

f8ilqr,secondchance4now,Is there any story reason to kill the sentient monsters in the games? [SPOILERS for all 3 games],"Not really focused on The Witcher 1 since I'm not going to replay it, but I remember that werewolf was actually Vincent and I think there's a sentient alghoul in Act 1.

In The Witcher 2, there's the troll in Flotsam, and a succubus on Iorveth's path (probably something on Roche's path too, still playing it and will see). Then of course Saskia the dragon in Act 3, if you follow Iorveth's path (how you find out Saskia is the dragon).

In The Witcher 3, there's 2 succubi, the one in Novigard (who works as a prostitute) and the one in Skellige. Then there's the doppler, a bunch of troll encounters, etc.

I suppose you get rewards for killing those monsters, in TW3 you can make decoctions from harvest their corpses. But story-wise, is there any reason for Geralt to kill them?

How do I play the game mostly encountering things I'm actually able to fight? 

Example: there is a question mark left of oxenfurt that has level 6 drowners guarding a corpose. The mark is labeled "" hidden treasure"". Looting the corpse (glowing red) gives you a note and key, and prompts a guest. If you track the quest, it tells you to follow the blood trail.

f8fb4x,1basicwitch,"In the books, is there sexual interest from Ciri towards Geralt?","Hello everyone,

I have jumped on the Netflix hype train and watched the series.Afterwards I decided to give the books a shot, read two prequels and now started with the first ""official"" book of the series. After finishing it I am a bit confused and uncertain if I want to continue reading. Main reason is, I am unclear if Ciri has sexual interest in Geralt in the books. And I simply have no interest in that! ( I enjoyed the father-daugther chemistry in the series, especially as she is 13-ish) And quite frankly, I felt like there was jealousy from Ciri towards other women in Geralts life and it was never made clear, if it was out of fear of losing her father figure, or her well... yeah.

So if someone can pls. let me know how Ciri views Geralt in the books, so that I know if I want to continue the series or not, that would be awesome. Thank you!No plot spoilers though, please =)

Edit:  
Seeing the answer is an overwhelmingly NO I will continue to read the series. And also worry how I got this weird vibe from the story.",11,1582489727,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f8fb4x/in_the_books_is_there_sexual_interest_from_ciri/,witcher,0

f8d8x6,thesarahhirsch,I just finished the novels. I need to talk to people (about the ending and other stuff). Here there be spoilers...,"Hello everyone. I just mainlined the Witcher novels and am now emotionally compromised by the ending.  But I also have some questions. 

Do you think they keep saying that death follows Ciri because she accidentally brings over the ""Red Death"" from another world? I like this interpretation better than her just being cursed to bring about the deaths of the ones she cares about. 

I was pretty stricken by the end, for obvious reasons, thinking maybe the whole story was just within a framing device for the knight she was talking to, but now I'm not so sure. There are entire chapters outside of this framing device, like Nimue and Jarre's chapters. There are places within parts of the story where Ciri is present where Geralt experiences things that Ciri is not privy to, like where Geralt talks to Emher and the emperor lays out his Bond villain plan. Ciri doesn't seem to know anything about this discussion, and Geralt swears not to tell her because it would only hurt her. This suggests to me that rather than being Ciri's version of events as told to the knight, this stuff is fairly factual and leads me to believe that Geralt really DOES end up waking up with Yennefer somewhere safe.

There's other stuff I'd like to talk about, but I'm fairly emotionally compromised at the moment. I'm fighting a whole ""is there justice or no justice"" fight with myself in regards to the end. What do you guys think?

I really enjoyed the Book Ciri and the amount of sheer innocence she has, and the way in which she reacts to situations around her. Sure in the show she is exposed to traumatizing shit pretty early, but even then she seems too composed and old.

I guess it is challenging with an older actress portraying her. But there is something more compelling about book Ciri in her desire to be a woman but, almost in a childish way.

BUT, whilst playing it, it made me think. What if this was set in the Witcher world? 

- A huge map? Awesome! 
- Endless quests? Yes please.
- The ability to create your own quests and then share them with the community? Oh my god this would be so cool. If you could create scent trails, build elaborate puzzles etc. I‚Äôd keep playing and playing and playing. 
- especially if you could create quests with crazy monsters at the end - maybe even generic NPCs to be communicated with. Holy crap it‚Äôd be amazing.
- more and more DLC‚Äôs expanding on the story? Hell yeah.

I think AC Odyssey &amp; other games were influenced by Witcher 3. If Witcher 4 comes out they could definitely do well by taking the best bits from AC Odyssey (and perhaps other games too)

f89cqm,meewunk,Are the first two Witcher games worth it?,"I bought the entire trilogy in a bundle with the intention of playing them in order. This didn't happen as I found the controls for the first one to be VERY clunky and hard to get comfortable with. A friend said to not even bother and go straight to 3, so I did.

I finished 3 and felt I should go back and try 1 again because I'm a little obsessive. I got further after switching to keyboard + mouse for controls and have gotten further.

But it's exhausting! I feel like I have to do so much to achieve not a whole lot. The combat is odd, I'm not always clear on what's going on with some of the notifications and controls. The menus are weird, I hate having to pause constantly, I could go on. 

I know a lot of this is because it's the original/first game and it's older and that's just what happens sometimes (looking at you Mass Effect) but I need to know if it's worth it to push through and keep going. I don't get a ton of time to play games so I'd rather spend my time on something that isn't a struggle.

It feels like 3 referenced a lot of neat stuff that I want to experience! However I am reading the books as well so if it's stuff I'll find out there I might just not bother, unless y'all can convince me otherwise.",31,1582464037,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f89cqm/are_the_first_two_witcher_games_worth_it/,witcher,1

f86m4v,TheMaltazar,A question about Ciri's connection to Falka,"I am currently reading through Baptism of fire and i got to the part where the lodge explains Ciri's family tree and connection to the elder blood and Falka. They explain that Feiona and Amavet were Rianon children and Adela was Falka's child that she had planted with them. Then Rianon gene had been split between her children  and subsequently passed down until it reformed in Calanthe and then in Pavetta and Ciri. 

 Then i went back and checked in time of contempt where in Ciri's dream she sees Fenn and  Codringher come to the conclusion that it was Fiona, not Adela, that was Falka's daughter. And later Ciri sees Falka in the fire calling her to draw the power and bring destruction which reinforces Fenn and Cod's conclusion.

So if Fiona is Falka's, making Ciri a descendant of Falka, how is it that Rianon's gene reformed in Calanthe?

* Keep playing on DM and not even get the achievement for it
* Play on boring blood and broken bones
* Restart on DM with NG+

f7w5mk,PM_ME_DARK_SECRETS,Game feels a bit flat (no spoilers please),"Been playing for a bit and mostly enjoying it but have started to feel like the gameplay is stale. I‚Äôm level 14 and at this point have felt like the crossbow, and to a lesser extent grenades, are a bit useless. As a result combat is a little dull since every battle boils down to using a sign, slashing, dodge, repeat. I wish that you could have more than 1 sign bound to the controller at once - I know I could be swapping signs more but it feels somewhat pointless.     
    
Additionally, the gear upgrades are so small that it‚Äôs barely noticeable. At first I‚Äôd spend time trying to find the materials for gear to craft it but then I‚Äôd notice its barely an upgrade and often a side grade. On top of that, you can‚Äôt really tell the difference when you‚Äôve got new gear on with the exception of huge weapon upgrades.

f7v7rs,jacob1342,Next Witcher game would work better as a prequel instead of a sequel.,"Wild Hunt did amazing job with closing Geralt's and Ciri's story. The world from the books was used perfectly in whole trilogy. But the world left after Wild Hunt story took away many amazing characters and left this world more empty. Starting with rich political side that was main focus of Witcher 2 and huge background for Witcher 3 came down just to one ruler of the whole continent. 

CDPR already showed that they can tell their original stories set during books' events with Thronebreaker where we are able to visit Mahakam for example, and see Geralt knighted as Geralt of Rivia. Those who played know what Im talking about. Those who didnt... there is still amazing story ahead of you. 

Making another game as a prequel would allow to use the richness of Witcher books again. There would be a chance to see Geralt again. And maybe Ciri too. But this time as side characters. I mean, books basically left 4 witchers with blank page just waiting for CDPR to use them in another amazing stories. We have Lambert, Eskel, Vesemir and my personal pick for prequel, Coen. Most of you probably dont know him and thats the reason. In the books he had similar amount of ""content"" to any other witcher but he is the only one who CDPR couldnt expand.

I imagine new series could start before Geralt brought Ciri first time to Kaer Morhen and she started her training. These events could be later presented anyway, from different pov. Also picking Coen as main protagonist would allow to show Battle of Brenna. I just mentioned events from 1st and 5th saga books. Between these 2 there is whole blank page for these characters that would make enough material for another trilogy.",70,1582390786,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f7v7rs/next_witcher_game_would_work_better_as_a_prequel/,witcher,1

f7uvzx,Lovehardt,"Curses are the best type of Witcher Contracts in The Witcher 3, and no one can convince me otherwise.","[Spoilers for Witcher Contracts including those involved in DLC]


Just finished the quest ‚Äò‚Äô and I‚Äôve come to the realization that quests involving the lifting of curses are some of the best this game has to offer. 

I often find myself finishing Witcher contracts rather unmoved or mildly entertained by what there is to learn about monsters I‚Äôve already familiarized myself with. I don‚Äôt really blame the developers for this. There‚Äôs only so many was you can write around monsters in this game that aren‚Äôt sentient, but some of my favorite quests *are* those involving ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù that are more on the sentient side. I must say though that curses are an entirely different animal. 

I get a sort of anxiety whenever I‚Äôm tasked to lift a curse in this game because there is so much that can potentially go wrong, and this risk often creates a greater sense of urgency that I don‚Äôt feel when dealing with other Witcher contracts. (Unpopular opinion, but I simply don‚Äôt care as much about killing trolls, succubi, and dopplers despite liking them)

The introduction to the situation involving the Baron‚Äôs wife and deceased child is probably only bested by the impact that Olgierd‚Äôs Iris had on me. That exchange was just simply heartbreaking. And if you‚Äôll allow me to count it as a curse, solving Gaunter O‚ÄôDims riddle actually had tremendous weight behind it because Geralt‚Äôs morality put his and another‚Äôs life as risk in a way that general contracts just don‚Äôt do. 

Let me know how other curse related contracts made you feel in this game!",5,1582389417,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f7uvzx/curses_are_the_best_type_of_witcher_contracts_in/,witcher,1

After about 100 hours, I've just finished the main story of The Witcher 3. I'm listening to the credits as I type this.

I had heard about the multiple endings; I knew of the nature of the 3. Upon learning they existed, I immediately turned away. I wanted the best ending, but wanted to get it my way.

When Ciri went into the land of the White Frost and those happy memories played, I thought that was it. When Geralt told ~~Tywin Lannister~~ Emhyr var Emeris that Ciri was dead, I nearly burst into tears. I tried so hard to let Ciri just be free, and I had failed. Ciri was dead.

f7eyab,Dantibus,Should I get The Witcher 3 on the switch or give PS4 version another try?,"At first I wasn't very interested in the switch version but after seeing update 3.6 it's gotten my attention. I had first bought the PS4 version way back when it came out but I wasn't really into it at the time. Now though I've gotten more into the fantasy and rpg scene and after watching the Witcher on netflix I remembered the game was a thing. Now being more interested in the Witcher franchise I decided to give this game another chance but I've been debating whether I want to get it on the switch. The big reason is because I find it way easier to play longer type games on a portable device rather then to have to sit in front of my tv for long periods of time. What worries me though is that one of my biggest turn offs about the ps4 version was how choppy it ran for me. When I first played it, it was only out for a couple months so if it's been patched I wouldn't know, but I played it on a base PS4 and the performance seemed really bad running for what im pretty certain was less than 30 fps the entire time. At this point I have a PS4 pro, I feel like with the pro and whatever update/patches it might have it may be a better experience but im still not sure I could sit in front of my tv for long periods of time. What do you guys think?

f7b7pu,F3n1x_ESP,Is Jaskier a bad singer in the books?,"When the Netflix show aired we got to see Joey Batey perform a Jaskier with an excellent and polished voice, and even his infamous ""Toss a coin to your witcher"", being horrific, is sung with excellent taste. But the spanish version, well, let's just say that they should have picked a dubber that actually knew how to sing. But now I'm seeing comments of people actually defending this, since they state that **in the books Jaskier is a bad singer**. 

I've read the books years ago as soon as they got translated to my language (spanish).  I've also played all three games, and I don't remember reading that Jaskier was a bad singer. He was recognized and also revered even by elves (not by the Scoia'tael, but those critics can be dismissed as biased).

So, can anybody point me a passage from the books where it is clearly stated that Jaskier can't sing?",16,1582292353,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f7b7pu/is_jaskier_a_bad_singer_in_the_books/,witcher,1

Man they should have had cirri go down on this guy if you choose this route. I don't care if we see it or not its just to give Skjall a good god damn reason to go through all of the hell he has to suffer through later. Being severely wounded, erased from the record, savagely ripped apart by Morkvarg, and then being brought back to life to be tortured . . . I mean *interrogated*.  For Freya's sake all he did was have a crush on her and be a good person. Burying him isn't enough in my mind since with the other people we see suffering or murdered we avenge them or help end their suffering.  But with him we really can't since the people that fucked him over were Ciri, avallac'h and his own people

&amp;#x200B;

I know this may be a minority preference.  I remember the most popular class in mass effect was the standard, run and gun soldier.  Not the adept, essentially a space jedi that could explode things with their mind, the class that could literally be played in the real world, that picks up a gun and goes bang bang.  In a similar vein, the visceral desire of many gamers in fantasy games is to play the tough warrior, swinging a sword, severing limbs, or stabbing people in the back.

&amp;#x200B;

In xmen, wolverine is one of the most popular characters, but again, I always gravitated to people with more... exotic powers that came across as REAL power to move whole mountains.

f70m05,Kusetsu-Senpai,I just don't get how people like this show,"Let me start by saying...

The witcher universe is one of my favorite fantasy settings of all time. The witcher 3 Is ranking top 3 of my favorite games of all times and it is the only ever game i bothered embracing myself in the lore and reading everything about it. Even tho i haven't read the books i have watched several Videos about the Lore and i am not justa complete witcher newbie here to complain, but a fan who wants to express his disappointment

So what im trying to say is i don't have a grudge against the franchise at all and actually i was really hyped about the show coming up. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what is my problem with the show? 

First up i say what i actually liked about the show 

\- The attack of Nilfgaard against Cinfrid was pretty epic and had fantastic special effects if you ask me

\- They kept to the books and not to the games for character design (for example triss doesn't have fire red hair)

\- I really liked how Henry Cavill tried to connect to the role of geralt and actually catched up alot of knowledge about the series and did a very good job playing geralt

\- Jaskier :)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That being said lets go into the actual complains i have

\- The timelane is confusing. I like the idea of them having seperate stories which come together at the end as geralts, yennefers and ciris connection is one of the most vital parts of the entire franchise and it's a cool idea showing how they are bound to be together. But lets face it, the way they did it was GARBAGE. They didn't bother in the slightest to give any clue as to whats going on with the timeline until the very end and this is not just personal opinion but a fact. There are several popular posts and videos about the confusing timeline. 

\- Fringilla is black. Now before the SJW's come at me and label me a complete racist and value everythign i said until now as invalid let me explain. The witcher is based on slavic folklore and the setting is clearly european medieval fantasy. It is so damn obvious you really don't have to think about it. European folklore, dragons, architecture, dialect (in some cases), clothing, weapons, armor, animals... And they established everything to fit with the setting. So they did with the peoples skin colors. Pretty much everything we ever saw were fair skinned people, except for the Nazair people. And there i think it is pretty obvious that it isn't just random. They perfectly fit in the european history setting as the equivelant North african Mamluk turks (google it). They Not only wear inspired clothes and weapons but also are the ones who sell exotic goods and wares just like the mamluks did in real life serving as middle man between indian and chinese maritime trade to europe. And besides that the other very big reason because this doesn't make any sense is that they already established her with white skin color in the games. 

And now if you really think that i just hate black people for some stupid reason you wanna make up i got one last thing i wanna say. Imagine you watch a doku about the second world war, and every german Person would be played by a black person and every russian person by han chinese. It would feel undeniably out of place and confusing and make no sense and this is just the same thing.

As for her acting i don't have anything special to say. The cast seemed pretty mediocre overall. The actress playing Yennefer barely managed to put in any emotion at all into her acting and it pisses me off how disinterested she seemed about the show all around but enough about that.

\- The monsters look like absolute garbage. They used CGI instead of creating real skeletons or costumes or really anything. It is so damn saddening how terrible they look. It's just obvious they didn't give a shit. The thing, a horror movie 38 years old has better looking monsters than this piece of shit. And if you wanna tell me the thing has worse looking monsters the only thing you could point out is the resolution being smaller at the time.

\-It's so Cliche. Geralts Macho look in the face of death attitude (when he is kidnapped you know), The ""lets talk around the point"" conversation style, The starting scene where he only barely escapes death and he misses grabing his sword like 10 times, the ""im too damn cool to wash off my COMPLETLY top to bottom in organs and blood covered body in the next pond or river i can find"" attitude and the last thing i remember right now the fight with the striga where the MONSTER EXPERT AKA WITCHER doesn't fu\*\*ing think about that the strige may still be alive and attack him.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you ask me the witcher show is a great disappointment for the franchise and just plain overhyped. It has no quality in setting, story, actors (partially), character design or monster design

Will i watch Season 2? Obviously, that i don't like season 1 doesn't mean i hate the entire franchise, but i have very low hopes for it being any better seeing how this crap that dares be named ""witcher"" is without any proper reasons upvoted into oblivion.

f6ym1q,Fassbenderr,Netflix Series Rant: some of you are as entitled as Star Wars fans.,"I was just scrolling on YouTube, consuming my daily Witcher content, when I see a post from a popular Witcher Youtuber, criticizing the race changes in the show, and sparking up hate in regards to it.

Why is this such a big deal that some character have changed in their depiction, even when Sapkowski himself doesn‚Äôt explicitly mention race for a lot of the characters?

Why are you so entitled to something you simply consume, meanwhile we have the privilege of a fairly entertaining show, even if it‚Äôs far different from the books?

I‚Äôm sick of hearing people claim how unrealistic it is to have colored people in a series about dragons, elves, and other monsters. It‚Äôs a sad reflection of the book itself, which directly criticizes that way of thinking.

Don‚Äôt like that they made Fringilla black? Boo hoo. I don‚Äôt like that Vilgefortz had to throw a fight with Cahir, but I won‚Äôt scream outrage like some of you are over these very, very insignificant differences.

Make your all white Witcher series with what little coins you have, and outdo Netflix. But please, shut the fuck up. Creative liberties shouldn‚Äôt hurt your feelings or identity. Live with it, or keep your head in the books.

For me personally, I'd have to say its the following.

1. After clearing all the missions of Skellige, and leaving just The Last Wish on a Yennefer Romance, knowing that Kaer Morhen is just ahead.
2. Finishing the initial grind in Velen, leaving the final elements of the Baron Story, and Novigrad open
3. At Isle of Mists, just before I enter the hut, meeting Ciri and then leaving for the first big showdown with the Hunt.

For the DLC:

1. Returning to Olgierd after defeating the Ofieri and meeting G.o.D
2. Just before mission for the rose, and the endgame for the story

In Blood and Wine:

1. After completing all the secondary quests in Toussaint, but before I've met Regis at the Cemetary, leaving the entire story ahead.

f6w3kc,i_karamazov,Witcher 3 Death March: An Alchemy Build Guide,"#**Intro**    


I have been replaying this amazing game on Death March and I believe have hit on a build that is both insanely fun and very effective.  Now I know I am probably not the first to have this build nor am I claiming anything new or revolutionary here, but what I want to do is hopefully get people excited to try Death March on an alchemy heavy build.  My first play through of the Witcher 3 had me completely ignore all things alchemy ‚Äì I played on normal difficulty and didn‚Äôt use potions, oils, bombs or decoctions.  Combat and a few sign skills had me breezing through.  I didn‚Äôt even realize what I was missing, but after trying out DM and being forced to utilize all the tools in Geralt‚Äôs box, I was astonished how much more fun and engaging this game can be.   What was the point of Geralt going through the Trail of the Grasses if you don‚Äôt take advantage of the potions and decoctions that are so powerful they would kill an ordinary man?    


#**A Note on Alchemy**    


Once you have brewed/created any alchemy item in the game, you replenish the item every time you and only by meditating.  This includes decoctions.  Oils never deplete.  Hard alcohol (alcohest and drawven spirit are the big 2) is the only ingredient used to replenish all alchemy items after meditation and is plentiful in-world.  This effectively means that you have an unlimited supply of all alchemy items, all you have to do is meditate and your stock will be replenished.  As soon as you obtain a diagram and have the ingredients, you should be crafting ALL alchemy items, since once created you will have them for the rest of the game.  Prioritize finding ingredients for the diagrams you have.  My first play through, I didn‚Äôt realize this was also true for decoctions, and so held off creating many of them as I thought they were only single use.  This is not so.  Once created, you can use a decoction once after every meditation.  This is no issue as you will be meditating quite often on your alchemy heavy build.  Last quick point ‚Äì potions may seem to expire too quick (20 or 30 seconds) but these are extended as you upgrade the potion to enhanced and superior versions, and every skill point you invest in alchemy increases potion length by 5%.  Very quickly you will be doubling the length of potions.  Decoctions are also extended by 5% with each ability point invested.  Generally, the amount replenished also increases by 1 as you upgrade the potion.   For example, you have 3 regular Swallows for each mediation, 4 Enhanced Swallows, and 5 Superior Swallows in between each mediation.  Decoctions stay at 1 use per meditation, but will quickly last the entire length between your mediations.    


#**The Build:  Step 1**    


Now, onto the build.  The build itself will start with a core of basic skills every witcher will need in order to succeed, especially on DM.  You can get these in any order for the first 3 slots, but this is what I suggest.  First, School of the Cat technique on the general skill slot.  100% critical hit increase as well as the flat 20% increase in fast attacks is a no brainer.  This will immediately make things easier for you as DM is notoriously hard in the early levels.  Next, go for 5/5 Muscle Memory.  Again, another permanent 25% increase in fast attacks.  Lastly, you need to invest in Quen.  3/3 exploding shield is a requirement on DM.  You will be using this the rest of the game, even at later levels.  This skill will save you so many times.  These first 3 skills will give you a solid base in which we will now build a potion guzzling, decoction taking witcher-god that will slaughter any monster that he comes across.  I also like starting with these 3 skills in a role-playing sense; this gives Geralt a great base of basic skills that are needed before potions, decoctions, and mutations elevate him to true greatness.  It also hints at your combat play style:  dodging and fast attacks while using Quen as soon as it is depleted.  You should have these 3 skills all before or right after you leave White Orchard.  Make sure you get all places of power and have the Viper swords before leaving the prologue as well.  Lastly, a note on armor:  every time you come across a better set of light armor, equip it.  Every few levels also see if you can craft something better.  It is not until level 17 when you can use the cat school witcher gear (armor and swords), which you will use the rest of the game, enhancing along the way when you can.  I typically do switch to the Manticore Armor, but this is at level 40.    


A note on play style:  you should be using quen at all times and dodging with your quick attacks.  Apply oil for every fight (I‚Äôve seen it stated that you can‚Äôt add oil mid-fight.  This is not true for me, add before or during fights as needed).  From the very beginning:  Use potions!  30% increase in attack!  Faster stamina and health regen!  These are great buffs and should be utilized.  Even at the start of the game, you can easily take 3 potions at a time.  Toxicity drops pretty fast so you will be able to pretty steadily drink potions.  Bombs are also a huge boast during fights and I rely on the quick auto-aim throw by tapping the RB button (xbox) during fights.  Freezing opponents or watching them explode is a lot of fun ‚Äì start using bombs if you haven‚Äôt already!  Think of them as grenades and start firing away!    


Starting at level 6 (4th skill slot), you will use nothing but alchemy until the late stages of the game.  The 4th and 5th slots can be interchanged, but they should be the 2 skills that let you use a lot more potions and allow you to start mixing decoctions and potions at the same time:  Heightened Tolerance 5/5 and Acquired Tolerance 3/3.   These 2 skills allow for all the potion drinking you may ever need, and more importantly, the use of decoctions plus potions.  Very quickly you will have a toxicity that allows for decoctions plus the potions you need in battle.  I say around 130 toxicity (with 5/5 Heightened Tolerance) you can easily manage this and should have created enough useful decoctions that you should always have one enabled for fights.  My favorites are the Succubus decoction (attack power steadily increases each fight until caps at 30% at 60 seconds) and the Water Hag decoction (at max vitality, attack power is increased 50%!  This decoction is very powerful after equipping the next skill).  When you get to about 200 toxicity, you should have 2 decoctions going at once.  As you can see, with simply the 2 decoctions mentioned above and a couple potions, you are starting to be a very powerful witcher indeed.  Start experimenting with decoctions and find the ones that work for you/are the most fun.    


#**Mid-Game Leveling**    


Next skill (slot 6) will be Refreshment 5/5.   This makes every potion drank heal 25% of vitality.  This is one of the most powerful skills on DM, where meditating does not heal, and creates a very powerful combination with the Water Hag decoction.  It also makes healing after a fight inconsequential as you can just drink a potion at the start of the next.   You will also not have to waste toxicity on healing potions so much, as every potion now heals.  Slot 7 will be Protective Coating 5/5.  This will give Geralt a flat 25% protection against the monster type of the oil he has equipped on his blade.  By now, you should have all the Enhanced Oils, which have a longer life span then the regular oils, and should be using oils all the time anyway, so this skill is very useful indeed on DM.    


At this point you should start feeling like a god-like witcher.  You should have all Enhanced potions, oils, and bombs, and starting to have Superior items.  You should be using 2 decoctions for every fight and using potions to heal and boast buffs.  During fights I don‚Äôt take any potion until vitality is lost, starting with attack power, stamina regen, and then sign power, taking 1 potion at a time to bring vitality back to 100%.   If Water Hag decoction is equipped, throw in a swallow against tougher enemies to stay at 100% vitality throughout the battle if this is an issue.    


The next skill to select is Tissue Transformation (Vitality + 1,000 when decoction is consumed).  I selected this skill before knowing that this bonus is given for each decoction consumed.  So, with 2 decoctions going at once, you will have +2,000 to vitality, a huge boast on DM.  With a couple greater green mutations as well, Geralt is now a tank.  Late game, with 3 decoctions, this skill gives you an extra 3,000 vitality points ‚Äì truly worth investing in.  This skill also reinforces the idea to always have decoctions going during gameplay, and increases the vitality given for each potion drank as it is based on percentage.  Decoctions should now be lasting close to an hour (of actual game-play, not cutscenes).  Since you are meditating at about this rate, it is safe to always have decoctions going, and always taking advantage of this skill/bonus.    


The next skill I selected is Poisoned Blades 5/5.  This was a little bit of a process of elimination game.  A skill with 5/5 is required to unlock the bottom row.  Fast Metabolism may sound good, but this will have a huge negative consequence on the mutation Euphoria, so should be avoided at all costs.  If you use a lot of bombs, taking one of those 5/5 skills is possible here, but the Poisoned Blades is effective against tough enemies or large groups of small ones.  The 15% chance to poison an enemy is tripled to 45% with Superior Oils, and pretty much guarantees an enemy with a lot of life will be poisoned early on in a fight.  The steady drip of damage to Geralt‚Äôs enemies with this skill equipped will come in very handy for the rest of the game, and I highly recommend using it now.    


#**End-Game**    


You now have the bottom tier skills available, and the next skill is one of my favorites:  Side Effects 5/5.  This gives you a 100% chance of activating the effects of a 2nd potion when drinking 1.  The description is a little misleading as you will only be able to activate 1 ‚Äòbonus‚Äô potion at a time.  The ‚Äòbonus‚Äô potion also ignores the time extension you have due to all the points in alchemy.  This is quite alright, as every 20 or 30 seconds, depending on which bonus potion is given, you can activate a new one.  By now, your superior potions and decoctions now last about 170% longer, so shouldn‚Äôt expire during a fight.  Activating a new potion steadily throughout a fight when you take damage (to keep vitality at 100%), you should be regularly taking advantage of this skill.  I keep attack power, sign regen, sign power, and swallow equipped in the hot keys and take them in that order only as I lose vitality.  These potions make up 95% of the potions I take.  By the time you take the 3rd potion, there is a good chance the ‚Äòbonus‚Äô potion has run its course and you are ready to get another bonus one.  It‚Äôs a fun skill and the randomness is fun to see play out ‚Äì you end up using and taking advantage of a lot of potions you don‚Äôt usually use ‚Äì vitality max increase, adrenaline point regen, etc.  Getting Cat once in a while is totally worth the benefits to this skill.    


From here, you can acquire any skill you desire that complements your play style.  Again, do not take Fast Metabolism.  I also recommend against Adaption ‚Äì by now decoctions are lasting well over an hour and adding more time to them is completely unnecessary.  Fixative can also be avoided as I find 60 strikes to be plenty once you have all the Superior Oils.  Delayed Rcovery is also redundant with how long potions now last, as is Endure Pain  with Heightened Tolerance at 5/5.  To stay in alchemy, combining the skills Killing Spree and Hunter Instinct can have devastating effects on your enemies.  Cluster Bombs are a lot of fun.  You could also go back and use some combat skills to increase critical chance or adrenaline points, or invest in some more signs (I love Axii).  If you end up having 3 combat or 3 sign skills, along with 9 alchemy, I recommend getting Synergy as this will give your mutagens 50% more power ‚Äì with 4 greater mutagens, this skill will end up giving you 20% more attack or sign power, as well as 900 more vitality points.  I chose Synergy as my 11th skill slot and rode those bonuses all the way to my end game;  As soon as you are able (low 30s level), start the first quest or 2 of Blood and Wine to unlock the extra skill slots and Mutations (get and use Euphoria as soon as you are able).  I ended up with 3 combat skills (60% attack power with Synergy; Muscle Memory, Resolve, and a toss-up between Fleet Footed and Precise Blows) 2 Signs (45% sign increase; Quen and Axii) + 1 general skill (cat school or griffin school if you start using the Manticore armor at level 40), and 10 alchemy skills (+1,800 vitality with Synergy).  Truly unstoppable.    


This build will eventually allow you to destroy Death March.  You will be able to take on any opponent with your wealth of options available to you via decoctions and potions and feel like a true Witcher.  Preparing for tough battles is a necessity in order to get the right Oils, Bombs and techniques, as well as to give you clues on what decoction will work best.  With all the alchemy skills and Euphoria (toxicity level increases attach power and sign intensity) as a mutation you can sit back and watch Geralt destroy anything in his path.  Geralt maxes out at 280 toxicity with Acquired Knowledge, just enough to start using 3 decoctions.  Getting the Manticore Armor at level 40 moves you to 310, plenty of room for 3 decoctions without using a skill slot on Metabolic Control.  If you switch to the Manticore Armor, switch out Cat with Griffin school skill.  It is worth the 1 ability point.  If you want to go for 4 decoctions, use Manticore Armor as well as Metabolic Control, but I find 3 decoctions to be plenty and would rather save that skill slot for something else.    


#**In Conclusion**    


I ask again - What was the point of the Trail of the Grasses if you‚Äôre not going to guzzle some potions and mutations, relish in that greenish fog of drugs, rage and power, and destroy anything in Geralt‚Äôs way?  Enjoy this build and amazing game!",14,1582218402,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/f6w3kc/witcher_3_death_march_an_alchemy_build_guide/,witcher,2
f6vpuu,kadudl,Witcher 3 - Infamous Music Disappearance Bug Fix,"Recently I decided to play the Witcher 3 again and during the Lambert-Quest in Kaer Morhen I got the infamous music glitch which makes the background music completely disappear, alongside many of other sound effects, only a few would still work. On the Internet I found two camps which were basically fighting about what this bug means for you: The first camp saying that you can fix this bug easily by using the so called ‚ÄúSkellige Gwent Trick‚Äù (travel to Skellige, play a random dude and return to Novigrad/Velen) and the second saying that this trick doesn‚Äôt work and that the bus is unfixable. 

Now, I had no other save and playing without all the music and most sound effects was no option for me, so I tried a few things and here is my conclusion: **Yes, the Skellige trick does work, but it‚Äôs not always as easy as people say it is.** Let me explain: 

As I said, during the Lambert Quest I got the bug. After finishing it, I tried various things, reloading, restarting, etc. but nothing worked. Then I tried the Skellige trick. First time, I travelled to Kaer Trolde, played against the Blacksmith there. I noticed that even in Gwent some of the sound effects would be missing but they would strangely reappear again sometimes. After playing I didn‚Äôt notice any change. I traveled to Novigrad, the bug was still there. Second time I did the same thing, this time some of the sound effects reappeared (like casting Igni and footsteps) but when I returned to Novigrad they were all gone again. The Third time I did the exact same things again, and like the first time nothing changed. So I tried to change the approach. I traveled to a random Skellige village this time, played against a merchant there. Again, some sound effects returned. Then, I played the Blacksmith in Kaer Trolde again. Then I walked into the fortress towards where Crach is, and the local fortress music started playing. I decided to fast travel not to Novigrad this time, but to Crows Perch, and this time the music returned! Velen‚Äôs theme started playing and when I entered the Perch, its own theme started playing too! No idea why, but it worked! Well mostly. But thats not the end.

I then decided to head to Kaer Morhen again to do the quest with Eskel. To my suprise, when I arrived there, music started playing again, but it was not the Kaer Morhen music, but the Velen music instead. No idea why. Better than nothing though, so I just went to find Eske and do the quest. Throughout half the quest only Velen music played and even during the battles it was the Velen battle theme which would play, not the Kaer Morhen one. That is, until the first cutscene with Eskel. During it, the Kaer Morhen theme started playing, which I think to be scripted somehow to start in the scene. Afterwards, the usual Kaer Morhen music played through my time being there. After finishing the quest I went to Novigrad near a gate, and I was exited to hear the right music playing there too. The bug was fixed and everything was normal again wherever I went.

So, if anyone is struggling with this music bug in the future: **It IS fixable, but its not always simple.** You might have to make multiple attempts with using different locations but it will probably work in the end. I suspect that some people got lucky and got the bug fixed immediately after playing Gwent in Skellige, while others did not and gave up before the trick would fix the problem. 

I hope this helps anybody because if left unresolved this would have destroyed my will to play and rendered hours of game time useless. I didn't find many helpful answers online so I decided to post this more detailed guide here.
