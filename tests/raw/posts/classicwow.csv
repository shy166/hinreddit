fsobrm,JRobinson16e,Looking for participants for a WoW survey study!,"**You may have seen this post before!  If you've already taken this survey, please do not take it again.  Thank you!**

Hello! My name is Jessica Robinson, and I am an assistant professor and researcher at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on social and emotional experiences in video games – who we play with, who we talk to, and how we play while socializing. I’ve been playing *World of Warcraft* myself since just after *The Burning Crusade* launched.

I’m looking for current players of *World of Warcraft* to participate in a study about players’ experiences in Azeroth. This research study focuses on the emotional connections that *World of Warcraft* players develop within the world of Azeroth – connections to their personal experiences, to their fellow players, and to Azeroth itself. If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to fill out a survey that asks about your experiences in *World of Warcraft*, the specific *World of Warcraft* content you play, and basic demographic information. This research will help video game scholars better understand the emotional connections that players form with video game worlds; this knowledge can improve game design and user experience in the future!

I am looking for current players of *World of Warcraft Battle for Azeroth* AND current players of *World of Warcraft Classic* to participate in this study. You might be a player of just *Battle for Azeroth*, just *Classic*, or both!

Participation is voluntary, and all of your responses and information will be kept confidential. You must be a current player of *World of Warcraft* (*Battle for Azeroth* AND/OR *Classic*) and 18 years of age or older to participate. If you’re interested in participating, have any questions, or want more information, please feel free to get in touch with me via email ([jrobinson@kutztown.edu](mailto:jrobinson@kutztown.edu))

The question asking participants to list locations in Azeroth has been updated based on feedback from participants - thank you for the feedback!

If you are interested in participating, please use this link to open the (updated) survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWS4niarF2PtRCe6jMQ-FTYaD\_-7Pjs5iYD9KSxg5CzayMxw/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWS4niarF2PtRCe6jMQ-FTYaD_-7Pjs5iYD9KSxg5CzayMxw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

fsms0z,ma0za,Is this real life?,"so guys i kind of don't know what to say but felt like i have to tell someone how lucky i just got and you are my victims. bare with me for a minute and sorry for this wall of text.

so for months and months i was trying to farm Tidal Charm off Prince Nazjak that horrible rare mob in Arathi Highlands with a 32-48 hour respawn timer and a 40% dropchance.

for months... and i never even saw him. Well eventually i stopped because it felt like a waste of my time. So today i finished my pvp grind to rank 11 to get the mounts and i decided now is the time to finally get this damn trinket.

so i go all out. i stock up on swim speed potions and get myself a deepdive helmet, i scout out a good hidden location to camp him under water for days. I install the unitscan addon for an alert sound for when he spawns and am ready to park my main there for 2 weeks straight...

so i get to the location, park my char there and 3 minutes later the alert goes off. I was 100% sure its some kind of error but when i double checked with my target macro that f\*\*\*er spawned right next to me. so with my hands lightly shaking i send him to hell where he belongs and he drops the god damn trinket. 

what the actual f\*\*\*\*....

im super happy but still not sure what just happened.

Or shall I stay feral until higher level? Will I get groups for the dungeons I’d need at 55 as restoration?! Also will it slow my levelling time down by not questing and trying to get groups for dungeons?

I can’t decide!

fsj0lx,Aureliusmind,Warlock or Priest?,"I can't decide which alt to level to 60; both are around level 18. My main is a geared, fury dps warrior.

* I mainly raid, not much pvp at all. I dont have the time for the vanilla pvp grind

* My warrior will remain my progression character (doing the newest raids) where as my alt will be coming to MC/Ony/older content.

* I need a second lvl 60 that can farm for me (namely herbs for consumables)

* I want to be able to hold my own in wpvp when farming - my warrior gets killed all the time when farming.

* I love the prebis dungeon farming phase of a character's life. The idea of farming both a healing set and dps set for priest appeals to me.

* Priest healer has an easier time putting groups together for dungeons.

* I'm not sure if I want to spend hours spamming a few healing spells in raids.

* I'm motivated by parsing well and pushing raid clear times; a priest migbt be better suited for filling this need as I may enjoy the competition of parsing well as a healer vs parsing well as a warlock.

* I'm not sure if I want to spend hours spamming a few DPS spells as a warlock and not even be on top of the meters like I am with my warrior; having most of my spells resisted.

* Shadowpriest in raids doesn't appeal to me since they go OOM really fast and only one is needed in raids.

* I'm not sure which class is more fun to level; so far, fear juggling and drain tanking is more enjoyable than wand spam with my priest.

* TBC considerations: I will be more interested in pvp come TBC with the implementations of arenas.

&amp;#x200B;

Horde.

Orc -  You went to the character selection and thought which race should i be as a person who never had an independent thought in their life and specifically believes everything their mum tells them because she's always been right before.

Tauren - You are the helpful person always willing to bend over take whatever everyone else does. UNTIL you aren't and then you dig your heels in and let everyone know why you took all that shit and throw your toys out of the pram with a snap of your finger over seemingly the most simple of requests.

Troll - You thought for ages on which Race to be but you just couldn't bring yourself to pick troll until it hit you that you don't have to listen to some twat on the internet on how you should play your game. Happily moving along in life. Has a nice full weekend but doesn't go on about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Undead - No small reward is worth passing up if it involves watching paint dry for 8 hours a day and ruining any professional/social relationships is all the better. Being so so good with girls according to yourself doesn't mean much when you are as allergic to UV as the undead you play.

&amp;#x200B;

Alliance.

Human - Getting a dessert at a restaurant is a special treat even though it wouldn't effect you financially in any meaningful way. Also if your partner suggested anything other than missionary you would think that they were being rude. 

Nightelf - Once you gave a pound to a beggar cos they promised they didn't do heroine only spice and who doesn't want herbs with their steak. You always feel like you need to justify your worth to humans because you are only a little different to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Dwarf - Fiercely loyal you probably listen to this song while playing and if you don't you didn't know about it  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CZjsEI1yU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CZjsEI1yU) 

You are a scholar and a gent.

fshc8k,hardcoregamingdave,2 Mob Farming Spots Over 50g+ an hour,"In case you missed my last 2 videos I went over 2 great locations where you can farm mobs and make 50g+.  One spot is in blasted lands for part 1 and Winterfall for part 2.    Both areas any class can farm them.

These guides are more for beginners are veterans will already know these spots. 

&amp;#x200B;

3 Tips to make the most out of any open world mob farming spot:

\#1.  Farm between 3-10am. This is when least amount of people on and on a medium pop server I get several hours of maximum gold per hour.

\#2.  Time the spawn times after you kill them so you can rotate between camps and tag mobs fast. This will cause any other players to leave out of frustration.

\#3.  Sell the mats from these farms on raid days only as that is when prices are at it's peak. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any constructive criticism or tips of other area's that are also a good mob farming spot then please let me know below.

fsg2ad,TravVdb,Questions about optimal dagger rogue talents,"I've been using the Bloodmoon spreadsheet to sim my DPS and I've run into some inconsistencies with some of the more popular talent builds for rogue daggers. It could be due to the gear I'm using but I have fairly standardized gear based on BiS lists. Anyway, here are the two things that are throwing me off...

The first one is that for Combat Daggers, it appears that I get much better DPS by putting 2 points into Murder and 1 into Ruthlessness instead of the traditional 3 into Ruthlessness. Maybe this is because of the talent being relevant now in Blackwing Lair but I don't see any builds recommending this.

The second one is that for Seal Fate Daggers, it appears that I get much better DPS by removing all points from Opportunity and putting them into Dual-Wield Specialization and Blade Flurry. This again seems counter to what all the builds say.

Is this just not a good program for simulations or is the previous knowledge on optimal builds incorrect? I want to go forward playing as best as possible but it's tough when the simulation shows things that are opposite to what I've been hearing this whole time.",1,1585672242,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fsg2ad/questions_about_optimal_dagger_rogue_talents/,classicwow,1
fsg1ho,GideonAI,"A Treatise on ""Undead Melee Shadow Priest Tanking"" and why it won't be around in TBC","Hey guys, just finished writing the script for my next video and WOW that's a lot of words! It'll take me a while to record and edit so I figured I'd get the info out there early.

TL;DR:

Armor - Roughly equal to plate but without a shield.

Threat Output - 1k threat opener with 200 threat-per-second followup, scales with gear only slightly.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Undead Melee Shadow Priest Tanking (for simplicity we can shorten it to Undead Priest Tanking) is a really fun way to tank. The ""Melee"" part of the title comes from using a very fast weapon to attack in between instant-cast spells, which we'll be spamming throughout most fights.

The core concept of Undead Priest Tanking is that you open up with Mind Blast on the kill target, hit Shadow Word: Pain on the side targets, and then spam Touch of Weakness (an Undead Priest-Racial spell) until the end of the fight. This works very well in dungeons as a ""DPS Tank"" because you do good AoE damage but are a bit squishier than plate-and-shield classes. In Raids, Mind Flay is a better threat generator than Touch of Weakness so I'll be focusing on dungeon tanking.

I also don't recommend executing this build at earlier levels than 60 (although it can be done), so I'll be focusing the math side of things from a level 60 perspective.

As always, there are 2 necessary aspects of tanking: Damage Mitigation and Threat. We'll cover Mitigation first because many believe that Priests are one of the squishiest classes in the game when in fact, they are superb in this area when specced for it.

----------------**MITIGATION**----------------

First up we'll tackle Physcial damage mitigation tools, starting with Shadowform. I tested with a glorious Hunter on Skeram server named Fennicon who shot me while wearing different levels of armor with Shadowform equipped and we confirmed that Shadowform applies its damage reduction independently of armor. This simplifies our math: physical damage taken is reduced by 15% and then is passed into armor reduction calculations. 

Next up is Inner Fire. Baseline it provides 1,400 armor straight up. When talented, it provides 2,000. This alone puts us very favorably compared to other classes. When it runs out mid-combat (because 20 charges isn't much), re-casting it will still inflict 60 AoE threat divided amongst the enemies in combat, so using up that GCD isn't the end of the world. It's mostly irritating for it's mana cost.

Finally on the armor side of things is actual cloth gear you're wearing. Normally a level 60 cloth-wearer will have around 500 armor from items. However, there are many ways to get additional points from odd means. Most obvious one is through non-cloth gear, like weapons, trinkets, and jewelry that have the +Armor stat. However, for cloth specifically you can also wear the 3 cloth dungeon sets which each have +200 armor as their 2-piece set bonus and together grant a total of +600 armor. In the Arathi Basin reputation rewards one can find the Defiler's Boots, Belt, and Shoulders which all have roughly double, sometimes triple the amount of armor of a normal cloth piece, and in Phase 5 we'll be seeing the cloth Ironweave set which also has similar extreme levels of armor. 2 additional pieces of cloth armor which have absurd armor levels are the Immortal Gloves and the Necroknight's Garb, both of which have such high armor that they were often given to Feral Druid tanks back in Vanilla.

Getting 4,000 and even upwards of 5,000 armor is not too hard for a Priest, especially with buffs and consumes.

Also worth mentioning is Power Word: Shield, which is the only ""direct heal""-type ability available in Shadowform. I typically only use this on myself in times when I know my healer is unable to heal me or when he's dropping down in mana and I have extra to spare, but it can help when cast on others in the group who are taking damage as well. It's also decent for casting regular spells that normally would get slowed due to pushback from taking damage, but most of the time it pops really quickly so it's not always a guarantee. Power Word: Shield applies normal healing threat to all those in combat with you. 

Renew is something you can cast on yourself before combat and before entering Shadowform, but that route is so mana-costly that I don't bother myself.

Speaking of normal heals, you can also drop out of Shadowform and heal yourself (or others) if necessary. However, unless I've been crit recently and procced Martyrdom, I won't use this technique because the spell pushback from taking damage will slow down your healing to a crawl.

Vampiric Embrace is not usually a worthwhile spell to cast because it occupies a useful GCD for keeping up threat. Unlike normal Shadow Priests who try to deal single-target damage, we don't even do that much single-target damage (just single-target threat), so Vampiric Embrace heals for so little that it's only in extreme situations that I'll use this (such as when everyone in the party needs heals and I don't have threat and I need to target a single enemy and burn him down with Mind Flays).

Devouring Plague is a nice self-heal-over-time but is extremely mana-expensive so I don't recommend using this unless you want a fight ended quickly and you know you won't run out of mana. Devouring Plague doesn't generate healing threat, just damage threat.

Indirectly related to mitigation is the Priest talent ""Unbreakable Will"", which grants 15% resistance to all Stuns, Fears, and Silences (all of which can ruin your day as a tank). Because 15% still ain't much, I'd recommend planning your dungeon runs in advance so that you don't end up wiping everyone because you got Silenced for 10 seconds straight and nobody could dispell.

Priests also get access to the talent ""Spell Warding"" which reduces all spell damage taken by 10% (which includes attacks that aren't technically spells but deal elemental damage), as well as the talent ""Blessed Recovery"" which heals back 25% of physical critical damage taken over 6 seconds. Unfortunately when you receive 2 crits then it overwrites the first heal-over-time. I'm not actually sure if the self-heal causes threat or not, but it's still a good talent.

Also, you can opt to take the Blackout talent which gives a 10% chance to stun enemies for 3 seconds when you hit them with a Shadow spell. It's good but it can cause unintended situations when you want to manipulate the position of an enemy mob. Most bosses are also immune to stun.

Psychic Scream is yet another indirect form of damage mitigation yet one that is extremely dangerous and should only be used if you know it can't backfire or risking it is necessary to avoid a wipe. It deals 120 threat to all enemies hit by it so it's not bad in that regard, but it can throw off your party members in terms of actually killing things.


To summarize, a Priest fully tricked out for maximum damage mitigation is roughly equal to a Warrior with no shield. Priests also have 900 less health due to lower innate Stamina, and Warriors can Parry, but the difference is still closer than people realize.


----------------**THREAT**----------------

Moving on now to Threat Output. For those unaware, 1 damage = 1 threat. 

Mind Blast deals double it's damage in threat instead. However, spell pushback hurts this ability greatly so you'll mostly only be using Mind Blast when you're opening combat, fighting against a single enemy in between their swing timer, or are affected by Focused Casting because you're using the Martyrdom talent and you've just been crit. There are also a pair of gloves you can get starting at PvP rank 7 that give you a 50% chance to avoid casting pushback on Mind Blast, so they're a really good option for tanking. However, because this is an Undead-only, and therefore a Horde-only build, you can't take advantage of the Paladin's Improved Concentration Aura to get the other 50% pushback reduction. You can use Mind Blast while bubbled, but bubbles tend to pop rather quickly when you're tanking. Mind Blast scales at 43% of your +Spell Damage.

Touch of Weakness, the core spell of this build, deals a variable amount of threat.

Firstly, it deals normal damage threat to the enemy who strikes you first after casting the spell. This damage scales at 10% of your Shadow Damage. Secondly, it deals level-based debuff threat. Debuff threat is calculated by taking the level you learned a spell and doubling that number, so Touch of Weakness rank 1 is learned at level 10 so that debuff deals 20 threat, while rank 6 is learned at level 60 and deals 120 threat from it's debuff. Thirdly, Touch of Weakness counts as a buff to yourself and so it deals level-based buff threat. Buffs generate threat equal to the level you learned the spell, so rank 6 Touch of Weakness deals 60 threat. However, this is divided amongst all enemies in combat with you, so its usefulness varies depending on the size of the fight and what you're trying to build aggro on.

Timing is key with this spell, and to make sure I'm hitting the right target I use the addon [WeaponSwingTimer](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weaponswingtimer), which lets me see when my targeted enemy is about to attack me. If you spam Touch of Weakness, you might end up generating aggro on a secondary target rather than the kill target. Most enemies don't have such slow attacks that it lowers your threat output too much, but enemies with like 3-second-long attacks may demand using Wands or Mind Flay in between Touches of Weakness.

Shadow Word: Pain is one of the best damage-over-time spells in the game. Because of this, it's also really good for dealing threat. Ideally you use this on the kill target after opening with Mind Blast, and then cast it on the rest of the enemies in the area. It's pretty mana-intensive but you can look at it as a 1,000+ damage instant-cast ability in terms of the value it provides over the course of a fight.

Mind Flay deals very good threat because it also deals debuff threat, but you won't be able to cast it very often due to spell pushback. I only recommend it when you're not being hit constantly or have procced Martyrdom.

Your melee damage will provide a small amount of damage threat, but against lower-level enemies it will be much greater. Keep an eye out for a future video on the caster-class melee damage calculations.

Gift of Arthas is an insane threat generator, I calculated somewhere around 300 threat for a single debuff which is pretty crazy, so if you have the money and can't keep threat then definitely invest in some of these.

So as you can see, threat generation is kind of capped due to the generally bad scaling of the Shadow Priest abilities. Assuming no +Spell Damage gear, you're getting an initial burst of 1,200 threat from Mind Blast followed by 50 threat-per-second from Shadow Word: Pain and, if you hit all of your Touches of Weakness on the same target, an average of 145 threat-per-second in addition. 200 threat-per-second isn't great, especially if your buddies are dealing significantly more than 200 damage-per-second or who like to avoid killing skull first. With a decent amount of +Spell Damage or +Shadow Damage gear (let's say +200), then you get an initial burst of 1,370 threat from Mind Blast, an average of 60 threat-per-second from Shadow Word: Pain, and an average of 165 threat-per-second from Touches of Weakness, for 225 threat-per-second.

So in combination, what you get with an Undead Priest Tank is a tank that deals more AoE damage than many thanks to Shadow Word: Pain, but is a bit squishier than most warriors and fails to scale very highly in terms of threat output. All of the shortcomings of the Undead Priest Tank (or any tank for that matter) can be solved with powerful consumables, but I don't personally form my opinions of specs on that basis.

Also, even though Blood Elves gain access to Touch of Weakness in Burning Crusade, dps numbers get multiplied by about 5x in that expansion while level-based buff/debuff threat only increases from 60-70 which is an increase of 1.1x, so unless the scaling of the spell's damage also increases to like 43% or something unlisted in the patch notes then this spec won't be viable for tanking past 60.

If they have the benefits of undeath, why not have the downsides too? They are creatures that should not exist in the natural world, risen from their slumber by the engineered plague. I propose that Blizzard stay true to the RPG lore and classify Forsaken players as true ""undead"" rather than humanoid. Make them immune to poisons and diseases, keep will of the forsaken, but make them vulnerable to paladin's scare undead, exorcism, lower their resistance to holy magic, and make them susceptible to shackling. It would be great flavor, and it's half the fun of picking the monstrous races at character creation.",39,1585663420,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fsdg8d/forsaken_players_should_be_susceptible_to_shackle/,classicwow,1

I don't really care much for PvE; I mean, I will raid for as much as is necessary to get properly geared, but my main interest is PvP. Having said that, I wonder if there's any class in particular which has more or less had at least one good PvP spec consistently throughout the entirety of WoW, from Vanilla to BFA. I'm not looking for a FOTM class, just one that is always viable for PvP without feeling nerfed to the ground. The caveat is that it has to be DPS in particular, as I'm not interested in supporting or healing. So, seeing how we'll most likely have TBC repeat itself all over again (and the future thereafter remaining unknown), which class do you think is a good bet knowing the history of all previous expansions and Blizzard's general behavior when it comes to class balancing?",37,1585662194,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fsd4pc/which_class_is_consistently_good_for_dps_in_pvp/,classicwow,1

1. Use rank 1 serpent sting

2. Pick a mob that can't possibly kill your pet, pull it with your pet with a growl, then put the pet to passive.

3. Start autorunning and get stuck somewhere facing the mob. Could be a rock, could be some pillar, whatever (I used a small hill). That way you won't have to manually adjust your course.

4. Spam serpent sting until you run out of mana.

fsbaqy,RuRu92,Am I the only one that is not excited for classic TBC? Maybe it’s just me..,"Here’s my situation: I only started playing WoW originally when TBC was almost coming out. I remember that when the expansion released and people started going trough the portal I was nearing the end of my 1-60 journey. 

So therefore I never really was able to enjoy being just 60. Never got to raid, never got attuned, never tried to get BIS gear etc. I just dinged to 60 and got straight trough the portal and continued the journey. After getting to 70 I quickly lost interest and stopped playing. 

I was so excited to play classic because I could finally experience what I missed out in my original playtrough. And because I played horde originally because my friends played horde, I could finally also play alliance. Therefore it actually felt and still feels like almost a completely new game to me! 

However I only started playing classic at the end of februari because I wasn’t sure I had the time to play it and currently I am again.. taking my time enjoying the game and working towards 60 (currently level 35 and having so much fun!). I’m also part of an amazing guild and really enjoying my social contacts!

However now with TBC getting sort of announced a lot of people have played so much classic (originally and now again) that they are totally up for TBC. I am, however, already seeing that I will get in the exact same situation as before. When I’m finally ready to raid, TBC will probably be ready to launch and people will move on. Meaning I will be left behind on empty servers... or be forced to move on to TBC and again miss out on the experience I wanted to get. Therefore I am not excited for TBC coming out and will probably decide on not playing it because my reason of playing was totally different as to most people here! 

Is there anyone feeling the same way? What would you advice me to do? Or should I just continue my journey to 60 and if I can’t raid then that’s just too bad? :P",40,1585654189,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fsbaqy/am_i_the_only_one_that_is_not_excited_for_classic/,classicwow,1

fsarbt,samhf18,Why do I have delay during the day?,"So I've had some time off work and I've got to play during the early hours of the morning. I've noticed something very frustrating.

After around midnight the game will feel flawless, for example I'll charge in on my warrior in a battleground and get an instant auto attack off and can hamstring imedetiately. Everything registers without a delay.

However during the day such as now if I charge it takes 1-3 seconds for me to get 1 auto swing off and to even get the rage to hamstring instantly. What is this delay?


I've checked and compared my internet results from early this morning and now and nothing has changed to cause this lag input.

Is this normal because it's impossible my internet is doing this to me. Also it's been happening way before the virus so the increase in people cannot be the reason.


It's annoying. I can grind flawless early in the morning due to no delay but during the day every attack seems delayed by like 1-3 seconds.

I only played a Paladin on a private server before, and it was mostly a clicking experience beyond the 1-5 buttons, but now things are going to change. 

First, here are the normally available keys that I am using for my chars: Q, E, R, F, C, X, Z, T, G, V, 1-5 keys, mouse buttons 4 and 5, middle mouse button. ""5"" is not very convenient to press in combat, but I can bind some not-so-needed ability to it. Obviously, I bound A and D to strafe. 

All in all, I have 18 keys, which I can double to 36 and even triple to 54 by combining with Shift and Ctrl. 

Shift+1-5 will most likely be applying symbols to mobs (those like skulls and moons), so that's actually 31 or 49. 

F1-F5 keys are still targeting party members. I don't want to rebind them (at least yet).

fs6e1y,StarStarFruit,New player looking for help/friends/guild to make him half decent.,"Hey Guys, 

Due to Covid-19 and that meaning I therefore will not be going anywhere for the next 3 months or so, I figured I'd get into Classic WoW.

Problem is, whilst I played WoW a little back in the day, I'm certainly struggling to get to grips with it now, even after putting a couple hours or so in, and with no current friends playing it either, I've nobody to show me the ropes or keep me company. 

Got myself a nice new fancy SOA laptop, mouse and headset for it, but another problem is, I'm not really a PC gamer, so I haven't the foggiest when it comes to hotkeys, macros, add-ons or anything like that either, So I really am going in blind and could use a buddy, or all the help I can get, forums and discords are great and all, but people or a guild are probably going to have the most effect. 

I guess you could consider me an investment, I'm a pretty serious gamer on consoles, so I'd love to go from zero to hero and end up raiding with the big boys on PC once you've sculpted me into something worth taking.

If it's relevant information, I'm UK based, and will be rolling both a holy priest and shadow priest (For PvP) on whatever server I end up on after this post.",5,1585628977,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fs6e1y/new_player_looking_for_helpfriendsguild_to_make/,classicwow,1

fs4xw8,Rokhiani,Unpopular opinion: Blizzard should make leveling harder by removing the ability to boost low-level characters in dungeons,"Any solution to boosting would involve change and therefore be shouted down by hordes of players. But I don't even think Blizzard should take the easiest route, of changing XP formulas in groups so getting 'boosted' by a high-level mage is lower XP per hour than simply doing dungeons the old-fashioned way, with a group of appropriate-level characters.

I think Blizzard should force a 'timewalking'-style, level-scaling mechanic each time you enter a dungeon. Unlike modern WoW with [party sync](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Party_Sync), I think you should be able to keep all your abilities, because in Classic you generally don't get overpowered abilities and talents at higher levels. A mage gets Frostbolt at lvl 4, and it remains the 'highest-priority ability' for a frost mage in raids at the level cap.

Limit the maximum level to 2 levels below a dungeon's final boss, and suddenly everything is much more challenging. A lvl 60 warrior who went to tank Deadmines for their low-level friends would still have Whirlwind (obtained at lvl 36), an extra 40 talent points, and the equivalent of the best gear available to a lvl 20, but mobs are now a threat to them.

There are already enough people opposed to any changes at all, but to the people who say ""but then my mage alt couldn't farm elites in Zul'Farrak"", that's just too bad. If you and all the other mages doing this can't find a profitable alternative, maybe the economy will experience deflation and Black Lotus, etc. prices will go down.

It would also combat the AoE/'cleave' strategy/'meta'. Groups that do this are often several levels above the instance's mobs, letting them pull large groups with very little risk.

I would even support limiting the maximum level to 3 below the final boss. This could be a challenge for some groups, but isn't that why people play WoW Classic?",29,1585622840,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fs4xw8/unpopular_opinion_blizzard_should_make_leveling/,classicwow,1

The 4-Day Chats are a series of posts that will be stickied for approximately four days; this series started before launch and we are bringing it back! The purpose of this series is to open a larger forum for back-and-forth discussion about major topics pertaining to WoW Classic, with particular focus on currently hot-topics of discussion.


#Blackwing Lair

* Have you partially- or fully-cleared Blackwing Lair?
* How was BWL on launch night/day/week?
* Do you have any unique or interesting strategies for any of the bosses or trash?
* If you attempted BWL in Vanilla, how does BWL in Classic compare to your prior Vanilla experience?
* Have you gotten the gear you're wanting, or is something in particular remaining elusive?
* Which boss has given your guild the most trouble?
* Looking forward, is the April release of Zul'gurub good timing relative to BWL's release? When would you want AQ20/AQ40 to release?

Comments are default sorted as ""New"" but you may want to try ""Controversial"" to see more opinions on this topic.

\[u/Activision-Blizzard\](/user/Activision-Blizzard) 

\[u/BlizzCS\](/user/BlizzCS)

\[u/BlizzardUS\](/user/BlizzardUS)

I feel a pang of sadness when I see people refer to the entity that controls WoW as ""Blizzard"". Blizzard hasn't existed as we knew it since Activision bought them out in 2013. Since then there has been a constant downward spiral in quality of game and a steep rise in the aggressive consumerism that Activison brought. It was sometime shortly after that, when WoW turned into a cash cow for its corporate overlord.

The issue that brings me out of the shadows tonight is the overpopulation plague that currently afflicts the Classic server Incendius-US. Activision-Blizzard (don't you dare call them Blizzard) opened paid server transfers back in mid-December of 2019. This is a contrast to their free server transfers that they allowed off of the overpopulated servers at Classic's release. Because of its even H-A balance, Incendius became a prime target for characters that needed to transfer off of highly imbalanced servers. Now the server is so overpopulated, and combined with the COVID-19 quarantine influx, there is a daily hour (underestimated) queue that precludes many people from logging on to play at ""normal"" times. This is not the fault of the players or any circumstantial scenario. It is Activision's fault.

The fix for this seems quite simple, and has been voiced more than once by more than one player: allow free server transfers off of Incendius and halt any further transfers to the server. It is disgraceful to the name Blizzard that this atrocity has been allowed to continue in the wake of myriad requests and complaints from the people that have been affected.

Seeing the pattern with Activision, maybe there is a ""pay to hear my thoughts"" button I can click. Please present such a button so that I may feed you my tears.

I leveled my engineering in Goblin 1st and I got it all the way up to 300. I made all of the Goblin patterns I could make. Then, I removed the engineering skill so I could relearn engineering and take gnomish engineering. I have releveled engineering back up to 250 and went to that book in Tanaris and chose to go the route of gnomish engineering. I now have two questions.   


1. Where do I go to get the gnomish membership card? I don't have it in my inventory and I have been to Everlook, Tanaris, and Ratchet engineering vendors and cannot find a way to get that card. 
2. Since I did Goblin engineering already, I made the Everlook teleporter. My understanding is, you can use the Goblin items you made even if you are in gnomish engineering, but it seems like it will not work as it says ""requires Goblin engineering"" in red text. Is there a way I can use this teleporter while still in gnomish engineering?

frrvru,Oglethorppe,[TBC] There’s a much better way to handle the transition than Blizzard proposed.,"Step 1. Open fresh TBC servers, based on the TBC patch of their choice, but with all BC content locked, aside from Draenei and Blood Elf zones. Let people level, IF THEY WANT TO, in a server that’s not dominated by 60s with Naxx gear. Give them two or so months to level up. 

Then, after those two months, allow people to move their character over to these servers. There is now a server that was both fresh for the sake of leveling, and an option to send your character over, if you don’t want to start over. 

If there’s a flaw here, point it out. I think this is 100% the way they should go. I’m not going to play BE Pally or Draenei Shaman, but for the sake of those who are, this option let’s them level up without missing the glory of BC’s first months of progression raiding. 

I know Blizzard scours the forums, but even though they’re unlikely to see this post, I hope we can drum up this idea that many people have floated. It’s just a much better solution that is the best of both worlds.",53,1585578878,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/frrvru/tbc_theres_a_much_better_way_to_handle_the/,classicwow,1

frrgqb,Gaxtorious,Broken Tooth and other rare pets.,"Hello everyone interested in the rare pets for hunters WoW classic has to offer. I am thinking about  starting a discord and a spreadsheet for each of the rare pets which will be based on the info already provided across different websites. The thing is those websites contain essential info but nobody has bothered to track the spawn cycles of the rare mobs. I.E. we know spawns of Broken Tooth and it spawns once within 8 h every 8 h, but not at which time increments, how long it is up (whether it roams for the whole 8 h or is up for 30 min). This of course is serer dependent (when it spawned, when it was killed etc.), so the basic idea is to create a discord server and share spreadsheets and logs on when such beasts spawn, when they are spotted/tamed/killed. This will mean that for people interested, different logs and rooms for each server. It would take an insane effort and a lot of time.

frq9dv,ZordiakDev,Proposition for a 5th option,"If we progress into expansions we can end up in a situation where we kill the previous expansion (via population starving) each time a new one comes out.

Remember, it won't be long that this conversation will be about the transition between Wrath to Cataclysm.

I propose we start characters at level 1 for each new expansion.

But how do we ensure the longevity of each expansion? Simple. Seasons.

Let's say you're on Herod-US. Here will be the release schedule.

Herod-US

* Phase 1
* Phase 2
* Phase 3
* Phase 4
* Phase 5
* Phase 6
* 6 months to a year after Phase 6 release
* Herod-US-Season-1 Launches

Herod-US-Season-1 will repeat the above until Herod-US-Season-2 launches at which point a server merge of Herod-US-Season-1 will merge into Herod. 

Herod-US and it's Season servers will share name conflicts and character limits as well as faction limits. Ensuring a smooth merge transition. The ""Parent"" server being Herod-US and the Season server being Herod-US-Season-X will be for all intents and purposes completely isolated from each other. Other than sharing limits. No trades, mail, grouping, etc.

This will effectively create a new classic/TBC/Wrath/Cata/MoP/etc. experience every few years which everyone can look forward to.",12,1585572850,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/frq9dv/proposition_for_a_5th_option/,classicwow,1

frn1wa,Headsplitter,Is it possible to Ony buff your own alt?,"Hey all,

Hope you are doing fine in these Corona times. Stay healthy and in Azeroth :)

One question I have. I got my hands on Ony head on my resto druid. I just wanted the ring in case I need it one day. Or would you advise going for the Neck even though I never tank / Play feral?

The question I have:

When I place my druid at the turn in for the head to Trigger the buff. 

Then I log on to my alt warrior. 

Open a new WOW Client so my Warrior gets kicked. As fast as possible log into my Druid to turn in the head.

And then log into my warrior as quick as possible.

Do I get the buff on the warrior? Either by being fast enough to Login before the buff has triggered or by the warrior still being ""in the game"" even though he was kicked like 20sec ago?

Thanks in advance. Maybe somebody tried this already :D",15,1585557212,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/frn1wa/is_it_possible_to_ony_buff_your_own_alt/,classicwow,1

However he only used autoshots, where as in a raid youre fitting aimed and multis between autos A LOT. So I received 8-set today and wanted to test it myself properly, and here are my findings:

18 exp weakness in 550 shots =

0.03272727.... procs per shot

33.698 shots per minute (Ashjre'thul and full rotation) + \~3.3% procrate =

**1.1028436363636 procs per minute**

&amp;#x200B;

Which, is a lot higher than the previous (in my opinion) faulty test.

fre1kq,orderinthefort,How to handle TBC Progression,"I think Netherwing handled progression well by doing 2.0 itemization with 2.4.3 talents/bugfixes and pre-nerf raids.

This I think is a win-win because it makes a decent amount of your hard-earned naxx gear last a lot longer so it doesn't feel wasted (some 70 raid gear is actual trash with 2.0 itemization, dungeon blues and craftables are better than 2.0 t4 gear for a lot of classes)

It also makes the content harder which makes it more satisfying to complete and upgrade your existing gear.

The progression of 60 gear to t5 feels much better.

Including the 2.1 item/quest additions (such as the good meta gems) to launch would stagnate the progression flow of the content releases.

What do you think?

Also as a side note I think they should limit the amount of gold that gets transferred/copied to the TBC servers.

My argument is this:

I reallllly don't want to have to farm 50k gold in vanilla just to be as prepared as possible for TBC. I don't want to, but I will because I can and so can everybody else. And I think that in itself is the problem. There's no reason not to do it.

I'd much rather have gold *for* TBC be obtained *during* TBC rather than before TBC.

But if they go this route they need to announce it soon otherwise tons of people will complain about all the time they spent farming gold for it not to count toward TBC.",18,1585518528,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fre1kq/how_to_handle_tbc_progression/,classicwow,2

frdto1,CharmingSlice,"Our Server's PvP Brackets are set way too low, how can the system improve?","It is a PvE US East Coast server with a pool consistently below 1500 players and a lot of times dipping below 1000. The brackets are coordinated by a select few via a premade discord server. b10 is 200,000, and b13 is 500,000 with b14 undisclosed. Every week, multiple solo queue players will break the brackets and send the premade discord participants into a frenzy of in-game harassment and ""blackballing"" of the solo queue players who sometimes do not even know the discord exists (it was an invite-only discord up until a few weeks ago when they discovered they needed more healers and more bodies in general to raise pool size). The select few who set the brackets seem to have some ulterior motives to keeping the honor levels low for the top brackets. First, a majority of the players being allowed to push into b11-b14 are from the upper echelon raiding guilds on the server, who obviously don't have the time to do both PvE and PvP.  The second reason they seem to be adverse to raising the caps are because the premade teams just aren't good. From personal experience their teams have a winning percentage just a dick hair above solo queuing, often giving up within minutes against pugs if they can't five cap/get the first flag and sometimes immediately against other premades. These two reasons seem to be the driving force behind their low honor caps and the reason why multiple solo or casual queue players break their brackets on a weekly basis. 

What's the best way to convince these select few to adjust their system to allow every player to play the game how they want to without being harassed or blackballed? how does your server protect brackets, if at all? Does a 200k limit on b10 even make sense? I'd love to hear feedback from as many servers as possible how they handle it or what they set their bracket limits at because I may need to transfer if I can only pvp 2 days a week on my current server as a casual player.",19,1585517746,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/frdto1/our_servers_pvp_brackets_are_set_way_too_low_how/,classicwow,1

Looking at buying a new laptop, does anyone else run Classic from one &amp; if so, what's the cheapest I can get away with on low settings? How intensive is it?

I'm all for the vanilla experience, but not in terms of re experiencing the lag and load times!

fram3d,Same-Idea94,With TBC on its way. A few things need to change for it to be successful.,"TBC is my ALL time favorite Xpac, Even Above Wrath. I basically played Classic with the thought of TBC coming after. With the Knowledge we can take from classic and the Min-Max Culture we now have, We need to implement a few things in TBC or shit will fail hard. If you thought Classic was bad for being horde Dominated just wait... TBC will only be worse Private servers did incentives which helped and they can be implemented here. No Server will be a 50-50. But if you manage a 54-46 or a 60-40. It will still be playable.

\- Paladin Seals -  Seal of Vengence/Seal of Blood.  SOB is for Horde while SOV is for Ally..  SOB gives you a much higher DPS than SOV. So much so where Ret on horde is somewhat viable. Where Ally its a complete joke still. Both Factions should have SOB/SOV. No Question about it.

\-Cloning/Transfers/Instant58s- People want to Clone there Character, Some People want transfer, Heck some people just want Instant 58 or Progress into TBC and leave Classic behind.

I've played Classic.. Twice now. I don't think i'll come back to it again... So IDC what Blizzard Decides but the best option would be Cloned character. The way it should be done is Release the Server, But keep the Dark portal Closed. This would be around the time Nax Was released in classic. Give People One Month to get set up for BC. So have the New Talent Trees, To spec yourself. Be able to Form your Guild. Also to level Draenai and Blood elves. I Personally will be playing a paladin so i don't ding 70 while people are Full Cleared Kara. Wether its a x1 or x2 or x3 XP. Just give a Proper amount of time to ding 1-60 and go into the DP.

\-Wiping Gold/BOE's- I saw Asmongold mention this. Even though i think hes kind of a pleb he makes decent points. If we want the Economy to be Viable. People entering should just go with the gear on there back and no gold. We don't want people to ding 70 to have full epic flying mounts and just flooding the AH with Overpriced pots. Destroying the Market before it begun.

\-Upscale bosses- This is a little personal for me... With Classic, People are just fast clearing everything... its sort of a Meme if you don't clear MC in under 1hr you are average. Back in the day it took hours. Raids/Heroics were Def more difficult and needed Proper CC. (can't wait for some people thinking they can just Spellcleave things down in heroic and die) but in the End the bosses are still super simplistic and easy to down.. Give Raid bosses more health, Hit a bit harder. Make it challenging and scale it to the modern wow player today. We know the classes, Bosses. Lets make them at least more difficult for us.

\-Premade/Pugs- I think it would be for the better to have Premades/Premades Pugs/Pugs Maybe give it a rating system for premades for some incentive... kinda like RBG's (Just a quick idea) but Classic ATM is a gongshow with PVP. its either do a premade or don't PVP. Sure it helps socialize. but for someone who can't get into premades because they are full of warriors. He shouldn't be penalized for solo ques.  Regardless, We have Arena coming and its going to be AMAZING...

Classic Was great. We went with ""No Changes"" i feel the Classic Community is a lot more foot down that TBC and are much larger of a community than TBC players. In the end i think everyone would agree some changes would of been better... im a TBC&gt;Classic guy and i know they need to change a few things or it will be horde dominated and ill be stuck in 2hr WSG or arena ques.

TBC will be a FANTASTIC experience non the less and will do great. i personally cannot wait.. If you haven't played TBC. You should.. its an extension of classic without ruining anything. (Fight me on the flying mount topic WPVP is just 90%ganking anyways)",75,1585506593,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fram3d/with_tbc_on_its_way_a_few_things_need_to_change/,classicwow,0

Classic wow is so good because everything in it is current content.

fr7qql,TheFleshIsDead,How I think classic WoW should be developped,"Please vote accordingly if you agree or disagree with most points.   

* Don't  homogenize the classes , for example Warriors are harder to level and pay off for that later on. Spriests in pvp require a warlock to even them out.

* Don't add 1v1 balance  

* Don't add more levels or spells  

* Don't make current ilvl skippable later on by nerfing content or making it irrelevant.  

* Do add higher ilvl gear  

* Do add more dungeons   

* Do add Arena  

* Do not add flying mounts  

* Do add Mythic gear and content that is LUCK based to get and skill based to beat.  

* Don't change the talent tree's except to MAYBE for example make Boomkin viable or Ele better for levelling. In other words balance between trees not classes.

* Do improve the graphics such as tesselation and higher res textures.  

* Do focus on music sound tracks.  

* MAYBE add more classes and races.  

Keep the game focused on the effort to power achievement with a high skill cap and drawn out time consumption rather than mixing things up as is done in retail. This is called The Power Process and is inherent in human nature, you are catering to your current player base rather than trying to broaden your player base and bringing old players back.

fr76xb,TefTheTauren,The financial reason why pre-made only queues (or any such solutions) need to be considered,"In management consulting they use a technique called MECE to approach business problems. It stands for mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. I've tried to apply a MECE view of the current state of PvP in classic wow. 

There are two mutually exclusive options for classic wow PvP 

1. Keep the system as is. Leaving a certain amount of players demotivated to queue for PvP, instead to focus on raid logging or dungeons. I'm not going to argue why they are demotivated - but we can all agree there is a trend downwards in number of people queueing for bgs.
This risks player attrition (E.g. X % of players will  eventually quit the game due to their enjoyment in the remaining aspects of the game [raids/dungeons] not being enough to justify their sub)

2. Change the system (e.g. allow for pre-made only queues and solo queues). Many Rankers will undoubtedly swap to solo queueing due to honour per hour - But will they quit? Potentially they may quit the ranking grind but will they unsub? Given Rankers are hardcore players I personally doubt they would unsub. But let's say they do (Y%). 

Finally you have Dev costs (C) that blizzard needs to pay in order to implement a change like pre-made only queues.

So what?

So what blizzard needs to assess is , what is financially greater?
 is X &gt; Y + C?

The x % of people quitting PvP currently and then quitting the game completely, or the y % of people that may quit the PvP grind and then quit the game completely. (Don't forget to add the C for cost here).

I would put my money on X . Rankers might cry for a week, but the fact that they are so try hard makes me think  they're less likely to unsub. This is a cost based view of the problem (X, y and c are all negatives to the balance sheet). I didn't include the potential upsides either (1. Could bring back players 2. Doesn't really bring any new subs)

To me this is logically sound - but I hope you can please provide feedback",14,1585494155,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fr76xb/the_financial_reason_why_premade_only_queues_or/,classicwow,1

fr5zxh,huusmuus,Let's do the math: Request for Crowd Sourcing of Home Schooling Maths Excercises,"I have two school kids at home that should practice some maths (my opinion) while schools are shut down. They argue that raw numbers without context are boring. So I thought it might be interesting to let them do some calculations related to this game.

The goal is obviously not to gain useful insights or to reflect game mechanics overly realistically, but to add some context to basic maths.

Examples:

* A Rockjaw Trogg has 60 health points. Every two seconds you can cast a fireball that does 15 damage. You have 100 health points. Every 2.5 seconds the Trogg hits you for 15 damage.
   * How many attacks do you need to kill it? 
   * How much health do you have by the end of the fight?
* The cast duration of your Frostbolt is 1.8 seconds. It does 35 damage. Your Lesser Magic Wand does 11.33 damage per second. 
   * How do you do more damage?
* It takes 15 seconds to run to Orgrimmar by foot. If you use your mount, you can run 60% faster, but first you need to summon it for 3 seconds.
   * How much earlier (or later) do you arrive using the mount.
* You are a druid, and you can instantly cast Travel Form, which makes you 40% faster than running.

fr5t5e,pinkstab,Cmon let's separate more wows,"I can't wait to wotlk classic, where we will have exclusive servers for classic, tbc, wotlk, BfA, Shadowlands and retail!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but I think that the servers shouldn't separate. We would have 3 wows by the time

The population in the last years has not been very high, and dividing it by 3... adn by and 5 in the future...

&amp;#x200B;

And other thing: Ok, let's imagine we have a ""1.12 forever"" server. What are you going to do when anybody of your guild does not wanna go to Naxxramas because everybody has full gear/bises? PvP? with BiS people? Where the game changes to see who is the fastest oneshotting another one?

&amp;#x200B;

C'mon, of course I would love to have a forever vanilla server, but in 1-2 years it would be boring as hell (everybody can see that) and a lot of people would left the server. Now imagine in 5 years, with cataclysm classic, where people will be asking about a Classic Classic. It will be the same again.

fr50ck,oddiz4u,TBC would be the beginning of the end. How are people not seeing that?,"I say this as someone who played Vanilla way back in the day through WotLK. I played classic for a few months, but have since stopped for my own personal reasons. If Classic moved to TBC, nothing would change for me.

The idea of accepting \*any\* variation of TBC is just... the beginning of the end. It means the players have cosigned Blizzard to repeating the expansions until the inevitable lack of interest. We know how everything progresses. We know where this leads. Why would we want this again? 

I'd love to see if there was a survey about potential alternative after classic (Classic +) but my guess is that's such a large overhead investment from Acti-Blizz, and Classic is just an easy source of income.

The fact that now talk of Classic's future is just.... variations of TBC servers, or how transfers would be handled... is really saddening.

So many fought to bring Classic here, it'd be a shame if everyone already became so comfortable with Blizz' handling of things that it's just accepted TBC is the only option to come. TBC means every other expansion in line, until not enough are playing, and they pull the plug on it.

fr07dc,therealnaut,My Case For Fresh Characters - Classic TBC,"Hello, I would like to share with you my thoughts on why I feel TBC server should be a fresh start for anyone who chooses to participate.

I am now 31 years old, I have played world of warcraft off and on since vanilla, coming back at least a short time for each expansion.

Playing the game as long as I have I have seen it take on many different forms over time, some of those catering more toward the casual players, some of them catering more toward the hardcore players.

I now have many commitments outside of gaming, which is an unfortunate reality for many people other than myself as well. When classic vanilla released I was extremely happy, I knew the game would be a massive hit and I was really looking forward to people getting to experience the game in it's original state. However I knew that my life at this stage was far too busy to commit to playing seriously, although I would have loved to do so; so I thought if I could not take it seriously as I would like I would just not play at all rather than feel I was dragging my friends down with me.

TBC is much more casual-friendly, you are able to log on for shorter amounts of time and do things like arenas and raid-logging. It is in my opinion the best state the game has ever been in from the view of player quality of life. 

Had Blizzard stated from the beginning they planned to roll out classic, and then TBC, and then whatever else they choose, then sure I understand offering character copies or transfers. However for people like myself who knew they did not have the time for classic and chose to forego playing, we are now at a massive disadvantage vs those who did play. Had this been something I knew perhaps I would have made some time to level up a character and be more prepared.

To those people who did play classic, or are still playing, your character is not going anywhere. Those classic servers will remain as a trophy for you to always look back on. A true gamer should want to play on a level playing field against people whom have the same chance for success as they do.

TLDR; I feel this is punishing those who did not choose to play classic but would like to play TBC.",56,1585457797,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fr07dc/my_case_for_fresh_characters_classic_tbc/,classicwow,1

fqz3ma,eggyyboi,Worth it to level to 60 to prepare for BC?,"I hate to admit it but my interest in classic is dwindling as of late. like many people i’ve found myself on a raid logging schedule lately after being slightly let down by bgs and having farmed all the gold i really need. I still love classic and look forward to more phases but i have definitely been spending time on other games lately. 

So the question is should i level a character to 60 just on the off chance that BC servers end up going the character copy from classic route that seems so popular. I currently have a 60 hunter and shaman but don’t want to be tied to those classes in BC or leveling way behind the curve on my potential new mains when BC releases? 

I know the smart move is to wait for more info but my current 60s took me 10 and 12 days of /played to get and i really want to have a hunter and warlock ready for when BC does hit. With the timeline of classic feeling way more accelerated than i expected and me not having an insane amount of play time during the week i am feeling the pressure to get a head start while also dreading the grind. 

tl;dr i want two more 60s by the time BC comes out if the servers even do allow character copies and wondering when the right time to start leveling them is? as someone who mainly plays arenas will i even feel far behind if i don’t hit level cap with everyone else, unlike raiders who could miss weeks of progression and loot ?

fqyfxu,sanklin98,Future of WoW Classic| Alternate Universe,"I'm not sure what Blizzard's plans for Classic are, but it seems to me like if they let Classic stagnate on the final patch, they'll end up losing a significant number of their player base again. It seems to me like the logical step would be to re-release TBC, but I think they could do better. As much as Classic has been a huge nostalgia trip for me, and so would TBC and WotLK, I think they should move into an Alternate timeline universe (not like Warlords of Draenor). The main problem I have with retail WoW, is it seems to be so cluttered with confusing layers of piled on expansions. The last time I played retail, I felt like I was overwhelmed with the content and felt like I could not keep up and was being left behind. Re-releasing the expansions would be going down that same path. 

What makes sense to me (not from an ease of development stand point), is to start an Alternate Universe of sorts. Possibly you could follow similar story beats from the other expansions, but with a bigger focus on keeping a Classic feel.

For example; a lower level cap raise of say 65, Outland is more of a raiding zone/dungeon zone for tier sets (making the release not devalue your gear automatically with greens and blues), heavy story focus (with the opportunity to retcon and clear up some muddling/confusing story aspects), no flying mounts, try to make certain class identities that are un-viable in Classic (Balance Druid, Enhancement Shaman as a tank, Survival Melee Hunter) actually fill a stronger role. Maybe Enhancement Shamans get the ability to wear plate, Hunters give up their range attack power for melee attack power, Balance Druids have enough Mana. Other people with more knowledge than me could figure it out better than I could.

I guess the main goal is to not overwhelm people with content like BFA does. Keep strong class identities that have their uniqueness (some classes simply can't do things that others can). Make Hybrid classes more valuable and tie some dungeon/raid mechanics to specific mechanics. Slow things down and keep a strong story. Maybe expansions up to WotLK could roll out as normal, but instead of Cataclysm (a huge blow for WoW playerbase), start an AU.

Instant 60 is also out of the question. Its an mmo not csgo.

The only viable option; keep a few classic servers where people can migrate/copy their chars if they want to stay in naxx forever. Then release tbc on the current servers.

fqxmqy,Wowfanperson,Classic+ Should have been a alternative expansion that was a improved version of TBC,"Title. I know people are excited about TBC, and some people arn't, however my opinion is basically, sure TBC will be entertaining maybe for a couple months and I don't really care that much. But if they wanted to genuinely improve on WoW, then classic wow should have been followed into a alternative TBC that wasn't well.. The same thing we know we are heading into.

&amp;#x200B;

The issues of flying mounts will be there which will make the world feel dead once people start getting their epic mounts, druid and warlocks will be OP af, the content will then persist as arenas mainly, everyone will detest eye of the storm and the que for it will be forever, AV/WSG/AB will be played mainly WSG/AB depending on which one has the big honor day, game will shrink into teleporting into raid/teleport into arena, people will gradually lose interest.

&amp;#x200B;

fqxc85,Malagus,BC servers will fundamentally change Classic servers and you are lying to yourself if you don't think so.,"First off: I really enjoy BC. It is my personal favorite expansion. However, regardless of how Blizzard launches this thing, if you want to avoid BC and stay on your classic server that you have grown to love, here's the bad news: it's over. It won't matter how people transfer over to BC; your old classic server will drop population like a rock. The population will be so low as to be unsustainable. Trying to clear AQ40 or Naxx? It won't happen.  BGs? Enjoy the 2-3 hour wait times.

After a few months, Blizz might merge servers together but even then, the unique personality your server had is gone forever. So, enjoy classic while you can. BC is coming and even if you choose to not jump on that train, you will still be snuffed out by it's furious passage.",22,1585446028,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fqxc85/bc_servers_will_fundamentally_change_classic/,classicwow,0
fqxacq,Streetguru,TBC Classic Should just use a Phasing/Parallel Universe system,"The easy option is just to have a system in the game where you can bring your character forward in or back in time on the same realm almost at will. Dunno if there should be a building/area you have to go to first with a new hearthstone, or if it's something done on the character selection screen, 2nd one is a lot easier of course. Although 2nd option may lead to some exploits, 1st is probably safer.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be really simple to have a system that catalogs your items and changes them to their TBC versions if brought forward, or places them in a void storage bank thing should you go back in time to vanilla where they didn't exist.  Scaling your character back to the old level cap and all of that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

fqx61u,mongoosepepsi,"Option for TBC Classic that was not listed, continue characters to TBC Servers, fresh Classic servers.","I'm trying to think of this in a way that allows players to progress to TBC but still enjoy classic. If they release WoTLK servers in the future, I would like to see players that choose to play on either a Classic, TBC, or Wrath server. 

For this instance, when TBC Classic comes out, all existing servers will be converted to TBC. In a perfect world, dead servers should be culled off and the players given the option to transfer to a healthy server. My suggestion is to start fresh. All the existing classic servers will rebrand as TBC servers with names such as ""Vashj"", ""Kael'thas"", ""Pathaleon"". Some servers should merge because of low pops, and in case some huge servers are overpopulated, Blizzard can implement layering again. In my anecdotal experience, the layering experience was not that bad. TBC Layering will eventually relieve itself.

For those who want to play Classic, the question begs, do we allow copies of everyone's characters on classic servers, allow transfers or start from fresh? To deal with Classic, we will have a new slate of Classic servers. The classic servers can maintain the names we have been used to, however not all will survive and why would they? Far less players would be playing on classic as the community gets split between 2 versions of the game. Classic servers probably will not need layering or even as many servers.",6,1585445397,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fqx61u/option_for_tbc_classic_that_was_not_listed/,classicwow,1

I was thinking the fastest way would be getting boosted through dungeons but I’m a little unsure on some things. What level can you start getting boosted? What dungeons would I need to get boosted through to get up to 35? I’m assuming deadmines at 15, stocks at 20, and then the scarlet monasteries to 35?? Is that correct?


I doubt anyone has done the math but I would be curious to see how much it would cost to get two characters boosted all the way up to 35 through dungeons. I may just dualbox them and quest or AoE grind them to level up (assume mage or Hunter)

A few things:

- The gear being compared will be for a mage using these gear lists: [Naxx gear](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/best-in-slot/mage/?phase=6); [TBC Pre-Bis Gear](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-XO9N1_MPIq-UIpTN13LrhXRoho9fe26YEEM48QmPk/edit#gid=1123366023)

- The Naxx gear values shown were found using the TbcDB database

- The TBC gear was picked with some certain factors: it had to be found in a dungeon or from a quest, and it had the highest EP according to the spreadsheet. So this gear isn't ideally set-up around hit cap, but was picked with the intent of showing the relative power of the items sets.

Here is a screenshot of the spreadsheet comparing the item sets: [Spreadsheet](https://i.imgur.com/Y0eHuXo.png)

This table shows that Naxx gear (for mages at least) is more than viable all the way to 70. It will not simply be out scaled by a majority of items you find early on in leveling. I would have to look through other gear sets to see if the comparisons are similar, but I would assume this trend would hold for other classes.",178,1585436217,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fqum5e/comparing_naxx_bis_gear_vs_tbc_prebis_gear/,classicwow,9

Why? Because for many of us that will play Blood Elf or Draenei, especially Paladins and Shamans, we'd certainly like to experience the launch event on the characters and have a chance for the tabard on the characters that will be our mains.

fqovtf,Thrall_Frostwolf,Could It Be?,"So I was reading the option on a poll from a fellow redditeer. I thought to myself that his options were pretty basic. They consisted of BC with xfer option or BC. I was thinking to myself what I want is development of vanilla. 

They are reverting the cap back to 60 and in my mind it would be the perfect time to duel develop classic and retail. Using classic as a base you could balance retail and classic player would get to play new content on a different level. I would love to see a gnomer, Ungro pylon, and Dalaran raids. If that were the case It might even get me back into retail just so I could test new class combos stuff in content I already love.

So far in classic the changes that they did make I felt were bad, or maybe just missed opportunities. When the ranked system was added we knew we were suppose to world pvp, but we didn't really have the proper tools modern games have to actually world pvp like comtags for one. In turn world pvp melted down into flightpath farming. I also felt that giving out rank 14 welfare epics to botters was painful for the game as a whole, and trivialized bwl. The last big issue I see in the future is using the nax version of the zg arcaniums quest. This takes away the only value some of these items would ever see I just hate destructive development. (I personally lost a few thousand gold investment on this lol)

So in closing I would like to see duel development of classic and retail. Am I the only one?, Would it work?, and where should Azeroth go next?",4,1585417893,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fqovtf/could_it_be/,classicwow,0

Although this is ***purely speculation,*** Blizzard has created a track history that we can make assumptions from:

* Arena would likely be plagued by the same artificial spell batching mechanic that they thought Classic needed.
* It's likely that Blizzard would give us the 2.4.3 patch (much like they gave us 1.12.1) which means 2 highly note able call outs: Haste change and nerfed Gruul, Magtheridon, Serpentshrine Cavern, Tempest Keep, Karazhan, Heroics, etc.
* TBC launched with Gruul, Magtheridon, Serpentshrine Cavern, Tempest Keep, and Hyjal on launch. If content is not gated that means it's likely we'll see the try hard of try hard's clearing all the way through Hyjal within the first month of release. The attunement's aren't enough to keep them from clearing content that was cleared in 2006-2007 in partial T3 gear.
* It's likely we'll receive the same kind of quality communication/game addressing issues that we've received with Classic.
* Blizzard arguably did not demonstrate the trials and tribulations that other iterations of the project that came before Classic. Repeating mistakes and opportunities which were addressed by amateur project enthusiasts. It's likely we'll see the same type of behavior from Blizzard for ""Classic TBC"".  


And if you thought Vanilla's meta of Warrior humping with Engineering was dull. Swap Warrior's for Hunters and swap Engineering for Leatherworking. Stack Armor Penetration. It really isn't much of a change. \~1-2 tanks, \~5 Resto Shamans, \~9-10 Hunter's. Ezgame.  


Dial back your hype, but still be excited. Recognize how and what exactly ""Classic TBC"" could end up being. It may or may not be what you're envisioning.",3,1585414674,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fqnvf4/tbc_survey_and_blizzard/,classicwow,0
fqnola,akoria,The Case for Looting Everything,"**__The Case for Looting Everything__**

When you are solo?  Absolutely!  Why would you pass up free loot on corpses you spent time killing?  This helps to recover repair costs for your own adventures in the wild.

When you are in a 5-person group?  If you do not loot everything, every time, you pass up loot for the rest of the group.  Because all coin-loot is shared equally, this means you are passing up loot for everyone else, including yourself. 

Example scenario:  There are 200 kills in Dungeon X.  Every fifth kill is yours to loot.  This is 40 pickups at an average of 15s per loot (3s per person).  The math equals **1g20s per person that gets lost if you ignore picking up loot** while in a 5-person group.  Not to mention people who skill professions as “skinners” that will not be able to exercise their skilled profession in picking up the loot that is blocked from not clearing the loot.  This scenario is a REALLY LOW estimate of what you are missing out on, often you pass up greens or blues if you don’t loot the corpses.  This can be a direct benefit for you to sell items at AH or disenchant for materials used for enchantments.  

When you are in a 40-person raid?  If you do not check the loot after every kill (yes, even trash mobs) this slows down raid progression.  People who have the task of skinning items for the benefit of the guild have to call out and wait for loot to be claimed in order for the mobs to be skinned for the benefit of the guild (think: Core Hounds, dragons, etc.).  

Everything costs money:  repairs, consumables, gear, time.  Please make sure to either check every kill, every time, OR use the “pass on loot” option available to you when you are in a group.  Thanks!

fqmx73,pandixon,I don't see how either transfer or copy can be a good option for the future.,"So let's think about it. People were complaining, that the demographics and server sizes were messed up in classic. This also kind of breaks the economy.
Right now a lot of people talk about, how begin new at the current state is difficult with fewer people having a real leveling experience, so your own fresh level experience is influenced by this as well. Also if you always just keep your char, what is your long term goal? What is the motivation to even continue playing? Getting more gold, while gold will be worth less and less because of the constant inflation?
Thing is, with fresh classic servers, things can be done right. Smaller sized servers, faction based login quees and most important only people playing Classic, who care about classic. This is a real chance to build up communities, who care for just their community.
One step further for me would even be, having new servers for both, classic and tbc, but I guess there are not many for this option.",6,1585411506,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fqmx73/i_dont_see_how_either_transfer_or_copy_can_be_a/,classicwow,1

fqks8p,Lexidus,Looking For a Group to play WoW together,"Hello guys!  


I'm new in here, so I would like to welcome everyone - both the experienced and new (soon to be experienced) players.  


After binge watching MadSeasonShow's videos (highly recommended) I would like to get into WoW Classic...but I  don't want to do it alone. That's why I am asking you guys - would somebody like to join me for my journey through Azeroth?   
I have some experience playing WoW, mostly on private servers. I have never reached endgame though, mostly due to not sticking to one class for a long enough time :D. 

I would like to create a small group (i.e. greater than or equal to 2) of people to play WoW together. Ideally I would like to use a voice chat while playing, to talk about some interesting topics, to not only learn about the world of Warcraft but also about the real world (yes, but it does still exist). 

As far as some game specific info goes: I would like to play on a medium - high populated realm in the EU. Most probably horde: either an Orc Rogue or Orc Warlock. I am a causal player, so I would mostly be able to play during night hours (for me it's after 7 P.M/ 19:00 CET) for about 2 - 3 hours. 

Some personal info (in case you had similar interests): My native language is Polish. I am a *cognitive science* student and my interests are (broadly speaking): philosophy, music, human physiology, game development and entrepreneurship.

It's quarantine time here in the EU so hey...why not use it to have fun together?",2,1585404366,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fqks8p/looking_for_a_group_to_play_wow_together/,classicwow,1

fqjwtf,Polynikez,Blizzard. We need to talk.,"**I'm furious.** And let me explain why.

If you aren't already aware. Blizzard recently sent out a  TBC survey email. 
(See Below)

https://imgur.com/a/5BYOLNH

This was a massive leap in the wrong direction.

By blindsiding the community with TBC server expansion proposals. Blizzard has completely SKIPPED over the important community discussions that we still have not had. We all thought that the time for  discussion would come when all of Vanilla content was released. But apparently that isn't the case.

What discussions am I getting at?

Whether or not the **Classic Player-Base** WANTS a TBC expansion in the first place. 

Blizzard needs to gather the community as a whole and find out what we can all agree on is the best direction to take the future of WoW classic. 

What happened to the talks of: 
* ""Classic +"" 
* ""TBC Expansion"" 
* ""TBC (minus flying, class balance changes)
* ""WOTLK Expansion""

ect.

They just cut us all out and jumped straight into ""Yeah we think TBC expansion is the right call"".

I personally have always been a strong advocate for the ""Classic +"" camp. It worked very, very well with Old School Runescape. And there is no reason why WoW classic cannot follow the same outline. I want **EVERYONES** voices to be heard for what **they think** is best for the future. If it's TBC then perfect! That's awesome. But I want for **US** to come to the conclusion that TBC is the right choice. ***NOT BLIZZARD*.**


Blizzard. Seriously. *You haven't even finished Vanilla yet* but you're already started talks of TBC servers? You completely left us alienated and left out.

So, 

Instead of polling a new expansions on us. Can we please take a step back, and open a community wide discussion on what is actually right for progression?",49,1585401054,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fqjwtf/blizzard_we_need_to_talk/,classicwow,1

fqey9j,VirginRant,The Burning Crusade: The Solution Is So Simple,"I'll try to keep this short and sweet. There is only one way and one way ONLY that Classic:TBC will be remotely viable. It is to have an entirely new server that cannot interact with current classic in any way, and you start at level 1. It's the only way and I can explain it pretty easily.

1) Having a TBC server that allows for transfers/copies of existing characters in current classic will cleave the community in half or even more. Furthermore, all the great gear offered in classic will be al.ost instantaneous outdone but level greens. Nobody wants that, and it was kind of a ""Fuck You"" when we had to experience it the first time.

2) Having a totally separate server is the only way to do it. This server cannot interact with Classic in any way. If it could, then what's the point and where does it end? All we did was just reset a franchise of terrible expansions. Everyone being level 1 will be a fresh, new and fun way to experience TBC. You're gear you grinded for will not become obsolete because you never grinded on the new level 1 toon.

3) Having two totally separate, uniteractable servers means you can play classic when you want, or play TBC when you want. Having anything but would be a totally muddled mess. You can enjoy your classic on its server and enjoy your TBC on its server, respectively. Of course, they would have to implement a way to start every race/class combination from a starting point which might be tricky, because having horde flood the Belf starting zone would be bad. If they can't somehow find a way to do this, they don't deserve our money in the first place.

Again, I'm sure there are a lot of people who disagree and want some time of copy system that keeps your existing character but this can not work. It would just be playing through the Xpacs again, Who wants to do that? There are several reasons why having 2 completely separate and non-interchangeable realms has to be the case. Some people might even like the free lvl 58 option, but this feels like an unearned character in my mind and just feels like how they approached the Death Knight, which was fucking terrible. Remember? Starting a DK that was already wearing blues, but the tier or rarity might as well been epic or legendary since it was earned at all anyway. I'd love to hear people's thoughts on the matter. I know missing out on stepping through the portal to Outlands on your current toon will be missed, but it has to be this way. Can't you see? Fresh new economy, character, levelling to the new 70 cap is how it has to be. Balanced for all, with zero fuckery to be had. I didn't think people would even have to think about this.

Basically you allow copying of characters to the tbc server, BUT the only things you allow 'through' the transfer are soulbound items and NO gold.

I think this is a pretty good solution. You make gold much faster in TBC, so for 'normal' players it won't be a very big deal walking through the dark portal with 0g. Only allowing soulbound gear prevents people from skirting the gold limit with the few vanilla items that would actually still hold value and be useful in tbc.

This is a good solution to me because it keeps the part that actually matters intact: your character and their gear.",52,1585375052,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fqehc0/asmongolds_potential_solution_to_concerns_of/,classicwow,1

I've been running a traditional 24/0/27 Moonglow build (especially for raid healing) but I'm kind of tired of feeling defenseless when I get jumped left and right. I can transform into bear form but I barely tickle people as is and I can't really get away.

I was thinking of going 08/13/31 (I could be off one or two numbers), basically picking up feral charge and going down to Swiftmend, but I've seen several Druids running a build very similar to the one I linked. Never thought of doing this before. Would this be worth it for open world farming/PvP/do you think I'd actually notice a difference, or should I go swiftmend?

I really want a different build for PvP but also don't want to respec every week for raid. I tried 0/30/21 (HOTW/NS) and I wasn't a fan/felt like I was missing too much in the resto tree in raids, so I don't like going anything less than 27 in Resto.

I went Horde side and currently have a 60 Undead Warlock, full gear from MC/Ony. Spend most of my time when I’m not raiding doing DM Jump runs and AV. 

While sitting in a queue I realized that playing through on Horde side gave me a certain view/lens on the game. I’d like to experience that from the Alliance side as well and was wondering what race and class I should play. I want to be able to explore the Alliance zones and stories to kinda get the full WoW experience on the other side.

fpkqse,Pygex,Unpopular opinion: Horizontal progress is good,"Now, before I start. I know that TBC is a very likely follow up on the Classic based on how the current Activision-Blizzard is clearly drifted towards easy money with zero effort as it is extremely lucrative.   

However, I strongly hope for that in the respect of the original developers, Activision-Blizzard would have the courage to take on a different path with current Classic as they now have 2 versions of the game, one that is more in line with modern micro transaction theme park (providing them the constant stream of money) and the other that is somewhere between a hardcore (EQ) and a casual MMO.  

**TLDR**  

Classic is the perfect platform to experiment on horizontal progress. This means new content should offer more stat combination options, more different set bonuses, more unique class effects for weapons and armour as well as more/alternative talents, talent trees, spells and abilities, locked behind the additional end game content.  

This is easier for balance, the stats will not need to be purged and all that powerful gear can and should be kept as hard to obtain as there is no risk of the gear being invalidated in the future. Getting new gear would feel rewarding as it opens more build diversity and different play styles but old gear and the time commitment used for them is not for nothing.  

**TLDR end**  

We know that the original developers stated that flying mounts in TBC was a mistake. Therefore I truly hope that instead of the vertical progression system that the WoW uses in retail version we would actually get a horizontal progression system for Classic, as Activision-Blizzard is quite safe to experiment on it due to their golden goose retail WoW.  

The problem with modern MMOs is that with each expansion, they turn up the number knobs and increase levels and talents. This creates a balance chaos every now and then and also invalidates all the progress a player has done during “end game”.  

In my opinion, Classic should have a horizontal expansion system. Instead of just bloating the stats, add content that improves the build diversity not content that increases the maximum character power.  

Let raids bring gear with more different set bonuses, opening up more playstyles. Add dungeons that offer class weapons and armour with unique playstyle changing effects like the Wolfshead helm but with end game stats. Add long class quests that unlock completely new or alternate talents, talent trees, spells or skills.  

Opening up build diversity will bring incentive for the players to tackle on the new content. Some may want to only collect the gear, some may like to try their favourite class with a different spin on it. 

How would a support shout based warrior play like? What about a melee hunter? Perhaps even offer some classes unique talent trees based on their race, like a priest of elune tree for elves and voodoo for trolls?  

In my opinion, this is the proper way to expand a game, because then the time commitment of the players for those hard earned items are still noted while the game will still feel *fresh*.",31,1585260354,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fpkqse/unpopular_opinion_horizontal_progress_is_good/,classicwow,2

fpjrn0,gommerthus,Dear wonderful mages doing SM Carries.,"First of all, **Thank you**.

I understand the rates have gone up - what was once 3G, is now 5G. Which makes sense, because all of you needed time to follow the Arlaeus guides on Youtube, locate that safe ledge/spot, investing in frost resist gear to reduce the RNG, etc etc.


Your technical ability to execute the ""1 pull SM"" is not up for debate. I see deaths quite often due to bad luck, unfortunate human error, etc etc. All that is understandable. Sometimes it's not really ""1 pull"" but...whatever, right? As long as XP/hour is high and justifies the 5g/run(some of you do both cath/amory, some *only* cath for 5g).

What I'm about to say next is going to get a few of you hot under the collar. **I do not wish to anger anyone here**. I just want to help, because much of the drama generated on these runs are all solvable by *clear communication*:

Be clear about what service you're providing. I've seen the following so far:

- 5G for cath/amory. Some mages do only the top floor of armory, while others do a *massive* pull, lead everything to the top floor and kill it all.

- 3G for less experienced mages who are still learning the ropes. That's fine.

But let me say this. When you're charging for your services, It would be to everyone's benefit, to keep this part, **standardized**. Meaning:

You charge your customers upfront, *before any pull begins*. Meaning - you do not lift a finger, unless everyone's paid up. Should anyone refuse to pay, then they get the boot.

I don't like the method of running first, then asking payment after the run. This invites the opportunity of people ghosting you.

I've had one lovely mage who I paid at the start of Cath, he ran the instance, and then after armory was done, suddenly quiz everyone that two people didn't pay him. He looked at me, and I said I did, and he sarcastically replied ""yeah sure"" and promptly logs.

Upon he return, he said ""you missed a payment, imma run with guildies"". Well mage - *that's actually your fault* for not having kept tabs on who paid and who didn't. I know I paid, and I even offered you 20g to make things right, and all I got were crickets.

TLDR: Charge your customers UPFRONT for any SM run. Whatever conditions in the run are completely up to you, eg. no loot for anyone, you get everything, etc etc. Whatever. You're benefactor for everyone and we appreciate your time, don't get me wrong.

But please get the logistics right.

Signed, a player who's going to login to his mage and start doing SM carries too.",25,1585257086,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fpjrn0/dear_wonderful_mages_doing_sm_carries/,classicwow,2

My name is Jessica Robinson, and I am an assistant professor and researcher at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on social and emotional experiences in video games – who we play with, who we talk to, and how we play while socializing. I’ve been playing *World of Warcraft* myself since just after *The Burning Crusade* launched.

I’m looking for current players of *World of Warcraft* to participate in a study about players’ experiences in Azeroth. This research study focuses on the emotional connections that *World of Warcraft* players develop within the world of Azeroth – connections to their personal experiences, to their fellow players, and to Azeroth itself. If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to fill out a survey that asks about your experiences in *World of Warcraft*, the specific *World of Warcraft* content you play, and basic demographic information. This research will help video game scholars better understand the emotional connections that players form with video game worlds; this knowledge can improve game design and user experience in the future!

I am looking for current players of *World of Warcraft Battle for Azeroth* AND current players of *World of Warcraft Classic* to participate in this study. You might be a player of just *Battle for Azeroth*, just *Classic*, or both! 

Participation is voluntary, and all of your responses and information will be kept confidential. You must be a current player of *World of Warcraft* (*Battle for Azeroth* AND/OR *Classic*) and 18 years of age or older to participate. If you’re interested in participating, have any questions, or want more information, please feel free to get in touch with me via email (jrobinson@kutztown.edu)

fphdlk,ph3l0n,"Pre-Mades need to be removed or forced to fight only other pre-mades, it is unfair to low pop servers.","Some of the smaller servers are dying and or dead for some factions.  Those of us on smaller servers don't even have enough people ranking to get 10 people together to even form a pre-made.  This unfortunately makes it so we have to 5 man, or solo queue.  We have no ability to to muster a group large enough to group queue and even have a chance against pre-made.

* The amount of coordination advantage that voice chat vs randoms typing is massive.  
* The ability to stack groups where you are guaranteed to have healers is a massive advantage.

There is almost no pug that can beat a premade unless that premade is absolutely terrible.  There is little to no chance even a group of 5 has against a group of 15 who are coordinated.  This was an issue in WSG / AV and now in AB.  I would gladly wait in a separate queue if that means I could avoid Pre-Mades.  Waiting 20 minutes to get ass stomped in under 6 netting almost ZERO honor is GARBAGE design.  Smaller servers get absolutely screwed by this design.  

Since you (Blizztard) refuse to merge servers, refused to limit servers with regards to population balance at launch, you need to start fixing the parts of the game that necessitate group play and having a larger number of players to make it relevant.

**Possible Resolutions**

* Break up the queues to match faction size.
* Force 5 man groups only (optimal)
* Remove Pre-Mades all together
* Merge servers where faction balancing is bad to even things out
* Make Pre-Mades only fight Pre-Mades",12,1585249170,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fphdlk/premades_need_to_be_removed_or_forced_to_fight/,classicwow,0

Is there a consensus on how much NR (buffed) a tank should be using for each boss?  Are these fights generally like Vael in that NR helps but can be balanced with threat and mitigation pieces as needed?  How much of the overall damage to the tank is physical, as opposed to nature?

As an FYI, I'm an alliance bear tank, if that is relevant.  Also, in case relevant, I seem to be able to get up to about 140 NR or so unbuffed before I start taking a huge nosedive in other stats.

He was also backstabing on previous trash and bosses however on Garr, he took off his dagger/gloves and used blues for gloves and swords. I was salt. I whispered the RL and he ignored me.

I think that it is finally time for me to actually grow up and try a pvp realm. But I don't want to create a character on one to find out that ""oh, would you look at the deadness of this server"". 

I am planning on playing an alliance warlock, so does anyone have any server suggestions?

fpa7fk,MaverickxIceman4ever,Anyone else feel their potential enjoyment of the game is massively limited by respec costs,"I don’t want or expect blizzard to ever implement lower respec costs/dual spec, just looking for discussion. 

I feel like when you bring up the possibility of easier respecs/dual specs people just assume you want the convenience of retail. Yes in retail you can respec at the drop of a hat, but you are very limited in build options when you respec. However classic has so much potential customisation when you respec it’s crazy. 

This is probably why the cost is there in the first place. And I get that a lot of people “like” this because it makes talent choices more meaningful in a sense. But at a certain point I just wanna play the game the way I wanna play without having to budget that into my farming schedule every week. 

Really I just wanna day that it’s deeper than “convenience” or “quality of life”. There’s so much potential fun and customisation contained in the vanilla talent trees that I wish I could tap into without tacking on some extra hours of lasher farms.",381,1585223537,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fpa7fk/anyone_else_feel_their_potential_enjoyment_of_the/,classicwow,1

fp42ky,Grimnak,How Can I Help My Dad Learn?,"Greetings!

My father (in his early 50's) and I decided long before Classic launch we'd play the game super casually due to other commitments in life.  We've had a WoW account for over 10 years and decided this was the time to buy another account to finally play the game together at the same time.  We've been having a lot of fun for the most part, despite only being in the low 40's on our mains.

&amp;#x200B;

To provide more of a background into the types of players we are and how accustomed we are to WoW gameplay mechanics, well, it's about as far as humanly possible.  He started WoW first during TBC and has played very casually ever since.  And by very casually, I mean... very casually.  To put it into perspective, he's never reached level cap in WoW.  Ever.  He's been close a couple of times, but the expansions literally come out faster than he can level cap.  He's dabbled with most every class at some point down the line but I wouldn't say he's ever had a ""main"".

I, on the other hand, play retail daily and participate in mythic raiding (nothing too much, my guild's 6/12 M at the moment Ny'alotha, but it's mythic nonetheless).  I've played mage as my main ever since I started in WotLK.  Needless to say, I'm extremely well versed on my chosen spec, frost.  I was looking for a fresh start in Classic, so I decided to level a druid and have been having a lot of fun with it!

&amp;#x200B;

We figured it'd be best for him to roll a mage since then I could provide him with any knowledge/tips he might need while playing.  It's also a caster so he wouldn't have to worry about melee mechanics quite as much, and my druid could do the tanking/healing, which I'd argue are harder things to do than spamming frostbolt and nova'ing.  Now, when we're questing, everything goes pretty smooth for the most part.  I get slightly annoyed that I still have to call out that he should probably Ice Block here, or Frost Nova this, or Evocate now, polymorph that, etc, when I'm already tanking and healing everything.  But again, this is completely tolerable.

However, what's becoming increasingly intolerable to me and downright depressing at times, is world PvP, if it ever springs up.  Now I know that we're not going to win fights where we're outnumbered or they're higher level (or even the same level, honestly).  But if I'm being honest, we'll go and lose most fights where we have the undeniable advantage.  He just can't react in fights, panics, does nothing to save/help me, and in all honesty, the moment anybody touches him he falls over so fast its hard to watch.  I've tried to coach him with duels on a mage and druid, tell him what he should be watching for, give him tips, etc.  He just isn't putting in the time and as someone with my WoW background, losing fights like this all the time just isn't fun.  I am by no means an expert at druid.  I'm... passable.  This means I cannot be carrying him in fights as it is.  But when you're in bear form and have very little damage output, the mage has got to be able to pressure and peel without falling over (and forgetting to Ice Block in the process).

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any advice for me or him, I'll be sure to pass it on.  The game is phenomenal; I love the old zones, the stories, the atmosphere, and it's just becoming increasingly frustrating carrying 24/7 on a class I'm not as experienced with in a higher-skill situation like PvP.  I truly hope I don't come across as cocky or entitled in this post as that's not my intention.  I'm just looking for help, to be honest.

fp3qvk,Blueduck06,What *exactly* can I do while in AV queue?,"I've never done any PvPing. I tend to like PvE content best but I'm getting close to having enough gold for my epic mount and I just discovered that I can save 100g if I hit rank 3 so I'm giving it a try. I signed on this afternoon and the queue for AV was 2.5 hours. A long time! But I had time and figured I'd just queue for AB and WG while I waited and the time would go by fast enough. I had fun in the other two battlegrounds but I guess the queue timer for other AV pauses while you're in another BG? I didn't realize that and ended up finally getting into AV 4.5 hours after I originally queued. I had the time today, but I'd like to avoid that in the future!

&amp;nbsp;

So what all can I do and not mess up my queue time? Clearly I can't join another BG. Can I run a dungeon? When my turn in the queue comes, if I'm in a group, will I go to the end of the line again? Or will I stay at the front of the line until I get out of a group? Will the AV thing pop up and still ask me if I want to join even in the middle of scholo or whatever? What happens if I ever go akf? Do I get kicked from the queue? What if I'm afk when my turn the queue comes?

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, do I have to literally do nothing else (other than quest or farm or whatever) while waiting for AV? Or do I have options?",10,1585190566,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fp3qvk/what_exactly_can_i_do_while_in_av_queue/,classicwow,1

fp29s5,Sp0ttySniper,With ZG On The Horizon I Remembered Something...,"...with Covid 19 ravaging the world right now I just happened to restumble upon this little gem. I only losely remember it when I first played Classic. I can't help help but wonder if it will come into the game like it was the first time around. With it being the first world event of sorts. It could also give science a 2nd run of the situation and see if people act the same way as the first time.

I also can't help but draw a sort of parallel between trolls and people who aren't taking the pandemic seriously. But the similarity between the Corrupted blood incident and Covid 19, at least to me, seem really striking. Below is a link to the video in question (if its ok).

fp0snp,Brunskii1,Did I scam a BoE from my guild's raid?,"I've been leveling a mage alt.

Two weeks ago, a friend gifted me a Tier 1 Mage belt in the mail. I was level 56 at the time and couldn't equip it - so I stuck it in the bank and continued to farm for the Banthok sash.

This week I got the sash and finally hit 60. My guild allowed me to take my alt in to MC to grab some gear that the raiding mages were passing on. Tier 1 mage belt drops, myself and another mage alt are the only ones who roll, and I win. I instantly equip the item, as is customary in our guild, and finish the raid. 

Later on, I place the original gifted belt for sale on AH from my mage character. Officer in guild sees it and brings it up to the council, who confront and punish me. 

My stance is that what I do with my gold, my purchases and sales, my gifts inbound and out, is my own business. The belt that was gifted to me should be mine to do what I want with. 

I've accepted my punishment from the guild council but have made it clear that I don't 100% agree that what I did was wrong. I can see this from multiple perspectives and am not sure what to think.

During the whole weekend, I met dozens of characters impacted by this bug.

![img](ekmii0lblto41)

I've reported bugs to the developers, I've written a request to suggest resetting an NPC until the devs can work on it. But I only have the right to an automatic response after 4 days about the quests working, and in no case the measures taken about the problem.

**Finally I come to ask for your help.**

If someone have a Horde character on the Amnennar FR server, is it possible for him to help his fellow allies by killing this NPC to allow him to be reset.

This doesn't guarantee that the bug won't happen again, but hopefully it will temporarily unlock the bug until the developers have time to look into the matter.

foolx3,BlurryFaceXO,"""PvP Non-Participation/Exploitation"" Suspension","So I got caught in the suspension wave about 2 weeks ago (1 week suspension) for occasionally afking in AV, served my time and was 97% in to rank 11,  that went back to 61% into rank 11.   
I got my punishment, I now know it is not acceptable as by blizzards new guidelines/standards for battleground instances, fair enough.

This entire week I have been playing pretty much non stop, grinding up honor to make sure I can still reach my rank 12 in the next 2 weeks.  
Late grinding at 1.30 this morning, trying to grind the last honor before reset, saved up a lot of marks in the mailbox to turn them in later when I was quitting my session and going to bed. In the middle of my last AB game for the night, I get dced and met with the ""your account has been suspended, please watch the recieved email for more information"" message.   


This time it is 1 month for the same offense, but I have no idea what they are basing it on this time. I am assuming it must be something I did this week, as my previous actions has already been punished and served, with the 1 week suspension(??). I havent been outed for afking in any bg that I have participated in this week, I havent had a single idle debuff been thrown my way. I have gotten deserter maybe 3-4 times due to irl stuff requiring my attention out of maybe 100s of games.   


Am I missing something? I cant make out from the email what exactly I did that was wrong, no time/date stamps or anything.   
Is this something that gets issued from player BG report or real tickets done  from players towards my character?  


It was shitty the first time with the suspension because I could agree that I had been AFKing alot.   
But when it happens a second time, when I have, to my knowledge, not done anything wrong, it just feels so shitty.   


Is stealthing past the horde chokepoint in AV and wait for other stealthers to help kill LTs a ""afk avoidance"" offense? Or stealthing around in AB trying to ninja cap, or even being stealthed while base defending?  
 

Has anyone else been in this situation and if so how did you get to know what action you actually got punished for?   


All I know is that, 1 month from now same thing is gonna happen when I get back the account and start grinding again... Appreciate any help or information regarding this AFK Avoidance stance blizzard has recently taken actions against.",59,1585135090,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/foolx3/pvp_nonparticipationexploitation_suspension/,classicwow,1

fon0rm,Stale_Buns,Off-Tanking in MC Raids whilst PVPing,"Hey lads, 

So - I was looking for some spec advice. 

I've always enjoyed being a tank. However, these days I don't really have the FIXED times to be a commited raid tank for a guild. (I have plenty of time to play, but not in predictable windows, so I can't really commit to raid time). For that reason, I was going to focus on PVP. 

But, as we all know there's plenty of great pieces for PVP in MC, considering you can't get a PVP wep besides the AV Rep mace until R14. I also quite enjoy helping out my mates by tanking dungeons and also, you can't really enter raids as an Arms dps since you can't use Mortal strike (Unless you just did shit dps with no one noticing/caring). So, I figured if I wanted to be able to OT in some MC raids I would need to invest somewhat in prot. 

With that in mind, I've tried to put together a spec to fit my needs. This isn't about being the most efficient, but rather having a way to be able to reliably join Tier 1 as an offtank once a week whilst also enjoying PVP and not having to carve out gold for respecs - This isn't about being optimal.

(One key question I had is whether defiance over shield block would be best as an OT, I'm not sure how critical threat is to OTs)

He once LFG for BRD as a healer without any res, and I joined as a hunter DPS. Everything went well until we reached the arena. When I said  'hope SGC drops' in group chat, he told us only he could need it. And he kicked me out right before the boss triggered when I disagreed.

And in the following weeks, I kept seeing him LFG with reserving all kinds of things from Treant's Bane to Ace of Beast. I ran into him in IF one day and found him ret spec with SGC and Treant's Bane.

Today I saw him LFM healer/DPS Scholo res all dark runes and all shadow skins. And no surprise when I check the AH for raid consumables, I find him selling dark runes.

Though it's free to choose any playing styles in this game, I don't think it is right for any players to do this kind of thing in WoW. However, on my opinion, there are few we can do to contain such behaviors.

So I come here for advice, what we can do to make these players aware of their behaviors? Or just leave them to continue harming others who are not familiar with this game?

fo9y26,seffMTG,Need help to figure out how to make money for mounts,"Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

Im rolling Dwarf Priest, 31 at this moment, and I have been saving all my money because with the objective of getting my mount on 40 (and also, on 60).

The thing is that  currently I have only like 17g saved up. This is what I am doing right now:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Herbalism (not making much money out of this yet) &amp; Skinning. Skinning is working out well, selling all light and medium leather on AH. At least is some income. At some point will drop skinning to pair herbalism with alchemy ( but I think that I need to go 300 tailoring first because of the BoP robe).

&amp;#x200B;

\- Running as many dungeons as I can and following guides on quests chains and stuff, mainly doing a lot of solo quests.

&amp;#x200B;

So, questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Is there any profitable spot to farm something specific that sells well? For now, Im gonna try farming Crimson and Dreaming Whelps because apparently those are lucrative, but I dont know if that is necessary correct. Im looking for a 31-40 place so I can start ASAP. I currently have the Gravestone Scepter wand, FYI.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Are dungeons profitable at this level (31-40)? Should I be perma-farming dungeons? (even if XP is not good, I kinda feel that the mount at 40 is like a must for solo questing, wich I love doing).

&amp;#x200B;

4) Can someone ELI5 how to get the reputation discount on the mount? Do I need to be exalted with IF or with the gnomes? Also there is a PvP discount, is that one hard to get?

&amp;#x200B;

4) I am missing something here? Because if not, at this rate I think that Im not getting a mount until 40+. Some people told me in other post about creating swiftness potion with the help of an alchemist, gonna try this too.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not new to the Priest class, it has been my main from TBC through MoP, and I've leveled many alt priests on various servers over the years. But low level healing seems a lot rougher in Classic.

I'm Holy spec up to Holy Nova, and the rest in Disc. I'm wearing mostly level ~30s ""of the whale"" gear with spirit/int and using the blue staff from DM as my weapon. The biggest issue I'm having is mana. I've been mostly using renew + rank 3 lesser healing wave to keep the tank alive, and using renews and various ranks of Heal to spot heal other party members to take damage. I've been following the 5 second rule and only casting max rank Heal when absolutely neccessary to heal through big damage, and using PW:S and Flash Heal strictly for dire emergencies. I still feel like I go OOM in 5 casts.

I've also done some BGs and I have a real hard time surviving. I feel like I cant keep myself alive through a Warrior, Rogue, or Hunter- PW:S + a couple Flash Heals and I'm completely OOM. And I feel like squishiest class in the game by far. Please tell me this improves at 60, because I made this character specifically for PvP/BG purposes as my PvP healer. 

Anyone have any other tips for low level healing. Is there a certain rank that's better to use at this level, or am I using the wrong spec for this? Any help is appreciated!",33,1585069739,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fo8qrs/low_level_priest_healing_tips/,classicwow,1

We do BWL first and I parse 85-90 on pretty much every fight with no consumables and only Ony buff for like 1/2 of it.  Everything seems to be going well, their class lead thinks I'm doing well and their best warrior actually PM'ed me with praise on my performance after the run.

We do MC the next day and a BB drops, I expect one of the other Warriors to get it (DPS or Fury Prot since I saw one using a DR OH and the other using a Mirah's) and to my surprise a *Hunter* gets it. I can't speak for Fury Prot (though I'd imagine they'd want it too) but supposedly the other Mirah's guy has priority on a BWL weapon.  Now if I was doing shitty and they didn't want me to join (doesn't seem to be the case) then I can understand - but they've extended an invite and I'm on the fence because it was just so salt inducing. The BB is effectively just a +9 Agi upgrade over an Assassination Blade for the Hunter.

I'm using Viskag/Mirah's so even though it would have been an OH upgrade it still would have been a good one for me.

fo5lli,DrSuckenstein,I'm having a hard time committing to a class and playing it all the way through. Help.,"So, I'm that guy who tends to constantly keep making new characters because I get bored so incredibly easy. I also have stupid dog syndrome - in that every-time I see someone do something shiny, I want to do it too. 

For Classic Wow, this is a bad thing to have since the time investment from 0 to 60 is so large. 

So I've tried most (not all) of the classes into the mid teens and something always happens that makes me justify starting something new. But there are also some static things that discourage me from playing certain classes or doing certain things. (like availability of 5 mans in that role, ease of leveling by myself, gear availability etc) 

I'm older, I can't play every day so I play what would be considered casual (5-10 hours a week maybe, and that time used is not efficiently.)

But now I'm at the point where my friends are running end game content and I'm still noodling around. It's starting to cause anxiety because I'm putting stress on myself to just go grind. (which in itself is only fun sometimes.) And every-time I want to try something else new I get the eye rolls ""Another character?"" questions. 

Currently, I'm playing a mage, I'm in the low 20's. I went with mage because of the appeal of AOE grinding to try and level quickly. It turns out AOE grinding is hard, has to be done in contested territories and your talent build to support it leaves you super vulnerable to getting killed and thus, slowing you down even further. I'm not enjoying it. 

There are things I enjoy about most classes but I'm having a REALLY hard time accepting their short comings or limitations.

Before I was spec'd Fury/Prot but now I have spec'd to regular DPS Fury. One of my main concerns with being a Fury DPS after transitioning from Fury/Prot is if I will be able to tank dungeons just as I have before. I'm afraid that If I try and get into a group as a tank but they see that I am spec'd to fury instead of Fury/Protection that I will be let go from most groups.

fo1f84,ColeSlaw80,A first time WoW players impression of PvP.,"I started playing classic on release had never played before, on a PvP server, it was what it was, lots of getting camped and un fun shit, but not overwhelmingly terrible. 

In any case - I was never interested in PvP, just doing well in PVE scenarios, so I put a lot of effort into understanding how to effectively play a warrior and how to continue improving, and getting my best possible gear etc. 

I do very well in raids, and I’ll attribute that to actually putting in the effort to understand mechanics and how to accurately do them. 

But the important stuff now, grinded to rank 10 for the shoulders and R8 legs, and I can honestly say, I have never enjoyed anything in any video game less than PvP in WoW.

At the time it was mainly AV, almost exclusively, with a few WSG games thrown in. I’m not sure if I would have a different view from Horde side, but I seriously doubt it. As a first time player, it probably has to do with the fact that overall I’m not that good at it, and I objectively am not as geared for or focused on PvP. But honestly, every aspect of it is just unfun, unrewarding, and the ranking system is absolutely ridiculous. I get it’s 15 years old, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s objectively terrible. 

I see so many posts just complaining this way and that way about PvP, and my only thought is why don’t you just stop? It genuinely seems like everybody has such a horrible experience, and I understand why and absolutely relate.",17,1585037573,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fo1f84/a_first_time_wow_players_impression_of_pvp/,classicwow,1

I'm since tired of Alliance and really feel like I've gotten my fill, my server is very imbalanced and I am ready for something entirely new.

I've decided on a balanced server and am going to play Horde. I decided against rolling another Warrior tank as I've already done the two slowest levelers and I doubt getting gear and raid spots as a Prot Warrior is easy at this point in the game.

So I'm torn between a Rogue or a Hunter. My question is, what class would be easier to get raid spots and gear at this point, especially with ZG coming out?

My thoughts;

Rogue - Stealth, Take advantage of Windfury and Solo exploration/BRD runs.

Hunter - Pet, Epic quest at 60, Solo farming DM/Mara.

I really am concerned about coming in late to the game on Horde side and getting gear/groups.",30,1585028447,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fnztbt/rerolling_new_faction_on_a_fresh_server_cant/,classicwow,1

fntz4k,ZombieTheRogue,I get a strong nostalgia for release week of classic. I've never experienced something so amazing.,"Classic has been out for 7 months now, and it's pretty much completely changed. Most servers i would assume are like mine and people pay level 60s for dungeon runs. Everyone has cleared raids multiple times and mostly everyone pvp's or at least they do in my server. 

Sure, you can still find dungeon groups and there are definitely people levelling and having fun in this great MMO. It's not the same as it was on release though and even writing this I get a huge surge of nostalgia. 

It was truly the best experience I've had in gaming and I mean that. Maybe you can relate if you didn't play vanilla back in 2004-6 but for me experiencing this legendary MMO in its original form on a fresh server with so much hype behind it really exceeded my expectations. Everyone was so positive and optimistic about something in their lives for once. Everyone you met was questing and grouping and doing dungeons for fun, and levelling up and making friends along the way. 

I can gladly say that as an almost 30 year old man i booked that week of and most days played about 18 hours. Didn't even crack lvl 40 by the end of the week. I was simply enjoying the game by doing hard quests solo (i tried doing orange elite quests by myself and took hours to complete sometimes), i would do dungeons with random people and didn't even look at my level. For the first time i experienced a game that was great from level 1 to Ragnaros himself. 

I will forever cherish those times and I mean that. Games to me have always been ""that was alright, on to the next"" type of deal. Classic really impressed me with how engaging it could be with, on the surface, little content. 

That feeling is gone now, at least for me. There isn't that fresh feel to the servers anymore. There isn't that infinite realm of possibilities sensation that i experienced during levelling.

fnt1vm,Balanceresto,Did Blizzard ever explain hybrid gearing?,"It's common knowledge that hybrids didn't live up to what Blizzard originally intended (Kevin Jordan has said in an interview that they had planned on having properly-specced hybrids do 90% as well as pure classes in each role) and that gearing for hybrids is really weird (given that they originally planned on shamans doing some ranged dps and paladins doing some melee dps between healing, T1 is badly itemized for both).

The thing is, that by AQ the weaknesses of hybrids in DPS roles was well-established, and in top guilds we were (almost) all relegated to healing roles in PvE (I mained a shaman in vanilla and was healing on bosses while ""dpsing"" on trash through BWL as 0/30/21).  In addition, though some specs were seriously overhyped (due to how poorly geared and downright bad nearly everyone was in PvP, enhancement shamans were considered overpowered gods, leading to the WF AP nerf that I'm still salty about well over a decade hence...) I think that around this time Blizz also had a much better idea about how PvP gear should look like.

I've listened to all the Kevin Jordan interviews and asked around on class discords, but I still don't understand the following:

1. Did they ever explain why they kept the nerf on caster 1H weapon DPS (which was done I believe to prevent rogues from taking caster daggers) when this put shamans and paladins at a pretty big disadvantage, because our ""wanding"" is melee?  It just makes no sense that a 1H caster mace from AQ has a lower top end than some 55 blue with melee stats.  I kinda understand the intent behind the nerf, but they must have been aware of what this did to elemental shamans and holy paladins and apparently thought it was balanced.

2. What's with all the retribution-intended +healing plate, stuff like [these boots](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=21704) from AQ?  Almost all of the weird hybrid plate gear that looks like this has very nice elemental shaman counterparts.  Did Blizz really think as deep into the game as AQ that paladins were playing a hybrid role in raids, and even then, why not +damage/healing instead?  All this +agi/+str/+healing plate is basically useless if you have access to pure AP ret/T2-type gear in PvP (depending on the role you play in group PvP) and some +healing cloth in PvE.

3. Similar to the above, there's some decent enhancement gear in later patches, but there's also a lot of pure-elemental gear that wastes stats on STR.  Stuff like these [gauntlets](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21487/slimy-scaled-gauntlets) that have a token amount of STR (so enhance shamans don't want it) but as elemental shaman, why do I want any extra AP *when you've nerfed my caster weapon* into being so weak, and nerfed my windfury so I have to spec deep enhance to make good use of it without lots of AP gear anyway?

4.  This is more of an observation than a question, but it's kinda insane that there's a lot more good caster mail than caster leather.  The balance tree is already a shitshow (and point-for-point inferior in almost every way to the shaman elemental tree), but druids benefit far from from armor than shamans do, so it was just a weird omission to put so little caster leather into the game.  Kevin Jordan mentioned that they were balancing around classes getting invited to raids rather than specs, and given the absolutely dire state of druids in the first few patches and the difficulty in many druid 60s in finding groups, maybe they wanted to overcorrect and make sure all druids in raids (99% of whom were resto) had good access to +healing gear?

My guess (aside from the 1H caster weapon nerf which seems really an intentional nerf to ele shamans and holy paladins) that the above were simply mistakes made in their abortive attempts to make hybrids ""a thing"" in vanilla, and stuff like trying to promote ret paladins to stack +healing (or holy paladins to stack +agi/+str) and to have elemental shamans care about melee damage just didn't work out in the way they intended.",172,1585001202,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fnt1vm/did_blizzard_ever_explain_hybrid_gearing/,classicwow,1

fnmq3h,butthead9181,Need an opinion," Didn't want to make a post on it's own for this, but seemed to long to post in daily questions. However, I need an opinion on this as it's been going on for weeks now.

I play on a medium server, Horde out weighs. Hard to find things sometimes, so little things like Savory deviates don't flood the market and are a good money maker.

A few weeks ago I was fishing, and started fishing the same pool as this gnome mage. At the time, I wasn't aware it was a dick move. I have let alliance and horde share pools with me and it's never bothered me. He got upset, I didn't really understand why as I don't have an issue with it? The pools re-spawn so quick and are every where close by.

To get back at me, he's been undercutting the value of the fish. Me and some other guy were selling them 14-15g a stack. This dude starts selling them for 10, and a lot of these stacks. So no anyone else putting these stacks up now has to put them up for lower in order to move them. I could probably buy his out, and re-post them but..I don't want to risk it, as this dude has been level 48 for well over a month and hasn't left the pools.

I messaged him saying, ""Hey man, you're not only hurting your own profits. You're hurting everyone else doing this."" I also wasn't aware how often he logged so I sent him mail with this message too.

""You started this by stealing from my pool.""

I just don't get it? Is costing your self 4-5 gold a stack of fish worth the probably what 70 silver at max I fished from his pool? Fine whatever, I just posted mine lower and sold them.

Today weeks later, I check my postings and this dude has begun to drastically undercut the value again. So I message him again. ""We still doing this? Can't we just come to some compromise?"" ""Nope. I'm reporting you.""

fnlrkd,zultan_miller,Holy Pally healing on Vael,"Hi folks - I'm a relatively well-geared hpally but I am doing a shit job of healing on Vael.  My guild puts a priest in most groups for prayer of healing and has all of the pallies heal the MT.  I'm usually doing either flash of light or holy light on the tank, but my parses are real bad (~20).  Which is a huge outlier from my performance elsewhere.

How are other hpallies healing this fight?  I tried adding more FR gear at the expense of +healing gear, but I'm still getting interrupted while casting from the nova even with 130-150 FR. 
 I thought about trying to put up Concentration Aura (I have a couple of points in the talent), but I think the DPS in my group really needs FR aura.  

Any tips from other pallies on how to be more effective? How do other pallies approach this fight?  Are the pallies that are parsing higher just assigned to raid heal?  Out MT isn't dying until he gets REALLY low health from adrenaline, so I think our system works.

I cannot see why they did not do this already, seeing as a server like Firemaw has been ""FULL"" for a while now. As can be seen on the front page of this subreddit, this is not an issue unique to Firemaw, but has been reported to be a thing on other EU realms and on realms like [Indencius,](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fn9opu/blizzards_unrestricted_transfers_is_destroying_my/) although it seems to be the worst on Firemaw. 

Yesterday, Firemaw had queues from early afternoon until late evening, with 3000+ players in queue. Today, the queue has already started and people are staying logged in by idling in cities like you can see on the picture below, which I just took. Every few minutes, they hit the spacebar or move their character to stay online. This only worsens the queue for everyone, and is clearly also a player issue, but it is the result of Blizzard not doing anything about the long queues, like stopping paid transfers to ALREADY FULL REALMS LIKE FIREMAW.

The formula:  1-p^n=chance you get SVG

p is the chance you dont get SGC (99%) and n is the amount of runs you need to do.

So for 80% chance of getting SGC, you need 1-0.99^n = 0.8
This solves for n = 160.

If you want to be 99% sure, n becomes 458.

fnk3ik,psy_g,Question about the state of the game,"I really enjoyed the launch of the game through to around P2. I was really excited for the release of BGs but was let down quite soon after that, I unsubbed around christmas. I am now wondering how is the state of the game because I am contemplating on subbing again since I, as many others, have now pretty much more spare time at home. The release of AB is what I've looked forward the most, also thought about leveling a new alt. I played Horde on Gehennas (EU) for reference.  


The main things I'm wondering about are (comparing to how things were around Christmas):

1. Is AB playing out the same way that AV and WSG did, Horde faces pretty much every game Alliance premades? How are the queue times for Horde in AB?  
2. Is AV and WSG when they are on the weekends like they were back around Christmas, AV being just about rushing the objective and WSGs mostly Alliance premades for Horde?  
3. How is the ""botting problem"", in leveling zones, AV and lvl 60s?  
4. Are lower level dungeons still mostly being carried by higher levels, hard to get a ""normal"" group to do them with?  
5. Are 60s 5-mans still an AOE party?  
6. Are there many ppl still leveling alts, easy to find ppl to offer you help or do group quests with?  
7. How is the world PvP doing?  
(8. Are there more people dueling outside Org, this is something I really miss from Vanilla! :D)  


NOTE: These are only the things I did not PERSONALLY enjoy, I am not looking for a debate about if these things are good or bad. I strongly think that people should get to play the game however they want. :)

fnk2yu,pohling2,AB Strategy Rant,"Hi guy, i'm loving playing AB these days but there is some dogma that pugs and most pre-mades preach which is very annoying because in many cases the strategy is not correct. 

The 2 main conventional strats that I would like to contest are:
1) Never fight on the road
2) Always fight on the flag

In MANY cases it is the correct play to do precisely the opposite. This is entirely dependent on your class and the opponents as well  as the quantity of players. 
For example, I play druid and this is the class that probably does the most help fighting on the road. If our team has 3 bases and I can stealth between an enemy base and the home base they are grouping up to attack, I can pop out to root someone and peel their initial charge. Many times this can also draw 2-3 more players towards me and I distract them more with travel form. Unlike druids, mages, and hunters classes like wars and pallys almost never benefit fighting on the road unless for critical distraction. 
Fighting on the flag can also be very risky when trying to defend depending on the # of attackers and classes. If 1v1 vs a rogue fighting on the flag is just begging for you to get blind-&gt;capped. If far enough from the flag blind is not in range to have time to cap afterwards. Drawing attackers (especially melee) away from the flag is very effective but it depends on the potential threat of being CC too far away and another attacker capping. It also greatly varies on your classes toolkit to interrupt the flag (as druid I usually want to draw them away from flag cause moonfire). 

Let please stop blindly citing strategy heuristics while we call players scrubs for fighting on the road or not being on top of flag and look at the situations a little more critically.

i wanted to create an sheet where i can put in the head some information (for e.g. like ""70 iron ore"", next field ""70 solid stone"", next field ""70 mithril ore"" and ""xy mageweave cloth"") and that calculates for me:

&amp;#x200B;

create 8x unstable trigger

and i can build like 8 goblin sapper charges

so i can see how much stuff i had to make. and which stops me from making like 10 unstable trigger and only can build like 5 sapper cuz of too less solid stones (or powder out of it).

have anyone a idea how that can be programmed in excel or if there is something like that already existent?

fnftz9,Nite92,Duo Leveling: Pala Rogue,"Hey guys,

I'll be duo leveling with a friend of mine. I've chosen to level a paladin and he'll be going rogue. I've looked through the talent tree of both classes, but tbh, without ever having played a paladin, it is quite tough to decide what is going to work and what is not. I'm pretty confident, that I should try to keep aggro on things due to armor/backstab. The question is, how do I balance defense/support vs. damage. Should I get BoK/70% cast throw back immunity at first, or just go down the ret road? 

From what I have found so far, Ret damage seems to be not even close to a rogues damage, that is why I think I'd be better of supporting/tanking and keep us going rather than going for damage myself. What is your take on it?

fncico,Jay_Combat,[Kirtonos][Horde] &lt;The Stormcrows&gt; Are on the hunt for players for our 2nd raid team!," The Stormcrows are actively looking for new raiders for the formation of our Group 2 raid team. In need of every class/role.    
We're a very active and established guild, clearing BWL on opening week with weekly Sunday clears. 10/10 MC 8/8 BWL +Ony Weekly.  
 With our  community continuing to grow it's time that we expand our rosters and bring out a 2nd raid team to help complete our mission.     


The Stormcrows is a very family oriented group, every member we have is committed to one another in a very ""no one left behind"" atmosphere. Built on assisting others has given us outstanding team morale and a fun raid discord nights. When you're in here, you're family, and you'll be treated as such.  
   
 We use a formula of DKP + a short list of Loot Council items, with formal documentation to help answer any questions that you may have about how we handle things regarding raids and events.    


Raid times for Group 2 are still being decided on and more information will be coming forward in the next few days but currently starting at 10:00pm server time Monday nights. (These times are subject to change as more people join and discuss times)   
 The initial raids will be MC full clear to establish the groups and smoothing out assignments and quickly moving into BWL after a few clears.    


 So if you're looking for a new place to hang out with a great group of people, come give us a try.   
We do run logs every raid for those big parsers interested!

fn9opu,AssBlastedLOL,Blizzard's unrestricted transfers is destroying my guild on Incendius.,"Incendius has always been full.  As in beyond capacity full.  Extreme competition for resources full.  For a long time it had a stable group of dedicated guilds, and competition has been strong for everything.  World bosses, herbs, ore, you name it.  World PVP was a colossal clusterfuck, with thousands of people roaming and ganking 24/7.

To summarize: this server has always been over capacity.

Then came the paid server transfers.  For whatever unconscionable reason, Blizzard not only has allowed transfers to full servers, they continue to allow it to this day.  Each week has seen an influx of guilds from all over. Skeram, Stalagg, now Faerlina, tons of guilds have fled their terrible servers and come here.

Incendius now is beyond unplayable.  Tuesday gets 2-3 hour queues during raid time.  My Tuesday guild was tired of having people miss and dealing with raids short 5-10 people, so we moved to Sunday.  Now, Sunday is getting a queue (30 minutes right now) at raid time.

Resources are basically nonexistent.  Everything is completely farmed 100% of the time, and everything is inflated beyond belief (Black Lotus are 160g, major mana potions are 3.5g).  Most of the people in my guild have lost the motivation to even log in, nonetheless farm or fight with the hordes of people trading on the markets.

What's worse, the culture of Incendius has shifted dramatically.  WoW has always attracted ""special"" types of people, but Incendius before was rather chill relatively speaking.  Now I have to constantly mute people in world chat because other servers brought ""special"" types of people who have shifted the culture.

Now my guild's thinking of simply disbanding our second raid group.  We're just fucking tired of it.  Most of us agreed we would have quit long ago due to the terrible PVP mismanagement and now Blizzard's terrible server management.  The only thing keeping us together is the fact we like each other generally as a guild, but the threads are loosening and we're tired of this shit.

Blizzard, you fucked up in classic alot, and I really don't want to give you any more money.

Sincerely,

One day one Incendius player who is pissed the fuck off.",195,1584920084,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fn9opu/blizzards_unrestricted_transfers_is_destroying_my/,classicwow,1

fn81yg,Juus,Blizzard should really consider doing something extraordinary about all this extra Corvid-19 traffic on our realms.,"Quarantines and social distancing means people are staying at home, and World of Warcraft happen to be an excellent pastime at home. 

It seems pretty obvious that there is a new influx of returning players which are causing some rather big queues now, my guildmate just reported a position 3200 in queue on Firemaw at a time where we usually don't even have a queue, and the last week or so we've had problems on raidnights with impotant raid members stuck in the queue.

I suggest that Blizzard spend some of that returning money to do something in the line of:

1. Temporarily up the realm player capacity. I'm sure the extra subscribers are more than enough to upgrade whatever cloud service the servers are hosted on. 

2. Temporarily bring back layers. 

3. Open up free transfers again, which i personally don't like since i really enjoy the community on my realm.

We are all making sacrifices in some way or another in these times, both people and companies alike. Blizzard seem to be one of few companies who are lucky enough to be able to make money on this crisis, so it would really look good on Blizzard if they gave their customers a little back by spending some of that extra money on their servers capacity.",10,1584914083,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fn81yg/blizzard_should_really_consider_doing_something/,classicwow,1

In classic, I want to stick to healing but tried out a class I have zero experience with: Priest. I been leveling this priest all week and at LV18 I just entered my first battleground. Man...it was miserable. I got completely picked apart anytime I was out in the open. And trying to heal teammates was not easy either with them constantly moving and me having to stand still to heal them. With Mistweaver, I'm just used to being extremely mobile.

There has been a massive influx of new players recently. Naturally there are some positives, recently we picked up 2-3 players who had transferred from another server. These are high skill players and it's good to get them. But unfortunately the downsides are outweighing the upsides. There is a 5 hour queue tonight. On Wednesday there will be a 3 hour queue.   
This is being compounded severely by the Covid-19 outbreak with so many people either off school, working from home or not working. So lots of people are playing WoW. 

I hope that people realise that Firemaw is a good server, yes, but it's a full server - a VERY full server, and it is not somewhere you should transfer or make a new character at this current time.

fmzh5s,dytster-,Should I let other people dictate how much honor I can get?,"I just posted this a few minutes ago, but it got removed so I'm trying again but with some (perhaps/hopefully) better words.

So I'm currently rank 6 and I've decided to go for rank 8 as some of the gear will be useful in PvE scenarios. I am playing my heart out atm because I just wanna get it done asap, and I feel fairly confident that I can do it in two weeks. But because I'm doing good on honor this week I've started getting whispers by the ""PvP leaders"" on my server who dictates what brackets people should be in. People telling me I should be capped already, and telling me I might break brackets etc. One guy even said he didn't want to play with me because apparently i am ruining it for other people. I am not even close to the guys pushing for rank 14 in terms of honor, but I am hovering somewhere around mid bracket 11. The guy who did most of the complaining so far has only obtained an amount equal to 42% of the honor I am currently at, and honestly I don't see how that can be my problem.

I've played maybe 5-10% of my time in premades, and the rest of the time with 1-2 friends or solo. But now people are complaining and want to control me. So, should I really have to postpone my own goal just because ""you're only rank 6"" or what? 

The honor game is fair for everyone, and I don't like someone dictating how I should get to play it and how long it should take for me to reach my goal. If they want more RP than me then they should just play more than me. At least that's my thoughts about it.

Also, I haven't ""signed up"" for anything in terms of staying behind certain people on honor, staying in a certain bracket, or anything of that kind. I am just a guy who gets in to a battle ground to get as much honor as possible to reach my goal as fast as possible.

fmz6w1,adamalvarez1996,Raid night cancelled,"So was it just Mankrik-US last night or did other servers experience server lag so bad that the game became unplayable? I know there was confirmed DDOS attacks all throughout the day and have been all week (seriously hope the people doing that choke and die), but this wasn't confirmed by Blizzard CS in a tweet. The game was also working just fine til around 10pm est.

Around 10:00pm last night during our guilds only scheduled BWL run, we downed Vael and as we were preparing to fight the trash before supression room, we got so bogged down with lag that when our guild leader asked everyone to jump to test how bad it was, it took 20+ seconds before the server responded and we all jumped in place.

Was this the result of a DDOS? The problem was, as soon as we called it around 10:30, and went back to cities (me in UC, a bunch of others went to Org), it was perfectly fine? As in there was no lag, so was this targeting BWL somehow specifically? Can someone DDOS one person in our group and cause this all to happen? We have known streamers but I don't think any of them are that we well known and there's 39 other people that you'd think wouldn't be affected?

 I don't understand what's going on but how disappointing it is to look forward to this all week only to have it ripped from under our guild as of a result from something out of any of our control. We're all stuck at home during these trying times and just want an escape.",5,1584880142,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fmz6w1/raid_night_cancelled/,classicwow,1

fmtmwj,DatBear978,Spellbatching and #Nochanges,"So as Spellbatching has been put on the spotlight for ruining PvP and healing, a lot of people have decided that this is the fault of ""those #nochanges fuckheads"", now as an avid #nochanges spammer myself I really think there should be some clarification.


When people say they want ""#Nochanges"", they don't mean they want 2004 vanilla in 2019-2020, what they actually meant was that they wanted classic to feel like a blizz-like private server(a la Nostralrius aka the entire damn reason we have classic in the first place.) . The entire community that pushed hard for this game were avid and experienced pserver players, those who went through Kronos, Feenix, Nost,etc. The term #Nochanges was designed to keep the game from feeling like a good private server, to a shitty funserver, you can see this in the thousands of comments lashing out against the idea of LFG, in game store, etc. all things that people in the private server community had to deal with and despised. The term also displayed the inherent distrust of blizzard which is fair considering they haven't had a good piece of news in 5 years sans the release of this game, you can also look back and see this in the thousands of ""if blizz fucks this up, we go back to pservers"" posts. 

This idea that the #Nochanges crowd are the reason behind the implementation and keeping of spellbatching and leeway(BOTH MECHANICS THAT WERE DETESTED SINCE BETA), is misguided, only a select few of asmongold marks actually parroted this as a good idea (see how all the praise is on official blizzard forums).",5,1584849881,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fmtmwj/spellbatching_and_nochanges/,classicwow,1

fmrhia,erydan,"I actually don't mind tanks charging for tanking services or reserving items, BUT...","Please be at least average.

Listen, i get it. I play a healer, i've been hired by warriors to duo arena for SGC. I get all the loot that drops. But i'm good at what i'm doing. I'm holy spec, in healing gear. Deaths are practically non-existant, unless it's some sort of act of god.

The amount of shit tanks charging groups while they're wearing shit gear that's not made for tanking is astounding. My recent experiences include a holy paladin in regular, non-tanking blues thinking he could tank live strat, but couldn't hold any threat and had his hp drop from 100 to 10% on each pull. Or this warrior reserving all the greens and non-need blues in LBRS... despite never having done LBRS before and had to be coached throughout the whole dungeon, making a ~1h run take 3.

Like i said, i get it. Tanks are in high demand, it allows you to get away with charging groups and reserve certain items. But if you're going to provide a service in exchange of a payment, at least be fucking decent at what you're doing.

You don't need a TF or an engi disk, but if you're new to tanking, or just bad at it, at least have the decency to not charge the group and just roll on items like everybody else.

fmp04l,skeepbapblap,"PSA Priests and Druids: prepare for the ""Edge of Madness"" trinkets coming in p4.","The Edge of Madness trinkets [""Hazarrah's Charm of Healing""](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19958/hazzarahs-charm-of-healing) and [""Wushoolay's Charm of Nature""](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19955/wushoolays-charm-of-nature)  are fast approaching with the release of ZG.   IMO these are the best healer items in the entire game, and yet they somehow go overlooked by way too many people. The trinket's on-use effect reduces the cast time of your greater heals to 1.5s(and druid's max rank HTs to 1.8s i believe) for 15 seconds with a 3 minute cooldown. It allows you put out an incredible amount of healing in a very short amount of time. It is the perfect ""oh shit"" button that can turn near-certain wipes into minor speedbumps. It's particularly good in AQ40 with its large amounts of unpredictable raidwide damage, and it has insanely good synergy with the priests' 8/8 t2 set bonus as well as the the ""Scarab Brooch"" trinket obtained from Viscidus in AQ40. Every serious raiding guild should be aiming to get this item on every single one of their Priests and Druids ASAP.  If you have enough of these trinkets in your raid,  you will completely trivialize some trash and boss encounters that are very challenging to heal otherwise(particularly Huhuran and Viscidus in AQ40,  and Gluth in Naxxramas).

As for how to get it: There is an optional encounter inside zul'gurub called 'Edge of Madness"" in which there are 4 different bosses that can be summoned, and the specific boss rotates on a 2 week timer. You will need to kill all 4 bosses and loot their unique items to make your trinket, which means that it will take just over 6 weeks from the launch of p4 to make the trinket. To summon these bosses, you must douse a brazier near the event with a ""gurubashi mojo madness"" potion. These potions are quite expensive as they require black lotus to make. 1 black lotus will make 3 potions, and you need 4 potions for the 4 boss encounters, so you will need 2 black lotus to make a trinket yourself. The massive mojos are obtained from bosses within ZG, so your guild's leadership should be on top of properly allocating those to a guild alchemist who has some blood of heroes(soulbound) farmed. The powerful mojo will definitely spike in value around the time p4 launches so id suggest getting that stocked ASAP.

After summoning and killing the EOM boss, he will drop 1-2 of his unique items. You will need to collect these 4 items, one from each boss, and combine them with your class's specific voodoo doll to make the trinket. It's important that you keep track of the boss rotation windows, because if you miss one of the bosses it means you will have wait an additional 6 weeks for the boss to rotate back into the instance before you can get the trinket.

Don't sleep on this thing. I'm not exaggerating when I called it the best healer item in the game. Once you learn how to leverage the timing of this trinket around the spike damage that occurs in the encounters, and adjust your mana consumption and consumes accordingly, it becomes an extremely effective and satisfying style of healing, and it can also be devastating in PVP.  I cant count the amount of times I have kept up friendly rogues and clothies while they were being beaten on by multiple warriors using this trinket.  It should be the top priority of every Priest and Druid healer to get this thing.  As someone who has played a priest multiple times through on pservers, I have come to think of vanilla wow in two distinct phases: pre-EOM trinket and post-EOM trinket. It is that significant.",132,1584831842,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fmp04l/psa_priests_and_druids_prepare_for_the_edge_of/,classicwow,1

fmobe6,Gosu_Horaz,Question about Hit/Crit/Miss (for spells),"So, I've yet to find a definitive answer to this: does the game roll once or twice to determine if you hit/crit/miss?

To make this more clear. There are two different ways people claim this works:

* The game rolls for hit or miss. Then, if it is a hit, the game rolls again for crit or hit.

* The game rolls once for miss/hit/crit.

The first one would mean that spell hit is a lot more important for dps than spell crit while the second makes them pretty much exactly equal (disregarding crit procs)

Is this known information and if yes does proof exist?

fmi8vt,Aramageshu,Solo'd Pusillin but no loot,"I've been kinda bored in quarantine, and I never got the recipe from Pusillin in DM East. Since I've been doing solo jump runs as a warlock, I decided to try and solo Pusillin for the challenge to get the recipe.

Several deaths later, I finally get set up with an enslaved Satyr Betrayer and just Pusillin with no imp buddies. The tactic I read said to attack Pusillin with the Betrayer and to heal your demon with Health Funnel. I executed this with no issues, but when Pusillin died he was not lootable. My demon also seemed confused since he was stuck in an animation of retracting his bow.

I'm trying to figure out why Pusillin wasn't lootable. Is it because I never attacked him? Usually DBM says ""boss xx engaged"" but I never received that. Not sure if this was a mechanical issue that I didn't recognize or a bug that prohibits attempting this again.

I'm the GM of a pretty successful raiding guild but was wondering how some the other guild masters of classic are running/organizing their guilds.

* What different officer positions do you have?
* What are some of the tasks you just would never feel comfortable allowing someone to do?

Also I have a guildy who develops addons and asked me what I would find useful in a guild management type of addon and I feel like this is one area where addons (besides GRM) just aren't really there yet, so bonus question:

I am on a normal PvP server with pretty good population and A/H ratio. 

Overall im very happy with my server, but im kind of limited with time I could sink into wow.  
Right now im a very good geared 60 rogue and I manage my time okay, 2 raids a week out of the 4 evenings I can play, but the other 2 evenings I got pretty much nothing to do and I dont want to level an alt to be honest.

I am thinking of transferring over to Zandalar Tribe as an alliance, my question is, if I want to get some more out of the game, how good is it? Is there any RP really or is it just a normal PvP server with 1/10 of the people trying to RP?  
I tried making a lvl 1 and snooping around in Stormwind, but I can't really get an accurate representation of what it really is because most people think im a bank alt and walk right past me.

fmdg8w,oldsaxman,Classic is so much better than Retail,"So, in a moment of boredom I loaded up my old Retail account and then logged onto one of the realms and decided to try out my very old level 6 Dwarf hunter. It took me a few tried to understand how much they have automated things. Finally got playing. Played about 4 hours. Went up ELEVEN levels in 4 hours! Granted, had lots of rest experience, but 11 levels?? Everything is automated, quests all pointed out, etc. Oh, and I died ONCE... JUST ONCE. What is up with the shared kills and looting? I was confused at one thing or another most of the time. Nice graphics, though. 

So, logged back over to Classic. Loaded my NE rogue. Started playing... Troggs killed me 4 times trying to do one quest in about an hour or so. Died another 4 times killing elites with a group... ganked by a horde patrol another time. I think I died 9 or 10 times. Levels from 17 to 19 in abou4 four hours, but had rest exp and several quests to turn in from prior play. So, there is a pretty close comparison. 

What do I like? Classic, with all its issues and difficulties it is more interactive, more visceral and definitely more challenging.",12,1584789209,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fmdg8w/classic_is_so_much_better_than_retail/,classicwow,1

Classic wow has been a blast and we can all agree on that, but i noticed that people are crying about a lot of stuff.Most of the complains i saw were about horde racials and how good they were in pvp. Well i didnt care because i mosly play pve but recently i started to pvp. I got all tree factions to exalted after a lot of grinding- winning and losing . So why am i writting this post? Well to complain ofc xD. YES....horde racial are good , but lets talk about paladins a bit .
Why is no one addressing this?  They are super broken in pvp its not even fun. Bubble, all kind of dispells, Blessing of Protection, SUPER GOOD HEALS. 
""Yeah but you have windfury "" - really? A totem with 5 hp that can be killed by a rat . Really? ? ? 
Anyways i know im crying right now but the facts speak from themselves. Almost every good premade gets 2 paladins, and lets not talk about AB premades because i have seen 7 paladins there.

fmakz3,kicsitheone,"Classic WoW sucks, change my mind!","Since the pandemic my friend convinced me to pay for the subscription and give wow classic a go, now I regret ever paying for the subscription again. This is going to be super controversial but I do not really care, this is my opinion about classic in a nutshell.

Well first of all I have years of being a wow player and I would say pretty hardcore at that. I started in late BC and played all through WOTLK clearing all the content fully that the expansion provided then later on quit around early cataclysm. I did however play during legion but have not played the previous/further expansions. During wotlk i would say i was pretty hard-core as i had nothing better to do during high-school. I cleared everything on HC difficulty and I was an achievement whore with over 8k points so i think i know what I am talking about.

**Classes**

* **Pros**: There are restrictions on classes, I guess.  can’t really write anything here tbh. maybe how there are class determining stuff like paladin seals, warrior stances and shaman totems. Don’t get me wrong, I liked the talent system where you could experiment with stuff and I like the progression feeling what learning new skills from the trainer provide.

* **Cons**:
The classes are unbalanced, nothing is optimized properly there are entire talent trees that are straight up useless and count as memes (don’t even try to argue how any tank other than warrior is good or feral dps for instance). I know that there are tons of guild that are not min-maxing (Praise the only dwarf guild) and there are more options to experiment but certain classes are just locked to certain roles and there is nothing you can do about it. The rotations are boring as you most likely will spam 1 key for the whole fight as a dps.



**Instances/Raiding**

* **Pros**:
There is something cool about 40 people working together to clear an instance. The guild runs are fun and you do have to interact with other people just to clear a 5man dungeon.

* **Cons**:
Instances are huge, it takes a long time just to run through it after you cleared the instance since they were not designed for farming and devs thought it would be a one-time experience. I literally feel bored just about the thought of going through maraudon one more time. The tactics for the bosses are easy and not that challenging what proves it more than apes just cleared it in greens and with characters not even being lvl60. You need a lot of time and resources to prepare for a raid because of the consumables you have to collect for it. 

**Leveling/Questing**

* **Pros**:
It is nice to not do quests alone and in classic you are basically forced to do stuff in parties. Personally, this is the only Pro for me, but I am open for arguments.

* **Cons**:
Killing mobs is just tedious as hell. There is nothing “challenging” about killing a fucking wolf just because I oom after I casted frost bolt 3 times. There is nothing fun about dying just because I accidentally pulled 2 mobs and not just one. I hate how you have to sit down for minutes eating to complete a simple kill quest. There are not nearly enough quests to level up until 60 comfortably. A lot of them are just blatant kill this kill that, collect some stuff without any story or lore behind it. I understand that not all the quests should have essays written about them, but I like how later expansions became more and more story focused with long quest chains about the lore itself. 

**Community**

* **Pros**: 
As far as I was following the subreddit and YouTube videos the community is there, there are a lot of new guide/lore/meme videos being made each day and there is a lot of discussion about random stuff. If you want to ask for help in the game, it is most likely people are going to help out sometimes even going out of their way which is pretty cool. The cities are filled with people and it gives you this warm feeling whenever you visit a city. There are many guilds that are not focusing on min-maxing and are focusing on the community aspect, that is the only reason my friend still plays this game. 

* **Cons**:
I hate how the “real gamer” praise this garbage ass game as it was made by gods and there is nothing wrong with it. You can still see some people on twitch and YouTube who won’t stop praising the game. Most people I know who started playing simply quit because of sheer boredom or they only log on for raids. These people just can’t seem to take off their rose-tinted glasses and look away at all the unfun aspects of the game. Like a content creator in his YouTube video he straight up said “you just got to kill mobs one by one sitting in your underwear watching Netflix on your other monitor.” Yeah, I see how fun the game can be when you do not have to give a shit about it.

***Just straight up complaints***

for some it might be nitpicks, but I do not care this is my opinion.
 
**Downtime**

I really hate how everything takes ages. No, I am not talking about leveling, I am talking about simple stuff like professions, travelling, basically doing stuff. I already talked about how you have to sit down after every mob you kill, I hate how everything  that you do takes an unreasonably long time [20s for fishing… really?] such as gathering stuff or mounting up. I would also put in here the searching for a dungeon group, but I do not want to get into that because it divides the community. Personally, I do not mind the dungeon finder (not the raid finder) if I want to go and clear an instance I do not want to spend an hour just to establish a proper group so maybe I can fly to a zone which is minutes away just to disband the group after wiping once. Now here comes the rant about being a single dad having 5 kids on two jobs and I only have time to play 10minutes a day. Even if I have time and can play the whole day, I do not want to waste it on this. 

**Quality of life** 

I do not like how you have to use an addon just to see how much your stuff can be sold to a vendor for or to see a mobs hp, or how you have to stand up for casting a spell. Also, the fucking wait time when looting a mob or buying/selling items to a vendor. I liked the mount/pet tab and the achievements that was introduced with WOTLK. It made me want to play the game more and more and sorry, but I do like how my consumables can be stacked for a reasonable amount and does not fill up my bag space.

**Graphics** 

I get it, yeah this is an old game but yeah guess what it is 2020. As I was playing legion, I loved the new character models, I loved the new animations it did bring. I really wanted the option to change between new/old graphics but unfortunately that was not the case. I really despise looking at the old animations, spells without cool effects or some stuff without animation at all. The gear just looks terrible. I like the fact how there is no transmog and you can see the time and progress on some of the players put into it but most of the old gear looks like shit (this might be the most controversial sentence). 

***Possible “dumb arguments”***

&gt; **-“but your character is not powerful why would it have good looking items”**

well sorry I do like to look cool in game no matter how powerful I am. Just because 

&gt; **-“but it is all about experiencing the game not min-maxing”**

Yeah, I get it how for some of the people it might be a new and fun experience but I have played this game for years and the most fun I had was in endgame content not while leveling. I could not care less about “exploring” anymore. Yes I did explore it multiple times, questing wise I even had the Loremaster achievement I have had enough “experiencing”.


&gt; **-“but all classes and specs are viable”**

Sure buddy... https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/031/021/cover2.jpg

&gt; **-“but the game is still fun”**

I only said that I do not enjoy the game I never said you should not like it. You love playing? Good for you I seriously am happy for it. World of warcraft has to be my favorite game ever made period. I just do not play it. I still enjoy reading the subreddit and watching the videos about it.

fmaill,Matsmeizter,New realm for a dad gamer,"Hello hello.

I am currently playing on Firemaw EU and I like that server alot, most people Ive meet has been Nice and for me it seems like a good community. The thing is, I have a few kids, and for some reason they need to be fed and put to bed each night. And for some other reason, they dont want to. So bedtime routines can take from 10 minutes to 2 hours.

Which brings me to the problem with Firemaw. Its a ""massive"" queue there almost every night. I try to plan my queuing, but when bedtime varies so much, I am often disconnected when I am done or still 40 mins left of queue.

I've decided to jump the ship and pay a transfer to a less populated realm. And was wondering which one I should chose.

A little about myself:

-Horde
-Currently lvling a new Main, undead priest lvl 40.
-Want to find a guild that raids casually. 
-Raidstart around 2100 servertime. 
-I dont want to be on a dead realm. 
-I can handle some queues, but not 2500 every night. 
-I would say I am a decent player, not good, not bad. 
-I am from norwegistan, close to the northpole ish. 

What server needs a few more horde lvling on it?

fm5eb2,Hipqo87,[Possible BUG] Improved HOT overwrite," Hello people!

I come here today to share some importaint information with you and have a chat about it. Ive searched and couldnt find this specific topic before.  
Basically +healing scales wrong with improved HOT’s (healing over time) spells.  
Let me set up a scenario:

2 Druids, both with 3/3 Improved Rejuv talents, none with the t2 set bonus.  
Druid 1 has 600 +healing, Druid 2 has 700+ healing.  
Druid 1 casts rejuv on the tank, works like a charm. Druid 2 doesnt see  this and casts rejuv, it overwrites the previous one (as it should).  
Now druid 1 wants to cast his Rejuv again, he cant! Whay? It says a more powerfull spell is already active.  
The only difference here is the +healing. Talents are the same and none has the t2 set bonus.  
Our priests are experiencing it with Improved Renew aswell.

Is that how +healing is intended to work with HOT’s? I seem to remember the only thing not allowing you to overwrite HOT’s was improved talents or the set bonus.  
Am i remembering wrong? Are you experiencing this aswell in your raids?

TLDR:  
You cannot overwrite an improved HOT, if the caster of said HOT has more  +healing then you do. Even with the same talents and skill bonuses!",13,1584748034,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fm5eb2/possible_bug_improved_hot_overwrite/,classicwow,1

fm461x,thewhapsap,Newcomer Priest looking for advice to dungeon healing,"Hello community 

I am a newcomer to wow and after a recent failed dungeon run i am looking for advice on how to become a better healer.

I am playing a lvl 20 undead priest. After going rfc and wc a few times (maybe 10 dungeon runs together) i tried for sfk. I was pretty optimistic in my ability to heal, because during my runs through rfc and wc my group never wiped and maybe 2 or three times a group member had died. 

I find myself with 2 druids, a mage and a rogue in my group for sfk. It started out pretty easy. Everyone seemed to know their way about. The tank held aggro and at first I had no problems healing. We proceed through the courtyard and the dining hall without problems. Then, at the part with the wooden bridge over top we wiped. The tank had gathered a good many mobs and because I had been lagging a bit behind, I could not heal him fast enough. I died and then messed up by immediately clicking to accept the battle rezz the other druid had put on me. I died again. This outed me as the newcomer I am. After returning to the instance I could not find the rogue asap to rezz him. This made one of the druids so angry he left the group. Within moments the others left too, only mentioning that they could understand the druids motivs to leave. 

After we disbanded I asked one of the players for a short feedback. All I got was, that the tank had almost died every pull and that I should go find a guide to read about my class because I didn't know the basics.

A few words in my defense: I did read quite a bit into how to play a priest. I try to mind the 5 sec rule, so I don't keep all the players on full health all the time. I heal the tank with heal + renew after he gets down to maybe 2/3 or 1/2 of his life.  I then proceed to cast heal and cancel if necessary. If damage spreads to others, I top them of with renew or lesser heal. I only use pws when in dire straits (usually when a dps gets to much aggro).


So all in all i am a bit at a loss right now (and a bit depressed by this fiasco). Can you guys give me some tips on how to be a better healer in dungeons?",32,1584743487,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fm461x/newcomer_priest_looking_for_advice_to_dungeon/,classicwow,1

With ZG just around the corner, and no end in sight to the Corona Virus - I wonder if there is another chance for us to do our little gnomish part and see which servers can cure the disease quickest? I think it was widely assumed that Blizzard would not include the bug at launch of ZG (being able to take the corrupted blood out of the instance) but...what if they didn't?

Could be a neat event for the players and provide insight to the medical community, lacking a great way to test human behavior without intentionally getting humans sick, and see what comes of it?",4,1584724533,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/flyqq8/corrupted_blood_and_covid19/,classicwow,1

flwrlv,Oglethorppe,Learning from Classic: How should TBC be executed differently from Classic?,"I’m loving Classic, but it’s got faults; some of which are baked into the fifteen year old game, and some are as a result of Blizzard’s execution of the re-release. In the likelihood that TBC is released, should Blizzard follow the same exact blueprints they built Classic with? Or perhaps they should examine any missteps they made with Classic? Here are a few ideas of elements that could be executed differently, for example:

- Patch progression, talents/itemizations, nerfs/buffs, 2.0 vs 2.4.3
 
- Speed of content releases
 
- Layering at launch
 
- Faction Balance/Server Size

If you can think of any other ways that TBC should be implemented, either differently or similarly, add to the list!",82,1584717706,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/flwrlv/learning_from_classic_how_should_tbc_be_executed/,classicwow,1

Considering they are weapons, they can be swapped in combat.  I was looking at some logs for different guilds on my server and noticed most Mages are using the Frost Tome through out the entire raid! Wouldn't it be more beneficial to swap to the appropriate off hand depending on the magic invulnerability per trash mob/Chromaggus? Fire Tome does the most damage, and Arcane Tome gives you MP5. Swapping these around mid fight would certainly add more DPS than just rocking the Frost Tome the whole time., don't you think? For now they are the best off hands for Mages and Locks. Does anyone actively do this? If so are you using a macro or do you have them key bound?

**Guild Name: &lt; Here We Go Again &gt; NEWLY FORMING GUILD**  
**Server: Whitemane**  
**Faction: Horde**

**Raid Schedule:**  
Invites go out at 6 :30  
Monday: 7:00pm - 11:00pm Server time (PDT)  
Tuesday: 7:00pm - 11:00pm Server time (PDT)

&lt; Here We Go Again &gt; is actively recruiting solid DPS/Healers &amp; 1 Tank to fill out our one and only core raid team. Casual 2 night raiding guild. If you’re looking for something a bit more refined, or perhaps tired of being an all-star in a second raid group, please consider joining!

Our goal is to progress through the content at a good pace while not being too serious and still having fun. We understand that you have a life outside of the game and don’t expect you to spend every second of free time in game. We do expect you to know the fights and have a good attitude.

We also will have smaller groups of PvP focused players who engage in World and Battleground PvP on a regular basis. We will be creating premades regularly once we have enough.

We are looking to recruit age 21+ players looking for a new start with the interest in getting in on the ground floor of something new. We aren’t looking for those who only show up for events or dungeons. We want to form a tight knit group of people who not only enjoy slaying dragons together but can enjoy hanging out during the week in discord.

We are open to new or old players of any experience level if they are willing to put in the time to learn.

**Who We Aren’t:**  
Speedrunners who clear MC/BWL in 30 mins.  
Stat padders (While stat-logs are important, they do not define us as a guild)  
Looters who only raid to loot (we enjoy our community!)

**EXPECTATIONS**  
All members should kick back &amp; enjoy the ride. A good attitude &amp; respect is very important to us. We want players who are enjoyable to be around. We will be looking to continue a thriving community of positive and mature players

**Requirements:**  
Raid first mentality  
Discord during raids  
Threat Classic / DBM / RCLootCouncil Classic

**Recruiting:**  
Druid – Open  
Hunter - Open  
Mage - Open  
Priest - Open  
Rogue - Open  
Shaman - Open  
Warlock - Open  
Warrior - Open

**Casual / non-raiding members are always welcome!**

We expect all raiders to have regular attendance and reasonable preparation. This includes any required consumables and knowledge of the fights prior to raid.

**Progression:**  
MC - 10/10  
Onyxia - 1/1  
BWL - 0/8

**Loot system :** We feel if you show up and put in time, you deserve an equal shot at loot you want.  
At the moment while we pug /random 100 on loot.

Future DKP system or a RC loot council with Class leads &amp; officers voting on gear  
This decision has not been made yet since we are a newly forming guild. Curious and want more info? DM me!

flt35l,Ansilo,The zandalar Tribe : Troll only guild EU Come join us," 

Hello everyone , My name is Roby and thank to reddituser : [u/Kalarrian](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kalarrian/) . I got this idea of starting a Troll only guild on the EU sever Zandalar Tribe(RP PVP)

The goal is to Raid with a full group of trolls and make it a challenge to overcome every fight this way.We are not hardcore raiders or anything like that. this is for fun and to keep us disctracted of the epidemic that is going on.  
This event will start on Saturday March 21st at 13:00(GMT+1)  
We all start as a level 1 Troll(You will only get invited when you are a level 1 troll). Once people hit certain milestones we can invite other trolls to fill up our roster.

What we need :  
Community managers : People that can work with Discord and people that want to take up an officer role in the guild  
Raidleaders : People with enough experience to figure out some way to clear stuff voodo style.  
Trolls Milestones :  
Level 30  
level 40  
level 50  
level 60  
We do allow transfers once one of these milestones has been reached .

What I would like everyone to do : Promote the server in any way you can so we can start off with as much trolls as possible. Pick a class in class-signup . Vote on the poll make some friends Discord Server : [https://discord.gg/Y6mF4z7](https://discord.gg/Y6mF4z7)",41,1584701764,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/flt35l/the_zandalar_tribe_troll_only_guild_eu_come_join/,classicwow,1

AB and WSG are unplayable in their current state as horde. Forcing premade teams to only play other premades would pretty much solve most of it.

flpemj,machmademax,Looking for help to start off new,"Hi Redditors,

1. Short story about my start in classic wow. I started playing with 3 friends, i wanted to play a hunter.
Since one of the friends also wanted to play a hunter, and the other two decided to go mage and priest, i was like, oh we need a tank, so i choose a warrior. All of the 3 never reached 20 and quitted classic early, since i like classic wow very much i played my warrior to 54, also tried a druid (lvl 26). I never startet the hunter.

2. Yesterday i decided to start off new, but before i start again i want to ask you guys for a little help. What am i looking for:
- a nice communicative guild on an eu server (favored German server since im from Switzerland)
- maybe a guild of dad's like me that can only play a few evenings a week?
- horde/alliance is both welcome
- pvp/pve server doesn't matter
- but the server should be balanced

fln8lk,propyro85,How do I make the most of being assigned Nightfall duty?,"So in my guild I've been given the glorious duty of swinging Nightfall around on bosses that don't require Tranq Shot, rather than actually being a hunter.  Originally we had two Enhancement Shaman that were going to do it, but we needed them on healing more often than not, so it falls to the Hunter that almost never misses a raid. Rather than being excessively sour about it, I'm going to try to make the most of it and try to optimize myself as best I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, [this is where I'm at with my gear and spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/hunter/troll/AjwP8FBRUAUTBR8zICAiEDLwAEkaAUHOAkfkg0HQWEEFQc0GQdMHQc-IQdFON4lB0h5jikHUTiwLS30MSYUNNo0OSrCPQs42OhBK4RJJGQ), and I'm wondering where I should be going with it to at least try to put out some sort of damage worth mentioning.  Is it worth it to try farming HoJ to get the occasional double swing?  Should I try using an Enhancement Shaman's BIS list to build my gear up so I actually have some strength to add to my damage?  My enchantments are pretty minimal, I've been trying to gather up materials for some of the more expensive ones before I got reassigned.  Should I bother putting Crusader on Nightfall, or is there some other enchantment that would be more worth while?

&amp;#x200B;

My rotation is Rank 8 Raptor Strike on cooldown, and spamming Rank 1 Wing Clip just to get hit volume up to keep the proc up.  For bosses that periodically knock back, I've got Arcane Shot on my bar so I can at least pop one off while I try to get back to the boss.  My Wing Clip is on a macro where it also spams Furious Howl or Screech so I can either buff my group or debuff the boss a little while my pet is still alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else I should do, or am I just trying to polish a turd and my only concern is to keep the debuff up?",81,1584672181,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fln8lk/how_do_i_make_the_most_of_being_assigned/,classicwow,1

One of the reasons I wanted to try multiboxing was that I could farm for my own SGC and HoJ without having to rely on anyone else and so I'd like to know if you guys think it is possible to do BRD Arena and Angerforge on a warrior+shaman team and if so, what kinda gear is required? I have a feeling I won't be able to do it as soon as I hit 60 without getting some pre-bis or some other stuff like crafted items or such. What builds should I run on these two characters for something like this? Also, if like full pre-bis would be required or even more, should I maybe dedicate a week for each character and play them separately and try to get as much loot as possible in that time or how could I make gearing efficient?

However, while trying to change around it's design in the options, It's changed the cast fill bar colour to clear. Now I can't see the cast bar filling at all and there is NO way to change it back.

fl803m,theycallmeLEV,AITA - for wanting to join raid at lvl 56.,"So for some context I am still not lvl 60 for whatever reasons and time constraints. I am an experienced warrior planning on tanking. I am lvl 56 and just specced deep prot with good results (smooth brd tanking even with 60's in grp and gd aggro control).
I was hoping to join a mc run in my guild as i know it can be done before lvl 60 or even 25 good geared players but my guild said either im not high enough or i didnt fit in witht their speed run plans for the raid.
I was really disappointed as I was under the impression guilds were encouraging for new players to catch up especially as we approach ZG, i have more time to put in now so I am appealing to anyone in a guild on Razorgore EU pvp that maybe needs a new off tank or im even prepared to go fury if thats what the guild needs, really this is an appeal for help to do at least a couple mc runs before its not really run anymore, thanks guys.",14,1584614626,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fl803m/aita_for_wanting_to_join_raid_at_lvl_56/,classicwow,1

By the time I get back to the first target I've lost all threat and its killing my team.

I really want my dps to have fun and see big numbers so I don't strain on them. Sometimes if go as a dps and who ever is tanking has such a grasp over everthing. People are burning cds and the mobs are stuck to the tank like glue so it must be me that's doing something wrong. I feel like an awful tank. Any suggestions are very much appreciated.

Blizz can either start mass banning, or they can move the shed back a couple yards, so they can't get up there. Either way, something needs to be done. It's like every game there's some asshole up there holding stables.

I even contacted support through the chat function to see if I could help at all, but they wont discuss issues with a third party understandably. Today they upheld the ban. 

I don't know what evidence they have, but I do know he falls asleep even mid conversation in voice chat OFTEN. He also mentioned when he's discouraged in PvP he will go south to fish and be out of the way of the people that flame him.

fkx4ey,Crackvirus,Are my tanks bad?,"Look I don't have numbers or any reference to how raid tanking is done. I'm just a lowly healer noticing the struggle. 

Touching purely on the MT and OT, we have a steady threat issue that I just don't see other guilds on stream and youtube have. We have fury warriors casually pull aggro when they're only pulling 300-400dps while other guilds I see have 15 rogues/warriors pulling 600-800+ and never even remotely pull aggro. 

On Chromaggus last night, our OT could NOT maintain 2nd in threat at all. We had to eventually just make every fury warrior take the time lapse hit for the OT to maybe gain aggro.

It's not by any means a deal breaker, we still full clear BWL, I'm just curious if our tanks are doing something fundamentally wrong on fights like Vael and Chrom (time lapse). Especially our OT. We attempted to have him MT on Vael since he's fury/prot and has the quick dagger so it seemed logical. He lost threat pretty quickly and after 2 wipes we went back to our deep prot MT and one shot him.",81,1584565358,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fkx4ey/are_my_tanks_bad/,classicwow,1

fkv8eb,SouthernOpinion,Blizzard needs to do something about the people cheating in AB.,"People, mostly alliance, are getting on top of the roof of the stables, and using that position to hold the flag solo.   It's nearly impossible to take this location without a massive force, if they do this.  Which means the location is completely safe for them.  They don't have to worry about it, and they can just use the remaining 14 players to attack/defend 2 other locations. 

This has been known about since Vanilla, but unlike then, now everyone abuses exploits to the max.  

Blizz can either start mass banning, or they can move the shed back a couple yards, so they can't get up there.   Either way, something needs to be done.  It's like every game there's some asshole up there holding stables.

This is not intended, and it gives those players an unfair advantage.   Therefore, it's an exploit.  Don't bother even trying to argue otherwise.",57,1584558810,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fkv8eb/blizzard_needs_to_do_something_about_the_people/,classicwow,0

fkv1ks,Ansilo,The Zandalar Trib : Troll only EU raiding guild,"Hello everyone ,

My name is Roby and thank to reddituser : [u/Kalarrian](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kalarrian/) . I got this idea of starting a Troll only guild on the EU sever Zandalar Tribe(RP PVP)

The goal is to Raid with a full group of trolls and make it a challenge to overcome every fight this way.

This project is something I wanted to start now because allot of people have more free time on their hands because of the virus

This event will start on Saturday March 21st at 13:00(GMT+1)

We all start as a level 1 Troll(You will only get invited when you are a level 1 troll). Once someone hits level 60 we can start inviting level 60 Trolls to fill up our roster.

What we need :

A community girl/guy: Who helps out on discord and would be a officer rank in the guild

A discord tech : Someone who can work well with discord and could add the features we want

Experienced Raidleaders : I don't see myself as a raidleader

A ton of trolls

Discord Server : [https://discord.gg/BX2usq](https://discord.gg/BX2usq)

Stay healthy and Safe and I hope we get to see you in game.",22,1584558172,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fkv1ks/the_zandalar_trib_troll_only_eu_raiding_guild/,classicwow,1

fkudbk,ClassicPurist,DPS warriors having trouble getting geared - poetic justice?,"Let us get this out of the way first - I would say that 80-90% of the people who rolled a warrior did so because they read online that it was the overwhelming ""strongest"" class with the best DPS. They didn't roll a warrior for any reason other than to get every possible advantage (or so they thought).

As it turns out, whether pservers had some numbers wrong, or an exceptional amount of noobs/shitters rolled warrior in classic, they in fact share the top DPS spot with rogues (apart from the top top guilds where fury warriors pull clearly ahead, see page 1 &amp; 2).

[https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1002#metric=dps&amp;partition=2&amp;class=DPS&amp;page=3](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1002#metric=dps&amp;partition=2&amp;class=DPS&amp;page=3)

And while rogues are competing with 3-5 other people in the raid for gear, fury warriors are competing with 8-12, as well as directly competing with MT for a ton of pieces.

Soon all the other classes will get everything they need from MC and no longer want to run that raid, and fury warriors will be shit out of luck, stuck with Mirah's Song forever or until they get some ""upgrade"" from ZG that doesn't quite hit the spot.

Let this be a warning to everyone, you should have chosen the class you wanted to play and liked the most, not what pserver neckbeards told you was better.",41,1584555836,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fkudbk/dps_warriors_having_trouble_getting_geared_poetic/,classicwow,3

Now that I got perd blade, I would like to go with daggers. Dropped distracting dagger for this combo.
The problem is I have no idea how to generate threat with it...
No matter what I do, I cant get agro with them. Whereas with super slow and heavy hitting DB I had no problems with it. Especially with worldbuffs combo DB+perd in OH!+edgies is frickin op.
Could you tell me what is a proper rotation for daggers build and what I may be doing wrong?
Im spamming heroic strikers with BT on cd. Most of time I dont even have rage for BT...
But if I spam heroic que I dont generate enough threat.

fkqw6v,ClassicKrova,Druid PvP question - HOTW vs Balance/Resto in AB and has the honor grind become a little more reasonable?,"With the release of AB, I've found that alliance Pugs in AB seem to do a better job communicating and trying to win, making the entire experience a lot more pleasant then before.

First, Looking for advice for people who have been playing the whole time on spec, and here are things to consider on my end:

* Trying to figure out whether HOTW or Balance/Resto is a better spec to grind AB with.
* I have + 200 - 240 Spell Power in my SP gear.
* In AB, during long engagements, running OOM is a real problem, so being more effective in Bear Form and Cat Form can lead to a lot of better plays, also saving more of my mana for healing instead of damage output.
* I have a decent set of ""Melee PvP DPS"" items to compliment HOTW pretty well. 

In AV, Balance/Resto was 100% the best choice because of my ability to spot heal, but also sit somewhere out of LOS and spam big Starfire+Moonfire combos on targets. I killed my backline horde like this. In AB, we have a lot more ""In your face"" gameplay, and it seems like relying on forms will be a bigger benefit, but I want professional opinion!

Subquestion is: Has the Honor grind inflation let off a little bit?",27,1584543762,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fkqw6v/druid_pvp_question_hotw_vs_balanceresto_in_ab_and/,classicwow,1

don\`t know, if this has been asked before, but i haven\`t found anything here about that.

I came across a chat in my guild, that someone wanted some other to purchase a specific epic mount.  
They said, that wouldn\`t be possible, until someone posted in chat, that it would be only  ""bound after use"". Pretty self explanatory, but we weren\`t sure, even after that, if it would be tradeable.

My questions now are:  
1. Can someone buy an epic mount and trade it?  
2. Could i, as a human, use a NE cat, if bought for me, and still ride it, even if i\`m not exalted with darnassus?

fkgdqb,Goon_tv,Premade WSG/AB -- simple strats to help chances of winning 1st fight,"Im looking for other easy-to-execute  teamfight strats that tend to help increase the chances of winning 1st fight at warsong (midfield) and ab (BS) against strong, high ranked premades

&amp;#x200B;

What have your premades been doing?  I get that in an ideal world your premade would be really well coordinated and all play together to execute a cohesive 1st fight strat, but realistically, I find as few as 3-4 synchronized players all doing the same type of teamfight strategy can drastically help winning these crucial fights.

&amp;#x200B;

Some popular ones I've seen are:

\-\[H\] x2 Warrior FAP and charge/intercept/burst an Alliance Priest thats too far forward dispelling buffs (with shaman/mage/lock burst globals).

\-Warrior charge rush with a Mage flank &gt; Blink &gt; Nova backline

\-\[H\] funnel resources into Shaman with berserker/PI, warriors rush and tag anyone with MS and global someone for first kill

\-\[A\] Freedomed Warrior rush with BoP'd Mage flank &gt; blink &gt; Nova backline (just like Alliance raid v raid dives)  


Our bread and butter is this:  (with a core of \[A\] Warrior, Hunter, Lock, Paladin coordinated)  
\-We play first fights really defensively (like disgustingly defensively) -- Hunter and Lock just control space and force enemy mages/locks/priests away from our paladin so he can freecast before bubbling.  Feels pretty similar to playing Warrior/Lock comps for arena rats out there

\-Warrior bounces around with intercept and tags MS on overextenders/dotted targets

\-Paladin Freedoms the warrior, BoPs the Lock (or a priest), &amp; bubble pumps heals before getting locked.  


What have you guys been doing?  I get that playing a scripted teamfight isnt so common for premades under helmet levels, but I'm finding most very sweaty premades tend to put the extra thought into specifically how they hope to win 1st fight for middle of the map priority for the game, thats kinda what im looking to hear what others are doing here

&amp;#x200B;

I'm farming gold like crazy on my mage at the moment and sitting on a lot.  My main is a tank, and I'm considering blowing a bunch of gold on lotuses and other mats for future content.  I figure gold inflation is likely to continue to creep, so stocking up on materials and consumables right now that I know I will need is a safer bet.

fkbt8s,Geryth04,Deathrolling! Is it a fair game or a scam?,"Hey guys! We all know that people love using math and statistics to scam people (carnivals, casinos etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

So I was curious about death rolling. Is there a hidden way to increase your chances of winning? Are chronic death rollers desperate gamblers in need of help? Or are they gaming the system and hustling people (beyond the ones that simply don't pay out when they lose) and making mad money?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm no mathmetician, but I am a programmer. I'd be hard pressed to find any formulae that explain with any accuracy the chances to win a deathrolling game. So I wrote a program and hit it with millions of games to figure this out via the Monte Carlo method.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as a reminder, let's go over the rules of the game. You wager an amount of gold, let's say 10. Then each player takes turns rolling. The first roll is 10 times the amount of gold wagered, so in our 10 gold deathroll game, the first roll is out of 100. Each subsequent roll uses the results of the last roll as the top-end. For instance, if the first player rolled a 72, the second player then rolls 1-72. The game continues alternating rolls like this until a player rolls a 1. The player who rolls a 1 loses.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

1) Can you give yourself an advantage by deciding who rolls first?

2) Can you give yourself an advantage by choosing a specific number to roll with?

&amp;#x200B;

The answers are slightly complicated. Let's look at some of the results of my simulations.

&amp;#x200B;

=====================

When rolling with a top end of 1:

Player 2 won 1000000 games

Player 1 won 0 games

&amp;#x200B;

This makes sense because the first player who rolls a 1 loses and the player who rolls first always rolls a 1. No one would ever play a death roll game like this, but its results are interesting none-the-less and provide a bit of insight on the rest of the results.

&amp;#x200B;

=====================

When rolling with a top end of 2:

Player 2 won 666278 games

Player 1 won 333722 games

&amp;#x200B;

Well now, that's something! Thinking it through logically it also makes sense. If you're flipping a coin, the person who goes first has a 50/50 chance of just losing on their first flip. But ""winning"" the first flip doesn't win the game, it's just player 2's turn now. So essentially player 2 has the advantage by giving player 1 the opportunity to lose first. But, again, a deathroll game out of 2 just isn't practical or realistic. But it also provides insight as to whether or not you can give yourself an advantage. Is there something to rolling second?

&amp;#x200B;

=====================

Let's skip a head and look at the next few top-end rolls:

&amp;#x200B;

When rolling with a top end of 3:

Player 2 won 583518 games

Player 1 won 416482 games

&amp;#x200B;

When rolling with a top end of 4:

Player 2 won 549326 games

Player 1 won 450674 games

&amp;#x200B;

When rolling with a top end of 5:

Player 2 won 533834 games

Player 1 won 466166 games

&amp;#x200B;

When rolling with a top end of 10:

Player 2 won 508707 games

Player 1 won 491293 games

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm, the higher we go the closer to 50/50 we get. We're only at 10 which is a single gold wagered and we're already at only a 50.9% chance to win by going second. It seems there's only a benefit to going second, and that benefit becomes negigible very quickly. Let's skip to a standard 10 gold deathroll game and see the chances of winning when starting the roll out of 100:

&amp;#x200B;

When rolling with a top end of 100:

Player 2 won 500002 games

Player 1 won 499998 games

&amp;#x200B;

So any benefit to going second is all but gone at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

=====================

=====================

In conclusion the answer is a technical yes, but only if going second and starting death rolls with unrealistically low wagers. I ran simulations with rolls starting from 1 to 100 and it looks like around 30 is when it's pretty much a 50/50 chance regardless of who goes first. 36 was the first set of deathroll games where player 1 won more games than player 2.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you're going to deathroll then always roll second for a negligible advantage. If anyone tries any bullshit to change the rules to start the roll with a low number then call them out on it. Starting the roll at 10 times the amount wagered is actually a great rule that keeps the game more or less fair.",29,1584474753,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fkbt8s/deathrolling_is_it_a_fair_game_or_a_scam/,classicwow,0

The one thing that irks me the most is when we go as Ally to the middle of the map near Balinda we meet the horde INFRONT of Snowfall Graveyard - the GY thats supposed to be ""in the middle"", hell theyre even at Belinda before ally if they run fast enough. It's utterly nonsense tbh.

Imagine playing dodge ball and the balls in ""the middle"" is 30% closer to a team.

Ally of this thread, have you guys found a tactic that works somewhat? I find that ""going left"" is suicide at least for my experience.",2,1584473337,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fkbegm/state_of_av_as_pug_alliance/,classicwow,1

I had mana on my Robe of the exalted because it was realtively cheap but just got T2 and was wondering why +4stats is listed as BIS. Its 100 mana vs 60 mana and 40 health.

\- Faster OH:

Cons: Eats up flurry for less damage

Pro: Chance to proc crusader more often / procs flurry often

\- Slower OH:

Cons: Less furry procs / less crusader procs

Pro: More damage on flurry procs as you will do more main hand Strikes

&amp;#x200B;

OBS: I don't care about rage generation, because as I am tanking, I will generate rage by getting hit by bosses

I believe also that with a slower OH, you can keep flurry up more often as the flurry will be consumed slower and it gives you more time to crit again because bloodthirst have always  the same cooldown and bloodthirst don't consume flurry charges.

(I already have a Warrior and Rogue, I will not list them here)

I am most interested in Mage and Priest, however also Shaman, but there’s some things about Shamans I don’t like.

Do I have to use totems consistently as an Ele spec in PvP, lvl 60? If yes, I’m really not keen on Shaman. Alternatively, how good is Enhancement Shaman at level 60?

I don’t like having a pet, so Hunter is off.

That leaves Mage and Priest. 

I think Shadow Priest looks cool, but I tried some minor leveling of a Priest and it feels so slow and boring. If my intuition tells me that already at level 5, I don’t want to waste a lot of time on rolling Priest.

Mage is cool, but I also think it’s the most overused class and that it’s just «frost AoE poly make water» like hella repetitive, but I’m willing to give Mage a chance.

fk60lw,GnollCWB,I made a tool for tracking your server world buffs in classic,"Hi all, Gnoll here from the Oceanic Arugal server.

&amp;#x200B;

Having been quarantined at home these past few weeks I started working on this buff cooldown tracker [classicworldbuffs.com](https://classicworldbuffs.com/?src=rclassicwow) It's very new so I'd appreciate any and all feedback.

The primary function is to record when you see buffs go out,  and it needs the community to upvote\\downvote times based on whether they are correct.

How it came about is we have a Discord for our server which works very well, but with thousands of members it gets spammy, and lots of repeated questions about when something is going to drop. The idea was to create something to supplement that, and it's been going well for our server the past week.

I'd also like to acknowledge there are a number of great addons for tracking your worldbuffs in game, but it is handy having something you can check on your phone\\pc outside game, to see when you should login. That's the theory at least, let me know if you do find it useful, or not! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Known issues:

* Needs a bunch of community members voting to reach consensus on times to prevent trolling
* The signup system needs a parse for your character on warcraftlogs (for validation), which works poorly for Rends buff, as it's likely the character has not raided yet.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I know Ashkandi is mainly a Hunter weapon.  My Guild's luck with 2 handers is just terrible.  All the months we've raided MC, and ZERO Bone Reaver's Edges have dropped among BOTH raid groups!  ZERO! We literally just got an Eye off Rag last week.  We've had a few OBE's, which I'm using now as a Horde Fury Warrior.

What I really want is the Untamed Blade from Razorgore!  I know it'll be a slight DPS boost from the OBE (there was a post somewhere with numbers).  I literally got OBE the very first week raiding MC many many many months ago.  I would love to get and use SOMETHING else at this point.  We've kinda stopped running MC for now, since we've been clearing BWL and since BRE never drops.

Someone talk me outta trying to claim the Ashkandi if it drops first.  If UTB drops, then we shouldn't have any issues.

fk2jci,marcphero,Highest skill cap classes to play,"Hey guys,

I'm looking for advice on which class I should play. I'm interested in a class that has a dynamic ability rotation. In other words, I really don't want to be stuck only using 1 or 2 abilities at end game. I've heard that hunters have a variety of rotations given the encounter in PvP, but are pretty weak in raids. I played a mage in WotLK, but PvE was too straight forward. Ideally, I pick a class that is fun and exciting to play both in PvP and PvE.

To get an idea of the type of player that I am, I play Zerg in Starcraft because you have a lot more macro management throughout the game e.g. spreading creep, laying eggs, etc. I find Protoss to be a bit boring since macro is pretty straight forward, so you end up only needing to worry about micro.

I've titled this post 'highest skill cap' because I think that most represents what I'm looking for in a class. That's not to say you don't have to be good to play a mage, but I definitely want to get creative with a class and still compete in PvE and PvP.

I was on the bottom of them not because I could do more dmg but because on every boss fight I had to stop doing damage because of threat issues?!

Even if I did backstab - feint - backstab -feint and so on, vanish when just below tank, repeat it all when the boss is around 50% HP I dont have another vanish to get rid of threat so I just have to stop hitting literally and wait behind them, staring at nothing.

This way they do much more dmg overall.

I must be doing something wrong, what is it?  
I dont go full send from the beginning, rather climb my way slowly and never backstab in the first 10ish seconds so the tank can get his aggro better.

fk28bt,StipsFinTech,HALVING YOUR DEPOSIT HAS ALREADY GOT,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 4c0tomyv97n41...*

🔥This day will be remembered by the cryptocurrency community for a long time: market capitalization fell by 50% per day, Bitcoin also by 50% — the extreme price on the BITSTAMP exchange is $ 3850, Ethereum fell 55%, below $ 90. Losses of top altcoins per day reached an average of 60%.

Meanwhile, the employees of the top crypto exchanges didn\`t disappoint their users, but did as BitMEX: the Huobi and Bithumb exchanges encountered performance problems and users were unable to fulfill applications or go to the site. “Goodbye, dear deposit!” See you soon!”. Of course, similar problems were observed at the BitMEX website.

*To date, the performance of the platforms has been fully restored, but this is only now.*

**📍**What briefly happened?

📉First, the support line, which dates back to 2015, collapsed by $ 7500- $ 7300, after which the price for several minutes was below $ 6000 (all traders have already caught a long squeeze here). After 12-hour consolidation in the range of $ 5700- $ 6100, the price of the first cryptocurrency continued its free fall, updating the annual minimum below $ 4000.

**❓**Causes

🔍The big sale was influenced by the situation in traditional markets. Global financial indices fell by more than 25% in two weeks, and this was a record drop since 1987! Bitcoin used to show an inverse correlation with the S&amp;P 500 with minor drops caused by local problems. But today, when a full-scale catastrophe occurs in the stock market, Bitcoin is falling along with the stock market and even overtaking it due to its small capitalization and low liquidity.

Obviously, investors don’t perceive cryptocurrencies as a defensive asset, and sell when problems arise, as well as to pay off margin calls in traditional markets. The decline in bitcoin to the levels of the beginning of 2019 instigated panic and a massive drain, which made the inexperienced crypto-traders even worse and the collapse continued even in their panic.

**💡**What to do next?

&gt;*📍If you are not afraid to form a long-term portfolio of cryptocurrencies, then you can think about starting to buy a much cheaper portfolio of altcoins and BTC.*

👉If you are a supporter of entering the market for short-term or day trading, we recommend that you wait for a clearer technical picture at least at 1 hour BTC timeframe. Since there is panic on the market now, the daily volatility has reached the limit at which it is no longer possible to trade. It is better to wait for this period in the 💰cash(fiat) and watch the market from the outside. A road to $3500- $2000 is also possible.",0,1584436820,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fk28bt/halving_your_deposit_has_already_got/,classicwow,1

fk1wge,Kalarrian,A look at the viability of single race guilds in raids,"With the dwarf only guild making headlines in this sub, I decided to take a look at how viable single race guilds are.

When you look at the viability, the most important apsect are the available classes. Lack of abiltiy to dispel a certain debuff type is generally the biggest problem a single race raid can face and has to work their way around that with restoration potions. Tanking and dps is no problem as every race can be a warrior. The only challenge is handling all the boss mechanics.

Here's what each class brings:

* Warrior: tank
* Paladin: heal, blessings, auras, dispel magic, poison, disease
* Shaman: heal, totems, dispel poison, disease, purge magic
* Hunter: tranq shot
* Druid: heal, motw, faerie fire, dispel poison, curse
* Rogue: -
* Priest: heal, fortitude, shadow protection, dispel magic, disease, purge magic
* Mage: dispel curse, polymorph
* Warlock: curses, banish, healthstone, limited dispel magic.
 
**Impossible tier**

*8th - Gnome*

Gnomes have access to four classes: Warrior, rogue, mage, warlock. They lack any class capable of healing and as such a gnome only raid is nigh on impossible, making them the only race with that distinction.

**Possible, but severe problems tier**

*7th - Orcs*

The prime horde race lacks access to priests, druids and mages. This means they can only shaman as healers and are incapable of dispelling curses and magic. (Well, warlock felhunters do have some limited magic dispelling ability). This lack of dispels will make many fights a lot harder.

*6th - Undead*

Undead are missing Shaman, Hunter and Druid. This means no tranq shot and no poison dispel. While poison is not too relevant now, it will be troublesome in AQ and Naxx making those raids much harder and the missing tranq shot will make several bosses a lot more troublesome as well.

*5th - Tauren*

Tauren only have access to 4 classes: Warrior, Hunter, Shaman and Druid, they lack rogue and all cloth classes. Despite that, they are actually fairly well equipped. They lack a magic dispeller, which is very troublesome on several fights, especially Chromaggus and Geddon. No Mages and locks also means limited cc, which is a problem for Domo and Garr as well as some trash.

*4th - Dwarves*

Dwarves lack Druids, Mages and Warlocks, they are  missing a curse dispeller, which is troublesome in molten core and Nefarian, but not important anywhere else except for Nefarian and Noth. As with Tauren they lack cc. As curses are overall the least severe debuff type, I put them at the top of this tier.

**Viable with little problems tier**

*3rd - Human*

Humans are only missing hunters and druids. So essentially they lack tranq shot, motw and faerie fire. That's it. Tranq shot is a big problem on some bosses, but apart from those a human raid will basically be on par with any normal raid.

*2nd - Night Elf*

Night Elves are the first race with the complete package, they lack paladin, mage and warlock, so basically the same as dwarves just with druid instead of paladin. This enables the curse dispel, the only thing missing from the dwarf raid. They also lack the cc and the paladin buffs, which makes execution quite a bit harder, but manageable.

**Fully viable tier**

*1st - Trolls*

Trolls are the best single race guild. They only lack druids and warlocks, which really only makes Garr a bit harder. Apart from that they lack curses and druid buffs, which hampers their dps a bit, but that is it, they are fully functional otherwise.",278,1584434860,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fk1wge/a_look_at_the_viability_of_single_race_guilds_in/,classicwow,1

fjy872,ClassicPurist,Let us cease with this foolishness about Horde having a natural PvP advantage,"As all/most of you have probably seen from AB, ally pugs pretty much crush horde pugs almost every time.

Stun resist and a fear break every 2 mins is pretty much evened out by the existence of paladins on the other side. Amazing healers who wear plate and can stun, escape certain death on CD, and do damage. And give insane buffs.

Allies also tend to have a much higher proportion of people who enjoy/want to heal. On the horde if a shammy is healing, it's because he was pressured into it.

This was always obvious to me in AV in the battles around SHGY. We focus on the fact that Horde ends up winning the game (most likely due to map imbalance) but we don't focus on the fact that it usually takes the Horde 2 or 3 or 4 or.... 10 tries to finally get SHGY.

I don't know why people don't really pay attention to this. It means that allies will almost always beat us in open battle and the only way we win is literally by overwhelming them with one wave after another.

Mind you, I'm not saying that this is some kind of imbalance that should be addressed.

Like I said, I think the alliance naturally attracts the kinds of people who enjoy healing, and this in turn reflects itself in usually winning open pvp battles which are the staple of more balanced Bg's such as AB.

Screenshots from my brothers in arms.

Arathi Basin is my second favorite place in Azeroth after Warsong Gulch. However, I really can't enjoy AB since SO MANY ppl are abusing the roof.

I don't know what's going on in US server, but GM virtually doesn't care Korean server at all so reporting is a just waste of time.

I support #nochange, but I think this is something that needs to be changed.

Are there more people who suffer from this? Let's make some CHANGE",32,1584412903,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fjxmpu/roof_exploit_in_arathi_basin/,classicwow,1

fjvmaj,Sparcrypt,AHK script for an always on top window.,"With so many people working from home the next few weeks I suspect more than a couple of people need to be able to keep an eye on work things but would like some media in the corner of their screen.... or would like to be playing WoW but need to keep an eye on some work thing in the corner of their screen. Whichever.

Anyway, lots of programs have an always on top feature, however I find a simple AHK script to be far more practical. It works for every window and is easy to toggle on/off.

The Script:

    #NoEnv  
    SendMode Input  
    SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  
    
    ^SPACE::  Winset, Alwaysontop, , A

How to use:

1. [Download AHK from here](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Yes it is safe, **no** you will not be banned unless you start using it to play the game for you. 
2. Save the above to a text file and name it 'ontop.ahk' (or whatever, the .ahk bit is what matters). 
3. When you want to use it double click on it to run it.
4. When you have the window you want to force to be on top selected, press CTRL+Spacebar. Press it again to disable.
5. That's it!

If you want to use a difference key combo you can change the script. \^SPACE is the part that determines the combo but if you don't like it or worry you'll accidentally hit it then you can [look up the key commands here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm) and change it to whatever you like. So if you prefer using ALT+BREAK you would have the following line instead:

    !PAUSE::  Winset, Alwaysontop, , A

Side note I've worked for myself/from home for years now. If anybody wants some tips on staying productive and all that jazz happy to help though it's best summed up by ""don't fall in to the trap of thinking working from home = a day off"".

I know troll is better for pve, but is that going to make that much of a difference in this scenario?  As far as lvling goes, is beserker + bows better than orc's 5% to pets?

fjtghu,natehax,"Blizz, enormous marketing opportunity here...why are you wasting it?","As the US and many other countries go into forced lockdowns, curfews, or even just 'expanded telework', Blizz has a golden opportunity: a captive audience of potentially millions who, once the initial panic is gone, will be hunkered down for the long haul as COVID-19 runs through the world's population.

Why not tap into this expanded market with some smart marketing of WoW Classic?  Zul'Gurub is only weeks away from dropping, with coincidentally one of the most FASCINATING viral mechanics ever encountered in a game: Corrupted Blood.

IF I WERE A SMART MEMBER OF BLIZZARD'S MARKETING DEPARTMENT, I would propose the following:

1.  Release ZG a few weeks early to coincide with the last week of March/first week of April.
2.  Offer an 'Epidemic Relief Discount' for the first month(s?) of the mandatory lockdowns.
3.  As maybe an April Fool's prank...allow Corrupted Blood with #nochanges.
4.  Revel in the copious amounts of press you get from both the good will of offering the game to bored adults who might otherwise go outside and cause trouble, and the scientific community who still remember the Corrupted Blood incident and the effects it has had on epidemiology.
5.  Get an enormous infusion of new players due to the current world climate at almost zero risk.

One post which was made when classic rereleased said wait 6 months (so now) and it’s should sell for 1-2k but I haven’t had much interest. - I did have one offer for 700g and was unsure.

fjpegr,Captain_Fordo_ARC_77,Phase 4 confusion: patch 1.8.0 content seems to be missing from the PTR,"Every announcement I read states the green dragons are coming with Zul'Gurub. The nightmare dragons came with patch 1.8.0 which also included an overhaul of the Silithus zone and the Cenarion Circle reputation. The green dragons can be skinned for Dreamscales which can be used to craft the Dreamscale breastplate ( [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dreamscale\_Breastplate](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dreamscale_Breastplate) ). The pattern for this has to be bought from the Cenarion Circle and requires exalted reputation. The dragons and the silithus overhaul seem too connected to be released separately.

Patch 1.8.0 also introduced a lot of nature resistance gear ( [https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=238:27;3:2;4:1#items:0-15-13+20](https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=238:27;3:2;4:1#items:0-15-13+20)) to prepare for AQ. Part of which drops from the green dragons and a part which comes from the Cenarion Circle. The Cenarion Circle also introduces other items like shadow resistance gear ( [https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=238:29;3:2;4:1](https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=238:29;3:2;4:1) ). 

I'm afraid they are pushing the Silithus overhaul to phase 5 (even though phase 4 was announced to include 1.7 and 1.8 content) but that will mean that we can't prepare for AQ until AQ is already out. That also means that pvpers will have to wait on amazing resistance gear pieces longer than in the original time line.

Here is the excerpt from the 1.8.0 patch notes.

* Microsoft Surface Pro X looks like an ipad sized windows tablet, but some things I read said WoW does not run on this. Has anyone tried?
* I know the general surfaces will work, but they kind of look lap uncomfortable.

Any thoughts appreciated!

fjn8rc,davehkiin08,Alternative to Hardcore Challenge Mode,"# Attention Hardcore Community!

Tired of starting over? Wish you didn't have to delete on death after more than a day of playtime? Sick of playing on a PvE server?

I am proposing a new challenge mode. Here's my idea...

**Same ruleset as Hardcore with ONE exception:**

Levels 1-10: Death = Delete

Levels 11-60: Death = Lose all your *liquid* gold... can be sent to a main or a friend.

*PvP Deaths DO NOT COUNT (okay... that was 2 exceptions)*

# I call it... SoulsCore

It's important that these challenges present a significant penalty upon death but I feel that death = delete promotes a play-style for some that is essentially not fun due to the fear of deletion. It's more fun to take risks, to push the boundaries of what you think you could do while at the same time making that risk feel punishing. I feel that having to start over is too steep of a consequence for someone who enjoys the challenge but doesn't have the time to keep making new characters to progress through leveling. PvP is also my favorite part of Classic and I hate the idea of missing out on that experience in the open world.

This is obviously not intended to replace the challenge for completing a Hardcore play-through to 60 but I think the benefits of playing the game this way can still be enjoyed in a slightly more casual atmosphere. BIG shout out to Kargoz and friends for building the Hardcore community and saving us from the throngs of the min/max lifestyle!

Catch me streaming this ruleset at [twitch.tv/davehkiin08](https://twitch.tv/davehkiin08) as well as leave comments to discuss more. I'd like to know what people think and if there are any recommendations for a different type of death penalty.",3,1584374450,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fjn8rc/alternative_to_hardcore_challenge_mode/,classicwow,1
fjn44c,MrFlyingTurtles,Viability of a Casual Warrior?,"Hello! I'm a new player who hasn't gotten past level 15 on a character yet because I've been busy with school and such, but I've finally found a character/faction combo I really like: Human warrior on an RPPVP server. I really enjoy the difficulty of levelling and how each upgrade feels super meaningful, how I'm forced to interact with other players for help, how I learn to love paladins for duos, etc. With the coronavirus quarantine and spring break coming up, I have a nice break from school to really waste my life on this game and level a warrior to hopefully mid-20s.

However, I keep seeing everywhere that the warrior is a huge time commitment at endgame. Supposedly, I'll be expected to appear at every raid night and I won't be accepted into guilds if I can't give considerable amounts of my time to WoW. Is this true? I really like warrior so far (it has the best rp, class fantasy, combat feel, etc), but if I'm expected to devote my life to this thing, I'mma have to give up on WoW. Are there guilds that would accept a casual warrior who can only raid maybe once a night? Is there a better class for casuals that isn't a one button rotation?

fjly8k,Ve3tz,From one hunter to another. The comparisons of weapons.,"Multiple discussions have been popping up on hunter priority with certain weapons. I'm not here to tell you how to play or itemize your class, the beauty of playing wow is experimenting specs and learning new approaches to your class. With that being said, I'd like to consolidate a list of items I've put together that new hunters can easily reach for before raiding. Before I begin, I'd like to state that many of these numbers are estimations and should be rounded up or down and not taken to a decimal point. This is merely a guide to itemizing your class to maximize ranged dps. Discussions of melee weaving should be separate and not accounted for because of restrictions with classics engine, spell batching, situational awareness, healer mana conservation ( as well as hunters) etc.


Stat conversions we focus on in current phase item levels unbuffed:

1% critical strike chance = 32 to 34 AP equivalency

1 agility = 2.3 to 2.5 AP equivalency

When discussion AP, it is assumed as ranged attack power only.




**Barbarous blade** 
(60 attack power + 1% critical strike)

60 AP + 

1% crit( 32AP)+ 

15agi enchant (34.6AP)

= 126.6 AP equivalency



**Peacemaker**
(54 attack power + 1% critical strike)

= 122.6 AP equivalency



**2x Bone slicing hatchets**
(13 agility per)

26 agi(59.8 AP) +

2x agi 15 agility enchants (69 AP) +

~1% crit from agility stacking ( 32 AP)

=160.8 AP equivalency



**2x Assassination blade**
(1% crit per)

2% crit ( 44 AP)+

2x 15 agility enchants ( 69 AP)+

~.5% crit from agility stacking ( 16 AP)

= 129 AP equivalency



**2x Ribsplitter of agility**
(11 agility + 10 Attack power per)

22 agility ( 50.6 AP)

20 AP

2x 15 agility enchants ( 69 AP)

~1% crit from agility stacking ( 32 AP) 


= 171.6 AP equivalency



*Seperating corehound tooth and brutality blade for different combinations*


**Corehound tooth**
(1% critical strike + 20 AP)

1% Crit ( 32 AP)

20 AP

15 agility enchant ( 34.5 AP)

~0.25% crit ( 8 AP)

=94.5 AP equivalency



**Brutality blade**
(9 agility + 1% critical strike)

1% Crit ( 32 AP)

9 Agility ( 20.7 AP)

15 agility enchant ( 34.5 AP)

fjlem0,Putin_1v1me_fgt,Don’t lie to people and waste their time.,"So earlier I joined a group that wanted to run BRD in full. The group leader was a 60 fury warrior.. you can probably guess where this is going. Straight away he asked if we would be alright to do a few arena runs before our full clear. We agree and move on. After the 4th run we go outside to reset and surprisingly the game bugs and he can no longer enter. 

Now this may be the case (it’s not), but after telling me EXACTLY how many arena runs you had done for a chance to get the glorious SGC, you revealed your true intentions. 

Many WoW players get on as and when they can. They just wanna hit 60. They don’t have time to grind out 300+ arena runs. They just wanna clear the dungeon once, finished the quests and be on our way. 

Not being open and honest in the game has a knock on effect to those around you. Don’t lie and hide yourself intentions for your own greed. There’s enough of that in the real world, don’t bring it to Azeroth.

fjkfqe,AlwaysVoidwards,[Results] Vanilla WoW Community Poll 2020,"Fellow Vanilla Players,  


I hope you're doing well in this unexpected times of global pandemics. Some of you may remember a [poll being posted quite some time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fbage9/vanilla_wow_community_profile_in_2020/). While the questionnaire itself was online for quite a short time, it took more of it for me to post - real life quests got me occupied. For that delay, I apologize.  


To everyone so eagerly involved - thank you a lot! I was surprised, how quickly the answer were appearing. It only shows your passion and dedication to the Vanilla movement.

To those few, that may remain interested, here are some of the conclusions, as well as the [raw data file to download](https://files.fm/f/38aygy5u):  


 Research sample = 1012

\- 93% of Players are male,

\- 83% of Players are between 21 and 35 years old,

\- 31% are people between 26 and 30 years, which makes them the most numerous range,

\- there is almost equal distribution of Players between EU (48,85%) and US (47,8%) regions, 3,3% of the population comes from Oceanic region, **HOWEVER**

\- almost complete lack of answers from Asian community may - probably - be a thing due to the lack of sufficient language skills in English. Inclusion of their answers may have significantly changed the results of the questionnaire,

\- preferred language is, as expected, English,

\- 9,1% of the studied population has no experience with Vanilla WoW at all,

\- 34,1% of Players consider themselves as experienced (4 out of 5 on an subjective experience scale) in Vanilla, making them the most numerous group,

\- 15,7% of the population consider themselves a Vanilla WoW veterans,

\- 78,5% of the population has **at least** average experience,

\- almost half of the studied population (48,6%) considers the original 2004-2007 release as their main source of vanilla experience,

\- 35% of the studied population considers current Classic (1.13) version as their main source of vanilla experience,

\- 11,8% of the Players claims, that Private Servers are their main source of vanilla experience,

\- 78,6% of the studied population currently plays WoW Classic (1.13),

\- most of the Players (91,2%) are interested in PvE (Raids mostly) and it's the most frequently marked activity. Second one are social activities (50,2%), PvP is on the third place (44,6%). Not far behind is lvling new characters (41,7%),

\- RP'ers are  7,9% of the Population,

\- most popular MMOs among Vanilla WoW players are: Guild Wars 1/2, SW: ToR, Runescape and TES: Online,

\- 50,2% of studied Players seek gaming news on Discord **on a daily basis.** 64,6% do so on Reddit.

\- 71,2% of studied Players don't use Facebook **at all** (as a source of gaming news), 78% doesn't seek gaming news on Instagram,

\- a little bit more flat dispersion is shown when it comes to YouTube as a source of gaming news. On a 5-point scale, 68% of the Population marked the answer ""3"" or higher, when it comes to frequency of using YT for gaming news.",55,1584363004,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fjkfqe/results_vanilla_wow_community_poll_2020/,classicwow,1

fjj4bb,whatsinaname159,[EU] Classic wow boosting initiative.,"Hi fellow redditors,

I'm going to go ahead and wish everyone a ""good"" quarantaine period. Remember to wash your hands and don't stockpile toilet paper. Leave some for the rest of us.  
Hope your loved ones stay safe!

Anyway, seeing as I and many others are quarantained and have to work from home with a lot of restrictions this enables me to free up a lot of time for video games.

Therefore to create some sense of community and to take my mind off of the mind numbing leveling process in wow, I present you with a leveling initiative.

&amp;#x200B;

**Setup:**

1 Frost mage (level 60)

4 leveling toons (requirement to start: level 10)

&amp;#x200B;

**How does it work?**

Watch Arlaeus' channel for more information on how he made this work:

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGneqbCH2iAPiD3EbYAiFiw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGneqbCH2iAPiD3EbYAiFiw)

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DW :** aoe boosting 4 lower level characters. Why 4? It lowers the group average level and boosts the XP gained for the whole party.

&amp;#x200B;

**What will you gain from it?**

Since we will be taking turns after reaching 60, you will gain multiple toons out of the leveling service. (level 50 or higher)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why would you sign up and spend countless of hours?**

To make this quarantaine fun and a bit varied while still getting gametime in.

&amp;#x200B;

**What will it cost me?**

EVERYTHING \*Thanos\*. 

No seriously, this will cost you time and time only.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to sign up?**

Message me with your availability, schedule and how many full toon runs you will like to be included on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Any other questions?**

fjiz7d,The_Quackin,Views on classic Wow after 6 months,"First, let me say I'm sorry for the broken english.

As written in the title I've been playing classic for a few months now, guild is farming Bwl etc. 

First, views on the mentality, people are elitist as fuck I mean they got this pseudo sense of superiority over the accomplishement of speed farming a 15 years old raid, they spit on blizzard daily about "" muh no content"" and they're like ""huh did you see player X? He doesn't got voracity on his helmet, he is dragging all the raid done"". 
Classic is like a tiny echo chamber for all those insufferable dickheads, and it's starting to get on my nerves.
Ohhh, and don't get me started on the retail bashing, which in my opinion provides the only viable content for people looking for an actual challenge.
And sorry but in my opinion speed running is by no means an enjoyable way to challenge 40 individuals into anything.
Also I don't want to spend 10 hours farming / spending 100 gold to win 15 min on a raid.

There, it is out of my system.

fjim4j,Fegmdute,Stop trying to win wsg at every cost!!!,"I May be a minority. Whenever i join a wsg pug, we rush out on the field and go ham. We try to get the flag, but if the opposite team Got it 1-0 then i just afk. So Many people Go mad for this: “stop afking”, “report xxxxx”. This is assuming it’s not vs a premade, if it is i just try to def in flag room maybe get some kills, if not i go afk. 


But let me tell you the truth: wow classic honor system is not about having a High winrate, it’s about honor pr. hour. This is how it was made! Stop flaming people for not wanting to spend 30+ min in a bg. Imagine if everybody just fought for the first flag, whoever gets it get to win.

fjhb95,Rokhiani,How to get more people to queue for low-level BG brackets,"There's an 800-post thread about the US being split into East and West-coast battlegroups, which [increases low-level queue times](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/blizzard-why-did-you-kill-off-sub-60-battlegrounds/466332).

But if you look at the stats, there [aren't that many twinks](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=30&amp;maxLevel=52&amp;minLevel=26). Most twinks are at the top of their bracket, 19, 29, 39, 49, or 59. Recorded characters in the last 30 days:

Lvl 28: 9986

Lvl 29: 10960

Lvl 30: 10682

Lvl 31: 9670

(spike for artisan professions at lvl 35)

Lvl 38: 9201

Lvl 39: 9928

Lvl 40: 11692

Lvl 41: 9282

Lvl 48: 7864

Lvl 49: 8340

Lvl 50: 8119

Lvl 51: 7924

Recombining US servers would double the number of people queueing for each bracket. But making BGs fun for everyone, not just twinks (people with the best gear and enchants at less than the maximum level, often supported by a main), could potentially increase the number of people queuing by 10x or more.

One way to make PvP fun for non-twinks is significant changes to the honor system that realistically will never happen. But another way is to make it so non-twinks don't penalize the team they're on with a lower chance to win, simply for not being at the top of the bracket or not having the best gear.

We've seen suggestions about how to do this before: balance the number of players on each time based on their relative power. If there are five very strong players at the front of the queue for one faction, maybe match them against 10 weak players on the other team. You can do this based on level and gear, without any kind of long-term rating system. This would also help with [complaints about premades](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/seperate-queues-for-premades-and-randoms-in-wsg-and-ab-now/132441).

I know that with the rabid no-changes mindset of this community, this is never going to happen, so I'd like get something useful from this post by asking if anyone knows of a game that does something like this? Gives teams unequal numbers, despite having plenty of players in the queue, based on player power? (Wintergrasp in WotLK could have a few buffed players vs more numerous weaker players, but that was due to different numbers of people queueing.)",48,1584345156,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fjhb95/how_to_get_more_people_to_queue_for_lowlevel_bg/,classicwow,1

Dear Blizzard,

I am subscriber, and have been for 15 years now. I play all things Blizzard, including beta testing for HOTS, OW and D3 and have been a World of Warcraft player since Vanilla! A guild mate, and fellow subscriber, was hacked today. Blizzard’s resolution was to COD his gear back to him. Since the hackers traded away all of his gold, the guild banded together to help him get the 175G needed to recover the loot that he, along with the guild, spent time and effort to earn. That doesn’t even include the 400G he already lost. Why are victims paying to retrieve gear that was stolen from them? The money and gear he lost is traceable but it seems that Blizzard is refusing to do it. As subscribers, we PAY for the game and PAY every month for this service! I believe that Blizzard should refund the money that was spent to recover this gear as well as the gold that was stolen during this hack. Players should not be penalized by the game for being hacked. That event is out of our control and is already disruptive and personally invasive.",4,1584324705,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fjd97z/hacked_a_codd_gear/,classicwow,1

fj652y,f-stop4,Premades are absolutely destroying the fabric of Battlegrounds PvP.,"I've played 5 games of AB today as a solo queue and have \*only\* gone up against premades. It is always a 5 flag cap, sub 10 minute game. I only get in with other solo players, so our comp is usually sub-par. We go up against a team that has at \*least\* 4 or 5 healers, who actually heal. There is no competition, it is completely unfun and any previous attempts at joining or creating a premade myself yield half-assed results and that comp gets stomped anyway. This system is archaic and needs to be changed. It is not fair to match premades with pugs. There needs to be a system implemented that matches premades with premades and pugs with pugs. How anyone would think otherwise is insane, or taking advantage of this feature to max honor gains because you don't want to actually try to win or be skilled. If that is the case, you must obviously not care about PvP, because you can hardly call these premade vs pug matches PvP. It's a joke. Honestly, whats the point? I really want to enjoy this game because after end game, there isn't much else to really do other than PvP, but it's a horrible experience and unfortunately has tempted me to cancel my subscription.

However I’ve done some research about pets and they’re definitely a lot more complicated in classic. The thing that stuck out to me was that to get higher ranks of certain abilities like claw and bite on a lower level pet you have to tame higher level beasts who know those abilities and use them for a bit. Is there some kind of guide that’ll point me to the most convenient beasts to tame in order to get new abilities as early as possible?

fiz0ha,niccolo_bolas,What type of resistance gear is important for future raids?,"Even before classic was launched, i found that there was no consensus on whether dps should wear fire resist gear on some fights in the starting raids. Some said only tanks need it, some said Greater Fire Protection Potion takes care of all, some suggested everyone should stack fire resist without hindering the main goal of their class and finally some even suggested listed cloth fire resist gear on leather users, just because it had fire resist.

Just recently looked up that there will be Argent Dawn quests for frost resist, so i wanted to ask what are the future uses of resistance gear in raids for each type:
* Fire: has it's marginal use on some MC fights, useful for Ragnaros, can help if your guild is just starting Onyxia raids, very important for some BWL fights, but most of the time melee need it only
* Nature: as i read you need ~15+ person with full nature res gear - going as far a sacrificing other stats just to pump up resistance? Mainly melee needs it?
* Shadow: as far as i know only 2 warlocks need it for twin emperor tanking?
* Arcane: i have not read any fight that has any mechanic, that deal must-be-mitigates arcane damage (at least in classic)
* Frost: i saw some pretty expensive Argent Dawn quests reward you with frost resist gear, but what raid role actually needs them? Or everyone needs it, maybe for Sapphiron?",5,1584265833,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fiz0ha/what_type_of_resistance_gear_is_important_for/,classicwow,1

fiynv5,newbynewtowow,"New to raiding, what to do?","  

Hello reddit,

Im am new to raiding, ive done alot of pvp during my time in vanilla and classic but never set foot in a raid, since the pvp is somewhat boring with all the premades going i like to try raiding.

Ive googled some guides and stuff but just cant find a nice helpfull guide for setting myself up so i dont cause a dump whipe.

I got a pre-raid bis frost mage with enough gold for consumables and respecs, almost got the ony attunement done, mc done, guildless for now and only got time to do maybe 2 evenings of raiding in the week, not weekends.

My questing is should i look for a PUG or find a guild to try out raiding, are the PUGs forgiving to people who never raided before or expect those PUGs u know all the tactics and positioning?I dont wanna cause whipes and stuff, i just like to come prepared and kinda get carried the first time, what is the better choice. Gear will be second priority, just wanna get good at the doing decent damage without messing it up.

I know mages are not highly sought after because there are so many of them but i dont desire a core raiding spot, is there place for in guilds for raiders who cant make every raid?

Maybe its a dump question but its new to me and i dont wanna ruin 40 peoples evening.",48,1584263516,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fiynv5/new_to_raiding_what_to_do/,classicwow,1

I had a few questions: are there still enough people to have a satisfying starting experience? what about the PVE?  
From your viewpoint, would it be more ""useful"" to play a tank or a healer? (I love playing both, but what is more needed atm?)

Considering a few weeks quarantine, is WoW classic able to provide a satisfying experience? or should I invest in retail?

FYI I first started playing during TBC era

I’m not sure about Orcs but was pretty sure there are a number of axes that would be better tank weapons, but if not it’s still marginal compared to the huge upgrade it is for a sword rogue. 

Our OT getting it first so he can essentially DW tank trash and generate higher threat is what’s really sticking in my craw... He still uses TF/shield on bosses.

Oh and us rogues were finally allowed to roll on Accuria last week. Before only warriors(fury or prot) were allowed to roll on it.

Am I wrong for thinking this is absolute lunacy?",183,1584197559,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fijisz/maladath_to_tanks_over_rogueshorde/,classicwow,1

Instead of TBC classic... chromie time community - WoW ""every old addon"" Classic","I just watched a great youtube video by soulsobreezy who explains how the level squish in shadowlands will really work. As far as my understanding goes ""chromie time"" is confirmed which means level 10-50 is a leveling bracket where all content before shadowlands scales with your character and only when you knowingly break ""chromie time"" your character is able to enter shadowlands, gain EP after lvl 50 and all old content scales down to lvl35.

This basicly means its possible to form a ""chromie time only"" community with the release of shadowlands where a whole server is dominated by players who willingly only play chromie time, basicly making this server a ""wow every old expansion at the same time classic"" with automated scaling to 50, raiding every old raid together for example, grinding a combination of old gear of different expansions which will all be ""equally endgame"" to them.

fifyj9,Decent-Riven,Alterac Valley Exalted and You: Alliance edition (Horde coming never),"So some of you might be in the same position I was until earlier tonight, having missed the bus completely on AV premades and never ended up getting exalted with the Stormpike Guard, but still want your Don Julios or caster whateverthefuck.  


Prepare for a lot of pain. But maybe I can make it a little bit better.

&amp;#x200B;

Alliance lose in AV. Almost every game. Outside of premades, I can recall a grand total of two wins. Two. In 42000 rep. One of which was the exact game I hit exalted in. That was a fun one. So what do you do? You can't get the 396 rep from Drek, you \*usually\* can't get the 125 from Galv, now what?

&amp;#x200B;

In short, turnins. The way Ally gets rep in AV is from Armor Scrap turnins, Storm Crystal turnins until you summon the druids and they die, and HKs. 1 rep per scrap turnin, 1 per storm crystal, 1 per HK.

&amp;#x200B;

You can also get Wing Commander rep but with the way AV goes and why Ally lose - we'll get there - it's difficult. Release the 3 WCs and hope they make it back, turn in the medals for 200 extra rep per commander.

&amp;#x200B;

The big thing with turnins is getting your team on the same page. Get people to loot - make sure horde release before you click, or you won't get the items.

&amp;#x200B;

Most games, the horde will summon the Icelord. Kite him to either Spawn Cave or Vann's Room for an easy kill- spawn cave because it has respawns and NPCs to help, Vann's room also works because of Aid Station respawns and the fact that, although Vann himself won't help, the horde can't interrupt you there.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you max out Druid Storm Crystal turnins and have done a lot of armor scraps, maybe a wing commander, probably not, it's time to let the horde end the game, which they are probably close to doing. Kill the Icelord for that sweet 125 rep if possible. Then do it again. And again. And again. A good game is 500-1000 rep through turnins.

\------------------------------

So why exactly do the horde win, and win every single time without fail? There's a lot of reasons for this that have been said, and they're all true in some way.

\-The horde care more. They have longer queues and are more invested into winning.

Yeah, you're right. But it's far from the whole story.

\-PVP Racials

I mean it helps a little and is a bitch (Fuck orcs in particular), but not gamebreaking.

\-The horde communicate better

Sort of. They do seem to 'react' quicker, but this is in my eyes explained later.

\-Horde spawn WAY closer to SF than Alliance

This is a big one. The horde can, every single game, catch Ally on THEIR OWN side of SFGY ramp while they run free up the other side, leading to a very high initial take of SF by horde. The horde should spawn at RH or that back cave (Which supposedly they do in TBC but this isn't that)

\-What I see as by far the largest reason: The horde win condition is fundamentally easier to pull off than the Alliance win condition. Linearity vs complexity.

The way AV is designed makes it extremely easy to play as horde from a tactical perspective. From start to end, they have a linear progression that takes every single objective in their path to victory.

The horde spawn in the cave, and rush SFGY. Alliance can't sneak behind and ninja IBGY because of the respawns from IBGY and the closeness of the back ramp to the path to IBGY. The horde push SFGY, Alliance can fight but have to recede to SHGY. At this point, the unironically best strategy for the horde is to zug zug into SHGY until they take it, which eventually they do in almost all cases. It's very difficult for Alliance to mount and offense because we have to split our forces to SFGY. If we somehow get everyone to SF, it's an easy backcap on SHGY since we have to run all the way back past Balinda to get there, leading to people staying at SH for a weaker SF push, or more at SF leading to losing SHGY. The horde can then zerg into SF and likely take it within 5 minutes. Taking SFGY is also the best Ally win condition, but very hard to pull off for the above reasons.

The horde takes SHGY by one way or another. At this point, if they softcap and Alliance doesn't immediately recap, Ally is fucked. The horde zerg into SHGY and the deathball commences. They fan out, blocking all access to the south of the map. Unless you're stealth, there's literally no way through a horde wall at SHGY/IWB. They don't have to worry about backcaps because nobody can sneak by.

The linear progression continues down the IWB hill as the horde slowly push down the road. For whatever reason they can trap us in SHGY spawn, shoot on us from above the road, push us back to SPGY, and then ranged shoot us as we spawn from the hills above. As if it was designed to be spawntrapped. By the point horde get to SPGY or before, Ally have called it a loss. Maybe we're just used to it. We definitely are. But, we give up at some point anyway. So the horde's linear progression continues to Vann and they kill him as Ally leave. A sidenote here, it's somewhat easy, if you have decent AOE and heals, to hold the horde indefinitely at bridge by Aid Station. They zug down and get slowed by warrior shouts and mages and killed. Effective if you get it to work.

I heard it said by a friend that AV feels like it was designed by a twelve year old horde player. With the SHGY spawnpoint camp, the shooting down on SPGY and the road, the perfect choke by IWB- everything could be described as ""wouldn't it be really cool if we could \_\_\_\_.""

Good luck in AV, if by some miracle you read this far. It's gonna hurt, a lot. If you win, buy a lottery ticket. I made about 10k rep in a 14 hour session one day. Throw on a movie, or an entire saga. You'll have time.

fia9l4,TheBoisterousBoy,"So, is Classic actually worth it?","I started playing WoW back when Cata had been out for a little bit. Played through Cata till the very beginning of WoD. I stopped liking the game when it went from being a fun, questing adventure and became more of a Grindfest. It also made me really disheartened to see professions just continuously get shit on (Inscription went from being something uniquely awesome to the most bland and IMO useless profession in the game) making it less fun to try and get those little levels to try and market your stuff. 

Anyway. My question is will Classic WoW sate that burning desire to play a version of wow that has some sort of community, use for professions and a baseline of skill? What’s the player base like now that some time has gone by? Will I have fun playing it, or should I just move on from WoW entirely?",12,1584147238,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fia9l4/so_is_classic_actually_worth_it/,classicwow,1

I was wondering if there was a specific place that I could farm Runecloth for the obvious rep grind. I have been saving what I get from random humanoid mobs while questing but after doing the math I will be needing thousands of cloth so I wanted to see if anyone had a great place to farm this.

I have also been doing AV and turning in all the materials I loot which has gotten me quite a bit of rep but I definitely would prefer something quicker than the 2-3 rep per quest turn in(I can get around 500 per game if I am able to loot that much but I also have to wait an hour at a time to get into a match).

(Mathematics isn't fun). 

Anyways, I'll be having a lot of free time now, and my mom has no immune system as shes currently going through chemo, so I can't leave the house for just about any reason unless necessary and none of my friends want to rejoin. 

So basically I'm looking for people to play with, willing to start fresh as horde or alliance, or continue on Fairbanks on my priest it doesnt matter to me. Whether you are in a similar spot or want to level an alt somewhat quickly, I'm down. Looking to play like 15-25 hrs a week, and play competently when going about it. Don't have to be speedrunning it but don't want to grog through everything. I'm free just about every day after getting classwork and research work done by 4pm EST, and will stay up till 2 am EST. Again, couldn't care less to play ally or horde, and will play shaman healer if we go horde. (Not looking to level a 2nd priest if we go ally, would rather dps then go pally too). 

Not sure if this is allowed to go here, will move it to where it is allowed. Thanks and hope to see some of yall out there.",4,1584131909,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fi6ea2/starting_back_up/,classicwow,1

fi3idz,mateuscx,COVID-19 is killing Azeroth and Blizzard is taking no action!,"COVID-19, also known as chinese bot company, is killing not only humans in real life, but also games, like World of Warcraft Classic. Blizzard is getting hardcore raped by these chinese bots, they are everywhere, every single server, every single faction, farming inside dungeons, in the open world, literally everywhere. My friends and I have been hunting them and reporting for over a month now, but Blizzard doesn't seem to be worried about saving WoW Classic from COVID-19. All bots we've reported have been leveling and farming inside dungeons like Scarlet Monastery, Zul'Farrak, Sunken Temple, Uldaman, Stratholme, not to say the others that are farming in the open world, these are harder to detect. Inside dungeons 99% of them are the same company, using on Horde side a Druid, Priest and 3 Mages inside dungeons. They are 99% of the time guidless and with auto generated names, not hard to detect. They are not dumb, they are a smart and strong COVID-19, they don't walk together, they don't stay logged 24 hours a day, do many pauses during the day, always random, don't be fulled, they are bots 101%. Here are some of them (only the Druids and Priest, leaders of group, or else would be a huge list) we managed to catch on our servers inside these dungeons but Blizzard didn't do anything about it yet:

&amp;#x200B;

Incendius Horde:

Adary

Amioze

Bartan

Belik

Claint

Gehhy

Gulpen

Honawnee

Jompok

Kapers

Masill

Muhana

Readerd

Velaudela

Nomah

Nordonabas

&amp;#x200B;

Kromcrush Horde:

Yosmo

Gappla

Rikop

Vermas

Hwapo

&amp;#x200B;

Benediction Horde:

Benetry

Deferrada

Erevans

Mellynt

Mesharne

Retga

Venner

Xertah

&amp;#x200B;

Sulfuras Horde:

Amishona

Danazee

Debraiz

Hecktakiya

Rothonrichop

&amp;#x200B;

These are only the group's heads, Druids and Priest, because they are so many that reportinig them all everyday would take me way too long, so I prefer to report only the Druids and Priests and hope for the rest to be banned together, but so far no ban at all, only on Incendius Horde I am following 7 groups, so 35 bots, but they are everywhere. The only way to stop them, is to ban them before they reach Lvl 40+, or else it will already be worth for them even if they get banned, so after these high levels get banned, patrolling Scarlet Monastery is a must! Blizzard needs to take action faster, less than a week after a report or it will be too late and the COVID-19 will win the war.  


Go patrol, report them, post here the names of more bots you find on your server/faction, let's all flood blizzard with reports every single day until they do something about it!

fi2l71,Apollexis,"Unpopular Opinion: Classic WSG is way worse, and less enjoyable than Retail WSG","Just for those who don't know, here are some pretty great changes that happened to WSG on retail, that honestly would be great if they added to Classic WSG at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. ) 15 minute time limits.** 

This might seem odd, but it really makes these games less AIDS, the way it works is basically if it's a tie, the side who had capped a flag most recently would be the winner. It makes games a lot more enjoyable because you don't have to deal with long drawn out games which especially suck when people are already giving you 0 honor after repeated kills.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.) 50% Bonus honor for people defending in the flag rooms.**

 This should be easy to understand, but it's really nice, and it actually gives an incentive to put strategy in to the game and not feel like you're being penalized.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.) Flag Bearers become more vulnerable the longer they hold the flag,** 

If you're dealing with a super turtle group, eventually the people holding the flags become extremely vulnerable and take extra damage. It's carried from person to person, it's based off who is actually holding the flag, not a specific debuff for one person and then can be swapped off. If both people are holding flags too long, they can both get the debuff.",67,1584117832,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fi2l71/unpopular_opinion_classic_wsg_is_way_worse_and/,classicwow,1

fi20ky,vortex947,Honor Grind Mentality Makes Queuing as a Prem or a Pug Boring,"The current honor grind mentality does not encourage competitive gameplay and I believe a system should be added to help match up prems with other prems and pugs with other pugs. Other than people who say “no changes” for the sake of no changes I would like to hear reasons why people disagree with such a change. I have provided my reasoning in the below why I believe this change would be beneficial for the long term health of classic wow PVP:

As it stands now, the honor grind encourages prems to win as fast as possible. Therefore, competitive prem vs prem games are not desirable as they can become drawn out and kill honor per hour, thus prems who lose the first mid fight or first cap will just lie down rather thank continue competing - this is not fun/competitive gameplay. I have joined these prems seeking fun gameplay and this is what I’ve found for the most part. The fun part about playing a prem is competing against another highly organized prem in a hotly contested match, not keeling over at the first sign of adversity and hoping to get a pug next game. So the people who say “just join a prem” are not justified as this scene is just as, if not even more boring, than the pug scene.

On the flip side, prems do find it desirable to fight pugs as the honor per hour is very high. However,  obviously, prem vs pug is the least competitive/least fun outcome. I would hope that we can agree that gameplay which results in one team afking in another team’s GY while the other team afks in ghost form should be avoided if possible. 

With the above said, a system which places prems against other prems means that premades will no longer be able to rely on getting quick wins/losses against other prems so they can quickly get to the next game to crush a pug. They will need to actually be able to beat other prems. They will actually need to compete with one another in order to get wins and gain honor. They can’t just be mindless mongoloids farming pugs and still get rewarded. This will serve to create a truly healthy competitive scene for prems as the good prems will still get good honor per hour and the bad prems won’t and may either need to find better people to prem with or switch to pug queue. 

Also, the pug scene will obviously reap the benefits of mostly being paired against pugs, creating fun games for pug players as well and even make grinding honor as a pug more palatable.

I’m not saying I have the answer to exactly what system needs to be implemented to achieve the above, but don’t think the system even needs to be perfect. There just needs to be something implemented to help steer prems to fight other prems and pugs fight other pugs. My overall point is that a state in which things are now is terrible and to get even partially to a point in which prems are actually competing against other prems(not just taking quick wins or losses) and pugs are actually competing against other pugs(not just getting mindlessly stomped) should be the desired state of play.",12,1584115702,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fi20ky/honor_grind_mentality_makes_queuing_as_a_prem_or/,classicwow,1

fi1ror,Oglethorppe,TBC’s content nerfs: Is there a record and should they be repeated?,"Scouring through the patch notes, it’s difficult to find any real hard numbers on the content nerfs that took place during its lifespan. So first I’d like to ask if anybody knows a more solid database for digging through this stuff. 

Secondly, do you think these content nerfs should be repeated? It’s very likely that BC releases with the finalized patch balance, 2.4.3. While I think the class design may be set in stone, I don’t think the nerfs need to be. Back in 2007-2008, they nerfed content to give people more to be able to do, before more content would come out. 

The difference is that this time, in the 2020s, many people aren’t looking to speed through the content. I’d imagine many BC players would even stay and work through the unifinished content long after Wrath’s relaunch. This is why I think any nerfs, beyond a few minor ones in extreme cases, should be set aside, so we can experience the game as it was made. It would suck to get BC, and it’s either nerfed to hell from day one, or have it be glorious and hard, only to be permanently nerfed from that point onward.",110,1584114774,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fi1ror/tbcs_content_nerfs_is_there_a_record_and_should/,classicwow,1

A quick glance at the auction house looked like most leather types and hides weren't selling for too much, and a lot of guides I saw just recommend vendoring leather/hide stacks, although that may have just been for release since nobody had the money at that point to buy stuff up off the AH.

Is there any reason to stock up on leather and/or hides for future phases? Should I try my luck on the auction house with this stuff, or should I just vendor it? I mostly have rugged leather, thick hides, cured medium and heavy hides.

- replace toughness with a threat generation increase, also 5 talent point max, and damage from totems generates threat for the caster
- link that talent with a 1 talent point max talent (possibly merged with guardian totems’ effect) 2 rows down: “While a shield is equipped, stoneskin totem also increases the caster’s armor contribution from items by 80%”


No dps would want extra threat generation and shield requirement just for the extra armour. Exact values would be chosen as to roughly balance it with prot paladin.

fhysb5,Malusch,Swapping skinning for alchemy?,"I have 315 skinning and do MC, Ony, &amp; BWL every week. Core leather and onyxia scales are still reserved for our guild bank, so a majority of the money I make from skinning comes from being lucky and getting Black dragon scales in BWL (two other 315 skinners in the main raid group so I don't get all skins).

On my server other leathers has recently gone up a lot in price. Thick leather 15s instead of 5-8s, rugged leather 25-30s instead of previous 10s. Don't always have time to play a lot so while those are a nice little bonus every now then on average it's most likely less than 15g/week (plus another 10-30g from bwl every week).

Thinking about dropping skinning for alchemy. Is that better, gold wise, in regards to my limited play time? Any other prof that would be even better? I'm a mage btw if that matters.

fhxm0y,Esarus,[Bug] Arcane Missiles not working as it did in Vanilla,"Hi everyone,  


I hope this will reach Blizzard in some shape or form. I will post on the official forums as well and will submit in-game bug reports.  


To keep it short, Arcane Missiles (the Mage spell in the Arcane school) does not work the same as it did in Vanilla:  


1. It cancels when your target moves out of range after the channel has started
2. It cancels when your target moves out of line of sight after the channel has started

Both these two points were different in Vanilla, and it made a high mana, low damage spell actually worth using (mostly in PvP). It definitely saw use because of this in Arena in TBC as well.   


So in Vanilla and TBC, the spell would keep on going and finish its channeling duration, as long as the spell was activated with the target in range and in line of sight.  


Would be amazing if Blizzard could return Arcane Missiles to the same functionality as in Vanilla.

What do you guys think about this? I know the topic is discussed here a lot but if the problem isn't stressed, it'll never get addressed.

I'm currently level 18 with no talents spent yet. I want to tank in dungeons, starting from the Deadmines. Now, I learned the most common distribution for tanks is most of the points in Protection, and some in Holy, mostly for the Consecration skill. I can find a lot of guides and builds online, but none seem to specify wether to invest in Protection or Holy first.

What would be more important? Getting Consecration as soon as possible, with the disadvantage of delaying the unlocking of abilities such as Holy Shield, Improved Righteous Fury and other tanking skills? Or should I be aiming to get those abilities first, and only start investing in Holy after spending my points in Protection first?",12,1584087997,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fhwefm/paladin_tank_early_dungeon_tanking_talents/,classicwow,1

So to start off i'm at work and unable to provide screenshots of my claims, will look into editing this post with screenshots (No phone) as I come home.

Right so i'm the MT of the guild and with AB releasing and no raid until Sunday I decided to buy TUF and go wreck some faces. Sure, some faces were wrecked but it was mine a majority of the time.

I was proper frustrated that this one dwarfpriest seemed to have stacked more dodge than rogues dodging an MS and 3 auto's in a row. Then I saw some yellow misses which confused me, but I chalked it up to insect swarm,I'd kept an eye on my combat log and not a single special had been listed as a miss. Then I charge 4 people, get a sweeping strikes whirlwind off which hit 1 person and missed on the other 3, eyes to debuffs only thing I've got on me is deep wounds hamstring CoA and corruption. Combat log only showed the 1 hit, not all my misses.

Might gloves, Don Julios, Blackstone Ring, Rune of the Guard Captain, Satyr Bow, Onyxia Pendant are the hit pieces I used yesterday putting me 1% above the PvP hitcap. My two-handed mace skill is 1/300 however and is the only thing that makes sense causing this.

With the weekend event, every cap is giving an extra 10 rep, for 45 reputation per flag capture. However, you are no longer receiving the end-of-game bonus. So now, we are getting 135 reputation per win and 0 reputation for a loss. 

Was looking forward to the rep bonuses this weekend to push the last bit of the way to exalted.

For some fun stats, if you wanted to go to 0 rep to exalted and you could only scrape by on losses during WSG call to arms, you would need to do 2520 games total, almost 1000 more games than when you received 10 reputation for a loss.",11,1584068257,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fhswg6/wsg_weekend_killing_endofgame_reputation_bonuses/,classicwow,1
fhskat,Schmitty777,tHe oLd FaShIoNeD wAY,"Incoming rant below.

I love classic WoW, it's given me a chance to experience everything I missed coming late to the game many years ago. The mobs are harder to kill, the quests are brutal sometimes, and money is sparse, I love it. It takes time to level up, time to get from point A to B, and time to get money. What shouldn't take time is getting in touch with people to adventure TOGETHER. 

This rant stems from the fact that I just spent the last three hours chatting up looking for group and local to find a group for SM graveyard. The problem comes from LFG channel being spammed with guild recruitment and people wanting to buy runs instead of doing it themselves. There are a few people looking for groups, but time is limited and waiting for more than 15 minutes causes people to leave the group. 

Prior to classic coming out people wanted a group finder, I, like many other, said nay, the community will be thick with eager adventures talking and communicating to band together and brave the dungeons...fast forward to now and its no where close to that. 

Looking for group is spammed with either guild recruitment or people wanting to buy runs, that's it. I spent three hours outside SM hitting up local and LFG but no one ever replies. It was after work hours, on a nearly full server, and nothing. No one wants to wait to form a group, no one wants to ""communicate"" so they buy runs which is easier, better for loot, and faster. It makes sense people do that because finding a group ""tHe oLd FaShIoNeD wAY"" is infuriating and time wasting.

So adding a LFG system instead of just a chat wouldn't change anything because the ""system"" is already not working as intended. Why people are so fixated on keeping this the same confuses me, it sucks, it not enjoyable, and doesn't create anymore of a community than a LFG finder would.

Because this virus is airborne, nobody has immunity to it, we can assume the spread in a public area would be similar to the corrupted blood incident of the past (though maybe with a lower fatality rate).

Have one area of the game with a raid of healers who's sole job is to spam heal players who come to the area with the disease. This would do a good job to showcase how limited resources would affect death rates when a large population is all trying to seek help at the same time.

I doubt this would happen unless it was organized by a server, but would be cool if we could convince blizzard to let a server make a video on this experiment. You know.. For science.",14,1584059921,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fhqxjm/currupted_corona_blood_event/,classicwow,1

This is why they should give away 2 free months of wow and wow classic to “encourage safety during the Corona Virus outbreak.” Pornhub already did this in Italy and everyone gave them a big thumbs up after thoroughly washing their hands (hopefully.)

2, I use Dal rend as MH and Maladath as OH.

Despite Maladath having faster speed, the much higher dps on it along with ""AP normalization"" (something I recently learned about), Maladath + Mirah Song will result in higher sinister strike damage, and higher overall dps.

fhk1xp,JaggTank,Can we stop with the f'ing turtles plx,"This seems to be a new trend in every BG (AV, WSG, AB) where every game is turning into a turtle, by that I mean that you have 2 roughly evenly matched teams, that are both focusing on defending objectives, but this means they have no offense. 

I just afk'ed out of a 35 min game, where horde capped no forward objectives, they tapped SH a few times but lost it. Alliance tapped IB GY a few times and got zerged down, and about 35 minutes in, horde had 700 bonus honor, ally had 700 bonus honor and the kills hit diminishing returns. 

This is when alliance gets the /afk moves, and horde doubles-down on turtling. Every alliance ranker knows that this game will go on for another 30+ minutes, it will require spawning the lok or Ivus, and using it to push through the zerg, but since you have 200+ hk in the first 30 mins, you no longer get honor from kills. Since both groups pushed and killed a few LTs and got a tower, it also means that you have maybe 700 honor left on the table if you're lucky... for 30 mins. 

Every second spent in this game, means you lose honor compared to your own faction, who you compete with for ranks. Now this isn't about wins or losses, I'll take a 100% loss rate in 12 minute games vs. Russian zergers over, 50 minute+ games, where both sides suck to much to make progress. 

A) It gets boring to cap IB GY, SF GY, SH GY, etc for 2.5 minutes, then start over. 

B) There is no honor it. 

C) It's not fun to wipe them, then they wipe us, then we wipe them, then they wipe us. It gets repetitive and dull. 

""Defending"" is different than turtling. Defending means protecting objectives, in order to secure an advantage for yourself. For instance alliance defending SH GY until we have SF or IB, horde defending IB until they have SF or SH. 

Turtling is doing dumb shit, that ensures progress cannot by made, usually by either side. This can be an alliance that recaps SH GY from horde, when horde doesn't have a northern GY, meaning that they all spawn down south and go defensive-zug. 

It can mean the 5 - 10 horde who head south to wipe alliance at IB GY, and thus send them to aid station or cave so they end up adding 5 - 10 defenders at Dun Baldar. 

Defenders slow down the other team to enable their other team to accomplish something. 

Turtlers slow down the other team and hurt their own team by doing dumb shit, like getting more of the other team to defend.

Typically don't have too many issues finding a few people to come. Well, this particular day I did. And I get it, I'm reserving 2 highly popular items and not all caster classes are going to want to come when they know that if their belt or ring drops off Ogre in arena, they have to compete with the others. So anyway, I lift the Res on SGC thinking ""Meh, this shit never drops anyway..""

I couldn't have mistaken myself more...

As soon as I lifted the Res, I got a hunter whisper. Cool, whatever, I'll take it. I get this bad feeling about inviting him, but then I tell myself that it's just myself being Greedy and I need to be more fair. The group has been waiting patiently long enough, let's just get this thing going.

We get there, get to arena.. first run, Gorosh comes out. I'm like ""Oh no.. don't do this to me""... Sure enough, SGC dropped.

Guess who lost? Hunter said he felt bad but he only came for that. So, I technically couldn't be mad at him, because he won fair and square, but Fuck I was frustrated for a hot minute...

Found a group relatively quickly who was fine with me Reserving both SGC and HOJ. Had a holy paladin in my group, who said he could use for OS, but after hearing my shit luck he felt really bad and would let me have it if it dropped. 

Now I shit you not, the Very first run going back into BRD.... HOJ dropped off Anger, and I got it. So my spirits are up, group was all congratulatory for me, and I'm a lot happier. Almost completely forgot about the SGC thing a couple days ago. I'm thinking that I'm just gonna call it here, and be done with BRD- figuring that the trinket was most important for me and that SGC wasn't that high of value, worth spending all this later time to get. We went and did Flamelash by request of a group member, sure, I was happy, why not? So then they say ""Let's do just 1 more run?"" I'm like Yeah cool, I'm game.

We get to arena... Gorosh comes out again (we hadn't come out that first run, but he had just popped out and dropped SGC 2 runs ago, the other day). Again, I'm like ""....Nah.... you, you ain't gonna drop it duuude""

. . . SGC drops

I'm fucking ecstatic. I got it.

The WoW gods surely pitied me this day.

TL;DR: 2x SGCs in 3 runs, including a HOJ off Anger. I got both these pieces back to back runs. For anyone curious, yeah I had a bad experience with the first SGC... but this all happened to me in a little under 50'ish runs.

... Unbelievable luck.",53,1584029704,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fhit5z/i_got_sgc_in_a_little_under_50ish_runs_after/,classicwow,1

fhhu6m,Benton0329,My 2 cents on the impact of the BG/Battlegroup change on Tuesday for low level brackets.,"I spend quite a bit of time on the WoW: Classic reddit and I felt that I'd throw my opinion out to see if it might help spark some constructive discussion on the issue.

There is a line in the sand, as far as reddit goes, between two types of opinions on the issue in the title.

1. The people who are creating posts complaining about how this change has affected lower bracket pvp queue times. The majority of these people have twinks in various brackets, but some just enjoy pvping on alts while leveling.
2. The people replying to these posts that do not have a ""pony in this race"", if you will, and were not really affected by what this change means for people who enjoyed something that was basically removed, without warning, overnight.

Here's what I think. Twinking has always been a hot point of discussion in WoW, with a constant battle between those who like it, and those who think it's borderline exploitation. However, it was always a part of Vanilla, always. People play this game for many reasons - some enjoy Raiding, Ranking, RP, questing, fishing... the list can go on and on. Some people play the game to twink in low brackets.

From what I've read, as I do not have a twink myself (although I was considering a 49 warrior prior to this change since casual level 60  pvp is so scuffed right now), these low level brackets have been affected to the point of being unplayable due to queue times. 

This change is not limited to the small group of players that twink, and have enough invested to take the time to write a post complaining on reddit. This is affecting the entire leveling experience for any player who might want to pvp during the leveling process, and might now never have the chance due to ridiculous queue times. 

Let us not forget that prior to the 'dungeon cleave/world first' meta, the leveling experience was an entire aspect of the WoW experience for most players. Even streamers who burnt themselves out on the way to 60 say they regret not taking the time to enjoy the different aspects of WoW while leveling. The fact is that the majority of new players leveling the game are now affected by a lazy solution to a problem that didn't even exist a few days ago implemented by Activision/Blizzard.

I also understand that battlegroups were a part of the game. This is a fair point, and probably the only valid point of those who are on board with the recent change. I can also understand that communities were built within these low brackets prior to the east/west split, which have now been crushed under the change. 

In conclusion, try to think about people who enjoy this game for different reasons than yourself. Empathy is something that hasn't existed in the online world for some time now, but it should. Try to keep that in mind before you post your comment.

With that being said I’m considering going disc for PI, phat power word shields, significantly larger mana pool and all that jazz. Yes, i’d lose out on some of my +healing but I feel It could be a better supporting role, continue using the same down ranked heals in raids while reducing my over-healing.

What are your raid groups looking like for priests?

fhhbdt,spanquebank,Mouseover Macro Cleanup Question,"Hi r/classicwow.

I'm salty as hell because I died trying to clear a large pack of EPL mobs while I had the lotus spawn on me. I use a mouseover macro for all of my heals as a shaman and most of my macros begin with /cast \[@mouseover, exists\]. For example:

  
\#showtooltip  
/cast \[target=mouseover, exists\] Lesser Healing Wave; Lesser Healing Wave

Normally, this heals a mouseover target when it exists or myself when I don't have a mouseover. When I was in close proximity to the Noxious Glade EPL Lotus spawn, I had one mob left to go and just enough mana to get it done, provided I could get a heal off. I healed a god damn totem because my camera was close-up and thats what my mouse was on, and that's when I had to watch a mage come by and poly the last mob to get the flower. Is there a ""nototem"" or ""target=player"" function that can prevent my totems from counting as mouseover targets.

fhh5g3,SopeADope,Recent regional change to BGs was poorly implemented,"I hate whining about great games and one that provides so much playability for only 15 a month... but... I have to vent. Blizzards recent decision to split the Americas to East and West for BGs is a highly negative and is very impactful to my game play. What makes it so frustrating is it was a completely unnecessary and a lazy solution to a problem they will have with the xp weekends. Since Tuesday, I have not been able to do a single WSG from 5-7am in the 30-39 bracket and even though AB was released just yesterday... no games were available at all today up to 6:30am on the west coast. 
I have 2 kids and a wife that enjoys time together, that makes playing in prime hours nearly impossible most days. 
I know I could do a few things to find a solution like move to an east coast server or play in the higher level brackets but 1) this wasn’t an issue until Tuesday... it’s a problem they created. 2) it costs money to move servers plus 3) I have multiple characters from 38-60 and play with friends and making a coordinated move very challenging.
I just want to play a character slowly to 60 doing some ranking in none 60 pvp but now it would appear that is out of the question. The beauty of this game is the journey to 60, why eliminate pvp from it for many folks in my position. IMHO they need to figure out a new solution.

Im am new to raiding, ive done alot of pvp during my time in vanilla and classic but never set foot in a raid, since the pvp is somewhat boring with all the premades going i like to try raiding.

Ive googled some guides and stuff but just cant find a nice helpfull guide for setting myself up so i dont cause a dump whipe.

I got a pre-raid bis frost mage with enough gold for consumables and respecs, almost got the ony attunement done, mc done, guildless for now and only got time to do maybe 2 evenings of raiding in the week, not weekends.

My questing is should i look for a PUG or find a guild to try out raiding, are the PUGs forgiving to people who never raided before or expect those PUGs u know all the tactics and positioning?I dont wanna cause whipes and stuff, i just like to come prepared and kinda get carried the first time, what is the better choice. Gear will be second priority, just wanna get good at the doing decent damage without messing it up. 

I know mages are not highly sought after because there are so many of them but i dont desire a core raiding spot, is there place for in guilds for raiders who cant make every raid? 

Maybe its a dump question but its new to me and i dont wanna ruin 40 people evening.",0,1584004213,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fhdhvh/first_time_raiding_pug_or_guild/,classicwow,1

fhd4dt,HoiFan,Tank warrior rotation / ability question,"hi,

I just wanted to know how you tank in dungeons vs mob groups compared to my own roation. Maybe I can alter my rota/buttons with your help.

These are my buttons for battle-stance:

(big cooldown spells like shield wall are on a different bar)

1. Charge
2. Thunder Clap
3. Def Stance
4. Mocking Blow
5. Shoot

These are my buttons for def stance:

1. Sunder Armor
2. Shield Block
3. Revenge
4. Battle Stance
5. Demo Shout
6. Battle Shout
7. Blood Rage

I'm also interested in reducing my action bar in def stance, since I dont like to use that many abilties. Maybe there are macros I could use.

This is my typical rota vs mob groups: (4 mobs)

1. Charge

2. Def Stance

3. Demo Shout

4. Battle Shout

5. Sunder Armor / Shield Block / Revenge --&gt; I use the ability, that is free at the moment

fhcr5x,Venomisto,"A new world buffs addon with personal warning timers before they come off cooldown, guild chat warnings, server wide sync, and more. Makes it very easy to get world buffs.","Hi here's a new world buffs addon with a bunch of features I wanted for myself but couldn't find in the other options out there. It gives you pre warnings before they come off cooldown and a bunch of other stuff so the drop is never a surprise. It's very reliable at getting timer data and spreading it around so you basically always have timers. I hope you find it useful.

[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nova-world-buffs](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nova-world-buffs)

 

**What it does**  
Warning msgs in chat window, middle of the screen, and guild chat.  
Warnings for each channel and time left can be turned on and off with /wb config.  
Current warning times are 30/15/10/5/1 minutes left until buff reset.  
Guild msgs are configured so only 1 person online at a time will send warning msgs to avoid spam.  
Guild  chat is notified and timer reset if a buff NPC is killed infront of a  member with the addon installed (mind control reset).  
Any guild member can type !wb in guild chat to display all timers.  
Display timers to yourself by typing /wb.  
Display timers to any channel by typing /wb &lt;channelname&gt; Examples: /wb party /wb say /wb trade.  
Display timers automatically when you log on.

**Data Syncing**  
Syncs to guild at logon and when another player logs on.  
Syncs when joining a group to everyone in the group.  
Syncs server wide between addon users that meet each other in the world and then syncs that info with your guild.  
Syncs to ""yell"" at logon and when changing zones (so hearthing/portals etc to crowded areas will sync to all there).  
Syncs to ""yell"" periodically to spread data around the server.  
For  more reliability this addon also checks other world buff addon  communications to get timers if guild members have them installed.

**Please type /wb config after  installing this addon and choose what timer messages you want to  receive, you may find it too spammy with the default settings.**",111,1583999129,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fhcr5x/a_new_world_buffs_addon_with_personal_warning/,classicwow,1

fhbbfp,smokin_barrelz,Rogue spec opinion!,"So I'm torn on my dagger rogue spec. I have been combat daggers for raiding and in pvp.  It was...eh for pvp but now, especially in BWL, combat dagger dps is lookin good. However, I really like seal fate since it gives me some more pvp viability but also, from looking at guides/other rogue posts, seems to be a competative PvE spec at 30% crit. Currently Im at an unbuffed 33% crit, with full raid buffs I hit between 39% and 40% crit with combat daggers. If I was seal fate daggers fully PvE buffed I'd be like 34%/35% crit which is 4%/5% over the ""minimum"" of the 30% I keep seeing people say about seal fate PvE. 

Do you think my DPS will significantly drop in PvE by swapping over to seal fate? Or with my crit% where it is will my seal fate DPS compete with my combat spec DPS? I just dont wanna change and lose a ton of DPS if the ""30% crit"" for seal fate PvE is inaccurate?

fhatbq,BitterHumor0,Parses make me feel bad.,"This is a silly topic honestly, but every week I get my world buffs and try to parse a bit better then the last..

I’ve always felt confident in my skills as a player; not the best but extremely versatile as a player. Quick to deal with problems and so forth.. I like to tank but couldn’t find a spot after my guild collapsed so I fell into DPS’ing

Whenever I played a damage role in WoW I really didn’t enjoy it. Thinking back to the last time I played retail was a Frost Mage in Highmaul - I spent hours trying to get the rotations down and just couldn’t. I’d have a guy next to me in the same gear and spec doing 30% more damage..

So anyway, I fell into the role of DPS again and looking at my parses I try and improve a little each week. Even when i’m performing at my “best” i’m pulling 55-60 parses, occasionally i’ll get a 90-95 and nothing about that fight felt different.

I turned off my DPS meters and focus on rotation / positioning and correct play, do everything in my power to perform better. Still rocking the same 60ish parses.

I really wouldn’t mind, but it actually feels bad knowing no matter how hard i’m going for it I can’t perform better. It concerns me that my guild may treat me as dead weight.

I’ve been a gamer my whole life; got into competitive esports at a few points and have reached top 1% in the world for Halo 3 and Overwatch. So it kind of bruises the ego that I can’t get a rotations down in a simple game i’ve played for over a decade.

15 years ago I had dream! Of obtaining this sexy hunk of purple pixels for my hunter back then. After months and months of many Nefarian kills, our guild seemed to be unlucky on the droprate. BUT one day it finally happened, as a frontrunner on DKP this item could finally be mine! Ready to spend the DKP that has been piling up in our little spreadsheets! But there was a warrior who has always been a great guy, so of course I passed it to him for his PVP adventures, thinking it would perhaps drop again... More months went by, we had multiple raids on farm, of course more juicy items were available by now, but this game was more than just about stat whoring, it was about making your dreams come true!

Unfortunately mine was never fulfilled and we were in TBC / WOTLK by now. :'(

After all these years, even sooner than I expected! My life is finally complete and I guess I am now ready to die! :D So special thanks to my &lt;Homeboys&gt; on Razorgore-EU for believing in me(mes) and making my little hunter dream come true! &lt;3

https://preview.redd.it/r5trkzhko4m41.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e342beee5227f1f6874c1f4ef6aa6996c4cecd57

Hey guys, Sixx here. I’ve always loved theorycrafting and just pushing the boundaries of whatever meta has been set. For Classic Hunter, the meta was set 15 years ago and even the private server scene did not shake it up. Does that mean it stood the test of time?

When you think of a Hunter in WoW- what comes to mind? Is it a ranger who shoots from afar while keeping it’s distance? Or someone in your face swinging a big sword, axe or polearm at you? I’d assume all of you would say the ranger sounds more fitting, right? Classic WoW is heavily favored towards melee though, as you may have noticed. There’s over 700 AP (930 Ally) from buffs that is exclusively melee AP only, not to mention a massive buff on the Horde side with Windfury! How could you benefit from all of this if you spent all your time ranged? A fairly new concept was introduced a few years ago by a Hunter named Timecop (to my knowledge he was the first). This concept is called melee weaving.

[https://youtu.be/A7M26j3twDU](https://youtu.be/A7M26j3twDU)

# So what is melee weaving?

Melee weaving is the act of weaving in a melee hit into your normal playstyle, whether it’s a DPS rotation, leveling/grinding mobs, PvP etc. This works because your ranged shot timer and melee swing timer are on separate cooldowns. For PvE specifically it’s fitting a Raptor Strike into your DPS rotation. During your normal non-hasted rotation you have 3 Auto Shots, 2 of which are the full duration of your attack speed and one half a second following Aimed Shot. You only use one Multi-Shot between the Aimed Shot casts so you end up with one flex spot between Auto Shots that you can do other things if needed. For weaving, that’s running in and hitting with Raptor Strike. Generally this takes between 2.4 - 3 seconds depending on your movement speed to travel the necessary 6 yards (yes, dead zone is 5-11 not 5-8 like the tooltips suggest).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xiwtfzpoo4m41.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=646ee6b7f03fc21a17adc5373adef93a324a7414

The idea behind doing this is that you are essentially adding an extra hit that does **more** damage than Auto Shots for a minimal delay in rotation timing. This means that when done properly (and you really really have to mess up to lose damage) you can boost your dps by 10-20%! A common misconception is that some fights aren’t worth it to weave however it’s often overlooked the fact that even just getting 1 melee hit in, is adding damage. A lot of people weave and they don’t even realize it! This playstyle looks at it more objectively to play more to the strengths of what you’re given and utilize that damage more than just once.

fh4ffw,Scotho,The value of Spell Crit for Paladins,"Hey all,

After hearing a lot of back and forth regarding the value of spell crit for paladins I decided i'd do a bit of my own math to determine how much effective +healing 1% spell crit gives a paladin at 800 +healing when spamming max rank FoL. By my scuffed calculations **1% spell crit appears to be worth roughly 17hp per spell crit.**

* Flash of light recieves ~43% +healing on each cast (1.5s cast time / 3.5s +healing coefficient)
* Rank 6 FoL baseline range: 376-420
* Rank 6 FoL range With +800 healing factored in: (376 + (800 * .43)) + (420 + (800 * .43)) = 726-764 range
* Rank 6 FoL range with BoL on target (gives 115hp to r6 FoL): (726 + 115) - (764 + 115) = 841 - 879 range
* 1% crit = 1.5* healing done on a FoL
* 100 FoL Casts with 0% crit = 84,100 - 87,900 healing done = (84100 + 87900) / 2 = 86000 avg healing done
* 100 FoL casts with 1% crit = ((99 * 841) + (841 * 1.5)) - ((99 * 879) + (879 * 1.5)) = 84,520.5 - 88,339.5 healing done = (84520.5 + 88339.5) / 2 = 86430 avg healing done

Now need to figure out how much +healing it takes to achieve 86430+healing without spell crit by solving for X (props to wolfram alpha so I didn't have to solve this manually)
  
&gt; (((376 + (X * .43) + 115) + (420 + (X * .43) + 115)) / 2) * 100 = 86430

X= 816.977

Robes of the exalted have 68hp + 5 int (5/54 (amount of int required for 1% spell crit) * 17 = 1.6hp) = 69.6hp

RoVP has 23 hp + 2% spell crit (or 34hp) + 15 int ( (15/54 (amount of int required for 1% spell crit)  * 16.977 = 4.75hp)= 61.75p
 
Implications: 

* Insightful hood should be considered over t2 pally helm considering the raw healing gain via spell crit
* Interestingly enough if you're going for maximum hps (assuming my math is correct) and only spamming max rank FoL/don't care about mana gen from crits, robes of the exalted should actually be a slight hps increase (like, +8hp roughly) over RoVP up until paladins hit ~875-900hp at which time becomes better for both raw throughput, mana gen, and ofcourse the juicy +10 stam it comes with.",44,1583960930,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fh4ffw/the_value_of_spell_crit_for_paladins/,classicwow,2

For me, reporting someone without evidence is worth nothing. (Already posted in Blizzard forum but instant closed)

This is why I decided to make this post on the forum with a video to be able to report a player by his name:  ""Suprmeleader-Golemagg"".

Concretely, a bot in Alterac is quite easy to detect:

\-If the bot doesn't focus, then it doesn't attack.

\-Once the bot dies, it instantly resuscitates if it has not died recently and finally

\-A bot will not move when it attacks, it will stay.

&amp;#x200B;

I can also add that a bot uses a path-finding system that will give it a very jerky movement during turns.

I hope Blizzard can make the right decision.

fh2f35,Tomthebom2010,Aspiring Druid Tank.,"About to hit 60 on my druid and I have aspirations to tank endgame content. I am a pretty casual player and have only ever raided a handful of times as a hunter back in the WoTLK days. I like to think I’m above average at the game and I had no problem tanking 5 mans while leveling. I know it takes a lot of time and commitment to be competitive as a DPS and Tank as a feral Druid with MCP and consumables so Let’s assume I have farmed MCP and have the consumable I need. That being said

I just have a few questions. 
1) How difficult is it to tank/off tank as feral?
2) Are guilds even open to accepting first time feral tanks/OT in raids? 
3) If I don’t farm MCPs, am I just awful at both tanking and DPS as feral?
4) If tanking isnt accepted as a feral, do guilds accept feral DPS Druids? Or am I going to eventually just be resto?

fgy2va,humancheese1,"Classic Server Population Control Issues. It's not a meme, but I'd appreciate the visibility and discussion.","Really @ Blizzard, but would love to create an open dialogue with the community as the issues below likely aren't going away anytime soon.

I’ll preface this long winded post by saying that I’ve mostly enjoyed my time with Classic since launch. I didn’t have any real expectations going in other than experiencing original content at level even if it was post-nerf and based off of the last patch in Vanilla. The idea of engaging in large scale open world PVP was also extremely lucrative. For the most part, those expectations were met. However temporary they may have been. To add to this, I’ve forged many friendships with people on Incendius-US that will likely carry over to other games in the future.

That said…..

I urge you, Blizzard folks, to look at the current state of Incendius  (and other high pop realms) as what had once been a very great experience in Classic WoW is quickly degrading on account of your current business model and approach to population control.

Now, I’m very glad that we are thriving and very much alive in terms of population. I’m happy to have players that transferred to Incendius in order to improve their overall experience with Classic WoW. To an extent, staying power is staying power and my days of wanting to play on a server with outlandish Horde/Ally ratios are long gone. I don’t blame them for wanting to transfer to a more balanced server.

My question is, why is Classic being treated differently in terms of realm transfers than it had in retail in the past? Is it because you don’t care? Are you strategically trying to double dip on paid transfers to and from high pop realms? With Incendius listed as a “full server,” why are paid transfers still an option and the realm not locked?

In the past in retail, free transfers were opened for high population realms in order to balance out numbers. In addition, faction specific transfers were also sometimes offered in order to try and balance the horde/ally ratio on either the high pop server or the targeted realm. You only KIND OF tried this with offering free transfers shortly after launch, but were lazy as hell and created a ton of new realms resulting in an entirely different set of problems.

Herein lie the problems:

Your initial strategy to address long launch queues was to open up free realm transfers to newly created realms. Many moved, but some also stopped playing altogether. Many of those people who took the free realm transfers are now stuck on realms with very small populations. The staying power simply won’t be there. I say small population here in comparison to say Whitemane, Incendius, or Herod.

Those of us that stayed through the initial launch queue woes on Incendius experienced several months of either no queue or a very insignificant wait and what felt like incredibly balanced faction ratios. However, as time has gone by and you have failed to control the population, Incendius is now experiencing queue times almost every day of the week and alliance transfers are starting to affect the faction balance. 

These aren’t initial launch queue times that we’re talking about here. These are queue times that you, Blizzard, have now created and allowed to happen on account of either your haphazard approach to population control or strategically double dipping on paid server transfers to and from the high population realms. Can there really even be a grey area in between? What other rationale can you provide to explain what is going on here?

Numbers don’t lie. 1+ hour queues every night of the week during peak time is not fun. Those days should be behind us by now. Hell, you can’t even get in game without a sniff of a queue on a Sunday evening. That’s saying something.

[https://ironforge.pro/servers/?filter=true&amp;server=us](https://ironforge.pro/servers/?filter=true&amp;server=us) 

[https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4698\_Incendius](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4698_Incendius)

Population is increasing exponentially again and the faction balance is shifting. Heck, even the above resources are just swatches of data based on player collection. I’m sure Blizzard's numbers are even more telling.

If you want Classic to see TBC or Classic plus with a strong player base, better start looking at proper population control or increasing revenue through means other than server transfers.

I guarantee you most of the people on the high pop realms won’t have the staying power to trudge through hour long queues forever. Even if you are expediting the phase release timelines. Similarly, those on low pop realms won’t have the staying power because of a lack of a player base. They’ll either quit all together or further compound the high population server problems by transferring or rerolling.

Do something about it.

Please.

In the meantime, please consider running running the Census Plus Classic Addon and contributing to [Ironforge.pro](https://Ironforge.pro) and the Wowclassicpopulation projects.

fgu4hw,TorlakWar,Help on fastest way to grind AB &amp; WSG Reputation,"Hello everybody,

I need your help to validate my estimations and calculations about the fastet way to get exalted with AB and WSG, as a Horde PU on EU (FR) realms. I don't care about honor, I justs want to get the reputation.

Here are my hypothesis:

**1. Alterac**

* 1.1. Time estimated = 60min avg (queue + game) 
* 1.2. Win Rate = 50% =&gt; 2 marks / hour

**2. Warsong**

* 2.1 Time estimated  = 20 min avg (queue + game)
* 2.2. Win Rate = 20% =&gt; 4.2 marks / hour (I hope lots of premade are going to AB)

**3. Arathi**

* 3.1. Time estimated = 15min avg (queue + game)
* 3.2. Win Rate = 10% =&gt; 4.8 marks / hour (I expected a lot of premade so a lot of loss)

Then I will have two options to up my reputations:

**Option A. Spam only WSG and AB** (50 rep for 3 marks of one BG)

* A.1. For WSG it will get me (50/3\*4.2) =  70 rep/hr. Considering the WSG weekends (4 days out of 30, lets say 15% bonus) =&gt; 80 rep/hour. ***=&gt;*** ***No more 10 rep if the match is lost.***
* A.2. For AB, it will get me  (50/3\*4.8) = 92 rep/hr (considering the 15% of AB weekends) + 23 rep avg/hr =&gt; 115 rep/hr
* Results =&gt; 42k reput / 80 = 525h of WSG + 42k reput / 115 = 365h of AB =&gt; **890h** to get both rep to exalted.

**Option B. Chain AV / AB / WSG for the 3 marks turn-in** (100 rep for 3 marks of each BG)

* B.1.  To get the 3 marks of each BG i will need to play 1.5h for AV / \~40min of WSG / \~40min of AB
* B.2. This is 2h50min for 100 rep of WSG and AB. *=&gt;* ***Bonus rep if 3 marks turn-in is done within the weekend ?*** 
* Results =&gt; 35 rep / hour for both AB and WSG =&gt; **1 200h** to get bot rep to exalted.

Do you see any mistakes within my reasoning ? Do you find anything that can be improved ?   
Obviously, spamming the BG is quicker to get its reputation up.

fgtpez,Spreizbacken,Exactly how important is my off hand as a rogue in PvE?,"Hey there,

I have to explain the situation a bit for it to make some sense.

As a daggers rogue (nelf) in PvE I NEED something to give me the plus weapon skill, now, the BiS list says that dagger rogues should be 5 pieces T1 and the rest T2 with the Aged Core hound gloves that give +5 dagger skill and Perd + CHT as off hand.

I am not a min maxxer and Im going for the full T2 set because... well looks honestly. It's been a dream for many years. 

I am already halfway there (4/8) and have Perds dagger but in the offhand I have distacting dagger, which gives me +6 skill points. All fine.

Now, If I had 8/8 T2 with Perds in the mainhand, should I go for the CHT in the offhand or keep the distacting dagger?  
Which would give me more DPS overall, CHT in the offhand OR +6 skill points + the dmg from the distracting dagger.

It's kind of an iffy explanation, so to those who got it - you are a smart one.",37,1583913853,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fgtpez/exactly_how_important_is_my_off_hand_as_a_rogue/,classicwow,1

fgrukw,just_one_point,Warblades of the Hakkari for Non-human Warrior,"How good are Warblades of the Hakkari for a non-human warrior who doesn't have Edgemasters?

Currently, my best weapon set is The Lobotomizer + Distracting Dagger. I don't yet have Edgemasters or Aged Core Leather Gloves, and I have an Onslaught Girdle and Lionheart Helm that I don't want to replace, so I'm pretty much stuck with Distracting Dagger until I can find another source of +weapon skill. I've been extremely unlucky with drops despite being 8/8 BWL and raiding MC + BWL + Ony weekly. 

I know that Warblades of the Hakkari would be an upgrade over what I'm using. The question is how good are they actually for a non-human?

I've been using this simulation:  [https://guybrushgit.github.io/WarriorSim/](https://guybrushgit.github.io/WarriorSim/). I'm starting to doubt its numbers. According to this thing, Warblades with my current gear (with devilsaur gloves and leggings) are within 10 DPS as good as if I had Edgemaster's, Vis'kag, and Brutality Blade, and changed no other items (hit is goes from 8% to 6%, so I'm soft-capped regardless). It doesn't seem like Warblades are actually that good, especially given the speed on the mainhand. What's going on here? Is this thing just badly wrong, or are Warblades secretly awesome?",18,1583902659,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fgrukw/warblades_of_the_hakkari_for_nonhuman_warrior/,classicwow,1

fgpx6l,SmashingQuasar,Should I stop playing?,"Hey!

Question asked a million times but I am in a difficult position.

I was an officer - and now the newly appointed GM - of the top guild of my server. I recently had a severe health condition that left me in a hospital bed for 20 days.

I am now back but my interest for the game is at raid logging level. Even then I feel like raiding isn't really that fun. We have an officer team of 5 people but every meeting is a 4 hours fight. We still achieve a lot and we have every server first so far with top speed and execution.

The problem may come from me. I just feel like not playing the game. There are a lot of reasons, but mostly it is not and will never be again the game I knew 15 years ago. It can never be.

Now the thing is, if I stop now, it is a certainty that guild will collapse and die extremely fast. I feel like all those players will most likely not find a guild that suits them since there are little hardcore guilds on this server. Also I think they will probably just stop playing as well.

I do not know what to do. Managing this guild and playing the game is a chore. I do not have the slightest fun doing so and it feels like a job.

And because the map is like a backward C for alliance, we get shafted. Where the horde map is linear and they do not encounter this problem. Horde who die at SFGY with no IBGY dont go all the way back to RH, they go to Cave or FWGY.

And it's not just a display problem, I did another WSG which we lost and stayed at 3673.

I open a support ticket and he's the response I got:

&gt;Hey there!  Game Master Droovasz here, I do hope your day is going well so far! :D  I noticed that your main is a pally, mine too! There is nothing better than knowing that you are one of the main defenders of the light and protectors of good! Man I love pallies! &lt;3  I understand that you believe you ran into a bug with your human racial bonus experience. Well that is no good, I am very sorry to hear that you did not receive the expected reputation after your BG.  It is never fun to expect to get a certain amount of rep only to not get it. This very much sounds like a bug, though not one a Game Master would be allowed, or able, to fix. To get a bug like this properly investigated, you would want to report it up through the in game bug report feature or the bug report forums. When reporting the bug, ensure you add as much details as you can to better help the QA team get to the bottom of it, and find a fix for it sooner than later. This way humans in game can get the correct reputation gains! :D  I hope you continue to enjoy your gaming experience and have a wonderful day!

I don't feel like I should have to do that when they release a patch that breaks the game. Also they should retroactively grant us back the rep.

fglksf,Gryzzyl,Settle an argument: Fang of the Faceless Priority,"I'm going to have a comment for each answer below, upvote the one you agree with. 

My buddy and I disagree on who should prio on fang of the faceless out of ZG. I'll lay out both sides:

My argument: dagger rogues prio. I think it should be used by those who benefit more -i.e. it isnt a stat stick. It's about the second best dagger so it should go to dagger rogues plain and simple. I know perds is better but it's about a 13% drop rate and not everyone has one.

My buddy: hunters and rogues share prio. His argument is that Perditions is just so much better and not THAT hard to get in comparison to other gear that rogues should just hold out until perds to get prio. He states that hunters will probably actually use Fang longer because it's not insta replaced by something already out that eventually every rogue who consistently raids should get.

Who should get prio? You decide. 

(Note: neither of us currently play a rogue and we are both geared beyond really needing anything. Just a debate.)",56,1583876206,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fglksf/settle_an_argument_fang_of_the_faceless_priority/,classicwow,1

fgku9c,Hamster_boat,"Classic WoW Redditors, We Need Your Help!","I'll keep this short. The recent announcement that east and west coast servers will be split into separate battle groups will have a strong adverse effect on lower level PvP brackets (non 60). These communities although previously reasonably healthy in size will now be split in half causing a spike in queue times across the board. The effects are already being felt. Double honor doesn't really apply to lower level brackets as most people PvP for fun and not honor. 

This change at these lower brackets is unwarranted and a big oversight by blizzard. Please help make this issue visible, so we can get this change reversed for the sake of lower bracket battle grounds and PvP.

fgktj3,beornsos,DMF 1200 tickets math?,"Hi all, so I am just getting into the dmf ticket grind (late, I know).

I am currently turning in 130 vibrant plumes, which I read about on some wowhead comments. At that point it sounds like my only two options will be the glowing scorpid blood and the evil bat eyes?

I don't have any of the relevant professions so I'm just going to be hunting mobs.

If my only two options than are the bloods in the eyes, by my calculation I would need ~450 to reach 1200 tickets?


I'll have 312 tickets once i'm done turning in plumes.
1200-312 = 888 tickets left
10x bloods or eyes = 20x tickets
888 / 20 = 44.4 turn ins

Does this sound right, with anyone with experience?  Thank you!5",19,1583873424,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fgktj3/dmf_1200_tickets_math/,classicwow,1

fgkqgr,torshakle,*Casual appreciation post!*,"Just read a post a moment ago about a fella that had been levelling without bracers for an unknown period and noticed some people teasing him for taking 7 days /played to get to lvl 42~ish.

I just wanted to say that I appreciate all of the casuals and newcomers out there. I'm somewhat of an altoholic and have characters at all sorts of levels. It's an absolute joy to run across players who need help or direction out in the world or on a dungeon run.

I was really looking forward to classic solely for the experience of hanging out in an mmo and having fun with new people in the community. I got my druid to 60 and did some raiding, but in the end I realized that I'm really not that interested in end game content. Downing Ragnaros was really my big goal, it was a dream for me back in 2005. Once I achieved that, I felt like I didn't need to progress any further and started rolling alts.

I still think it's awesome that there are people out there dedicated to clearing content and getting geared, but I know that I don't need to participate in order to enjoy it. Sort of like playing baseball in a beer league. I want to play, but I don't need to win or keep score or join a serious tournament.

I was worried that the intensity and lateral influence of players stomping through content would send a message to anyone else that there's no point playing if you're not going to decorate yourself in epics. It's really up to the player what they want to do in Classic and I was concerned that anyone not ready for raiding would be discouraged and quit.

Anyways, my point is, I really have a lot of fun with the people who are just here to play their own way and not worry about being the best. I think the devs spent a lot of their time on world building for Vanilla, and it's something that's kind of lost in future expansions, as they're usually centered around end game content.

Tl;dr: keep on being you, you filthy casuals. You make the game feel alive and I love you for it. It really wouldn't be the same if not for you guys.",6,1583873130,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fgkqgr/casual_appreciation_post/,classicwow,1

They decided the easiest and fastest way is to split all classic servers into two Battlegroups. East coast servers and west coast server Battlegroups. Several other solutions have been thought of. I.E. 12:00 am PST reset and 3:00 am EST resets. Or have each server have its own holiday, given that the honor you gain only affects your server.

fgj96k,daveberth,The death of competitive Pacific WSG?,"''In order to have players from different realms in agreement on whether or not a Battleground Holiday is active, with maintenance tomorrow, we will divide all realms in the Americas into two battlegroups by timezone: Eastern Time and Pacific Time.''

Blizz just dropped this as a second thought about the Holiday weekend. Seemingly the servers will now be divided into two Battlegroups (East and West)  and as someone from Fairbanks, we won't be able to face any of the best premades from Faerlina, Herod, Stalagg, Skream, Kromcrush...

This is another horrible blow to people who play Classic WoW for the PvP rivalries, storylines, and tryhard games. I would estimate 80 to 90% of our best and most funs game are against a team from an Eastern time server.

It's like Blizzard can't help themselves but fuck people who love classic PVP over.

First, with the AV meta, WEEKS of WSG story building and actual competition was LOST as you would get much more honor from sitting in AV discords all day doing what amounts to PVE.

WEEKS LATER it was finally fixed with one simple change (removing queue numbers)... as people were hitting Rank 12-13.

Thankfully they were faster to fix the queue dodging meta, but now they come out of the woodwork and drop this bomb on Pacific servers.

There is no reason for us to continue queueing if 1 out of 100 games is competitive and as good PvP players from the West Coast come to that realization, people will either quit the game, migrate off or simply abandon their favorite part of the game.

This is a huge concern to us. I don't know if it's possible to come to terms with abandoning everyone we know on our server for the sake of better BG games or even opening up our wallet to a game company that keep messing up a game we all love.",33,1583867810,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fgj96k/the_death_of_competitive_pacific_wsg/,classicwow,1

flash foward to 2020 and yeh its pretty damn amazing not having any bugs leveling 1-60, having quests and dungeons perform how they should be thats great.

but fuck me im having 2 major issues i never encountered on 4-6 pservers i played on in the past
1. spellbatching window is too big for modern internet
2. gtting disconnects and lag way more than i ever did on pservers
3.  bots are running wild for weeks and fucking weeks and theyre still there doing their thing.
 
ive wanted blizz vanilla servers since i played back in TBC times (when i first started wow) and fuck me is it sad to see that i had more fun on pservers than this clown fiesta they call vanilla

even wpvp is fucking ruined, they allow for these mega populaton servers yet they lag into oblivion even if its only around 100v100 yet in vanilla they could handle this, and if you look at nostalriious launch of the dragons of nightmare youd see tons more people and even less lag

'go back to pservers then' i can already hear

i would if the launch of classic wow didnt kill them.

fghgua,Elidian,Where to level at 56?,"Just curious if anyone had any thoughts on where to level at 56 as Feral Druid. I've done most of the Un'goro quests, I'm done with Western Plaguelands, I've done most of the quests in Felwood, still have about half the available quests left in Winterspring, I haven't touched Azshara, and Eastern Plaguelands is where I just recently landed, but it's a PITA with practically all of the mobs tossing a disease on you. Some of those things are like 10-30 minute duration, and the only way for me to get rid of it is by using up all of my Jungle Remedy consumables, which are on a 2 minute reuse but so often have I cured disease just to turn around and get hit by another the very next mob I pull, so I tend to have to blow remedies on cooldown or kill a few mobs with the disease on me, which really slows you down.

I was thinking Winterspring and/or Azshara until 58 or so, then maybe back to Eastern Plaguelands, that way I'll have some more money to throw towards buying more consumables for removing disease. I know that I'll have to finish the Darrowshire quest line because I need that Ring of Protection, but it's not an absolute must have for leveling, so I'm okay with putting it off for now.

fgh3bi,omegalulreddit,"People who wait for TBC, tell me why you like more than Vanilla","So for me, TBC is the best Addon hands down.

It's still only the second best version of the game for me though. I personally don't value the supposedly better class balance and raids over everything else classic offers. I don't want to get too deep into this now but to make it **very** short and simple, I don't consider a hybrid doing the same amounts of DPS than a pure DPS better class balance per se. Like I said, I don't want to argue over balance in this thread.

  
From my point of view, TBC will result in a pretty similar way to play the game than retail already does. What I mean by that is spamming heroics, doing raids, sitting in shat and wait for the arena queue to pop. That's pretty much all TBC offers from my narrow point of view. I would like to know where I'm wrong here and why it's so desired. 

For me, TBC is like mentioned the best addon, but classic is just superior in every way apart from raids and maybe some dungeons. I can only back my thoughts up with the ""data"" provided by history up to this point which is that TBC Servers never got even close to the population vanilla servers had.

If I am currently rank 6 and hit Bracket 10 each week, is there an easy way to calculate how many weeks it will take to actually get rank 10?  Does going into Bracket 11 or Bracket 12, while at lower ranks, substantially improve how quickly rank you gain each week or does it not really make a big difference?

fgelzf,RolyThePaladin,Wow Classic Paladin Gold Farming | Dungeon Edition Part 2,"**Intro:**

Hello Reddit! This is my second forum post here relating to my classic wow dungeon gold farming guides. I say guides, they were more like a test to see if the dungeon is a viable gold farm or not. Anyhow the videos are guides if you follow the route exactly how I do and listen to what I say in each video. If you’ve read my previous post relating to my wow classic dungeon gold farming series part 1 playlist on YouTube then you’ll know what to expect from this post. I almost didn’t want to post this as I haven’t been able to check off BRD or Scholo. Being honest as a paladin I’m not even sure it is possible to make a decent gold per hour in them solo, maybe you could sell tanking services but I don’t really like to do that.

So lets get into it shall we. The people who will benefit the most from these videos and this post are typically going to be mages at the number 1 spot due to their insane aoe abilities, followed fairly close by the paladin class (which is what I am) especially now that we as paladins have the ability to get spell power from the judgement set, which by the way is amazing when you combine it with skull flame shield and demonforged breastplate. If you’ve seen some of my bigger pulls that are fairly recent you’ll see my hp goes up rather than down now. Specifically these guides on my channel and the written version that you’re reading now is targeted towards the paladin class, however. Mages can do this just as if not more effectively. Also note that the same routes could potentially be done by other classes, just not as efficiently unfortunately. 

Below will be a break down of each dungeon in the second part of the series (the second playlist on my channel, labelled WOW CLASSIC GOLD FARMING Classic Dungeon Edition Part 2 is specifically what we’re looking at today) as you know if you follow me or have read the first post, I went into every dungeon in the game with the exception of a few that I’ve not done yet. Them being the higher level ones. You will see a total time spent farming the dungeon, the total gold made from vending items and come to the conclusion if it is viable or not for a decent gold per hour farming route.

The exact dungeons covered in this post will be all of the videos I made in the playlist mentioned above, which by the way you can find a link to this playlist right here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5M\_CX4VSPQjcAKQt38s9vC-jFj-gwMxN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5M_CX4VSPQjcAKQt38s9vC-jFj-gwMxN)

The list is as follows: 

1. Razorfen Downs x2 (I did 2 separate videos on this as I was able to both aoe and boss hunt)
2. Zul’Farrak
3. Uldaman
4. SM Cath (Revisited, showing it’s potential if you did it solo)
5. Maraudon
6. Sunken Temple
7. Dire Maul East (Lashers)
8. Strath (Multiboxing)

Unfortunately as I say, I’ve not been able to complete the final few dungeons because at the time I was doing it was before Black Wing Lair. So I hadn’t got the better gear I have now, also in the fact that. The remaining ones are end game content so you can’t really solo it as a paladin unfortunately. At least not in the style of farming I was going for anyways lol. (mass AOE)

So, why should we even consider any of these farms? Well to your surprise, you may actually make a decent amount of gold from these guides I’ve made. In this post I won’t go over the tactics or routes for each and every single dungeon as that would be far too much text and you’d probably be sat here reading for over an hour. XD But I will cover the basis of gold made, the time it took and any additional things I feel relevant. This style of farming isn’t as popular as I initially thought going into classic. Which is strange as it is genuinely a decent way to make gold in game consistently without worrying about luck unlike some of the other gold farms you might find online. The inspiration from this was actually the WowHobbs videos way back when, which by the way. That dude is a living legend in the game so much respect there.

As mentioned above, the how is essentially going into the dungeons, gathering all of the mobs up and AoEing them all down and collecting all the loot. Sure, it’s no arcane crystal dire maul farm or some crazy ass 1 pull mara farm. But it is realistic, and it is achievable by the average joe like myself. The key to make decent gold is to be consistent with it, for example doing this for 1 hour per day every day. When you look at your bank alt after a week you’ll notice a nice amount of gold sitting there after you’ve sold all of the items. Sure I make use of the Auction House in some of the guides, but the majority of the time I do try and only use vendor money for it as we all know the Auction House is never 100% - although by disenchanting most of the greens or blues the mats typically will almost always sell, and they’re free to post too….. And….. I’m rambling too much.

I would also finally like to say that, if you do like the look of one of the farms I am about to break down for you. Then feel free to check out the video on how it is done, there you will see exactly how I was able to do it by following along the method I did in the video and then you will be able to do it for yourself too!

The recommended gear is at least all blue gear at level 50+ and the essential items are SkullFlame Shield and the DemonForged Breastplate, I would also consider taking a really fast weapon such as Flurry Axe to gain those consistent heals from Seal Of Light. Flurry Axe is amazing for this due to its 1.50 speed and the chance on hit to gain an extra attack, combining it with the other 2 items then your survivability will be fairly high.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Breakdown:**

* Razorfen Downs, Version 1

In this version of the instance I break is down into 4 simple pulls as seen in the video, just like the SM videos I’ve done I do need a healer and an aoe dps. Although to be fair the aoe dps isn’t that essential, the main one needed if a healer to throw you a few heals. So if you do boost people whilst you’re doing this then just remember that.

The run would typically take around 10 to 15 minutes as I only do a specific portion of the dungeon, be aware that some mobs will evade though which sucks.

The gold made per hour is anywhere from 20 to 30 gold per hour if you vendor everything, but going up to around 50 to 60 gold if you get lucky with boss drops and disenchant the boss items for the shards as they typically will sell for a decent price.

The route is amazing because as soon as the final boss is down its a quick run back to the start so you’re not wasting much time here.

&amp;#x200B;

* Razorfen Downs, Version 2

The second version of this was actually an idea that came to mind after doing the first video on this. I realised that the bosses I killed do give the small radiant shards quite often and there is a potential to get 5 per run which means you’re looking at around a solid 10g or more per run by following this route.

As a level 60 I was able to skip all of the trash (if you’re careful) which is great because any class can do this! The majority of gold will come from the shards as this is what we’re farming here. By following the route you can easily make up to 60 gold per hour doing this. 

Typically just like the previous version you can do this in around 10 to 15 minutes. Now I recommend doing this if you’re solo and don’t care about boosting people. It is super easy to do and by following the route in the video you can make a decent price from it.

Keep in mind to disenchant items you only need level 1 enchanting which is great because you won’t need to spend any time or gold levelling it up.

&amp;#x200B;

* Zul’Farrak

This is an annoying one due to the totems that the mobs drop, if you’ve got say 3 mages with you it won’t be much of an issue due to the sheer dps being done. But if you’re taking a mixed group then have someone constantly destroying the healing totems. A healer and a mage are advised to bring along to this route too as it can be difficult without.

You can get up to 50g or more per hour here if the lower levels in the group are of the optimal composition and know the route you’re doing well. The majority of the gold will come from vendor trash but things like the cloth and certain greens or boe blues can increase this nicely.

Typically I found my runs ranging from 10 minutes on the fastest, and 20 on the slowest. Also your bags can get full rather fast here as there is a lot of loot to pickup. Which means more trips to the vendor. But it is balanced out by the amount of money made by selling things due to their higher level.

It will be fairly easy to find people looking for groups here as the level range is around 42 to 52 so you’ll have lots of eager players looking to push towards the final half of the levelling process.

This could be higher in gold made per hour with certain items such as swiftness pots, free action pots and the invincibility one (immune to all damage for 6 seconds) The only issue with this is, those items all cost gold so I prefer not to use anything to my gold farming sessions.

Although it is essential to have assistance from 2 healers and 2 aoe dps (optimal set up for this place) This in my opinion isn’t quite at the level of selling tanking services, it’s still technically a boost. Albeit it is borderline. You can still do this faster than a standard spell cleave group so this is why I consider it as a boost and not at tanking service. The best part of it all though is the fact they get some sweet xp so they will be thankful for you :D

&amp;#x200B;

* Uldaman

This one is a hit and miss really, it did have potential but it just falls short due to the funny level ranges. What I mean is, half the bosses in the route could have given the small radiant shards, but due to level in gear they items become the larger ones which do not sell for nearly as much. If it wasn’t the case it would be on par with the second RFD video.

The total gold made per hour here is around 24 gold and the way we aquire this is by killing 2 easy bosses as seen in the video.

The route I came up with is around 10 to 15 minutes long and can be done completely solo. Do take note however, there is the off chance (insanely rare off chance, like you’re more likely to get hit by lightning kinda off chance) to have the super rare blue level 39 twink item. The Pendulum of Doom which sells for a very lucrative price.

&amp;#x200B;

* SM Cath (Revisited)

This was just a revisit before Black Wing lair released. I hadn’t gotten the T2 legs at this point which I was gutted about because I really waned to try it with the best items from Phase 1 and 2.

I did show how this can potentially be a very good gold farm in the future though by showing the gold I made from doing it solo. Just note that since doing this I have been able to do the entire courtyard in 1 pull solo. I’ve also done it in 1 pull in a group. So it is realistic to do this, providing you’v got the gear. (video to SM Cath 1 Pull here: 

You can make 6 to 8 gold in raw loot here alone. Then providing you vendor all of the trash and make correct use of the AH you can easily reach up to 80 gold from 5 runs. The only issue is the time it takes to do it, if you can do this in 10 to 15 minutes per run then you’ve nailed and awesome 80g per hour gold farm.

&amp;#x200B;

* Maraudon

Unfortunately this is where it begins to become sketchy. I am aware that paladins can solo princess, although I’ve only tried and failed myself to do that once. 

In anycase. I managed to make it work as a duo farm with a hunter, although I suspect it can work for most set ups. Weather that be a mage and paladin, warlock paladin, rogue paladin. what ever. The total gold made per hour is upto 75g although since it is a duo it’s instantly cut in half unfortunately. 

Each run took us between 10 and 15 minutes to do also. So by following the video you can also achieve the same thing as it is a fairly easy farm with 2 of you.

&amp;#x200B;

* Sunken Temple

This one is another one it gets tricky. You won’t be able to solo it and you will need skinning to make the most gold from it. Do take note though that the skinning items from here will take a while to sell especially now as there is not such a high demand for it.

You can make around 66 gold per hour here but as mentioned, it is a duo farm so its split in half again.

The time spent here is around 10 minutes which is decent and the total pulls I do is 4.

It is difficult due to some of the dragons causing one of you to go to sleep so be extra cautious of that! Also note the best class to bring with you is a mage. To be very honest with you here though, a mage could solo this method I show providing they’re very good at mass aoe pulling. which means that as a paladin you can be made redundant here.

&amp;#x200B;

* Dire Maul East (Lashers)

Very popular gold farm, especially for paladins and probably well over cooked at this point. But it had to be covered anyway since the point of the series is to do every dungeon in the game.

It’s a decent gold per hour and is super easy to do. The low risk of death makes this very saught after as you can do it with your eyes closed.

The gold made per hour here will mostly come from vendor trash ranging between 40 and 60 gold per hour depending upon luck. Some of the green items do disenchant into the eternal essences (hopefully this is the correct one, that sells for about 7 gold each) You’ll also come across a lot of herbs here too so if you are a herbalist you can make extra gold from it making it closer to the 60 gold/hour mark.

If you are one of the luckier players you’ll increase the total by a fair amount. Myself personally have seen 2 epics from here which is cool as fuck

The run will typically take about 10 minuets but to reset you’ll need either a friend or alt to do, if you do use an alt to reset it’ll take about 1 minuet or so to do in order for the leader spot to be passed back to your main.

&amp;#x200B;

* Strath

This was a fun one to do and is unique. The issue lies in it is only multi boxer specific as again, you won’t be able to solo this as a paladin…. with one character at least.

If you are fortunate enough to be in a financial situation where you can afford to pay for 5 accounts each month and do have a decent software for this then this will be by far one of the best gold farms out there giving a solid 100 to 200 or more gold per hour depending on drops, the majority of this will come from the orbs which you’ll highly likely have one drop per run. The rest is from vendor trash which all sells for a fairly high price due to being high in level. If you get lucky like we did certain boe blues like mirahs song can drop (similar ring to song stone of iron forge) which sells for an easy 300g even now which is crazy

The time it takes though is where it gets tricky. If you’re familiar with this and know how to do it and have had plenty of practice then you can squeeze 2 runs per hour here. if not then its only one. after 2 runs we was getting close to the 30 minute per run mark so it is possible (although it was me and the other person multi boxing so solo it might not be possible, who knows)

But I wanted to include this for 3 reasons. One, it’s cool. Two, it’s different &amp; three is that it can be paladin specific if you multi box with 5 paladins which in strath is very possible especially with all the blessings and auras along with the fact the class can heal tank and dps.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

So there we have it everyone. Thank you for taking the time to read. Hopefully it has been insightful for you and opened your eyes to some new gold farms. Most of these in the second part of the series are very good for making gold in my opinion and I do regularly go back to them when I have the time as seen in some of my lets play episodes where I set a goal for the day of total gold made in each session and see if I can smash it or not. Which is a great idea to give you more insights into these gold farms I’ve done.

One final thing before I do end the post is that, I have essentially covered every dungeon in the game as a gold farm now aside form the 2 mentioned and put them all into a 2 part video series on YouTube. This isn’t the end all be all of the channel though, I do make other content too in the form of lets play episodes and more recently the outdoor gold farming series which I am currently working on.

fgeijp,Srocksly,A better debuffs priority list,"The subject of debuff priority comes up frequently when discussing the (mis)use of debuffs slots in raids. The mechanism is nice, that each debuff has a priority classification and debuffs from a lower tier can not overwrite debuffs from tiers above it. As far as I understand the tiers are broken down in general categories: lowest tier is pure DOT, middle tier is vulnerabilities and top is things like taunt, cc and others (?). Whenever the subject comes up all I really see is people directly or indirectly pulling information from this post from a private server (https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/42469-debuff-priority-list/). This list seems to have some questionable classifications (corruption in middle tier, for instance). Furthermore just from anecdotes, I hear mages constantly complaining about winters chill getting pushed off which should be pretty much impossible if it's high priority. At this point we have a disgusting amount of data available in logs, has anyone tried to write something to crawl through this data to make a more formal and precise list? With the crazy levels of optimization that exist in this game at this point, it's surprising that we don't have a better list.

fge6di,Strathcanaird,Best EU servers as of March 2020,"Hey all. Hope you are doing great in both life and Azeroth.

I recently joined back on my lv50 tank after leaving for 3 months due to financial reasons.
Now I'm back my current server (Zandalar Tribe) seems very quiet and hard to come by friendly folk.

I was wondering what servers right now are the best experience? I would want to play on a PvP server with a pretty even split of Horde and Alliance but I cannot find a recent discussion on the best server.

So what server do you recommend as a balanced, cooperative environment as I go into the final 10 levels before raiding?",15,1583848544,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fge6di/best_eu_servers_as_of_march_2020/,classicwow,1
fge5sd,n-ghost,Soloing Shadowfang Keep at levels 28–29.,"Heya folks,

This is the next video in (hopefully) long-ish series dedicated to beating all available dungeons at their suggested levels whilst soloing. Quick recap of my self-imposed rules:

* 'Soloing' means 'one character kills all the stuff by himself without any active or passive help from any other player character inside the same instance'. So, no multiboxing, no army of paladins in the background for auras etc.
* The video itself is more or less educational. I really tried to break down each and every pull, mob, boss, jump, quest and whatever else you might need to be able to beat it alone, and, what's more important, *to do it better than me*. This includes a non-exploitative demonstration on how to circumvent Arugal's MC (which usually resets the encounter, if you go at him solo).
* Consequently, this is *not* a speedrun. The video is 2 hours and 16 minutes long (still shorter than the Deadmines though!), and a good half of it is fast-forwarded at 300% speed. There are timestamps in a video description listing all of the major encounters, and there is always a lingering timestamp that points out to the Next Major Thing inside the video itself.
* I don't add any music unless it (maybe) fits the narrative somehow.
* I also don't speak and don't use any facecams. Whatever info is in this video, it comes as a text.
* I do it as melee.

The video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P2ZrJzuBdY). Enjoy, if you will.

In other, less important news: since my previous message I've managed to complete most of the mid-level stuff  I wanted to, right up to Uldaman. 

&gt;!(Gnomeregan: levels 38-39; SMGY: 39; SMLIB: 41-43; SMARM: 43; SMCATH: 43-46; RFD: 48-49; Uldaman: 49-53?, I guess).!&lt;

Uldaman itself is like 3/4 done, I stopped shortly before that thingy that requires 3 guys to click on. Will continue soon.

Things still to do: ZF, Maraudon, ST, BRD, Scholomance, Dire Maul, Stratholme, BRS. I'm level 53 at the moment, and fairly undergeared.

I failed to complete Extinguishing the Idol before level 50, but it can be done. Obviously failed to start Scarlet library before level 40. I blame Thermaplugg.

My impressions in the end: SFK has really steep difficulty curve. If you go there before level 30, it's moderately easy for the first half, and knee-crushing hard for about the last third. 

The good thing is that anyone can probably do their class quests there as soon as they get them -- solo. The bad thing is that some bosses (I'm looking at you, Nandos) are so wildly randomized, you might as well just toss a coin to decide the outcome of an encounter.

SFK really favours physical DPS. Casters will be severely gimped in a good half of the encounters, which is rather discouraging imo. Challenges inside will probably be easiest for a druid and hardest for a priest.

I also got Guillotine Axe. Was trying to sell it for 3 months, in the end got rid of it for like 3g, probably paying much more in AH fees .\_.

&amp;#x200B;

My next stop will be a rather short foray into Ragefire Chasm. I'm level 31 in there; to have a proper challenge soloing it, you have to start it perhaps at like level 20. Bleh.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: Classic can be a nice single-player soulslike, and I hope to keep those videos coming.

fgax5z,mistadong,A discussion: Ashkandi prio between warriors and hunters,"So I'd like to discuss Ashkandi, Great Sword of the Brotherhood and source of envy between classes. I am writing this from the perspective of the Horde. Disclaimer, I myself am an orc warrior using a 2H slam spec. 

When I researched this weapon on the forums, there were a lot of unbacked assertions that Ashkandi should go to one class or another and also clouded by the usual meming.

It's my goal to discuss this weapon and why it should be prio to warrior &gt; hunters. 

1. Warrior 2H fury DPS is a raid viable spec. Some will make the unbacked assertion that 2h is a PvP spec and not ideal for PVE content. I would argue that 2H on horde side is actually superior to dual wield on any boss fights with multiple targets and also on almost all trash pulls. Anecdotally, using a pre-BiS unstoppable Force I am able to consistently outperform dual wield warriors with deathbringers or viskagg mainhand on fights such as Lucifron, Gehennes, Sulfuron, Rattlegore, etc. With 2 or more targets, high weapon damage will lead to an amplified benefit of whirlwind and cleave and lead to superior overall damage with 2H. Of course, WF on horde side also relatively benefits 2H more than dual wield. 

2. Ashkandi is a top tier raid weapon for warriors, I would argue equivalent or superior to BRE, Spinal reaper, Untamed Blade, Draketalon cleaver. I make this assertion after doing thorough testing with Sims, review of Fight Club data on proc rates, querying warriors on my server, etc.
- BRE has long been considered the best 2H because of its stacking armor debuff weapon proc. This is certainly true in the PvP setting. However in a raid setting, the boss armor is usually fully debuffed when your raid uses it's proper debuffs (sunder, fairie fire, annihilator stacks) and thus for bosses BRE becomes just another 2H sword with significantly less weapon damage than Ashkandi. Note: BRE still has great potential with trash still, as those will not have full raid armor debuffs usually.
- Untamed Blade has an amazing proc with 300 str for 8 seconds. This has been found to proc approx once per minute. While proccing it is arguably the best 2H in the game. However, the proc rate is lower than originally hoped for. On average, if proccing once a minute that means it provides a 600 AP benefit for 13% of the fight. Or an average of 80AP - thus you can think of UTB as a 71dps sword with 80AP in place of the proc , which allows us to better compare to Ashkandi, a 81DPS sword with 86AP
- Spinal reaper and Draketalon cleaver are both axes that become top tier when wielded by an orc. This is bc the 305 weapon skill decreases glancing blows damage reduction by 20%. It is known that 40% of white attacks glance. Thus an orc wielding these two axes has a 40% * 20% increase in damage due to higher weapon skill, which equals 8% damage increase. Even with this damage increase, Ashkandi is superior in DPS.

3. Hunters have better dual wield options. For hunters, the weapon they wield is largely a stat stick. While 86 AP on Ashkandi seems amazing (and yes, it is awesome), hunters have better dual wield options. I'll even give an example in which using preBiS is better. 
- Bone slicing Hatchet from Strat UD has 13 agility; with 15 agi enchant that's 28 agility. Dual wielding these means you have 56 agi - thus 112AP!!! Far more than Ashkandi. 
- Yes, a hunter may say that they could do a melee weave with Ashkandi to increase their DPS by 1-2%. I personally doubt this is the most fun or efficient playstyle but I'll take their word for it - even if we assume this, if argue that the hunters have an at least equivalent pre BiS option whereas the warrior has a definite DPS advantage with Ashkandi compared to their other options.


TLDR: Ashkandi should go to warriors &gt; hunters. 2h warrior is great for raiding, Ashkandi is a top tier weapon equiv or superior to other 2H, hunters have other better dual wield options.

fgafo3,bucooks,New player incoming,"I’ve always thought WoW, and especially classic, looked like a cool game that would be a lot of fun to get into. Now I’m at university, I’ve got the time, money and inclination. 

Unfortunately none of my friends play WoW, so I was curious to see if anyone had any advice on how to start up and get through the game solo. Obviously I’d love to make friends through the game, join a guild etc but I’m assuming as a first time player with no experience that might be difficult.

I’ve done some research into the different classes and races etc, and have some ideas about what I’d like. However any suggestions for something that would help me get through the levelling experience solo or is particularly fun to play would be great. 

Fully aware I’ll have to chuck in a few hundred hours just to get to 60 and access end game content, but it’s a grind I’m looking forward to.

The thing is russian translation of WoW Classic is bloody awful. It contains misspelling, misleading descriptions (such as completely opposite or non-relative words), some stuff that was copy-pasted by mistake, and simply descriptions without clarity. And like i had to face my eyes bleed day to day, check wowhead for english descriptions of items and stuff to make sure how things work. Happens you know. It was more of annoying and.. just felt shitty you know? Playing on official server which i pay for and stuff but experience some low-quality pirate-server-level memes.   


But like few days ago translation got my ass burning. After playing druid almost since the start of server (month or so later) and after getting pvp trinket asap I found out that it removes fears only few days ago. How so? The thing is in russian insignia says: "".. removes all Charm, POLYMORPH effects and Stuns"". And i believed to it's description (alltho trinket that removes poly for druid felt weird somewhere back in my mind). I accidently checked it's english description on wowhead and just speechlessly flipped my table. I'm not gonna write down all the messed up descriptions because i guess that's already a pretty large text. I'll just spice it up with the fact that shaman's wolf form buff says ""DECREASE movement speed"".

I am mostly a solo PvPer so I diversify alot of my World PvP action while queuing BGs. I find it hard to imagine if a real person looked into my account they would find I was Botting. I must be a victim of some type of false-positive detection for staying up during my last days ranking or something.

Again, I would like to make it CLEAR. I never used a BOT/3RD party program to help me on my ranking grind. Every time I jumped, I personally clicked spacebar... Everytime I'm in BG's I played it out... I took no short-cut in my rank grind which is unfortunate that Blizzard seems to think I did so.

 To fellow Rankers, Be aware that this situation could happen to you. It seems Blizzard's bot detection software could include legitimate players as well. If you plan to start/Are currently in this grind, be WARNED that this could happen to you as well. Good Luck on the fields of Azeroth because I will no longer will.

ps. I even offered more information regarding my ban even as sending my hardware for them to check it out themselves, seems like they are happy with their decision banning legitimate players.

fg2038,B33rtaster,Saving Naxxramus,"Naxxramus is in danger of falling victim to the same fate it had in vanilla. As the last raid in Classic WoW, Naxxramus has 2 major problems facing it.

1. Players compete it and quit --- Every guild has had to deal with empty slots from raiders that don't want to farm Molten Core to gear out the whole raid. Unless TBC or Classic+ is announced Naxx is Classic's end point.
2. TBC gets announced --- Its late 2006 all over again. Why do Naxx when all that gear is about to be invalidated. This is VERY LIKELY. It requires little effort from Blizz to implement compared to any kind of Classic+.

I think the one way to save Naxx is to give a reason for players to keep raiding Naxx. Like delaying TBC and adding a Classic+ phase designed around using the Naxx gear. I don't care if Classic+ works or not, but rather Naxxramus is given some breathing space that'll extend its lifespan hopefully.",100,1583788455,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fg2038/saving_naxxramus/,classicwow,1

fg14se,_Falathrin_,Classic is the worst Vanilla experience I've had to date,"Lately I've been feeling like I've been forcing myself to log on.

I thought I'd type out a list with brief explanations on what I think is wrong with the game, and how it all added up in the big picture that made this the worst Vanilla experience for me personally to date, and why I'm quitting as a result.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Initial Wave of Servers**: Underestimated Classic's potential. This resulted in players skewing up on those initial ones making it very undesirable to roll on new ones that came out afterwards. This contributed to faction imbalances which all lead to server transfers that were carelessly done causing negative impacts on all servers and factions. 

- **Layering**: Doesn't need much explanation. Resources duplicated on layers. Scattered server communities. Exploitable. Un-immersive. Etc.

- **Mega Servers**: I despise mega servers. Vanilla was designed around 3k tightly-knit communities. There are plenty of players from my faction and the opposite faction that I've never encountered. That ""faceless"" feel from retail made it through to Classic as a result, maybe not as bad, but it definitely doesn't feel the way it did back in Vanilla because of over population.

- **Modern Engine/Client**: Camera work, the way my character moves, (some) combat animations, (some) combat sounds are all off. I thought I was being biased until I recently logged on an instant 60 Vanilla Private Server for about 10 minutes and I almost immediately noticed how much better/more fluid the old engine/client felt. Classic feels like retail in Vanilla skin.


- **Batching &amp; Broken Class Mechanics**: Batching is heavily despised throughout the community. I understand people asked for an authentic Vanilla experience. People had bad internet back in the day. People don't nowadays. Batching made sense back in the day. It doesn't today. We asked for batching so that 2 sheeps could happen at the same time for instance. The way it's on Vanilla Private Server feels almost perfect. We didn't ask for this large 400 MS batch window which made the whole game feel clunky.

There are some broken class mechanics here and there such as as Hunters traps and pet management.

- **Game Aesthetics**: This is a minor issue in the grand scheme of things, but it still adds up. Colors, shading, lighting are all off. The ""Classic"" graphics toggle is honestly a joke when you have a 1.12 Client opened up and compare them side by side. 


- **Leveling Experience**: This undoubtedly was the worst leveling experience I've had to date. Almost everyone cleaved to 60. The raid XP bug/glitch in early stages did not help either (even though apparently this was reported multiple times on the Beta). LFG/LFM channels where just spammed with cleave requests. The world felt emptier than what it should have.


- **No Itemization: Private Servers did this and it worked incredibly well. Why was it not replicated on Classic? Having no itemization and timeline drops ofcourse lead to players being over-decked in gear before BWL came out. This as a result contributed to BWL feeling easier than what it should.


- **Phase 2 PvP &amp; AV Meta**: Phase 2 adding the honor system out of the blue was a poor decision. Had they made the Honor System available from the get go like Private Servers did, then World PvP would've been much more dynamic and fun than what we've experienced in Phase 2. What we experienced instead as a result in raid zergs from people decked out in MC gear. This is coming from someone who very much enjoys World PvP, and I did not enjoy Phase 2 World PvP at all because of this.

Why were we given the nerfed 1.12 AV instead of the pre-nerfed one? Pre-nerf AV is literally one of original Vanilla highlight experiences. When 1.12 AV came out in actual Vanilla, we had AV and BG weekends. We did not have that on Classic and it became the meta for months. 


- **Botting / Gold Selling &amp; Buying**: How does a multi billion dollar company be less effective at tackling bots and such than Private Servers devs. Ofcourse there were plenty of shady Private Server devs that did scandalous things here and there. There were good Private Servers though where these issues where tackled way more effectively. I haven't seen bots on this scale on any good Private Server before.


- **Orgrimmar Lag &amp; World Bosses Lag**: Self explanatory. Take a look at this for comparisons:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95YXxO2cZ8s





- **Warcraft Raid Logs**: This is not a game issue per say. This is a community issue. This promoted min/max mentality that has infested Classic. All I see is parse talk here and there - which is not something I'm a fan of in MMORPGs.





----


**TLDR** - Classic is not an authentic Vanilla experience by any stretch of the imagination. Horrendous decisions made by Blizzard have chained and rippled throughout the game causing significant negative impacts on the experience as a whole. The result is a watered down non-authentic artificial ""Vanilla"" experience that we pay $15/month for.",26,1583785301,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fg14se/classic_is_the_worst_vanilla_experience_ive_had/,classicwow,1

I want to get used to this kind of Tanking because I plan on tanking dungeons all the way to 60.

Do you think speccing as Deep Prot is a good idea for someone starting end-game tanking or is there something more viable?

What does your normal rotation look as a Tank specced into Deep Prot? I'm used to SS, WW, Cleave. 

What stats should I prioritize as a Tank in Deep Prot &amp; how much crit/armor/stam/AP should I obtain before speccing into DW Tanking?

ffuq24,Organizm238,"Yet another loot drama, need opinion","Yesterday guild had a planned MC run and we took 8-10 PUGs wuth us. The loot rules announced at the beginning were: legendaries/mats reserved, 1 item per person, MS&gt;OS, loot resets at Domo.

The item drops from Rag, guildie (who had the rights to roll on it and for whom it is an upgrade) wins the roll, and then he sells it to the PUG (who also rolled) for 1k gold. Half of the guild went mad about it. And I dont really get why. We don't have written rules about such situations, but it was said some raid before, that ""you get item - you keep it"". But not like official announce, more like recommendation in dispute.

My view:

He went to the raid, did his job, and won the roll. At that point he has all the rights to have the item. After that we shouldn't really care what he does with it. If he thinks that 1k gold is a bigger upgrade for him - fine. Maybe he will buy 2 items for that gold and bring nice consumables for raids, so guild will benefit more. And it was not usual situation like 'guild fucks pugs', when everyone rolls just to not give item to pug. If a PUG won the roll and did the same - noone would have been complaining.

Am I wrong and guildie have done something terrible? Like breaking some eternal guild respect rule I don't know. Tell me please.",86,1583760855,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ffuq24/yet_another_loot_drama_need_opinion/,classicwow,1

ffl6ix,winterwolf24,How would you rate the fun factor of the 3 cloth wearing classes? Struggling with what to play as,"Based off pure aesthetics, type of magic, etc. my first instinct was to play priest.

I like the dichotomy of light and shadow magic, the shadow side has sorta vampire motif...but upon further research the shadow side is largely a meme spec. I had really bad luck and the 3 things that sounded pretty fun to me (retribution paladin, shadow priest, and balance druid) all pretty much fucking suck. I'm struggling with what to go with.

I don't really heal in MMOs, but trying something new does sound kinda fun, so I'm still thinking about priest a bit (maybe could be swayed toward holy paladin if people think it is significantly more fun. I just like the spellcaster aesthetic so I am leaning towards a cloth wearer)

Warlock sounds like it would be a safer pick due to being strictly DPS, but while I like the Warlock magic, I am concerned about not liking having to control a pet. If pet controls are cumbersome, the AI is bad, etc. I don't think I will like despite really digging the shadow and fire theme.

Mage just sounds a little too basic. Maybe the gameplay in practice is more fun, but they just seem generic.

What do you all think is the most fun caster to play? I'm really bummed that Balance and Shadow don't seem to be like viable raid specs. I really like the idea of nature and moon magic and vampiric shadow magic.",61,1583709733,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ffl6ix/how_would_you_rate_the_fun_factor_of_the_3_cloth/,classicwow,1

ffgwo0,Obtusely,My guild is making having a 60 Alt mandatory for split runs...what do I do?,"So when I first joined this guild a few months ago there was no policy or signs that a policy like this would be implemented. We were/are clearing MC very smoothly and now we’re having fun in BWL and things are going well.

However, my GM recently stated that everyone would have to have a 60 Alt by a deadline for splitruns or face loot penalties on their main. I feel like this is a huge red flag in terms of leadership and decision making by trying to force people into something they might not want to do or not have the time to do, but considering most people in this guild have alts I’m wondering if I should just suck it up and level an alt?. For the record, I would not have joined a guild that required an alt in the first place so I feel like I’m in the right here since this was a decision made months after I joined.

I’d be interested to hear from people in “semi-hardcore” or “hardcore” guilds if this is something that is normal. This is a loot council guild so there’s no guarantee I won’t be penalised for loot behind the scenes for not having a 60 alt even if the policy itself isn’t implemented.",215,1583693060,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ffgwo0/my_guild_is_making_having_a_60_alt_mandatory_for/,classicwow,1
ffgkvx,Rebel_Redcoat,I feel bad about an interaction I just had in game and want to vent.,"So, I'm in Wetlands trying to finish the last quests I have there. I'm LFG in general about Nek'rosh and this group invites me. They're all dead and re-spawning at where Nek'rosh is and I'm all the way at the elite Dark Iron Dwarf area because I'm also LFG for that quest. 

So, I say what's up and that I'm omw. As I'm getting close, I have to stealth to avoid all the orcs on the way up to the boss and the group leader is telling me to hurry up because mobs are re-spawning. I literally can't go any faster and he says to the group to just go ahead without me. I pull every trick to get there faster, un-stealthing and aggroing every orc on the way up there just to vanish when I'm close. 

By the time I get there the boss is just killed, so I grab his head and move on backwards towards a rare orc mob that I saw on my way up and that they haven't noticed. I wanna pull it before it it gets close to the other orcs so that we can kill it and get a green for the group because I felt bad for getting there late. 

Anyway, the group leader calls me a joke, accuses me of getting there just in time to ""steal"" the head, and removes me from the group. I felt really bad that circumstances made it so that I look a certain way.

I was baffled. I asked my raid if anyone else saw that and no one noticed.

Then it happened again. We were fighting Ebonroc at the ramp, I go to bandage and I’m teleported five feet in front of me. I didn’t die this time which allowed me to notice that some sort of visual effect played. It was the same effect as the one that plays when you sac a demon with Demonic Sacrifice.

So basically, hug a wall + bandage + DS = sometimes you teleport five feet in front of you.

I was looking forward to more dungeons at the level 60 cap back then. It's a shame most dodnt get to experience AQ40 or Naxx. After playing classic now, it would be nice to go back into the unknown and not be able to have all the mats for a giant event like AQ farmed up before its introduced.

ffbd37,evascale,So I tried WSG for the first time today,"I am a casual wow classic player, and lately i've gotten really bored with the game, there is nothing to do except login once a week, do my raids, and the log out again. I can sometimes play 2 days a week instead of 1 and farm some gold for next week's consumables, but that gets boring real fast too.

However, today, I decided to try some battlegrounds for the first time. I queued up in Warsong Gulch and the first game I had was amazing. It took about 30 minutes and it was very tense, we lost the first flag point but then got our shit together and scored 2 in a row, then horde got their shit together and scored 2, making us lose. Even though I lost the game I had plenty of fun, and thought maybe I could start going for rank10 or something since it isn't that bad.

After that, my next game was against a premade, 10 people from same server. On the first fight in the middle, they all used FAPs and LIPs and sappers, and crushed us easily. After that, people just went AFK and didn't resurrect, which ended up a very quick lose. After that lose I joined another, and it was another premade, after that, another. I got matched against 10 man premades 4 times in a row, and at the 4th game i just /AFK'ed and probably won't do it again.

My question is, why does Blizzard allow players to ruin a fun game mode like this? I think WSG is very much like League of Legends, or DOTA, or any other multiplayer competitive game where having good communication with players in your team is worth more than anything, and in my opinion they should not allow pugs to match with premades. Obviously there is no shortage of premades playing the game, just make them face against same amount of player premades and have them fight on equal grounds. So us pugs can go an actually enjoy the game against other pugs. There is literally no downside on doing so.",233,1583667101,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ffbd37/so_i_tried_wsg_for_the_first_time_today/,classicwow,1

ffb1qe,Spreizbacken,"Gold bots are getting smarter! I screwed with the same one I met a month ago. [Venoxis, DE]","Hey there,

some may remmember, some may not, a month ago I met Hunzuth, the troll rogue who killed ursas in Azshara. Back than I screwed with him a bunch and got him stuck couple of times in the water, wasting his day. I posted about it here:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ez88rw/screwing\_with\_a\_bot\_is\_actually\_fun\_venoxis\_de/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ez88rw/screwing_with_a_bot_is_actually_fun_venoxis_de/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today, I met him again. 

https://preview.redd.it/yq6hb7aahfl41.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41f4fe375e78232b15aa8b6f8640ace5d53da49b

This time he was smarter, much smarter. I followed him to the repair goblin, whenever there was a mob in his way, he turned to the left or right in a perfect 90 degree angle, than again and again untill he went around it.

He wasn't killing anything, just mounting up, running in botlike straight lines to certain points where mining nodes and herbs spawn, picking them up, mounting up again and on to the next spot.

Just to make sure he was still botting I sapped him as he was about to mine a rich thorium vein, mined it myself just once and left it. The node was still there, he mounted back up on his raptor and left. 

At this moment there was no doubt in my mind that this was a bot.

He had his previous knowhow on how to fight, pop evasion when attacked and pop a health pot when below 50% and follow the target for a certain period of time, than I had to lure him again.

I spent like 30 minutes on this untill I got him to the Timbermaw hold cave, full of aggressive (to him atleast) ursas, so that they can kill him, taking a bunch of his durability and at which point he will run back, release, so they can kill him again. 

It's an infinite loop untill someone intereferes and takes the spirit res.

Here's him fighting for his life.

(He managed to kill me because I was at really low HP. Some shammy interfered.)  


As of this moment, he had died there 4 times in a row, running back across the whole map to here, just to die again. The sooner he turns all red, the sooner he dies... again.

Seeing as we don't really imagine a ton of these suddenly appearing and killing the value we're in no rush, does anybody have experience/advice in selling super high value items that could offer some advice?

ff8chx,smokin_barrelz,Rogue Dagger PvE Spec (combat v seal fate),So I've been going back and forth on the idea of swapping from combat daggers (for raiding) to seal fate daggers. What I see online is that seal fate becomes viable at 30% buffed crit % compared to combat dagger spec. Right now I am sitting at 11% hit (adding dagger skill to my hit%) and at a buffed (raid buffs only no Ony buff) 39% crit. So basically if I swapped from combat I'd lose 5% crit from dagger specialization so I'd be a buffed 34% crit in seal fate spec. And 10% hit. Is it viable to swap to seal fate at this point or will it drop my DPS too much?

ff2nn1,Zimzarian,Class choice for returning player based on the current state of the game,"Hey guys,

I haven't really played Classic that much, i have a 27 rogue, 17 mage and 18 hunter. I want to come back to classic but I'm looking for input as to which class I should play based on the current state of the game. I just don't want to get to 60 to find out I have to play a spec I don't really want to just to be able to raid.

I have narrowed it down to these classes, kinda in order of preference:

1- Enhance shaman : Love the class and spec, I love ele too. Resto I wouldn't mind offspecing and healing occasionnally but to my understanding, not many RL will take a non-resto shaman into raids... Which kinda sucks.

2- Hunter : Was my main for most of Cata/MOP/WOD/Legion, loved the class a lot, still love it. However, Hunters used to be everywhere, don't know if that's still the case. So if there is a lot of hunters already, I'm guessing I might have trouble finding a guild to raid with.

3- Warlock : Was my alt of choice since MOP, never really played a lock as a main but it does look interesting. I think it might be easier to find a guild with a Warlock than with a enh shaman or hunter. The shard farming is what makes me hesitate the most.

4- Rogue : The fact that it's already almost 30 plays a big role here. Saves me some time. The gameplay is fun and for the occasionnal pvp session I do enjoy playing rogue. I'm not much of a pvper so it's not a huge factor though. However, I think out of my four choices, Rogue might be the hardest to find a raiding guild to play with, I'm assuming the rogue population is pretty heavy as of right now.



So here I am, wanting to enjoy classic but fearing my class choice might not be wise (especially if I go along with my Shaman). I'll be playing on Sulfuras, if that changes anything!

TLDR: Don't know which class to pick between enh shaman / hunter / warlock / rogue. Don't really want to have a really hard time finding a guild to raid with and anxious that I might regret my choice later on.",23,1583619774,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ff2nn1/class_choice_for_returning_player_based_on_the/,classicwow,1

fexp12,Oglethorppe,Pick apart this TBC launch proposal. Point out every flaw!,"All nitpicks welcome, the more the better. 

TBC gets announced at Blizzcon, and at some point we have a release date, lets hypothetically say May 4, 2021. Two or three months before this date, they could open up BC servers, but with the Dark Portal locked. During most of this time, transfers/copies are not allowed, so people can level fresh with the server. This would still be the same patch that TBC is released in, so people can get used to their talents or the higher quest xp. 

Then, 2-3 weeks before the Dark Portal opens, allow copies/transfers from Classic servers. Give people time to pick their guild's server and establish a community before going all the way into the next expansion. Then launch day approaches, and the world is open to explore, level, and raid, from Kara all the way to Hyjal, like the launch in 2007.

I think progressive patches is the way to go, but I think 2.4.3 is the likely scenario. If they do go with 2.4.3, the 30% blanket nerf **MUST** be removed. Similarly, I think content should be in it's toughest and most challenging versions, and it should *stay this way*. The only exceptions should be that Kara should actually drop it's updated gear, and in particular boss-by-boss instances. For example, Kael'thas being virtually unkillable could potentially see a nerf. Overall, I don't want the content to be so nerfed that the community breezes through it. Classic WoW isn't really about content, it's about community. TBC is definitely about the content, and if they release the content in a weakened state, the allure and longevity of the game is cut into thirds.

Some closing thoughts, I always try to say copy/transfer, because I'm not entirely sure which is best, perhaps give the option for both, but copies don't carry gold over, while transfers do. And of course, Classic should obviously remain a separate entity, and BC should *never* be forced onto people who just want to play Classic. I think this idea is feasible, sensible, and offers more sustained subscriber growth and retention.",33,1583599657,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fexp12/pick_apart_this_tbc_launch_proposal_point_out/,classicwow,1

You log in at 10 in the morning, you decide to go get yourself atleast a stack of Plaguebloom. You spend 2 hours in EPL doing the laps and you end up with 7 Plaguebloom, 5 Mountain Silversage and 6 Dreamfoils. 

You log off disappointed and go farm some Frostsaber rep instead.   


You decide after another 3 hours, lets go farm some Plaguebloom again. You log in and there is a Plaguebloom spawn right there next to you. ""YES PLAGUEBLOOM!"" You then do a lap and find nothing else. The Plaguebloom on login felt like Lotus on login. You imagine this because you have only actually picked one Lotus on the entire server in the 7 months you have been playing and you can't remember the feeling.

You get approached by guild mates on discord, ""Hey wuts up""

""Farming Plagueblooms, spent a few hours, don't have a stack yet"". 

***LOL!***

""Noob, we have transferred herbalists to dead servers to farm there and then create lvl 15 chars to mule these guys back to our server""

***WAIT WHAT?!*** 

""So you are telling me you are paying Blizzard money to transfer chars instead of Blizzard just normalising herb spawns?""

LOL

""Well yeah, yesterday evening I farmed up 16 stacks of Plaguebloom, 8 Arcane crystals and A bag of Mountain Silversage in 3 hours.""

Anyway, this is how my morning/afternoon has been. Apparently about 9 of my guild mates are transferring chars of the server to dead realms in order to actually get their farming done.

We were discussing it and they were saying it was just amazing, till we realised, wait, actually this is just normal spawn rates and regular amounts of farmers (they aren't alone afterall).

fetv6w,enriquex,Why AV imbalance is a system issue,"As you may be aware, there is a pretty big discrepancy in the win rates between Horde and Alliance. I believe most Alliance players have a 90% loss rate, which is absolutely massive.

I'm seeing a lot of posts where people are claiming shit like:

* Horde have to wait 90 minutes for a queue so they fight harder!

* Top PvPers went Horde so they're more skilled!

* Horde just WANT it more!

This is utter shit. Discrepancies in skill or attitude does not increase a winrate by that much.

I've played both Horde and Alliance, and there's just as many AFKers, just as many potatoes and just as many skilled players on either side.

The problem is systematic. The problem is the map imbalance. 

You first need to understand that the Horde wins aren't usually stomps. Usually, the Alliance are pulling Drek and the game ends. Horde wins because of a few advantages which give them a few extra minutes. This is usually enough to win

* Backdoor into Ally base means anyone can go in and grab towers, not just stealthers. 

* Horde cave at IBGY means taking that GY and those towers is a lot harder for Alliance

Those are the main issues, and turn a somewhat even match into a game where Horde generally have an extra 5-10 minutes to play around with

""But Horde just have a better attitude and are more skilled!""

Wrong! The teams are a random sample of 40 players taken from a larger population (of hundreds).

The Central Limit Theorem effectively means that a sample of a population generally is normally distributed. That is exactly what an AV match is doing - taking a sample of 40 players from a population. Even if that population is generally more skilled, the random sample will tend to have a normal bell curve. This means that the players skill/attitude/whatever shit you wanna try and quantify will most likely follow a normal distribution and will most likely be very similar to Alliance.

But wait! Maybe the average Horde skill is *that* much higher that the 40 people randomly selected are on average, far better than Alliance

The reason why the ""skill/attitude"" argument is ~~bullshit~~ improbable is the win rate. If we use any other ranking system (Elo/Glicko/whatever matchmaking system), a 90% winrate is expected from a top 5% player versus a completely average player. In Chess, that would be a 1500 player versus a 2200 player. In OW, that's a gold player vs a high master's player. 

What you are saying when you are justifying the win rate with ""skill difference"" is that if you took an average Horde player, he would be in the top 5% of all Alliance players.

That is an absolutely ludicrous proposition

The win rate, imo, is far too large to be ignored. The more people try to justify it with *feels* rather than numbers, the worse the problem becomes.

**TL;DR** The average Horde player is not a top 5% Alliance player which is the only way to justify the win rate difference by ""skill""",186,1583579907,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fetv6w/why_av_imbalance_is_a_system_issue/,classicwow,1

Well, a little background, I never actually played WoW before classic. I started playing with some friends when classic came out but they didn't really like the game that much, and eventually I stopped playing as well. I didn't get this far and I definitely didn't have gold for my mount. A month ago, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to give classic another try, and we started playing ago. We initially made 2 hunters, but I stopped at level 19 cause I wasn't really feeling it (he is still playing on his hunter and is level 41 now). I made a rogue for the first time and really liked it. Well, a few minutes ago I hit level 40 and had enough gold to buy not only 1 mount, but 2 if I wanted to lmao.

I know this isn't much, especially right now, but this is a big accomplishment for me, especially because I'm not really a hardcore gamer. Hope you guys can feel my hapiness a little bit :D",3,1583562907,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ferf1c/i_know_this_isnt_much_but_i_finally_hit_level_40/,classicwow,1

They all mount up and roll out while they graveyard is capped by the horde and the rest of the alliance team is set up to get farmed the rest of the map while people from x server kill the LTs. When the LTs are dead they will send out another raid warning that all LTs are dead and people from x server should afk and get ready for the next one. So basically what they do is waste 30 other people’s time and garuntee them a loss so they can get their honor and afk out. Thoughts on this?

felm6b,Same-Idea94,I killed a whole Guild when i was drunk.,"So i got a little story here... Before i get to the Title let me tell you the back story. Myself I run a guild. We are a casual fun guild ATM we are 6/8 and do MC ONY in 1.75Hours Nothing crazy but i am proud of it non the less. 

We Ended up getting both bindings few months back so i decided fuck it, Ill sell the ingots to get money to help with the TF for our tank. One night before i was to go out with my IRL buddies i decided to make some cash, Sell the ingots and my Ores from grinding and was going to send it to the Gbank Cause once BWL drops i want us to get TF ASAP. So i logged on when i came home completely Smashed.. I will also mention I am not a sloppy drunk by any means. Through the computer you would never tell i was Hammered behind the Drivers wheel that is my mouse and keyboard. I Hearth to Kargath go to my Mailbox and i earned about 3.5K From the ingots so I Sent it to the Gbank

This mage was outside making some cash for ports (the usual) I can't Remember how it exactly we started talking but we did, We chatted and talked and just compared stories for hours. Was a REAL heart to heart! Well so i thought, I was drunk after all. We were talking about Bis items and how hes like 200g away from Hide of the Wild ( on his Main ) Me, Myself, And I being so drunk and in a giving mood considering i just donated thousands of gold to our Gbank Which i am not in control of. To help this man out, I straight up Gave this guy 250G of my hard earn farmed money even though the damn fucking cloak costs like 400G on a bad day. He was SHOCKED.

 All i asked in return was Remember the name and spread the good name that my guild is... Like What in the fuck was i thinking... he took the gold bought his hide of the wild. Fast Forward 3 weeks BWL is out and i get a Random Whisper... ""Remember me"" i was like uhhh no. He links me the hide of the wild. I congratulated him and sorta went on about my business i was sort of shy since he didn't know i woke up with 15g left the next day lol My mistake After All. 

 He asked about our raids. our times. ETC, 10 minutes later, He whispered me said ""toss me an Ginvite"" i didn't think much of it. Until he gave me 6 more names to join... I was excited (guild Growing and all) they signed up for raid since a lot of our members quit and were burnt out. Almost every single one of them beat our top players.. I shortly found out they were in the top 4 Guild on the Server. They wanted a more chill experience they all did Nax in the past and just wanna have fun this time around and are just done with the competitive nature of a old game. They enjoyed there brief time here so much they got a few more of there buddies to come and join My Guilds doing better than ever! While the guild they left are struggling since i bought 10 members i guess you say

  i see them Pugging, Not even trying to compete about best times anymore and its sort of sad. I am still unsure if i should care or not! Regardless, Moral of the story. Get Drunk Give money away like your Floyd Mayweather and hope Karma comes and saves your ass like it did to mine.

I'm looking for some advice regarding my MH weapon. I'm a human sword rogue but our guild has seen very few 1H drops in MC, Ony and BWL so there are a lot of melee DPS high on the EPGP list starving for a 1H sword.

I'm wondering how much of an upgrade Claw of the Black Drake is over Krol Blade (if at all). I'm not good enough with math in this game to make a good call on this. Obviously I'm gaining a lot of top end dmg, however I'm losing the weapon skill which is a big loss in glancing blows.

fegh3a,fearghail281,Rogue Hit Cap Over 9% - What is the value after soft hit cap compared to agi/crit?,"Hey all,

  I am seeking some clarification on this topic, as the resources I'm finding online aren't quite clicking for me. For starters, I am a combat dagger rogue with ACLG and a crit chance hovering around 33% unbuffed. 

Last night I was awarded Boots of The Shadow Flame (I had T1). With that, my hit chance rose to 15%. I know that this might be considered ""too high"", but last week I also won Bloodfang Chestpiece which gave me an extra 2% as well (I had T1), so as far as my upgrades are going hit just seems to be on EVERYTHING in BWL and is unavoidable. I am eyeing the DFT pretty hard, and with no changes that would put me at 17%.

Obviously this affects my white damage and is still good to have but my question really is, how much should 1% hit be valued after the soft hit cap as opposed to agility/crit? The crit cap in relationship to my numbers and my weapon skill is a little confusing to me.

2. It means no Furious Howl for tanks/DPS.

3. Demo shout is objectively better if you want an AP reduction.

Rogue seems the natural choice - but end game Warriors seem to destroy the world if geared well enough. My gear prio will still be my mage so im not sure how viable it will be to get a warrior decked out well enough to fully utilize the dps potential.

In terms of playing - i actually enjoy both. Rogue has been a bit quicker to level - but so far it hasn't felt like a huge amount vs the warr. And have so far been funneling them both gold/gear

any casters alting these can  help with recommendation?",38,1583505356,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/feeb4e/best_melee_class_for_alt_help_me_decide_d/,classicwow,1

fee9tw,Tomthebom2010,The final stretch.,"When classic came out I made a paladin with some friends. A little butch drawf lass named Angis Thiccbottom. After reaching level 42 I put Ol Angis on the shelf because playing a paladin got awfully stale. So I rolled a Dwarf Priest named Meatstick. I got that fine lad to about 42 and then went on vacation for a few weeks for Christmas. I noticed that I was probably playing too much anyways because while shopping at the mall I was looking for peoples nameplates above their head and no one had it, until I realized I’m in the real world. 

Upon returning it took me awhile to get back into WoW. My friends kept on rolling, but they had a change of heart and switched to Horde. I wanted to start this adventure with them so I hopped back in. This time around I decided to roll a Druid and waste even more of my time. 

My druid is now level 53, and I’m actually really enjoying him. I like how you can approach and finesse your way differently on every encounter. I might not be the best at anything, but I can do everything. So on my last stretch to 60, I ask you, do I go heart of the wild or oath of clarity spec? And how is druid endgame? Should I just play my hunter instead?

I do want to raid eventually. I’d prefer dps but if I have to heal to get a spot and gear up then oh well. I enjoy tanking but as some one who has only raided a handful of times in TBC era I think It would be better for everyone to just not give me too much responsibility. I also really enjoy PvP.

fee1hv,freeCB,Current 50% win rate meta for Ally AV (EU),"Greetings,

I'm here to present you a start we are running with in the last couple of weeks and we sit on a comfortable 45-50% win rate (as ally :O).  


First I want to tell the hordes : Do not worry I change the tactic every week so even if you manage to understand the key disadvantages, this will be gone next week.  


I have attached a AV map where I have drawn what i'm about to explain now. [Link to the image](https://imgur.com/a/TtPrE6t)

In order for the ally pug to win a simple tactic should be followed. Most of the EU rankers know this,since we have been winning past week with it, but I want to share it to the rest and the new players.  


It is important to start the match by presenting the strat (spamming the premade macros) so that your teammates know that some1 is leading them. Most of the time this will make them more eager to win and bring them confidence. Next you need to follow this simple plan:

1. Tell all 100% mounts to follow you - the plan Is to stack behind the LEFT vehicle placed infront Balinda. We use the LEFT one because of how horde plays every game- they wait hard right and never expect us to pass between Balinda and SH Bunker.
2. Tell all 60% mounts to go to SH GY (you need atleast 7-8 for this to work) without leaving it.
3. Now back to the main group, as you see the horde rushing towards SH GY, wait for the first 5 man to pass, so they get slaughtered by your SH deffers + you fight less horde behind Balinda.
4. After the first 5 hordes have passed to SH GY, most probably the rest of the horde are waiting for you at field of strife and hard right of Balinda, that's when you get a massive advantage as Ally. Use this situation and command the group to follow you to SF GY, while killing most horde on the way.
5. When you get to SF comes the tricky part, you must wait for the horde and evaluate their movements =&gt; If horde goes north and only leave 10 ppl to come and attack you at SF you need to kill those and move ASAP to IB GY, leaving max 5-6 ppl @ SF GY to deff it. BUT if horde does not go north and decide to rush with 30-35 ppl SF GY and rest to go SH GY, you need to stay and deff SF until you have it. While having SH GY defending SF is easy so you need your 60% mount ppl to be @ SH GY.
6. When you get eventually to IB GY the game becomes a race who caps first and deffs better, so no start is needed apart from having mages to deff Vann and base while rest of the team is pushing.

What can go wrong and how to recover:

1. SH GY gets overrun and horde caps it =&gt; you must tell all your SH GY troops who will respawn in SP to push to SH and try recap while you guys are fighting for SF. Most of the time horde will go all in for SF and leave only 6-7 to deff the capped SH GY. Now since they only have IB GY it will be easy for SH deffers to recap it back while the horde is zerging SF.
2. SF GY gets overrun and horde caps it =&gt; when this happens you MUST MOVE asap hard left to IB GY (behind SH Bunker) while the horde is regrouping @ SF and getting rdy for balinda/SH GY push
3. SF GY is overrun + SH GY is overrun, both capped and IB GY is horde controlled =&gt; This is the worst case scenario. When it comes to this you will either be flamed by your whole group until you decide to tell them ""FUk off"" and /afk. Try not to leave and command the druids and rogues to move SOUTH and kill all LTs without capping towers or GYs.
4. You have SF GY and you see SH GY but your team cannot push to IB GY and they prefer killing LTs and dying @ galv then cap IB GY. This is a bad situation to be in, but the advantage is that the horde is already demoralised and seem to be trying to deff and not push north. To avoid this send your rogues and druids to ninja cap IB GY while the main group fights them off and push to IB GY
5. You are pushing south ,everything is under control, you have time advantage and someone in your group wants to summon AV boss you get more honor etc. NEVER EVER send your main group back to summon the boss while you are pushing. This will, in 90 % of the cases, resolve in horde pushing the rest out of IB GY and killing the boss after while it is not buffed.

fed4mn,RockMeetHardPlaces,https://www.epgp.net,"So, I made a thing.  Some EPGP users might be familiar with [epgpweb.com](https://epgpweb.com) (last updated c. 2010) -- this website is more or less a replacement of that (a place to upload [EPGP Classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/epgp-classic) backups, out of game viewing, etc).  It comes with a very simple Discord bot and I have plans on expanding the feature set.

For now this is entirely coupled with Discord as it assumes your guild uses it (which is a fair assumption these days).  I might add a non-Discord login option if enough people want it, but for now it's Discord only.

At this point, I think it's ready for some more users other than my own guild.  I'm sure there's bugs - please let me know all about them!  Also, if you have a feature request, I'm all eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

Future plans:

* Discord Webhook: similar to how [warcraftlogs.com](https://warcraftlogs.com) works, [epgp.net](https://epgp.net) will post in a specific channel every time a new backup is uploaded.
* Alexa skill (no kidding, I'm doing this -- mostly for fun on my part, but it's happening)
* Customized guild URLs (atm it uses the discord guild id)
* Export Upload from other EPGP addons (I know there's at least one other EPGP addon out in the wild - it'd be nice to work with that one as well.)
* Possibly adding more permissions to things -- right now if you have MANAGE\_GUILD or ADMIN permissions on the discord server, you can fully manage the EPGP stuff.

fe4i71,enigma-90,Guildie's account hacked - how?,"Someone hacked a guildie's account a day ago. I'm trying to figure out how.

He said he got one of the ""please visit X or you will be suspended"" whispers (he has a screenshot). He clicked on the link in-game, which was possible due to a wow addon that he had (I see on the screenshot that the link is clickable). He said that he had an addon that would open the link in the browser. It wasn't one of those addons that simply let you copy the link inside a new window.

After clicking the link, he got blocked almost immediately with a message saying that this email doesn't have any licenses or something, meaning that the attacker or the program quickly changed his email on the battle net account.

Blizzard restored the account within a day, but not everything, and he lost tons of stuff in the mail.

First of all,  if this is all true, I'm amazed that it is even possible for wow classic addons to open links in a web browser. Does anyone know such addon? He deleted it and doesn't remember the name.  

Second, I used to think people get ""hacked"", simply because they entered all the login details at a sketchy website. While what he did wasn't smart, if you have up-to-date Windows 10 and Chrome, you typically should be safe even after going to some website. It seems to be something more advanced and could be a vulnerability related to Blizzard, because a critical zero-day vulnerability in Chrome or Windows costs or can get you probably at least $100k+. Sadly, that link is dead, and I can't inspect the website's code and see what it did.",1,1583452081,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fe4i71/guildies_account_hacked_how/,classicwow,1

I can't stand the whining of bad North American alliance players who whine about 1% Alliance win rate in AV.

I play AV exlusively and I queue as part of a 5 man premade about half of time in AV. In this instance, as you can tell by the names, there were three 5 man premades in the game, an Arabic, Greek and Scandinavian premade. We stomped the Horde really good.

fe38rr,smoketrickz,How I traded Pocket Lint worth 1 copper for 1k gold.,"To start this off let me explain how it started. I am pretty well of in gold on my main server Benediction-Horde but I have been bored with the game so i decided to test my gold making skills and start on a new server with nothing but a piece of Pocket Lint and remain level 1 and trade my way to 1k gold. I found a server i have never played on and found someone to give me a \[Pocket Lint\] from a dusty tome worth exactly 1c. Has no value in the game.

So there were rules i made to keep this fair.

1. I could not tell someone what i was doing.
2. I could not trade with people in my guild.
3. I could not use services in the guild such as professions / ports.
4. I could not level at all, so no professions.

I predicted to my friends it would take me 3 days /played to make it to 1k, but i finished at 1d 21h 7m.

The server i chose was Heartseeker - Alliance

Here is the spreadsheet so you can follow along to the story.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cEwBAxCiQ6ByaN3smCKPA-FQTwUXAj5FrVO2fHVrleg/edit#gid=229218395](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cEwBAxCiQ6ByaN3smCKPA-FQTwUXAj5FrVO2fHVrleg/edit#gid=229218395)

Honestly the start was the hardest, selling Pocket Lint with no value was very hard, so i just tried to make people laugh. I can play the auction house pretty well and make gold pretty quickly but it requires capital. Takes money to make money! So i used this method to make it to about 50g by selling cats, then i started to take it more serious. In hindsight i wish i would have just done real trades 1g - 50g and i did do some, but over all i meme'd I 100% know i could have done this part without it, but it was much faster this way. Here is an example of what i did to get to 50g [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOLbYxy0-Q&amp;t=23s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOLbYxy0-Q&amp;t=23s)

Once i hit 50g it was pretty much almost 100% trading from that point on, I think i ditched 1 more cat along the way lol.

You may be wondering how i bought / sold items or why i bought the items i did.

I have played on private servers for a long time + i just have a good general knowledge of what items are going to sell fast and what a good price to buy them is. I used this with my custom TSM addon to do this project.

I did everything i could to find good purchases, i would check the AH probably 100 times a day for good buys, if i wasn't finding them, i would find items on the AH and see who is selling it and shoot them a whisper asking to sell at a cheaper price, this works more often than you would think, People just want their gold sooner than later, so instead of paying AH posting cost / fees they will sell for 20-30% cheaper to you.

I basically lived in trade chat, almost 100% of the big items i sold where from selling in trade chat and there is a couple of reasons why.

1. As soon as you pay whatever amount of money to post your auction, someone will probably undercut you so you wasted money posting an auction that now will probably not sell.
2. When you undercut, all you are doing is lowering the value of your item if it doesn't sell.

So what i would do is look for good items, but not only good items, good items that there were only 1-3 of. So if there was 2 Underworld Bands for example on AH, i would whisper both people, offer much less than they were asking for, then if i got it, i would sell in trade chat for less than the other guy who didn't sell it to me. This works even better when one is on the AH for 110g and the other for 130g, that tells me that he is wanting gold quick, so i low ball it, get the on for 110g for 80g then spam trade chat with "" Selling Underworld Band 100g much cheaper than AH"" since the one on AH is 30g more it sells very fast and i make 20g profit.

Obviously this doesn't work all the time, i was told no a million times on this journey, but i still made it!

If i was stuck with an item that i got a good deal on, and was not getting an hits in trade chat, i would literally run around and inspect people in ironforge to see if it was an upgrade and then try to sell it to them if it was. I sold a good amount of T1 pieces of gear this way.

If none of the above worked, i would try to trade the item + gold to someone to get an easier item to sell fast. But i still always did the math and made a profit! :\]

I found the best time to buy items was between 6am-8am and 3pm-4pm

The best time to sell items for me personally was 8pm-11pm

It wasn't always sunshine and rainbows through this journey, at multiple points i wanted to quit. The biggest thing for me is ""Why am i doing this"" at the end i will have 1k gold on a server i don't play on!? And also i have a lot of gold on the server i do play on because i keep at it, i basically took a 2 week break from my main server to do this, so the biggest thing is like god, i could have made 7-8x this gold just farming on my 60 mage and 60 hunter in the 45 hours this took. But i kept going and i'm glad i did.

The people i met along the way were amazing, i became friends with some cool people just hanging out in SW / IF all day. I want to give a shout out to Wruciraptor, Ushala and Bigguyy. Super cool people that had no idea what i was doing but were always nice to me and cool to talk to!

But not everyone was great, i did have the most toxic experience i have ever had in WoW as well. You can see here, i reported him. [https://imgur.com/gallery/S6T1uih](https://imgur.com/gallery/S6T1uih)

Anyways i am glad this is over and i don't really know what i will do with the 1k just yet, but if you have an questions please reach out and let me know, i will do my best to reply to them all!

Thank you for reading!

fe2z35,popshicles,Foolproof Step-by-Step Guide to Stacking Consumables and World Buffs (Alliance),"1. Check prices of potions/flasks/food consumables on AH.
2. Experience sticker shock about the exorbitant price, choose to wait.
3. Farm the mats for whichever Blasted Lands quest consumable is best for your class. This will take ages because the mobs are camped 24 hours a day.
4. Wait a few days, then buy all of the aforementioned consumables for twice the price they were when you checked them the first time.
5. Travel to DM, post in general chat “WTB DM Buffs.” Buy DM buffs from a hunter whose only english is “5g” and “come.”
6. Hearth to SW.  Pay a mage to port you to Darnassus, then fly to Felwood to look for Cleansed Songflower.
7. Get ganked in Felwood by no-life horde neckbeards.
8. Repeat steps 4-6 until you locate a Corrupted Songflower and realize you do not have any Salve to cleanse the Corrupted Songflower.
9. Realize that you need to do a quest chain to obtain the aforementioned Salve.
10. Do the quest chain while your DM buffs expire.
11. Again repeat steps 4-6.
12. Locate Songflower, discover that it has been looted sometime in the past 30 minutes.
13. Logout to conserve buffs.
14. Periodically log in and out until  a) you are able to cleanse the Songflower. Hearth to SW and proceed to step 15 OR b) it is raid time. Hearth to SW and proceed to step 18.
15. Log out until its time for Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer.
16. Log in for Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer buff and either a) rejoice because you got the last of your World buffs! Proceed to step 17.  OR b) curse because you missed it by seconds. Log out until raid time to conserve your other buffs. Proceed to step 18.
17. Logout until raid time to conserve buffs. 
18. Raid time! Head to Blackrock mountain and a) get ganked by no-life horde neckbeards on your way to BRM, lose buffs. Start over at step 1 next week OR b) miraculously survive your perilous journey thru BRM. Proceed to step 19.
19. Participate as little as possible in trash fights because you are terrified of pulling aggro and dying.
20. Before the first boss pull pop all of the potion/flask/food/Blasted Lands consumables you spent your entire supply of gold to acquire.
21. Pull aggro and die immediately.  Start over at step 1 next week",42,1583445744,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fe2z35/foolproof_stepbystep_guide_to_stacking/,classicwow,1

fe1vcb,Chernoobyl,A shout out to the Min/Maxers and the Tryhards,"Despite all the negatives I see on here towards you, I think you deserve a shout out and a thanks for spending your free time making your character the best it can be.

Those mana pots, nightfins, and dark runes you farmed help keep your mana up thus letting the tank stay alive longer, those health pots, whipper roots, protection pots, FAPs...etc help keep you in the fight longer easing the tension on the healers and allowing them to focus on the tanks more, all those dps consumes you farmed help the bosses die a lot faster and helps the raid night go much quicker for everyone. All those rare, expensive, and rep gated profession recipes you acquired to benefit the guild. And all those world buffs you spent time getting are a major overall net positive for all 40 people's raid night, including those who spent no time min/maxing.

The time spent combing over BiS lists and going out and farming the gear night after night to bring your A game to the raid makes the different between a night of wiping and a night of succeeding. The guild leaders who spent their free time going over strats and relaying them to your guild, answering questions, and making sure everyone is on the same page is appreciated too. The loot council or DKP accountants making sure loot is being handed out in the most fair, beneficial, and efficient way - spending your own time doing a non-fun task to help out everyone. 

You spend your limited free time making sure you are an asset not a burden, making sure you come as prepared as possible to do the maximum amount of healing/tanking/dpsing, you spend your time making sure you aren't holding anyone back, and making sure the raid night goes as smooth and efficient as possible for everyone involved. You spend your time running the guild and it's essential components making the raids possible for everyone in the first place. You spend your time farming the gold to get the enchanting and alchemy recipes that everyone benefits from.

Classic is really my first experience with WoW - and I leveled a Druid as my first 60.

I leveled as feral DPS and rolled feral tank for a long while. Ever since finding a raid guild I like, ive tried every flavor from HotW/NS, Moonkin, and am currently resto. 

One thing I can’t help but notice is a weird amount of hate for boomkins. I can understand not wanting one in a raid slot - perhaps you simply prefer another caster over the spell crit buff. 

But even in the open world, I notice this stuff. I was in a BRD spam pug with a boomkin guildie of mine - and the whole run was full of constant “jokes” whenever the melee would die and mention they’d “thought the 3% crit would save [them]!”

Like I said - I get not necessarily wanting to roll boomkin yourself, or not wanting one in a raid slot - but why does it seem like so many people give a shit about what character someone else is playing for their own fun?",174,1583434681,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fe02ef/whats_with_the_boomkin_hate/,classicwow,1

fdwqt1,SneakyGoo5e,Blizzard needs to address the coming AQ gates crisis,"With the AQ event on the horizon, there are several servers with giant skews of Horde to Alliance.  

Source: https://ironforge.pro/servers/?filter=true&amp;server=us​

Pagle - 7600 players 82% alliance
Skeram - 5880 players 91% horde
Stalagg - 5000 players, 99.9% horde
Heartseeker - 5200 players, 90% alliance
Thalnos - 1600 players, 91% horde


Now, Blizzard has two viable options to address this looming problem.

1.  #Nochanges. Servers without a healthy amount of both players on both factions, will not be able to open their respective gates anywhere close to other servers. Might take a month or more for servers to finally open the gates.

The Result? There will be a mass transferring of guilds to other servers, causing potentially higher ques, and an even greater population skew on somewhat healthy servers.  Just alone, on Stalagg, for example - there are over 40 horde guilds that are 8/8 BWL. That's minimum 1600 players that will be looking to transfer to another server.

2. Some type of change to allow one server to open up their own gate.  I'm not sure what that answer is. Maybe just allow one faction, to turn in the total required resources pool (alliance + horde). 

Regardless, there needs to at least be a statement for what Blizzard is planning to do.  If it's no changes? So be it. Give the hundreds of guilds time to pick a server they will be moving to and be done with it.  Not to mention a bunch of extra cash for $ATVI's bottom line.  All we are asking for is a comment on what to expect.",37,1583421732,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fdwqt1/blizzard_needs_to_address_the_coming_aq_gates/,classicwow,1

Having 35% critchance fully buffed only applies to trash apparently, as soon as you hit the bosses your critrate goes down to like 8-15% critchance for some completely unknown reason 90% of the time.

Due to having no threat management at all the difference between being close to pulling aggro and being careful can be top 5 dps spot (When RNG is actually in your favour which is like 10% of the time at best) and being at the last spots on the damage meters, like there is no inbetween half the time.

Atleast I'm enjoying PvP, well not quite accurate either, it's fun while your fighting, its not fun while half your time pvp'ing is just you preparing to pvp, like gathering soulshards, having all your shit up like your buffs, healthstone, soulstone, juggling between your pets, drinking mana.

fdrzip,zenojis,Lets get Discord's phone verification problems fixed.,"[https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360057959511-Fix-Phone-Verification](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360057959511-Fix-Phone-Verification)

I am someone that only started using Discord recently since it's what other WoW players are using. I know a lot of gamers have been using it for a while, I've just never had a reason to. I've noticed a number of people having issues with account verification. Most people seem to not have many issues, but it seems that a minority of people have a rough time with discord. I suspect more people would have problems, except many people will simply uninstall a program like Discord once problems come up and never say anything about it. I feel locked into Discord since most of the server I play on uses it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I posted a [thread](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360057959511-Fix-Phone-Verification)on the Discord feedback website to hopefully get attention from Discord towards fixing issues they have with their verification system. I'm trying to focus on the purely economic and technical side of the issues. I know many people are ideologically opposed to giving any personal information to a company like Discord and that's fine, but I think that their phone verification system goes beyond that. There are plenty of people that simply don't have a phone number which Discord will accept, and Discord has grown to a point where it's becoming very frustrating because people cannot decide to leave the platform over verification issues (because they'd have to bring entire communities with them). Hopefully we can get Discord to fix the problems rather than having people constantly work around the problems.

fdrci1,Rokhiani,The simple mistake that turned modern WoW into a game of convenience,"Someone suggested I repost this without any criticism of modern WoW.

A lot of people don't want any changes to WoW Classic because they look at modern WoW and don't trust Blizzard to get any changes to Classic right.

But the truth is that the community failed WoW just as much as Blizzard did — by not catching a mistake that Blizzard made, that made leveling too easy for new players and eventually influenced the tuning of the endgame.

In late 2010, with the 4.0.1 system changes patch for Cataclysm, Blizzard [removed spell ranks from all abilities](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_4.0.1#Classes:_General).

This had an unintended effect: low-level content became much too easy. Blizzard might have made a few changes to mobs or low-level abilities to compensate, but the fundamental problem remained: **Blizzard had got the math wrong for base damage at low levels**.

As Blizzard [confirmed](https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408129439516471296), up until base damage was [removed entirely](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Stat_squish) in 2014, the base damage of two abilities would stay at a constant ratio all the way to the level cap.

Those who understand spell coefficients in WoW should see why this was a problem. Spells scale at vastly different rates. It takes roughly 9000 spellpower to double the damage output of Hellfire, with just a [2.2%](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/) coefficient, and 3600 to double the damage of Blizzard, but only about 500 spellpower to double the damage of Shadow Bolt. Coefficients [changed](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_power_coefficient?oldid=1087228) with later expansions, but there was generally a need for poorly-scaling abilities to gain more base damage from new spell ranks to make up for the lack of scaling from gear.

A few types of abilities scaled especially poorly: tanking abilities like Shield Slam, and damage absorption shields like Power Word: Shield.

When spell ranks were removed, abilities common to a class all began to scale at the same rate. Furthermore, Blizzard did almost all of its balancing for the level cap, and tanks suffered from not scaling as fast as DPS so Blizzard would regularly buff the base damage of tanking abilities so tanks could keep up in threat.

**An example, since some people just don't get it:**

In WotLK, Rank 12 Renew, obtained at lvl 70, did [1110 healing](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Renew&amp;oldid=2293887). Rank 12 Power Word: Shield, also obtained at lvl 70, [absorbed 1265 damage](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Power_Word:_Shield&amp;diff=2325459&amp;oldid=2256892). Ratio: 0.877.

Rank 14 Renew, obtained at lvl 80, did 1400 healing. Rank 14 PWS absorbed 2230 damage. Ratio: 0.627.

If you made the ratio of base healing the same at every level, as Blizzard did, you can't match the effect of multiple ranks.

Blizzard changed some spell coefficients in Cata, though, and I can't find data for PWS's base damage, so I'll use Flash Heal and Renew.  In early Cata, with data from wiki edits on the same date,

Lvl 60 Renew [ticked for 436](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Renew&amp;oldid=2702656) and had a spell coefficient of 13.1%. So it would double with 436 / 0.131 = 3328 spellpower.

Lvl 60 Flash Heal [healed 2234 to 2596](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Flash_Heal&amp;oldid=2702457), with a coefficient of 60.4%. So it would double with (2234 + 2596) / 2 / 0.604 = 3998 spellpower.

The huge jump in base damage around lvl 57/58 was a symptom of the broken process, where base damage was likely somehow calculated from the expected gear of a typical character. If they had done it right, this might have been fine, but they didn't. (If you don't think a lvl 60 character going from healing for 900 to healing for 2500 with the same spell made leveling easier, I don't know what's wrong with you. ""It was just less tedious"" doesn't cut it.)

Abilities that did a percentage of weapon damage also become stupidly overpowered at some point, as a single white swing did less of a character's total health at the level cap than at lvl 60, but I don't know if this happened around the same time. A lot of long-time players probably just assumed that leveling was really easy because they were using Heirlooms, which gave you a weapon with 10 dps or something at lvl 1, when a new player would have a 0.9 dps Worn Dagger.

The result was that classes typically had several abilities that were completely overpowered at low levels — ""charge and two-shot same-level mobs"" overpowered. This happened at the same time that Blizzard made max-level dungeons [much harder](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/2053469/wow-dungeons-are-hard). (Blizzard's post that defended the harder dungeon difficulty got over 8000 comments in two days and eventually generated over 16,000 comments, some of which can still be seen on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20111222094001/http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2053469#comments) or [Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/news=179780/ghostcrawler-dungeons-are-hard#comments).) New players did not learn to play since leveling was so easy, and when they got to max level groups would kick them for failing in the hard dungeons.

This was the start of WoW becoming easy. Raids were nerfed several months later, and LFR came later the same year.

fdk5dy,avalidname,AV rep turn-ins no longer contribute to entire factions post AV exalted.,"Apologizes for the Alliance-centric post. I'm curious if Horde players have experienced something similar as well.


Until you reach 999/1000 Exalted with either Stormpike or Frostwolf factions, all turn in contribute to your reputation with these factions. 

*(i.e. 5x Storm Crystals would contribute 50 Stormpike Rep. = 10 rep per crystal)*

However once you do reach 999/1000 Exalted, those AV turn-ins begin to progress reputation with the AV race represented from your base starting (Alliance or Horde) factions. 

*(i.e. 5x Storm Crystals contributed 50 Ironforge Rep = 10 rep per crystal)*


Upon reaching 999/1000 with the AV represented race, turn-in then contribute to other base alliance or horde races. 

As of at least a few months ago, reputation gained from turn-ins was evenly distributed across the 3 other races. 

*(i.e. 5x Storm Crystals contributed 12.5 reputation to Alliance, which is 50/4. 50 rep/5 = 10 rep per crystal, [Why it would still contribute to IF, I don't know])*


Then it became only Stormwind. 

*(i.e. 5x Storm Crystals contributed 50 Stormwind Rep= 10 rep per crystal)*


But now, it turn-ins only contribute to my character's race, and only that portion with would be indicative of reputation being split among multiple race factions. (i.e.  5x Storm Crystals contributed 12.5 = 2.5 rep per crystal).


So what gives? Why the reputation nerf for turn-ins? Was this even deliberate? Did I miss changes regarding this?",5,1583357497,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fdk5dy/av_rep_turnins_no_longer_contribute_to_entire/,classicwow,1

fdj7g6,Mikerinokappachino,Guild officer / Guild Master's paradox.,"I feel like generally speaking the playerbase's view on guild officers and guild masters are at odds with their expectations and thought it could be a good topic of discussion for the community. 

The playerbase expects officers and guild masters in positions of leadership and power to receive no real tangible benefit. There are scores of examples of people on this subreddit that routinely make the implication that an officer in their guild only got a piece of loot because they are in a position of power. They are expected to do their officer duties and if they have any sort of benefit to that the playerbase calls it corruption. 

Guild leadership is also expected to perform many additional tasks and responsibilities related to guild management, loot / guild drama, recruitment, logging items / attendance / other things on sheets, prepare strategies for raids, ect ect. 

The paradox, and I'm not sure if that's the proper terminology here, is that if we expect guild leadership to perform all of this extra tasks and extra work, how is it fair to then expect them to receive no benefit to this work. 

I feel the playerbase's attitude to this has the effect that it pushes anyone away from leadership who has any sense at all. No sensible person would sign up for all this extra work at literally no benefit to themselves. 

What ends up happening in my opinion is that leadership positions that have no tangible benefit then begin to attract people who want the *intangible* benefit that comes with power. The ability to tell people what to do and have some limited power over them. It's exactly the kind of person you *don't* want running things. 


My question to the community is: Is this the proper stance to take with guild leadership? Is the community not at least in part responsibly for the seemingly rampant leadership corruption in WoW?",244,1583353870,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fdj7g6/guild_officer_guild_masters_paradox/,classicwow,1

So like many people (I Assume) I've become sick of the 2hr queues on Firemaw on Raid days and am looking to transfer.

My problem is I have 93% attendance rate and i always show up to raid at 8:00 which is earlier then alot of people ,do fairly good dps but they decided to invite the newer members over me and invite people that have to leave mid raid.  The guild stresses importance of attendance yet invite people who have lower attendance then me. They told me they promised to have a spot for my next week raid. Do you guys think I'm overrating in wanting to look for another guild or should I wait till next week to make a decision or wait till next week to make a decision?",5,1583351052,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fdihsn/guild_took_new_members_with_me_over_newer_members/,classicwow,1

Are the alliance dominated PVE servers (NA) and specifically Pagle server overpopulated when it comes to leveling and farming? I have been putting off moving from PVP to PVE server for fear that PVE might die one day and there’s no way back. But I am just so tired of the ridiculous runs into BRM, the griefers, and the overall bad mannered players on PVP servers. 

I want to switch but I’m kind of worried there will be so many people trying to farm resources in the open world that none will be available and I’ll actually be screwing myself just in a different way.

Am I clearing it wrong, it was especially the pack in the middle when going up to the second guard? Do I need to kill the pack furthest to the right so they respawn as hostile, or arent they supose to spawn as hostiles at all? Also had the mobs down the hallway respawn as hostiles?

I love WoW and I loved playing classic but something just didn’t feel right. I guess I stopped playing with roommate as much. I think we ran 2 dungeons together at 60 but leveled up to 60 almost entirely together. 

I really wish I didn’t bail before the PVP but now I’m leaving for basic training and I’m just going to miss everything. Best case scenario I get to play catch up but that just doesn’t sound fun.

fdb5ee,jh2288,Raid Geared rogue Seeking new guild on a new server (Alliance PvP) Details inside," I'm a rogue that's in a guild that has been farming Molten Core consistently but with BWL coming out we have had issues keeping a roster and we are not progressing through BWL.  

 I have nearly max gear from MC and I have both vis'kags and brutality blade.  I'm seeking a guild with a more laid back atmosphere that can clear 8/8 of BWL.  I teach in real life so i know the importance of being teachable and i'm always seeking ways to improve myself and i'm always willing to not only listen, but hoping to find people who want to help me improve.  I can do 500-600 dps on most fights, excluding fights like Vaelestraz where the dps is a bit funky.  

 My guild does not collect logs however so i would not be able to link my logs to back up this, so i would understand if any guild i join would only be as a trial basis.  

 My only hard and fast requirement is that raid times are during Weekends or late night (PST)  as those are the times that fit with my work schedule. If your guild is looking for geared plug-and-play melee DPS send me a message! 

Thanks in advance,

fdaubk,Sushi_Lad,The most efficient way to use DKP?," I haven't been able to find any information online about strategies to use DKP most efficiently, most of the responses are just people shitting on DKP guilds. I'm a casual and I'm quite happy with the loot system so I'm not looking to be convinced otherwise.

Does anyone have any specific strategies on how they use their DKP? We earn 67 DKP per week with a decay of 10%. Some of the things I've thought about are as follows...    


1. Saving the most DKP in your class to guarantee to win rare drops. Drawbacks would be losing more DKP while you wait for those rare drops through more DKP decay per week.   
2. Spending your DKP as fast as you can on everything that drops to reduce overall DKP decay over time due to only ever having small quantities.   
3. Holding DKP while others spend lots when the competition is high after a while item becomes cheap and you spend less to pick up lots of items quickly.  It depends on if your savings on those items is higher than your total DKP decay while you wait.   


I'm aware lots of this is highly dependent on how much competition within your guild there is for gear etc, along with everyone has different DPS priority list, and if you've only got a couple of items on your list your strategy would be very different to someone who has many.

fd8r05,ExponentialHS,"BRD, you beautiful disaster","I’m not sure what coke-fueled fever dream BRD sprang out of, but it’s a wild ride every time I go there. Jamming 50 bosses (literally) into a labyrinth that can be navigated in an endless number of ways was truly a stroke of genius, or just the side-effect of a stroke. 

Tonight, I took my 59 rogue into BRD with a 55 warrior, 60 Druid, 57 warlock, and 58 hunter. Two members happily provided it was their first time there. Emperor Thaurassian rested easy tonight my friends. 

We wiped not once, not twice, but thrice on the way to Bael’Gar. Why were we killing him?  Who the fuck knows. After some coercion, we established that the warlock would seduce and hunter would freezing trap. Our efficiency improved and we killed Roccor and did the Arena. Things were looking up until we reached Angerforge, whose adds promptly wiped us. 

Our hunter dropped party and I was fairly relieved by the prospect our group would end. But then his friend said he was just switching to his protection Paladin. With two tanks (the warrior kept his shield on), we safely if slowly cleared Angerforge and Argelmach to the Grim Guzzler (killing Ribbly and Hurley). We knocked out Incendius, the Hall of Crafting, Black Vault, and Domicile. Finally, in a bit of backtracking, we found ourselves back near the Ring of Law and killed Pryomancer Loregrain before calling it quits. 

Our group really coalesced. The warlock was hitting banishes and seduces on pulls. The warrior taunting mobs off the druid and interrupting heals. . The paladin DI’d the druid to save a wipe. We might not have saved the Princess, but she didn’t really want saving to begin with. 

After everyone turned in, I tried my hand at lava jumping to the MC entrance. I’m not sure what maniac discovered this was possible, but it was not for me. Armor broken, I died with my body suspended in mid-air, in sight of my destination.

fd6wpx,Dontusethisname1,Why do a lot of healers have a god complex?,"I've played all 3 roles heavily as my main role for different expansions mostly just to be versatile but it's fun to do different things at time. However it seems that people who main ONLY healer seem to have some sort of inherent god complex. As if their role is the only one vital to the success of anything. While it's true they're important so is everyone else... Then when I read posts like ""why I didn't heal you - out of spite"" that's just ridiculous and quite frankly cringy. There are a lot of tanks and dps are bad, but just as many healers are straight up bad too. For example I can't count how many healers since launch I've ran into that haven't trained past rank 1 resurrect, like is that 5g you saved really worth ressing people at 100hp so that they have 0 chance of surviving a mechanic in case something else goes south (Also news flash if you weren't aware, all ranks of res cost the same amount of mana). Just play your role, I've had like 3 bad experiences since the beginning of classic, all the healers complaining tanks/dps are pulling like mad men constantly are HIGHLY exaggerated I play far more than the average person and in all those hundreds of groups I've been in THREE bad experiences (where people were being straight up toxic and the run was terrible).

fd645d,SoupaSoka,r/ClassicWoW changes e.g. the memes have won and new discussion stickies,"Hi all,

As you may recall, we opted for a “low-mod” state a few weeks ago. This was partially a test and a way for us to get effective feedback and data about the community and the content it is creating, and partially because we thought y’all would fuck up the sub and we wanted you to burn at your own hands (jk, sorta).

Here’s what we plan to enact going forward on a permanent basis:

1. All memes are allowed, regardless of quality, on any day of the week, as long as they’re related to WoW Classic either by the post’s title, the meme’s image, or text within the meme (basically, Rule #1). We won’t be removing memes for “low-effort” as we had done some months back before we enacted the Sunday-only meme rule.

2. We were a bit lax these past few weeks on Rule #2 (personal attacks, insults, etc). We’ll be reverting to our standard level of enforcement for this. That basically means, don’t be an asshat.

3. We’ve removed the AutoMod filter that required your post had at least 75 characters. Wanna make a title-only text post? Go for it! We’ve loosened up a few other obscure AutoMod filters as well, though we’ve left some of the more flagrant ones in-place (e.g., most common words that would be considered sexist/racist/etc. will still be autofiltered).


The only other change we’re making is that we will more regularly be creating short 3-to-4 day long discussion topics as stickies, focusing on various aspects of WoW Classic. We used to run 4 Day Chats that people seemed to like, and these will be quite similar. Since we only have two sticky slots, one of those will always be reserved for the Daily Questions Megathread, Mondays will be for the LFG sticky, and Fridays will be for the Class-focused discussions. With that in mind, our new discussion series will likely run Tuesday through Thursdays. **If you have an idea for a topic to include in this upcoming series, please comment with it below.** We’ll generate a large list of topics and rotate through them overtime.

To those of you that miss the old sub pre-memes, I’m sincerely sorry. We’ve battled back and forth about this for literally months and years, going from allowing all memes to allowing only non-“low-effort” memes to allowing memes on Sundays only to now allowing all memes once again. There is no perfect solution, but we think this plan is the best overall regarding total activity on the sub, simplicity/ease for the user-base, stress on the moderators, and based on feedback from users overall. I would encourage you to dig into some of the meme posts: just because there’s a stupid meme macro as the post itself doesn’t mean there aren’t good discussions occurring within the comment sections. I’d also encourage you to keep an eye out for our new discussion stickies.

With that, thank you for your time and patience while we ran this experiment the last few weeks. I know a lot of you thought this would have been better from the get-go and we resisted that idea, but going through the trial left us mostly in agreement. Thanks for bearing with us. If you have any questions or thoughts, comment below and we'll do our best to respond to them all over the next couple of days.

fd5m1m,howdre,Hunters 7+ damage scope vs +3% hit scope,"Hey guys!

I didn't saw this being discussed much, but with the upcoming ZG release and 1% (2% if double) hit enchant, many hunters might want to switch out hit scope with damage scope. For anyone interested, here's comparison:

  
**Damage scope** offers +7 flat damage to your shots. This means each shot in your rotation will do excactly 7 bonus damage if your target has 0 armor. Now if you take the case of Rhok'delar, where your rotation consists mainly of 1 Aimed, 1 Multi and \~3 Auto shots, that makes approximately 35 extra damage on 10 seconds window of your rotation (that is if target has 0 armor). So basically it only scales with critical strike. So even with 30% crit, that value is on average around 5 dps increase.

**Hit scope** on other hand is 3% hit for Ranged weapons. There is no direct value to convert %hit to dps, but you usually exchange items with +%hit with items that have either same %crit or similar value in stats like AP or agility. This means the +3% hit you don't need to get from items can be replaced by other offensive stats (AP, Agility, Crit) in numbers that definately exceed flat 5 dps.

**Conclusion:** Don't replace your +3% hit scope with +7 damage, unless your hit is REALLY high above the hitcap (like 12%), as the damage scope offers really minor dps upgrade compared to hit scope's indirect dps increase potential.",32,1583286756,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fd5m1m/hunters_7_damage_scope_vs_3_hit_scope/,classicwow,1

fd2m4f,Dingding12321,Fellow 60 dps Shamans: what're y'all's takes on this PvE/PvP talent brew?,"https://imgur.com/gallery/NjD7mHa

It's similar to the old 18/30something  build floating around WoWHead but emphasizes weaving max-rank Shocks and Bolts.

27/24 ele/enh

Ele talents:

Max Reverberation, Devastation; 2 points into Lightning Mastery - enough to weave in Shocks every 4.1s (2.6 + 1.5 GCD) - then swap to melee dps after proccing Devastation/Clearcasting or pulling threat.  Omits Storm Reach.

Enh talents:

Max Flurry, Elemental Weapons.  Max Shield Block plus a point into Parry for solo/PvP.  Doesn't reach Weapon Mastery or Stormstrike.

It misses out on Stormstrike outside of raids and weapon dps from the end of Enh, as well as the cheaper totems, the totem reach (still attainable with 3 pieces of the MC set), buffed regen totems and hit% talents (granted crits matter more than plain hits) from Resto, and the 2.0s Bolts and guaranteed spell crit every 3m from Ele.  

What it retains, however, is 2x crits on spells and spell effects, Flurry, Elemental Weapons and two casts every 4.1s within 20 yards alternating between Bolt/Shock, plus Devastation and Clearcasting Chain Lightning or a Shock while weaving autos as payoffs.  It also keeps every offensive stat relevant, making most any endgame dps gear viable.  It can opt for Flametongue solo or in dungeons if one's gear collectively gives more Int/spell damage than Str/Agi, granted WF will always be best in a party with a Warrior tank.  

As someone with only one piece of BiS gear that is still currently saving up for their mount, the flexibility of these talents has me drooling in anticipation.  From what I understand there's way more Ele gear in Classic than Enh; odds are I'll stumble upon a lot of it and would love to be able to make use of it - I'm likely to get a lot of it too since most of the shamans in my guild will pass on the MC set as they already have it themselves or have something even better.  My current talents are Enh/Resto.  

I'll be pulling the trigger and switching to these either tonight or later this week and will let y'all know how it goes.",17,1583273868,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fd2m4f/fellow_60_dps_shamans_whatre_yalls_takes_on_this/,classicwow,1

fd2jps,Vanillaisclassic,"Chinese farmers, lotus and classic","Hi everyone,

After seeing a recent post a few days ago about the Chinese farmers and bots that farm, I was inspired to make this post. After months of reports from numerous people, along with submitting a master report, Blizzard refuses to acknowledge this problem. I’d like to give you all some insight into the state of WOW Classic generally and into our realm (Heartseeker) specifically.

There is a Chinese/Russian gold farmer (Aoski) that has relentlessly farmed for months. He started off with just ore, but now he has evolved to being logged in 18 hours a day where he camps black lotus in Eastern Plaguelands and Burning Steppes. This character has at least 11 active accounts, 10 of which he uses to corpse camp the lotus at any given time. He used a warlock to summon numerous low level toons to each zone and then ran them to each of the spawn points. He has made an effort to conceal them in obscure places, as the pics below will show you. The pics will also show you him actively involved in the summoning process to prove that those characters are his.  In the few days it took for this reddit account to be approved, there is another NEW person doing this.There is now another separate level 60 rogue doing the same in Winterspring with a bunch of ghost accounts camping lotus spawn points. I question if these accounts are compromised or stolen.

Using this method allows him to keep track of the lotus constantly in each zone and also allows him to never miss a spawn. When he is online it is basically impossible for anyone else to get black lotus, unless of course you happen to get lucky and it spawns on top of you or as you run by. He uses his alt warlock to summon him instantly to either Burning Steppes or EPL so that he never misses a spawn. The SECOND the lotus spawns, he is on it. If you find it when he does, he will just vanish and put mobs on you.

We have tried to stop him by outcompeting him on lotus (making a raid full of herbalists) and also by having horde try to kill him. In the end, nothing works because he simply won’t stop. Also, the fact that he is a rogue makes him nearly impossible to intercept. This is where Blizzard needs to step in. 

I know someone will ask, “how do you know he is a Chinese farmer”. I’ve played wow for 10 years and I’ve spoken to numerous other people about him. Everyone is convinced. He has no guild, is non-verbal (only very poor English when necessary), and does nothing else other than farm and he usually logs in at odd hours. This is someone who is experienced and who is probably NOT just a one man act. He is much more advanced than the other Chinese farmers Heartseeker has running around. Additionally, the fact that he is logged in for upwards of 18 hours a day leads me to question if this is consistently the same person. 

It gets me angry someone like this has the audacity to do this and it gets me even angrier that Blizz won’t do anything about it. This character is stopping real players from being able to progress and farm. The last thing anyone wants to see when they log in after work is this player taking advantage. 

Generally, there are also many hunters logged in at night also aggressively gathering black lotus even when he is offline. It's virtually impossible for a normal player to get lotus at night anymore. 

PS: Sorry for the poor picture quality.

fd03hj,Guilty-Before-Trial,I will never again accuse someone of cheating in Blizzard games.,"We all know the meme. Guy whines on WoW forums about being banned but after some back and forth a Blue post comes up and tells how he was cheating and everyone makes fun of him. 

Well Blizzard doesn't allow that anymore. You get accused, your allowed one single reply for an appeal, and then an automated system says the same thing the first letter said and your account is closed with no recourse to get it back. Blizzard auto closes any future tickets and youre muted on the forums.

Now the real problem is that YOU CAN GET ADDITIONAL HELP but they entirely depends on you social media followers. There are multiple people that ONLY had their accounts restored due to their followers pestering Blizzard and then a REAL manual investigation takes place and miraculously they are found to have not cheated. MY follower count shouldn't be a measure of what level of support I get.

Well last week BOTH my accounts were closed for Bots and/or 3rd party programs. I was pissed. I'm not a F-ing cheater. Blizzard ignored me and I honestly thought that was the last time I would ever play a Blizzard game again.

Today I recieved this email

fcxzh1,BRlEN,Population degradation and merging of servers,"6 months or so into the game and I have done my fair share of MC's, Ony's, and now BWL. My guild at peak had 5 raid groups going with all clearing rag and 4 were on farm at the time of the release of BWL. However since around Christmas I have noticed a large amount of players taking breaks that lead into quitting or raid logging. My guild had to reorganize for BWL to be sure we could fill the raids we did have and even then we had people who signed up and a few weeks later disappear as well. I personally led a raid group at our peak we had to sit several people a few months ago, now with alts from other groups I can barely hit 30. 

After talking with several players who were nice enough to preemptively announce their departure of the game I think the burnout is real. Those who joined the game purely based on nostalgia have cleared MC more times in the first 2 phases than they ever did throughout vanilla. Onyxia is a joke. Now BWL has released but the requirement to farm potions and buffs beforehand combined with the slump in motivation has been too much for the average player. My server (netherwind) is one of the smaller servers and this has really hurt the raid population in every guild. I have talked with all of the guilds that were easily clearing MC are now struggling to clear BWL almost all purely based on attendance. My guild was lucky enough to be the largest and be able to fill 2 complete BWL raids that so far have cleared Nef each week and a 3rd that is half way through. Other guilds are not as lucky and are heavily recruiting to a server that has lost a significant part of its raiding community. And from what I have read here it is pretty common among most servers besides the high pop servers.

My question is whether blizzard  will merge servers and at what point? Based on trends most servers have lost 20-40% of their populations since release (https://ironforge.pro/servers/?filter=true&amp;server=us) and this was expected but the overall population of each server is skewed towards those whom have made several alts especially on the lower pop servers. I believe if blizzard merged the servers on the lower side together to create servers with similar populations to the large servers it would stem the tide of feeling of a ""dying server"". This feeling despite the smallest server being larger than a vanilla server is what kills in my opinion. You have the people that burn out that is inevitable but those around them see their friends leaving and have difficultly finding replacements are at a high likelihood of quitting too. I just hope the game i love to play can continue to thrive with the assistance of merging servers before it is too late and we left with 2-3 high pop servers and the rest ghost towns.

TL:DR
People are burning out and quitting, this causes small servers to have issues with raid population and creates a cycle of burn outs quitting and those who cannot find a consistent raid to also quit/transfer. Blizzard needs to merge small servers to break the cycle to retain players.",68,1583256359,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fcxzh1/population_degradation_and_merging_of_servers/,classicwow,1

The MT/gm/raid lead of my guild will not listen to me when it comes to vael strats. He is convinced we can just ""heal through"" BA on the tank and not do tank transitions. In trying to heal through BA  to keep him alive, we lose raid members to fire nova as the priests neglect their groups to keep him up as he frantically loses his shit on discord. How do I convince him that 1.) we do not have the DPS to kill Vael before a transition, so he needs to accept his death 2.) we need the DPS to realize that while vael is kind of a DPS race its more of a threat check than anything else, so stop going balls out and stay below the 2nd warrior 3.) you can't just ""heal through"" BA without losing half the raid to fire novas, and then you're just gonna fuckin wipe anyway. 

We aren't a hardcore guild, but I do like it in the guild and have made friends. I'd rather not leave, but I also don't want to spend the next two months wiping on vael due to stone stupidity and stubbornness on what is an easy fight mechanics wise.

fcvppm,JaggTank,A few anti-botting/leaching fixes,"Let me preface this by saying that I have little faith in Blizzard fixing this problem, however, I do think it's a problem that affects a large part of the playerbase. Anything from players being less able to farm in the open world, to players having to play obscene amounts of time in order to reach lower ranks in the honor system. 

So, with the first gang of botters about to hit R10 - R12 on various servers, I started to wonder how  Blizzard could effectively combat the scource of classic wow, which is widespread botting in the world and instances, combined with ruining the ranking system, primarily for casual players. 

The most hardcore honor grinders are already in stacked brackets and premades that can easily outearn a leach or a bot. This is how I know that no afk leacher or botter will be able to reach R13 and R14, because on a majority of servers, these brackets are very tightly controlled by players who can easily outearn the botters. 

The problem comes for players that used to be able to get into an AV premade that excluded leachers and bots, and thus earned a lot more honor per hour than the botters. This gave this type of players an opportunity to compete and ensured that botting and leaching would have limited viability for getting ranks. 

In the old days of AV botting/leaching the old plan was to stay in the cave or in the base in order to leach kills. 

However, with the change to diminishing return for honor kills, and players being more aggressive combatting bots,a few new metas have developed. First off the bots and leachers move to areas such as behind threes near contested points such as SH GY,  rogues and druids hide in field of strife in stealth, players hide in the horde base and at SP gy in order to avoid being detected and in order to be able to leach most of the kill honor. I've seen players following the zerg on mounts then riding away before they get killed, players hiding behind trees, in basements, under bridges, in places that require advanced wall-jumping and so on. 

At present, a typical honor gain rate in AV is 5k - 10k per hour, out of which about 40-50% are from bonus honor and 40 - 50% is from kills. Fixing the bonus honor appears to be an impossibility,  because it has to be zone wide in order to  create an incentive to defend, or how objectives rather than just running off to get the most kills or to the next objective. 

However, the kill honor is somewhat different. This is honor that could have a much shorter range (max spell cast range is 41 yards, to around 50 yards seems sensible), and in addition, could require a player contribution, meaning you can only get credit for a kill if you: 

A) Did damage to the player or a nearby member of the player's raid. 

B) Healed a player that did damage to the player or a member of the player's raid. 

C) Debuffed, buffed or crowd controlled the player or a member of the players raid. 

This requires that a player remain active and engaged with the enemy in order to get credit for that players death. No longer can someone hide on their mount under the SP bridge, or stealth around field of strife as they get credit for the work of other people, they would have to contribute now. 

Step 2 would be to implement a working reporting system, because the current one is clearly not working. The problem with the old system was that premades abused it to get rid of players under level 60, players with slow mounts or players that refused to follow the strategy laid out by the premade. As premades are now gone, it's time to bring the real report tool back. 

Does it have griefing potential? Yes, but having a reporting system that players see as pointless has griefing potential as well, in that players see no point in reporting the players who are griefing them by non-participation.

They use the ""Nostalrius AFK System"" which I named thusly b/c I first saw it practiced on said server.

They would stay mounted a few meters behind the melee line, never participating or helping their team. If attacked they would run away only to resume afk leeching.

These are almost always Rank 8+ players.

I have to stop playing, click on them and select REPORT FOR CHEATING and then type AV AFK BOT or smt. Now imagine having to go round and report 6 or 7 of these Ranker leechers. My toon isn't contributing either while I take the time to go dig up the leecher rats (some of them go hide in out-of-the-way-places) and then spend time to right click and write the report.

I used to report them as ""AV AFK BOT"" but it seems that Blizzard want to report them as **""PvP Non-Participation/Exploitation""** which I am going to do starting today.

Thirdly, stop doing dodgy shit. 99.9% of people just regularly play and dont get banned, if you are complaining that casting your game to your cars display so you can control it while you are driving to work got you banned, maybe reflect on the ridiculousness of what you are doing to play the game...",0,1583224300,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fcrorq/getting_unbanned_on_your_11th_appeal_doesnt_make/,classicwow,1

fcrkmv,sandro992,Mage Stat Priority - Hit % Question,"Ok so I’ve read about stat priority for mages and it clearly says hit % should be on the first place.

If I’m right so far you can get:
- Banthok Sash 1%
- Star of Mysteria 1%
- Arcanist head 1%
- Pvp blue boots 1%
- Band of forced concentration 1%
- Ringos blizzard boots 1%
- Bracers of arcane accuracy 1%
- Neltharions tear 2%

And in P4 you get +5% hit from bloodvine(although pvp blues will have to be removed) set + zg head enchant

That means beside ZG stuff you need +5% hit to get to the cap.

My question here is how important is how important is hit in comparison to spell power?

Are stuff like orb of the darkmoon and mana igniting cord worth the gold/dkp to get them, or should I keep banthok sash and star of mysteria to get the hit cap ASAP. I would feel dumb to spend 200-250g on a necklace which i would change at some point for a blue necklace, same goes for mana igniting cord which is in such a high demand and goes off for a lot dkp.",22,1583223490,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fcrkmv/mage_stat_priority_hit_question/,classicwow,1

This is mi first time playing WoW and decided to go classic, as leveling and living adventure is what I enjoyed the most while I used to play Lineage II. I want to enjoy the game, I don't care about farming late equipment or pvping.

I read that for a ""full experience"" some people recommend playing in a PvP server, as getting attacked by other players is also part of the game and a kind of social interaction. This is why I started in a pvp server.

In the other hand I wonder if in a PvE or RP server people will be more similar to my view of the game, and I could find more people exploring and questing around the map, and not just packed at ogrimmar.

What do you think? I'm lvl 10 so I can change without losing too much.

fco6ob,dogmeat92163,What to do when your main tank is not good at this game?,"Here’re some of the errors he’s made:

1. During Nef fight, rogues were called, and instead of turning the head some 45 degrees to the side, so that the rogues won’t get torched, he turned it 90 degrees away from the entire raid. By doing so he ran out of healing range  , and let all melee and casters get hit with Nef’s tail swipe.

2. During [Razorgore](https://www.google.com/search?q=Razorgore&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjT_8Dlnf3nAhWOe30KHVtoA48QBSgAegQICxAq) or the three Drake fights, he would taunt the boss while standing near the melee classes, letting the melee classes get hit by cleave or flame breath. 

3. During Vael fight, he was off-tanking, and he would stand too close to the head and die to flame breath damage. We wiped two times because he died prematurely, and we noticed the issue only when we checked the logs.

4. During Baron Geddon fight, he would stand in the fire nova taking all the damage.

5. Yesterday he pulled Garr while trying to pull a lava hound, causing the raid to wipe.

6. He used to wear the entire T1 set plus damage mitigation gear to tank without getting enough hit, so his threat production was horrendous.

We noticed there were many issues with him, so for BWL, another off-tank has basically replaced him as the main tank, but yesterday the first binding after months of clearing MC finally dropped, and he got it. As a fury warrior I should be glad that we are closer to getting TF which means more threat output by the tank, but with his bad skill, I wish someone else would have gotten the binding. To be fair, he has perfect attendance since the first day we started raiding MC and ONY back in November. He doesn't argue about loot, and he can take criticism. He helps out clan members when he can, and I think he's generally a nice dude, but I wish he was a better player.",95,1583204854,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fco6ob/what_to_do_when_your_main_tank_is_not_good_at/,classicwow,1

Flame buffet seems to stack quickly...is there no timer between each buffet?  Even with 180FR i was getting 5 stacks in less than 10 seconds quite often.   This was also causing a huge amount of casting pushback...is the pushback only when you take a stack or each time firemaw  casts flame buffet ?

Fire resistance seems to only help resist stacks for flame buffet, but does nothing to reduce the  damage from the stacks you do take.  Is that correct?  It's just +150 each stack. 

* When stack 1 hits you it’s 150 damage
* When stack 2 hits you it’s 300 damage
* When stack 3 hits you it’s 450 damage
* When stack 4 hits you it’s 600 damage
* When stack 5 hits you it’s 750 damage

i also didn't see anything in my logs indicating I resisted any flame buffets.  I just assumed it was happening due to the inconsistency with the stack timing.    


Out biggest issue seems to be healing..maybe healers not realizing the pushback, I know my cast bar wasn't showing anything, just  a huge delay before it even showed my casts starting on that fight.   A Shadow Flame and Thresh pretty much spelled death for the tanks...I'm also seeing some sources indicating Thresh is 2 quick hits, others that indicate it's 3...ie 2 additional attacks.

fckmbm,classicwowlive,ClassicWoW.live Hardcore Community Cup - 2/29 Standings,"Over the weekend hundreds of players gathered together to participate in ClassicWoW.live’s Hardcore Community Cup. The event highlighted Classic WoW’s leveling experience with one key caveat: death = delete. Whoever had reached the highest level after 10 hours--without dying--would be declared the winner. The full list of rules is available on the ClassicWoW.live Hardcore page.

The event kicked off at 9am EST Saturday morning on the US-RP server Bloodsail Buccaneers. Scores of competitors could be seen gathering in each starting zone during the minutes leading up to the countdown. Kargoz, in attendance with other names such as Docken, Voivid and Nohitjerome, whose seat was later filled by Defcamp, were to cast the event in real time monitoring the streams and progress of the event’s contestants. Staples in the leveling scene such as Ahmpy, Tacticslol, Alenya and Navak were presents with scores of other serious competitors and a multitude of leveling hobbyists. Once all was in place, the contestants and casters were situated, it was time to begin.

At 9am EST on the dot the race began. Resembling the conditions of a fresh server launch, every player began their journey at the same place. The Hardcore leveling pack blazed through the starting zones with thousands watching on Twitch and YouTube. 

Strategies on how much water and food to carry, weapon progression, skill training and quest routes began to separate the competition transitioning from the starting areas to the secondary zones. Tricks were tried, shots were shot and mistakes were made as more competitors dropped out of the race due to overzealous pulls, unfortunately timed abilities or just plain bad luck. During the 14 to 19 stretch viewers watched in surprise as the Druid leader, Tarohc(14), the Mage leader, Frostlive(18), and the Rogue leader, Teriko(19), all died leaving new players to take their place.
 
The leveling race ended with Hunters on top and a smattering of the other classes within the top 10. View the full leaderboard here: https://classicwow.live/hardcore. Join us for the next Hardcore leveling event in April. Date and information to follow under the Sign Up section.

fcihyl,Elidian,54 and finally considering farming for my mount,"Hello - 

I just hit 54 yesterday on my NE dr00d and while I've previously had no real need to get mine due to Travel Form, I'm starting to really feel the inefficiency of not having a mount when I'm traveling long distances trying to tie up some loose ends, like going back to Desolace to solo the khans in Maraudon for my Mark of the Chosen trinket. Zones like that are an absolute nightmare to cross when I'm not grinding out mobs for XP along the way. I can't imagine how it would be for someone without some form of movement speed increase.

Instead of buying my mount, I instead opted to use whatever I skinned, along with practically all the gold I earned from quest rewards and vendoring stuff, to raise my Tribal Leatherworking to 300 as a personal goal, which I just hit this morning. I am fully aware that Leatherworking is no longer much of a money-maker, if at all, now that Phase 1 blew by quickly and everyone's already got their Devilsaur pieces and have likely moved on to whatever upgrades there might be.

The eventual plan is to drop either Skinning or LW in order to pick up Enchanting for Smoking Heart of the Mountain, but I have a few things on my mind about what to do for now, all things considered, and was hoping to get some input/suggestions.

Should I:
-Just worry about leveling and gearing and not worry about the mount at the moment
-Drop Leatherworking to pick up Enchanting and just skin a ton of leather and sell on the AH? The goal for LW was to gear myself as much as I could, which I did very well throughout the leveling process, along with being able to gear out whatever Rogue, Warrior, and Hunter alts I might roll in the future, so I'd ideally like to keep LW unless it's just a huge time/money sink and the money spent on crafting gear for alts would be better spent on mount/enchanting/etc and just buying gear off the AH.
-Keep LW, drop Skinning, and pick up Enchanting and just do non-gathering forms of gold-making, such as killing bosses for loot and selling on AH/vendoring, BRD coffer runs at some point, etc?

Any help/advice will be greatly appreciated. I apologize in advance for the block text, as I forget how to separate paragraphs.

fciaga,ApolloMk2,Where to quest at lvl33 when you're seemingly out of zones?,"Hey Guys, Recently picked up Classic WoW and convinced my wife to start playing. Because we've duo'd everything, but rarely have time for dungeons.. I feel like we've cleared out all the quests within our levels that are reasonable. Whats left is mostly quests that are marked 6-8 levels higher than us, which makes it really hard to hit crap. So maybe you can give me some guidance on what our next step should be. Here's what we've cleared out so far...

Finished all quests in Redridge, Wetlands, and Duskwood.

Done all quests within 5 levels in STV, Alterac, Arathi, and Hillsbrad.

I feel like I've been wasting a lot of time running around between all these areas to do the few quests within our level. Is there somewhere I'm forgetting? Or should I just grind out a couple missing levels on trash? I've been trying to keep it a little more interesting than that since I'm trying to keep the wife interested (ya know, trying to make that dream a reality..), but I can do that on my own if needed.

Everything is going amazing. While the player retention for a guild like this is going as expected, we still stay between 45-60 members as we level.

Our members range in levels from 10-56, with the core being roughly in their late 20s through mid 30s. We have dungeon groups going consistently within different level brackets building a solid community in and out of game.

Perhaps your friends quit on you after launch, maybe your server got destroyed by server transfers, or just maybe the guild or character wasn’t what you imagined it was going to be. Regardless of the reason you are looking for a fresh start we would LOVE to have you join us!

fcherh,Jasquirtin,Feelings on Classic so far,"Hello classic community! I just wanted to post my thoughts on how classic has been so far and hear how your journey through Azeroth has been!

I played WoW back in its original release and since quitting during WoTLK I had always wanted to see another game of its stature or it to come back. You can imagine all of our excitement when it was announced. As is 12 year old kid I did not raid and only had 1 60 ( I was an altaholic).  My goals for classic was to relive the glory days but also to accomplish things I did not and that was raiding and getting a 2nd 60. 

Since classic launch I have a 60 priest and warlock and working on twinking a 29 hunter for AB. I have most T1 from MC and soon will get into BWL once graduate school dies down for me. I’ve had tons of fun! How about you guys!?

My only wish was that the content release schedule would slow down a little. I have accomplished what I think is a good amount as some people say they still aren’t 60. I’ve raided MC a lot and will do BWL soon. I don’t feel like I need phase 4 anytime soon yet here we are staring it in the face with AB and ZG announced. Classic life span was over 2 years before TBC and I can’t help but feel if TBC is announced, it will be launched before classic is 2 years old.

fcfxke,RAEastwood,“How’s Roguing?”,"I have an undergrad paper due tonight, so naturally I spent the morning playing classic. A friend of mine suspected as much, and texted to ask “How’s roguing?”

In response, I might have just  maxed my procrastination skill:

(*)If by roguing, you mean home working, then marginally. I did however travel to the continent of Kalimdor and cleanse the Un’goro Crater of Horde filth for at least an hour.  

There was a humid mist in the air of the Un’goro jungle. The lush green blades of tropical succulents seemed to cast an emerald hue upon the haze. 

Upon my steed I galloped between hulking tree roots, bounded between tar pits, and waded through marshy pools of turquoise spring water - a natural fertilizer flowing down from the mountainous ridges of Feralas. 

At first my interests were purely horticultural, for I sought alchemical ingredients to produce Elixirs of Mana, derived from the Dreamfoil flower native to this region.  

Though a rustling in the nearby foliage informed me I was not alone. Spurred forward by an immediate rush of adrenaline, with the agility afforded only to members of my class, I tore across the lowlands and dove into the foliage for cover.  

Aided with a sprinkle of the dust of disappearance, I vanished from sight, and waited.... 

All was then quiet, save for the exotic chirps and trills of the various avian species for which Un’goro was home.   

But then, in a nearby clearing, I saw him.  

A spry yellow lion proudly emerged from its jungle cover, sniffing the air, strong and stalwart.  

Confident that he was alone, the beast transformed before my very eyes into a massive bovine creature, one of the plainstriders, a Tauren. His name was Menopaws. 

So I killed the bitch. (*)

Actually though, I’m going to write my paper now. Pce.",3,1583171660,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/fcfxke/hows_roguing/,classicwow,1
