fs7jt2,tanaus,What Motivated Me To Exercise Regularly," 

I firmly believe that you must always be consistent with what you are doing and find the joy in it. Be proud of yourself and your work. Through determination, setting goals and personal faith you can fulfill your dreams and become the best you can be.

While life happened, I had difficulty staying healthy and struggled with the overall factor in quality of my life. Inspired to make a change, I decided to join a gym and to implement a regular weight, strength training routines that target specific muscle groups, and this was exactly what I needed.

**The story behind my motivation to exercise regularly.** Many people today are continually looking for a magical quick-fix to weight loss, maintenance of health, youthful appearance, and vitality. The truth is‚Ä¶There is no quick fix! Instead, you should challenge yourself to push forward and never stop trying to find ways to do things better, regardless of your setbacks, defeats, failures, losses, pains and fears. Commit to consistent actions to get in and stay in shape or to achieve the results you desire. As you shift towards this new attitude it will help you stay motivated and focused on your development and improvement.

*‚ÄúSet realistic goals that include clear milestones, and as you progress toward your goal, you‚Äôll find a ripple effect occurs and things fall into place in your work, home life, and health.‚Äù*

For me it wasn‚Äôt about superficial pleasures such as weight loss, looking good, and acceptance by others. These rewards are more concrete and often short-lived. Whatever your goal is, keep it realistic and you can actually adapt your life around meeting those goals; just make sure you write it down and revisit it daily.

Ever noticed how your body feels when you‚Äôre under stress? My muscles get tense, especially in my neck and shoulders, leaving me with back or neck pain, and painful headaches. The worry and discomfort of all these physical symptoms can in turn lead to even more stress, creating a vicious cycle between my mind and body. As a result of all these changes, I lost my sense of self ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt remember who I was or what I liked to do.

Physical exercising is an effective way for me to break this cycle, helping me relax the muscles and relieve the tension in my body. Exercise also promotes a better sleep habit that is thought to reduce stress. Exercising regularly can improve your mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. Since the body and mind are so closely linked, when your body feels better so, too, will your mind.

The bottom line is; physical exercise offered me incredible benefits that improved nearly every aspect of my health from the inside out. Through the experiences in my life, and an extremely supportive community, I curated my own lifestyle, designed and motivated by my sense of meaning and purpose, which contributes to my overall well-being.

frli31,ZadarskiDrake,[Discussion] Ever since i started going with my mom to her orthopedic surgeons follow up appointments i got fairly motivated to try hard to achieve what i want in life,"Ive been to about 4 appointments so far so ive gotten to know him pretty well. He is 37 years old and he is a top tier orthopeic/nerve surgeon.. he makes over $800,000 per year and has 4 stunning cars. He has a 2017 R8, a new lamborghini SVJ. a porsche gt2rs (2019) and a ferrari 488 pista. He is by far the smartest person i have ever talked to in my life. He went to a top 5 medical school and finished top of his class with the best scores. He is probably 6‚Äô5‚Äù minimum and a very good looking guy. When i saw him speak to other employees in the hospital i noticed the respect they showed him and he is simply a genius with what he does in surgery. I know i wont get to his level but he motivated me to try hard in life. I always look forward to talking to him even if it is for just 5-10 minutes. He is always down to talk to me a little bit about cars and what im up to. Hes also one of the only people ive ever met who seems to enjoy their job and is proud of his work. imo he deserves a pay raise for being a hero",1,1585548754,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/frli31/discussion_ever_since_i_started_going_with_my_mom/,GetMotivated,1

fr5i9b,Lazu5ena,"[TEXT] Quote by Beppo Roadsweeper from Michael Ende‚Äòs ‚ÄûMomo‚Äú - You must never think of the whole street at once, understand?","‚Äû...it's like this. Sometimes, when you've a very long street ahead of you, you think how terribly long it is and feel sure you'll never get it swept. And then you start to hurry. You work faster and faster and every time you look up there seems to be just as much left to sweep as before, and you try even harder, and you panic, and in the end you're out of breath and have to stop--and still the street stretches away in front of you. That's not the way to do it.

You must never think of the whole street at once, understand? You must only concentrate on the next step, the next breath, the next stroke of the broom, and the next, and the next. Nothing else.

That way you enjoy your work, which is important, because then you make a good job of it. And that's how it ought to be.

And all at once, before you know it, you find you've swept the whole street clean, bit by bit. what's more, you aren't out of breath. That's important, too...‚Äú

fr546q,ambarnarwal,Is motivation enough to form a habit of meditation?,"Forming a habit of meditation is something which I have personally struggled with. As someone who had meditated enough to realize its value, I was unhappy that I couldn't a form of a habit of meditating consistently. One of the reasons for that had been that my approach towards change didn't match with the science of forming habits.  


We are always obsessed with motivation to help us stick to a behaviour, whereas habit building science tells us that it requires more than just motivation. Ease of performing the habit and routine based reminders also matter equally. Science tells us that motivation is the most unreliable factor in habit formation.  


In order to solve for this, after having spent months on research around habit building \[ Tiny Habits, Atomic Habits , The power of habit etc\], I have finally built a beta version of an app which aims to form a life-long habit of meditation for its users. It incorporates all the three factors responsible for habit formation.  


I believe it would be a great help for people who want to stay motivated for meditation without relying just on motivation.  


We are building an accountability buddy and group challenges feature in it too!!  


I would love to invite this community to be an early user for my app! I would want the app to be shaped by the insights given by this community",0,1585484659,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fr546q/is_motivation_enough_to_form_a_habit_of_meditation/,GetMotivated,1

fr3z11,lordsumpen,[TEXT] It's never too late to start on your health and fitness journey. With so many benefits it can be a whole new world.,"Growing up, I was raised with bad health, fitness, and eating habits. When I graduated high school I weighed 340 lb at 6' 2.  I used to be a heavy drinker and smoker on top of that. I knew I needed to make a change and I started working out. As time went on I learned better and better habits. In my late teens and early twenties I looked older, which I thought was great at the time (especially because I could buy booze without getting carded at times lol), But as time goes on, we all want to look our best.
  Today I do almost daily cardio and stretching and lift weights. During this pandemic, do body weight exercises. YouTube is an amazing source for routines. 
 I was going through pictures with a friend yesterday reflecting on some of my progress through life and they told me it was like I'm aging backwards. That made me feel great and is an additional motivating factor now. It's never too late to start, it's never too late to be the best you.",4,1585478307,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fr3z11/text_its_never_too_late_to_start_on_your_health/,GetMotivated,1

Everything will go away and everything will pass,
All worries and panic will go away,
Again the roads will become flat
And the gardens will be full of flowers again.

Let's call for help reason,
Let's beat the disease by force of knowledge,
And the days of the hard exam
We survive as one family!

We will become cleaner and wiser
They did not succumb to the dark and fear.
Let us rise in spirit and become
closer and better to each other!

And let's have a festive chair
We are all looking forward to Life again,
And let the Highest on this day
send a piece of happiness to every home!

fqpiti,Chellz93,"[Article] I LOST MY JOB last week because of COVID-19. For anyone else who has lost their job in the last few weeks, the Change Curve has shown me how to pick myself back up again","Job loss can be an extremely difficult change to go through. With the recent rise in unemployment, there are so many people who already have or are worried about losing their job. Since I recently lost mine due to the pandemic, I realized that it is very easy to get down on yourself during this time.

I found the Kubler-Ross Change Curve which has shown me the stages that one generally goes through before they can pick themselves back up again. Over the course of this curve, productivity can sharply drop, but it will eventually pick back up again and go to a new high.

The Change Curve can help one with dealing with the change that job loss and layoffs can bring. There are 3 stages that I have listed:

1. Shock &amp; Denial
2. Frustration &amp; Depression
3. Experimentation, Decision &amp; Integration

During this time be sure to keep relying on your Rational brain and not let your Limbic/Feeling side control you. This tends to happen far too often.

Keep your head up. Your time will come.

fql8te,_doiwannaknow_,Writing this after seven years of soul searching!,"Currently I am 25 years old. When I was 22 I had a strong feeling of becoming an actor. When I was 16 I use to imagine myself playing cricket for my country. Sometimes after watching Eric Clapton, I dream about playing guitar in front of thousands. I also want to earn money, not greedy but if tomorrow I want to buy a good camera let's say, I should have the money to get it. The thing about staying motivated is that you should know what you want from life. I don't hit the gym for those six pack abs because I know I am never going to be an actor, then why invest so much in it ? I also don't like studying, but I have to do it because I need to earn from somewhere. The only thing I know is I would like to get famous and receive respect from people. I have always wanted not be an average man. But now I am sort of tired of finding what would make me great. How to keep myself motivated in such situations ?

fq4q2p,aristhought,[Text] You don‚Äôt need to hate yourself for not being the most productive during a literal global pandemic.,"You‚Äôll lose all motivation in an instant if you put too much pressure on yourself in such a chaotic time.

It‚Äôs good to plan out things to do. To have routine and to do lists and start projects. But productivity is worthless if it‚Äôs simply punishment on your mind which is absolutely still reeling on adjusting to the world changing in the course of a few weeks. 

Having trouble being fully productive? Don‚Äôt hate yourself for it. Do little things that make you feel better. Gradually build up a structure. Cry or complain if you need to.

fpu6t7,FortuneFated,"[Text] ""And the people stayed home."" - Time to work on yourself and rebuild one day at a time; The sun will rise again and this too shall pass.","**‚ÄúAnd the people stayed home.‚Äù**

I recently discovered this amazing poem by Kitty O'Meara that has powerful implications during this global pandemic:

*‚ÄúAnd the people stayed home. And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently.*

*And the people healed. And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, mindless, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal.*

*And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed.‚Äù*

\-- Kitty O'Meara  


Staying home is critical to slow the spread of this exceptionally contagious virus but keeping healthy at home presents challenges. With a positive perspective, we have the opportunity to make the most of our time at home to self-reflect and adopt good habits that we all want to possess but never have the time for. The world has already changed vastly because of this situation but it isn't all doom and gloom; This is the time to build stronger foundations at home to prepare for the new opportunities in the future. 

*""Write, that‚Äôs what you do. So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. I‚Äôll keep writing,"" O'Meara says. ""We have gifts. It‚Äôs a good reminder that whatever your gift is, and however small it is, keep using it. This is a really good time for that.""*

The pandemic has illuminated many urgent issues while allowing the actions of real leaders to stand out in contrast to the huge incompetency of others (I‚Äôm not pointing fingers; they know what they that did). Let‚Äôs assess how well our governments respond during this time and perhaps even consider how delicate our financial systems are in the first place and how quickly bailouts are required just to keep the ship from sinking. Bailing can provide extra time in the short-term, but it seems more important to pay attention to all the holes and start fixing them. 

The time is now to work towards improving our systems so they can be more accountable and transparent. Our society urgently needs some restructuring so that our tax money actually goes where intended, and businesses stop exploiting resources and our planet for the sake of profit. The world is complicated and change isn't easy, but that doesn't mean it's not worth doing. No more business as usual, no more 'The rich get richer, and the poor stay poor'. The voice of many can overpower the few; Let's begin with more honest dialogue about the state of the world and discard political alignment. We may think that people are different because we have agreed-upon imaginary lines that separate us, but that ignores the bigger picture that we are all humans and we only have one planet (For now, Elon's working on it). Let's step up and insist on integrity in all our institutions to collectively shift our current trajectory toward a better tomorrow and a future we are proud to transfer to the next generations. 

Struggle during this extraordinary time is inevitable and we can't change the reality of this situation but each of us has the ability to choose how we respond to it. Start at home and make it the best environment you can. Embrace this time to work towards the best version of yourself, and once this has all passed and we can appreciate the simple things like hugs and handshakes again, then we collectively get back to the drawing board and decide what a prosperous nation looks like. History is written every day and we have the power to live out the stories that will be told; Ensure your voice is heard and your actions align with your intentions.

fpq29f,sydneyd22,Don‚Äôt sit down and scroll on your phone after working out [Story],"You told yourself one hour of walking.

‚ÄúAs soon as that digital clock hits 1:00:00, I‚Äôm outta here‚Äù.

You began making bargains with yourself:

‚ÄúIf I hit 2.00 miles before I make it an hour, I‚Äôll get off and I‚Äôll probably have burned the same amount of calories‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. That‚Äôs cheating‚Äù.

You stick to your guns.

You hit 2.00 miles and toss around the thought of stopping right now.

Did you make it to an hour? No, but you still went pretty far. I mean, two miles is a lot.

Just stop now. It‚Äôs fine.

Still unsure, you keep walking.

You‚Äôve reached 51 minutes as Joe Rogan and Duncan Trussell talk about mind-bending things that you can barely pay attention to.

You check the timer every minute.

Now every 30 seconds.

Now every 10 seconds.

At this point you‚Äôre 4 minutes away from your goal. An hour now feels tangible and you keep going.

Before you know it, you see it:

‚Äú1:00‚Äù the treadmill reads in digital numbers.

Satisfied and at peace, you slow down the treadmill and get off.

You just did an hour of walking and didn‚Äôt give up. Maybe it was just the caffeine, but does it matter?

From here you make a healthy dinner of Great Northern beans and a banana while your mom eats a taco pizza.

The thought of biting into a greasy piece of pizza makes your skin crawl.

You finish your meal and place your bowl into the sink.

Debating if you should wash everything in the sink or not, you do it anyway.

You see your mom‚Äôs greasy pizza pan.

‚ÄúShould I- no, she can do it. Not my responsibility‚Äù.

Then it occurs to you.

‚ÄúMomentum‚Äù, you think.

‚ÄúI need to keep this momentum going...‚Äù

You wash the pan, at first, half-hearted, then think of that word again:

‚ÄúMomentum‚Äù.

You scrub the pan so well, that it looks better than it did before.

Wondering what you can do next to keep this momentum going, you grab your phone and write this.

To remind you of Newton‚Äôs famous law:

An object in motion stays in motion.

Do the little things that take extra work that you usually give up on.

You determine where it ends. When the productivity stops, but don‚Äôt let it be now.

Not with all these endorphins from that workout you just crushed. Keep it going. Get stuff done.

TL;DR: I completed a worked out and continued doing things rather than sitting down.",9,1585280789,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fpq29f/dont_sit_down_and_scroll_on_your_phone_after/,GetMotivated,1

PZ-01 ""I think it would be cool to have a picture thread once a week where people can show something they have accomplished by TAKING ACTION. It not only is a    testament of fulfilling a task, but a picture is a concrete materialization of said endeavor. I feel like doing something and having a picture to look at later at night gives me a reminder that I did good and I can go to sleep proud.""

Examples: Messy room before/after.  A page of hand written study notes.   A ticked off to-do list.   A picture of a readout from an exercise machine.  A hand written plan for the week.  A picture from the top of a hill you have climbed.  A picture of an email with happy client feedback.   A graph of the number of miles you have walked in the past year.

foz5ri,FollicularManslaught,[Story] I wrote a thing but i know not what to do with it.," Love is not a game, it is not a short lived concept, it is not picked up  and dropped, it is not controlled by whim,by fate, by circumstance, or  by inspiration. Love exists because i say it does. Love exists, because  it is a concept I adhere to, I uphold, I embody. Love is forged, shaped,  remade, remolded, built up, and allowed to fade. Love exists because I  allow it. I  allow it to flow through me. I allow it to give hope to  others. I allow it to take up residence in my heart when it can find no  other place to weather. Love exists because I choose it to. I choose  love because I find it to be a necessity for life to bloom in the manner  I see fit. Love has no inherit form, no shape to call its own. It does  not need it. Love only needs to exist, the shape it takes is relevant  only in the moments it exists after it will recede into the hearts that  allow it to blossom and spread. Waiting to take form as needed, never  remaining hidden for longer than necessary. True enough love exists  outside of me to some degree in most hearts or souls. It existed long  before me, and far beyond me. It will continue to exists without me, but  I choose to harbor it as long as i draw breath. I choose to believe in  it. I choose to see the child in everyone. The two year old so new to  the world that merely taking the steps I take for granted are enough to  cause joy. I choose to love people like a proud father see's their only  child catch a ball for the first time. Like when a new friend is made in  either a teddy bear or a school mate. I choose to love even when all i  can do is watch as the first break up consumes their soul. When the  first friend betrays, when the first knee is bloodied, when the first  pet dies. We all remember well our first losses. When there was no  consolation. All the hugs and kisses, and kind wishes, could not so much  as lift our gaze from the floor. I choose to love from a distance. I  know I can not take a way pain, or doubt, fear, or regret. I know that  the only way forward is to let those that struggle, continue to do so,  because it is in struggle that we garner strength. It is through  perseverance that we learn to love, not only our selves, but the  struggle its self. I know the only way through is to make peace with  ourselves. The only way through is to feel our doubt, our shame, our  suffering. If what you want is love, you have to make it for yourself.  You must not give up. You must  not hate the struggle. You must learn to  choose love, for yourself. You must choose to love others, not on a  whim, not through the short sights of epiphany, not through pity, not  through hate, not for notoriety, not for reward. You must love because  that is what you choose. You must love because you know there is no  other choice. You must love because without you or me holding on even in  desperation, it will fade, and with it so will we.",0,1585173500,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/foz5ri/story_i_wrote_a_thing_but_i_know_not_what_to_do/,GetMotivated,1
foylr4,dontwasteink,[Discussion] Sometimes it's not about will power.,"So I was feeling lethargic, didn't feel like doing anything for a couple of days, then I went back to my old glasses and my energy levels returned to normal.

What I'm trying to say is, will-power and forming habits are important, but not the only things that affect your motivation.

You should also work towards trying to be more comfortable and energized, because trying power through the lack of those isn't sustainable when you're trying to reach any goal.

Mental could be seeing a therapist, or cutting toxic people out of your life, doing meditation.

Physical could be getting the right glasses, fixing your sleep apnea, exercise and diet, working on fixing that back or tooth ache that constantly bugs you.",0,1585171576,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/foylr4/discussion_sometimes_its_not_about_will_power/,GetMotivated,1

And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently.  
And the people healed. And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, mindless, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal.  
And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed - Kitty O'Meara

The world has turned into fear and doom pretty quickly.

I just want to point out that most governments are doing measures that go in the right direction and with social distancing you can stay almost 100% safe.

Also the death rate in germany shows that its basically under cfr 1% IF health care is working good and is not overloaded

So lets all hope by staying socially distanced numbers will drop further. We will survive next waves too.

Life is good, spread positivity and keep motivated!

fo25g2,elizabethany6,‚Äúwhatever‚Äù can change to ‚Äúamazing‚Äù fast.,"‚ÄúLife is particularly frustrating in that it can go from amazing to terrible very quickly. Clearly! We‚Äôre seeing that right now.  


BUT at the same time, my life experience has taught me that in the same way that things can go from good to bad fast,¬†

life can also go from ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù to ‚Äúamazing‚Äù even faster.  


There‚Äôs no denying that what‚Äôs happening right now is a ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù moment.  


Whatever is happening is happening. Our lives have become ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù - seemingly put on hold. Our social lives, careers, bank accounts and gyms are all on hold.

Because of that, it also seems that a lot of the things that typically make us happy and fulfilled are also on hold - friends, going on dates, hitting the town, just being free and independent.  


So, right now it‚Äôs kinda just ‚Äúwhatever.‚Äù  


I can‚Äôt deny that. It‚Äôs whatever.  


But ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù can change to ‚Äúamazing‚Äù fast.  


My life has proven this. I have gone through times of just bleh and then BOOM out of nowhere, amazing things just happened.  


It‚Äôs the memory of that very fact that keeps my head up during this time.  


It‚Äôs the acknowledgment that life can go from ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù to amazing fast that makes me smile right now.  


Life happens fast and I‚Äôd rather keep my smile intact knowing that ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù can change to ‚Äúamazing‚Äù at any moment.  


There‚Äôs no denying this! Life has taught me this in undeniable ways.¬†  


You can go from feeling lost and unmotivated‚Ä¶ to one day finding something that lights your soul on fire and completely changes the course of your life.

That is how life works. You can go from 0 to 100 real quick.  
Right now, admittedly we went from 100 to 0. And that sucks, not gonna lie.  


But I keep my head up because I know how fast it can reverse. I know how fast life can go from ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù to ‚Äúamazing.‚Äù  


I‚Äôm not going to panic. I‚Äôm not going to be miserable and ¬†not going to lose hope.  
I know that things can go from ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù to amazing FAST.  


That drives me. It gives me hope. It reminds me that the sun comes out after it rains and then it‚Äôs sunny for a long time and I‚Äôm having the most fulfilling, best time of my life.‚Äù¬†

fo11fr,Vaidehi211,Aloof Abode // Uncover yourself,"

It‚Äôs a frightening time. We‚Äôre in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, with cities and even entire countries shutting down. Some of us are in areas that have already been affected by **coronavirus**. Others are bracing for what may come. And all of us are watching the headlines and wondering, ‚ÄúWhat is going to happen next?‚Äù 

Orders by Government to stay aloof and to practice social distancing are to be strictly followed. Why not utilize this time to take a closer look within us and embrace ourselves with self-love? The world is facing a major crisis and we as humans are the victims. Going outside is not allowed but no one has stopped you from going inside, right? Everyone is practicing personal hygiene, but is it inclusive of **mental hygiene**? 

Stay away from media if you have started feeling overwhelmed. Instead, **introspect** within and help yourselves grow and evolve into the strongest person possible. **Rewind your life** into the age when you were a child. Remember the love you got from the surroundings and the love you manifested to outside. Analyse your upbringing and take a look into any blockages you may feel through the process. Clear those , feel uplifted, rearrange the linear mindsets and get ready for the future. 

Here's a small video to instill the fact that '**We are strong and can fight anything worse that may come' and the fact that 'this is a precious life and to be continued**'‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®

fnvm0q,morecoffeethanhuman,[Text] Motivation won't work unless you do.,"Motivation is awesome, but you can't rely on it. Because there's going to be a time when *nothing* can motivate you. When you scour post after post looking for *something* that will spark that tiny bit of motivation that you think you **need** but you can't find it. 

What's next? Are you just gonna *give up* now that you didn't find an external motivator??? Because surely if you give up that easily*,* you didn't really want what you're trying to achieve that badly in the first place. Goals take work. **Hard. Fucking. Work.** There's no way around the work. 

So many people don't find the motivation they're searching for so they don't take action and their goals never get reached. So many people *do* find the motivation but then *fail to take action* and their goals never get reached. Fuck, so many people read posts in this subreddit and then go on to *whine* in the comments about how whatever was posted didn't motivate them. Do you really want to be motivated or are you just looking for a fucking **EXCUSE** not to do the work??? 

You gotta get really honest with yourself and decide if you *really* want to achieve the goals you've set. *Then* you gotta decide if you're willing to do the work. If you're not, throw away the goals and make new ones. If you are, **TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY**. Do one little thing that would get you closer to reaching that goal. If you need to make a list of how to do it first, make that list. Make that plan. Then **TAKE ACTION**.

Then continue taking action, whether you're motivated or not. Because that's the only way you're going to accomplish anything.",0,1585010530,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fnvm0q/text_motivation_wont_work_unless_you_do/,GetMotivated,1

fnpynb,Who_Ho_Oh,[Discussion] What habits have you picked up while adjusting to life during a pandemic?,"Like many others, I‚Äôm stuck in my house for a much larger percentage of my day than usual - only going outside for picking up groceries, takeout (support your local restaurants and service staff!!!) or for a walk around the neighborhood. 

Recently, I‚Äôve noticed some less-than-desirable habits creeping into my daily life (sleeping in, procrastination, etc.) which were never really issues before. 

I‚Äôve read that forming a new habit takes anywhere from 21 days (apparently debunked a few years ago), to the new accepted average of 66, all the way to 254 days! Regardless, now seems like an excellent time to develop positive, lifelong habits!!! 

I could use some motivation. And I think others could, as well.

What are some new habits that you have picked up as a result of adjusting to the preventative measures for COVID-19? 

(P.s. Some little green guy told me that ‚Äúthe greatest teacher, failure is.‚Äù I think that identifying bad habits early on is the best way to eliminate them and develop good habits - so I‚Äôll accept new bad habit submissions, as well!

fngnq5,ykaur,Two Weeks Ago...,"Two weeks ago, life was quite different. 

Overindulgence and excess, followed by decision paralysis. Office politics washed down with happy hour wine. 

Life was convenient, everything was just fine. 
Mindfulness was a trendy wish, constant reaction is where I lived. 

Out of nowhere...a pandemic explosion! 
Some believe it‚Äôs an overreaction. Others say, it‚Äôs nature‚Äôs correction. 

Within days, borders and boundaries close. Flights cease. The stock market tumbles, and lockdowns increase. 

Quarantined and self-isolation become the new norm. Mother Earth has spoken: it‚Äôs time to stay home. 

Time to rest, reconnect and reset. 
Reach out to loved ones on FaceTime. 
It‚Äôs nice to see their faces instead of just their texts. 

Nature walks are now a daily routine. 
From this solitude and anxiety, forgiveness &amp; gratitude have become a priority. 

While panic-buying and fear mongering continue to go on, one word defines what I‚Äôve become:

Enough.

# That was a beautiful day- The 10th of January, 2020! I will never forget this day.

It was a normal office day for me. I work as a Digital Marketing Analyst at a Growing Startup. I was looking at Search Console Data ( A typical job work for SEO), a notification popped up on my phone.

It was from Quora!

It read like this.

&amp;#x200B;

[Quora Notification of 120k People](https://preview.redd.it/bhyc7lb5g6o41.jpg?width=1041&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d33199aa2637e8b2fe1f19b99344bd60b96f206d)

 

**Quora sent my answer to around 120,000+ people.**

I was very happy to see that notification. My answers are providing value to readers. How satisfying that could be! I kept my phone aside and started doing my usual work.

Came the Next Day!

The Same Story. Again a Notification. This time it was better.

&amp;#x200B;

[Quora Notification of 1 Million People ](https://preview.redd.it/6c6hwf18g6o41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a59d4a0fdf275b7824f7aed6f2a6b624d22e44c)

 

This time it was 1 Million People. I was bamboozled by the number. Started Counting Numbers as a baby would do. Confirmed it was 1 Million, lol. That ecstatic feeling, oh boy!

I felt really satisfied and happy that Quora Sent me this.

Let me not bore you now. Let me show you the next 3 notifications the three consecutive days later.

**Answer Sent to 2.6 Million People!**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Answer Sent to 10 Million People!**

&amp;#x200B;

[Quora Notification of 10 Million People ](https://preview.redd.it/t6tjl0rcg6o41.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af631dd07828a1d43463d5aa1e56d2a93601e99b)

&amp;#x200B;

It was the top of the world feeling.

That day I decided to change my mind. I was about to write a book on Growth Hacking. I decided to write on Quora Marketing and help people leverage the same way I did.

I had previous knowledge and had experimented with multiple things on Quora. Like Running Quora Ads for clients, Running Quora Ads for my products, Being a Micro-Influencer on Quora &amp; Make Money through it, Generated Quality Leads for Clients through content marketing on Quora.

So I thought why not create a value bomb book that teaches people how to do it the exact way I leveraged Quora. The decision was made on that day.

# Breaking Down the Big Task 

That Day when I Went Home. Made a Google Doc. I started Planning on how I would write the eBook.

I have read this line that hooked with me forever. Remember this line whenever you try to do something big.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you want to achieve something big, Divide the Big Task into Small Tasks, Break the Small Tasks into Even Smaller Chunks. Execute Smaller Chunks. Move ahead. Join those smaller tasks and you will eventually achieve the big task!

That‚Äôs what I did!

Jotted down what all Chapters that I can write on. This is the same as Dividing the Big Task ( The Book) into Small Tasks ( Chapters). Now Broke down all Chapters ( Small Tasks ) into Detailed Points ( Smaller Chunks).

This is what I would recommend to anyone.

1. **List the Big Task on a Google Doc.**
2. **Break that Big Task into Small Task**
3. **Divide the Small Tasks into even Smaller Chunks**
4. **Execute the Smaller Chunks one at a time. Move ahead and execute another.**
5. **This will make up for your smaller tasks ( Here this is my chapter)**
6. **This eventual smaller tasks combined will be your achievement of the bigger task. ( In this case, my book)**

*Here‚Äôs a screenshot of my Google Sheet where I have Broke down all the tasks.*

&amp;#x200B;

[Breakdown in Google Sheets](https://preview.redd.it/5daz3wkhg6o41.png?width=1243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34dfbc669876200a4ebf062d363581be902f5ec7)

 

This is how you can create too. The smaller you divide your big task, the easier it would look to you. It will give you more focus rather than thinking about how I will sell 5000 copies.

So I Started Writing without bothering. Now to give you some perspective, I also had a Day job along with this. This eBook was my side project. I wanted to complete it at any cost.

Every time I used to remember this Famous Quote,

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3s1aaiyig6o41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed67dbe9dc794180f9a6213073baf058a312ac62

 

And another quote for some more inspiration,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**It‚Äôs not what you do from 9‚Äì5 that matters the most but what you do from 5‚Äì9 when you come back home! Priorities! Some people will watch Netflix and chill. But if you want to achieve something, then you must bear the short term sacrifices for long term gains. This is what will set you apart from others!**

That was Instant Trigger!

I decided to write at least **2 hours daily and complete at least 3 pages.** That was the promise I made.

I didn‚Äôt let that promise I made to myself down. It worked. I realized that If you set a promise for yourselves and work on it continuously, it eventually becomes a habit.

So I made a habit, that I would write for at least 2 hours and complete 3 pages daily. Even if I am not able to write 3 pages, I would write pointers ( ideas) for my next chapter, so that I won't waste that time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**And after nearly 30 days, I was able to complete nearly 17 Chapters with a word count of nearly 21,221. Remember, I did this while doing my day job. So I needed to be fresh while writing along and not let my low energy speak into the words I am writing.**

&amp;#x200B;

My only focus while writing was, what are the pain points of my audience and how I am going to solve it.

***That‚Äôs it! That was all I was thinking.***

Made a Landing Page in Just a week. Launched it live. Got some testimonials for the initial boost. It was time to make an Ebook Cover.

Initially, I was planning to outsource it to professional designers on Fiverr and Upwork. But time was the constraint. I took the matter in my own hands.

Opened Canva, Made the cover by myself. Some say I did impressive work on the design, even I don‚Äôt have much hand on the design part. I don‚Äôt know, you be the judge.

Anyways, I was glad to do it.

And finally after 30 days and 21,221 words later, I was able to finish my eBook on Quora Marketing

Days later, on launch day I was able to get Rs.10k in sales on the very first day itself. My efforts were rewarded.

My Thoughts on How You Should Approach Big Tasks

You must have had some big projects in mind. The Big Task as I say it.

I would recommend you to not focus much on the Big Task. It looks weird, but its the truth.

Instead, as I said earlier in the post, Divide your Big Task into Smaller Tasks and Smaller Tasks into even Smaller Chunks.

Conquer those smaller chunks day in and day out. Eventually, you would be able to complete those chunks which in turn would help you achieve the big task as we say it.

I did it with the help of a **Simple Google Sheet**, Consistency, Habits, Not letting my mental energy down.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Often it is about your physical energy that affects your mental energy which makes you little demotivated or feel low Because you are feeling tired and helpless due to it.**

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest you take a quick walk or a small sleep to get that energy going. I am focusing on energy here because this is the only thing that will make you more excited and pumped up to achieve your project/big task.

So there you have it. I shared my little story with you and my approach to breaking down big tasks. I would love to hear your story and your side-projects that you are working on.

If you want to check my book on [Quora Marketing](https://gum.co/jhDKn), you can grab it here today.

fmtftj,25vois,"[Discussion] A letter for these uncertain times, from a food service worker.","Hey Reddit.

It's late at night and I've just gotten home from another twelve hour shift. Times are scary. My coworkers and I have all experienced an increase in frustrated customers, who may not realize how their worries are being projected onto us. As expected, sales have increased as we remain one of the few restaurants allowed by the state to stay open and continue serving the 110,000 addresses in our area. And many of us are thankful to be doing just that. We've even been able to hire five people in the last two days as temporary employees during the unexpected closures.

I am 21 years old, half-wishing I could stay at home and catch up on four years of creative work that I haven't been able to touch because of my career. And though I'm extremely grateful that I can continue feeding the thousands of families in my area, and even be able to give jobs to those who are waiting to go back themselves . . . myself and my coworkers are being bombarded by angry customers and a fear that we may become sick ourselves. I know there must be hundreds of you who have been waiting for that kick-in-the-ass to finally write that novel you've been outlining for years; to learn a new language so you can finally hold a conversation with your neighbor; to finish a video game, or book, or television series that inspires you. I know I'd be doing all of this if I finally had time between my shifts.

To those of you who are at home against your will, I encourage you to take advantage of this unfortunate opportunity to put something forth out into the world that makes someone smile. Do it for you. Do it for me. Do it for the emergency service workers; the grocery store employees; the staff in hospitals; the sick people who are scared and feel alone and cooped up. Whether it's sending a message to an old friend to let them know you're thinking of them. Or heading over to [r/redditgetsdrawn](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/) and making someone's day with a doodle. Or even just genuinely thanking the person who delivered your pizza. It goes a long way. It really does.

Want to make me smile? Tell me something you've done to inspire someone who was feeling down.

fmezln,RomanSMironov,[Article] How to Deal with Tough Times (3 Amazing Tips from a Bestselling Author),"Here's an inspiring story of someone who knows how to deal with tough times.

Marc Reklau is a bestselling author of *30 Days - Change your habits, change your life*.

He lived on welfare while writing his first book and knows how to get through the darkest periods.

Here are his lessons learned that will inspire you to stay strong in tough times.

There is also an audio version of this interview with Marc. Check it out here: [https://romanmironov.com/blog/deal-with-tough-times/](https://romanmironov.com/blog/deal-with-tough-times/)

## Dealing with tough times as a teenager

One of Marc Reklau's most difficult periods was from 14 to 16 years.

First, he had problems with his father.

And then his parents divorced and his father died.

Those were tough times but dealing with them shaped him as a person.

30 years later, Marc says *he's grateful for that period because it made him the person he is today*.

## Jobless after college

When Marc graduated from university in 2002, there was a huge crisis in his home country, Germany.

And he was jobless right out of college.

That was quite unexpected because his university was so great.

Everyone used to graduate from it with a job contract.

And suddenly, most graduates were jobless.

Those were difficult times when his friends pitied him.

But *this experience turned out to be a blessing in disguise*.

Marc decided to look for a job in Barcelona, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.

After 9 months, he got a job there.

Suddenly, he was working in one of the greatest cities with a beach and a perfect climate.

And now his friends went from to pitying to envying him.

## Jobless again in 2013

In 2013, Marc got fired after working 11 years for his company.

He felt down but at that point, he already knew how to use reframing in tough times.

So, he took his negative self-talk such as:

I'm jobless, I'm jobless, I'm jobless

And he turned negative into positive:

Not having a job gives me time to think about what I want to do in life.

*This helped him look at the situation from a different perspective.*

To deal with these tough times, he set goals and created an action plan to accomplish them.

## From hopeless to breakthrough

One of his goals was to write a book.

That's how he created his future bestseller *30 Days.*

But after he had published it in August 2014, nothing happened for a long time.

In the meantime, he was living on his savings and jobless welfare of $850.

Finally, in March 2015, his breakthrough came.

He got a promotion on Amazon.

The book reached 40,000 downloads in a couple of days.

## Tip 1: Tough times bring out the best in you

Just like the next guy, Marc loves good times and walks in the park.

But what made him the person he is today is really tough times.

They can bring us down, for sure.

But if we keep believing in ourselves, *they also bring out the best in us*.

## Tip 2: Never give up

Marc was close to giving up many times.

But he kept thinking of a quote by Paulo Coelho:

The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.

When times get hard, you're likely very close to accomplishing your goal.

*You have to trust that the universe wants to test you one more time.*

Whenever Marc thought of giving up, he said to himself, ""Maybe that's the final test? Maybe I need to hang on just a little bit longer?""

And then he pressed on.

Another great quote that helped him never to give up was from Thomas Edison:

The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.

## Tip 3: Learning how to deal with tough times makes you stronger

Dark periods are never nice.

But if you keep getting out of these dark periods, it makes you stronger.

The more often you get up after falling, the easier it gets.

So, the next time, remind yourself that *you've already gone through tough times*.

Why not do it once again?

## About Marc

Marc Reklau is the author of 10 books including the international #1 Bestseller *30 Days - Change your habits, change your life*, which since April 2015 has been sold and downloaded over 200,000 times and has been translated into 15+ languages including Spanish, German, Japanese, Russian, Thai, Indonesian, Chinese, Portuguese and Korean.

He wrote the book in 2014 after being fired from his job and went from jobless to bestseller (which is the title of his second book) and from living on 850$ of jobless welfare to living the life of his dreams.

Marc's mission is to empower people to create the life they want.

He teaches how to develop habits, productivity, and happiness that help deal with tough times.

His message is simple:

*Many people want to change things in their lives but few are willing to do a simple set of exercises.*

You can plan and create success and happiness in your life by developing habits that support you on the way to your goals.

fmc93k,GamerCoachGG,[Text] Call To Adventure,"Friends,

We are living in unprecedented times. 

We would all benefit from remembering Joseph's Campbell's Hero's Journey framework. 

For those unaware, the Hero's Journey is the framework that has been studied in which most great stories from mythology to modern times are based on. 

&gt;*A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.*""- Joseph Campbell in *The Hero With A Thousand Faces*

Typically, this journey is preceded by an ""inciting incident,"" in which the hero is forced to make a difficult decision: Give in to the comforts of the ""Ordinary World"" or answer the Call to Adventure. 

&gt;To encourage \[the\] hero to begin her journey towards greatness, something needs to push her out of her comfort zone. This sudden push is known as the Inciting Incident. Conflict comes from within, or without, and upsets the status quo. -David Safford

So here's the kicker: Without the push outside of the comfort zone, greatness is suffocated and never has the opportunity to reveal itself. 

And that, my friends, is *exactly* what the world is going through right now.

So, what does that have to do with us and what is ""greatness""?

Some people will lose their jobs and will need to skill up and embrace a new identity. They will experience a new and thrilling career and do something they feel more excited about. 

Some people will realize they have gotten out of shape while quarantined. So they will learn to work out at home and they will achieve levels of fitness they never thought were possible for them.

Some people will finally start that business that they have been putting off. They will go online and learn sales, marketing, branding, etc. and will never have to go back to their 9-5 again. 

Some people will realize that their families have grown apart over the years and will make a focused effort to spend meaningful time and engage. They will build family relationships so strong that it will pass on to many generations.

Some people will find ways to help others through this difficult time by donating, volunteering, or simply spreading hope and positivity. This will result in living a life of incredible meaning and purpose.

And yet others, will watch Netflix, play video games, or find other ways to escape from reality. 

The choice is yours. 

Will you answer the Call to Adventure? 

What does ""greatness"" look like to you during this time? Would love to hear in the comments so we can support each other!",0,1584781682,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fmc93k/text_call_to_adventure/,GetMotivated,1

To fall in love with your own self is the main key of your ultimate happiness. You can‚Äôt do everything, however you will definitely do something. So, don‚Äôt refuse to try and do something that you can do easily.

Nothing can stop a person with strong mental attitude from achieving his or, her Goals. So, boost your Self-Esteem properly. Folks with high Self-Esteem are always pleased with what they are doing &amp; they always believe in themselves &amp; their actions. 

High Self-Esteem helps a person to be real not perfect as a result they can understand that original things are worth more than a copy.

fm4gn4,dcfgvbhiuhgytf,[discussion] How to concentrate on work during these interesting times (advice Needed),"Basically the title. I'm a University student, and while all classes have been stopped, everything is being run online, with no change to my deadlines. 

I'm living in a campus dorm; I'm basically confined to a 12ftx8ft box for the next two months. I'm really struggling to concentrate lately; aside from the obviously new stressors, I've spend the last threeish years developing pretty strict study habits across a bunch of study spaces and libraries. My home was somewhere to cook food, and sleep at the end of the day, and relax a bit if I had the time to spare. Now, I've been thrown for a bit of a loop; none of my normal habits work as they rely on distance from each other and my home, and with everything closed, and all my deadlines rapidly approaching, I'm at a loss for where to start.

Does anyone have any advice/tips for working/living/relaxing in the same tiny environment?",5,1584744570,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fm4gn4/discussion_how_to_concentrate_on_work_during/,GetMotivated,1

Here's a podcast I've been listening to that's been really helpful to me: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/zen-habits/id1502459670](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/zen-habits/id1502459670)

Lots of great, authentic advice coming from a person who's been there and done it. I've listened to them all and it's really helping me understand my feelings and thinking, particularly in seeing positives out of progress rather than striving for perfection or nothin.

Looks as though there's a few short episodes per month. I'm listening to it on Apple Podcasts, but I'd guess it's on the other apps too.",0,1584716102,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/flwbma/article_new_inspiring_podcast/,GetMotivated,1

flkvxd,AutoModerator,[Discussion] Post a Picture Thread,"Post a picture of something you have accomplished!  Extra upvotes for before and after pictures.

PZ-01 ""I think it would be cool to have a picture thread once a week where people can show something they have accomplished by TAKING ACTION. It not only is a    testament of fulfilling a task, but a picture is a concrete materialization of said endeavor. I feel like doing something and having a picture to look at later at night gives me a reminder that I did good and I can go to sleep proud.""

Examples: Messy room before/after.  A page of hand written study notes.   A ticked off to-do list.   A picture of a readout from an exercise machine.  A hand written plan for the week.  A picture from the top of a hill you have climbed.  A picture of an email with happy client feedback.   A graph of the number of miles you have walked in the past year.

fldsvx,Southernnnskirt,[Text] 23 things I've learned about life!,"It is so important to self-reflect, and give yourself enough time to retrospect and introspect into yourself and your life. I try to clear my thoughts by putting all my thoughts down, either in a diary/journal when I want it to be personal. Otherwise I just bottle things up which is probably not the best move. So hopefully this helps someone out there!

* Looks are important but they're not everything
* Don‚Äôt compare
* Be compassionate and loving as often as you can
* Always follow your gut
* Making mistakes is important, make more
* Learn from those around you
* People deserve a second chance
* If you don't believe in yourself, no one will
* Your vibe attracts your tribe
* Eating out alone is bliss
* Save more money! You will probably need more than you think
* Patience is a virtue
* Balance is key
* It's about the journey, not the destination
* Get out of your own way, life is what you make of it
* Failure is a detour, not a dead-end
* Walk your own path
* Be flexible with your goals
* Prioritize experiences
* Learn about investing and finances
* Exercise is power
* Grudges cause pain

Welcome to your guide to avoiding negativity, remaining calm and staying focused during this long-ass time.

I am a 31 year old self confessed mess, take this guide as someone who is just trying to help others in a lighthearted way during this panic-demic we're all experiencing.

Below you will find a number of resources that will help keep your mind at ease, keeping you busy and distracted from a lot of bull shit media - causing panic through fake news, social media trends and all round human ignorance. 

Everyone is in this together and you are not alone.

Also a special shout-out to Russel Brand and his YouTube channel who provides interesting insights into all this, while still being an absolute joker and natural poet. He's really helped me look at things differently and sort whats important in my thinking, to what is invaluable noise from the 'panicked population' 
https://www.youtube.com/user/russellbrand 

It's important more than ever to keep our minds busy and distracted from a constant bombardment of negative, fear-inducing news. My recommendation during this time is to stick to a 3-step programme to help keep our minds at ease.

I call this the 3 M's:
Mindfullness
Meditation
Masturbation

I hope this guide helps you, and please remember to share your positivity and resources with those in need.

Listen mate, I'm a mental health sufferer of 15+ years from clinical depression and anxiety, I don't take medication, I just practise good mental health through - and here's that word again...POSITIVITY, and do you think whats happening right now is scaring me? It's not, what's scaring me is the ignorance, so just open your minds and we can all wait this out together.

Spread the word, spread love and kindness, because right now that's all we can do until this blows over - which it will.",2,1584626621,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/flaixs/text_a_light_hearted_guide_to_dealing_with_life/,GetMotivated,1

fkwm1j,awardwinninggames,"How to ""Feel Like it"" - Get motivated/stay motivated - Right now [Article][Tool]","Day 1 - Feel like it. A Concise and effective way to get inspired and stay inspired, to develop discipline, and be motivated.. even if you have never been able to before. 

You wanna write a book, start a business, play an instrument, or really do anything elaborate that's going to take sustained vision and perseverance?

Start with method building and by adding a DEDICATED mindfulness routine to your life. 

I.e. A system for developing systems. Spend 20 minutes, every single day thinking ""what would make my life and or day... amazing?"" 

This is the lynchpin of success, getting started, and developing the life you want.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**First ""bite"" or exercise:**  
Open this link in a new tab:  [https://tomato-timer.com/](https://tomato-timer.com/) \- then hit ""start timer"" (while reading this, it's okay, reading this counts, or you could also use a timer on your phone set to 25 minutes if that works better)

You've just taken the first step to develop the motivation and discipline you need to do the things you've always wanted to do. 

Now open a google document or a word document or something, and title it something fun and interesting. Mines called ""A riot of the soul"". Yours could be called that, or whatever you feel like. ""My Perfect Life"", ""Hu-rah - Let's do this"", ""Party at the end of the world"", ""Pomodoros"", ""A life well lived"", ""Passion in all things"", ""Practicality efficiency"", ""Starting A Rock band"", etc.

What would make your life and or day... awesome? Go with something around those lines. What is it you want most? (Go with your gut or first impulse, you can come back and refine or change it later)

Now write today's date. Now put the number 1. and then next to it write ""Develop a system to make daily progress towards things I love, and want most in my life"". Take a second to think if you could repeat this simple process, at least once a day, EVERY DAY, for the next 21 days. If the answer is yes, then next to that sentence put a dash, and write -Done.  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's go for a little extra credit since you probably finished with some time left on your timer.

Next, put the number two. You're going to spend the rest of your current timer thinking about what you want most in your life and something easy and fun you can do in that direction.

The stages of planning, tracking, recording, processing and visualizing are fundamental to this technique, so if you're just starting out, your number 2 will probably be something along the lines of ""Figure out what you want to do"", then you'll refine from there.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EXAMPLE:**

If you're me - Recently single for the first time in a long time, with a desire to be a motivational speaker, professional writer, and also go on a date: My goal for yesterday was ""write one article, and then use it to try to get a laugh and or a date"". 

My focus for yesterday was neuroplasticity, brain function, and nutrition. A girl I met on a dating app that I've been talking to for a few days was asking me about it, so I linked her an excerpt from an article I was reading: ""another large study found that women who ate nuts regularly over the course of several years had a sharper memory, compared to those who didn't eat nuts"". Eating nuts was also linked to improved cognitive performance. I got both a good laugh and a date for next weekend.

Moral of the story, have fun with your goals and projects, and you'll stay motivated and continue to make progress. Make it an adventure.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
If anyone needs help thinking of their goal just drop me a comment with the title or feel you want for your second action item, and I'll help you brainstorm ""Have more friends"", ""make more money"", ""quit my job"", ""join the circus"", ""start a business from home"", ""become a performing artist"", ""write a book"" (all good examples, and also things I've done.).

fkt4kv,awardwinninggames,21-day motivation challenge &amp; The science of motivation [Article][Discussion][Tool],"Day 1 - Feel like it. You wanna write a book (or really do anything elaborate, that's going to take sustained vision)

Start with method building and by adding a DEDICATED mindfulness routine to your life. 

I.e. A system for developing systems. Spend 20 minutes, every single day thinking ""what would make my life and or day... amazing?"" 

This is the lynchpin of success and developing the life you want.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Tip 1 - Make your goals exciting, and then concrete. WRITE IT DOWN. Put the date, and title it with what you want most in the world. Then make at least one ""bite-size goal"" every day, and do it. 

If you, for example, are out of practice and have difficulty staying motivated. Your brain feels mushy or you have writer's block... the title of your first ""Pomodoro"" (or 20 minute sit down) should be ""Feel like it"". (or maintain inspiration, perspective, and drive)

Tip 2 - How to make the change - The human mind works on something called ""bio rhythms"" and ""brain states"". It's just more precise/complicated language for the way your body naturally functions (sleeping being a good example of both a biorhythm and brain state, R.E.M. Sleep being an example of your mind cycling to another brain state). 

How can you use this? - Understanding the basic functions of the human mind will allow you to build and optimize a routine.

The human attention span, memory, everything... is pretty much hardwired like this.

A good rule of thumb for calculating biorhythms is you just double them. So if you wanna keep a person's attention, you need to be interesting in the first 7-15 seconds, then again in the next 30. Be interesting 3 times in a minute, and you'll have them ""zoned in"" by establishing an interesting pattern.

Yay! Now do this with yourself. 

For me, I have recently become single. SO: The title of my mindfulness practice for the day is called ""A riot of the soul"".

My bitesize goal for the day is to write one ""interesting piece"", and then hit on this girl that I just met with it. See if I can impress her. I'll know it's good if she responds with nudes. lol :D

Whatever your goals are, make sure to have fun with them, and you'll keep doing them. Make them memorable. Make them exciting. This is how you build a joyful life you love, and habits you can keep even when life gets difficult. Be amazing, then just be yourself. Have fun, keep an open mind, and stay focused on where you wanna go and your life will naturally aline in that direction.

Imagine this for a second:

What if you woke up every day with an undeniable sense of hope and excitement? Started your day with purpose, passion, motivation and tons of interesting things that you loved to do?

\----------------------------------------------------------------

**Biorhythms charts and when to refocus and be aware** \- 1 day, 3 days, 5-7 days, 14 days, and 21 days are your markers for a special amount of mindfulness. 

i.e. Most people give up their new year's resolutions around 12-14 days. It's when people tend to get bucked by old habits and life. SO: Set a reminder on your calendar for a 14-day celebration and rededication.

Keep going, even when you get off track. It‚Äôs super easy to do, and happens to everyone. It's totally fine. Just MAKE SURE TO KEEP YOUR 20 MINUTE MINDFULNESS ROUTINE. As a bare minimum. That's it. You can do 20 minutes, and it'll be well worth it. 

The only difference between those who usually succeed, and those who don‚Äôt, is the mindset to continue to try. Keep going, have fun with it, great creative, and your success is inevitable.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of a ""bitesize bit"" I drew lines in this article so you could see. I got a little carried away. This ""bit about bites"" is gonna be the 4th. My goal was to do 3 short bits, but when you're feeling it, it's okay to be more productive.

I'm going to call it 1 long bit, 2 short bits, and a p.s.

p.s. Find an accountability partner, who you‚Äôre comfortable with. Someone you can share your progress with, that‚Äôll help keep you motivated. Have an online meeting, or lunch somewhere with them, once a week. It‚Äôll drastically improve your productivity and consistency \[by 95% in some studies\]

SO - If you wanna post the title of your ""mindfulness"" practice for today, and a quick excerpt of the first ""bitesize"" thing you're going to do, and or ""something funny or interesting"". Might be a good start. Posting this counts as a ""bite"". So you will have taken ""two bites"" today if you also do the thing you're excited about. (should take about 10-20 minutes)

(If enough people like this article, I'll be happy to write one of the next in this series. 1. ""How to: Have the audacity to believe in yourself and your work."" - 2. ""Breaking Bad habits - even when you don't feel like it"" - 3. ""How to get your power lvl over 9,000"")

Also, if you want 3 more talking points on this article, I have plenty more, just let me know what you're most interested in. Ask questions, thumbs up, etc. I'll do a new piece on the exponential scale, so if you appriacte this... HELP ME STAY MOTIVATED. I need it too :)

I'll do a new article at 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, and 1,000 likes etc.",1,1584551634,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fkt4kv/21day_motivation_challenge_the_science_of/,GetMotivated,3

But what I also want to say is that we should be careful not to over indulge ourselves in such a way that the negative news begins to harm us by increasing our stress levels. 

Fear, anxiety and the likes are one of the greatest triggers of stress, and stress harms our immune system which further makes us susceptible to several illnesses.

fknlfu,moonmuaaz,[text]Dont Be Afraid To Fail,"Two stories to begin with:
1. Nokia refused Android
2. Yahoo refused Google

Lesson:-
1. Take risks.
2. Embrace changes.
3. If you refuse to change with time, you might perish.

Two more stories:
1. Facebook takes over whatsapp and instagram.
2. Grab takes over Uber

Lesson:
1. Become so powerful that your competitors become your allies.
2. Reach the top position and then eliminate the competition.
3. Keep innovating.

Two More stories:
1. Colonel sanders founded KFC at the age of 65.
2. Jack Ma, who couldn't get job in KFC, founded Alibaba.

Lesson:
1. Age is just a number
2. Only those who keep trying succeeds

Last but not the least:
1. Lamborghini was founded as result of revenge of a tractor owner who was insulted by Enzo Ferrari, the founder of Ferrari

Lesson:
1. Never underestimate anyone, ever!!
2. Success is the best revenge.

‚úîÔ∏èJust keep working hard.
‚úîÔ∏èInvest your time wisely.

fk15ss,F4810,How to spend your ( Social Isolation ) time,"Many people are dreading the idea of being stuck home for an extended period of time, but it has to be done.  I would like to propose a challenge.  #challengeyourself 

Make this time a time for you, for your family, and for your future.  Create a list of all the things you would like to do if you had all the time in the world to do while being at home.  Workout for that summertime bod, write that book, bond w your kids, create that family tree, clean out your entire home in an epic spring cleaning, rearrange/decorate like you've always meant to do, learn something new through online courses, read all those books on your shelf you've never read, tailor your clothes, paint/repair ( with proper ventilation of course), teach your children something new,  create that epic photo album/book,  start that blog/blog/stream/podcast, finish that screenplay once and for all, get in touch with old friends through video chats, learn a new language, make a lamp...the sky's the limit (as long as you already have the supplies) 

While we are all worried about our health and that of our friends, family and loved ones, this will pass, and hopefully you and they will all be ok. While we wait this out, this is an opportunity to grow.  Commit to your list. Complete it. Use this time wisely. You may come out of it with a deep feeling of accomplishment.

TL/DR: while waiting out the coronavirus during social isolation, use your time to finally do those things you always wished you had time to do.",0,1584430359,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fk15ss/how_to_spend_your_social_isolation_time/,GetMotivated,1

fjlu2k,Holyshitspace,Help. Please. [Story],"I'm writing this from my bed, pretty much the only place I've been for the last days. This is kind of a last ditch effort to maybe find a solution I haven't seen or tried before.

I've completely given up. On myself, my life, my dreams, the world, everything. I used to have this mighty spark, optimism, dreams and a very romantic view of the world and my future. Then, at 16, I got my heart thoroughly broken by my first boyfriend (this was 2013). It was all downhill from there. Sure, the descent wasn't linear, I was severely depressed for two years, but kind of up and down since then.

Ever since christmas it's been going steadily downhill and now I'm at the bottom. And not just mentally. I am no closer to achieving my dream of becoming a physicist than I was 5 years ago when I graduated HS. I've tried again and again to finish the maths I need to start a physics bachelor, but I always give up. And not because it's hard, I understand everything. I just. Stop trying.

I give up on everything. I have never been able to keep a workout regiment going, nor have I ever had a job I'm good at or content with. I have few friends because most moved away and rarely reach out. I don't get along too well with the ones I have here. One of them recently told me I'm a very negative person. I think she's right.

I don't know what to do, please help. I'm 23 and I feel like I'm starting on the very bottom. No matter which thread I pick up and try, I never stick with it. I haven't been able to make progress with anything since I was 16. I just feel completely lost and hopeless.

For those who will ask, yes I was seeing a psychologist through my uni. That all shut down because of Corona. The whole quarantine situation has made everything so much worse. I don't know what I need or if I'll even find it here. Maybe I'm just one of those weak people who can't handle life in this world.",14,1584369040,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fjlu2k/help_please_story/,GetMotivated,1

So yeah i've been isolated at home for 2 days because im scared to go outside since im in the % of people who are more susceptible to get it worst because of previous disease. 

Im loosing my mind. Im only eating pasta, i talk to my friends on discord and games and watch stuff but living in a small appartment really do a number on me, i can't fathom people in Wuhan or Italy being quarantine for weeks/months.

fj7qrn,sylsau,"[Discussion] If you want to be successful, you have to give more than you receive","Success in life is never really random.

Successful people put themselves in a position to make great things happen to them.

This involves giving more than they receive.

The goal is to always try to give more to others. The more you give to others in a totally selfless way, the more useful you will be, and the more great things will happen to you.

So the first thing is always to seek to give more value to others.

This is the best way to be successful in life.

I share my position in more detail in the following article: [**https://medium.com/publishous/the-most-successful-people-give-more-than-they-receive-4ce6fcf284d5**](https://medium.com/publishous/the-most-successful-people-give-more-than-they-receive-4ce6fcf284d5)

fit05m,jaxastrophe,"Too many interests and can't decide, wasting my life procrastinating","I'm turning 29 years this year. Just a year ago, I would have characterised myself as a failure: like 3 months of job experience overall (as a cashier), a Bachelor's of English literature, and no skills. Not a musical instrument, no hobbies, no nothing. I'm wasting my life on the computer day after day.

Now I'm a little better, working on a Degree in computer science. I already have some marketable skills like programming knowledge, and I'm very good at data structures and algorithms. Still, I spend most of my days moping around at home and not being very productive.

I'm interested in the following things: psychology (preferably I want a degree), teaching at university (probably comp sci), math (I wanna learn more but would also prefer a degree), learning a musical instrument, singing, theatre, public speaking, psychedelic research, philosophy, and more.

My studies are currently going well. But as for any other of these things, I just can't stay focused! I know how much time and dedication I need to put in but my attention is all over the place. Working on the degree is the only thing keeping me focused on programming and math, thank god. But I'd like to be more involved in the academia, and make professional networks.

That's another problem. Networking. Socialising. I have like zero confidence and most times, going to any events is a pain. I'm just not motivated. I'd much rather read a book. Still, I find myself often thinking about how much it would enrich my life to have more people and opportunities available to me.

So two questions:

1. How do I pick an interest and stay committed to it, so I can confidently say, in a few years' time, that I at least have some expertise on this topic? We'll disregard computer science and math studies, because I'm working on those with gusto anyways.
2. How do I get more motivated to find more people and social oppurtunities in my life? Sitting at home is comfortable, but one day I might find that a life of such comfort has been dull and I could've lived much more excitingly if I had just found the will to do it.",0,1584233711,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fit05m/too_many_interests_and_cant_decide_wasting_my/,GetMotivated,1

Forming a habit of meditation is something which I have personally struggled with. As someone who had meditated enough to realize its value, I was unhappy that I couldn't a form of a habit of meditating consistently. One of the reasons for that had been that my approach towards change didn't match with the science of forming habits.

We are always obsessed with motivation to help us stick to a behaviour, whereas habit building tells us that it requires more than just motivation. Ease of performing the habit and routine based reminders also matter equally. Science tells us that motivation is the most unreliable factor in habit formation.

In order to solve for this, after having spent months on research around habit building \[ Tiny Habits, Atomic Habits , The power of habit etc\], I have finally built a beta version of an app which aims to form a life-long habit of meditation for its users. It incorporates all the three factors responsible for habit formation.

I believe it would be a great help for people who want to stay motivated for meditation without relying just on motivation.

filfcd,SoonhyunBan,[Tool] I made a neuroscience app that helps you break bad habits into healthy ones.,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys!

Last year, I started a journey to break various bad habits (sleeping late, smoking, no soda) utilizing neuroscience protocols. The data from that social experiment proved the importance of finding a ‚ÄúTrigger‚Äù. We know that all habits have specific triggers and replacing/removing them with something positive is the key.

My issue was sleeping late. The trigger was my phone and YouTube. To replace/remove the trigger, I moved the power outlet, charger, and phone to the living room and turned it off. This method was ‚Äúsuper effective‚Äù.

A friend of mine went through a similar project. Her problem was that she'd take a blunt on her way home after work, at a specific location. Her trigger was a physical location that initiated smoking, so I advised her to use a different path and purchase some vitamin water as a reward. Recently, I haven‚Äôt seen her take a puff once.

This trigger protocol worked great, but it was extremely difficult to help hundreds of strangers through advice and YouTube videos. That‚Äôs why, as some of you already know, I teamed up with a group of scientists and developers to make a useful tool. Our plan was to create a neuroscience-based habit platform where you can find relatable problems and solutions and apply scientific protocols to break bad habits.

We released an early version and got your feedback. The app had many holes. Many features were lacking. But the data was in. With your help, the devs are now passionately at work, while I‚Äôm focusing on brain hacks that you can use in real life.

Current features:

* Image based card feed interface
* Quickly create Pattern(habit) cards that include: images / journals /¬†*observer*¬†/ goals (days, weeks)
* Invite others to observe each Pattern for accountability and sharing
* Gain reward (Neurons) every time you follow through with a report
* Level up by gathering neurons
* Each time you level up, we donate to ‚ÄúCure Alzheimer's Fund‚Äù
* Track your Pattern goals(obviously)
* Neuroscience protocols applied for all of the above features

Future:

* Discover relatable triggers and solutions of other people to transform your bad habit into healthy ones
* Group habits and solutions for others to participate

fhyjx5,Dylansigley,Drop Servicing ‚Äì How I Became Successful In 93 Days,"&amp;#x200B;

![video](kaydxzcojfm41)

I got my first two clients in January of 2016 and it was really the most amazing moment, I remember walking home from work and just see the notifications pop up on my phone. Craziest feeling ever and that first sale you get is always the best one, every sale after that just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. But even with these successes, there was still a lot of challenges coming in. I was successful at that stage, I had a working online business and it was driving sales but I decided I wanted to leave job, so I could focus more hours on it and I ended up moving in back with my mom for a little while, building this business.  

Few months later, I attended an event for this course in Las Vegas, came back with some cool strategies and implemented those. And from there my business really skyrocketed. I made my first $10,000 in a month and it just kept going up and up from there. I ended up moving out of my mom‚Äôs house finally and traveling the world, went to so many countries, I was traveling all over Europe. But they were a lot of challenges too, I wasn‚Äôt used to this whole freedom lifestyle of traveling the world and I felt like I was partying a little bit too much, enjoying myself too much, not really focusing on my business, because I didn‚Äôt really need to at that point. Everything was basically automated. üëáüíª

It not only is a    testament of fulfilling a task, but a picture is a concrete materialization of said endeavor.

fhdd1m,pallennellap,You're so great,"Hi guyz just want to share my life and how it works everyday. Im not here because i want to become famous. Im here because i just want to share how miserable life is and how great you're life more than me. Haha guyzz im so sorry im not common in english so please forgive me haha. So let's start. First of all I'm a gay. Everything's fine in my life until my parents separated because the problem of money. For short we're all at my mother side. I have 3 older sisters and im the only boy haha. And when im in grade 8 (im grade 9 now) that's the start of my biggest nightmare and problem's in life. Im grade 8 that time when my friends are starts to hurt me (not in physical but emotional) they always bad words to me. Btw we're 6 in our group. The 2 of them is my real friends. But the one who's always bullying me is the one who destroyed me. Like she's always saying that im ugly because of my acne she's always saying that im idiot because sometimes i cant understand when she's speaking english (she trained in their house that's why she's fluent in english) and more. She is the reason why i lost my confidence. Im broke that time but i can't open to my mother and sister because you know that time they start to be my problem because you know im really an idiot haha. My 3 older sisters have an honor,medal, and award. While me dont have academic award even one. But my grades are not low its just fine or exact in a normal student haha. That's why my mother's attention is always on my older sister who have an honor (My 2 older sisters are finished studying) and its really kills me. Im getting jealous that time because my older sister's have an attention of my mother she always got what she wants while me yeah i got what i want too but you know there's always have a harsh words before i got it. Yes i got what i want but its not the same as my sister. I can't say to them that im not okay because im scared that they will judge me that im so dramatic like what happened right now. Now that im grade 9 everything went change was changed. Im lucky on my friends (we're 7 members in our group and they are not my friends when im grade 8) im so lucky to have them because i can open to them in my family problem. Because you know im really different now in my family. They think im trash and as the day passed its getting worse. Their words can kill me outside. Everyday before the day passed you will hear from them the word idiot and stupid. Its fun right? The people who do you think that will help you is the reason that will kill you. One day my firstborn sister said that i and my friends are flirty even though we didn't do anyting. Im just shocked that time because she said that even though i didn't do anything. Im just doing that time is cleaning the house(we're the responsible for that because my mother is working) i always following what she command but i dont get it that she's still angry that time. She just said you're stupid and idiot. Economics? Really did you failed that simple subject? (i didn't passed it because i didnt passed my project that time because im absent and my teacher domt want to accept it when i attended school) You're such a shame! I didn't answer her because im adept (is the word right? Haha sorry if im wrong) im always hearing that everyday so its just a word that will destoy me little by little. When im not answering to her she's thinking a reason to make me destroyed. You and you're friends y'all flirty. That time i answered her i said no were not. I always repeat that when she always saying that were flirty. That's why she come closer to me and said what did you say? No were not i said. Then she slapped me. I repeat that 3 times then she slapped me 3 times. When she left i start crying i said that my respect for you is bigger than my respect to myself then you just think that im a trash haha how funny. ""Where's my elder sister who have concern in me when im at the young age who always say sorry when she said to me a bad words? Who always taught my lesson when i didn't get it. Who always there when im sad. Where is she? Then my elder sister replied. You're so dramatic. Then my second sister said. Stop it dont answer her you know that she's mad youre still answering her. I replied that how i can't answer when she says is not true? It is wrong if i defending my self and my friends? She's saying that we're flirty even we're not do you think its right? She said just stop answering her you know she's not in her mood! I said, so it's ok to say a bad words when she's mad? Then after i do what i do i go in the cr then i start to cry quietly. After i cried a lot I prepared myself because I'll go to my mother's job that time and stay there for a while. Then when Im close at my mother's job I stay outside for a while to cry I dont care if someone's caught me crying. Im just thinking that time that I need to release it because when the time come that I'll say to my mother what happened I will not cry but Im wrong. When im telling what happened in our house i started crying. But you know what? She said that its your fault because you dont study well and youre not following what she's saying. Then i replied, Im always following her i dont know why she's angry. Then my mom was silent. That time i felt that even I am right I never win. When it comes to favoritism I always lose. My mom was so perfect rhe only mistake she made was me haha. And that's my life's works. There is no day she's not angry when we're cleaning our house. When she and her boyfriend fighthing sometimes when she saw me she will search a reason to put out her anger to me. I dont know why. So when you read this maybe youre in a better life than me or not. Whether youre depressed or stress. Keep it up you can do it. Youre soooooo greattt. You're beautiful outside and inside always remember that. If I can surpass my problem you can do it ok? I trust you. Dont let people overthrow you. Im not active in church but trust me. God has a better plan to you. Make your problem as your inspiration to success. God just training our faith. Its not the end. Always pray. Your life is not a movie dont end it.",0,1584003358,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fhdd1m/youre_so_great/,GetMotivated,1

fh7ry3,IShouldBeDoingHWK,[Text] I've been lying to myself and I don't know what to do,"Today I realized that in all actuality I am nobody. I have no truly close friends, I'm emotionally distant with most of my family, I have no hobbies and I might get fired from my job.

I have nothing to show for who I am or who I've been. All life I've assumed we all naturally grown and learn from our mistakes and we just figure out things as we go, and hopefully reach something really good one day, but I'm static. I'm not growing in any way in life. I want to be somebody but I don't know where to start. Deep down I'm scared of the world because it's too real.

I've always shunned people out emotionally not because I want to but because I don't know how to connect with them. I overthink everything to the point where it's stressing me out.

I wish I got out of the house more and had people to hang out with, but my dad has taught me to be afraid because there's always a chance something bad might happen. He's a pessimist.

I don't even wanna be somebody for the world, I wanna be somebody for me. Have my own little life with people I love and doing things I like. I'm not even sure where to start.

My family has been nothing to me but an emotional downhill. All they do is complain about each other all day. It has always been like this.

I've broken down emotionally before but today has been the worse. All I want is to grow and have a happy little life in this world but I'm not sure where to start. I don't feel like I'm ready for any of it.

Any advice I can get will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",17,1583974107,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fh7ry3/text_ive_been_lying_to_myself_and_i_dont_know/,GetMotivated,1

fgzut2,relderpaway,"[Tool][Request] Tool for building ""motivation board"" (browser based)?","Hey, not sure where else to ask this, so what I would like is to be able to set up some sort Digital Motivation board, so basically a screen where the primary goal is to have it cycle through things that motivate me or things I Want to keep in mind throughout the day and then hang that somewhere in my apartment.

In terms of hardware I've been through a few different Ideas but I think I've landed on using a chrome cast + screen, but that still leaves the software.

Given that its' being streamed through chrome cast I figure something browser based is the best solution. Optimally this would be something that allows you to easily drop in things like pictures, text snippets etc (from a different device than the device doing the streaming?) and create screens that it will cycle through, it would also be great if it has more interactive configurations, for example the ability to include countdowns towards specific dates, or maintaining streaks. Additional bonus points if it has integrations like IFTTT.

One thing that comes to mind for me which might sort of work is Notion, but hoping someone can suggest a tool that is a bit more specialised towards what I'm looking for.",1,1583944067,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fgzut2/toolrequest_tool_for_building_motivation_board/,GetMotivated,1

ffvcj1,JohnnyHaldric,[Text] The call to adventure,"Nature calls us to adventure and it is accurately represented across cultures.  
Heroes were born from it, great civilizations were built from it, Abraham listened to it and so did your ancestors who migrated and left their homeland.

  
Each and every one of us is constantly invited to reflect upon our lives and change it. We are challenged to leave our comfort zones at the penalty of stagnation and immaturity by failing to do so.  


Change is scary. Fear can easily dominate us, thus courage is expected. But a hero is brave not because he lacks fear but because he doesn‚Äôt allow it to dominate his essence. Similarly, you should be a hero and listen to your call to adventure, and base this call primarily in true. You can shine light into this world, but only if you leave the darkness.

  
And maybe, after all, you don‚Äôt necessarily have to be the hero, but at least you should aim at it.",0,1583763610,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/ffvcj1/text_the_call_to_adventure/,GetMotivated,1

ff28g1,rubberarrow,"[Discussion] What do you think of ""Guided Motivation"" as an app?","Hey Reddit! 

I'm working on a mobile app for motivational audio, and wanted to share with you all. The idea is there isn't a great app for when you're looking for a quick way to get pumped for the day. Whether it be on the way to the gym, an important meeting, or even going on a date, I want to feel confident and motivated.

Apps like Calm and Headspace do a great job of getting you to feel balanced mentally. I'd love to create something that people use, that is similar, but for pushing them to reach their goals.

I'd love if you guys could check out my [website](https://www.getmotivated.app), and give me some feedback! (If you sign up, there's some example audio, but I could the link here too: [https://soundcloud.com/user-150501250/jay-z-motivated-audio-app-preview/s-xIijN](https://soundcloud.com/user-150501250/jay-z-motivated-audio-app-preview/s-xIijN))

Some questions: What type of content excites you? In what contexts would you like to have ""guided motivation""? Does it matter to you, who is giving the message (if you find them inspirational or not)? 

Let me know in the comments, or sign up and I'll email you!

Most important for me:

* add recurring (with frequency) and one-time tasks
* check off done tasks and mark failed tasks / move failed to the next day/week/month if one-time and not recurring

Less important, but I like to do:

* rate the day, week, month with a ""score"" that I can try to beat. In the simplest form, 1 item is 1 point.",4,1583590637,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fevo4l/tool_spreadsheet_or_software_for_recurring_and/,GetMotivated,1

I don't have actual stickers or aboard and I literally have no resources , so I'm going to have to do this with my computer. There's a lot of stuff I like so I think someone making me a board would help and I'll make you a board based on your interests. I'm not sure if there would be a reward system but I think at least for me the stickers would be enough to see pop up everyday. We could also be venting Buddies if we were on at the same time. I'm usually on at this time and for the next maybe 10 hours if that works preferably someone who's around long-term though. A lot of times I brush off doing things to take care of myself especially things my disability does not stop me from doing without any problems. I guess I'm just not motivated. There's a lot of stuff I should be doing even hobbies that I'm losing interest in but I know I need to force myself to do them particularly practicing my writing because if I don't force myself to work past my disability it just gets harder and harder for me. Hopefully I can do the same for you even if it's something as simple as brushing your teeth or it could be like your entire life. Maybe we can make like small assignments for each other unless it's something that we physically cannot do or don't have the resources for, no pressure since a lot of its optional on my end but it would be nice to get that sticker or some praise",0,1583559243,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/feqt5c/text_20r_seeking_accountability_buddy_where_we/,GetMotivated,1

So it's nice that weekends are text post only. But I'd still like to see other forms of motivation such as Articles, Videos, and whatever getting more attention.

So I suggested we amend the rules so that weekends are not self-post only, but merely \[Image\] free. That way articles and videos and other stuff also have a chance to surface.

PZ-01 ""I think it would be cool to have a picture thread once a week where people can show something they have accomplished by TAKING ACTION. It not only is a    testament of fulfilling a task, but a picture is a concrete materialization of said endeavor. I feel like doing something and having a picture to look at later at night gives me a reminder that I did good and I can go to sleep proud.""

Examples: Messy room before/after.  A page of hand written study notes.   A ticked off to-do list.   A picture of a readout from an exercise machine.  A hand written plan for the week.  A picture from the top of a hill you have climbed.  A picture of an email with happy client feedback.   A graph of the number of miles you have walked in the past year.

fdq76u,fineapplemcgee,Lazy? Or unmotivated? Is there a difference? Please help!! [Discussion],"So I don‚Äôt think I am lazy. But sometimes I feel like I MUST be otherwise I would do a lot more things.

I (30F) work all the time. I pick up doubles as much as I can and for a few months I was working 7 days a week with 3-4 doubles every week. And when I am at work, I hustle- I do my side work, help other people with their work; if I can help, I do help. Furthermore, I am a waitress so my entire day is spent on my feet walking around. But I don‚Äôt care- I‚Äôll stay late, come in early- whatever they need, I‚Äôm there.

BUT. I am obese. I can‚Äôt stop eating. I have zero hobbies because when I go home, all I do is sit on my couch. I barely take care of myself. I struggle to do the bare minimum like shower regularly or brush my teeth everyday. I WANT to do these things- eat healthy, exercise regularly, pursue hobbies, take care of myself. I want to be proud of who I am and how I live my life. But I just can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know if I am actually lazy or unmotivated or what it is but it literally feels impossible to do these things an I‚Äôm starting to get scared for how the rest of my life looks if I can‚Äôt change.

I do not want to wake up 10 years from now, 5 years from now, even a year from now and be this same person. If all I do is work and sit on my couch forever, you might as well kill me now because that is not a life worth living. I have zero quality of life because I don‚Äôt experience anything except work and Netflix. 

And I make all these lists about what I‚Äôll do different to change, but the second I get home, I‚Äôm eating garbage and watching TV. It actually feels very overwhelming to change all of these things about who I am and how I currently live my life. 

I used to love to read as a kid, but I don‚Äôt read anymore.

I want to learn to decorate cakes and cookies because I think I‚Äôd be really good at it, but whenever I actually have time to do it, it seems like so much work.

I want to exercise and be healthy again and not let food control my every thought.

I enjoy eating healthy food, but I feel like I‚Äôm addicted to sugar and processed foods because they are on my mind constantly, and even when I tell myself I won‚Äôt eat cake- fast forward five minutes to the spoon in my hand shoveling cake in my mouth. I will literally be full and thoughts of food will flood my mind until I eat again like an hour later!! That‚Äôs crazy.

And I‚Äôll do good for like a week at a time where I take care of myself and I ride a bike to work and back everyday, but it is always random and inspired by nothing (like I never start after I make all these lists and plans for how I‚Äôm going to change- I just wake up one day and do things better), and it always ends just as suddenly.

I don‚Äôt want to live like this anymore. I have so much potential and I want to do so many things but how do I be less lazy/more motivated?? What have you guys done to help you improve your quality of life? Sorry my post is all over the place, but I‚Äôm at my wits end and I‚Äôm frantic to change and I need real solutions.

Please no answer like ‚Äòjust do it‚Äô because if it was that easy, believe me, I would have done it already.",23,1583384332,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fdq76u/lazy_or_unmotivated_is_there_a_difference_please/,GetMotivated,1

fdbgty,CoachTryumph,"[Story] I didn't come this far, to only come this far.","Hi I am going to tell you my personal story not to get pity or self-promotion, but to hopefully inspire someone. I will keep it as short as possible.

I grew up in Kenya where life was quite good we had a big house 5 cars, a maid, cook, gardener, security guard, so life was really good. However, when I was around 9yo things started changing due to a recession in Kenya and within a year or so we(my family) were sleeping at relatives in cramped houses on the floor. I was then kicked out of school (we could not afford school fees) without saying bye to my friends when.  I was then out of school for about 3 years had to learn from my younger cousins books.

Moved to the UK when I was 14 then got back into education, I always wanted to be an Engineer but my A-Levels were B.E.E so I had to do a Foundation year at University. But I grinded through and eventually, I graduated with my Master's degree in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering. I then got a job before graduating at American Conglomerate GE where I worked on both the Royal Navy Aircraft Carriers. However after 5 years I felt unfulfilled at work and felt depressed so I decided to quit my well paying job and do something else, I did not know what it would be. I went solo travelling and worked on my self for a year before finding my purpose.

**Re cap:**

* **Sleeping on the floors of relatives houses.**
* **Kicked out of school for 3 Year, without saying bye to friends.**
* **Achieving buzzingly low A-Levels B.E.E.**
* **Unhappy and depressed with life and career, but decided to do something about it.**
* **Took a year of solo-travelling and self-discovery to find my purpose and the next chapter of my life.**

So no matter what challenges you come across you can get through them, and when you feel like all is lost because of low grades, achievements or performance you can still change and improve and if you are not happy with where you are in life then make a change, try and do something different or new. 

It will take time but the first step is accepting you are not where you want to be, wanting to be better and doing something about it.

I know they are people who have been through worse situations, but a lot of people like to complain about life have and not really do anything about it.",0,1583320023,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fdbgty/story_i_didnt_come_this_far_to_only_come_this_far/,GetMotivated,1

fcs7sv,Jcotilla,Growth: A tale of two mindsets,"If there is something I remember from my student years, was that I always put teachers in two types of groups: the supporters and the detractors. Or, as a young-me would say: the ones that believe in me and the ones that think that I am not good enough and will never be. At first, I did not understand what it meant, but it certainly had an impact on how I learned and stayed motivated throughout my studies (and life). Why would there be a professional in Education telling me that I can do better next time, while there were others telling me that I should give up on this or that? 

That leads me to the question: How can you turn failure into the key of your own success? How much you can accomplish once you are not afraid of failure? I share my story in ""[Growth: A tale of two mindsets](https://bit.ly/38kegee)"". 

[https://bit.ly/38kegee](https://bit.ly/38kegee)

And you, what do you choose? What is your mindset? How do you reflect back when you were in school and how does it compare to the ‚Äútoday-you‚Äù?

fcrnk6,Opspin,App for motivation/encouragement [Discussion],"TL:DR Do you know an app that will let me track a few simple exercises like push-ups, squats, pull-ups and that will let me build up a streak?

Additional details:

I'm currently on a 290 day streak on Duolingo, where I'm attempting to learn hungarian because my girlfriend is from there, and I'm encouraging her to in turn learn danish.

That got me thinking, over the years, I've seen a few apps come and go, that tracked different metrics, good habits, reading, creative projects, stuff like that.

I am desperate to get started with at the very basic level, some push-ups. I remember my buddy a few years ago told me how he just used his breaks to do like 50 push-ups at a time, and I remember how his shoulders got noticeably wider and he looked great. I've gotten started so many times, only to stop again after a day, a week or sometimes a month.

I've also started on ADHD medicine, which has gotten me super motivated to get a bunch of things done at home, this in turn has gotten me motivated to try again to find the perfect app, I've tried all the 100 push-ups apps, but they don't seem to do it for me, but gamification does, just like I'm currently chasing the 365 day achievement in Duolingo.

Lastly, thanks for reading, and if there's like some stats to the app that would be swell, it's always bugged me that apple health doesn't let people track push-ups and other such exercises.",8,1583224058,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fcrnk6/app_for_motivationencouragement_discussion/,GetMotivated,1

fcqgut,ALefty,[Discussion] Is there a correlation between Productivity &amp; Happiness? Let's find out! (a Reddit group productivity experiment),"I thought it would be fun to conduct a rather unscientific experiment to finally discover whether or not productivity is correlated to happiness, based on Redditor's responses (that's *you*!)

If you'd like to participate then [join this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z58OUYFUpCG3_yEYirYJYmpcDSI000Cj2HZJuYDKAkk/edit?usp=sharing) and **rate your daily productivity and happiness levels on a scale from 1 to 5 at the end of each day for the next week** (Monday 2/2/20 through Monday 2/9/20.)

If we get enough responses it'll be really cool to see how our happiness and productivity levels relate. We can also learn other interesting things like how productive we are as a community on average (or how happy!)

If you start a day or two late then thats ***ok!*** Just do your best and track what you can :)

# What you need to do:

1. Open the spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z58OUYFUpCG3\_yEYirYJYmpcDSI000Cj2HZJuYDKAkk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z58OUYFUpCG3_yEYirYJYmpcDSI000Cj2HZJuYDKAkk/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Choose a row (respondent number) and write a nickname if it'll help you remember which row you are.
3. Rate how productive you were for the day on a scale from 1 to 5 (5 = very productive and 1 = not at all productive) by click the dropdown arrow.
4. Rate how happy you were for the day on a scale from 1 to 5 (5 = very happy and 1 = not at all happy) by clicking the dropdown arrow.
5. Do this every day up to and including 2/9/20.
6. I'll compile the results and present them to you in a separate post when we're done!

fclgiz,Elias202020,*** Overcoming Depression ***,"Hello everyone,

I just joined the group and wanted to reach out to all of you to talk a little bit about myself. 

It feels great to be in a group where people support each other and share motivational content to keep pushing each other forward. 

In the past, I have battled with depression and over the past years I was always insecure to share this information about me. However, now I am convinced that I can help other people who are going through a similar phase in life by sharing this information.

1. In the moment itself, it is always hard to understand why you in particular have to go through the hardship you face. I realized that you have to accept the negative feelings you have and let them be. Do not try to suppress them! This will only harm you in the long run.
2. Talk and engage with positive people. You have to get a new perspective in life and expand your horizon. You never know how people can impact you in countless positive ways. The worst things you can do is sit at home and feel sorry for yourself.
3. Pursue a hobby. Go after your goals and dreams. You have to keep yourself busy and distracted from the internal conflicts you have. The best way to do that is to work on something that pushes you forward in the direction of your dreams.

I recently started a YouTube channel that focuses on motivational speakers. The reason behind me doing that is to support as many individuals as I can with the content that I provide. 
It would mean the world to me if you could subscribe to my channel and also give me feedback on how I can make it better.

Thank you all, for supporting me on my journey!

fcdh1v,SAPREIGUY,Opportunity / Free Labor [Text]," 

Hi All,

I initially thought about going to fiverr to find a virtual assistant to help me with some of my online work activities a few hours a week. However, I had this idea to post on a few subreddits where I frequently see people asking about how to get started, find a mentor, get work experience, yada yada. 

This subreddit along with a few others is what I owe to getting out of my slump during my college days where I dropped out with a 1.6 GPA and eventually re-enrolled and made A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs all the way to graduation. Back then if someone posted something about helping to get work experience, mentorship, skills, etc. I may have jumped on it. Who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Someone with some free time (3-5 hours per week to start)

Someone that knows a little excel and is interested in increasing their skills

&amp;#x200B;

What you‚Äôll get out of it:

Experience in data analysis, excel, real estate, finance, programming, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If you do a great job, there is a 100% chance I‚Äôd start paying you just to keep you around.

\*\*If it gets boring for you or isn‚Äôt a good use of your time, we can part ways. There are no hard feelings.

This probably isn‚Äôt a good use of my time either, but I thought i‚Äôd see if anyone is interested. Thanks for making me the person I am today!

&amp;#x200B;

Information about me: 

I changed majors every semester for 3 years (Engineering &gt; Politics &gt; History &gt; Engineering &gt; General Studies). After I dropped out with a 1.6 GPA I found Information Systems Management that is a half business and half technology major. I got a certification in SAP and for the past 6 years have been SAP consulting for the biggest fortune 500 companies. On the side I invest in real estate so I can retire early/not have to work a corporate job. My normal job is 50-60 hours per week and I need a few extra hands on the real estate investing side.",0,1583162105,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fcdh1v/opportunity_free_labor_text/,GetMotivated,1

fccvk5,PerfectPlaylist,I spent over a year making a free app to fix the biggest problem with morning playlists.,"Hey guys, like many people I play music as soon as I wake up to motivate me to get out of bed and put me in a good mood for the day. However, sometimes low energy and sad songs play at the end, which really dampens the atmosphere. To fix this I created an app that can sort songs by its energy levels, and how happy the songs are among various other attributes such as dancibility, tempo etc. So, when I create my morning playlists, I use the app to start off with slow songs, getting more energetic and happier at the end.

I have also noticed that because the playlists flow better, I skip or add songs less, which reduces the number of micro decisions I have to make, leading to less stress overall. You can also use the app for running, parties, studying etc.

This is my first app, so feedback would be greatly appreciated. All parts of the app are free and accessible without any limits or premiums.",0,1583159572,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fccvk5/i_spent_over_a_year_making_a_free_app_to_fix_the/,GetMotivated,1

fbwzji,WhosTriggeredNow,[Text] How to get motivated if you have everything you ever wanted?,"I've lived my life a bit too fast, finished university, got a job, saved money, got married, bought a couple condos abroad and then retired at 24 in the philippines.

That was 7 years ago. I've travelled the world and finished my bucket list, that was fun for a couple years, but it got stale after a while. Oh another beautiful city, oh another beautiful beach, having breakfast in another rooftop swimmingpool, couldn't care less. I'm aware that it's a luxury problem, but nothing seems to really appeal to me anymore. It's like been there done that.

Worst part is, there is nobody I can talk to about any of it, I was done with university before most of them even started, then I worked and became an expat when my friends had not yet made any real life experience outside university. When they started working I was already retired. It's like I've lived my life on fast pace and I finished to early and now there is nothing left to do anymore.

I'm really just wasting time away right now, not really knowing what to do anymore. I'm learning my fourth language right now just so it at least feels like I'm progressing somewhere, but if I'm being honest, the last 3 years or so I simply spent floating in my swimming pool watching the clouds pass by or simply sleep the whole day, and then 30 minutes in the evening I learn a couple words and call it a day. It adds up over time of course, but if I was really serious about it I would have been done years ago.

I always get the advice to find a hobby, but the problem is, that is what I've been doing, it gets stale.

After I bought a house with a swimming pool I was swimming every morning, cause hey swimming pool with palm trees, epic right?

After a while it turned into swimming every second day, then every week, then the water was too cold, or I was to tired and at the end I wasn't in my pool for over a year. Then I got a water heater and now I'm just floating around, and it feels like I'm doing it more out of obligation than I want to. Like you have this swimming pool, now fucking use it at least. But you get used to it and it becomes stale.

There is nothing I can look forward to either, if I want to go hike a pilgrim path, I book a flight ticket and go hike for a month, not like I have to work anyway. And then it's done and I have no idea again what to do with my life anymore.

Why don't you go volunteer in africa or something? Been there, done that. The uncomfortable truth is, the biggest help is just donating money, it literally helps the people more to just donate the money for the flight tickets than fly over and try to help.

List goes on, if I found it interesting, I've tried it. After a couple years I ran out of ideas and started wasting away my time drinking all day and watching palm trees move in the wind, and now I've reached a new low, I'm literally on fucking reddit. I could be jetskiing or whatever I want right now, but instead I'm on reddit, just wasting away time.

How to motivate yourself if you have no goals left in life?

Tl,dr: Achieved everything I ever wanted in life and don't know what to do anymore, so now I'm humblebragging on reddit to fill the void.",32,1583082416,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fbwzji/text_how_to_get_motivated_if_you_have_everything/,GetMotivated,1

=&gt;¬†""There are many odds and ends in our life, but the undaunted seeker of reality adopts the path which involves dare and greater experimentation. These qualities enoble an individual and smoothens the sail.‚Äù

=&gt; What does this line mean????


=&gt; This line tries to illustrate a situation which everyone can face. A situation, in which we are greeted with an obstacle and have two paths thereby options, to choose. One of the path is less trodden by people and involves risk( that we think at that point of time) while the other is a well-trodden and the most opted path to follow. We, trying to be on a safer side, opts the path which is commonly opted and start following billions of individuals and are then just a part of the population. While some individuals adobpts the path which requires some extra-ordinary qualities. These type of people make their own unique identity in life.




‚ÄúFOLLOWING SOMEONE‚ÄôS FOOTSTEPS IS COMMON,

BUT MARKING YOUR OWN FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW IS EXCEPTIONAL‚Äù

fbs26z,xXAksManXx,What makes a real man (From the prospective of a young male adult about to leave home.),"What makes a real man? Is a question I‚Äôve always felt I knew the answer to. And is something that has been in the back of my mind these past few weeks. For me a man or a woman for that matter. Is a person who can one make their own choices and take responsibility for each one. Good or bad, or even both. 
Two, a man is someone who no matter what. Never stays down. Physically and mentally. A man can go through a break up and come out stronger. Or mess up an important job and say ‚Äúat least I won‚Äôt do that again.‚Äù There is literally nothing that will keep this person down. Dude is like the terminator. Only his primary mission is to succeed at life. And by doing so, at the end of it all can look back and think. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of what I did. And I‚Äôm glad I never stayed down at all those times I wanted to. 
These are the primary rules I‚Äôve chosen to start living by. Next week I‚Äôm moving out of my parents place and into a new town with new people and a place to live on my own. And believe me its scary. But I‚Äôm also really glad that I‚Äôm about to start my journey into what I think is becoming a man. 
There‚Äôs so many things I don‚Äôt know if I can handle. Like getting use to being alone or maybe finally giving dating a fare go and making new friends. The last thing I want is to be is a boring average person who out side of work and paying bills. Just sits and plays Xbox all day. Because I know for a fact that‚Äôs never going to help my mental health at all. 
I really hope that I find the strength to reveal every new opportunity that presents its self. And while I‚Äôm young leave no stone unturned. I hope that I meet a gorgeous kind girl who loves me. And gets married and makes a family with me. 
I hope that I find it within myself to see the light in each day. And have the ability to reflect that positive energy to those around me to influence there lives for the good as well. 
If anyone reading this has been and lived through the same situation. Please share your story of how it was one of your greatest choices. To make believe even more that there is light at the end of every dark tunnel.

fb8pq9,misterm314,[STORY] Should I take one step forward? No. Take two steps backward.,"I'm brand new to this sub, but I really wanted to share this story with those who are on a similar boat as me. 

I was at the lowest point in my life when I was in my final year of college. When I was younger, I had a dream to become a Professor one day and that I could achieve this through hard work and dedication. I eventually graduated with great grades, I worked a part-time job for several years, participated in club leadership roles, and did research under several Professors; however, these were not enough to get accepted into all of the graduate programs that I had applied to. I thought to myself: ""Well maybe I can apply for jobs in the industry and maybe I can go back to my dream of becoming a Professor."" I applied for many job positions believing that I could find a job flawlessly, but I was wrong. Days went by without hearing from an employer, weeks went on after interviews with employers only to tell me that they had selected another suitable candidate for the position, and months went by where I began to lose hope that I could ever accomplish anything in life. I thought to myself: ""What's the point in trying knowing that I just won't succeed.""

I took a step back from applying for jobs or thinking about my failed attempts at going the Graduate School route. I took a step back about thinking of the future and I decided that I needed to look at myself in the mirror and think for once about where I am in the present. I thought for a while that I needed to reexamine my future, but in reality, I needed to focus on myself in the present. I was deteriorating mentally and physically and a part of me was screaming for help but I was not responding to this desperate plea for help in the past. Rather than moving forward, I went backward and traced my steps to find my inner peace of mind.

For several months, I didn't apply for jobs, I didn't think about my second round of attempts to get into Graduate School. I did the things that I knew would make me happy. I found a new hobby in gardening (something that I never knew I could enjoy), I discovered new TV Shows and movies that I thought I could never enjoy when I was in school, I worked out to improve my physical health, I read several books during my downtime, I baked cookies and pastries for several days, and I found love in my family, who encouraged me to do the things that I love. I did just that for several months and then another failure came upon me.

I got a rejection letter from one of the graduate programs that I had applied to. As I read the letter, I thought that I would feel worse than before, but surprisingly, I felt only the tiniest bit of sadness and mainly hopeful that another opportunity would arise. Patience paid off when my sudden hope arrived the following month.

In just this month alone, I got a job offer from an amazing company with a great culture, hospitable and caring people, and an environment with so many pursuits to learn from. I accepted this offer and I am currently eager to start my job next week. Then, another miracle happened today...

I got an acceptance letter from a Graduate Program, my top choice school as a matter of fact. I was overwhelmed with so much happiness today that I felt like I could run a marathon.

I want to let all of you know that when you are striving to far forward, it's sometimes okay to take a step back, even at your darkest times. After all, how can we learn to read a book without not knowing the alphabet. I've realized that it's okay to take two steps backward after taking a single step forward.

Now I'm stuck in a dilemma between Graduate School and work (because I can't do both unfortunately). However, it's so great to be in a stressful decision with options than no options at all.

Have a great weekend everyone and remember to believe in yourself!",0,1582958519,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fb8pq9/story_should_i_take_one_step_forward_no_take_two/,GetMotivated,1

A new year and I believe the most significant thing in 2020 that everyone should be working on is finding your way, no this is not to say quit your nine to five just yet. But It is to say start investing in you more than others. You wake up to bring someone's dream to light. But this dream isn't yours. It's your bosses, the owners, and everyone above, when do you get to have success, when your next show ends, when your kids grow to adults or right before you wake up from that fleeting dream you wish would come true one day.

Read my last post on [procrastination](https://forwardmotivation.home.blog/2020/01/08/procrastination/), and you'll begin to understand that you will never reach your goals waiting on tomorrow. Accused of being too fast, and impatient, I have lived and accepted that truth, but patience needs balance. Too patient and you procrastinate, and to fast, and you are impulsive. Both will cause delays in your success but not your growth, as I said in my [The challenge of Diet](https://forwardmotivation.home.blog/2019/12/31/the-challenge-of-diet/) post, observation, and contemplation are how we learn.

Day 1 of an old school no-sugars, no-carbs, only healthy fats diet. 6 small healthy meals/snacks day and a lean and green (6oz meat and salad) at night. Not drinking much alcohol at all, so to quit altogether is no big deal. Back to Sashimi, and NO FOOD AT ALL AFTER 8pm.

‚Äã

I‚Äôve been feeling like ass since putting on 40lbs over the last 2 years‚Ä¶Lower back fucked up, can‚Äôt bend straight over to tie my sneakers without breathing hard, feels like I‚Äôm laying face first on a basketball if I try to get a tan on my fat ass‚Ä¶

‚Äã

A high weight of 250 today folks. It will only go down from here.

‚Äã

ANYONE CAN DO IT. Takes will power and the desire to feel healthy overriding the desire to eat food that tastes GREAT. I quit smoking and (backmin the day) blow‚Ä¶cold turkey. Just stopped at will.

‚Äã

If you follow this plan and get your body into ‚Äúfat burning mode‚Äù (takes about 2 weeks of hardcore diet adjustment) WITH NO CHEATING‚Ä¶and the weight will fall off of you like a terminal AIDS patient. üòé üëç

‚Äã

(No offense AIDS patients‚Ä¶.) üò¨

‚Äã

Goal- 210lbs‚Ä¶

fad2n4,lekerfluffles,[Discussion] Advice from a woman on how to casually meet women (or people in general) IRL,"Hey r/GetMotivated! A video was posted on here ""motivating"" people to talk to strangers. Now, wanting to meet new people and talk to strangers is all fine and dandy, but a little self-awareness would be pretty helpful to make everyone feel more comfortable in the situation. I truly think the video was problematic. The woman in the video seemed VERY uncomfortable, including even thinking the guy was going to steal her purse. OP kept laughing it off when people said it was uncomfortable, but really, it's just not okay. Anyway, as an extrovert who could carry on a conversation with a brick wall who also is a woman who has been in many uncomfortable situations and who makes an effort to save other women from these kinds of uncomfortable situations, I wanted to offer some advice of how to more naturally start talking to random strangers without making them crazy uncomfortable. This is going to be long, so bear with me. 

For those that haven't seen it, here's what happens in the video: It begins focused on a random woman sitting alone at a 2-seat table enjoying the sunshine at what looks like a little outdoor cafe. She's playing on her phone, minding her own business, not paying attention to her surroundings. Suddenly, a man walks up and says hello and just sits right down at her table. He then proceeds to tell her about 3 different ways that she's beautiful. She's confused and awkward and laughs uncomfortably and then reaches down to look for her purse to make sure the guy isn't going to steal it. She also continues keeping her phone in her hand for a good while, within her line of sight, continuing to try to mess with it while the guy begins bombarding her with questions. EVENTUALLY, she relaxes a little bit, but her laugh continues sounding uncomfortable. Then the lovely man informs her that he's been recording everything and plans to put it on his YouTube channel. Cue a slight freakout from her and even more awkward laughing. The guy eventually asks if he can get her contact info and she says to add her on Facebook. *Recap complete.*

**What's wrong with this?** Boundaries! Consent! Respect! Or, a major lack thereof. 
The man seems to think he is automatically deserving of her time and sits right down at her table without even asking if he can sit. He doesn't ask if she's meeting anybody, doesn't even ask if she would like to talk. Personally, I would have told him to screw off and get out of my space, but not every woman is comfortable doing that. Many are taught to smile and nod and let the strange man have whatever he wants until he decides he's done. Many women (myself included) have received physical threats for rejecting men. You never know when you're dealing with someone who may turn violent at rejection, so it causes many women to walk on eggshells. 
Then there's the bombarding of compliments right at the beginning. If you don't know what love bombing is, you should look it up. It's NOT a good practice, and more women are starting to understand what it is and that it's typically a pretty big red flag. If you're wanting to just casually meet new people, without any sort of pressure to pursue more, love bombing is NOT the way to do it. 
Now, there's more throughout the video that's uncomfortable and strange, but I don't want to go on forever, so I'll just leave my last point of the paragraph on... ALWAYS ASK CONSENT **BEFORE** RECORDING PEOPLE/CONVERSATIONS! Like, it's 2020, why is this even an issue?! I'd be SO angry if I had an entire 30 minute conversation with a guy and at the end he was like ""oh btw, you're on candid camera and I plan on sharing this with everyone ever!"" AND he also proceeded to ask for her contact info AFTER this. There's added pressure to not look like a bitch when she finds out she's being recorded, so who knows if she really wanted to share her contact info with the guy or not.  *Annnnyway....*

**Now, what you're probably really here for: What can you do to be better?!**
TL;DR: Respect people's boundaries! Make sure they're actually comfortable with what's going on!

**More details:**
Step 1: Read the situation. 
* Is the person super focused on their phone, a book, or do they have their ear buds/headphones on? If so, those are all general signs that the person doesn't want to be bothered. So don't bother them. Simple as that. 
* Does the person look open to their surroundings? Are they interacting with others around them? Are they looking around and seeming interested in what's going on around them? Cool! They are good candidates for potentially wanting to meet new people!

Step 2: Ask if the person wants to talk! You don't even have to blatantly say ""Hey do you want to talk"".... You can be smooth and start out by asking if the seat next to them is open and gauge their response. If they say yes and immediately turn away and seem closed off, they *may* not want to talk. You can then try one more time by making an observation about something around you (Ex: ""Man, this place sure does seem to have a great happy hour!"" ""Did you see the massive amount of birds outside the restaurant?!"" Or something else silly and light) and see if they return with an interesting comment or if they just kind of say ""yeah"" and go back to their own business. Essentially, don't bombard the person immediately and make them feel like they HAVE to talk to you. Give them signals that you're open to talk and let things happen a little more naturally. 

Step 3: Relax and see how it goes! If the conversation dies, that's okay. If something else interesting around y'all happens, try making another comment about it. If that falls flat, just let the conversation die. Also, keep in mind that a conversation dying doesn't mean you've failed. You've achieved something just by going out and putting yourself out there! If the conversation is interesting and continues mostly seamlessly, ask if they want to exchange contact info! 

Other little tips: 
* Leave them wanting more! You don't want to try to learn every little thing about them in this one sitting, nor do you want to tell them every little thing about yourself. 
* Don't just ask them questions. Share a little about yourself and give them opportunities to also ask questions. If you find yourself ONLY asking questions, and if it feels like you're just drilling the person with the questions, it's probably a good sign that the other person wants to be done with the conversation and that you should just let it go.
*You may want to get some plain business cards for cheap on VistaPrint. Handing the person you're talking to a business card as you or they leave is a nice, easy, way to say ""okay, ball is in your court if you want to continue talking, but no pressure"". And you'll want to get yourself some plain ones because you don't want to end up accidentally giving some psychopath information about where you work.
* Do NOT put pressure on yourself to ""try to find *the one*"". Keep in mind that this is strictly going out and meeting people. Who knows what COULD happen, but it's honestly probably going to take quite a few tries before you find someone who is even potentially interested in romance. And putting immediate romantic pressure on the situation will just end up making everyone uncomfortable.
* The more you get out there and try, the easier it gets! Don't give up if the first couple of tries don't work well. Keep trying!

I hope this helps someone. Of course, I'm open to suggestions/recommendations/edits. I just wanted to offer some constructive advice to counteract the terrible advice I saw yesterday.",12,1582814645,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/fad2n4/discussion_advice_from_a_woman_on_how_to_casually/,GetMotivated,1

fack1e,RomanSMironov,[Article] The Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Leaving Comfort Zone in 2020,"Do you dream of leaving comfort zone? Want to understand why you're stuck in average and how to motivate yourself?

Keep reading to learn from¬†Tomas Svitorka and get motivated right now. Tomas is an amazing life coach on a mission to help people leave their comfort zone. And his message is surprising: **it doesn't require hard work at all**.

There is also an audio version of this interview. You can check it out [here](https://romanmironov.com/blog/leaving-comfort-zone/).

## Stuck in average equals unfulfilled

First of all, that's the philosophy of how I live my life. I call it, ""OK is not enough.""

""OK"" is the most dangerous place to be in life. Imagine three levels stuck upon each other.

1. At the **bottom**, it's failure, rut, and pain.

2. ""OK"" is the **middle** level. That's where most people are in life.

3. On the **top** would be success, winning, and fulfillment.

We are all somewhere in these three levels. And most people don't stay at the bottom for too long:

¬∑ It's too painful.

¬∑ It's too uncomfortable.

¬∑ It's too unacceptable.

Imagine that I start twisting your arm:

¬∑ When I just twist a little bit, you can take it.

¬∑ But when I start twisting it a lot, it becomes too painful and you try to get out of it.

That's a metaphor for a situation that becomes too unbearable: a relationship, a job or our finances. Then we will do what needs to be done. We go and get a better job or break up with that abusive partner.

But as soon as people get out of that painful zone, they get into the ""OK"" zone. And there's nothing wrong with ""OK."" It's an equilibrium between efforts and gain. In fact, the primary drive of our brain is to keep us alive. And the way to keep us alive is to be safe, not do anything stupid, not take any risks. Which means never leaving the comfort zone.

*That said, being comfortable is fine but rarely happy and fulfilling.*

## Why are you doing good in life but still feeling unfulfilled?

You might be doing good in different aspects of your life:

1. You have a decent job.

2. You have a wonderful relationship,

3. You are reasonably fit.

But you still might not feel alive, fulfilled, or excited. It's because you're in the comfort zone, the ""OK"" zone. To experience life fully, we need to be better than ""OK."" We need to let go of our comfort.

*By definition, happiness and fulfillment lie outside of our comfort zone.*

## The modern world keeps you in the comfort zone

Most of us live in a world where we have so many opportunities. Life is easier than ever. Most people settle for comfort instead of experiencing the fulfillment and joy of being alive. But we're meant to get the best out of ourselves and be better than ""OK.""

That's when:

¬∑ We contribute.

¬∑ We inspire other people.

¬∑ Other amazing things happen.

Look at Elon Musk and all these incredible things he's doing such as Tesla cars or SolarCity.

1. He's nowhere near his comfort zone.

2. He's working insane hours.

3. He revolutionized the car industry and the batteries that they use and created Space X.

I'm not saying that's the recipe for fulfillment for everyone. What I mean is that *one person can accomplish a lot*. You can disrupt industries that have been going stale because of doing comfortable stuff.

## How do you begin leaving the comfort zone?

Ask yourself:

1. Where does the ""OK"" zone end for me?

2. What would an area of my life need to look like so that I find it fulfilling, satisfying, and joyful?

Say, how much money would I need to be making to start feeling, ""Wow, this is amazing!""? (But by the way, no matter how much money you make, you can get used to anything.) Suppose, if you'd be making $100,000 a year, you might be thinking, ""Oh my God, I would feel like I own the world.""

Now all of a sudden, you have a goal that you can work towards:

1. Why am I not making this money now?

2. How do I need to work on my business to make it?

3. How many clients do I need to have?

4. How much do I need to charge them?

5. What do I need to provide to my clients?

6. What kind of service, how many sessions, what resources?

7. What else do I need to learn?

*As soon as you start digging into that, the path will emerge.*

### Take fitness, for example

My body is okay and I'm pretty fit. But I want my body fat to be 13%. It'll make me feel better. After setting this goal, I asked myself:

1. What do I need to do?

2. How can I do that?

3. Do I know how to do it?

By asking those questions, I realized that I needed to fix my diet and the way I exercised. And here's when an actionable answer came to me:

*Maybe, I need to hire a personal trainer.*

That's exactly what I did. One of my good friends is a personal trainer. I reached out to him and said, ""I need to trim some body fat. Can you help me with that?"" He created an eating plan and a workout plan for me. *The path just emerged.*

## That's how you benefit from having a coach

This is why having a coach is so useful. As a life coach, it's easy for me to help you set up a plan quickly. That's because I've been doing it all day long, every day for many years. But if you never did this, it may be daunting since you don't have that experience. So, I encourage everyone to get a coach because it's transformational.

## Universe metaphor for leaving your comfort zone

In the universe, everything tries to create a state of equilibrium.

For example, planets are around because of gravitational forces that are in equilibrium. That's why stars are around.

Likewise, everything in life tries to find an equilibrium where the forces are equal. This is the ""OK"" zone. This is the equilibrium between how much work we need to put in and how much discomfort we can tolerate.

In life, people want to be as little uncomfortable as possible, with the least amount of effort. That's tolerable discomfort.

*To get things out of equilibrium, one of the forces needs to be stronger.*

It has to overpower the opposing force.

## Create a driving force to pull yourself out of the comfort zone

That said, if you want to change your life, create a driving force. Your desire to change needs to be way stronger than the desire to stay comfortable.

Let's say you want to get fitter. Then your drive to get fit needs to be stronger than resistance to hitting the gym. If you don't create that driving force in your life, you're likely to quit.

Say, you make a New Year's resolution about getting fit. But by the 7th of January or the beginning of February, that resolution is out of the window already.

## Success requires overcoming inconvenience but it's not hard work

I get so worked up when people tell me success is too hard. Yes, it's challenging and time-consuming. *But it's not truly hard work:*

1. It's not like you work in a uranium mine in Siberia.

2. Or not like building pyramids.

3. Or not like being an ultra-marathon runner.

For most people, getting the results they want is just about overcoming inconvenience. Yes, it's unpleasant and not fun. And most people see it as a reason good enough not to be happy in life.

Going back to the equilibrium metaphor:

The gravitational force keeps them in the same comfortable place. They don't want to create a force towards their goals that will overpower the gravitational force.

## Takeaways

1. **The human mind has evolved to keep you stuck in average**. It's fine but rarely fulfilling.

2. **The modern world keeps you in the comfort zone**. But it's your responsibility to demand more of yourself.

3. **Set a goal and ask yourself what you need to do to accomplish it**. As you look for answers, a path will always emerge.

4. **Coaching is transformational.** A coach helps you create a specific action plan and follow it more easily.

5. **Leaving comfort zone requires a powerful driving force**. Create that force in your life to overpower your desire to stay comfortable.

6. **Success is not hard work.** It's just about overcoming inconvenience.

f9zh7h,Bladelazoe,[Text] Little acts of kindness can go a long way.,"So My mother and I went to the gym, finished our workouts then went shopping. We were shopping at Wal-Mart just like any normal day and got in line. 5, 10, 15 minutes pass and we notice that there is a woman struggling to pay for her food. I'm not sure if she had a $40, $45, $50 budget but it went over and both of us could see it on her face. She didn't have enough money and felt noticeably embarrassed. She started taking things out of the bag yet the balance was still higher. Still being over budget, she started taking even more food out(What looked like over half of her groceries) and the look on her face absolutely destroyed us on the inside and we knew we had to do something. So, we ask how much her budget was and how much she had left. We decided to help her out and pay for all of it. She was also having issues with her card and that just added to her stress level. So, as a little act of kindness, we decided to add her all of her items from the grocery cart to our bill.

She was shocked and thankful that we did this for her and as we walked out, we saw her walking out and we gave a hug and whispered ""Thank you...God bless you!"" and we straight up told her that she does not have pay us back or anything. We simply helped her out. Then after that we said ""You have a great day!.""

So, This all started from a feeling, Doesn't matter if it's Excitement, Intimidation, Fear, Uncomfortable. ACT ON IT! You never know what might happen. I encourage everyone to do something like this, if you see someone struggling, offer to help. I just wanted to share this with all of you!

![video](77hufp6uhbj41)

When I very first started my business, the whole goal was to have complete freedom, meaning being able to travel the world without having to work and just making a few thousand dollars per week. But then obviously as you build your business and go through the process year after year, eventually you start wanting to build it even more and grow a bigger and bigger. So your goals get bigger and bigger. And that‚Äôs really what happened to me.

[Click HERE to learn more](https://youtu.be/j5DPpl8G0Rc)

As you go through the process of building your online business, you‚Äôre going to be in the system yourself, creating everything. You‚Äôre not going to automate everything and have people and software do things from the beginning, because first you need to design everything so that it works and be sure that it works so you can move forward to the next stage.

Once you‚Äôve figured out that the system is working, that you‚Äôve built, then you can employ the people and software to do those tasks for you and allow you that next level of automation as you go forward.",0,1582744380,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f9yenv/drop_servicing_passive_income/,GetMotivated,1

f98rim,DevinDC777,Life advice.,"I‚Äôm a 20 year old male, as of right now I have nothing going for me. I don‚Äôt have a job, don‚Äôt have a car, barely socialize with anyone in person. I just stay in my room. I escape reality by playing video games with friends. I suffer from depression/anxiety. This last year has been the worst for me. I‚Äôve been in the hospital multiple times due to anxiety attacks and passing out. Also I‚Äôm neglecting my health, and I‚Äôm constantly getting sick. Poor diet, little to no exercise. I have very little motivation. Some weeks I feel really good, some weeks not so much. I want to do better, but I feel as if I‚Äôm stuck in a bottomless pit. Sometimes I‚Äôll crawl out a little, then I get knocked back down lower than where I started. I planned on joining the military for a whole year, but I know with the way my mental health is that it would be a bad idea. I‚Äôve always had goals of helping people and protecting people, but it‚Äôs hard to find a job within that field. I have a few interests for careers but it‚Äôs not many jobs I could get. I love things related to space/science, archeology, mainly things that could potentially help people in the future. I‚Äôve thought about being a police officer or some type of first responder, but once again my mental health and panic attacks. I feel as if I‚Äôll fold under pressure. I know people say you won‚Äôt know until you try, but I hate hearing that. I get really bad anxiety working a normal 9-5. Could be a warehouse job or anything. I‚Äôm constantly in my head asking if I‚Äôm doing something right, of if I‚Äôm doing something wrong. I overthink everything. I‚Äôm just looking for advice. I know deep down I need help, maybe talking to a therapist or something but I don‚Äôt have the money or insurance. It‚Äôs just hard I know I‚Äôll eventually do better.

f8ls1m,UndeadMarine55,A Lazy Fuck's Guide to Self Improvement: Why Motivation is Dead and Other Memes,"As a self-loathing, chronic procrastinator I've often ridden the self improvement train. You know, the *""I just watched 5 motivational videos of The Rock saying you can do anything you set your mind to, and today I'm going to change my entire life, omg yes""* train. Of course, that effort never quite ends the way we'd envision it; with the new lifestyle lasting all of a week before we're back to old habits.

After the inevitable fall off-the-bandwagon, I'd always do a haphazard post-mortem of why I failed. No matter how short my brief toe-dip into being a better human was, I always seemed to have reasons why I failed... *good* reasons, even. ""*I didn't try hard enough"",* or *""I just wasn't honest with myself*"" or perhaps even better, *""I didn't plan well enough*"". These reasons weren't *wrong*, per se, but they also all seemed to fail to help me do better next time I rode the self improvement train.

Can anyone relate?

Upon reflection, at least for me personally, I think my attempts at self improvement failed for the following reasons:

* I set vague goals with no deadlines instead of **specific** goals with fixed deadlines and measurable outcomes
* I failed to take an **honest** and **complete** inventory of what time and energy is currently being spent on
* I failed to budget time and schedule activities that would accomplish our goals
* I fell into the *""just this once I'll make an exception*"" trap when it's time to execute on the schedule we set

Of these, I think we are usually *really, abnormally good* at identifying the latter two failures. In fact, I think we blame them more than we really should. It's impossible to actually budget time towards achieving goals if we've never taken an honest inventory of what we **currently** spend our time on. It's equally impossible to resist the *""just this once""* trap if we've never mapped out our list of specific goals, deadlines, and outcomes. In short, we blame the wrong things, hence our continual failure.

The last two are context specific, and depend on the first, so I'll only be covering goal setting and taking inventory today.

**Goal Setting:**

Goal setting is actually quite simple, but many people get it wrong. It's easiest if I give an example. Most people will make a goal like this: *""I want to get fit for Summer"".* If they've ridden the self improvement train a few times they might add *""so I need to workout and eat healthy""*. The problem is, this goal is not nearly specific enough, and is meaningless to the reptilian/reactive part of our brains.

Instead, a good goal should look like this:

* High level: Get fit
* Outcome: Weigh 180lbs, measure 32in waist
* Deadline: By 6/01/2020, the time when I've booked my summer vacation
* How: 1 hour of weights per day, before work; 1 hour bike ride 2x/ week
* Reward: Get a tattoo and look good during summer vacation
* Punishment: If I don't do the above, I'll look like shit during the summer vacation I've *already booked on a non-refundable ticket*.

The above is fairly self explanatory, but I'd like to elaborate on one point. It's important to have both a positive and negative motivation here: something really awesome that will happen if I achieve the goal (look good on vacation and get a tattoo) and something really negative that will happen if I don't (look like shit on vacation and I can't back out because I already bought the ticket). We need both reward and punishment in order for goals to really stick, it's just how we are as humans.

Note: While it's entirely arbitrary how many goals like the above you can set and push towards simultaneously, 2-4 longer term goals is probably the ""magic"" number to start with.

**Taking Inventory:**

This is one of the most important steps, because it's where the rubber begins to meet the road. In order to follow through on our goals successfully, we need to know exactly where we stand currently. Taking inventory is a painful, but rewarding process, and it's vitally important to be honest with oneself while doing it. You shouldn't let yourself be too judgy about the way you spend your time, but you need to be as accurate as possible.

Steps to taking honest inventory look like this:

* Once you've formulated your list of goals, make sure you have them handy on a sheet of paper. Write a priority for each (it's ok if some share the same Priority level) as we will need this for later.
* Define ""buckets"" or ""types"" of activities that you engage in on a daily or weekly basis. An example of what a typical set of buckets would be is: Pleasurable Activities / Vices (things we solely do for our own enjoyment, which have no positive effect on our lives but aren't necessarily bad), Career Improvement (things we do to better our careers, could include studying if you're a student), Social Activities (things we do with others, usually not social media), and Self Improvement (things we do to make ourselves stronger, healthier, or happier).
* For each of the buckets, list all the activities you do on a daily or weekly basis along with the amount of time you spend per day/week doing each thing. It's vitally important that you're accurate with this, as you need to truly understand how much of you're time you're spending on each bucket.
* With the above in hand, compare to your list of prioritized goals. Sort your goals by descending priority and your daily activities by total time spent.

Do they match? They probably don't... and that's why your attempts at self improvement have been failing thus far. You are what you spend your time *doing* and your stated goals should at least *somewhat* match what your day to day actually looks like.

f89hm4,My-Fresh-Start,"[TEXT] Motivation is Bullshit‚Äù - David Goggins, so why do you all still refer to him as ‚Äúmotivator‚Äù ?","Genuinely curious. 


It‚Äôs nothing against this sub but as an avid believer in what Goggins preaches and tries to get into our heads, I gotta tell you guys every single one of you on this sub is drastically missing his point. 

‚ÄúMotivation is bullshit‚Äù -David Goggins. 

Goggins makes it clear in his audiobook (I believe) as well as multiple interviews that he isn‚Äôt in the motivation business because he believes motivation is bullshit that comes after listening to a speech and then disappears a few days later. 

David Goggins doesn‚Äôt believe in motivation, that‚Äôs not to say it doesn‚Äôt work but people on here really need to stop with this ‚ÄúGoggins my favourite motivator‚Äù, ‚Äúworld class motivator-David Goggins‚Äù bullshit because Goggins isn‚Äôt about motivating people. 

If you need Goggins to motivate you, you need to wake the fuck up. 

Goggins isn‚Äôt some sort of lazy ass motivation when you feel you need it. 
Goggins is a hard ass motherfucker who believes motivation is bullshit. 

If somehow anyone on this sub read all the way done here and is actually serious about what David Goggins does, check out r/DavidGoggins. It‚Äôs a much better example of what it actually means to understand what David Goggins is saying.

f85ao8,MostLong,[Story] Fat to fit in 6 months.,"I just hit the 45 pound weight loss mark and wanted to share a little of what it's like. I am 43 year old and 6'4 male who has been down the weight loss road before. I had gotten to 190 but had little muscle mass..6 years ago I started bulking but never really tried to cut until 6 months ago. See my GF and I have been more FWB the last 1.5 years. I go to her place 2-3 days a week to ""enjoy our time together"" without getting too serious. When we met I was 230 and she was OK with my weight cause I got muscle but we had an agreement if I gained 10 pounds she would start to look elsewhere...I kinda floated about 230-235 for the next year yet I was doing cardio. Then I started snacking more and more at night while letting my meals just get outa control. 235 when to 245 over night and then 250. Being tall I could hide the weight but my GF started to say I had a dad bod and a cute belly. That was her nice warning I was getting too big. See my GF is 5'10 and fitness model fit/thin. She is stunning to say the least while staying lean for her is a priority in life. It's her way to fit into cute clothes she wants to fit into and look hot at the pool. The day I hit 252 I was done and knew I needed a change. It was do or lose my hot GF. I came up with a plan of 2 800 calorie meals and walk 1 hour a day. Over the next 6 months I dropped 50 pounds and can now see my 6 pack. GF is simply over the moon with my progress and already saying how she is going to fight off the ladies at the pool from ""her man.""

f8598l,electrila,[Story] EMT to Self-Taught Computer Programmer,"# In early December 2019, I was in the midst of a severe bipolar depression episode and lost all purpose in life.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like I was drowning and had no desire to make any changes to improve my situation.  On a whim, I decided to dabble in computer programming to occupy my time.  I immediately realized this was my true calling, my true passion.  From that point on, ***everything changed***.

I have always had an affinity for computers.  I build custom gaming PCs as a side gig and I'm the go-to gal for troubleshooting any hardware/software problems at work.  I never thought I would ever venture into the professional tech industry, but after taking one introductory C++ course, I was hooked.

I began reading extensive online tutorials and coding standards documentation, I subscribed to self-paced coding programs, and I have stayed up until 2 am reading every book I can get my hands on.  I dream about code and think about real-world problems that I may eventually get to tackle.  I have never been more motivated and passionate about something in my life.  It's a wonderful feeling when you finally realize what you're meant to do and where your place is in the world.

As of today, I am on day 5/100 in the #100DaysOfCode challenge.  [You can read more about it here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).  As part of this challenge, I am required to keep a daily log stored in [my dedicated GitHub repository](https://github.com/Electrila/100-days-of-code) and work on personal coding projects for at least one hour a day.  I exceed that by 7 or 8 hours every day.  Although I am only 5 days into the challenge, I want to share the progress I have logged so far, and if this motivates even one person to dive in and try something new that they never thought they would, then this post is 10000% worth it.

Never, ever be afraid to try something new and exciting if you truly want to.  It will be difficult and you will fail many times and want to give up...

# DON'T.  Find what motivates you and keep at it.  Amazing things happen when you least expect them.

f83n6u,soclere,I wrote this for myself to read when I get lazy but want to share it here,"You know what you have to do to get to a place where you can stand to look at yourself in the mirror? You know what it takes? 

It takes everything you have. It takes your willingness to let go, it takes your inevitable self-loathing, and it takes every mistake you ever make to get to where you can be proud of yourself. 

It takes your long nights and empty sobs and endless ours of agony to wash up on the shore of self-acceptance.

It takes the broken, bruised, hollowed out stilts you call bones to take your deepest breath and give your most valiant effort.

It takes ferocity, not drive; it takes starvation, not hunger. It takes every ounce of liquid in your body and then your eyes to keep yourself from destroying the person you can and have every right to be.

This fight, and a fight it is; this fight will take everything from you, everything but your most precious gift. This fight will take everything but your life, and you will respect yourself for that.

You'll fall.

It takes time, time and patience and exhaustion and anything you can give to your present self to become the future you can be.

What will it take for you to be proud of who you are?

What will it take for you to stop hiding yourself from your mirrors?

What will it finally take for you to prove yourself right, that you could do this, that this is who you are, that you do deserve your life?

Find out what it will take and do it. 

You know what it is, you've spent so long imaging yourself doing it; being that person, having that life, living that dream, working that, job and doing those right actions.

What will it take for you to finally do what you've been dreaming about and let yourself stumble but not care, hurt but not stop? What will it take for you to get off your ass and shut out the world that distracts you and shut up the you that listens to the world?

You have yourself, a bottomless pit of potential, sitting and waiting for a pendulum to swing you into action.

You have yourself; what more do you need?

You have all your faults and hurts and angers and in that you have enough to make yourself more than the sum of your parts.

It will take you; it will take you frantically holding on to your sanity. It will take you staying late and putting in extra time. It will take you spending time with yourself, grabbing a homemade quilt and not a bottle of pills. It will take you, sitting alone, staring at your options, and telling yourself no. It will  take you telling yourself ""no"" more times than you can count. It will take you being out of your comfort zone, breaking every boundary you so carefully built. It will take you, wailing in your room because you had to let someone go. It will take you in the kitchen at 4 am making your breakfast because you have a workout before that meeting. It will take your guts, your feelings, your tears, and your triumphs because that is what must be put into life regardless. If your knees never shake you can never say you've lived.

If you haven't given everything you could, you can never say you tried.

So, take one, long look in the mirror. Trace your face, your eyes in the glass.

Ask yourself, as many times as you want,

f812c2,behenyl,Get Swol... but like with dollars," Do you know that humans are great at remembering names but poor at working with numbers? So, the concept of compound interest would be challenging to an average person. Most people find it challenging to deal with their personal finance; they can‚Äôt even account for their monthly expenditures. How do you expect such fellows to understand investments and the value of compound interest? Take yourself as a case study. How much of your income do you spend on frivolities every month? Perhaps you subscribed for services that you do not use consistently? 

Think about the times you decided to give yourself a treat at the restaurant instead of eating home-cooked food. What about the other expenditures at the night club where you spend freely while socializing with friends. Most Americans can conveniently spend above $300 per month on entertainment and services that they do not really need. Does this sound like you? 

Do you know that the money that goes into unwarranted expenses every month can make you a millionaire? You‚Äôll likely make jest of me for proposing such a ridiculous idea. 

How on earth could someone become a millionaire by saving $300 every month? Perhaps you‚Äôve done some math and come out with facts that falsify such a claim. For instance, If you save $300 every month for 50 years, you‚Äôll only end up with $180,000 in your piggy bank at home. With a savings account in a bank, you‚Äôll enjoy a trifling 0.15% interest, which cannot make you a millionaire in a lifetime. 

Are you ready for a shocker? The public has been fed with the wrong idea, which is ‚Äúthe culture of saving money.‚Äù Good luck if you hope to become a millionaire through savings! The money you‚Äôre saving is increasing in number but loses its purchasing power in the long term because of inflation. So, get your heads up, you should be investing your money rather than saving it!

The key to converting $300 of wasteful monthly spending into a million is through **investment and the power of compound interest.** It's no surprise that Albert Einstein described compound interest as the Eighth Wonder of the World. Compound interest works magic with numbers to make seemingly impossible things a reality. The concept is all about reinvesting the profits from investment to earn additional interest! If you don't buy the math, then either keep reading or check out this video for the practical analysis of the [power of compound interest.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52XaKV9AB-Q)

Do you want practical proof? A $300 monthly investment that earns you 12% annual returns is not a high-risk investment. With the power of compound interest, your total balance will be $1,069,759.02 after 30 years. You can Google online compound interest calculator and confirm this fact yourself.

The little money that seems insignificant today can be the key that opens the door of financial freedom for you in the future. I believe you should enjoy your life but avoid wasteful spending. Instead, channel such finances to a low-risk investment and create a foundation for your financial freedom.",0,1582415103,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f812c2/get_swol_but_like_with_dollars/,GetMotivated,1

All it took was a little taste of extra hard hardwork and an impending sense of failure to send me crashing down. So much for all that passion I had.

My negativity is still there, my confidence is still bust and although I've got a sliver of my motivation back, I still fail to drag myself to work more than half the days.

f7rx5k,piratedguy1,A true (yet successful) Pakistani love story - Urdu English mixed,"By: Maira Omair Rana

1995.  
I was 16. He was 17.  
We saw each other for the first time in front of Copper Kettle in Liberty Market Lahore. He was a friend of my cousin‚Äôs and they met briefly while I waited next to the car. He thought I looked like a snob and I thought he seemed too chummy.  
So ‚Äúhmph‚Äù teenage moment!

We met off and on with the cousin but never got along. Snob vs too chummy didn‚Äôt stand a chance!

1997.  
I was 18. He was 19.

I was in my BA 3rd year. He still hadn‚Äôt completed his A levels...moment of silence there.

I took his number from the same cousin and called him one night in June to talk about something pestering me. Something I knew only he could help with. Incidentally he was alone at home and free.

So, as fate would have it, the snob girl and the chummy boy ended up chatting the entire night. Something which is quite a heroic achievement in the times of one landline a house. That too in the TV lounge and Amma Abba‚Äôs surveillance at its peak.

Bharpoor taaliaan!

The next few days we ( separately in our own lives) couldn‚Äôt help but think of how well we got along in that one chat. It was actually as comfortable as chuddy buddies.

So. A few days later I, the cheeti ( as my sister called me later) called him again! From the same landline ( it was an orange phone I still remember that. I still remember his phone number also) and from the same TV lounge. Guess what? Yes! Another all night chat. But drop scene yeh huwa ke meri walida mohtarima aa gayeen subha 5 bajay. She didn‚Äôt exactly figure out what was happening but of course antennas were up. And Mr Rana ki to sitti gum ho gayee (which he told me later). He said he walked outside on the road at 5 am for hours panicking that I may be in trouble.

Later in the day he walked to a PCO to call and check if all is well. The phone kept ringing and shutting until I picked it up. And a voice said ‚ÄúSarah?‚Äù I said ‚Äú uhh no‚Äù He said ‚Äújust wanted to check are you ok?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.

Relief for him.

Giddy smile for me,

And that was it.

Two telephone conversations later we were both 100% certain that we wanted to get married.

Why?

Because it was just so easy to talk to each other. We are the absolute opposites when it comes to personalities, like &amp; dislikes, habits and general approach to things. But, we were both so sure. The kind of bond we had was special, and we couldn‚Äôt let go of it. 23 years later, this one fact still holds true.

Acha jee. Ayen na zara practical zindagi main. Jag jayen thora. 19 sala Hero A levels kar raha hai. Theek hai na? Interest kis cheez main hai? Theatre main. Operation theatre nahin. Drama wala theatre. Theek ho Gaya? Heroine BA kar rahee hai. 3 sisters and an EXTREMELY strict and conservative household. Fauji abba. Elder sister engaged. Matlab ke next in line to get married and Amma Abba completely clear on the fact that 1 acha rishta and baat done and beti ko tata bye bye. Parhayee etc sab 2nd priority.

Kher. Nazreen waqt ka pahiyya chalta raha. BA ho gaya. Lekin hero A levels main fail ho gaya. Bijlian gir gayeen armaanon par. His result came out the day my best friend was getting married. Crying my eyes out was easy because it got camouflaged behind my missing her. Everyone thought she was so lucky to have me as her best friend  
My Masters degree began and he enrolled in a local foundation course for an external degree.

My elder sister got married matlab tamaam topon ka rukh kahani ki heroine ki taraf. Rishtay atay rahay lekin waapis bhee bhee rahay, Shukar Alhamdullillah! Never did rejection feel so good!

1999.

He told his mother kyunke bairooni maddad ki zaroorat par chukki thee. Aik rishta serious ho gaya tha. Army Captain. I wonder where he is now...ok. Focus. His mother was super supportive. I collected the himmat to confide in my mother. Jhaar pari lekin qayamat nahin ayee. Baree hee maharat se donon walidas to milwaya. Makhan lagaya. Kiya nahin Kiya. They both said ok we will help you. Plan yeh tha ke my Ami will defer potential rishtas and his mother will bring the rishta as soon as he nears graduation and can talk to Abu with some grace.

Took a promise from us that we strictly follow boundaries.

No exclusive meetings.

No one should be able to see us together.

No compromise on this.

And we remained true to our word.

Now when I think of it I feel SO good about us.  
I kept studying. He tried studying and kept doing theatre. Started debate coaching with the initial pay of Rs. 5000.

2000.

My Masters done. Itni parhi likhi qabil heroine. Hero ka final year. Finally!!! Rishta aa gaya and came the million dollar question ‚Äúyeh larka Akhir karta kiya hai?!‚Äù Start of a new era of daily discussions and many at times fights of Abu saying this is insane and Ami supporting me ( how sweet).

2001.

Finally a graduate. Hero found a job of 13000 Rs. Wasn‚Äôt great but I was ready to marry an unemployed man to Yeh to lottery thee. I started working. With almost the same pay...and Somehow, after two years of convincing and case pleading we got engaged on the 1st of January 2002. By far that day is, even now, the happiest day of my life. If anyone asks me that question, the first image that pops in my head is that night. It was surreal...honestly it was just meant to be. There was nothing going in our favour but somehow it happened.

Understanding yeh huwee the shadi araaam Se ho gee. Obviously hero was 23 years old!!! But dekhain, dulhan 22 kee thee na...and that‚Äôs OLD in a conservative, Punjabi family. To naya katta khul gaya na. My parents wanted it over and done with ASAP and his parents were reluctant. I can understand both sides but qeema kis ka bun raha tha? Aik saal main tension peak par pohanch gayee aur wohee huwa jo filmi stories main hota hai. Hero ko laga unn ke Amma Abba ki ‚Äúinsult‚Äù ho rahee hai and unhon ne mangni tor dee... jee haan!!!  
ü•Åü•Åü•Å

Lekin heroine ki dhittayee par to medal banta hai. ( My sister suggested that I should talk to Abu. Matlab ke khud kush Hamla). Aadhi raat ko ja kar Abba ko jagaya aur bhaaan bhaaan kar ke dukhi kahani sunayee. Felix felicious feeling thee seriously. He heard me. And somehow promised to take care of everything. And he did. Date set ho gayee. Aglay saal ki! 365 days later. That one year was torturous. Because both set of parents were extremely upset with each other and both of us were constantly playing peace makers with one goal. Countdown to 365 days...it was exhausting!

But main ne bhoolne nahin diya hero ko ke mangni main ne jori. Jee Haan. Pehli call bhee main ne hee kee thee. I‚Äôm sure he mutters under his breath ‚Äúwhy did you?‚Äù.  
Acha jee six months before the big day, Mr Rana decided to quit his job and pursue acting. Chalo jee. Naya sayapa. To huwa Kiya? Everyone discouraged him. Except me. But he wanted to satisfy his parents and went to UAE for a job hunt. Nope. No luck. Came back and announced that whatever it takes I am going to pursue my first love. Theatre and acting. And there was no turning back. Nautankee it was!Amma Abba told me clearly ke soch lo. There is no certainty or future for theatre or acting in Pakistan. All my life I‚Äôve been answering the wretched question ‚ÄúSo what does he ACTUALLY do?‚Äù Lekin kahan jee. Nothing hits home when you‚Äôre in ‚Äúlurvvve‚Äù. He assured me that he will make me the happiest girl on earth. I believed him.

2003.

To kar li shaadi.

We were the happiest people alive. I honestly have seen VERY few couples as happy on their wedding day as we were. We were actually on cloud 9. Ready to take on anything that life brings. Anything.

Early marriage days were an absolute dream come true. We felt that all hardships are behind us and we have conquered everything in life. If we can do this, whatever life brings will be easy! Life with him for me actually meant a fairy tale. I was the stupid, naive, day dreaming princess and he was my Prince Charming, equally young and naive. He was supposed to whisk me away from a life of curfews, restrictions and boundaries to a house where I could paint the town red! From the house that didn‚Äôt allow me to laugh loudly and clap without a reason to a house where dancing to random songs was daily routine. Without any occasion or reason.

The fact that we paid for a 2 day stay at PC Bhurban with our salamis was a matter of pride for us. We still talk about how we sat down on day 3 and counted if we can stay another night, which we couldn‚Äôt and came back.

Happily.

The first few months were like a daze. With no luxuries but plain joy. We had so much fun. Just being together. Nothing mattered. Driving to work in the morning chatting chirpily, watching TV with dinner, going for groceries. Finding joy in the smallest of moments. Will our car ( a 3rd hand Alto) start or not in the morning was a daily bet of ours. The fact that our entire pay ( both) was spent completely on basic necessities was a matter of pride for us. Watching late night movies with a pizza was an absolute luxury!

I was willing to face anything with him. For him. When our car‚Äôs windshield smashed during a toofan we didn‚Äôt have extra cash. Omair won 10000 Rs at a theatre festival the very next week and we got it repaired. Drove around for days with no windshield and we still laugh about it üôÇ

But things started going downhill a few months later. My super comfortable relationship with my mother in law turned bitterly toxic, for reasons incomprehensible to me ( at least then).

My 29 year old elder sister suffered a brain hemorrhage in UK and was in the hospital for months. In and out of surgeries before coming around but her movement was affected for life.

My parents and younger sister went on rotation to be with her while I stayed back because I was ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äôs wife‚Äù now so he was supposed to take decisions for me. Finances became a big issue so I took tuitions to save money and go visit her.

Omair found a better job and kept doing some TV work on the side but it was a struggle with nothing to fall back on. My heart would be with my sister but I would act jolly because ‚Äúghar ka mahaul kharab hota hai‚Äù. He decided to study and applied to LUMS for an MBA and started preparing for GMAT, which meant greater financial stress one me. But I stood by him. He didn‚Äôt get in ( a behteri in hind sight). The constant stress affected my gynea system... I actually didn‚Äôt feel like having a child because I was just so unhappy...and the uncertainty of life, my sister‚Äôs health, my parent‚Äôs stress and his career had started getting to me. But it had been three ‚ÄúLONG‚Äù years, and that gullible version of me caved in to pressure and we started treatment. What followed was two years of scans and injections and tablets and all the side effects that come with it.

2007.  
Eventually, an IUI worked and Rayaan came along. In bitter reality Rayaan was my clean chit in the eyes of the society that I am ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù. I did not feel any gushing love for him. Omair on the other hand was over the moon! He has not loved anyone like he‚Äôs loved Rayaan. He is born to be a father. And that was a blessing, because Rayaan got the love he deserved from Baba while Amma was busy fighting her battles. The toxic relationship with my mother in law turned unbearable, I almost had a nervous breakdown and we moved out. It was ugly.

Omair didn‚Äôt have a job at this time. We had an infant and no worldly possessions at all except my jewellery and bedroom furniture. Fun fact: I had no jahez. Omair‚Äôs family made is 100% clear that there will be no jahez. Full marks to them there.

In these 4 years the ONLY thing that kept me sane was Omair, his humour, and our friendship. In these years we became even closer friends than before. He would listen to me silently if ever I felt like venting my heart out. Mostly I tried to keep it in because I didn‚Äôt want to upset him. Just silent hand holding was so comforting when he didn‚Äôt have any words of tassalli for me. He didn‚Äôt share his stress because HE didn‚Äôt want to stress me out.(This is when I realized strongly how the man is the worst hit in a conflict between his wife and mother. Made a mental note of never ever letting my son go through this. I hope I remember this by the time that time comes)).  
We cared for each other as friends before anything else and kept going...We have always been more of friends than anything else.

Something that caused huge problems later because married people need to be husband and wife, behave like a couple, argue like a couple and demand stuff like a couple. But we thought as long as we can communicate openly, make each other laugh, never dream of hurting the other and never go to bed angry, all is well.

This man has made me laugh at the toughest of times and has always ALWAYS been kind. That alone is something I cannot thank Allah enough for.

2008.

This marked the year for us actually starting from scratch. I sold some of my jewellery to buy furniture (Something I confided in Omair much later and he still hates this fact) crockery and appliances. We used up all of our savings. We set up a two room portion far away from the city which we called home for two years. I remember someone bringing flowers which I put in a balti because there was no vase. Meals were on the floor. We used to leave home at 645 daily to drop Rayaan to day care ( eternally grateful to The Early Years ) and get to our jobs. I was teaching at several places and so was he. We were shuttling between jobs all day. Only to return in the evening exhausted, showered ( if we had the energy), have omelette toast and crash. All this was just making ends meet, pay rent, bills, Rayaan‚Äôs fee, basic grocery and NO savings. Eating out was out of the question. But we were SO very happy.

It was unbelievable.

Even now when we look back the two years at ‚Äú26 M‚Äù were the warmest, coziest, happiest ever. I actually found out what people mean when they say money isn‚Äôt everything. I learnt to love my baby boy who was an absolute Godsend. He took his first steps on that terrace. We got heat strokes from the hot weather but still managed to smile. The first sofa set we bought was second hand, for Rs 4000, which Omair refused to give away till 3 years ago.

The beds in the 2nd room were given by a dear friend for free. We shared the bills. Since we couldn‚Äôt eat out much I experimented with a lot of cooking (Dalda ka dastarkhwan was my saheli in those days).

Sharing financial and household responsibilities was never ever a problem between us. It was always ‚Äúour‚Äù money, our responsibilities. We were both fighting our separate battles of the move ( we really never wanted to move away from his parents and this was very painful for both of us differently) but we never fought over it. Everything was always so civil and so comfortable.

2010.

We moved to a better place. Things settled a bit vis a vis work. Him and mine both. Slowly the ice started melting with my in laws ( things now are 100% ok. Yeah. That also happens. A lot of the credit goes to my parents in law here. But that‚Äôs a separate post)  
Slowly and steadily we made a home.

Right now, I‚Äôm sitting in our TV lounge of the home we‚Äôve been in since 2010. And when I look around, every single thing that I can see has been bought by us personally.

Alhamdullillah.

Allah has been so unbelievably kind. If I say that we have actually built a home from scratch together, it‚Äôll be 100% true. From a teaspoon to the TV to the car. Everything. But we still remember the first 5000 he earned and the third hand Red Alto whose floor collapsed while we were driving it. Flintstones!!!!

2011.  
I had my miscarriage.

2012.

This was the year we lost our twins in the 33rd week.

What followed was a complete fallout between us.

Oddly enough...We were heartbroken, more for each other than our own selves. I struggled desperately to deal with everything that follows after losing a child. But I failed miserably because of my combination of ‚ÄúI have to be strong‚Äù, ‚Äú I should always be grateful‚Äù, and ‚Äú everything happens for a reason‚Äù and ‚ÄúI need to be there for him‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLook how much pain my sister has gone through, this is nothing‚Äù.. But my body wasn‚Äôt agreeing with my mind and I fell critically ill.

Hospitalized for weeks while doctors struggled to figure out the problem. Eventually managed to come out of it Alhamdullillah but it took its toll on our relationship.

We drifted apart although he looked after me with such care that it makes my heart melt every time I think about it. But we both knew that it wasn‚Äôt the same.

For reasons we both knew and understood but didn‚Äôt have the courage to talk about. Since we were such close friends, we both understood the other‚Äôs thinking process and we let each other be. It was like parallel lives. We came home to each other, never stopped loving each other but we started living our own lives. Professionally we both grew but as ‚Äúus‚Äù we stopped moving.

Now, when I see couples making this mistake I make it a point to tell them. Ask them to talk it out. Understanding each other‚Äôs struggles and giving each other too much space at the cost of your own happiness can cause irreversible damage.

This lack of communication is something I regret in hindsight. Something that went on for years and something that caused our marriage to almost end at one point...We didn‚Äôt even talk about what we were going through with anyone either.

No One.

Because our go to person was us...to kiya kartay?

But, yet again, guess what came to our rescue? Dosti. We just couldn‚Äôt give up on the dosti. No matter how much time we spent with other people, we just couldn‚Äôt help but miss what we have.

And what we have is extraordinary.

We feel at home with each other.

And that is irreplaceable.

You know the person who can look at you and understand what you are about to say? That‚Äôs us.

Home is where your heart is, and our hearts belong to each other. Three C sections and he stayed with me at the hospital. You want your mother around at that time and I wanted him. He‚Äôs changed countless pampers, done night duties with the kids, cooked breakfast for me, cleaned, dusted, changed linen, gotten furniture poshish done, taken me shopping infinite times, waited patiently while I got my threading done only so we can take a drive together, bought sanitary napkins, taken me for Falooda at midnight, you name it. He made me open my first personal bank account and asked me to put all my salary in it instead of the joint account, he‚Äôs never asked me how much I earn, never told me I‚Äôm fat ( and I‚Äôve been fat!!!). Always disregarded comments about how ‚Äúyoung‚Äù he looks compared to me.  
Something I have let bother me for years before growing up and not giving a rat‚Äôs ass eventually.

We‚Äôve never ever argued in front of the kids. He‚Äôs always given me the lead in parenting, trusting every single decision I take as a mother, and never made me feel bad for the bad ones (there are quite a few).

He‚Äôs never stopped talking to me although I tend to give him the ‚Äúsilent treatment‚Äù quite a few times. He‚Äôs supported me most in my work. Helped me through the tightest spots professionally. I have grown as a person with him. I have learnt from him what it means to truly forgive someone, to be non judgmental, to drop one‚Äôs agenda and focus on the bigger picture. People say it about their fathers, and as much as I love my Abu with all my heart, my husband gave me wings to fly and the  
courage to follow my dreams.

He‚Äôs actually one of a kind.

Completely secure.

Non judgmental.

Hospitable and generous to the core.

Genuinely happy for everyone‚Äôs success and happiness.

Humble.

A truly happy person who wakes up every morning to live life to its fullest!

A truly loving father.

A genuinely caring son.

An absolutely accommodating husband.

A wholeheartedly loving brother.

A friend in need.

I‚Äôve spent years being scared of Nazar and bad luck by telling people how blessed I feel, every moment of my life, but not right now. I feel if many people will jinx this, enough people will be happy for us and make the bad nazar nuetral üôÇ I think the world deserves to know this side of the coin as well.

There ARE men who are plain GOOD men. And I have been infinitely lucky to have one of them. I may become overwhelmed with fear in a few days though. I‚Äôm unpredictable in this department  
üßø

My love story is rather simple.

I simply decided to marry my best friend. My best friend decided to marry his. And we really wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. He calls me his ‚Äúbest mistake‚Äù. I still can‚Äôt decide if that‚Äôs a compliment or not I  
consider him ‚Äúmy lucky break‚Äù in life.

We haven‚Äôt had a marriage which revolves around expensive presents, holiday destinations or lavish surprise birthday parties but we have a marriage which has survived the test of time. It is based on years of honesty, trust, hard work and respect. We have both invested in it. Yes I have invested a lifetime in this relationship as well. I have compromised and given in countless times. Cried myself to sleep and wept in the shower. There have been numerous ugly downs in these 23 years...but the beautiful ups have been more than numerous. The laughters are actually infinite.

Alhamdullillah.

The most important thing is that we haven‚Äôt kept any scores. Who needs to keep a score when we both get to win in the end?",0,1582374472,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f7rx5k/a_true_yet_successful_pakistani_love_story_urdu/,GetMotivated,1

f7aaz8,jesspennington_,Stop worrying about what the scale says!,"Sooo I have been on a weight loss journey for as long as I can remember. For such a long time I would workout, weigh in and wonder why the scale wasn‚Äôt going down. After a few weeks I‚Äôd lose motivation and the cycle would begin again. Well, recently my partner and I decided to start our journey again, but for real this time - going all out! To make sure we held ourselves accountable we started a YouTube channel. Honestly, putting ourselves out there has really kept us on track so the channel itself has been a big motivator. 
Anyways, the first few weeks my weight wasn‚Äôt really changing but I was really sticking to my workouts and eating so we decided to measure ourselves too. So far, my weight has gone up but I‚Äôve dropped almost 5 inches off my waist! Along with that I‚Äôve started focusing more on how I feel too, my energy levels have gone way up. If you are on a weight loss journey too, don‚Äôt get discouraged when the numbers don‚Äôt say what you want then too - focus on how you feel too and keep going! The biggest thing that‚Äôs helped me this time is being consistent. 
My partner is doing really well too, he‚Äôs struggled with his weight most of his life but he‚Äôs super dedicated this time. I think having someone to do it with you helps a lot too. 
If you want to check out our journey our channel link is here;

I‚Äôve just reduced my work hours to 4 mornings a week with Friday off entirely.  This week I decided that I‚Äôd start doing some of the jobs I‚Äôve been putting off for what feels like forever. 

I‚Äôve taken down my curtains, finally gotten around to cutting them in half, think we hung them like 4 or 5 years ago as just one huge panel of material, washed all the windows in my living area, cleaned off the breakfast bar, folded my table down, cleaned up the kitchen and generally gotten rid of all the clutter. 

The whole space looks amazing!  And instead of doing it in silence, I put on a Spotify playlist of rock music from the 80s and revisited some of my all time favourite music at top volume of course. 

Now I‚Äôve earned several hours on the couch with either Netflix (the Witcher), my switch (hmm the Witcher, or octopath traveller?) or reddit. Ah decisions decisions!

f6uckx,nathanknaack,You must gather your party before venturing forth...,"For a bit of context, this classic line is from an old series of computer role-playing games called *Baldur's Gate*. When you try to leave an area without your group nearby, the narrator says, ""You must gather your party before venturing forth."" Your party consists of you and the cast of colorful, capable, diverse non-player characters you've recruited during your adventures: warriors, wizards, archers, etc.

At points in your life, you'll come across people who are better than you at stuff. Stronger, faster, smarter, more accomplished, more connected, better looking, whatever. It can be daunting if you think of life as Facebook or Instagram, where these are your competitors. How do you keep up with a world where everyone is better than you at different thing? How do you get on with your life knowing there are people out there who make more money, have more friends, and have happy home lives?

You must gather your party before venturing forth.

They're not competitors or rivals - they're potential party members. Friends, allies, relationships, co-workers, confidants, mentors. Someone is better than you at something? Make friends and learn from them! Someone is more popular? Make friends! Someone is way better than you at sports? Make friends and learn from them!

Life is hard and sometimes it feels like you're playing it on hard mode. I get it. But there's no rule against teaming up. Nobody said you have to solo this adventure. Team up! Gather your party!

f6q904,ZomboFc,What've you got to lose?,"What've you got to lose ? nothing. you came into this world with nothing and you will leave the same. make friends. look up. and listen to music. Solve problems for people in need. 



Apart from that, take the time to learn who you are. 


**you will die alone.**


**but this experience we call life is special.** 

its hard, there's no book to tell you what your life is supposed to be.

Don't dedicate your happiness to other people. most people are as stupid as you and when you try and get close they get scared. 

live your life for yourself. disregard trying to find people.

its really hard to explain, but the less you look for something the more it finds you.

it wont be a relationship but it will be people you can meet and grow with. 

they wont be perfect relationships.

I have realized that people get into relationships to not be alone. even abusive relationships to not have to sit inside of their living space with their own thoughts.


Do not ever sell yourself short to an abusive relationship because you don't want to feel alone.

You are important, and what you do with your life is your life. 

We are here with no rules and our own ideas of what we want in life. 

If you aren't hurting anyone don't let anyone stop you.

this life is for you.

do not let anyone tell you otherwise.

listen to your favorite music, go take a walk and listen to yourself. 


this life is about you and what goodness you leave behind.

but at first take a second.

take a deep breath and remember

none of us know whats going on and some of us who do are continually trying to manipulate one another instead of extending a helping hand.

watch out for the snakes. 

but must of us just want to smile and laugh cause we are too bogged down by the depression of what it means to be alive. 

i am sorry for ranting but please, your life is yours, yes there is sadness and death and a lot of other terrible things. but you cannot control that most of the time. 

live life and smile. 

we only have a short amount of time so please

just cry and smile sometimes please

also please dont message me if im alright go do something else",0,1582188203,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f6q904/whatve_you_got_to_lose/,GetMotivated,1

f6lt4k,Muffstic,"How I fixed my digestive issues IBS, Chron's, IBD, Celiac, UCD. [Discussion]","I chose to do the (SCD) specific carbohydrate diet to try and fix my digestive issues. It's tough for the first 2-3 weeks because of the low carb flu, but I can almost guarantee you'll feel sooo much better. I was nauseous, bloated, had diarrhea, and constant abdominal pain.

Tried many doctors and different medications, including doctors recommendations to stay away from fried, fatty, and  foods with gluten. I would get these random shooting pains throughout my body that only lasted for a few seconds, but they were very painful.

When I first got out of bed my ankles and knees hurt and I limped for the first couple of minutes. I had De Quervain's tenosynovitis which I was told I needed surgery to get rid of. My hands would hurt from an old carpel tunnel issue from several years ago.

I started googling how to fix my IBS since the medications and doctors didn't help much in the later years. I came across several diets that supposedly helped but I didn't know where to start. I messaged people on some Yahoo group that I found and asked for recommendations.

Several people said any of the low carb diets would most likely help and I should just pick one. I chose the SCD diet and bought the book called BREAKING THE VICIOUS CYCLE.(This book was when by a doctor trying to find a cure for her daughter's Celiac disease.) I recommend reading this book no matter what diet you choose, it helps open your eyes to some of the reasons for your problems. Google SCD legal and you'll find the Breaking The Vicious Cycle website for more information.

The diet starts with only eating homemade chicken soup for 1-5 days depending on the severity of your symptoms. Then phase 1 you can only eat meat, fish, eggs and 1 well cooked vegetable. The way this diet is setup is to start with the foods that should be tolerable to most people, then slowly introduce foods to ensure they don't bother you.

The first 1-3 weeks I felt awful because all of the bad bacteria that was feeding off of the carbs were dying and making me sick. Once this flu wore off I started to feel much better. All my pains went away except the pain and swelling from the De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Then my brain fog went away; I stopped forgetting where I put things, I no longer had trouble remembering things, answers popped into my head almost instantly.

I felt like I was forcing myself to eat but was generally getting less than 2000 calories per day. I started to lose weight and feel even better. I started to sleep better and was no longer grumpy in the mornings. I stopped falling sleep on the couch after work. Since I wasn't exhausted all the time, I stopped getting angry for every little thing.

My diarrhea started to be less in the number of times per day and my stool started to form. My abdominal pain was getting less frequent/intense. My nausea was getting less as well as the bloating.

After several more weeks the abdominal pain was gone and my De Quervain's tenosynovitis was gone. By this time I lost 25-30 pounds and several inches on my waistline. I was now going to the bathroom regularly once per day for the first time in my life.

Sadly, in recent months, I've been eating horribly on and off. I put all the weight back on and the diarrhea is back just not as bad. Some of my pains are back but not as bad, the nausea and bloating is far less than before. My stomach rarely hurts but I haven't completely gone off of the diet.

Most of current meals are still part of the diet, I've just ate out some and ate horrible things such as cookies, bread, and crackers. I am currently working on getting back on the diet so I can feel better, sleep better, and get my memory back.

**It's important to understand that the SCD isn't a low carb diet; you are allowed to eat unlimited carbs as long as they're on the legal list. That being said, I believe there are similarities between this diet and low carb diets. **

If posting links isn't allowed, sorry in advance. If you can't view the files let me know and I'll try again.

TL:DR I tried the SCD diet after suffering from IBS for as long as I can remember. I felt 1000% better but have fallen off the wagon.

f6f8jl,mancub617,"[Story] You may not see your gains, but other people do.","Not *entirely* sure that this belongs here, but I wanted to share an experience that happened yesterday that might motivate you all to keep grinding.

Some context:

About two years ago, I had a really bad breakup. My first love kinda deal. After it happened, I wallowed for a bit, but then I got myself on a self improvement journey. One particular piece of this journey was the gym, it was easy enough to add into my schedule. I started off slow and felt weak and embarrassed to only be able to lift 15 pounds and whatnot, but I kept with it.

It wasn't until last august (2019) that I really decided to buckle down on the gym, and I've gone pretty consistently since then. The whole time though, I felt like I really wasn't any stronger than the week before. It wasn't a crushing thought, but I started to wonder if I even was getting anything out of it. 

The actual experience:

Yesterday, I was at the gym late at night, and I happened to reconnect with some buddies I knew in high school. They approached me and vibrantly told me how **BIG** I had gotten since high school. I was a pretty weak/chubby kid in high school, and I could tell that I trimmed down a bit. But I was totally caught off guard by the fact they had thought I had gotten stronger, bigger, more muscular, etc.

We didn't chat very long, and we did some minor catching up. But honestly that small interaction has re-energized me. So I write this to simply say: You may not notice a difference, but if you keep at it, someone will notice it for you. 

Keep Grinding, whatever it is you're working on &lt;3.",10,1582137937,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f6f8jl/story_you_may_not_see_your_gains_but_other_people/,GetMotivated,1

f669q8,kietsbakingpalace,Student starting clothing brand,"HI everyone, I am a 16 year old student and I just started my own clothing brand. Normally I hate self-promotion but I would love if you can all follow my Instagram page so it can grow more and I can reach more people with my clothing brand. Especially due to the fact that I want a more hidden meaning behind my brand, I have lived for 13 years in my home country, the Netherlands. When I lived there I had many friends who had problems in their family involving drug abuse. It hurt me a lot to see that happen to my friends because I never had those problems myself. I moved to Singapore when I was almost 14 and I realised how unfair this world can be sometimes. So many children have all the opportunities my friends back home never had. Especially due to the fact that many students here have a financial support from their parents. I always wanted to change the world and I still do so and with my brand I want people to realise how unfair life can be depending in what family you are born. I was wondering if you guys can give me some advice on how to start a clothing business and how to make it successful and grow big. My instagram page is @ pro purra. 

Thanks you guys",0,1582091489,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f669q8/student_starting_clothing_brand/,GetMotivated,1

But I started my own clothing company and I want the brand to really blow up, logically of course lol. And I want my profit to use to give back to my neighbourhood in Amsterdam and help with family issues involving drugs since that is something that happened a lot in my community. I was wondering if anyone here on Reddit has any tips for how to grow a clothing company to a real business. And also if you can all follow the instagram page @ luckyhouseclothing. I decided to name it ""Lucky House"" since I am so lucky to be born in the house and family that I am born in as opposed to some of my friends who had to struggle a lot with their families and drug abuse. I don't want to sound like some cringe kid but I just wish some of you guys can help me.

f5ouqc,Jemtex,[Discussion] Motivation genetic component? MQ (Motivational Quotient),"MQ Motivational Quotient.

There is evidence that IQ has a large genetic component.

Are there any studies eg double-blind randomised on motivation and genetics eg twin studies.

If motivation is largely genetically determined does become a kind of negative and unrealistic to say

Just try harder, just make a decision to study harder, train harder or whatever.

I think there are studies that show, Ritalin and similar improve concentration ability.

Also, there is ADHD

This suggested a chemical/receptor mix that might in some people make them naturally better and concentration and working hard for long periods with extreme focus.",0,1582015671,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f5ouqc/discussion_motivation_genetic_component_mq/,GetMotivated,1

f5obrk,krunk06,I tried intermittent fasting for 10 days and lost almost 3kgs of weight.,"I'm Kunal, Age (24), Height (5'6"") and I've gained a tremendous amount of weight last year. I used to be athletic built and had around 61kgs of bodyweight (around 14-16% of body fat). But after almost an year without training and proper diet, I gained more than 15 kgs of weight which I think is all fat in my opinion. I started to feel very depressing and shameful for what I did to my body. I have always been so conscious about my health but I know my eating habits have cost me so much. I really want to transform myself the way I used to look and feel. So I decided to step up and start all over again with a goal to lose a good amount of weight.

So on 4th of feb, I was doing some research about how to loose weight more efficiently and effectively in a very short period of time. And I came across this fasting regime and when I saw the video I thought it's bullshit (it's not though) but then I googled it and read about so many transformations that people went through which really influenced me to do it as well. So I decided to do it myself. 

On 6th of feb, it was my first day of intermittent fasting. I scheduled my eating cycles to be only 2 meals per day with a eating window of 6 hours. I know it's very difficult and I really had so much difficulty for the first 2-3 days. But as the days went, I became kind of habitual with the process. I used to have breakfast before but now I don't eat anything untill it's 3PM. I only have black coffee in the morning which has almost no calories at all. I have scheduled my first meal which consists of around 800 calories (Good amount of protein, healthy fats and carbs all together) and then I eat the second meal at around 8:30-9:00 PM at night which also consist of around 600-700 calories. I'm a vegetarian so most of my meals consist of vegetables, wheat, rice, oats and dairy products. I was also doing some home workouts during the process which also helped me to burn some extra calories.

Finally on 16th of feb, I checked my weight and I was really happy to see the difference on the scale. Previously it was 76.2kgs and after following the fasting routine I'm 73.4kgs.
I'm really happy with my little progress as I'm looking forward to continue it till I hit my target which is to be around 62-63kgs again.

The reason I am sharing my experience of weight loss is because there are some people who find it difficult to lose weight and struggling with bad food habits just like me. But if you make small (daily, weekly) goals, I'm sure you'll be able to loose good amount of weight and feel nice. There are however so many other advantages of fasting which will also improve the mental health of an individual. 

I hope my experience have helped you in some way or the other. And if not then sorry to waste your time. Be happy and be healthy :) Peace..",0,1582012310,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f5obrk/i_tried_intermittent_fasting_for_10_days_and_lost/,GetMotivated,1
f5o3ll,ElEscultorDeAnsiedad,She saves my life I don't remember how,"Hi i (22) am a ""not posting person"" because I have a extreme anxiety transtorn but today I almost lost every single hope if she (18) does not be the most extraordinary girl I ever met, I am sorry about my English, it is not my language at all so hope your eyer do not explode trying to read this, well... I have anxiety since my childhood but my family had a lot of loses and I had to be strong since I was a little boy, nobody ever understand me because my weird form I expressed my feelings and I can not speak well. All my life was a little hard for me and every day it's a war between my self-esteem and my ability and aptitudes to deal with it, ten months ago I had a really painful panic attack and that made me unable to keep working so my sister invites me to a couching training (actually it was a kind of religion if you see the things in a smart way) that thing was beautiful the first week and there I met her, when I saw her the first time I just saw a pretty redheaded introverted girl who had insecurities in her eyes but I swear you people, those were the most charming eyes I ever see, the first week ended and I didn't talk with her at all, but in the WhatsApp group that we made, one girl suggested a reunion to generate money for the next training (in those places you have to pay with the money generated with the skills that you learned) so the meeting was the next Wednesday and only she and I went.
I remember the pain in her eyes because she never talked alone with a guy and that was very weard for her but I am really good to make the introverted people a little more open, then we talk for hours and now she is my girlfriend and we are planning to get engaged soon. 
Well, the point is tell you how a single day gets into a very bad one, I really wanted to die because (I live with my mom and my little sister) our neighbors make my mom get mad and when I come home I tried to fix all in the peaceful way cause a little stress makes me feel really bad, since three weeks ago I had a high level of anxiety that gives me depression, headache, muscle get tensed, ticks and a lot of bad feelings.
Today with this people I get my top level of patience and explode into a rage attack because that woman (the neighbor) told me a lot of lies about my mom and she (my mother) raged and tried to fight, she had anxiety too and that would be extremely dangerous for her so I decided to charge her and get her into the house but she started to told me a lot of bad things about myself and I can not respond nothing to her because that could make her a strong attack so I received all the rage. 
I couldn't resist any more and I run to the bathroom and had an attack, I felt my breathing gets harder, my heart bump really faster (I do not know how to say taquicardia sorry) my legs gets weak and I started to cry, I never cried before in that way.
The only thing that I thought was to call her (my extraordinary girlfriend) but in my inside felt a little selfish because I know that is really hard to her to deal with the college and a relationship with a guy with this level of anxiety and in that moment was late but I did it anyway. I do not remember how I am in the bathroom, what do we talk, why I can not move my body (I am writing this only with my left arm), I am completely destroyed but that doesn't matter because for first time in a while I am not anxious, stressed, depressed or anything else like that, I am happy... Just happy without any other emotion and that is really a miracle, I don't remember another moment with this feeling so she saved me and I don't remember how. 
Se√±orita si en alg√∫n momento llegas a leer esto, gracias por existir y dejarme ser parte de tu vida, te admiro por lograr que me sienta pleno y prometo hacerte feliz el resto de tu vida, TE AMO.

f4wg5p,Federal_Loan,[Discussion] Can't stop procrastinating. Suspicion of overload.,"My  case of procrastination seems a little different...at least from the outside. I have a wife and three little kids, a full time job and I am enrolled in an MSc program of a local University. 

Meanwhile (and I think everyday about that), I plan to leave my current job eventually - due to various  reasons, it's a military job - and I need hard skills to be able to hit  the ground running when I'm out.

One part of  the plan is to grow an online business (eCommerce or based on  skills I  self-study/get from the MSc - e.g. a tutoring business). To do any of this, I need time and motivation to study and there are many resources available to  do that. 

What I (seem to be able to) do, is aimlessly keep collecting and organizing resources for study and finding it extremely difficult to start studying even **one** of them (can't choose what to  follow and  study in depth). 

I'm sure some of you have experienced this kind of overloading confusion - the choice paradox? - but you get the idea anyway...

What are your thoughts  on this? How can I overcome the confusion and procrastination  wave and  get myself disciplined to use my time productively?",0,1581884156,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f4wg5p/discussion_cant_stop_procrastinating_suspicion_of/,GetMotivated,1

f4pane,sylsau,[Discussion] How much importance do you give to numbers when you publish content?,"You may be one of the people who publish content online.

It could be YouTube videos, or articles on your blog, or content on Instagram.

Either way, I'd like to know how important numbers are to you.

Do you spend a lot of time studying the statistics associated with each of the content you publish?

Do you sometimes not publish certain content for fear of losing some of your followers?

I share my point of view here: [**If You Want to Do Things That Make a True Difference, Stop Looking for Numbers**](https://medium.com/@ssaurel/if-you-want-to-do-things-that-make-a-true-difference-stop-looking-for-numbers-ae7ac0a9a4ba)

Personally, I think it's a mistake to do so.

I think that to make a real difference, you have to stop putting too much emphasis on numbers.

f4gaom,Cramped_Hand,SIMPLE and EFFECTIVE tool to get you unstuck," 

There‚Äôs no good reason not to get up and go. Well, there are plenty of reasons, but the abundance of excuses not to do something is such that you could never do anything in your whole life and feel justified because of the long list of ‚Äúgood reasons‚Äù. And then you‚Äôre just looking up at a barrier of doubts, fears, and stipulations that keep you from the things that seem risky. So what then? What the fuck have you made out of your list? 

It‚Äôs mind bending to have this ethereal wall that is functionally identical to a physical obstruction. A perfect cage of your own making that prevents you from moving forward. Something like that can be even more effective than its tangible counterpart. How the hell do you knock down a wall that doesn‚Äôt exist? Maybe (probably) you don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs there in the first place, yet it silently and obstinately impedes. 

The construction of such a diabolical snare begins as soon as you learn to be afraid. Every imagined peril, scolding adult, and self-doubt adds to the elaborate design of your own personal maze. The fear can be so effective, so paralyzing and shocking, that anything beyond the high walls of perceived safety and stability seems like a fatal error waiting to happen. The mere threat of an intruder or unwanted outcome causes you to retreat further into your ego. You become the Minotaur wandering aimlessly in the dark, so deeply immersed in complex self-delusion that you are unable to see the beautiful simplicity of escape.

There always is, always has been, and always will be a way out. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up for not seeing it. Some people never do. But for every wall, cage, cave, maze, or beast‚Äôs belly you may find yourself within, there is a goddamn sledgehammer. A tool simple in design and function, yet limitless and unprejudiced in its application that will allow you to break through any obstacle. It is the ability to acknowledge your fear and choose to smash the everloving shit out of it. This is the way in which you may destroy that which has no physical form. Indeed, this weighty gilded implement of power is inside you, and emblazoned on its handle are the words, ‚ÄúFuck It‚Äù.",0,1581803098,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f4gaom/simple_and_effective_tool_to_get_you_unstuck/,GetMotivated,1

f4b2co,throwaway59423,[Story] From Quiet to Loud,"Hey all. I've started to actively use Reddit because of a recent depression episode that struck. me. **hard**. It happened despite already going to therapy twice a week and seeing improvement for the past month. I knew that my time in therapy is limited, so I decided that Reddit might just be the place to find support. Upon being here, I've come to realize that I wasn't the only one that thinks overcoming adversity is hard. But the more I contributed to different communities, the more I realized that I've overcome enough adversity to be well-equipped in doing so. It was these contributions that helped me remember that I have done it before. I wanted to share one with you all.

I grew up in a hole. My mother has psychosis, my father most likely has an unchecked mental illness, and my brother is definitely suicidal. These 3 people raised little me under terrible circumstances. Their fear and misconception of the world became mine. More importantly, I didn't know my mother was psychotic so I trusted everything she said. Her psychosis translated to ""my husband is domestically violent"" and ""my husband is having an affair and the adulteress has visited me before"" while I was growing up. The former was her illness-induced paranoia and delusion while the latter was visual hallucination. Needless to say, I believed her and lived the same way too up until I was 22 (late 2018). Because she believed her husband was abusive, she became controlling of my life. I was not allowed to do anything but to go to school, go home, eat, and sleep. ""Everyone is evil. Everyone is sent by your father to stalk us. We cannot trust anyone!"" Clearly, I lived the world blinded by fear and lies. I had no friends, I could not take multiple opportunities, I could not go outside, and I hated it. I never spoke a word to my family or anyone for 15 years of my life. 

All I desired growing up was to escape my family. I hated them for being so restrictive. When I was 15 and knew that the college admissions process was coming up, I decided that I needed to fix this problem. My deep-seated, raging anger came out when one neglect from my mother almost had me lost in New York City forever. I had no phone, did not know where I was, did not understand how to read maps or take the subway alone, did not know how to talk to people and a bunch of ""did not know."" I was living in a hole after all. I miraculously found my mother in Chinatown, NYC, and I flipped the hell out. I told her that I didn't even know how to take the train because she was so controlling of me. Because it was the first I ever spoke to her, she listened. She let go.

I then thought about what my plan would be to escape. I knew that college meant I could get the hell out of my family and the city. I also knew that getting better at my academics was meaningless. So what if I was academically smart? This little me over here doesn't even know how to talk to people! I decided that the most important thing to work on was my biggest weakness: my inability to speak.

I stopped caring about my academics and focused on that. I was thinking long-term, not short-term. I immediately got 3 jobs and made sure I was in the center of all human beings. 1 was the front desk during the busiest time at a hospital as almost all employees had their annual physical to be done by my office. 1 was a translating job at a hospital to women in labor, where I had to somehow use one of my native languages despite never using it. The other was on the floor and the chute of a thrift shop. Oh, I did all 3 jobs at once. Life got so busy, I didn't even understand fear was. I remember making a lot of mistakes. In one phone call to some employee at 1 of the hospitals, I was yelled at for being unprofessional. My boss excused my behavior, knowing I was just 15. In the other, I was brought into a room of someone delivering their child within the first 3 seconds I stepped into the ward. Shit was crazy but I went back to senior year of high school feeling a lot more confident in myself. More importantly, I was desperate to grow more and was willing to go for it.

After the 3 jobs, I started the 4th which I was at for a year. I was working on a public campaign, winning people's advocacy. I was also working with almost 30 employees from all walks of life, befriending all of them. I would've never thought that 6 months of constant effort meant that I could take a job right after, doing some of the most people-oriented things ever. 

Fast forward to college, I was getting jobs just from talking to people. People loved me upon meeting me at events. 

I didn't realize the beauty of all of this until recently (from trying to fully recover from depression): what was once my biggest fear and weakness became my biggest strength. The intent to work on it, the aggressive steps I took, and massive consistency changed my life forever. Now, I'm the biggest talker ever. 

Who would've thought? 

Problems seem so difficult to solve, especially as we get older and become more aware. If we just applied the faith that we'll get through it, that's enough to jump-start change. You gotta believe in it. 

I hope this story doesn't rub anyone the wrong way, but there is hope to everything! I'm not perfect neither am I happy. I am not as aggressive, ambitious, nor dedicated as 15-year-old me. I am still wrestling with depression, despite thinking I was taking all the steps to really overcome it since May of 2019! It looks like there were a few misunderstandings that were key in jeopardizing the change I wanted. But it's OK. 10 months of active effort gave me data to really figure out what wasn't working, what was working, what progress has been made, and what I need to change going forward. I'm working on it now! And I think I really might come out of this storm, finally!",1,1581781443,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f4b2co/story_from_quiet_to_loud/,GetMotivated,1

f4acpz,Chellz93,"[Tool] If You're Feeling Lost, You Can Bounce Back!!","It is extremely common to feel like you are stuck in a rut or failing behind in life. This can lead you feeling lost and without direction.

Steve Jobs‚Äô 2005 Stanford Commencement speech highlights a few key lessons that might help with this. It helped me when I felt this way. You need to know that patience and perspective is the key to personal growth and picking yourself back up. So be sure to ask yourself the right questions and know that feeling lost in life is only temporary.

Steve Jobs is one of the most iconic figures in history and his Stanford speech highlights how he rose up from his lowest points and ended up taking Apple to greater heights than ever before.

I hope this video can give you the motivation that you need to overcome whatever it is that you are going through.

f44d9i,Androneda,[Discussion] I am too afraid to become an adult and venture out into the world.,"I'm 21. Throughout and after high school, I have suffered anxiety and depression so pervasive that it has stopped me from accomplishing the most essential things that nearly every young adult has done. I don't have a driver's license. I haven't worked since I was 16. I am not currently in college due to crushing depression, social anxiety and transportation issues, after completing half the credits for my intended degree in environmental science and biology, which out of all the options, is my most passionate subject. Of the few things I look forward to, it's working in the field and with other people who are passionate about wildlife and the environment. 

What I want most in the world right now is a purpose, a group of friends, and a position where I can affect positive change in the world. I am stuck in a horrible rut with a toxic, unhelpful family who would rather make themselves feel better by trampling over me than actually help propel me forward. I have nobody who can really assist me. I am alone and scared. The smallest tasks are sometimes the hardest.

I believe the center of my problems lie with my internal motivation, of which I have little to none. My family has never pushed me to chase my dreams, they just say unhelpful and even hurtful things like ""man up and get a job."" They are the epitome of the toxic, unhelpful, self-centered older generation that have little to no awareness of mental health, and think depression and anxiety are basically excuses and can be overcome with some hard work. Despite trying to explain it, I find it impossible to talk to them about my mental health and so I don't talk to them at all about it.

My parents have worsened my symptoms, cause me stress and unease, and have pushed me to the brink more times than I count. My entire life I've endured bullying, put-downs, judgment, verbal assault and a rough home life, where I can never be left in peace. There are few positive interactions between myself and my parents. I am okay with my siblings, but I barely talk to them either. Most days I am cooped up in my room, broken, sad, and empty. **I am truly lonely and it is destroying me inside.**

My family is not a happy normal family that sends its kids off to college, helps them, and gives them useful advice for their life to lead them on the road to success. I got no advice about life skills, finances, and basic survival out in the world, most of what I know is self-taught. My parents expected me to graduate high school and move out. I didn't do any of that because they didn't prepare me for it and I am crippled by mental illness. The moment I finished high school I knew my future looked grim.

I lost my brother last summer which completely crushed all hopes I had for my future, and directly led to the worsening of my situation. It drove me to stay inside, avoid interactions with people, not get a job, not work on my license (which I know I am capable of because I have seen the kind of people who drive), and not apply to classes. I am stuck in the mud, lost, and afraid. With no friends at all and my only social interaction being negative family members, my will to fight on is rapidly draining. I desperately need help.

My essential goals right now are: get a license and car, get a simple part-time job, return to college, and become more confident about every day tasks. I have been told before to try therapy, but even the thought of therapy sends my anxiety through the roof. I am scared to talk to someone about my inner struggles.

Thank you for reading. I look forward to all responses and I will truly appreciate anybody who takes the time to respond to me!",11,1581740453,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f44d9i/discussion_i_am_too_afraid_to_become_an_adult_and/,GetMotivated,1
