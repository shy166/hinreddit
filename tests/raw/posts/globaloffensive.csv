I tried verifying files on steam, reinstalling it, but have yet to get to DDU or anything like that.  Video shows the problem which is:  When I start the game it initializes fine,  but the screen never changes from my desktop, even though the screen interface from CSGO is still registering.  I can click on menus in CSGO and the audible clicks that happen when you mouse-over one happen, but the screen never changes.

So I joined a usual community server this pm around 230-ish GMT+1. 

We‚Äôre all seeing weird glitches all related to player models, such as the player models moving forward but not walking just gliding on the floor, them not holding weapons properly, and doing a weird duck pose when crouching. 

ETA: on T-side I had sometimes a CT model, and sometimes even the model would change with another of the same side (ie CT-SAS to CT-GIGN), which doesn‚Äôt happen normally

fsg15w,birkir,Here is exactly what Valve have said about 128 tick servers,"It's been *seven years* since GeT_RiGhT explained *what he understood* was *one of Valve's thoughts* regarding 128 tick servers. The explanation comes from [this ESEA interview](https://youtu.be/GKcVWGOtjdg?t=276), dated Sept 20, 2013 and here it is verbatim: 

&gt;They came back to people, their computers, and saying like, and they were actually showing us how many players are using good computers and that number is scary to see. It's not even many. It was ridiculous. They were actually counting it out, it was like... I'm not gonna figure or say something I don't know, because I don't remember exactly the whole thing but it was like... from 0-30 FPS it was like 60% of players... it was a ridiculous amount. I don't know if it actually was that, so don't take the count exact for what I'm saying, but it was something similar, it was ridiculously high. And they was answering like, and they're using 128 tick for example, your computer is not responding well to it, so that's one of the reasons they have 64 tick still. They were saying most people playing matchmaking were those players. 

Next response we have is from May 6, 2018: 

&gt;**Q:** Dumb question but are 128 tick servers too expensive? Also any plans to add overtime? 

&gt;**A**: [It's not a dumb question. We see this request often. **The problem is actually that most players would actually be disadvantaged playing on 128 tick because they can't keep up**. So we'd need to segment the players which would lead to longer queue times.... Still may be worth it, tho](https://twitter.com/basisspace/status/993278875349041152)

&gt;**A2**: [CSGO is popular around the world, almost half of our players play on systems (and net connections) that are not new or particularly fast.](https://twitter.com/basisspace/status/993281143158927360)

That's it. That's all we have. GeT_RiGhT's particularly unreliable 7-year-old narrative of an explanation he doesn't remember most relevant details of, and a newer explanation that confirms that half the playerbase would be disadvantaged against the other half on 128 tick servers, which would lead to a semi-complete segregation of the playerbase. (Still may be worth it, tho)",36,1585672144,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fsg15w/here_is_exactly_what_valve_have_said_about_128/,GlobalOffensive,2

I tried to get back into it in the past 2 weeks, climbing up the ranks. I felt like in 2015 it was really popping off, the competitive scene was blowing up, csgo youtubers were becoming popular etc.. But now I feel like all the excitement has gone out the window. Big youtubers who were once super popular now barely pull more than 15k views, csgo is no longer mainstream or as popular on twitch. A lot of the pros I followed from back then have completely left the scene. 

Even though there are supposedly more users because the game has become Free to Play, the game feels empty to me. The community that once present around the game has vanished almost entirely.",11,1585670838,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fsfmjg/is_csgo_dying/,GlobalOffensive,0

fse9lw,sjtsc,A mistake rookies make,"I've seen a lot of players tryharding at this game to be top of the scoreboard, and copying professional players plays/style/configuration. I've done it myself and it is not how you want to become better.

First, if you want to get any better for personal satisfaction, or to go pro, you should spend some time developing your mouse movement, finding your sensitivity, crosshair settings and placement, and movement in general. A lot of the plays you see are a combination of all of the above mentioned, and years behind to develop. Spend at least 30 minutes on any map practicing your movement. If you see s1mple doing awp flicks and giving insane HS, it is because he practices flicks for hours somedays. If you see him holding the crosshair close to an angle, it is because he has practiced it.

Second, play more competitive and don't be afraid to lose the game, if it helps you become a better player overall. Learn your weak spots and try to improve, also be aware of your skill level, and try to adapt to it. If you have low reaction time, don't put the crosshair right at the beginning of the corner, delay it so you can do a 1 tap etc. Same goes for playing with awp.

Third, pro's spend years playing against each other and watching demos. Let's assume f0rest plays vs olof, chances are he already has a clue what he might do in the game. Also, when you watch professionals demos, they do what they do because the others are also professional and the chance of error is small. For example, if you hold an angle with the awp, in mm they might just run in and get lucky or go off angle, something less likely to happen in professional matches. This explains some of the placement the pro's have.

Fourth, game sense. You need to play more and more to develop this, and it is best developed if you play with constant premades. You need to know when the enemies might rotate, eco, buy, where they might go. For example, i was losing 0-7 cache, and they were killing us from everywhere. Then we started holding mid, they tried to pass 3 times and couldn't.  We lost the half 7-8 and won the match 16-13. For keeping up with the game sense, you also need to communicate with your teammates regularly, give info about flashes, smokes, decoys etc.

Fifth, communication. This is key. Professionals spend 2/3 of their day practicing, playing, hanging out with the team. They do this for months and prepare for big tournaments. They know each other's weaknesses, strong sides and flaws. They breathe as one. So, whenever you see a particular play, you need to understand that it is well thought of beforehand and mastered.

I hope i have helped you a little bit.",9,1585666355,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fse9lw/a_mistake_rookies_make/,GlobalOffensive,2

I understand that there are people misunderstood about Islam but some people take it too far.

For the last month and a half, my Trust Factor has been quite bad. I'm not entirely sure why, as I only queue with my friends, and by the fact that they continue to invite me, I'm not a bad teammate, but that's not the point of this thread. I've had random days, usually about once a week, where my TF suddenly turns very high. This usually seems to be after I buy or trade something on the steam market, but for that one day, I'll have fantastic games. However, the very next day, when I have not changed anything in my behavior, it falls back to being terrible again.

With the uprising of CS:GO kids were insulting the enemy in the half and after the game more and more. CS:GO is focusing on and on about this problem and tries to release updates helping with this. But the situation is getting worse and worse. For example grown up people are insulting their teammates for bad plays heavily. Their is nearly no game with randoms were I am able to finish the game without muting one or more persons.

fs7dg8,Aymanbb,Remove scoreboard until after the match.,"It has no positive effect on an ongoing match other than being a useless distraction for everyone involved.

1. People doing well get cocky.
2. People underperforming lose confidence
3. People doing well thinking they are more skilled than others for 2+ kill difference.
4. People underperforming getting flamed.
5. Frag hunting mentality
6. Tilt tilt and tilt everywhere.

The amount of wins that could be won by people just ignoring the scoreboard and focusing on the win is too high.

Just remove it during the game, and then reveal everything afterwards.

Of course keep the mute, check profiles, match score etc. but individual scores needs to be hidden. Why?

For mental purposes only, mainly against toxicity.

I have been playing this game for 15 years combined, and all I hear every single game is two people arguing about scores every second round. People are yet to know that stuff doesnt matter at the end of the day, it's winning the match that matters.

Of course the whole getting acknowledged for good performances is important - but that is only important after the match, not during imo.",0,1585633618,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fs7dg8/remove_scoreboard_until_after_the_match/,GlobalOffensive,1

fs5byv,corvaxL,"We have a serious racism problem, and now is the time we need to address it","Ever since CS:GO went free to play, we've seen a steady uptick in growth in our player base. With the game now more accessible than ever, on top of the rise in popularity of our esports events, it's been a great time for the growth of CS, despite having been around for two decades now. Especially now with most of the world stuck at home, more and more new players will be exploring CS for the first time.

However, we have a serious demographics problem that I can't help but imagine is turning some of these would-be newcomers away. I have never been on any other online community where bigoted speech, often completely out of the blue in some sort of attempt to seem edgy, is so widely tolerated and even expected. The message this ends up perpetuating is that if you aren't a white man, you aren't welcome in CS. When new players outside this demographic hear this in game, on top of seeing pretty much no one but white men on stage at major events, I can't help but imagine that many who would otherwise dive into CS are turning right back out the door. Valve's recent moves to actually start enforcing reports of abusive chat are certainly a step in the right direction, but I haven't noticed any real impact on player behavior since that went up.

We have massive potential for growth now. Even some national governments are getting in on CS, promoting events and celebrating major-winning teams. But it may be that the greatest barrier to our growth is our own behavior. Even if it takes coordinated social campaigns from the top players, teams, and event organizers, we need to do something about this before all of these would-be new players and followers write us off.",16,1585624421,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fs5byv/we_have_a_serious_racism_problem_and_now_is_the/,GlobalOffensive,1

fs4rl9,niddLerzK,Trust Factor on CS:GO,"Hey guys, so this is my first post here, correct me anything wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing csgo since 2013/2014, more or less, and about in 2016/2017 I reached Supreme (rank). 

Since then, I stopped playing in 2017/2018, and not played since then. 1 Week ago I returned to CS:GO, manage to get a win and got placed at gold III. Ok not bad, I can climb no problem, im rusty but I got the mechanics.

Turns out I've been playing too ""good"", because basically every match I got reported, and I manage to climb to MG2, but now, my TRUST Factor says its LOW, the red zone low.

How is this affecting me:

1¬∫- What in the world is this trust factor shit, and why this exists? Its stupid.

2¬∫- The matchmaking is fucked, I just got deranked to MG1, Played 1 game and I had 2 LEM on my team, 2 silvers on the other, like... wtf is this

3¬∫- I caught alot of cheaters since I got the trust factor down (confirmed cheaters, not just good players)

4¬∫- Basically everyone is smurf, which is anoying because everyone plays good and now I can't even rank up to MG2

5¬∫- I get trollers and afk'ers everygame.

&amp;#x200B;

This ""trust"" factor fucked me real time, my satisfacion for CS decreased so much, in the last 10 matches I lost 7, mainly all trollers and smurfs.

&amp;#x200B;

ANYWAY to boost my stupid trust factor? thanks.",3,1585622122,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fs4rl9/trust_factor_on_csgo/,GlobalOffensive,1

4. Self destruct it at the perfect moment so that it hits them at their feet.

You can crush out so many games against so many people. Opponents that are way better or worse than you leads to only 5 minutes worth of bad experience. A 16-8 can easily take an hour in CS, but an 8-4 in Rocket League only takes 5 minutes. More games means you are more likely to get a good game.

Economy changes would be to make pistol less impactful, so a round 2 full save means full buy on round 3 including awps and util. Basically 1 eco gets you enough to full buy next round. This would simplify the economy a bit but makes ecos less impactful.

Open to any thoughts or changes that should be made. What do you guys think?",7,1585604125,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frzsfh/what_do_you_think_of_first_to_8_with_some_changes/,GlobalOffensive,1

frxqsq,terror569,Couple suggestions,"First things first I would love to start with saying that I really care about CSGO community and playing experience in general and have been playing this game for quite some while. 
Many of us know, that there are some things we would really appreciate, if being implemented into the game. This is just my thought process, but if anybody agrees with any of the stuff I‚Äôm about to write, feel free to leave a comment down below, whenever you agree or not. 

1. MM a.k.a. Match Making 
We seriously need new anti-cheat guys. It‚Äôs been said many, many times before and this on going problem has to stop. There are a lot of cheaters in this game, whether it‚Äôs deathmatch, casual or especially competitive ‚Äúwe are losing so I gotta turn it on‚Äù cheaters. I would welcome face.it like anti-cheat or at least improve, and I  really mean to improve the current one.
Other things that would be great to add to match making is either language filter, or something which would help us separate those who speak this or that language. I cannot count how many times I got into the team with Russians, couldn‚Äôt understand them because, well they didn‚Äôt speak English and were talking sh*t and almost kicked me just because. Now I‚Äôm not saying ALL Russians are like that, but most are. 
Now I know I can join other players to their lobby but when I‚Äôm with 3 or 4 friends of mine, there‚Äôs no way to join to someone so quickly, that the lobby wouldn‚Äôt be full before I invite all of them. 

3. Overwatch
We need more people to be doing these. We need people to be motivated with more than few level XP. We need some sort of feedback if ‚Äúthat‚Äù guy we reviewed actually got banned. We need some sort of trust factor which we can see, so more cases you review, more trusted detective you gonna become. I think people deserve a lot more for their time, reviewing cheaters in your game, than just few level XP. 

4. Demo replay improvement. 
Do I have to say more? 

5. Operations 
Well, operations and rewards for them. Operation Shattered Web cost what? ‚Ç¨15? And those rewards were... well not that great. 

Again, this is not a rant or anything, just things I would love to see in the game. Feel free to debate, I‚Äôm open to all your suggestions.

It‚Äôs been two years since we launched Mythic League. Since then over $125,000 worth of prizes have been won, and over 100 mythic league players have progressed into the FPL circuit. 

So today we are going to take the next step by offering something for all the NA teams out there, a team league which we decided to call‚Ä¶.Mythic League League. The inaugural season has both an Invite and Open division with a total prize pool of $25,000. We have invited 20 of the top North American teams to our invite division which we will announce shortly, leaving 4 spots open for any team to qualify for. The open division is open for anyone from NA to play in, with no entry fee required. All you will need is a Mythic League subscription which also gives you the ability to play in our pug divisions, and weekly cups. 

The qualifiers for the invite division will not require a subscription, and you can sign up for them here:
https://ml-face.it/mllqualifier1 - Qualifier #1: April 18-19
https://ml-face.it/mllqualifier2 - Qualifier #2: April 24-25

If so, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Play Like a Pro is your opportunity to learn skills and strategies from a seasoned professional, gain a deeper understanding of fundamental game concepts, and **become a more well-rounded competitor**.

My name is **Jordan ‚Äún0thing‚Äù Gilbert** and I‚Äôve been playing Counter-Strike for 18 years, with the last decade of my career playing competitively with top-level teams such as Evil Geniuses in CS 1.6 and Cloud9 for the majority of CS:GO. During my time as a pro I spent at least a few days a week coaching individuals playing CS:GO at various levels. After multiple years of individual coaching, I found that teaching the community as a whole via my Twitch streams and YouTube videos was more effective in reaching many more people! I‚Äôve wanted to create a course like this for awhile and have a collection of tips and tricks learned over my decade of competitive experience to share with aspiring CS:GO players. **My goal is to help shape how you view and play the game**, and in the end create more well rounded players out of everyone who takes this course.

**This course is built for players familiar with CS:GO who aspire to play at a higher level.** I will help you master various skills by providing lectures, in-game examples, and practical tips that apply to each topic. Specifically, this course will cover:

*\*Intro sections include background on myself and my journey to pro, before jumping into the following\**

* Setting up CS:GO and finding the configuration that works for you
* Mastering game mechanics, including:  

   * Aiming
   * Crosshair placement
   * Recoil control
   * Grenade usage
   * Angles &amp; positioning
   * Movement
* Communicating effectively and efficiently during the three round phases, Solo Q and team play
* Strategizing for early, mid, and late round play on both the CT and T side
* Developing a process-oriented attitude to continually practice, improve your game, and avoid ‚Äúladder anxiety‚Äù as well as getting down on yourself
* Utilizing offline servers to help practice outside ‚Äúthe game‚Äù
* Utilizing community servers (DM, Retake, Surf/KZ)
* Finding mentors and playing with/against better players
* Approaching individual practice for maximum improvement

You‚Äôll also get your hands dirty in-game by completing the activities and drills provided in each section. While the lectures will cover my best practices and key concepts for playing CS:GO, **the activities will be your chance to apply what you‚Äôve learned and find what works best for you**.

I know that this course will help you not only fine-tune your skills in-game, but also to develop the professional attitude and practice-focused mindset that got me to where I am today. **By the end of this course, you will be prepared for competitive play no matter what level you started at.** If you‚Äôre ready to start the journey to high-level CS:GO, enroll in this course today. Let‚Äôs have some fun!

**Who this course is for:**

* CS:GO players who are familiar with the game, but want to take their play to the next level.
* CS:GO players interested in learning key concepts, strategies, and practice tips from a pro.",4,1585593929,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frwkab/is_this_udemy_course_still_worth_doing/,GlobalOffensive,1

frwfpr,BoomTexan,How many kills does it take to tie in Silver I?,"This is actually ridiculous, and I guess it's impossible to Solo-Q out of Silver.

In case you didn't know, KRIMZ set the world record for kills on LAN. He got 44 frags in regulation. MIBR won in overtime. I guess he could understand my pain.

But Volvo really do need to implement some way besides just winning matches to get out of Silver. I'm tired of dropping 30 and 40 bombs and still losing. I'm about 3 more of these matches from a nervous breakdown, I can't keep carrying.

frtzmq,Knopfler2,Most efficient way to improve aim?,"Been playing CS:GO for 4 and a half years and picked up almost 4000 hours. I play in an amateur team as a rifler, I like to think ive become quite good for the level I play at and yet im still curious on an practicing aim and the routines people use. In terms of game sense, I play 2-3 pugs and 3-4 scrims every day, so that gets naturally improved through those games. However, i've never been very good at efficiently improving my aim. 

Normally, I will jump on aim bots and get 500 kills so my muscle memory kicks in and then possibly DM for 20 minutes if I have time. After that I only play games (pugs and scrims). My aim isn't bad but its clear to me that it needs improving and with quarantine i've got a lot of time to do so.

What do people do to improve their aim? How much time do you put into it? If, per say, I start deathmatching for 2 hours a day, am I going to notice significant results in a few weeks?",5,1585585782,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frtzmq/most_efficient_way_to_improve_aim/,GlobalOffensive,1

frs9jc,ImThour,Server Created is 64 Tick Despite using -tickrate 128,"Hey,

I am not sure if this has been posted before however I found this bug which is not affecting online game-play but still cause a lot of issue for me personally as I create my own local server for trying smokes.

**Description:** What happens is that despite using -tickrate 128 in your launch options, when you join a 64 Tickrate server and try to make your own server after it, it stays 64 tickrate. 

**Video Explaining this:** https://youtu.be/e3EnW6_WV1I

**Steps to Re-create:**

- Start your game using -tickrate 128 
- When you start the game, it will show you tickrate: 128
- Now, go to a Valve Official Server (64 Tickrate Server)
- Your tickrate, cmdrate and update rate will be set to 64
- Disconnect and now make your own server
- You will see it is created in 64 Tickrate 

**How it should work:** It should go back to the values of tickrate, cl_cmdrate and cl_updaterate which is in the user config after disconnecting from a server.

**TL;DR:** Despite using -tickrate 128 in your launch options, when you join a 64 Tickrate server and try to make your own server after it, it stays 64 tickrate.",6,1585580188,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frs9jc/server_created_is_64_tick_despite_using_tickrate/,GlobalOffensive,2
frs7o5,workerq1,Weapon Suggestion Idea: AK-103-S as replacement slot for AK-47,"**PICTURE IS REFERENCE, NO SCOPE**  
A silenced version as replacement to AK-47, works like M4A1-S for T side.  
Price, damage, rate of fire, spray pattern, spread deviation, reload time is the same as AK-47  
Recoil kick is less than AK-47, more than M4A4.  
Movement speed is lower (205 to AK-47's 215)  
Ammo capacity: 20/60  
Non-detachable silencer  
I'm not quite sure about the damage, could lead people to use this more than AK-47, what do you think?

I‚Äôm not gonna propose anything overly complex, just a simply, logical and rational change:

AWP costs $4750, AK costs $2700.

Just make the Krieg in between: $3700.

There aren‚Äôt any guns in this price range already, making it a weird, niche category of buy. Which is what the Krieg should be, a niche, situational gun to be purchased by like one or two players at most, *not the entire team and lose at max 5 extra HE nades*.

I‚Äôm fine with Krieg staying as it is, just like the autosniper, as long as it is *way less convenient* to buy it.

Please make another change to the Krieg before the AK meta dies out entirely. It‚Äôs a really sad and negative change for the quality of gameplay.",34,1585579665,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frs44c/nerf_krieg/,GlobalOffensive,1

frrymu,Mutazsam,My experience with CSGO Stuttering," Hello everyone and I hope you are all fine and having good time.

in this topic I'm gonna share my experience with cs go stuttering.

first of all I have to say that I have +6k hrs and have played cs go competitively for more than 3 years.

cs go stuttering made a lot for me. so I have put a lot of time in google and reddit trying to find a real fix for this Issue, I have read and tried every single tweak u could think about but nth worked for me, they were too much tweaks here and there and in different forums so it's hard to mention them all.

I've noticed lately that a lot of people suffering from this problem noticeably, but it seems like no one cares (Valve).

I have +200 fps in 95% of the situations in this game but I have a lot of problems, starting from stuttering going through heavy mouse movement and weird spray pattern when there's a fight, some micro freezes and weird spray pattern

If u guys just use reddit search and put stutter as a keyword for your search u gonna find people with high end pcs suffering from the same problem and all of them can confirm that they might have a day with smooth game play with no problem and the next day everything is fked up.

what drives me crazy, this game runs in 300 fps and we still suffer from performance issues while other games runs on 100 and everything is fine.

should we upgrade our pcs every year to play a game released in 2012?

u guys can say anything but plz don't say this is a placebo or smth like this.

sorry for this long post but I have a feeling that I have to share this maybe this gonna change something specially after the last update.

Thank you.

PS: I could mention tweaks and posts I've read about the stuttering in comments with u.

frrrb5,Eriscium,Trust Factor is a massive joke,"TL;DR at bottom

Disclaimer: my game is in french so I might not describe all the CS:GO buttons as they would appear on an english game.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here to rant about how my trust factor has been completely screwed over in 1 game. Please read until the end because this just shows how messsed up this game can get. 

Yesterday, my Counter-Strike experience in matchmaking was fine, no cheaters at all (I'm currently LEM) in 2 years of gameplay: I never met once any blatant cheater/spinbotter/waller.

I usually don't use the ""Find a group"" function to find a premade before queuing, but somehow I got invited by 2 global elites and an LEM.

They were from Germany, so I thought ""why not?""

We start queuing, and I see that one of the guys in the group has a ""considerably lower trust factor"". I immediately feel that something's wrong and that this MM game's gonna go south... However, as I'm thinking of whether I should just leave the group, we find a match in less than 15 seconds (never seen that before). I think to myself, ""This feels darn wrong, my MM queue time has never been under 1 min"" but I just thought it would piss the 4 other people in the group if I just left so I accept the match.

What a fucking blunder. This is what the game was: [https://imgur.com/a/9Oj2Cuz](https://imgur.com/a/9Oj2Cuz) basically a HVH.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever it is, the game ends, I guess our team had better ""players"" and we win 16-5. After that, I played 3 games in the afternoon, which went with no issue and all: [https://imgur.com/a/tb7ddo8](https://imgur.com/a/tb7ddo8)

&amp;#x200B;

And this morning, I just tried to play... and what the actual f\*ck just happened.

&amp;#x200B;

First I lose 0-16 and 0-16 to blatant cheaters: [https://imgur.com/a/8duBDzg](https://imgur.com/a/8duBDzg) ; [https://imgur.com/a/s9WvTHM](https://imgur.com/a/s9WvTHM) We get absolutely smashed (was playing with legit players).

I thought that maybe I was just unlucky and tried playing again this afternoon: this time I had cheaters only in my team: [https://imgur.com/a/5SGhXU6](https://imgur.com/a/5SGhXU6)

&amp;#x200B;

This is what my game has become after playing 1 game with cheaters. 1 game and I can't even play anymore. Valve, what the actual hell?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even going to try and start a 4th competitive. I don't want to pay for ESEA, Faceit or ECL... Now what do I do?  I could certainly afford a 7$ monthly subscribtion but darn, for a PC game that I play casually... No.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading, I hope you all have a great day.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : Randomly ended up in a game with cheaters, and since my matchmaking experience has been hell.",0,1585578450,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frrrb5/trust_factor_is_a_massive_joke/,GlobalOffensive,1
frrkpg,kasumeme,"CSGO Blur Target - Unable to find panel with the given id ""sliding-panel--TERRORIST""! Panel is possibly created dynamically.","So I have a friend who's been playing CS:GO for around over a year now, he uses a laptop with relatively bad specs and lag spikes every now and then, but overall his game experience was enjoyable and normal.

However, just a few days ago, he was unable to play normally as before; he's reported being unable to see at all when joining an online match but still able to move shoot interact etc., and while he almost has no problem playing custom matches with me sometimes the texture glitches out for him too. (sorry for being unable to provide pics)

Apparently, he's encountering 2 sorts of errors?  
1.  **Resource materials\\panorama\\images\\icons\\equipment.svg failed to load**  
2.  **CSGO Blur Target - Unable to find panel with the given id ""sliding-panel--TERRORIST""! Panel is possibly created dynamically. CSGO Blur Target - Unable to find panel with the given id ""sliding-panel--CT""! Panel is possibly created dynamically. Giving up attempts to make more random spawn points. Current count: 48.**   
More worrying is the second one, which he has reported that he was spammed with the message.

He has tried the basics like verifying integrity of game files, uninstalling and reinstalling the game and disabling antivirus, but nothing worked.

Please, if anyone has/knows someone who encountered such situations, suggest us some fixes for these problems, as right now we have reached a wall in solving it.

frr37e,Mistallus,"Maps, gameplay after Operation Shattered Web?","As today is the last day we can complete Shattered Web missions, I began wondering what the operation's end will give us players.

&amp;#x200B;

A theory exists that de\_aztec and de\_dust may make their return, as per [cryptic tweets from Valve](https://win.gg/news/3270/csgo-devs-and-templar-assassin-hint-at-aztec-dust-map-returns). So we could see the return of some old (or rather ancient) favorites, possibly altered to suit competitive play better, similar to what they did with Vertigo.

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, it wouldn't be very unlikely that the custom agents may get removed. They are already banned by FaceIt and there have been numerous complaints about them in MM.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the operation's maps, I predict dz\_junglety will stay and de\_studio will be removed. I'm not sure about ar\_lunacy though.

Games will start at 7pm BST on all 3 days. 

The format is: 8 teams total, 2 groups of 4 teams. Best of 1 round robin format in the groups, top 2 teams from each group advance to the playoffs. Best of 1 semifinals and a best of 3 grand final. If we don't get 8 teams, the format will be changed slightly. 

There is a ¬£5 buy in fee per team, which goes into the prize pool. Each member of the winning team gets ¬£7, the admin pick MVP gets ¬£2.50, and the community pick MVP gets ¬£2.50. 

Most teams we get are around the MG-LE level, and we are planning on casting all the games possible. 

If you'd like to spend a few evenings playing CS:GO with your friends in a chill environment, possibly for some money, just message me anywhere and I'll invite you to the discord, where everything is organised.

frk39y,AloXii_,Can anyone give me some tips on how to become a better player? I‚Äôm a solo queue player in S5.,"Clearly I‚Äôm not that good.

My warmup:
Go to aim_botz.
Do the 100 kill challenge but change it to 20 kills. (Go only for headshots)
Do this for at least 300 kills or up to 1000.
My time is usually around ~9 seconds all the way up to ~11 seconds if I‚Äôm having a bad time.

My hardware(?):
Gaming laptop (~120 FPS)
Sennheiser hd 559 headphones
Logitech g602 mouse (dislike it because it‚Äôs way too heavy for me)
No microphone because I can‚Äôt afford one. (I do still use my mic ingame but it obviously isn‚Äôt good.)

My in-game settings:
16:9 1920x1080 (don‚Äôt like stretch because I already have very bad vision)
500 dpi 1.4 in-game
Raw input
No mouse accel
Viewmodel (varies)
Crosshair (varies)

My stats:
270 wins
34 ties
246 loses 
20.4% accuracy (I know, very bad.)
33% headshots
KD: 1.59

Maps I play:
1st: Dust 2
2nd: Mirage
3rd: Cache

I have very bad anxiety so I don‚Äôt even bother learning other maps because I fear I‚Äôll forget the calls mid game and cause my team to lose.

I only solo queue (and occasionally play with my s4 brother.) because I don‚Äôt have many friends.

What can I do to personally improve? Is my warm up bad or am I just a bad player? 

I have around 1.3k hours (1k of those were on a pc that couldn‚Äôt get 30 FPS and I was s1)

Any tips at all would be helpful.",18,1585541884,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frk39y/can_anyone_give_me_some_tips_on_how_to_become_a/,GlobalOffensive,1

frgl8a,joao7yt,Disabling only *enemies* custom skins for everyone in a competitive mode is the real solution to the skins being abused.,"I'm sure it has already been suggested, but I don't care, let's just keep making noise about it.

It's simple: I'm not talking about an option to disable them, I'm talking about disabling them **ON THE ENEMY SIDE** by default for everyone playing a competitive mode (including wingman).

If this gets changed, we might see skins' prices go down, and if skins' prices goes down because of it, then we would know skins were being used as an advantage purpose and not as a fun purpose, and that should not be the case. You should still be able to see teammates' skins, because that would not affect gameplay and would still be fun, but I don't see any other reason to have enemies seeing you looking different other than to take advantage of it, and that is nasty.",100,1585527668,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frgl8a/disabling_only_enemies_custom_skins_for_everyone/,GlobalOffensive,4

frg2c0,SupLads142,Steam Group Made For Pricechecks &amp; Trading,"


I would like to help by pricechecking most of the items that are posted in this group. This group can also be used for trading if needed. If you dont know how much a skin is worth because there is a expensive sticker on there.. i can help. Have much experience. I can also pricecheck case hardeneds.

If you would like to help out with this group by pricechecking then sent me a message. If i see any attempted scamming it will result in a permanent ban and block.

Have experience in most cases of katos, case hardeneds, hard to trade items and normal market price skins. Could convert everything in usd, euros, Chinese yen and Cash in all those currencies.

**Pricechecks are not always 100% accurate, We all can make mistakes, please dont pricecheck if you dont have any knowledge**

frfzqr,MathTheState,Request: Let us report the type of abusive/toxic communication,"The new effort to combat abusive communication in game is great and it can be improved with a little more specificity.  There would be many advantages of adding check boxes for the type of abusive communication.

* Improve the accuracy of reports by looking for consistency.  For example, let's say players A and B each receive 100 reports but 90% of A's reports are for spam while B's reports are spread evenly over all categories.  It's far more likely that player A is spamming and less likely that they are being reported out of spite compared to player B.

* Informing players why they are being reported can help them change their behavior.  If players are penalized for abusive communication then it is easier for them to avoid further reports if they know why they are being reported.  I'd bet most toxic players know how they are being toxic but even if all they care about is not getting reported it would still be helpful to know what they are being reported for.

* Data about types of abusive communication can inform further efforts to combat toxicity.  Going after the most common types of toxicity would be more effective than simply trying to reduce abusive communication in general.

Collecting this data would not be any more difficult than collecting data about the other types of reports.  I think improved efforts to reduce toxicity would make CSGO much more welcoming for new players and improve our in-game experiences in overall.",4,1585525464,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frfzqr/request_let_us_report_the_type_of_abusivetoxic/,GlobalOffensive,0

There is also another problem, my amount of FPS is directly relative of the speed of my movements. For example if I just go forward I get 110-120 FPS but if I move my camera very quickly I get around 300 FPS. I got this problem for months, I noticed it disappears when I update my windows  and appears again when I update CS:GO. I tried to reinstalled my game, my drivers are up to date.

frdv9l,AllMyNicksAreStolen,Quite possibly the reason why you have such a bad experience on FACEIT servers,"First: Personally, I love the idea of ANTI WALLHACK, so with that out of the way, let us look at the basics behind everything:

During one second your computer is fed with 128 frames (server updates) in an interval of 7,8 milliseconds between each update.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

&amp;#x200B;

The maximum size of the packets you can receive is 1200 bytes. The server will though try to send larger packets when there is a lot happening on the server.

* An example of this is when an enemy player peeks you on a server with ANTI WALLHACK (AW):

&amp;#x200B;

**Lets compare with a server running NO ANTI WALLHACK (NAW).** Your client will know the location of the enemy player before he peeks you, meaning that your client will be able to interpret the movement the enemy player starts when he goes for the peek. In short, you will first see his shoulder, then his head, and then his other shoulder.

&amp;#x200B;

**On a AW-server there is no information about the enemy's location before he peeks.** So when it is decided that you are in a position to see or hear the enemy player, the server will send you this information. Using wireshark you will be able to confirm that when an enemy player who is not seen or heard by you or your teammates goes for a peek, you will receive a frame which is divided into two packets instead of one, because of the server trying to send a packet larger than 1200 bytes. And there can be a sequel of them.

&amp;#x200B;

*Okei.. So what's the issue with receiving a frame in two packets?* In general it seems to be no big deal. BUT... On ex. FACEIT servers this can be an issue. Lets say frame 21 consists of packet A and packet B. On FACEIT you will quite often see a big gap between when Packet A and when Packet B is received. As an example Packet can Arrive at 21:15:32,001000 and packet B at 21:15:32:031000. That is 30 milliseconds and in that timeframe you should have received 3 frames and have 1.2 milliseconds for the fourth frame to arrive, and this is huge. In these situations you will quite possibly experience enemy players starting to have unnatural movements. If you measure the time from when frame 20 was displayed to when frame 21 have ran through the system, the overall jitter and latency will be at an amount where it has an effect on the clock correction as well. Basically it's GAME OVER.

**So what is causing these issues, and why specifically on FACEIT?**  
The performance of the servers are unstable.""Bind mwheelup stats"" and scroll upwards while running around on the server. As soon as the server starts using more than 7,8 milliseconds to generate a frame, you will begin to see splitpackets arrive with a huge gap between them. Check ""stats"" in console at the start of the match and see that if the ""Svms"" is laying around 2,xx ms - 4,xx ms you will have no issues, but later in the same game everthing can suddenly desync, and the ""Svms"" is all of a sudden constantly at 7,xx with higher spikes.

* In general you will se packets arrive in random intervals (use wireshark):|| ||| |||| |||| ||||| |||| || |  | |||| |||| || ||| ||| ||| |||| || | |||| |||| |||||   |  | |||| ||||||| || | || | || |.....

*Okei, so use an interp\_ratio of 2 since what we're experiencing is basically the same as having packet drops.* Actually this is worse than packet drops, since this also affects clock correction for the most of us. It will not help running around with ""64 ticks"". Your client will still receive packets at random intervals and when enemy players peek, you will still lack the information the game client needs to correctly interpret the ""peeking"" players movement.

&amp;#x200B;

* You will also experience receiving split frames on servers without AW, like on a FFA DM server with 20 players, but the impact is higher on FACEIT servers (due to the latency between the arrival of the packets). Popular community servers most often run on high quality setups and that is probably the reason why they are popular in the first place (?).

&amp;#x200B;

**SO why does this affect players in the same game differently?**

* High ping will cause the game client to have a clock correction which is already adjusted above the ""area"" where we experience issues (will still be affected in some ways).
* Midrange ping will always be affected because of how the timing of packets interfere with the client sided clock correction (this is just a claim -&gt; I cannot prove this because the console variable ""cl\_clock\_showdebuginfo"" is only available with sv\_cheats 1).
* Extremly low ping (will still be affected in some ways).
* ISP network issues. Most of the playerbase out there will have some network issues caused by lack of optimization from the ISP. Should they all be punished?

&amp;#x200B;

**BOTTOM LINE:**  
ANTI WALLHACK will either way cause latency in some ways and with the consequences of todays server performance,  more often than not, it will greatly affect the game experience of most of the playerbase. Generally it seems like a good idea to avoid split packets and AW is increasing the amount of split packets.

* Even players with massive ISP issues will have a better experience when they receive fewer split packets.

&amp;#x200B;

I am Silver 1, but do be honest I have 28 competitive wins and I've had the game since it came out. I've hardly played ranked, so I don't know if Silver 1 is my proper rank, but it probably is. I don't know what sensitivity to use, I just can't decide. I currently use 800 DPI and 2 Ingame. I see people being like global and it's crazy how good they are. I know I'm not going to be global but I thought I would be a bit better than silver 1. I have been gaming all of my life!

Does anyone have any tips? Like should I do the bomb maps? Or Dust 2 only? I solo queue by the way! Thanks.",14,1585517440,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frdqg7/i_suck_soo_bad_at_this_video_game/,GlobalOffensive,0

frdawx,kvothethechandrian,So how's been new Cache doing for you?,"In my opinion, it's not a fun map right now for me, and it's way worse than before the update. I liked to play it a lot.

Im not a fan of that lamp post on the B site, but that site is mostly ok, apart from some visibility issues on the CT-B connector.

However, I'm not a fan of mid. Boost now seems much easier to punish as a CT. The boost now feels like mirage window for Ts, it's so overpowered now that you don't have to commit 2 people, and you cannot ignore that position, it's annoying. Before it was high risk, high reward, but now it's more like mid-low risk, high reward, specially when CTs play with 2 or more in mid.

In A, that new white box really helps as CT on the retake, so it's a nice change, although I don't like the increased visibility from truck to A. It makes it much more difficult to win in the post plant for me, because CTs have so much information before entering the site and committing. That ""tank"" in the middle of A site is also weird to wrap around and pre-aim common angles (I preferred the box before) although it's a matter of getting used to.

Honestly this feels a map that became more execution-heavy towards each site so it's not really fun anymore for me. In the old iteration, we could as T gain a lot of space in middle and make plays/splits, I would even go towards CT connector a lot of times, but now I can't, it feels like I don't have mid control ever as T.

frce5r,nakydafishy,Olofmeister Performance the Past Year,"I don't know whether it is just me at this point but after having watched FaZe games for the past year and having tracked olofmeister's progression on the roster, I just do not see how he is still earning a spot on the team. Currently, he takes up either the spot that an IGL with similar fragging ability would have (.98 hltv rating past 3 months) or a new talent that would excel like broky.

The main point of this post:

------It seems as though olofmeister flies under the rader every roster change season and people instead throw the problems of FaZe SOLELY on the lack of an IGL (not that this isn't a big problem)--------

1. To address the people that continue after every one of his bad performances to use the excuse of him playing ""the bitch"" spots, it is blatant from watching other teams that this player should act as a sort of X factor for the team that can take them to new heights (stewie on liquid) or is atleast able to hold down an entire certain part of a map due (flusha on t side of banana inferno). However, watching olofmeister on both the t and ct sides, it becomes apparent he literally exists to fill the role and not excel in it as other players have done.



RESOLUTION

There is a wealth of talent in sweden at the moment that lacks direction. Aside from dennis, hampus, and a few others, there is a lack of true experience left in the swedish talent pool. Seeing as olofmeister could excel by playing on a team with better chemistry, more cohesion, and MOST importantly, the ability for him to become a star player instead of a side player, it makes sense for him to return to sweden.

frb7hr,allnaturaltuna,Deagle price should be raised to $900,"The deagle price should be raised to $900. In high-level CS it is to easy for pro's to win deagle rounds, you only need a high level of aim to use the gun effectively and pro's shouldn't be consistently winning deagle rounds against rifles in the new economy which supports buying rifles consistently. At a price tag of $700 or $1700 with armor you shouldn't be able to steal rounds easily against enemies with rifles and full armor. 
If the price is raised to $900 it would transition the deagle from eco-buying it to an actual risk of force-buying in the game again.",10,1585508661,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/frb7hr/deagle_price_should_be_raised_to_900/,GlobalOffensive,1

 Bada is a Portuguese gaming fan (mostly csgo) and he's very supportive of the Portuguese csgo scene. He suffers from an illness and needed a new wheelchair that costed around 7000‚Ç¨. The community saw this and many Portuguese streamers and orgs (mostly of Fifa and csgo) saw this and started doing charity streams and giving away money for the cause. Still 7000‚Ç¨ is a lot of money and so, they organized an all-star csgo tournament with the participant ranging from the biggest csgo streamers to players to just streamers in general and all of the profits went to Bada's cause. Because of this +6000‚Ç¨ were earned and now Bada is very close to having his chair. Just wanted to share this with you guys because we're in a time of need and its nice to see the gaming community unite for such a good cause.",24,1585506308,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fraj8s/portuguese_gaming_community_raised_6000_for_a_fan/,GlobalOffensive,11

fr7h5m,Liu_Xiang,"Left Handed Players Experiment. Hi Woxic, any imput?","I'm a leftie, always played right because that is the norm, tho with the expanse of peripherals this might change in the future.

\-Ever since i started CSGO i always was competitive and would take it serious so i used a custom map to gauge my skill and how much i improve over time. Like Adren's csgo\_training2 vid, same settings.

Fast reflex, 0.4 respawn, size 10 etc.  
\-as a noob i would do maybe 7-10 hits with my right hand max until they dissappeared.

\-at ge i did about 50-60 out of 100

\-now as Faceit 10 guy i do 100 and over.  
But i still feel like my aim is my biggest problem because its inconsistent.  


One day i decided to try my left hand that i never used.

\-as a noob leftie i was doing 60-70, wich took me YEARS to get at with my right hand.

.\_. sooo i tried it for 1 week. It improved to like an average of 80 for my left hand aim, but i cant get my right hand to adjust to any keyboard leftie layout ive found, its so hard.  
I realize it's kinda common sense, i do everything with my left, it can do anything better than my right except maybe aiming for NOW cuz i've been using the right hand just for that.  
No surprise it seems to perform better at the task even if new at it and adapts quicker as well.

Here's to all the lefties that probably gimped themselves cuz of no alternatives.  


I wish i knew what Woxic thought of this and if he always played left or changed.",2,1585495272,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fr7h5m/left_handed_players_experiment_hi_woxic_any_imput/,GlobalOffensive,1

fr5xm3,csgopleasehelp,"Hi Reddit, my colour blind friend quit the game after almost 5 years of playing due to the agent skins. This is our last resort. Here is what we think could solve the agent skin problem for the colour blind player-base.","Hi Reddit, it's my first time making a reddit post so please bare with me. I'm making this post on behalf of my friend and the **80,000 players** who this affects on a daily basis. 

I introduced my colour blind friend to csgo in late 2015. These past 5 years have honestly been the greatest years of our lives so far, so many good memories and moments, we even went to the Faceit Major London in 2018. I am Supreme in MM and he (was) Legendary Eagle.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My friend suffers from **deuteranomaly** which is the term for **red-green colourblindness**. You can read about this [here](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/)  [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/eyYDT) are some images that portray what this type of colourblindness appears to the sufferer. If you don't have the time to check that out, here is the main point you should understand: 

*People with deuteranomaly and protanomaly are collectively known as red-green colour blind and they generally have difficulty distinguishing between **reds, greens, browns and oranges** *

It's also important to note that this is the **most common** form of colourblindness, and affects about **8% of males**, and about **0.5% of females**. I hate to extrapolate statistics, but if we are looking at the csgo playerbase, looking at up to **1 million players a day**, this condition could affect up to **80,000 players**; not a lot in the grand scheme of things. Perhaps valve think that such a small amount is not worth compromising for. We really hope that this isn't the case, and even if it is, we have come up with a very simple compromise that really doesn't affect the appearance of the models, and **does not include disabling them outright**. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Possible solution**

We understand that it's simply not realistic to add an option to disable all custom models in csgo. We also think that changing the colour hues based on the map is not realistic because that calls for a big change in the overall colour scheme of the skin. 

So, we are simply asking for *very minor adjustment*. Before I tell you what the solution is, we need to understand *why* these models are causing a problem for colour blind players in the first place.

Take a look at the IDF model on Dust 2: https://gyazo.com/fe36db9c897b25ab363a1c6cd19bae91

As explained in the image, the model appears **difficult to identify** for red-green colourblind players such as my friend. However, due to the **black cloth** that surrounds the model's neck, and shadow under the beret, this black colour helps a **TON** in identify this player model due to the crucial contrast it creates. If it weren't for this bit of cloth, the IDF model would be a tough model to identify for colourblind players. This approach is **consistent** with other original models on csgo's release and is why you didn't see colourblind players complain about visibility in csgo **until now**. 

However, let's look at one of the washed out green models, also on dust 2 - take a look at this screenshot: https://gyazo.com/e690cb445d9928ce078c83dacb2adbf5

If you struggled to find him, imagine what it must be like for a red-green colourblind player. [here is the player if you couldn't find him](https://gyazo.com/5897287c8c5ee0beeb3331d5ebf2e02e)

To resolve this issue, I added a very similar **black contrasting cloth texture** to the player's neck and helmet area, to help the model be more visible: https://gyazo.com/cd1c893d966f3e7cabaca4d493aef85a (please forgive my awful paint skills, I would imagine someone working at valve would do a much better job). Just a very minor change like this would help colour blind players *immensely*.

I actually pulled a sneaky one on ya' (and myself).

While I was looking at this screenshot, I realised that **THERE'S ANOTHER HIDDEN MODEL IN THIS IMAGE** that even I didn't notice! This makes me wanna just cry :( https://gyazo.com/bf5785683bb04c1cc98d8ec6f553cc52 

Another example (Rickshaw model), also on dust 2: https://gyazo.com/b97c7f5008fe5d811a6192b9d7e87397

Us normal sighted folk can probably make him out fairly easily, but for my colourblind friend, **he could not locate the enemy in this image at all**. Let's add some kind of minor **identifier** and see how much of a difference it makes: https://gyazo.com/c2009004cbd1581fb898ef4b364c6fac Just a little bit of contrasting, strong solid black on the neck and the head area can make **so much difference**. It makes us really optimistic that this can be implemented, because it's such a **minor addition** and does not include outright adding a disable button for the models.

------------------------------

I hope you get the idea Reddit. What colourblind players desperately need is **very minor adjustments** to the models. We don't need to be radical, like changing the colour hue of the entire model, or allow disabling of them entirely. We just need very **basic**, **contrasting** pieces of cloth on the **head area of the model** to help better identify their location. 

On behalf of the colourblind playerbase, this is our last resort, I doubt this post will change anything. I just want to play cs with my friend again :'(.

fr574u,terror569,Things I‚Äôd appreciate.,"First things first I would love to start with saying that I really care about CSGO community and playing experience in general and have been playing this game for quite some while. 
Many of us know, that there are some things we would really appreciate, if being implemented into the game. This is just my thought process, but if anybody agrees with any of the stuff I‚Äôm about to write, feel free to leave a comment down below, whenever you agree or not. 

1. MM a.k.a. Match Making 
We seriously need new anti-cheat guys. It‚Äôs been said many, many times before and this on going problem has to stop. There are a lot of cheaters in this game, whether it‚Äôs deathmatch, casual or especially competitive ‚Äúwe are losing so I gotta turn it on‚Äù cheaters. I would welcome face.it like anti-cheat or at least improve, and I  really mean to improve the current one.
Other things that would be great to add to match making is either language filter, or something which would help us separate those who speak this or that language. I cannot count how many times I got into the team with Russians, couldn‚Äôt understand them because, well they didn‚Äôt speak English and were talking sh*t and almost kicked me just because. Now I‚Äôm not saying ALL Russians are like that, but most are. 
Now I know I can join other players to their lobby but when I‚Äôm with 3 or 4 friends of mine, there‚Äôs no way to join to someone so quickly, that the lobby wouldn‚Äôt be full before I invite all of them. 

3. Overwatch
We need more people to be doing these. We need people to be motivated with more than few level XP. We need some sort of feedback if ‚Äúthat‚Äù guy we reviewed actually got banned. We need some sort of trust factor which we can see, so more cases you review, more trusted detective you gonna become. I think people deserve a lot more for their time, reviewing cheaters in your game, than just few level XP. 

4. Demo replay improvement. 
Do I have to say more? 

5. Operations 
Well, operations and rewards for them. Operation Shattered Web cost what? ‚Ç¨15? And those rewards were... well not that great. 

Again, this is not a rant or anything, just things I would love to see in the game. Feel free to debate, I‚Äôm open to all your suggestions.

fr3icm,ThisIsSpy,VAC Ban Story,"Before I start, I want to say that I know that this won't help. I just want to share my story with others. I don't expect lord Gaben appear in front of me with his Ban Hammer and unban me instantly. I just want to share my story.

So, 4 days ago, I was VAC banned in CSGO, because I used the same phone number I have on my account to create other account where I cheated in CSGO. Of course, I didn't create any accounts just to cheat. And other people can't do it either, because even if you know my phone number, you also need to have physical access to my phone to confirm linking phone number to other account. I checked my SMS from Steam and the last one was from the end of January, when I returned my account because it was stolen. After I got VAC Ban, I immediately wrote post in VAC Discussion about the situation, and one user (I forgot the name, but it would be cool if he will see this post) suggested that, if my phone number is new, it might be recycled from someone else. So here's the theory: Some person creates Steam account using his phone number, after some time changes his number (maybe even changed his phone provider, or whatever it is called) but he doesn't link his older number to his account, his previous number gets recycled to me, I link this number to my account, then he uses cheats in CSGO (or maybe his account got stolen and sold on black market, and the person who bought it, usef cheats) and this crap results in VAC Ban. I know it sounds like Illuminaty confirmed theory and it is easier to win a lottery that to have this situation happen to you, but I don't have any other theories.

This is my story. I don't expect this to blow up and get 10 thousand upvotes (Im not a karmawhore). Any advice is appreciated.

This happens sometimes but it is always during the game, not when starting it, generally it only takes a minute to get ready but this time it crashed.

I download it thinking that it was a common patch as it used to be every few days, but when I go in, I look for a game and the game loads everything well. When the load is finished and the game is about to start, the game freezes on a black screen and you only hear what happens. This happens sometimes but it is always during the game, not when starting it, generally it only takes a minute to get ready but this time it crashed. Thinking that this is the problem, I restart the game to play normally, but it happens again. Try searching for a solution online and find one that involves a cdm command. I applied it and the game still didn't work, even now the menu character comes out with a horrible flickering in its textures like it's a television with no signal. I need help ASAP! I have already undone the command I had applied but it remains the same.

A good percentage of the games in low ranking there are hackers, only this week I dropped in 5 games with 3 to 5 hackers on the other team.

Hi gamers, I understand you are all very busy in your pursuit of fatty profit and high tier trades, but please take a moment to hear my speech.

Every single day, thousands if not millions of csgo players receive cases from drops and think to themselves, "" wow just some tradh "" and go about their day. It hurts my heart to see the neglect these poor poor cases face on a daily basis. If you are one of the people who have racked up many cases and dont know what to do with them, please send them in my direction. 

I truly love csgo cases and I am very good at taking care of them, I have some cases at the moment but i believe I can watch over all the cases and make them happy and cozy in their new home.

Thank you for getting this far in my soapbox, now all i ask is for you , the reader, to donate to me and help me pursue my dream.

However recently when searching the search numbers only reach 5/10 consistently. This has been happening for days now. It can go 5/10 for 5-10-15 times before a game is found. There is absolutely no way a 5 man is not accepting and then keeping the map in to not accept 15 times over. I legitimately believe there is a bot network of 5 that just searches office and doesn't accept it's fucked. There is now way valve punishes or bans these people for not accepting 20 games + and it needs to be addressed.,7,1585467356,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fr24id/csgo_is_being_search_griefed_is_there_anyway_the/,GlobalOffensive,1

fqzc4h,OrtusOrigin,Indecisiveness m,"As a silver elite, I feel a huge problem I encounter with both myself and my team is that we are very indecisive.

For example, the recent mirage match. 2 players were sweeping from mid to b, and 3 of us were rushing b. The enemy placed down a Molotov, then a smoke. At that whole time, we were just standing there or walking in circles, indecisive as to whether we push to mid and go from there, or we wait, since pushing mid has the risk of being fucked by sniper‚Äôs nest.

Another time during a and mid connector in mirage, my whole team was on mid. Both connector and nest was smoked. However, once again we didn‚Äôt know where to go. We were afraid to venture into the smoke, afraid to go b, and afraid that we were getting sniped from nest.

During this situations, what do I do? In general, how do I become more decisive? Is it just to say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and march through the smoke? Seems like what pros always doz",4,1585454028,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fqzc4h/indecisiveness_m/,GlobalOffensive,1

Is that ""Unfair"" VAC BAN can be a career killer?

What are you guys going to recommend just to keep safe from getting in situation like that. I already know that some of you will say ""Simply, don't sell it"", but let's say, I already did.

I'm not sure why it slows down like this because my computer should be able to run it really smoothly. However, my theory is that the CPU is throttling, since the frames dip when the CPU speed starts to get worse. I'm not an expert in this stuff so I wanted to see if anyone had any solutions.

fqohaf,csgoidiotman,green agent models still require adjustment or need to be made unusable on cache.,"I'm talking about the following skins with a predominately green hue. 

'Two Times' McCoy | USAF TACP 

Buckshot | NSWC SEAL

Markus Delrow | FBI HRT 

Seal Team 6 Soldier | NSWC SEAL

Additionally - Lt. Commander Ricksaw | NSWC remains a problem on almost every competitive map. His washed out colours blend with almost any surface, especially on Dust 2 and Mirage. 

These green skins have pretty much ruined Cache for me, which used to be my absolute favourite map. Some people use the green agent skins and UNKNOWINGLY give themselves an advantage. Usually it's about 1 second or half a second. That's an issue in counter strike. That half a second makes all the difference and by the time you know it, you're dead. I've seen some people purposefully abuse some particularly bad spots, and some of them admit it (even at global). 

I have 2 colourblind friends who have practically stopped playing the game because of this update which fucking breaks my heart :(

The rickshaw model is awful to play against in dust 2 and mirage. I played against a dude who was abusing the model at ramp on dust 2. (I can provide video if anyone wants). He did it about 5 times in a row and I still had to second guess where his head was it's truly that bad.

My proposal is that the valve:

Disables the green models on Cache

or 

Alter the green models when played on Cache

We all know that valve is never gonna remove the broken agent skins or allow a command, so I hope that this would be a decent compromise.",0,1585416625,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fqohaf/green_agent_models_still_require_adjustment_or/,GlobalOffensive,1
fqo6jh,slovakianpartizan,How do they decide whose map pick is going to be played first?,"Hello. So from a betting point of view, i wanted to ask if anyone here knows how do they pick whose map pick is going to be played first? Especially for ESL Pro League. Does it have anything to do with their ranking? I mean, is it possible to know before the match has started or do they decide before the game with playing a knife round or etc? I know it is not impossible to learn because some tipsters on twitter seems to be knowing whose map pick will be played first or second. For example, in TyLoo's last 3 matches, they always play their map pick first where as for 100 Thieves team, in their first match in EPL, in the Swole Patrol game the first map that was played was Swole Patrol's pick but in the 2nd match against Evil Geniuses, the first map was 100 Thieves' pick.

many times i was trying to catch him offguard by playing and off angle. standing a bit more to the side that you would normally expect. i got crouch-prefired (or at least looked like me to be the case) every now and then and i hade ZERO time to react. can somebody explain to me what this is? is this just the way online peeks work, and for him, he had more time to react to my sloppy angles?   


and its not just mapcore. in 5v5, i often just get deleted when i play an angle where i think ""oh noone wil expect this"" (like on the bycicle in pit) and i just get fetus deletus.

So my friends and I are MGE/MG2 average however we keep getting ranked with LEM and up for some reason. And these games come with what I can only describe as the most toxic and salty disgusting excuses for human beings I have come across. If you are not exactly where they expect you to be just once god help you. We end up muting almost every game because its almost every game we encounter these people. We are hopefully going to de-rank soon just to stay away from this terrible matchmaking and toxicity or uninstall the game for good.  


Does anyone know why we keep getting LEM and up? Our last game (I was MG2 and he was MGE) we were the lowest ranks and were ranked with Globals and Supremes.

fqmrr3,Mutazsam,Symptoms of my broken cs.,"Hello everyone and I hope you are all fine and having good time.

in this topic I'm gonna share my experience with cs go stuttering.

first of all I have to say that I have +6k hrs and have played cs go competitively for more than 3 years.

cs go stuttering made a lot for me. so I have put a lot of time in google and reddit trying to find a real fix for this Issue, I have read and tried every single tweak u could think about but nth worked for me, they were too much tweaks here and there and in different forums so it's hard to mention them all.

I've noticed lately that a lot of people suffering from this problem noticeably, but it seems like no one cares (Valve).

I have +200 fps in 95% of the situations in this game but I have a lot of problems, starting from stuttering going through heavy mouse movement and weird spray pattern when there's a fight, some micro freezes and weird spray pattern 

If u guys just use reddit search and put stutter as a keyword for your search u gonna find people with high end pcs suffering from the same problem and all of them can confirm that they might have a day with smooth game play with no problem and the next day everything is fked up.

what drives me crazy, this game runs in 300 fps and we still suffer from performance issues while other games runs on 100 and everything is fine.

should we upgrade our pcs every year to play a game released in 2012?

u guys can say anything but plz don't say this is a placebo or smth like this.

sorry for this long post but I have a feeling that I have to share this maybe this gonna change something specially after the last update.

Thank you.

PS: I could mention tweaks and posts I've read about the stuttering in comments with u.",10,1585411041,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fqmrr3/symptoms_of_my_broken_cs/,GlobalOffensive,1

All sounds were being played, esc showed my mouse and i could exit the game or do anything, but the screen was stuck on one frame. This sometimes happens once in first hour of playing, then doesn't until the next day and sometimes it just doesn't happen. I've tried verifying integrity, reinstalling, turning shader cache off in nvidia control panel etc.

I am using a laptop with an nvidia GPU for games and intel GPU for other purposes, running the game in 4x3 stretched on an external display, while using the other one for things such as discord.

Maybe the fact that people are not going out anymore is driving them crazy. Out of my last 10 matches there were three I had to mute at least 3 players on my team, because they just made sounds that I literally haven't heard since kindergarten fights while other teammates just flame for every tiny mistake everyone else makes or even before the match has even started. In other games there's usually one guy that throws so hard - teamflashes, turning around when he sees an enemy, ghosting, ... - that you can get 30+ kills in regulation and still lose. Or you just get demoralised, because you just get frustrated after 5 rounds of so much toxic behaviour that in a Marvel comic would give everyone superpowers.

I know none of this is new. CS has always been a toxic hell hole, but seriously at the moment it's so much worse than usual. And no, it's not level 2 face it players. It's also lvl8ish players that just throw a game, because they don't like the captain didn't ban Cache. Go outside and help your dad chop some wood.

most people who smurf do not smurf because the want to batter low skilled players, they do because they can not play with their friends otherwise.   


sure, there will still be dicks and shit, but i do think most smurf smurfs because of playing with friends.  


My idea: if adding alle 7 maps into scrimmage is not an option, give us 2 maps at all times, and rotate them every 2 hours or so, like the dangerzone maps. This way there will still be enough scrimmage players, while we also get to experience all maps.   
Also ppl will finaly have a safe environment to train the more uncommon maps like nuke or vertigo.",68,1585385596,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fqgi14/wee_need_more_scrimmage_maps_to_combat_smurfs/,GlobalOffensive,1

Thoughts on this? I don't dispute that there may be cheaters in online matches (though perhaps only at a lower level of pro play) or that yes there have been pros in the past and recent memory who have been caught cheating. But the tin foil hat wearers over there seem to believe that any even slightly suspicious clip warrants an immediate permanent ban being given to that player. The worst part is that when someone in the replies tries to give a rational explanation as to why the clip looks suspicious but is not an example of cheating they are berated with insults and treated as if they are less than human for believing that some pro players are actually legit.

fqed13,tolos,Is mm pairing correctly?,"I don't know if it's a recent valve change or what, but I've had a lot of bad matchmaking experience. Before I start, I want to make clear this isn't about teammates or toxic mm, my complaint is with the algorithm valve uses to match players together. I want to talk about my most recent four matches:

https://csgostats.gg/player/76561198025531195#/matches

For reference, at the start of the night I was MG1, my highest rank. All I want is to be paired with and against people close to my skill level. This is not happening.

[First match](https://csgostats.gg/match/7741411) of tonight we lose 9:16, which isn't that bad. Enemy top frag goes 31:13. Turns out, he was LE at one point. Ok, these things happen.  

[Second match](https://csgostats.gg/match/7742394), probably the worst pairing. We lose 10:16, again not that big a deal. But the current comp ranks that got paired: mg1, mge, mg2, mge, dmg vs mg2, mge, le, le, le. **what the fuck** how is that balanced. Two people on my team were previously LE. Opposite team had prior LEMx2, SMFCx2. 

[third match](https://csgostats.gg/match/7743001) we lose 3:16. The official ranks were pretty balanced IMO. But played against a global elite. And damn this guy was good. My teammates were super chill this match and we had fun. Probably my highlight was my scout headshot against that guy. 

Fourth match tonight, nothing special. mm working as intended (loss).

I visualized all the above:  https://imgur.com/a/VQnCL9M

Two other matches.

Fifth most recent match (2 days ago), nothing special. mm working as intended (win).

[Sixth most recent match](https://csgostats.gg/match/7600678) (4 days ago). Played against a guy supposedly my rank, with bad game sense and no utility usage, but absolutely got tier aim. Apparently LEM. Two other players were previously SMFC.

-----

So there we go. Four of my six most recent games have been absolutely terrible mm pairing. People on my team, and much more noticeably, people on the opposite team are no where near my experience level. This is frustrating for me and teammates when my team is better and I can't contribute the same as anyone else on the team. And it's frustrating playing against people 4 or more ranks higher when I lose nine out of ten aim duels.

I have [420 comp wins](https://csgostats.gg/player/76561198025531195#/matches) and I don't remember this ever being so bad. Is anyone else having this issue? Have I just got unlucky?",54,1585374478,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fqed13/is_mm_pairing_correctly/,GlobalOffensive,1

Ever since the quarantine, I get queued against hackers all the freaking time. Not the closet hackers that do a good job hiding it, I‚Äôm talking about those new account level 5 steam profiles that headshot you every time and always have the perfect timing. In mm, I went from DMG down to MG1 due to hackers and in Faceit, from Level 8 to Level 6 - also courtesy of new steam profiles who aim like NiKo. All of the blatant hackers we have encountered have not yet been banned and it has been two werks now, so I guess overwatch is not enough in relation to the growing player base. Game is literally unplayable.

I usually play on stretched without blackbars so I want to remove these

I've tried as much as I can inlcuding disabling GPU Scaling and having everything set to Preserve Aspect Ratio but i'm still getting these blackbars forced upon me

fqap5x,Ollisium,Appeal to CSGO Devs regarding latest patch/fix,"We really appreciate you fixing the Nvidia stutters which was a problem for alot of people but youve also created new problems with the last patch.

First off the changes to the shaders has ment some people have had alot less FPS. In a game where FPS is very important, i think its important to give people with lower end pc's a fair chance when they play.

With the latest patch, you obviously locked some shaders or change the peramiters. Meaning that everyones guns look shiny. I for one this its very distracting/annoying. I prefer things to look more matt. Is it possible you can give people an option to have their skins look how they did before please? I dont know if its possible to separate the weapon shaders and the map/model shaders but if it is, then please do it.

TLDR - The latest patch has fixed the Nvidia stutters but affected some peoples FPS for the worse and make everything look like its covered in oil.

Thankyou for hearing me out.",1,1585359396,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fqap5x/appeal_to_csgo_devs_regarding_latest_patchfix/,GlobalOffensive,1

I started playing this game with friends and I've only played for a couple of months (250 hours) so I'm currently in Gold 3 and I suck! But, I'm really starting to enjoy the strategic and skillful plays you can make, so I want to learn and improve and the best way to do that is to play!  
However, I'm so hesitant to soloq because if I get kicked and we lose then I believe I automatically demote and with this system (where you can't see your MMR) it's really hard to know when you will demote or promote (it also feels like it takes forever to promote).  


I've played LoL as my primary game for many years so I'm used to toxicity, but it baffles my mind how much worse *most* CS:GO players are (at least in gold).

fq8r4j,den_S_,Ridiculous Visual Glitches With the New Models/Patches,"In my 4 years of playing CS:GO on multiple setups, I have never seen a visual bug/glitch this bad. I was playing retakes which allow the new custom models, (also happens in Valve official servers) and saw this batshit insane texture glitch. I reinstalled, restarted Steam, fiddled with my settings; I tried everything and the new models (or its the patches) still create these insane textures that obscure my view and are just incredibly distracting. They remain on dead bodies and move with the player, so I know it's something to do with the models. Also I only have access to a very weak PC at the moment so I only get playable frames with every setting on the lowest value and with an 848x484 resolution stretched 16:9. Everyone on the servers I saw this glitch on said they never had the issue. If anyone can help me or has info on this it would be greatly appreciated!

But I heard nowadays every tournament and all tier1 players can use whatever jumpthrow bind they want? anyone has any source/info about this topic? does it also mean that every single bind is allowed - even if it makes more than 1 action per button?

These actions are by the same people who said no to 128 tick servers because ‚Äúmost of the player-base‚Äôs setups are not strong enough to handle it.‚Äù 

So now I can‚Äôt play 1v1 servers because the maps weren‚Äôt designed for shaders high setting and it looks like I‚Äôm being raised to heaven if I aim higher than head level, I can‚Äôt play on inferno/dust2/mirage because it‚Äôs too bright.

fq5i8q,Denssi,Help me out guys,"Nearly 2000 hours put into the game, peaked Supreme/FaceIt lvl 7

&amp;#x200B;

I've had this thing going on for as long as I can remember. I wouldn't call it a slump or anything, but I don't know how to counter it.

&amp;#x200B;

I had many periods in where I didn't play for a long time. After I came back, I rocked. I played so well game after game and I was super confident about myself out there in the server. Let's say I put 30 hours per week, this confidence/good vibe I have going on just completely falls off of me and I can feel it. I know for a fact my performance is at it's best, when everything is happening sort of automatically. When I don't focus on myself aiming, getting the kill, making certain moves or concentrating on my movement, I get the best results and win games. I often have the brain to play this game well; to ask flashes, to ask for baits and stuff, but all of this I just seem to forget every singe time.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I deal with this? Even though I'm putting effort on getting better and better by doing ffa and KZ for example, I still can't just leave these things out of my head after a certain period of playing CSGO regularly.",2,1585342448,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fq5i8q/help_me_out_guys/,GlobalOffensive,1

It only happens IN game, not in the menus. The screen will go black and the power light starts flashing on the monitor like it lost signal, but the sound will continue on - but only background music - no NEW sounds like player comms or gunshots. 

I can't alt tab or get into the task manager. All I can do it hold the power button and do a hard reset. 

Looking in the event viewer I don't see anything in there, but I'm not 100% what to look for. When I verify Local Files there is always 1-2 files it has to redo which causes a quick directx reinstall when I go to launch.

fpzz2k,kricetokiller,Headphones and footsteps,"Hi guys. I'm doing this post mainly to ask you if the fact that I don't hear the footsteps (I mean the spatial sound) is linked to my headphones (not even gaming headphones) or to other issues? I see people that even if they play with normal headphones, they know at least if the enemy is coming from the right or from the left, instead I hear only steps all over the map! On the bottom right of desktop If I press Right click on the audio it shows ""Spatial Sound"", howevere there is no way I can activate that. So, the main reason why I can't locate the footsteps are the headphones or the fact that I can't unlock ""Spatial Sound""? Just asking as noob, I know that I can perform better if I start recognizing footsteps, since I can also give more accurate info. 

Maybe someone can help me, I'll be really greatful.

fpzrz0,drewbird13,Finding the right sensitivity,"Ive been playing CSGO since 2014 and I'm still trying to find the right sensitivity. I know its extremely subjective and personal preference but I was hoping to get some tips on finding a comfortable range at least? 

For reference: 

-Usually play at 2.79sens 800DPI which i am told is really high.

-Currently playing at 1.2sens 800DPI, it feels like even walking is slowed and transferring is near impossible, trying to increment it up.

-Im usually the AWPer for the team, but I think a lower sens would help me become a better rifler, especially at distance.

-I have the XL steelseries mousepad and plenty of room on the desk, just feels unnatural to have so much arm movement and picking up the mouse.



Ultimately, I want to be comfortable at a lower sens to improve my rifling/tracking and also because I've noticed I overaim frequently and find myself zig zagging on opponents. Any and all help/advice/suggestions recommended!

From time to time I get wrong directional sound cues, for example, I'm in connector on mirage and I hear a guy zoom his awp in delpan (chair), I clear it, no one is there, going to rotate towards b through lower only to find him there sitting with an awp.
This happens occasionally in match not all the time. I haven't touched any sound commands through console, or ingame I always had it the way I set it up, even on my new headset that I got recently it is still happening, like 3,4x I will get a wrong sound cue throughout one match. It is only happening in csgo and it's infuriating. I have no clue what to do, and google didn't really help.

I've tried every almost single thing I can find on both Reddit and Steam forums to try and fix this problem to zero avail, considering reinstalling Windows at this point.

Tried messing with AMD drivers, graphics settings in the Radeon panel, Windows game settings turned off, compatibility settings messed with, tried Steam launch commands, uninstalled and reinstalled Steam, uninstalled and reinstalled CSGO multiple times and deleted the folder in /steamapps, even tried the beta build with the shader fixes and nothings working.

When I first build my PC a few months ago, I tested CSGO and it ran perfectly, including Dust 2. Anyone have any idea what the problem could be?

If teammate has been afk once 30 seconds of a new round have passed, they are then like bots in the sense that any dead teammate can hit E and control them. Afk 30 seconds, you can then be controlled by teammates as if you were a bot.

Okay since they bumped the prize pool why not add more teams in the Major? maybe like another 16 or 8 challengers in the Major? I mean it can be interesting and a probably a good reason to do it so since the second Major was canceled this 2020 and more teams has a chance maybe to win a Major maybe I don't know I mean yeah again this is just a dumb idea that came up from my head and yea maybe tournament organizers might have some troubles and handling for it and other stuff to handle that many teams to enter the Major but then again it can be interesting I don't know for me its just dumb just wanna share it with ya'll to know whats your guys opinion on this cause I don't have many friends that plays csgo.

fpx45y,eckeroth,Logitech G pro feels weird? Found a fix,"So ive been playing with the g pro for a while, and a week ago it started to feel weird. Like i wasnt hitting my shots. So i cleaned my mousepad as i thought that was the problem. It wasnt the weird feeling didnt go away. So i reinstalled Logitech gaming software without any luck. I even went that far to buy a NEW g pro mouse yesterday and the weird feeling was still there. 

I started reseaching online and i did find a fix!

So if you have the g pro wireless mouse and it isnt feeling like it used to. 

Here's the fix.

you need to locate the profile settings and change one line.

 C:\\users\\(your user name)\\AppData\\Local\\Logitech\\Logitech Gaming Software\\Profiles

in the XML file you need to find this section:

    &lt;pointer devicemodel=""Logitech.Gaming.Mouse.GPro""&gt;
            &lt;mode shiftstate=""1""&gt;
              &lt;reportrate rate=""1000""/&gt;
              &lt;powermode value=""2""/&gt;
              &lt;dpitable shiftindex=""0"" syncxy=""1"" defaultindex=""0""&gt;
                &lt;dpi enabled=""1"" x=""400"" y=""400""/&gt;
                &lt;dpi enabled=""1"" x=""800"" y=""800""/&gt;
              &lt;/dpitable&gt;
              &lt;movement  speed=""-1"" acceleration=""0""/&gt; --- This line is going to be replaced
            &lt;/mode&gt;
          &lt;/pointer&gt;
        &lt;/pointers&gt;
    
    Find that line and replace it with this 
    
    &lt;movement accelerationscheme=""none"" accelerationprofile=""-1"" speed=""-1"" acceleration=""0""/&gt;

fpug9b,Givemeajackson,"i played a ton of DOOM 2016 in preparation for eternal recently, and i think it improved my CS:GO game.","so, there's lockdown in my country, and i recently got a new predator x34 monitor, so i started to replay doom 2016, going into it with the expectation that it might wreck my CS aim for a while. yesterday i hopped back into CS (i'm LEM and have been for ages at this point) and played really damn well, and rather differently from how i normally play. here's the things that i found:

1. Relaxation: CS is slow. so, so very slow. most of the time nothing is happening on your screen, you're walking somewhere checking angles or standing somewhere holding angles. i have realized i reacted to this by cramping up in anticipation. both physically and mentally. in doom, there's constant action. you're flying through the air, there's 47 different demons all around you, you're running out of ammo and or health. but that is the norm. you can't sit there cramped up for 6 hours of non-stop flicking, running and jumping. i found that in my recent couple of games, i had a lighter grip on the mouse and i was a lot less nervous.
2. movement: of course the movement in these games is extremely different. but they both serve the same purpose: not getting hit. i think one of my biggest flaws as a CS player is that i oftend tend to rely on my ability to outaim my opponents while standing still. if i'm put in a tough spot, i tend to stand still and try to hit the shot, which doesn't work if your opponent is as good at aiming as you are. i found that this didn't happen as much in the last couple of games. it felt normal to move during fights, and my aim and movement seemed to be more in sync than usual
3. trigger reluctance: this one is kinda hard to describe, but it's a problem i have mainly with pistols, and especially the deagle. i'm good at burst firing and spraying in CS, and very often the first shot of either a spray or a burst is a headshot. so my aim is pretty much on point. but for some reason when i'm using a pistol, i found that i lock up and second guess whether my aim was correct, cause i think i have to make the shot count and can't follow up quickly with the next. i hesitate to pull the trigger and try to micro-correct my aim after my first instinct, and that usually ends in me either missing the shot or not getting to shoot cause the opponent has already killed me. none of this is conscious, it's a few miliseconds and a few pixels, but it costs me duels. in the last couple of games that was gone, i trusted in my my aim without hesitation and more often than not hit the shot i wanted to hit.
4. vertical aim: CS is flat. most duels happen on level ground, and most aim pracitce happens on level ground. doom is very different in this regard, you have to aim absolutely everywhere. i found that i was more comfortable in duels where there was an elevation difference, like in apps on inferno or apps on mirage

i don't know whether i just absolutely nailed my sens in doom, but i don't think my CS muscle memory took a hit. i had a ton of fun in doom, and it was a steep learning curve. i expected my CS aim to translate much better into it, but you have to play with a completely different mindset, and i was in for a rough start on nightmare difficulty until i adapted to the vastly different pace.

all in all i'd say that if you can find the time, playing other shooters might help you break out of bad habits you have in CS:GO, and maybe show you where your weaknesses might be. it won't permanently mess up your CS muscle memory. i hope i can retain this relaxed attitude and posture in my CS game going forwards, and i hope i can recognize when i'm cramping up and counteract it.",50,1585303906,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fpug9b/i_played_a_ton_of_doom_2016_in_preparation_for/,GlobalOffensive,1

fpsdec,Wintomallo,Prime Matchmaking is broken,"I have ~600 hours and many of my friends have &gt;1200 hours. We all have prime. We all paid for the game. Recently matchmaking has been terrible. We have been consistently queued with one or more people who don‚Äôt have prime and have no more than 50 hours in game. It‚Äôs absurd.

3 games ago. We get paired with a Russian dude who is level 36. He has a prime account. We are playing against mg1s and novas. He gets 4 kills the whole game. We lose. Not good but nothing to be pissed over. We were however completely confused by his time in game.

2 games ago. We play another game on mirage this time. 3 people on the enemy team have 10 year coins one has a 2018 and 2019 service medal and their fifth doesn‚Äôt have prime. Our fifth doesn‚Äôt have prime either. We lose no big deal but we are all annoyed.

Last game we get put on dust two. (By now only two of us are queuing) four of the players on our team (including my friend an I) have 2020 service medals. Their team has 3 2020 a 2019 service medal and a 5 year coin. Our fifth man is level 9 and is not prime. He had 29 hours in the game. He couldn‚Äôt have been playing for over a week. He asked what CAT was on dust two. (At least he‚Äôs trying to learn.) He had ridiculous lag and did jack nothing. This is what really pissed me off. I shouldn‚Äôt be put in a spot where kicking my teammate is going to be better for the team than actually having that teammate (I didn‚Äôt kick him and spoiler alert: we lost)

It‚Äôs not fun to be matched with people who lag too much to play the game, have less than a tenth of your hours, don‚Äôt know call outs, can‚Äôt get kills, don‚Äôt even have prime matchmaking, and it‚Äôs not even fun for the person playing as they get obliterated because they have no experience. I didn‚Äôt pay for this game and put hundreds of hours into this game (I know it‚Äôs a lot less than many of yours but still) to be queued with people that don‚Äôt know how to crouch jump. Fix prime matchmaking.

I have also consistently had this problem in wingman. The people my brother and I play against don‚Äôt have prime. (That‚Äôs not a huge deal though)

I mainly play CS:GO where you can easily tell if there's lag or not. So I have this issue with my monitor where everything on my screen feels so delayed and my mouse feels so heavy and not crips. I at first thought it was my old pc that was slowly dying, but aboit 2 weeks ago I built a new computer and the issue still hasn't gone away. Now I'm certain it's an issue in the monitor. The weird thing is when I turn off my monitor the lag sometimes disappears but not completely. I can also get rid of it sometimes by alt tabbing and switching profiles on the monitor itself. Can someone explain to me what the hell is wrong with it?

fpltwg,greendevil32,My verdicts as an Overwatch Investigator are irrelevant,"When players can make new accounts in 5 minutes, play 2-3 deathmatch games, and then be able to queue for Ranked Matchmaking right after being banned, it is absolutely infuriating to someone like me who is a fervent Overwatcher. Sure, you could claim that the simple threat of getting banned is created with the implementation of Overwatch; but, my verdicts are irrelevant when they can be so easily circumvented.

&amp;#x200B;

A player after being banned can be right back to hacking in matchmaking in just 30 minutes. When you compare that to the time it takes to actually convict a player (nobody knows, but probably \~10 investigators per case?) multiplied by about 10 minutes to view the case. That's 100 minutes of time spent collectively to ""ban"" an account. The ""ban"" i'm referring to might as well be a 30-minute temporary ban from playing CS:GO since it's so god damn easy to circumvent.

&amp;#x200B;

I know VAC has historically not been as intrusive on systems as other AC's like EAC or Battleye, but would it really be too intrusive to grab a few hardware identifiers such as those from the MOBO and the CPU? My worry is that players like myself are going to realize that Overwatch really is a lost cause in a F2P game, ESPECIALLY with such lax requirements to enter ranked matchmaking. The CS ranked requirement is crazy easy compared to other games like R6S.

&amp;#x200B;

Please Valve, I know you browse this subreddit. I have been a loyal customer for years and years. I fully support Valve products and want them to succeed. Please give us a solid reason to truly believe that Overwatch is making a difference in the community, because right now, we're spending \~100 minutes of collective work to temporarily ban someone for 30 minutes.

fpkj1f,Cal9_,Feel no difference between 60 and 240 hz ?,"Hi, I promise this is a serious post its not a shitpost

I've played on a trash 60hz monitor for the past 5 years and recently for my birthday I got a 240hz monitor

However my game in Cs feels pretty much the same, not even a slightly noticeable difference negative OR positive, no change whatsoever

I'm still gonna keep my monitor but i thought the game would play differently somehow after all the threads ive read on upgrading from 60 to 144 over the years

Personally i dont feel any difference....is there any way to make sure and check that my monitor is displaying at 240? idk if that makes any sense

and just to clarify i have 300+ fps in game",25,1585259639,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fpkj1f/feel_no_difference_between_60_and_240_hz/,GlobalOffensive,1

 South America has only one server, what's up with that?.

Here is the problem, playing with Brazilians is difficult because we all speak Spanish except them so we don't understand very well what they're saying.

**My suggestion is:**  
Create a simple system (a box) where you click your language (Spanish/Portuguese) and then you play with the people that chose the same option.

**Benefits:**  
The team speaks the same language so communication is better and games are more enjoyable.

I think that Europe has the same problem.",5,1585258603,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fpk84r/language_matchmaking_system/,GlobalOffensive,0

fpjfns,sploog_cruise,2019 was a record breaking year for VAC,"**Recent Valve data reports have shown that Valve banned 200% more cheaters in 2019**


A record breaking 4 cheaters were banned before influencing competitive games in 2019


Usually the anti cheat required up to 50 games and hundreds of reports to figure out that a new account with 8+ KD and 100% winratio and headshot ratio over 10 games in matches where most of the opposite players leave, while spamming links to illegal cheat websites every 2 seconds in chat is in anyway, a suspicious activity. 

But thanks to the hard work of the anti cheat developers of valve at least 4 players have confirmed to be banned throughout 2019 before ruining more than 3 games. 

Gabe Newell spoke on the astounding results: ""it can be very difficult to detect cheaters, how do we make a system that is able to intepret that a 100% headshot and over 90% accuracy over 50 games, could perhaps be signs of cheater, and not just someone having a good day? We will continue t improve our anti cheat, after all, the quality of and integrity of games is of uttermost importance to us and Im proud of the results""  

Say what you want, but VAC is making the position of cheaters a VACant one

I don't know exactly when this started occurring, but everytime I want to enable Instant Replay or Start Recording with Shadowplay, it switches on for a second, but instantly switches off again.   


I have tried:

* Reinstalling Graphics driver (Reinstall not Update)
* Reinstalling CSGO
* Reinstalling GeForce Exprierience
* Testing out all sorts of Options in Shadowplay.
* I reinstalled Windows 10 not long ago, so there wont be a problem with that. Everything worked fine after that. 

Are any of you expieriencing the same issue? Has anyone had the same issue and managed to solve it?   


I have searched online, but all of the search results could not really help me

Q2: All crosshair commands used in CS and informations about it are very vague on Using Decimal values... For example I want to use cl_crosshairsize 3.75 and cl_crosshairthickness -2.35 sth of this nature... How is it not possible and why can we not use it?

fpezxo,tribute2power,CS GO Server Protocol TCP/UDP Proxy,"Hey guys.

Due to the situation with my ISP, I need to use a proxy service to have my Server being available to the public. I am currently using HAProxy and it works well with my Minecraft Server that uses TCP. The issue I've run into is that my Counterstrike server currently runs on UDP. According to the [tutorial guideline](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-counter-strike-global-offensive-server-on-centos-7), I followed and multiple forum posts I online, it was recommended to open the firewall for both UDP and TCP on Port 27015. Therefore I wondered if it is possible to force the csgo server to run on TCP, as UDP is not supported by HAProxy.If you are using a proxy for csgo as well and use another service than HAProxy (like [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) for example), I'd love to hear more about the way you set it up!

fpeb4u,PositiveStylesy,This stutter is unbearable.,"How is this not being adressed? All they send out is a tweet telling you to close chrome, followed by new weapon stickers for Alyx. 

I shouldn't have to fucking worry about FPS issues on a high end PC. It doesn't make sense.Not for a game with  a million players playing it as I write this.  Literally no other game right now has stutter issues like CS does at the moment. I'm genuinely having the most fun I've had in my 5.2k hours played and I feel like I'm improving a lot but this stutter is just terrible. Maybe it's placebo, because it only seems to happen at the worst fucking time possible EVERYTIME. ( Right when I see someone pop into my screen and start shooting )

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any fixes? Literally anything I can do besides turning every single thing besides CS off?

fpcm48,Sinocci,Reddit community servers (Let`s discuss about it),"Good morning, good afternoon, good night... Whatever the case.

This  idea has bottered me for a while, but (for unfortunate reasons) finally  I have the time to discuss the viability of it and, if so, start this  endeavor.

[r/Globaloffensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globaloffensive/) is a huge community: (~~1 million players discussing if someone would die in a match between ENCE vs MIBR~~)  players discuss, share their thoughts and opinions and, of course, lurk  around here. I probably spend more of my time here then in the game  itself (we grow up and obligations steals our game time).

Despite  all the interaction around here, we still don't have servers for the  members of this community. Wouldn't be awesome to play among those who  spend time learning smokes and training their aim? Or, for those who  don't have the time, to just play an average friendly game among  community members? How cool would be someone call strats they just saw  in EPL/Flashpoint and the team actually listening to them. Imagine in  the middle of the games to talk about last night game between our  favorite teams?

The  last few days there was so many cheaters in matchmaking that I had to  go to a third party server (GamersClub here in Brasil). And this made me  remember the idea for Reddit servers.

Here are the main points I thought about so far (and this is something to build up in months, not days or weeks):

\- Each region would need to have it's own servers, for obvious reasons (ping);

\-  In the beginning we could maintain the servers based on donations. I  bet we have more than enough players willing to help and have the  financial conditions to do so (servers would not be behind a paywall, I  understand that not everyone has the money to pay for it). We could also reach some server providers for some help, it\`s amazing what we can get TALKING to people;

\-  If it works, it would probably be one of the biggest servers outside MM  (I'm just guessing at this point, but I can do some research and  gather/validate data later on). With enough people we could have  sponsors to pay for the servers later on;

\-  It would never have some kind of premium. The idea here is to get  people close, to built a tool so people can get together and have fun.  Premiums split the community and goes on the opposite way, this is not a  business proposal!

\-  Accounts could be linked to Reddit. We could talk to Reddit admins to  build something like an exclusive Reddit login system with high enough  karma to play on the servers. It could dissuade/limit hacking in the  servers (before anyone says it could never be done, and reddit employees  are too important to help us remember: they are normal people too, they  have hobbies and maybe someone love counter strike too. With  communication we can achieve a lot of things!);

\-  We could have at least 1 rotating map made by the community, maybe  there would be some gem around here that ends up so popular that is  featured in a major. Or even create our own community events, something  like a operation next time we are left with 2+ years without anything  different to do (I\`m going really far now, let me scale back my thoughts  and stop it here).

Now, the difficult/technical part:

\- We need an ranking system and be able to make it work properly;

\- Additionally, we also need a system to match people with the same ranking (some may call it a matchmaking system);

\- An anti-cheat (?)

...

There are a lot to talk about, but the first thing we have to achieve is adoption of the idea. So here goes my proposition:

fpc4bz,randomnamewhatevs,Tyloo Earnings,"So, the casters on FaZe vs TYLOO mentioned something interesting, in that TYLOO, despite not being a top 20 team (most of the time), actually is pretty high up in terms of prize money by virtue of domestic tournaments with high prize money.

I was curious, so I looked it up, and it turns out that TYLOO has earned more prize money than either ENCE, Vitality, or MIBR (keep in mind [the site](https://www.esportsearnings.com/games/245-counter-strike-global-offensive/top-teams) tracks the prize money per org, not team core, so the MIBR core's earnings under SK and Luminosity Gaming are not counted under MIBR). Nonetheless, the fact that a team that has never ranked higher than 10, and had no memorable major success, earned more prize money than major finalists and once-top2 team ENCE, Vitality (also top 2 at one point) and MIBR (while they haven't been as good under this org as they were in 2017, they were ranked #4 in the world at one point, and were top 10 for a solid year or so).

I wonder how much this has held back TYLOO from attempting to breach the upper echelons of CS GO. To what extent have they been tempted to just stick around China and fight Vici Gaming (and MVP.PK, but they aren't as good) over the relatively large prize pools, rather than try to fight their way through e.g. Dreamhack Opens to qualify for Dreamhack Masters, and climb the rankings enough to consistently get invites? Because at it stands I feel like they've basically been doing just that - play domestic tournaments, qualify for majors,  and very rarely venture out to global tournament territory beyond that, and generally getting blown out at those events ([Never reached a Final](https://www.hltv.org/stats/teams/events/4863/TYLOO?matchType=BigEvents) at a Big Event, as defined by HLTV).

fp96wn,AlainVanDamn,New Trust Factor Idea,"With the lockdown as a result of the coronavirus the CSGO playerbase is raising day by day. Some friends and I started to play a lot more too. In a lot of games we get frustrated by our teammates who don't use a mic, don't speak English or just keep me telling how they fucked my mom. After a while it just ruins competitive. It's always a gamble if you're going to have helpful teammates or just some trolls who aren't willing to co√∂perate. 

Right now, toxic people aren't getting punish in any way. So I think it would be nice if Valve would expand their 'commend system' and their trust factor. Players should be able to commend teammates during or after a game (kind of like LoL). For example, you could be able to check some boxes like:

""this player doesn't use a mic"" 

""this player is toxic""

""this player was helpful""

""this player was friendly"".

And then this data should be used to match players better. The friendlier you are the friendlier teammates you get. And the toxic players would end up with toxic teammates. I think this would lead to a better competitive experience for most of the playerbase. And meanwhile toxic players get punished for their negative attitude.",16,1585218230,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fp96wn/new_trust_factor_idea/,GlobalOffensive,1

I remember watching their major run live, and to me they were the real winners man, taking down all these big boys while being the underdogs, it was magical

I remember going to Blast Pro Series S√£o Paulo, my first ever big cs event. MiBR got dicked by the other teams and while that made me re-consider the price of the bus to SP,  the price of the ticket, etc. ENCE was still there baby. Sadly, they went out at 3rd place, and then we had that sweet clash of titans (astralis vs liquid) They demolished MiBR again in the pro standoff and that was when I noticed they were my favorite team. I always enjoyed seeing allu play and then out of nowhere he's in the top 2 team? Shit, count me in

I started considering buying an ENCE jersey even tho the shipping to Brazil would be absolutely ridiculous, anything for daddy Allu

I still think of how much they fucked up. Literally one of the top 3 worst roster moves in the game. Telling your IGL to fuck off and bam you're below his team in the ratings

I don't hace ENCE nowadays but... I really don't have the passion that I had.

No more EZ4ENCE
No more going A but then going B

fp76ui,leesheen,New player CSGO and keep getting kicked in Comp,"Hi,

I've been playing CSGO for about 60 hours pretty much only casual. All my friends play competitive and they encouraged me to give it a try. My first game went great, I was at the top of my team and ended the game at like 30/2...How I managed that, I have no idea. The next game I got matched with about 4 people who were ranked already and got kicked because I started running during one round. Alright, I get it. I probably shouldn't have done that, but I panicked and didn't think I would get kicked for it. The next few games after that I didn't do horrible, but not terribly well either, and still got kicked.

How am I supposed to get to the correct skill level if no one lets me finish the game? I've been doing a lot of research and practicing before going into a game. I've heard that playing with another person helps, but all my friends are too high in rank to play with me.

TLDR; Can never finish a game because I get kicked. What is the best way to get to games where other people are at the same level as me?",189,1585207013,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fp76ui/new_player_csgo_and_keep_getting_kicked_in_comp/,GlobalOffensive,1

I remember few years ago when I was younger I was playing like all the time with my friend, we were grinding a lot and it was fun. I remember i had like 1000 games, but my friend had less like 700 games in faceit, and now when I'm looking at faceit I have 1800 games and my friend... 3100 games. Sometimes I tried a bit diffrent games, but I just play month and I'm bored. I took many breaks, sometimes month and sometimes few months and then I was playing and having fun. But last couple of months it's worst i ever had... I feel I should just quit games forever. I'm changing my sensitivity all the time, i don't want to even improve anymore. But it makes me sad, because i was loving cs, but now i hate it and makes me so angry. I don't know... Maybe I should find new hobby or something... i dont know :/

They either say ""we wanna win, cry more noob"" or they dont say anything. It's disruptive behavior isn't it? Intentionally trying to ruin the game for everyone on the enemy team.

I understand that there sometimes are duo-queues where either both cheat or only one cheat, and they don't kick each other of course. But that doesnt matter. 

If there could be some way for Overwatchers to see the  votekick boxes and see who voted yes, and at the same time see who is queued together, there would be a decline in cheaters because they know their going to get kicked, because noone wants to get banned for griefing.

I don't wanna sound like I just played against a cheater and got really mad and ended up writing this. It's just a general suggestion.

fp0gg2,accountstolen1,It's no fun being a new player,"**TLDR:** The community is mostly unfriendly and playing isn't fun as a new player.

Hey guys,

I just want to share my short story about CS:GO. I played a lot of CS 1.6 like 15 years ago. Last week I started with CS:GO because of boredom during the Corona virus.
I like playing competitive games at my low skill rating. First problem is the horrendous cooldown time (21h) after two wins for the first 10 games. 45 minutes playtime, then one day cooldown...

But the cooldown time is only the smaller problem, the big problem is the ""community"". Most games aren't enjoyable at all. Teammates who kill you on purpose, random kicks, insults and so on. Or they expect that you understand Russian, that's not the case. I experienced that, but often teammates are affected too. The atmosphere is toxic as hell. Of course I'm not a good player, but it's not like that I'm useless in the game.

I know there are other games like LoL with a similar community, but it's not fun at all. There are few cases with nice mates, but mostly it's frustrating. Because a game should be fun, I'm out again after one week.

I hope with my naivety that some players will read this and behave a little better in the future.

Have a good day and stay healthy!",0,1585178014,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fp0gg2/its_no_fun_being_a_new_player/,GlobalOffensive,1

fowdne,FatYeet202,Why is the ranking system just dependent on wins and losses?,"I just deranked despite dropping 24-30 kills in The last 8 games I played. Why does my rank depend on luck and not me getting better?

I‚Äôve stayed the same two ranks for the past amost two years I‚Äôve played the game, despite me getting much better as a player. It‚Äôs like rank coincides with luck and not skill.

I‚Äôm a silver 2 right now after I deranked from silver 3 dropping a 30 bomb against a full queue and losing. I have almost 1000 hours in csgo and I‚Äôve queued up against nova‚Äôs and high silvers and top fragged, but I can‚Äôt seem to get my rank up because of bad luck with shit teammates.

People say that to get out of silver you just have to be good enough to carry every game, but I don‚Äôt know if I can carry harder! I throw smokes and flashes to set up my teammates, drop a 30 bomb every other game, and try to coordinate pushes and ct sides so my teammates don‚Äôt wander around cluelessly like a bunch of morons.

Why does rank depend on the skill of your teammates, in a game where unless you have friends that consistently queue up with you, you‚Äôre solo queuing?

Tl;dr I‚Äôm mad cuz bad, and haven‚Äôt ranked up despite getting far better at the game.",5,1585164202,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fowdne/why_is_the_ranking_system_just_dependent_on_wins/,GlobalOffensive,1

fow8wn,WCKDFX,This is a TEAM GAME!,"Alright people, i'm going to try to keep this a brief as possible. I've gotten back into the game (CSGO) after not playing for about 4-5 years, and I notice a lot of people playing this as a solo game. A lot more than I've ever seen before.

Disclaimer:  
I've never been, am not, and (fnatic hit me up &lt;3) never will be a pro. But I do have a good understanding of this game.

I'm going to try to explain from my point of view, what are the 2 most essential skills in CS(GO) that are missing these days.

This is not meant for teams who play their top country, but it is intended for all people who played CS for less than 1-5 years.

1. Communication  
2. Game sense

**Communitation:**  
This is what is most lacking in current day CS. A lot of people communicate, but don't know how to do so properly. I see people willing to try their hardest when it comes to communicating, but not knowing how to, and I see a lot of people aiming superhard, but when it comes to communicating all of a sudden they don't feel the need to do so. 

*How to properly communicate you ask me?*

\- Call what you see when alive (2 pushing long, they smoked cross)  
\- Call what you see at the moment when you die (1 pushing short, awp)  
**- SHUT THE \*\*\*\* UP WHEN YOUR DEAD (...)**  
\- If you aim to be ingame leader, try to call at beginning of round what you expect the enemy team to do, and what your team should do.

The amount of times that I've died because either people didn't give info, or because they shouted in my \*\*\*\*\*\*\* ear when I was trying to listen for steps somewhere, is unbelievable.

But what if an enemy is killed somewhere, what should I do?  


**Game sense:**  
Try to understand how this game works. Have a mental map of where your enemies play. Try to understand what people's first instincts are, and try to counter that. Be part of your team. 

Let's take an example:  
D2: Terrorist-side:  
Someone bought an AWP on your team. 1 guy has SG, 2 guys have AK. You haven't bought. 

*What do you do?*  
You talk with your team first to decide on what this round's plan is.

You buy AK (most likely). You know that 1 is in B, 1 on mid, 2 on long and 1 short. Given this information you try to get the pick somewhere on the map. 

*You get the pick on  short.* 

Knowing how your enemy team plays, you could now make a decision (with your team) on where to push, and how. What is the logical next step? 

**What is the logical next step?**   
So there is now 2 long, 1 mid, 1B.

The most logical option for the enemy team is to have one of their long players rotate back to A site/short.

That means your team can now step on pushing somewhere. Smoke mid-to-b? Push long, get frag, smoke cross? Have your teammate in tunnel fake B with smoke and 2 flashes and wait for A to rotate?

In the end I feel that communication is the most important aspect of this game, and it should be worked on by a lot of people. Please at all times keep respect for your teammates, and try to always give positive criticism towards teammates!

I even made an entire new steam profile and the trust factor was red on that from the start.

I haven't cheated so dont assume i have been banned on another profile as thats not the case. It was fine one game and the very next game it went red and now it will not improve. I spent 2 days doing overwatches and still no improvement.

Due to a series of unfortunate events I have quite some time at hand to play CS:GO again. However, the game keeps crashing. The game just closes itself at random points. Pretty much instantly after joining any DM server, randomly when I play competitive (\~every 30 seconds).

He has more than 5000 hours on CS:GO, and single handedly reached the rank of MGE (he rarely uses voice chat, and always plays solo q) so I thought that's and amazing achievement for the man his age.  
Being that we are from Serbia, I wonder how we might get him into one of those teams because I only saw German, Swedish, Finnish and USA teams.  
If there's anyone in this subreddit that knows anything about the propositions of registration, it would be a great help for us because CS is the only game he ever plays and he is really passionate about it.

fop5o4,TheBigPate,"Because of the inefficiency of VAC; Guys, do more overwatch cases, please.","So I played against this guy that was pretty suspicious whole game, and when the score was 14-14, he just went full S1mple. (Clip in a comments)

Now, I guess its possible that he is legit, but to me this seems pretty unlikely. However, IF he is cheating, this match happened around 50days ago, and guy is still not banned (no game ban nor VAC). So it makes me think, for how long can you actually cheat in this game, until you get banned? I know valve wants to do the bans in waves, so cheaters would have less of a clue where they went wrong, but at the same time it seems stupid to me that guys like these are left to ruin so many games for so many people.
So the point of this post is: Guys, do more overwatch cases, that's the least we can do to save this game from the evil.",6,1585137940,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fop5o4/because_of_the_inefficiency_of_vac_guys_do_more/,GlobalOffensive,1

foehbr,ImThour,What Source 2 Port mean for CS:GO,"As you all know, CS:GO is going to be ported to Source 2 (Not sure if it will be complete or just required components like it happened with Panorama UI), I tried to find out what will be the advantage of Source 2 for playerbase. Here are some of the features of the Source 2 which might be coming in the game.

#Features of Source 2:

1. **Completely rebuilt Hammer level editor, featuring modern polygon mesh editing tools:** This will help all the map developers to optimize and create better maps with extended limits. This might help in performance issues and better visuals.

2. **Engine capable of rendering highly complex and well detailed scenes with minimal FPS drops:** This surely means that the FPS will be much better in the game with complex map.

3. **64-bit support alongside Vulkan:** Compared to OpenGL and Direct3D, Vulkan is intended to offer higher performance and more balanced CPU/GPU usage.

4. **Better multi-core rendering and more efficient 3D rendering:** Multicore rendering allows the game to utilise more than one CPU core. As CS:GO is more CPU Intensive, it will boost the overall game performance with latest CPUs coming in the market. 

5. **Lower latency and more responsive input:** Won't make a major effect as the input lag is already minimal in CS:GO however this might make it to absolute zero and yes, better latency as well.

6. **Increased performance limit to take advantage of higher end hardware:** Whenever your system is an overkill, the CPU/GPU utilization remain normal. This might help to get those extra frames on a High End PC with more cores &amp; threads.

7. **Improved audio and voice processing:** CS:GO has some of the best in-game audio system and I think this will make it even more better. 

8. **New in-house physics engine, Rubikon:** Not sure if the overall game physics will be changed in CS:GO but this might make a huge change in the overall gameplay and movement.

Overall, Source 2 in CS:GO will directly impact on the performance of the game for both Low End and High End PC users.

This is my Stattrak Five Seven with 4 stickers on it which value around 1400 $.

 Fnatic (Holo) | Katowice 2014 - 601 euro

Fnatic (Holo) | Katowice 2015 - 49 euro

Fnatic (Holo) | DreamHack 2014 - 36 euro

I was thinking maybe is there a fan who would like to have this on his collection and would want to give a knife which values around 250-300 euro.

There you can see some ppl doing amazing sprays and killing you on sight with amazingly sharp aim full auto AK hs. I told a friend of mine about this server and how good some people spray there and he told me sometimes it's just cheaters trying to adjust their cheats or no recoil scripts to seem believable for legit cheating in competitive.

foanu1,Mad_Z,Rio Major Spot Retention - Zywoo Jail &amp; Other Potential Problems,"With the Rio Major getting moved to November, this means there will be a 444 day gap between the Berlin Major &amp; Rio. While the circumstances are obviously extenuating, it seems as though this could cause big problems for some teams looking to retain their spots in the Legends &amp; Challengers stages.

&amp;#x200B;

As we know, teams must maintain 3 out of the 5 players from the previous major to retain their spot in the next major. We are still 7 and a half months out from Rio, and there are multiple teams who have already made their 2 changes. I haven't seen this mentioned elsewhere, so I thought it was worth starting a discussion on this.

&amp;#x200B;

The most obvious issue is with **Vitality**'s roster. Alex &amp; NBK have both been replaced, meaning if any of Zywoo, RpK, or apEX leave, Vitality will lose legend status. Going off of what Zywoo's mom said ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fnkn2a/nel\_zywoos\_mom\_directly\_talked\_to\_xtqzzz\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fnkn2a/nel_zywoos_mom_directly_talked_to_xtqzzz_on/) ), he's pretty unhappy with the team. I'm sure Vitality wants to keep Zywoo anyway, but with the major spot in jeopardy, I can't see any scenario where they let another team buy him out.

&amp;#x200B;

There are 5 other teams who also have only 3 out of their 5 members from the Berlin major:

&amp;#x200B;

Unless **Mibr** wants to play with Zews again, the core of FalleN, fer, &amp; taco can't change unless they want to forfeit their challenger spot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**FaZe** must retain the core of rain, NiKo, and olofmeister if they want to keep their challenger spot.

&amp;#x200B;

**G2** must retain the core of kennyS, jackz, and amanek if they want to keep their challenger spot.

&amp;#x200B;

**North** must retain the core of aizy, Kjaerbye, and gade if they want to keep their challenger spot.

&amp;#x200B;

**c0ntact** must retain the core of Letn1, Espiranto, and ottoNd if their want to keep their challenger spot.

&amp;#x200B;

It will be interesting to see if an exception will be made, or if any teams choose to forfeit their spot in favor of the roster's long term competitive health. With 230 days to go, and no guarantee that the Major won't be postponed for even longer, it is a shame to think that this policy could cause half a dozen teams to be stuck with a stale roster.",10,1585075796,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/foanu1/rio_major_spot_retention_zywoo_jail_other/,GlobalOffensive,1

fo93uk,RGCFrostbite,Is CSGO Matchmaking more inbalanced now compared to 2-3 years ago?,"For context I'm currently Faceit Level 6/7 hovering up and down between those - I know that's not impressive and that's not the point. I'm gold nova 1 in MM, and MM feels incredibly harder than level 7 Faceit. In MM people are consistently either on my team or the other team dropping 30-40 kills. My last 5 Games are: 10-1 FFW 16-11 loss(Enemy top frag 33 ally top frag 30, noone else above 20) 9-0 FFW 16-3 loss Enemy top frag 26 second frag 25, our team 2 people with under 35 ADR. And then a 16-4 loss with the enemy top frag dropping 47 kills. I'm really cautious to call hacks, but It's insane to me that gold nova 1's can drop 40 bombs on me and have better aim than people I know who are LEM + in Faceit level 7. is MM more inbalanced now, or is Faceit level 6 truly below GN1 MM?

fo5jl9,hamuel69,This Game is a Mess,"I've just come back to playing after 6 months and seen the impact of the recent updates.

CS:GO is now the most played game on steam. We waited 2 years or something for an update that is so boring that I can't even get past the first week of missions. We've got these new ""agent skins"" that nobody asked for which fuck up the gameplay because it's so easy to hide in plain sight and be invisible if you pay for a good skin.

As a result of the shitty player models, my screen now briefly freezes whenever I see an enemy and I'm running an i7-8700k (used to get constant 300fps), so I imagine everyone has this problem.

I used to work in a small game studio and I know this is hardly comparable because of the difference in scale but whenever we had a technical problem that affected &gt;30% of players, we would pretty much spend all of our time working on it for a few days before we fixed it. Problems with the engine and FPS drops could be the main focus for the whole team for days.

How are the standards this low for a game that gets more than 1.1 million concurrent players?

When I'm in LEM, I hit at least 25 kills every game, and I get to supreme pretty easily by solo carrying games.

But once I'm in supreme.... oh boy. I get smashed, like completely and I feel hopeless. I usually hit bdtween 15 and 20 kills, never more.

The worse part is the teammates. Why the hell, is it that once I rankup to supreme, my teammates seem to suddenly be complete degenerates.

They make basic mistakes I see no one in LEM do, they bait on T side and make sure to enter last bombsites, they're super toxic for absolutely no reason etc... (the list goes on and on)

What's the secret I don't have? How do I improve on an individual level? I just deranked back to LEM for the 7th time and this is getting tiring...

fo4370,cd6_,Calculating Odds - EPL Season 11 (Group B),"In less than 5 hours, the last day of EPL Season 11 for Groups A &amp; B will commence. I wanted to take a look at Group B - most specifically what could come out from the 3 matches that will be played at the same time. So I've ran some simulations and applied the tiebreaker rules - and here is what I've got...

# Current Standings:

If the Round 1 finished right now for Group B, before the last match day, then the standings would be as following:

1. Fnatic - 9 pts
2. North - 6 pts
3. BIG - 6 pts
4. Natus Vincere - 6 pts
5. forZe - 6 pts
6. Complexity Gaming - 3 pts

This means that Fnatic would move directly to Round 2, while North &amp; BIG would have had to play the decider matches. BUT, we still have 3 more matches - that bring in quiet a lot of cases, especially given that all teams mathematically still have a shot.

# 8 Cases:

Basic tiebreaker system for EPL has 9 steps before extra matches, but all of the ties in our cases - don't go over step 1 (i.e. we don't care about map differentials or round differentials). So there are only 2 outcomes for each game (W, L) - and with 3 matches, that makes 8 cases (2 \* 2 \* 2 = 8). Here they are below:

# Outcomes:

Mathematically speaking - Fnatic, Natus Vincere &amp; BIG have the biggest chance of qualifying:

As if being a BIG supporter isn't hard enough I have tried to figure out the tierbreaker scenarios for the last match day. Hope I got it right. Key points: 
     
- Fnatic can actually still drop out but only in Scenario 2b where BIG &amp; North hold 2 tiebreakers while Fnatic &amp; NaVi hold 1 each with NaVi winning the direct match  
- BIG can only proceed when winning their match against Forze. If they win they are guaranteed to proceed  
- NaVi can only proceed when winning their match against Fnatic. If they win they are guaranteed to proceed  
- Forze proceeds when winning their match against BIG or even when losing to BIG in Scenario 1d when NaVi &amp; North lose  
- North proceeds when winning their match against Complexity or even when losing to Complexity in Scenario 1c when NaVi &amp; BIG lose  
- Complexity cannot proceed to the next stage

I just started picking cs go up again, and the amount of racism and homophobia is shocking. I play many online games, and I have to say that this community is by far the worst. F bombs were dropped within the first round of the match. Once I spoke up against this, I got flamed beyond imagine. I just reported everyone that was speaking with such vile language.

fnsfr6,Jackson_Donzella,Sensitivity conversion help,"I've been playing CSGO a lot lately with the sensitivity: 2.4 in game, and 400 dpi, adding up to a total of 960edpi.  I have also been playing Minecraft a lot recently, and to get the same sensitivity I used  [https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/](https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/) and played with the sensitivity that the site gave me in Minecraft for a while, but when I opened CSGO to go practice and play some Faceit, I noticed that my aim was totally out of whack and I couldn't really hit anything at all.  I realized earlier that the issue is the FOV difference.  I play with an FOV of 90 in Minecraft.  When I change the Minecraft FOV input on the mouse sensitivity website, the equivalent sensitivity to CSGO doesn't change at all.

CSGO: 2.4 and 400dpi 

Minecraft FOV: 90

can someone please help me out here? I really don't feel like having to get used to an essentially new sensitivity every time I want to play CSGO coming from Minecraft.  My assumption is that the issue is that FOV is not taken into consideration while calculating the equivalent sensitivity, but I'm no mathematician, if anyone knows exactly what the issue is please let me know.

fnrnaa,xxrandom98xx,Perfect Time To Add More Maps Valve,"With the operation coming to a close and the major being pushed back to November, this is a great time for Valve to add more maps into the game.  The Faceit MapCore Competition just ended and some of those maps like Anubis and Mutiny [Reccomended by Warowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcba6y19DSA) should be added to Scrimmage mode to replace those maps that haven't changed in what feels like forever. Scrimmage is a game mode where the maps should be changed out at least every month and a half imo. It gives the community an avenue to try more maps than they otherwise would be able to. 

I see countless posts of people wanting Cobblestone put back (and not the remake). I agree, as before I loved playing the map. I also remember when the game had a multitude of maps in it like Aztec, Italy, etc. Valve's logic at the time was that removing maps would improve the que times for the rest of the maps (I can't find the exact quote, but I'm sure someone could find it). This largely turned out to be incorrect as que times pretty much remained the same. The people that wanted to play those lesser played maps were mostly content to wait it out. There was a point where I waited over an hour for a solo que of Aztec. It became my favorite map (yes I'm aware it's pretty 1-sided and no I'm not nostalgic about it, I didn't start playing until early 2016). 

Fast forward to today, CS:GO has over a million players daily. Now would be a fantastic time to try to increase the size of the map pool again (I'm just talking about being able to play it in competitive, not necessarily replacing any of the active duty maps (unless wink wink Vertigo for new Cache or old Cobble)).",1,1584996535,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fnrnaa/perfect_time_to_add_more_maps_valve/,GlobalOffensive,1

My question is: if my internet isn't able to reach the top limit set for CS:GO, should I lower rates and/or interpolation?

I even started initiating conversations with them over the voice chat. ""Hey, Cat. How are you doing bro?"", ""Bulldog, you sure seem to play a lot of DM mate."", ""Daisy, remember me from last game?"". But they never seem to respond. :(

It was today, on day 4 that I realized it. I left my bros DM'ing in D2 and went for some variety maps, but there they were again. Then it hit me. Those people never existed. I made them up in my head. After that first DM game my bros were gone. I was playing with mere impersonators. 

TLDR: I'm stupid.

fnqe4b,x3ro0o,The settings from my Zowie ZA11 feel different on my Zowie EC-1?,"Hey guys, currently Ive been using a Zowie ZA11 for ages on 400dpi (red) setting. Seeing my modded rainbow Leopold 750 keyboard I thought a Zowie EC-1 Devina pink should fit perfectly looks wise and as far as I know both mice should have the same sensor, so in essence should feel the same sensivity wise on the same settings, or not? Well, not in my case.

Normally I play on the following settings, mouse on 400 dpi, windows sensivity on 6/11, ingame sensivity 2.91, raw input on and mouse acceleration off with my Zowie ZA11 and all is fine.

Now, when switching to the EC-1 I plug the mouse in, and switch de dpi setting to 400dpi (red). The only thing the EC-1 has that the ZA11 doesn‚Äôt, is the hz setting for the interpolation. But with the EC-1 on 400dpi and all aforementioned settings used, it doesn‚Äôt matter if I use 125, 500 or 1000hz, none of them feel the same. The 500hz feels closest to my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù feel using the ZA11, but it still feels off. 

Anyone on here made a similar switch and had the same issue? Or happen to have any idea what this could be? I don‚Äôt want to start fiddling again for ages to get it as close as possible. Big reason in choosing the EC-1 was the supposedly same sensor, so I shouldn‚Äôt need to deal with finding the correct settings.

Let me give you one of many examples : yesterday, I was playing on Mirage, and I saw one CT peek from short with the ""master chief"" green skin. Then, a few seconds later, a second one peeked with the default skin. The info was given to my mates in apps : both B players are playing short. I really think we secured a plant because of this info...

It would have been harder to know that they both peeked if they wore the same default skin. It seems like I benefit from this extra knowledge at least one every game. Did you notice too ?

fnkfru,mbCARMAC,CSGO Rio Major moved to Nov 2020 - all info here," Hey guys,

It is now official ‚Äì the CSGO Rio Major was rescheduled to take place in the November Major time slot (and I suppose unless you just woke up from a 3+ month long come, I do not need to say why). 

Here are the basics of what you need to know (it should go without saying that I am not speaking on behalf of Valve, but relaying the information we have access to):

1) There will be one CSGO Major this year. The prize pools of the May and November Majors have been added together, making the prize purse for this Major $2,000,000. I would not draw far-fetched conclusions out of this.

2) The venue remains the same and if you have a ticket to the event, your ticket will remain valid. You can also choose to get a refund here: [https://www.esl-one.com/csgo/rio/2020/03/esl-one-rio-2020-attendee-update/](https://www.esl-one.com/csgo/rio/2020/03/esl-one-rio-2020-attendee-update/)

3) Qualification and invitations for the November Major need be considered afresh ‚Äì there‚Äôs currently no official information on who is qualified and who is not, and how all that will work. Those details, and others like content for the May Minor / Major time frame, are currently being worked through by Valve and ESL. It requires a great deal of work and consideration, so please be patient on this front as those questions are resolved.

4) Please note that the Champions Stage dates are shifted by a week (closer to December) due to venue availability. The new dates are: November 19-22. The remaining dates will be verified and provided within days.

Feel free to leave comments or ask questions in the thread. Those answers that do exist or haven‚Äôt been covered above I am happy to give. The questions I am unable to answer may still be valuable, if only to understand what people‚Äôs problems and concerns are that we maybe haven‚Äôt thought of.

Thanks,

Michal",357,1584972111,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fnkfru/csgo_rio_major_moved_to_nov_2020_all_info_here/,GlobalOffensive,1

fnj7au,thomas_20two,Blackscreen in fullscreen mode after refreshrate change,"I used to run my Monitor at 60hz since that is the official max refreshrate it offers.

Now I found out that you can actually change that to higher Hz numbers with some patching of the drivers. I created a custom resolution and refreshrate profile in the Nvidia Controlpanel at 1440p and 85hz. I tried higher numbers but I would just get a blackscreen until it reverts the change auto.. Desktop runs fine and I checked all settings on my computer and everything says that Im running at 85 hz now.

Now I have following problem:

As soon as I start Csgo my gameclient goes blackscreen. I can alt tab out of it to go back to my desktop. 

I went into the start options of the game and put  -windowed .

Now I can start csgo and go into the settings in game and put it on borderless window.

However, gsync only works when you run a game on fullscreen mode. Whenever I put it into fullscreen mode in the settings tho I get blackscreen again and I have to close the game via task manager or ""close window"" in my taskbar.

Does anybody have an idea on what to do?

I really want to try to get it to run on 85hz. It has to do something with gsync Im pretty sure.

I have some weird lag spikes in CSGO on Clean Windows 10 (official build from MS)

It happens when I'm peeking/someone is peeking me (var goes like 4-5, barely playable) and in a big fights (when I peek 5 enemies or entering big fight), var becomes red (like 30+) until I'm dead. It also causes fps drops and sound lag.

Here's my setup:  
Ryzen 5 3500 (4.1GHz OC)  
8 GB RAM (not sure about manufaturer, cheapest one I could find in the store, also OC 3200 MHz)  
MSI ARMOR 1060 3GB OCV1 GPU  
256 GB NVMe SSD SiloconPower.  


I tried to change snd\_mixahead, enabling/disabling cl\_forcepreload, turned off shader cache on Nvidia control panel settings, disable all background processes as possible (including some Windows services). Also tried all these FPS cfg's, different launch options, etc.

fni6x3,Doqtori,"Is it worth it to join/create a ""team"" at silver, or should I just stick to SoloQ?","I have IRL friends who play CS, all around the same rank as me, but it just honestly isn't working out. Everytime we play, we wait mby 15 minutes for everyone to join, then usually 30 minutes while they talk about skins and open fucking cases, before we start the Q and argue about what maps to pick (I've only got to play a handful of maps because they don't want to play 3/4th's of them), and that's just the problems before we get into a game. After that, we just sort of meme around. And while that is fun, I'd actually want to play the game competitively every once in a while. (Also to add, their mentality is completely wrong, saying that ""we should just give up"" because the enemy team is 5 points ahead, blaming themselves for everything, etc.)

I used to play Overwatch quite a bit (still do), and I had no friends to play with, and while looking for some, I suddenly found myself in a ""team"". We did scrims, played in a couple tournaments, etc., we even had a coach: and suddenly I was ranking up from ~high silver to diamond.

So, I'm thinking, could something like this work in CS? Is it worth it? If it is, how would one go about doing it? For Overwatch, there are Blizzard's own forums for LFG, and that's where I found my current OW team. Is there an equivalent for CS?

Ever since getting a ""new"" screen I have issues playing stretched resolutions. 

I always played 4:3 stretched on a 21"" monitor. But currently Ive got a AOC G2590FX in 24,5"" with a native 1920*1080 resolution. Whenever I set it to a 4:3 resolution it switches to the correct one, but with black bars. Not the stretched one. Thru google I found instructions to up scale the video, but as soon as I scale it up my FPS turns to sh*t. Is there any way to play 4:3 resolution stretched without upscaling and losing a load of fps? As a former 1.6 player I really cant get used to these big resolutions sadly :(

All thanks is greatly appreciated!

Being that Astralis is owned by RFRSH and RFRSH owns Blast Pro Series , we could maybe see a change in Blast events in wich teams can sign with 6(or more) players into the tournament and make a switch at one point in the tournament(kind of like soccer/ LOL(i heared that's possible in LOL)) or go as far as having a different roster for a different map (and the teams instead of practicing all maps with the same roster could switch up the players-based on their performance on the specifical map) and then have all TO implement the system!

fn8jfn,DrRazzz,Valve can't control their own game...,"The exploit released a few days ago that allows cheaters to rage-hack and crash the server afterwords is still unpatched. These 'players' are running rampant (in NA at least) and I'm encountering these guys almost 50% of the time. Legit players are forced to sit there and suffer through HvH games until the inevitable server crash to avoid competitive cool downs.

The fact that this is occurring in HIGH TRUST FACTOR matchmaking is ridiculous... Either trust factor is completely screwed up and easy to exploit, or the community is filled with fucked up losers who like to ruin people's day. Perhaps a bit of both. Can't believe that I had to go through 4 games of this bullshit this afternoon.

I understand that the game is old and therefore easy to develop cheats for. Even though I think Valve can do better to stop cheaters, the situation is (somewhat) understandable. However, letting a GAME BREAKING exploit run rampant for multiple DAYS?! Considering how widespread the issue is, it's obvious that the exploit (which fuels rage hacking) is in some public cheat; it shouldn't be that difficult to address. Maybe I'm being a bit unreasonable here, but in my opinion, Valve's response so far is completely unacceptable...",3,1584915823,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fn8jfn/valve_cant_control_their_own_game/,GlobalOffensive,1

fn7296,aapoxd,Having a low trustfactor,"Hi, I've had red trustfactor for like a week now, sometimes it gets up and almost immediately drops back after a few games. I play a lot of wingman with my friend to warmup for faceit games. We both have high tier inventories and have many service medals from 2016-2020. I've done overwatches, played many different gamemodes and HAVEN'T reported anyone, because it seems to affect the trustfactor. I have started thinking of buying commends if that would help because that seems like the last option. Or what could I do? Stop playing matchmaking and start playing only on faceit?",19,1584910607,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fn7296/having_a_low_trustfactor/,GlobalOffensive,1

When it records in black bars, I can see a very subtle white crosshair slightly next to my crosshair in CSGO. Not in game, just in clips their is another crosshair just offput of the one you see in game. This has made me paranoid for multiple reasons. I‚Äôm gonna update in a second with a picture of it.

Sometimes I will be hitting crazy shots, and I will clip it and be like ‚Äú I bet it‚Äôs recording stretched‚Äù go check the clips and it‚Äôs stretched. Like it‚Äôs not placebo effect Becuase I don‚Äôt check before I play. 

Yes this all sounds kinda crazy, but I hit a lot more shots and everything feels better when it‚Äôs recording in stretched (I play stretched), and when it‚Äôs recording in black bars with the slight off put white crosshair everything feels off. 

What‚Äôs causing the switch in the first place? I literally change nothing and it will just switch on me. 


Yes the playing different thing may be dumb and a conspiracy but ignoring that why does shawdow play change aspect ratio randomly?

the White is not my csgo crosshair.

I am a returning CSGO player (last time I played was around 2016, peaked at double AK) and I am trying to improve by practicing and watching tons of youtube videos and streams. One problem that I have however is that I don't know when to use all the shooting techniques I have learned. For example, when I am shooting at someone far away, should I tap shoot, shoot in small bursts, strafe slowly, spam ADAD, or even crouch? This question also applies to close quarters shooting, where people crouching seems kind of like a gamble. In essence, this is the question I'm asking: when should I spray/burst/tap, strafe slowly/fast/spam ADAD, or crouch?

fn0sjt,Devakh,Mini lag spikes/teleports,"Hello guys,

for some time now I have had a problem with the game and I can't seem to find a solution for it. Maybe someone of you has experienced a similar problem:

Maybe every 20-30 seconds or so I get a micro-lag for roughly half a second at most. During this time no input of mine will go through meaning: I can't fire, I don't move or anything else on my screen or the server. After the ""spike"" is over my ""screen"" teleports like 2 steps in the direction I last moved. Teammates and enemies alike also notice these microlags on the server and informed me of my lagging.

Before the spike I have 20 ping, instantly after the spike netgrahp shows appr. 10-15 ping higher and then ping goes down back to normal. I have no idea what even can cause this, it is the only online game in which this kind of stuff happens, I don't notice any kind of lag in any other online games, including other shooters .. It can't be my connection, I have 100/10 up down, my pc is connected via ethernet and I already tried playing without any other device in my network.

I literally have no idea what can cause this and it is very frustrating... I have tried many fixes on micro stutters which have not helped at all..

I hope someone out there can help me fix my problem .. if you need further information please leave a comment/pm me.

fn0du8,LewAshby309,When will we see new infos about the esl rio major? Isn't it already extremely unlikely to happen considering the situation in brasil?,"Let's see it realistic. Brasil is like 1-3 weeks behind europe in terms of the outbreak of covid 19. The government didn't do anything till 3 days ago. Only local states or cities have taken measures, like rio.

Brasil is now in the amount of known cases that is higher than 1000 and the first deaths appeared.

The country now takes measures and closed borders completely to 8 neighbor countries. From monday on the entry into the country for people from europe, china, australia,... gets denied for at least 30 days.

Since the government reacted very late and acted even worse by denying how drastic the outbreak is and the president even calling it a hysteria makes a lot of experts think the outbreak in brasil will be as drastic if not more drastic than in italy. That would mean the future counteractions will be drastic as well.

Basicly a crowd at esl rio is highly unlikely. Even the event itself is unlikly. Teams can't travel, don't want to travel or might get quarantined. Same for the ESL staff.

Why do valve and esl wait that long to postpone or cancel the event? Every big event i know, except olympia which gets heavily critizised for it, got canceled or postponed.

I even doubt the major itself will happen except it's postponed which probably means the cancelation of the second 2020 major. Online tournament is an unlikely option. The teams are from everywhere. The ping would be unplayable. You would have to get all teams at least on the same continent. Which leads us again to the travel issues i mentioned above. Even then does the ESL or Valve want a major like that? Online, maybe no player cams, missing teams, teams with substitutes, no crowd,....",19,1584885661,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fn0du8/when_will_we_see_new_infos_about_the_esl_rio/,GlobalOffensive,1

fmyvr2,TGAIO,Why is MM suddenly so unbalanced?,"First off all, i am certainly not the best player nor overly experienced, but MM is just a shitshow now.

I was on a easy winstreak upto MG1 and suddenly i got placed in matches with either trolls or my team consisting of lvl 10 players while the other team has 3 people with the 5 year veteran coin.

Since then i am literally only losing matches while being top fraggers and got down to Gold Nova 3.   
I don't really have the time to queue as a 5 stack and it isn't fun to solo queue and get a 3stack clan to play against.

fmxdal,charizardzxc,looking for feedback on my CSGO fanfiction! ^^,"""Bomb has been planted. 40 seconds to detonation.""
There wasn't much that scared the seasoned SAS agent. As far as trauma and violence went, he had seen most of it. He'd seen corruption and infighting within the counter-terrorist forces. He'd seen terrorist attacks stopped, and he'd seen them carried out. He had seen friends die, he had seen enemies die, and he had seen plenty of innocent bystanders die. Eventually, he became jaded and closed-off, recounting his experiences only through dark jokes, and releasing pent-up stress through the barrel of his gun. But this time, something was different. Forget all the people he had seen die before. As he heard the warning on the comms that the ITF had gotten the explosive planted... for the first time, he was in danger of seeing himself die.
He had heard that time moved in slow motion in moments like this, but it seemed like the opposite was happening. Every tiny action he took seemed like a huge decision and risk. He had trained and practiced hard, and he could reload his carbine in seconds. But how many seconds? He only had 40 of them... 35 by now.
Quickly putting his M4 on his back in favor of a small knife, he sprinted down a long curved alley leading to the bombsite. He barely processed the AK-47 shot whizzing over his head from behind; he just took one fluid motion to grab his sidearm from his hip, whip around, and shoot the man in the head, all without stopping his movement. He subconsciously complimented himself on his own aim as he skidded around the corner and into a courtyard containing a large fountain. He saw the bomb flashing red and beeping, so close but so far away. He knew that if he tried his luck with the wires, he would get shot by the hiding separatists. Recklessly, he peered around corners, behind the crates, tried to see through the stained glass on the nearby church. He was overwhelmed. There were seven dead bodies within walking distance, and he just needed to add two more to that list. As some sort of stingy, half-assed blessing from God, one of the terrorists peered around a stack of coffins, quickly gaining a hole in his head approximately 5.56 millimeters wide.
The agent looked back to the bomb and saw a member of his team on the ground, missing most of his leg, with his eyes rolled back in their sockets. He felt his boot splash in the puddle of blood as he took a knee to try and defuse the bomb. There was still a terrorist left, but there was no other option at this point. This bomb was just incessantly letting out electronic beeps, and they were getting faster and faster. There was no more time for fighting, civilian lives were at stake.
Which wire to cut... is it the red one or the blue one? He remembered it was never the one they cut in movies. But which one was that? He wanted to say blue, and he moved his cutters to the red one, but then he saw out of the corner of his eye a yellow wire, a black one, a green one, and he knew that he had run out of time. He cut the red wire and nothing happened for several seconds.
...
So this was what heaven was like. It certainly smelled good, like cinnamon and vanilla and sunshine. And the cloudy white depictions were surprisingly correct. All around him, he saw nothing but white clouds... In fact, he couldn't see much else around him. No angels with harps- but that was okay, he wasn't a huge fan of harp music anyway. He looked under him and managed to see through the thick fluffy clouds. There was an old brick floor, and behind him was a barrel... The white gas began to clear away, revealing the bright blue sky, and he had to turn his eyes away from... Was that God? No, just the sun. He wondered where heaven was in relation to the rest of the world. Was it between earth and the sun? Doesn't that mean you would only go to heaven if you died around noon? And all the good people who died in their sleep were probably in hell? Is it just random chance? How would sunlight shine through anyway? The smoke cleared further, and he saw that the colorful stained glass windows on the church were still intact. He was beginning to suspect that he wasn't in heaven.
Although for someone who wasn't in heaven, he was beginning to feel a warm, generally good feeling coming over him. Quickly, he realized his crotch was bulging... A hot, throbbing mass had begun to spring up. He felt the blood surging through his cock, and wasn't even surprised. Although you couldn't see it through his mask, a trance-like, excited, slightly insane look came over him. He scrabbled at his pants a little, trying to get rid of the layers between his gloved hand and his hard dick. So much Kevlar, all these zippers... He frustratedly tried to touch himself in any way he could through his pants. If these clothes could stop a bullet, they could definitely stop his hand, although he wasn't conscious enough to realize that. In a horny fugue state of sorts, he tried whatever he could, tried getting to his ass, tried shedding the armor in every way he could think of, but he had no luck. The 40-something man had trouble getting it up with his wife, and no sexual habits past that, so it was certainly new for him to be desperately clawing at his clothes in an effort to empty his balls in the blood of some dead soldiers.
He was oblivious to the slow footsteps of a masked man approaching him from the entrance of the church. He had his guns casually holstered, and a smug smile on his face. The CT didn't care.
""Need some help over there?"", the terrorist drawled to his enemy.
The CT threw up his hands in surrender, inviting any help he could get. He didn't care that he was supposed to murder the person standing over him, he had more important things on his empty, cum-addled mind.
The terrorist, like a predator playing with his prey, grabbed the CT by the wrists and gently pulled him up, pinning him against the plaster wall. He removed both their masks and leaned in to sandwich the agent's body between his own and the wall, pressing one face into the other, slipping his tongue inside to exchange saliva and explore his toy's mouth. The CT's moans were satisfying and exciting, and they invited the terrorist deeper into him, the CT's tongue curling around the T's, feeling the inside of the cheek, letting himself go limp and be held in his attacker's arms as he was penetrated like this. The T slowly pulled away, now almost cradling the CT. Thick, viscous ropes of saliva strung between their tongues as he backed up, looking deep into his eyes, their pupils dilated in ecstasy.
""Your tax dollars at work, folks."" The T made himself chuckle with a soft, low murmur. ""Fine, I'll give you what you need now.""
He turned the helpless soldier around to press his muscular back against his own stomach, his hard-on pressing against the agent's ass, which was surprisingly squishy even through the protective clothing. He leaned in as the CT stayed limp on him, pressing his head into his neck and biting it a little- after a little consideration, biting it a lot. His hand drifted down to undo both their belts, letting two pistols and some grenades fall to the ground with a rustling noise. One hand was around the agent's belly for support, and the other one slid down, down, down, through thick layers of who-knows-what, to the sensitive areas that the military tries hard to protect and keep sealed away from the world. His fingers pushed it all aside effortlessly and felt their way around the rock-hard vascular shaft, which throbbed and pulsed at the slightest touch, and his fingers wrapped around the heavy, full balls. He gently pulled away, which the CT protested as best as he could for the few seconds before two fingers were slid into his mouth.
The terrorist was so close, violating the CT in so many ways. His hot breath could be felt on the agent's ear, as could the air movement as he let out a whisper that was quieter than a pin dropping but came in loud and clear to the CT. 
""Drool.""
The CT didn't have to be asked twice. He started salivating as if his captor's fingers were chocolate in his mouth, he let his lips open slightly and some of the thick clear liquid dripped down his chin, into the T's palm, onto the ground, but mostly coating and pooling around the fingers. The sweet submissive soldier let out a long, needy moan for good measure as the fingers were pulled again back out of his mouth and down to his throbbing cock, leaving a trail of slime down from the belly button. With the oozing wetness, the T could really feel each individual crevice, imperfection, and artery, not to mention each tiny movement, each pump of blood from the heart down to here, each twitch caused by the stroking of some long-forgotten sensitive zone that had been neglected for years as a result of a dying marriage and was now being rediscovered. His hand lightly slid over it all, feeling it and knowing it and conquering it.
He leaned in farther, his breathing getting heavy to match his partner's hysteria, bit an ear, and whispered roughly ""I know you want to get it all out, you're making it clear. Come on, do it. Don't hold back."" With a drawn-out and overwhelmed moan that contained everything he was feeling, the CT went completely limp in the T's arms and came. He just held himself there, completely trusting the T to keep touching him and violating him as he let out a strong stream of hot white ropes that filled his underwear and oozed around his ballsack, dripped and squirted onto the T's fingers as he relentlessly stroked him, it lubricated his cock and somehow made the experience even more intense as the cum made every touch feel even better.",13,1584870069,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fmxdal/looking_for_feedback_on_my_csgo_fanfiction/,GlobalOffensive,1

fmw8g4,imares,Rank does not equate to skill and why you shouldn't value CSGO's ranking system.,"After top fragging my entire match history, winning 7, tying 2, and losing 1, I have not ranked up from silver 4. I used to be supreme a few years ago and I'm approaching the monster again: standard matchmaking. After jumping around a few FPS and playing Apex, I can with utmost certainty tell you that I recommend playing any of the third party softwares over MM. I don't understand why Valve is so incompetent or why they don't take into account your performance and, supposedly, only MVPs (yeah, that gold star the bomb defuser gets and not the guy who 4ks and wins the round). This is the only modern ranking system that is sealed shut and does not show your statistics reflecting your elo gain. It is quite pathetic. Semi-rant but my god is it awful. Apex legends, for example, allowed me to reach diamond while queueing with my gold friend because I played insane every match. Why can CSGO not follow suit? Why are they so stuck on penalizing good players? I have no idea. ESEA, FACEIT, CEVO, go there if you want to retain sanity. GL out there boys. Valve, you keep making skins lmfao",34,1584863187,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fmw8g4/rank_does_not_equate_to_skill_and_why_you/,GlobalOffensive,1

fmw1m0,sman6000,My idea for a krieg nerf,"How would you feel if valve decided to nerf the krieg by making it interchangeable with the AUG on CT side, similar to the MP7 and MP5-SD, while also increasing the price to $3500 for both teams?

Recently when we party up we get a message that his trust factor is significantly lower than mine. But we haven't been toxic, used cheats or anything like that. My friends pretty good at aiming and maybe silver players thought he was cheating when he was out aiming them consistently.

Don't know what to do about this, MM is horrible (cheaters, incredibly toxic people, trolls) and we're not good enough for face it (I'm gn2 he's gn4). Played one face it game and oh man it was a bloodbath.

Any advice/pointers? TIA",1,1584861284,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fmvx0o/how_to_fix_low_trust_factor/,GlobalOffensive,1

fmvmjy,Ace_Boogey1017,EU vs NA ranks. Is there a difference? I think so.,"Hello all, the title explains my question. I was just wondering if anyone else had any experience playing on both servers. I'm from the United States but I am moving to Germany soon so i figured I'd see what my MM will be like once i get there. 

I only have 200 hours in the game and I'm Silver 4. I get shit on, on a consistant basis and cycle through S3 to SEM depending on how well im playing that week. Based on that information, you should be able to tell I'm definetly not very good and I dont have much expierience either. Going positive means it was a good game for me. id say on average i do shit 8/10 games.

&amp;#x200B;

I've played about 20-30 games now on EU, in the last 2-3 weeks. With 180 ping typically I have gotten multiple 30K games and my first 40K game. Id say 9/10 times I top frag and have close to 2.0 + K/D. Especially once I find Western Europeans that can speak english so that i'm able to understand the calls.

&amp;#x200B;

So whats the deal? Is it just the EU is very bad compared to NA or is it something along of the lines that NA is filled with Smurfs and derankers? (Side Note:) I just remembered that Ive also noticed that team coordination seems 4x better on NA. 

&amp;#x200B;

fmmwig,happenedthisso,So this happened today,"This dude was using spinbot during the game and had friends playing so he could not kick him. He said after they win the game he would crash the server to avoid overwatch and still get the win. Not sure if he can avoid overwatch doing this but if what he says is true I hope something would be done about this. Was even thinking about extending the game just for the sake of being annoying for them but in the end I would not have gained anything from.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is couple of screenshots I took during the game.

I want to smoke monster from CT Spawn in faceit games. But if i go on a offline server (128 Tick ofc) every Lineup i see on Youtube dont work for me! I tried like ten different, even with trying adjusting the lineup in every direction, i cant get the smoke to pop on the rails and land like they do on Youtube.. I checked like 20 times for the right lineup and im 100% sure they are right... I really dont know what is wrong...

I am playing on 16:9 Widescreen with 1920\*1080. Every other smoke i see on Youtube is working, i have a good working jump bind. I have no problems with jumpthrow lineups on other maps, they always work like they work on YouTube..

I am trying for 2hours now and i am more than tilted, i tried everything and all i want is this little Monster Smoke.  I restartet the game, the map and tried on other days, it never worked for me..

fmkenf,CrabSoupSpoon,Quick question from old player,"Hi all. I played this game last in like 2013 but could never stand how the only official casual mode was 10 v 10. I never wanted to play ranked with sweaty toxic Russians, but I also never want to just play cluster fuck CS. It's just not the game.

So is there an option nowadays to play the game in the classic 30 round, 5 v 5 format without playing ranked? (Official servers)",6,1584818162,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fmkenf/quick_question_from_old_player/,GlobalOffensive,1

I join back, the CT‚Äôs are 4-0 up, and the round ends. I‚Äôm dropping AK‚Äôs because I am a fucking money mogul at this point and before the round even begins, well look what happens MY GAME FREEZES FOR A 3RD TIME.

I just kind of sit there in awe and give up. I type to my teammates that I‚Äôm sorry (because you know, I can still technically ‚Äúplay‚Äù) type exit for the 3rd and final time, and sit in defeat.

They like the competitive aspect of the game and really try hard improving their aims and knowledge, however having to deal with hackers every game really bums them out.

They are slowly losing interest because of this, so my question:

We kick him, all 4 of us get dc'd and a ban for kicking too many teammates. They're only 30 minute bans but, if im having to play in a rank that doesn't match my own skill, get a low tf because of it and have toxic teammates,atleast give me the chance to kick as many of them as i want?",20,1584802130,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fmg229/low_tf_kicked_too_many_teammates/,GlobalOffensive,1

It wasnt alway been like this it was running normally last year until december. I dont know what happened but it crashes every 5 minutes. I saw some yt videos of people getting rid of this problem by going in bios and turning some stuff on or off but i dont have advanced option in my bios, tried updating it, unlocking with some button combinations but nothing.
 And one more thing i have like 90fps on low settings 720p and if i crank it to high 1080p it only drops to 70-ish fps. I think it can go higher at low 720p but no luck finding out how...

**Denmark:**

Basically the Astralis lineup

tarik's spot was a tough one, with Ethan,autimatic and oBo having a good shout as well.

**Sweden:**

fnatic lineup

Brazil:

FalleN-fer-coldzera-yuurih-KSCERATO

this could very well be THE best lineup here if everyone was firing, but fer and FalleN don't seem so hot right now.

France:

shox-RpK-ZyWoo-kennyS-JaCkz

AmaNEk and apEX could probably get in for RpK though.

Poland:

MICHU-dycha-mhL-GruBy-Furlan

damn, Poland don't look nowhere as good as they did during the days of VP, although this one isn't too bad.

Russia:

Jame-FL1T-flamie-electronic-boombl4

This actually looks pretty good

Canada:

NAF-Twistzz-stanislaw-subroza-WARDELL

Ukraine:

s1mple-somedieyoung-rAge-crush-aivyaN

damn, this looks pretty dire

Finland:

ENCE -xseveN +Aleksib XD

China:

Germany:

Australia:

100T -jkaem +dexter 

Kazakhstan:

fme4e1,HeinzMeinz1,Office MM (Vienna Server) full of cheaters - (warning),"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I am really confused, what just happened to me. To be exact, it happened 3 times in a row on Office (Vienna server). To be clear, I don¬¥t call some random dudes cheaters if they are just better than me, but in the following cases, it has been obvious all of the times (banging through the ground and killing us, speed hacks, spinbots, changing their names every 2 seconds, etc.). 

I have been inactive for like a year now from CS MM and just played Office for the last few days. It really went smoothly all the times as you might see in the picture. Yesterday, at around 1:00 am, I wanted to play another one. The complete opponent lobby was full of obvious cheaters. I canceled the match, played another one 30 minutes afterward. The Result: the same. There has been again a full lobby of cheaters. The opponents in both rounds seemed to have other profiles but belonged to the same group of people. All of them spoke German (and insulted me, bragged about their cheats) and wanted me to join their discord. I refused and canceled again. Today at around 1:00 pm, I tried my luck again. The result: the same. 

I know, Office is probably unplayable for most of you, because just a few people play this map. Usually, I also play different maps, but I kinda liked to stick to this map for the last few days. My question: Have there been such cases on other maps too? It seems like there is something strange.

&amp;#x200B;

fmbnmu,DanielSensenbringer,Lockdown FFA-DM from WaSe for helping with social distancing,"Hey!

These days we all need to become Global Elite in social distancing. Some of us might have already been Supreme but now we are forced to go PRO.

To help you with this I've started to setup three FFA deathmatch servers which are totally free. This means there are no 40minutes bans, no VIP days and no restrictions to the last slot. The waiting queue for joining should work. The AWP stays restricted as we don't want to many AWPs on the server. But there are 3min out of 44min per cycle where everybody is using an AWP and a pistol. The only way you could get kicked is if a VIP is joining on a full server with the console or a successful voteban which requires a 2/3 majority for success. These servers stay in this free state at least as long as there are active school lockdowns in NA or EU due to the coronavirus.

The IPs and locations:

* Frankfurt 185.242.115.196:27515 
* Chicago 108.178.7.138:27075 
* Atlanta 23.111.157.138:27015 

MultiCFG:

* 5min pistols
* 17min rifles
* 3min AWPs/pistols
* 5min HS/rifles
* 14min rifles

Ranking:

* rankDS system
* points will not be reset until 2020/05/01

The servers are new and people are not having them in their favorites. I'll appreciate everybody helping to get these servers full. If there are any problems please tell me. I'll help as quick as possible. Thank you to all VIPs who are supporting us. Your support makes this possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Best Regards

I have \~700 hours (690 to be exact) and I also have red trust factor. I don't have many people to play with so I usually solo queue. The maps I play are Mirage, Cache, Inferno, and Overpass.

Here are my vods. (In each vod my name is robert)

I did ok in this game, considering there were a few people who I assumed were smurfing or cheating (they were playing very good for their level.)

steam://rungame/730/76561202255233023/+csgo\_download\_match%20CSGO-ZocKu-YxddW-Nvtc5-iGSET-qkSSH

steam://rungame/730/76561202255233023/+csgo\_download\_match%20CSGO-o6bFr-yGWmw-O5tGc-xtPvw-s2ohH

steam://rungame/730/76561202255233023/+csgo\_download\_match%20CSGO-OVjiL-Vov5A-466Ub-q7B8f-ttB3J

I went positive this game and we ended up winning. Wannabe Zuhn was hacking and he showed me them.

fm96wo,skidz86,True Sight for CS,"True Sight : The International mini docos for dota are amazing and I dont even play dota competitively. I wish we had some high quality content of this type for CS. 

The smoke breaks in between games where teams try to bounce back and reset mentally is so interesting.

Don't get me wrong I love frag videos and highlights but the true sight docos bring it to another level.

I'd love something like this for one of the CS majors.",5,1584764100,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fm96wo/true_sight_for_cs/,GlobalOffensive,1
fm95yo,DankMeemeBoiii,People make it special. A CS:GO community build,"Hello everyone!

Since we all share the same love for the game, i have tough of an idea that could help us all improve in it and also make it a bit more enjoyable. I am creating a discord server appropriate for anyone willing to improve, regardless of age, rank, sex, sexuality, religion ect... The focus of the discord will be on improving so hard critics coming towards a person's Gameplay will be encouraged IF its not personal or unappropriate. Conflicts will be settled in a matter of not who is right or wrong, but rather how could we continue to be productive and enjoy the game without anyone getting hurt or left out. An exception will be: If a certain person is not willing to be a normal and adequately behaving human being, then a quick solution of a kick will be taken. In any case emotional stability and good relations will be main priority over everything. At the end of the day the game is meant to be enjoyed, not polluted and burned out. I am currently getting back into the game after i quit at sitting on LEM for about half an year.  I would love for you to join the discord and help me create not only a non-toxic CS community, but also a place where people can find duos or full squads and enjoy the game the way it is meant to be. Weekly events would be created such as ""weekly aim check"" where we would get into a 1v1 tournament appropriate for ranks of course and also 5v5 matches to enjoy and learn from each other. I have a huge roaster of ideas concerning this community and i also do realise that there probably is another discord about the same thing or even a whole already built community. Regardless i want to make it happen. Of course rules will be set and they will need to be kept. 

&amp;#x200B;

All further information will be held in the discord i mentioned earlier. The discord will not be given away freely. In the case that you would like to join this new and fresh community. Simply write a comment and i will get in touch with you.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading it trough. I hope we can build an amazing new community together.",1,1584763974,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fm95yo/people_make_it_special_a_csgo_community_build/,GlobalOffensive,1
fm93qt,cs_tg,Stuck in Silver 1,"I have seen on this subreddit people stuck in Silver (especially Silver 1) but I am really confused on why I am not ranking up.

fm668o,SmulleSejr,Best editing program &amp; effects for montage??,"Hallo guys!
I am really interested in starting to edit some of my own clips into a montage.
My main concern is investing into some garbage.
My other problem is finding some good effects for the frags..

I am gonna try to explain some effects that i dont know what to search for::

A Blue energized kinda explosion across the screen with a impulsive Wave 

A Distortion Wave that Shakes the screen.



Do any of you guys have some ‚ÄúPackages that i Can buy or get for free? Remember i am interested in montage only effects. Not something i cant use at all ;)

anybody else experiencing very severe stuttering after updating their amd radeon software?

fm4lt7,TankerXS,Have knife deploy times been fixed?,"u/3kliksphilip made a video back in 2017 [checking deploy times for knives](https://youtu.be/3Svzuyi_vU8). [In short](https://i.gyazo.com/b91c8d5199b0bd2dfa274e0cd90a3d2d.png), the Falchion was the fastest (0.97 sec), the Bowie was slightly slower (1.07 sec) and the original Bayonet was the slowest (1.17 sec) compared to the rest which were 1 second.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious as to if Valve have fixed this issue, and I'd want a refresh of that data sheet with the newer knives (Navaja, Stiletto, Ursus, Talon, Classic, Nomad, Survival, Paracord and Skeleton). The testing should consider the alternative deploy animations that some knives have as well (Butterfly, Nomad, Survival, Paracord and Skeleton), and maybe could also attack patterns (slice slice, slice stab, stab slice and stab stab) to see if there are potential attack speed issues.

The mecanics that are now are kind of old and boring and are not so satisfying. I think that bringing new cool epic death animations that will show impact to the screen will spice thing up and make the game fun playing and satisfying while making kills. I do not know why no one saw this small detail that will bring big difference to the gameplay. Other thing to metion is new maps but i do not think so that this will happen all doe we need them they do not have to be perfect and with detail but they do need to be well thought and fun to play.,2,1584728933,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/fm00zk/cs_go_next_update_tip/,GlobalOffensive,1

Hey guys, I've been playing this game for a good while now but in the recent month I've suffered from really blurry skins, stickers, etc. And as it turns out I'm not the only one to have this problem. (While normally holding the skin everything is very blurry/pixelated but when inspected everything is fine) Have done everything I could imagine to correct it (uninstalling, Nvidia control panel, game settings, etc.) but it wont go back to the state where skins would look like something worth your money. Some of my friends have the same issue. How about you guys? Are you having the same problem and if so, do you have any fix for it?

flydvj,neubiiAUT,About the Cheaters,"So I've been Overwatching the past days due to quarantine and I am just asking myself here: What's the point? I don't get it. 

Let's leave the obvious spin botters out of this conversation, because reasons.

I want to focus on the Wallhacking and Aimbotting type. Why do you join a game for 25 to 45 minutes and just run around and looking straight a the wall at someone, just to toggle anyway? What's the point of this skillless waste of time, of no challenge whatsoever just to sit in a game, knowing everything upfront anyway and the only question you are going to ask yourself in the game is: is he going to peak or is he not? What do you get out of not playing the actual game?

I have heard from some that they get off by the raging opponent. I get that to some extent, but what if they don't say anything? 

What if you just sit in front of your monitor, spawn, run to a bombsite, aim at them through the wall and then toggle for EZ frags and that over and over and over again? What the actual fudge of brain fluids did you lose that your life came to this point? 

Don't give me this BS excuse you want to be Global, because you know and everyone else knows that you are a cheater and not a Global at all and sooner or later you are getting that Vacation stamp and all that time sitting there not challenging yourself whatsoever could have been invested in DMs or MMs for skill gains and experience. 

Anyway, 2/2/1/1 is the best stamp you are going to get. GGs",3,1584723351,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/flydvj/about_the_cheaters/,GlobalOffensive,1

flxwad,pajceee,Cheating in High Trust Factor matches,"First of all, yeah I already contacted Valve to their email opened for this cases, but since its second time since they introduced it and I got no answer to first mail, I wanna cry little bit more here too

I just played a match versus three blatant spinbotters.

Me and my team had nice streak of around 10 wins, after which 3 of us get Global Elite ranks, but also we **start** getting for one of our friends message¬†about lower trust factor, which was **never** issue before! Next thing that happened¬†is we ended in match with 3 cheaters. When I asked them why they doing it, they said this, what you can see in screenshot bellow. Apparently, all what they say is true, after 16-0 we all got kicked from server, and I cant download Demo of match, so I guess overwatchers cant download it as well.

How Valve gonna fight them?

Every game, it's against cheaters. Blatantly WH, AIm....

What the fuck am I supposed to do?

flxko7,TheProGamerWannabe,Competitive Platform or MM?,"So, here's a little story. My first rank was Gold Nova Master and my highest rank was Master Guardian Elite. But time after time, I had to move out and was my skill was getting worse and worse and when I was very inactive, my rank was gone. I tried to get my rank back, and I got Master Guardian I. After that, I deranked to Gold Nova Master. The problem is, my way of thinking is different than the other players when they try to get good. My logic is, that it would be better if I reach Global Elite and grind a lot and then start playing FACEIT. I was searching for advice from players and all of them said: ""That's your choice"" and the problem is, I can't decide, because I think FACEIT isn't worth it until I get a better rank and I do solo-queue.

flvtdg,Cristopher_Haste,Big performance drop with lots of insecurity about sensitivity,"Hi guys.

My issue is that I am very uncertain of my sensitivity and I believe that affects my performance in-game

The thing is that I feel like I can't find a sensitivity that works best for me. Because of that I began to drastically change sensitivity so I was playing 2.4 (400dpi) for a while, I changed to 2.2 or 1.5

I very like how low-sens feels but my arm seems incapable of flicking precisely, it looks so inaccurate. So even tho I feel good when playing, I often miss very easy shots including spraydowns and that hurts my game. I was playing 1.5 sens for about 1.5-2 months straight without changing it and didn't notice any significant improvement in regard of my arm flicking precision. I feel like my overall FPS mechanics allow me to play on a certain level regardless of sensitivity but I am unable of progressing or that progress merely comes. So when I get into slump I quickly get anxious about my sensitivity and change it.

Is there any way to find the perfect sensitivity for each individual or the progress that I was making was just not noticable for me.

I want to finally stick to one sensitivity and be sure of that so I could improve upon that.

In terms of aim-training routines I was practicing often (3-5 times a week and sometimes more), FFA HS, bots, recoil, etc.

TL;DR - I'm shit and can't find best sensitivity to stick to and grow individually as a player.",17,1584714138,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/flvtdg/big_performance_drop_with_lots_of_insecurity/,GlobalOffensive,1

Now as luck would have it, the enemy team had someone I knew who queued with three of his own friends, so I made a deal with him to tie the game, with us giving them 15 rounds first. 

We eventually got to 10-15, where two of them decided to take the win for themselves (as expected), but they gave us info on what they were doing so we managed to tie. 

While I'm disappointed that not all of them decided to honor the agreement, I'm still happy that we managed to turn the game into a good outcome. 

Dubai servers may be an absolute joke right now, but here's hoping for better.

flvrhi,sniffle04,Large discrepancy in freeze time length,"Freeze time in pro play is 20 seconds long to allow for replays etc. to happen on the broadcast.


Freeze time in levels below that, like general pugs (not really relevant but I'll still mention it), esea leagues up to advanced (unsure what time MDL uses) and other tournaments is 12 seconds. 


12 seconds vs 20 seconds is a massive difference gameplay wise when looking at the pro/semi-pro scene below the top broadcasted level. As an IGL currently playing in ESEA main and other competitive leagues/tournaments, the extra 8 seconds would be like night and day. I understand the reasoning behind why it was increased for the top level but surely with it creating a significant game play difference (More time to consider strategy, more time to discuss issues, more time to make sure people buy/drop correctly, more time to explain strategy on the fly etc) it should also be adopted in lower level competitive environments. It's similar to the old issue of 35 vs 45 second bomb plant and shorter round timer which was a big discrepancy between pro play and general play.


I for one would definitely like to see competitive play aligned across the board just like the changes to bomb and round timer.",9,1584713928,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/flvrhi/large_discrepancy_in_freeze_time_length/,GlobalOffensive,1

flqimj,MysticalC9000,People were too harsh about CS:GO becoming free to play.,"So I've reached about 150 hours on CS:GO ( I know it's not a lot but it's still something) and im almost about to reach lvl 21, after which I can get prime. 
I understand that people who paid for the game must have been pissed that it's now free to play and whatever they've paid for can be grinded and obtained for free. 
But, I have issues with the accusations of non prime being a hellhole full of hackers and smurfs. In all the games I've played, I've encountered a very negligible amount of hackers/smurfs. Maybe it's because of the server (i dont play on eu or na), but I felt people were being too loud and harsh on this matter.
Would love to hear differing opinions, so please go for it",32,1584687372,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/flqimj/people_were_too_harsh_about_csgo_becoming_free_to/,GlobalOffensive,1

flptc9,FocusCSGO,Sensitivity problem/question,"It feels like I am ""stuck"" to playing on low sensitivity (400 dpi 1.5-1.7) range. The problem with this is that I really enjoy the extra movement/freedom that a higher sensitivity gives (somewhere around the 400 dpi 2.5 range). However, whenever I try and switch it seems like I will never be able to get used to a higher sens just based on how much more poorly I play, my tracking is very jittery and my flicks always go too far. The maximum amount of time I have ever stuck with a higher sens is about 1-2 weeks which could be the issue. 

Basically, I am just wondering if I would really be able to completely get used to a higher sensitivity if I stuck with it for around 1-2 months and also if any of you have made a considerable jump from low -&gt; higher sensitivity successfully.",8,1584683711,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/flptc9/sensitivity_problemquestion/,GlobalOffensive,1

I was then randomly given the disconnected error where your game freezes so I restarted my game to rejoin. The game disappeared and there was no option to reconnect. I even waited a while but the match never appeared in my recent games history. I wasn't even given a ban for abandoning.

I then queued for another game and was met with a similiar experience. We had a cheater on our team (spinbotting in prime matchmaking) after about 4 rounds he said the game was boring and he was going to leave.

flnjnn,eebro,Who is Ayken?,"Sup,

There has been a lot of talk of s1mple flaming Ayken, and the community claiming he is being bullied. Now, personally, I think it's two guys who are equal strength in terms of words and mental talking shit to each other, but whatever. Here is my guide for you about who Ayken is, and what he has done, and who he has been involved with. By the end of it, you'll probably realize that if he was American, or a good player, he would have been investigated more throughougly by Valve, and not been allowed to play in the minor/major circuit. That is irrelevant, though, as he isn't skilled enough to ever get close to a minor. Okay, that's just shit talk, so feel free to ignore it.

Statistically Ayken is an above average top50 team level player. He has a consistent average of 76 adr vs top50 teams, but he has almost never played vs anyone deeper into the top30. He is better vs teams outside the top50. 2019 he only played a couple of maps, so it's safe to say he was inactive then. He has been moderately active from 2014 to 2018, and he seems to have came back for 2020. Now, you're probably going to say, he is a good player, right? No, he isn't. He hasn't won anything, and I'm not sure if he has been to LAN. He hasn't as far as HLTV is considered. But, he isn't terrible. He is probably very good in pugs, as esportsearnings say he has won a sizable sum just by playing pugs.

Enough of him as a player, lets look at some of the teams and stories he has been involved in.

Ayken 1 year ban from ESEA: 

[https://csgo.99damage.de/de/news/40469-esea-mit-bannwelle-xenn-dukiii-co-mit-sperre](https://csgo.99damage.de/de/news/40469-esea-mit-bannwelle-xenn-dukiii-co-mit-sperre)

TL;DR he basically played himself into the rank S getting boosted by cheaters.

Ayken maxbetting on his old team:

&gt;""Regarding to the accusation that original players from our team did place max bets on volgare it turns out wrong, as only the player ayken who played only a very few stand-ins for us and was not longer part of the team during the 'betting scandal' anymore made a high bet on volgare.""

[https://www.hltv.org/news/14174/toni-we-didnt-lose-on-purpose](https://www.hltv.org/news/14174/toni-we-didnt-lose-on-purpose)

&amp;#x200B;

His team getting dropped after players bet on their own games

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""We have released our CS:GO team with immediate effect. In yesterday's final of the Rising Stars Europe tournament, our players xall and syken clearly acted against the tournament rules by going onto CS:GO Lounge and betting on the game. This act lead to our subsequent disqualification from the tournament. We hereby dissociate ourselves from the misconduct of the players and apologize to the other participants and fans.""

&amp;#x200B;

His old team got accused of throwing and were dropped:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""r0bs3n and am0 involved in betting scandal on myRevenge in early 2015; dismissed from organisation and threatened with legal action. xall, ayken, and j1n were also previously on the team.""

[https://www.hltv.org/news/13929/myrevenge-in-betting-scandal](https://www.hltv.org/news/13929/myrevenge-in-betting-scandal)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you'd probably consider him the unluckiest player ever. You could give him the same excuse as Skadoodle, just being associated with people who did shitty things. However, Skadoodle was more thoroughly investigated, and was found sort of innocent. It was also just one game, while Ayken has been part of multiple different scandals with multiple different players. It can be coincidence, but this proves a) he isn't new to the scene b) he has proven to either associate with scammers/cheaters/scum of the earth c) he might be scum/cheater, but nothing conclusive, suspicious is the only correct description for him. 

I think the worst thing is that he has been linked to so many scummy players year over year, that it's not an accident.

&amp;#x200B;

Good thing is that he is apparently studying. That and above average stats vs low tier opponents are the only good things I can say about him. For the rest, well see for yourself. Personally, if you weigh up his behavior with what s1mple is accused of have been doing, this guy is the real deal. I'm not certain why Faceit/ESEA support someone like this financially, when he has been proven to game the system in many ways. However, I'm not saying he should be banned, just that these servide providers are making a willing move by ignoring his past deeds and associations. For me, that's fine, because competition &gt; status/ego/rumors/accusations/etc, but for others, especially Americans, I can see why you definitely wouldn't want to see someone like this associated with legitimate brands and professional players.

TL;DR Ayken has been suspicious, and has been associated with multiple scum-of-the-earth individuals. He is sort of legitimate right now, but don't fool yourself over him being some innocent victim that tox1c s1mple bullies.",4,1584673449,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/flnjnn/who_is_ayken/,GlobalOffensive,1
