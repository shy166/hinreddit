fsaxgy,AskScienceModerator,"AskScience AMA Series: Hello, Reddit! I'm Steven Munger, director of the University of Florida Center for Smell and Taste. I'm here to discuss the latest findings regarding losing your sense of smell as an early sign of COVID-19 - and what to do if it happens to you. Ask Me Anything!","Loss of smell can [occur with the common cold](https://doi.org/10.1159/000093758) and other viral infections of the nose and throat. Anecdotal reports suggest the loss of smell may be [one of the first symptoms](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/26/821582951/is-loss-of-smell-and-taste-a-symptom-of-covid-19-doctors-want-to-find-out) of COVID-19, at least in some patients. Doctors around the world are reporting that [up to 70% of patients who test positive for the coronavirus disease COVID-19](https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-symptoms-loss-smell-taste.html) - even those without fever, cough or other typical symptoms of the disease - are experiencing anosmia, a loss of smell, or ageusia, a loss of taste.

I'm here to answer your questions about these latest findings and answer any other questions you may have about anosmia, ageusia, smell or taste.

*Just a little bit of information on me:*

I'm a professor of the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Director of the Center for Smell and Taste, and Co-Director of UF Health Smells Disorders Program at the University of Florida.

I received a BA in Biology from the University of Virginia (1989) and Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Florida (1997). I completed postdoctoral training in molecular biology at Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 2000, where I remained until joining UF in 2014.

frsycs,TotallyNotMiaKhalifa,Are there drugs that can temporarily increase the permiability of the Blood Brain Barrier?,"Now, I will admit right off the bat I am not a medical professional nor am I medically trained in any way, so I may be asking the wrong sort of question, but my understanding is that the Blood Brain Barrier prevents large molecules and cells from entering the brain from the drug stream, including many drugs and elements of your immune response including immune cells and antibodies. This, for example, results in rabies being practically impossible to survive once developing symptoms as any treatment you receive won't be able to cross into the brain and fight the virus.  


Are there drugs out there that can temporarily increase the permeability of this barrier, allowing things like antibodies and immune cells to cross into your brain?

fqvz8o,ic3wuerfel,Why do i need 2gramms of proteine / kg of your bodyweight to gain muscles?,"I recently read, that it is advised to eat 2gramms of proteins per kg of your own bodyweight to build up your muscles. For normal people, who want to keep their weight, it is recommended to eat  0,8 gramms of proteins/kg of your bodyweight. 

As far as I understood it: Those 0,8g/kg are used to rebuild dead cells of your body for instance, so they keep you alive. I assume those extra 1,2 g/kg (2,0-0,8) are then used for the muscels to build up. Now i have some doubts in my calculations with a man of 60 kgs:
60kg x 1,2g/kg=72gramms of extra proteine a day, which should be converted into muscle mass.

Per year you would gain about 0,072g x 365days=26kg, which isn‘t the case in reallife. 
Even considering the biological value, I didn‘t find too much of a difference. Provided, that you eat enough calories so your body doesn‘t use your proteins as a source of energy. 
Why don‘t you gain those 26kgs in muscle mass?

TLDR; When you eat 26kgs worth of extra proteins per year, why don‘t you gain those 26kgs in muscle mass?",3,1585441032,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fqvz8o/why_do_i_need_2gramms_of_proteine_kg_of_your/,askscience,1

fp9lds,AskScienceModerator,"AskScience AMA Series: We are iNaturalist, educators who use our online social network to help students learn about nature. Ask Us Anything!","[iNaturalist](http://www.inaturalist.org/) is an online social network of people sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. It's also a crowdsourced species identification system and an organism occurrence recording tool. You can use it to record your own observations, get help with identifications, collaborate with others to collect this kind of information for a common purpose, or access the observational data collected by iNaturalist users.

With so many students sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, many educators and parents have turned to iNaturalist and [Seek by iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app), so not only will iNaturalist co-founder and co-director Ken-ichi Ueda answer questions here, we've also recruited a few educators who have used iNaturalist with their students. They are:

+ Mary Ford, National Geographic Society's Director of Professional Learning
+ Colleen Hitchcock, Associate Professor, Biology, Brandeis University
+ Anne Lewis, Special Projects Director South Dakota Discovery Center
+ Kelly L O'Donnell, Director of Science Forward, Macaulay Honors College, CUNY

We'll be on at 1 pm (ET, 17 UT), AUA!

forw8k,AutoModerator,"Ask Anything Wednesday - Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology","Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."". 

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3exo6p/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xiii/).
