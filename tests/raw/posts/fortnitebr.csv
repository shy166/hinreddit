fsogih,UltimatePortalMaster,I unlocked all of the future spy game upgrades... I definitely think this was a accident. (Spoilers?),"So after playing spy games for a long while I realized that I was still getting points and unlocking things.

In this case. All of a sudden I see new upgrades that I haven’t seen before. Including but not limited to... Dancing healing allies and self, better fire rate for heavy AR and automatic sniper. (Those last two are pretty broken by the way.) And others.

So I said we have some good stuff to look forward too but at the same time I feel like this is definitely not on purpose. It only gets to 33 For both sections so see if it works for you guys as well. I’m still going to report it because it’s the right thing to do and... oh my goodness.",18,1585699184,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsogih/i_unlocked_all_of_the_future_spy_game_upgrades_i/,FortNiteBR,6

fso96l,CasperElshao,"Something that is a far bigger problem than ""forced crossplay or Sbmm""","Some of my friends are on lower end PC's or even consoles. With every update, the game just gets heavyer untill a point where they have 5 second lag spikes or entire parts of the map not loading in.

This is why i bought a PC back in like season 8, because my old Ps4 didn't run more than like 45 fps in creative and 30 in BR.

A friend of mine who is playing on a decently old I3 processor, and gtx 960 was forced to quit when this season dropped. I was even playing winter royale with him last season and his FPS was somewhat stable 100. Now entire buildings aren't loading in for him and he's just glitching around.

fsm8pg,sprendax,EPIC DISCUSSION! Fortnite Could Have Saved Kobe's Life? (F),"Greetings and good evening gamers!

I was gaming with my epic squad today after the new update and we realized something just absolutely epic.

THE NEW HELICOPTER PAD COULD'VE SAVED KOBE'S LIFE!!!! Kobe (F) would have definitely lived if he jumped out of his crashing helicopter (KOBE!) (F) and used a crash pad to cushion the fall! Honestly at this rate, if Fortnite could have saved Kobe's life, they can stop Le Corona Virus!!! 

I hope by the time we are able to play the Midas challenges, Fortnite has stopped the spread of Le Corona Virus and cured the world! (Also eliminate all minecraft players XD!!^(minecraft bad fortnite good))

fsm4n1,ItsRyandude5678,How Epic could implement the Heavy Shotgun into Chapter 2 - TL: DR,"**NOTE:** ***This is a TL: DR post. If you dislike long posts or do not currently have the time to read one, I suggest coming back later when you're available to do so. You have been warned! Now, onto the post.***

So, this is something I've had on my mind for a while now. Pretty much since the start of this feature in Chapter 2. And that is the sidegrade system. Whereas of right now, the only sidegrade available is transforming the Purple/Gold Assault Rifle **(SCAR)** into the Purple/Gold Heavy Assault Rifle. So, I think this feature with the Pump Shotgun and the Heavy Shotgun would fit perfectly. Due to the fact, the similarities are identical, and it would make sense with the current position of the Pump.

Here is what I mean by that!

* ***Heavy Shotgun is the same concept as the Heavy AR. A Heavy version of the weapon you're switching from. But instead of the Heavy weapon being the stronger, yet slower weapon, the Heavy Shotgun would be the further range faster weapon, but being a tad weaker than the current Pump. Especially with the Purple/Gold Pump. With a few stat changes, this could work perfectly with the meta and current Pump Shotgun.***
* ***Due to the fact that people are disliking the lower-end Pump since the start of Chapter 2, having the option to sidegrade to the Heavy would be perfect. As you can still use an almost identical version but feel like you're doing a lot more work if you aren't lucky with the Pump and its current state. Especially if you dislike the feel of the Tactical Shotgun and want to still use a form of Pump.***
* ***The fact that the Heavy currently has a blue Rare version of the weapon in Spy Games, all Epic would have to do to make this work is to make a worse Uncommon/Common version of the weapon. Possibly with a new model design as well? Either that or they'd make it like the SMG where you cannot upgrade above Blue anymore. In this case, below Purple or Blue for the Heavy sidegrade.***

The Heavy is also just a very missed weapon in the community right now. Being in my opinion, probably the most missed shotgun outside of the Combat Shotgun. Which I doubt Epic would bring back without major changes due to being overpowered even with the nerfs made to it. But in my opinion, the Heavy, unlike the Combat, would fit perfectly into the current meta. Especially with the current Pump and the sidegrade concept. It's like it's **MEANT** to be and like it's **MEANT** to come back. At this point, I feel it'd be more of a missed opportunity if anything. But tell me what you think. Do you want to see the Heavy Shotgun return? And if so, do you think this is the perfect way to do so? I personally feel like it's meant to be with all these points. And I'll be more surprised if they don't do this at some point. But I'm excited to see your feedback on this topic in the comments!",13,1585691335,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsm4n1/how_epic_could_implement_the_heavy_shotgun_into/,FortNiteBR,3

fsm1z5,Flamingpaper,Why Zapper Traps should come back,"With the addition of the Crash Pad, and thus essentially the Bouncer/Jump Pad, I think it would be a good idea to bring back the Zapper Trap (or add a similar version that isn't the Proximity Mines) as another throwable ""trap"", if the Damage Trap is going to remain vaulted. 

I know it wasn't good, but I loved using the Zapper Trap in Season X, and I get why it was vaulted, but I feel it could be a cool addition to be another throwable trap like item, similar to the Crash Pad. 

If someone comes into you builds, the lack of Damage Trap means you have no protection other than the weapons in you inventory. The Proxomity Mine also hurts you and destroys builds, which makes it a bad substitute for the Damage Trap from that standpoint. The Zapper Trap, however, also throwable and can damage the opponent in your builds, while not risking yourself anymore, and then you cam use your guns.

The Zapper Trap was terrible, but I feel that it could be better if the initial shot came out maybe 1 second faster and did extra damage (maybe 75), then continued doing 50 damage as normal. I feel it had a lot of potential and being bad just made it unappealing to most players, and thus was never used outside of Team Rumble",16,1585691088,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsm1z5/why_zapper_traps_should_come_back/,FortNiteBR,7

fsm0fi,Flashpdv,My concerns and maybe some possible solutions about leveling up all the way to level 300,"I just wanted to star of saying that I think that level 300 to get golden agent peely is way too much. I feel that the only way that you’re going to get it is if you’re a streamer or youtuber and it’s what you do full time. As a 14 year old boy I feel that it’s going to be impossible for me to get it because I have my online classes (because of the COVID-19) and only 2 days ago I got to level 100. Something that I propose is that you make it so that when you reach level 100 every the amount of XP it takes to level up is 40,000 or 50,000. This would allow the average player that doesn’t spend all their time grinding XP to actually get the peely. Another proposal is that you make it like the past battle pass challenges and that the challenges stayed until you complete them. So instead of getting to level 300 in one season you would have to level up 300 times until you complete it. This would actually allow all of the players who want to get it (and bought the battle pass) get it. So please epic. I’m sure that most people would really appreciate it and I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one who feels this way.

Not only that, but for most people and even for some streamers, getting gold peely will be impossible this season since it ends on April 30th. My suggestion is that after you hit level 100 you earn xp at a supercharged rate (4x rate). You would still have to grind to get gold peely, but it wouldn't be basically impossible like it is now. With the way it is now you could basically have to buy up to tier 100 and STILL have to grind fortnite at least 5 hours a day to get gold peely. Hopefully someone at Epic HQ reads this and is able to make a change to the xp system.",14,1585686867,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fskq5s/about_xp_progression/,FortNiteBR,2

fskg99,goingdeeeep,EPIC: Please consider Overtime Challenges for Maya,"I love the idea of Maya, but am a little disappointed that we have an infinite number of options for scarf color, but only 4 options for hair color or style.  

Please consider allowing people to ""unlock"" Maya's hair during Overtime, and allow as much flexibility for hair color as you do for scarf color.  People could have a pink-haired Maya or blonde Maya or a grey-haired Maya or any other color they wanted...making her that much more ""ours"".

Further - I'd love to see more hairstyles (and an unlocking for those who picked already) for Maya during Overtime.  More than clothing, it's her actual physical features that can make her feel more unique.  Skin tone and eye color would also go a long way here.

However, if more styles aren't an option - please consider giving us more Hair Color options during Overtime.  I think we'd all have Maya's that felt more unique this way.

fsk7tt,AntonioliGamer,Sorana's backstory theory,"NOTE: I don't believe Sorana is the result of some weird fusion between Cameo and Chic.



As everybody (or atleast everybody) knows, Sorana was the last season's secret skin. But who is Sorana? Secret skins usually have important participations in the story, so here's a theory I've been thinking about…



Sorana is actually a Ghost agent. In fact she can be considered a double agent but not in this case, I think she's the one responsible by the agency recruitments. She would have joined Alter, convinced the members that she was a much better leader and stole Alter from Chaos Agent. Now that he hates her, he's living somewhere and stalking her as can be seen on Chaos Rising loading screen. Later on, she united both, Alter and Ego to create the Agency, a organization to protect the island where only the best of the best can be part of (like a super heroes league). Chaos Agent then re-rise it's empire and hire some new agents, like Brutus and Tina. Some volunteers also agree in being part of his experiments and eventually being part of Shadow.",3,1585685291,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsk7tt/soranas_backstory_theory/,FortNiteBR,2

fsjzqf,woomyinavroomy,"Epic, please fix the Nintendo Switch version of the game, it’s unplayable.","I've been a player since day 1 of the Switch release. It used to run perfectly, no issues. Now is a different story.

 You can't even build without dropping frames, and I don't mean one or two frames, I mean 10-20, which is a big issue when the Switch is capped at 30fps. I'm not saying that the Switch has to be 60fps, because I remember something coming out saying that you just couldn't because the Switch's Tegra chip wasn't powerful enough. That's fine honestly, but is it too much to ask for a constant 30? Or hey, if you can boost it to 45 or something that would be fantastic since you can now over clock the switch.

The game freezes constantly. More often its when I'm fighting people. This is especially a big issue because I can't defend myself! 

Also as someone who enjoys buying cosmetics, it's not the most amazing thing to have the issue where 80% of the skins are Ramirez. At this point this is more of a tiny issue. But I would really appreciate it if I could flex some skins I have. It’d be cool if we could have physics back too.

Epic, please fix the Nintendo Switch version. People said that when we started playing with mobile players that they had an unfair advantage. But in reality, it was us. We don't have auto fire, they have more then 10fps during fights, and their games aren't constantly freezing.",11,1585684596,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsjzqf/epic_please_fix_the_nintendo_switch_version_of/,FortNiteBR,2

fsilhq,PokeJody2258,What is up with the story this season?,"So, both this season and last season sorta made sense... but just for their respective season. I enjoy connecting the story (the main reason I play), and last season seems to have nothing to do with last season

Last season, EGO crash landed to this new island and set up bases around the place. Soon after, look alikes from “ALTER” show up (not sure if we know how) and start to make their way around and making weird deals and taking things, and we see EGO was always watching them. EGo discovers some of their plans and discovers the virus. ALTEr builds a Sludge army for whatever reason (taking over the island I’d assume) and then we constantly see them working. EGO manages to stop their plans at the Dam and then we don’t see much more. We get purple and golden variants of characters (gold is obvious, not sure about purple). We also randomly had Fusion and the Fusion Orb, but those... had no purpose? 

Now we have this season, with the fence taking over and there is two sides, Shadow and Ghost. Are both sides part of the agency, or are they separate entities? Why do the members who were asked to join the agency have to join a side? Is peely going to ultimately be the savior given that he is a double agent and has a cabin where he is making plans for something? (Did he go crazy? He seems to be setting up bears and gnomes. Do bears and gnomes represent the two sides?). And what is Midas up to? We now have hatched that lead to an underground Doomsday room where I assume Midas and the agency are working on the doomsday device, but also where they will hide when they set it off. So The Agency are bad guys? Why did Journey from EGO join? Why do Ghost and Shadow use EGO and ALTER’s logos, and where did those two sides even go? What connection do Midas, Oro, Wrath, and Reaper have (they all have the same scar over the eye)

So in short, how do these two stories connect? Will this season make a connection in your opinion, or will it come way later? I definitely have my thoughts, but I’m curious to hear yours.",11,1585680236,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsilhq/what_is_up_with_the_story_this_season/,FortNiteBR,2

These bounce pads close that gap and allow someone a chance to counter someone overbuilding and stops this 20 story tower meta that we are currently playing in.

fsh4v8,ttopshagger,Sweats/Competitive players didn't make the game bad. Epic Games did.,"I find it really weird when people (mostly on this subreddit) say stuff like ""Sweats are the reason this game is dying"" or ""I wish epic games would stop catering to the competitive crowd""

Epic games doesn't cater to competitive. with Arena being overrun by Mythical Weapons, AI bosses, Heavy Snipers, and a lack of any real tournaments. Epic Games clearly doesn't give a shit. 

The only good things to happen to competitive in the last couple of months were the seperated loot pools (which lasted 1 season), and the removal of Legacy (which was already OP to begin with. But I don't agree with epic removing it, they should've just nerfed it hard)

wether or not the community likes to say this, It isn't the ""sWeAtS"" fault, maybe point the fingers at the people who are actually causing the issues, instead of pointing fingers at the people who kill you often. And you can scream ""good player bad"" on the subreddit everyday, but this is the fault of Epic Games and their terrible SBMM system.

50% of this would be resolved by adding seperated loot pools from Arena and Pubs, not crippling peoples building skills or adding editing delay like the vocal part of this subreddit likes to stupidly recommend. And the other 50% would be resolved by not removing FCP or SBMM, but by making SBMM a better (working) system. 

in conclusion, stop saying sweats ruined the game. also stop calling people toxic if you use the word ""sweat"" because you're not much better.",19,1585675658,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsh4v8/sweatscompetitive_players_didnt_make_the_game_bad/,FortNiteBR,2

fsgyen,Cas_per,Fortnite Appreciation,"I wasn’t sure how or where to say this, but I have been playing Call of Duty: Warzone recently with my little brother, and it is reminding of the times I began playing Fortnite with him. I live a few hours away from my parents and brother, so we primarily communicate through text message or gaming/voice chat. One morning in January 2018, I received a call letting me know my brother had attempted suicide the previous night and I needed to come home to see him. He was hospitalized for several weeks, and I went home several times to visit during that time. When he was released from the hospital, he was permitted to play video games for small periods of time, and Fortnite BR was just becoming popular. We both downloaded and played every night for months. I was able to communicate and “check up on him” every day, without making things uncomfortable or weird for him by having direct conversations about what was happening. As I sit here and type this post, I am truly appreciative of the positive effect the game had in my life and my brothers life. We would game for hours a day, and I could take comfort in the fact that he was getting better and everything would be okay. I know the game receives a lot of flame for its updating, lack of developer communication, balancing issues with weapons, etc., but I just hope the Fortnite team sees this and knows how truly appreciative I am that they created a world where my brother and I could chat about life while always looking for that next Victory Royale. We may not play much anymore, but I won’t forget the time periods we played.

fsgt1t,anthonyboggs,Current Fortnite,"I took a while off of this game at the beginning of chapter 2 because Forced crossplay ruined the game for me, as I play on Xbox. During the time I wasn’t playing I missed the game a lot and missed what It used to be. I told myself I wasn’t going to play until they removed forced crossplay but I couldn’t wait that long because I loved this game and as of last week I started playing again. 
As everyone knows the massive debate on aim assist and that hatred mouse and key board players have for controller players is insane. Controller players just get trashed on for trying to enjoy the game because we have aim assist. Now epic games made all these changes to the controller settings and it just seems like playing on a console or controller is starting to be forbidden, and I’m forced to feel bad about playing controller. Why can’t the M&amp;KB players just not complain for once, why can’t everyone just enjoy the game. It’s bad enough console and controller is forced to play against M&amp;KB, but it’s not our fault, and now it’s even harder to compete against them with al these new changes. 
I can’t thank epic enough for creating this game because it’s one my all time favorites and I know this post will probably get lost and know no one will care, but until something changes I’m done playing this game for good.",7,1585674610,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsgt1t/current_fortnite/,FortNiteBR,2

fsggzi,Heavyduty35,Is there a Kingsman Crossover?,"I know that they added the Kingsman umbrella. I am super psyched about this, and as I look at it, it is clearly the one from the movie, with the see-through impact spots and everything.

What I am wondering is, is this an actual crossover? They definitely called it KINGSMAN, not spy umbrella. Is the term Kingsman not tied to the movie/comic book series?

My first thought was that this and the new bounce pad thing (the falling protection item. It’s on the tip of my tongue) are for April Fools, but it’s a day early.

Just a thought, maybe there is a copyright written somewhere? Similar to the end of any movie or game trailer. Look at the Season 2 trailer, and at the end, it says Marvel/Deadpool, belongs to... is this anywhere for Kingsman in Fortnite? Just a thought.

Is this an actual, official, licensed crossover?",0,1585673557,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsggzi/is_there_a_kingsman_crossover/,FortNiteBR,0

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQF-Wv6LBCIw69p3EEAsV5xCLE9KoB3D/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQF-Wv6LBCIw69p3EEAsV5xCLE9KoB3D/view?usp=sharing)

I made a Google Doc listing every unlock able tech found in the Spy Games all of them are sorted its more clear to list all of them! I sorted them in 3 categories : Weapons / Consumables / Tech.

Previously I made something a lot similar but on a post like this reddit. Weirdly when I did it for Ghost it got deleted for account selling... even tho the Shadow post didn't... it was just the same thing... Weird so instead I'm putting it into a google doc. I will update it once you stuff is out. 

Screenshots :

[Every weapons for Ghost. When in-game and you reach level 26, you can see that level 27 is a Suppressed Sniper.](https://preview.redd.it/36gb7g8g91q41.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57a040f2f2f0353498254afb6283a6e1952a3a2c)

&gt;Every weapon in the game **\[WIP\]**

I don't really know how to name this one. It's just a spreadsheet where I list VERY single weapon that was in the game even exclusive ones like the Infinity Blade and on top of that I'm putting each stats with them (damage, reload time, ...) to compare them with its other rarities. I haven't created a tab called Theoretical Guns, this is where I create a rarity for a gun that doesn't have one. For example, a grey Drum Gun &amp; see what the stats looks like! Again this in WIP so things might change

fsf0c0,shuski19,Skill Based Matchmaking will be the downfall of this game,"I've put time into getting to a competent level. I consider myself a pretty decent player. Not quite good enough to be in that Competitive player type of stratosphere but pretty decent. Back before this mess, this level of skill would have allowed me to go into pubs and have my way, pub stomp if you will. I know this seems mean and unfair to a less skilled player but think about what put this game on the map. It was watching YouTube videos of 20 bombs and thinking, if I practice enough I can do that too, it was a balance of being in awe of a player but also knowing that skill was within your grasp with enough effort. 

Flash forward to present day. What does practise and time get you? A lobby of players that have done exactly the same thing you have waiting for you around every corner. I'm not one to stray away from competition but isn't a pub game suppose to be casual? Isn't exactly what I just describe what only Arena should be?

I feel for the new player to the game that would be subjected to this but at the same time at what cost do you protect that new player? Don't forget there is a game mode called Team Rumble that is perfect for new players to practise. For me I find the game less enjoyable every day because there is no reward for the time I've put in. I could play this game all day when I'm getting Elims, getting wins, having a good time, but that isn't a reality when your forced to play with 99 other people who have done everything you have to get to a certain level of play. I know Epic is trying to avoid losing every new player they get by not throwing them to the wolves but when does keeping a new player come at the cost of losing several loyal players?

Apologies for the winded post but it needed to be said.

fseypi,JadedDrama,What I think the hatches are for.,"Hello everyone, happy Tuesday. Today, the 12.30 update came out, with one of the new changes being 5 things added near the Agency underwater, with the codenames being Doomsday Device, Doomsday Door, and Doomsday Hatch in the files, which hints towards the apocalypse happening. Now, I think that there will be a live event, which will happen on the Saturday before season 3 in this scenario. Anyways

Now before I talk about this, I want to talk about what the things are made up of. Now, It could be made up of metal, but I think it is made up of starlite, a material I'll discuss later on. Now, let's that during the event that somewhere a nuclear bomb appears and it hits the dam near Hydro 16, because something has to happen to it. Lets assume the radius is large enough to cover the whole area of the Agency, and that is were starlite comes in. 

Now, according to British chemist Maurice Ward, starlite is a material that is capable of withtanding and insulating any amount of extreme heat, which yes, does include a nuclear blast. Now, lets assume the explosion's temerature is 100,000,000 degrees Celsius, or 180,000,032 degrees Farenheit, and is capable to elimate any player in the explosion. So I think that if the material of the things (what are they even called), is starlite, then those inside the things will survive. Now, lets say the bomb has the energy of 16 kilotons, the equivalent of the nuke used to hit Hiroshima at the end of World War ll. Then, the explosion happens, we play the rest of the season in this wasteland, downtime begins for Season 3, which will have a theme of the apocalypse.

Now I don't think this is going to happen, but if it does, I called it. What do you think of this possibility?  Do you think there is going to be a live event this season, and if so why? Thanks so much ladies and gentlemen, and I'm out!",3,1585668684,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fseypi/what_i_think_the_hatches_are_for/,FortNiteBR,2

fse72v,B_scuit,Theory: what might happen concerning the doomsday devices around The Agency.,"If you didn't know, in the most recent update these 'doomsday devices' were place in the lake surrounding the Agency. It's hard to tell what they are, but it looks like they could be shield generators or possibly rocket boosters. I have a few guesses of what might happen during this season's event.

1: A rocket is launched by Shadow from the smaller tunnel (the one with the wind) at the Grotto. This missile  is aimed towards the Agency. Luckily for Ghost, these doomsday device had been placed in the lake in case of  an attack by Shadow. The devices are activated, and a large shield is created around the Agency, similar to the shields added in Season X (vaulted soon afterwards). The missile hits the shield and explodes, leaving the Agency untouched but damaging the surrounding area, including Risky and possibly Salty.

2: The rocket is launched at the Agency, but instead of creating a protective shield, Midas decides to active the doomsday devices, somehow launching the Agency into the air and creating a floating island, like Kevin's Loot Lake island. The rocket hits the ground where the Agency once stood, creating a large crater. It could potentially Risky, Salty and other nearby landmarks.

I feel like the first theory is more likely to happen, but a floating island in Chapter 2 would be very fun. What do you think?",6,1585666108,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fse72v/theory_what_might_happen_concerning_the_doomsday/,FortNiteBR,3

fsd9ux,JackFrost___,For the past week it feels like there’s been a nerf on aim assist (Linear),"Title pretty much sums it up.

I took about a week or two off because it seemed like everytime I was about to start fighting someone the frames would drop. When I came back on Thursday, it doesn’t seem as though it slows down at all when you aim at someone. I also got a new controller, so that may play a small role but I feel as though it’s deeper than that. 

I’ve seen a post saying to restore your settings to default and redoing them. Seems like it could be a troll, idk if that’s legit or not. Has anyone else felt them same? What have you done?

I'm playing fortnite for like 2 years now and I still have since season 8 ping problem. My ping is about 0-20, but sometimes it just goes to 100, then 200 etc.. sometimes even to 1000.. When I was checking my internet on speedtest website, it was 7, but in game, it was 700. I was trying to use Nvidia NOW, but it is worse. My pc is connected with ethernet cable to my internet connection. I live in middle eu (Czech Republic), near to one big city. While I'm playing Fortnite I have turned on only Fortnite. Not even Discord, or google.

fsd6ig,DistinctIllusion,Fortnite X CoD: Zombies,"
Note: I’m just a fan of both games, I don’t actually expect this to happen. I had an idea, I THINK that it’s pretty good, and I hope someone notices. However, if by some magical coincidence this does happen, do it around Halloween, okay Epic? Feedback is appreciated, and if you have any crossover ideas I should work on, that’d be wonderful. Also, when I say “Stun” in this concept, I mean lower X and Y sensitivity for a short duration, and no ADS. Plus, slight blurring of the screen, and I mean SLIGHT. For Panzers however, I mean they can’t move.

Story:
Dempsey, Nikolai, Takeo and Richthofen re-unite with Jonesy and Peely in the basement of a house in Salty Springs. The Summoning Key falls into the hands of Jonesy, who releases the Shadowman after being tricked into thinking his past discretions to Peely would be forgiven.

So this makes me think that Deadpool might also have another unlock-able style/styles, orr... it could just be a bug :(

fscpjq,CameronTheMemelord,A theory about the 4 new dome-like structures around The Agency.,"So last nights updated added 4 new dome-like structures around The Agency. Personally, I think that each dome is holding some sort of missile. I theorize that at the end of the season they will open up and the 4 missiles will go to The Grotto, The Shark, The Rig (what's left of it that is), and the Yacht.   


But why does this happen? Well as everyone knows at the time of writing, the Grotto and the Rig are both shadow bases. What if the Shark and the Yacht (that is if Deadpool's Yacht will be considered a Shadow base) also turn into Shadow Bases? Due to this, Midas, fearing that the Agency is next to be taken over,  has built these missile silos and plans to destroy the Grotto, Rig, Shark, and Yacht in order to save his own life and the Agency.",7,1585660517,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fscpjq/a_theory_about_the_4_new_domelike_structures/,FortNiteBR,1

fsc79y,ArtiBlanco,Epic doesn't care about console anymore.,"\[For context, I play on PS4, so I can't vouch if this happens on XBox or Switch\]

This last update has only served to destroy my faith in Epic even more. I'm not going to rant about sweats or building or stuff like that, I'm going to list everything Epic has broken in this update (and stuff from previous updates that STILL haven't been fixed).

* Controllers no longer vibrate when you take damage
* Constant stuttering/freezing
* Horrendous textures on both the world and skins. Skins were broken since last update, this one made the world look like Minecraft
* Personal settings (i.e. ""Mature Language Filter"", ""Hide Linked Account Names"") will sometimes reset without notifying the player
* Cutscenes replaying when launching the game (battlepass video when opening BR, all character scenes when entering their rooms). The character scenes also cannot be skipped
* THEY REMOVED AIM ASSIST. EPIC CONFIRMED TO ONLY CARE ABOUT PC SWEATS.

There's probably more to this but it's what I can remember at the moment. I really wanted to try out the Kingsman Umbrella and see the new style for Rabbit Raider but I had to quit out halfway through my first Team Rumble match because the stuttering and lack of vibration was horrendous. Epic NEEDS to do something otherwise the game will literally be unplayable and nobody will want to play anymore.",35,1585658419,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsc79y/epic_doesnt_care_about_console_anymore/,FortNiteBR,1

fsbtgk,Goose-Stomper,What happened to fortnite after the world cup?,"Ever since the world cup ended and season X started, fortnite has been on straight nose dive. Sbmm and forced cross play have made the game I love such a joyless experience. 

Console is borderline unplayable unless you have the ps4 pro or Xbox one X, and even then it’s still at such a huge disadvantage to PC. We don’t even have the option to lower graphics or turn off shadows to help with performance. I know epic isn’t going to change anything now, but before season X they weren’t like this. I miss the old epic that released patch notes and kept the game new and fresh every week, and ultimately seemed to genuinely care about the community, but that epic is gone now. I don’t even want to get into how they tanked the competitive scene. 

It just sucks to see such a great game being one big patch from being returned to its former glory, and that’s what gives me hope for fortnite. However, it seems more and more likely that it will never be what it once was and it honestly sucks that epic took the game in this direction.",10,1585656680,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsbtgk/what_happened_to_fortnite_after_the_world_cup/,FortNiteBR,1

fsbnsn,Foxtrot1124,Kingman x Fortnite,"**\*WARNING\* Long post, scroll to the end for a TLDR summary! :)**

The Kingsman umbrella was just added to Fortnite, and the doomsday protocol hatches were placed all around the agency. Harry used Kingsman umbrella in the famous bar scene in the first movie, and the entire movie plot was to stop the villain from activating the doomsday protocol, and killing everyone apart from the wealthy in a bunker (possibly redacted, or any of the other bunkers across the map) Kingsman is also a copyrighted name and a spy franchise, making it extremely likely that Fortnite would be planning a crossover. By now we know a Kingsman event will 99% be happening in Fortnite, what does this mean for the season? well, there are 3 known crossovers in the works right now, Kingsman, Travis Scott, and, of course, Deadpool, Deadpool and Kingsman crossovers have already started, so that means it is extremely likely that the Travis Scott event will be moves to next season, because three events in the space of 30 days is impossible and the current speed Fortnite is adding content. So Travis Scott, out, sad, but this does also most likely mean we will have a live even, in game event, or both this season! Because with three huge things happening around the map (Kingsman, Deadpool, and Shadow vs Ghost... also the whole Oro thing) means we will be getting an event!

**TLDR: Kingsman umbrella added to game, Kingsman is a copyrighted name meaning that Fortnite would have to be planning a crossover or they would most likely be sued, because of the addition of this knowledge, we can assume that Travis Scott will be moved to next season, but we will also most likely be getting a live &amp; in-game event this season.**",11,1585655973,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsbnsn/kingman_x_fortnite/,FortNiteBR,1

fsb6c7,IHateRiiky,Seperate Competitive Fortnite from Casual Fortnite,"No hate towards Fortnite, I freaking love the game, but I believe the reason for the decrease in Fortnite content, or people just playing is the the lack of boundaries from its competitive scene to its casual scene. Arena and Pubs are legit the same. I mean even Arena has mythic weapons and the agents when Team Rumble doesn’t which seems weird to me. Skill based matchmaking in pubs doesn’t make sense because why should someone have to be forced to play so hard for the reward of nothing. Arena I could understand, but in pubs? Fortnite needs to bring back that state where it was fun to play and you’d just hop onto pubs and find random kids and help them get their first win, and once in a while you’d find that TTV sweat and die to him. Separate competitive Fortnite from casual Fortnite. I just wanted to get my idea out, again I love the game, but I hate to see the decrease.",5,1585653607,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsb6c7/seperate_competitive_fortnite_from_casual_fortnite/,FortNiteBR,1

fsb3wn,bradenboiii,I Feel Bad For Epic,"This is just my opinion, so if you disagree let me know what you guys think.

Recently many competitive players have been quitting Fortnite for many different reasons but the main few have been things such as “Fortnite is boring now, Fortnite is too competitive, Fortnite isn’t competitive anymore, etc”. Back in Season 1-9 Epic was pushing out weekly updates each adding new weapons and features. Many pro players didn’t like this and complained so Epic decided to *cater to the pros* and make Chapter 2 Season 1 very simple and not add very much. 

When they did this, those very same pros got mad at Epic for being “lazy” and calling the game “boring”. Many pros also complained that Epic didn’t care about competitive when they changed the entire *FORMULA OF THE GAME* for them. 

In Chapter 2 Season 2 Epic met in the middle. Instead of Weekly Updates/no updates and has been giving us updates every other week. Now pros are complaint AGAIN. Every time they add something to keep the game feeling fresh they complain about it. Other pros like Ninja are saying the game is boring. 

Basically what I’m saying is Epic can not win in this situation. No matter what they do half of the community will complain while the other half won’t. I don’t have any idea how they can win, but if you do I’d love to hear it.",13,1585653269,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsb3wn/i_feel_bad_for_epic/,FortNiteBR,1

fsajk5,TheBajaBabe,Xbox One Bugs Since Patch 12.30?,"I have played Fortnite since the beginning of season four. I have never, ever since playing had so many bugs in this aspect-- all in combat.  
After downtime ended I hopped into squads with some friends, all of whom play on PC. I am not so fortunate, I've played on console the entire time I have played. They have had zero issues with the game. Nothing wrong with the new items, nothing wrong with the audio, perfectly fine.  
I, however, am struggling severely.   
In battle I cannot tell that I am getting shot. At all. I have zero sound of shot impact, my health doesn't change... until it's too late. As in less than 20hp. After I die completely and begin to spectate my teammates, I can hear the impact shots when they get shot. I can see their health go down. But after reboot I am back to not being able to tell. My in game character does not react to shots (i.e. body jolting slightly when hit), there are no sounds of shots hitting me (we've all been blanked with a sniper at this point; we know what a shot sounds like-- I get nothing), my health doesn't decrease in increments, it's a sudden loss of 180+ damage (and a grey AR or green pistol) is not causing that damage in under one second when I have 200hp).  
Because I'm on Xbox One, I don't really have a clear way of showing this but all of my friends have heard my frustration.   
Also, I know, ""vibration is ass,"" but I have played every game since I was very young with vibration on. It's barely working since the update. I've seen a few people tweet about similar issues as far as vibration, but nobody having any issues with taking damage like this. I'm frustrated as the game is practically unplayable for me at the moment, and I generally play at least 6-8 hours a day, especially since this pandemic started.   


Is anybody else having issues? Am I alone? Should I reinstall the game? I've restarted the game twice as well as my console with no resolution. I had a friend suggest a hard reset on the console but I really don't want to have to unless absolutely necessary..",32,1585650387,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fsajk5/xbox_one_bugs_since_patch_1230/,FortNiteBR,1

fs9m9b,Biscuit_CR,The Nintendo switch needs an big (A really big) improvement,"Sorry about the long rant but here we go
Hope this gets attention for the epic community and most switch players who understands it.


1. Optimization and performance 

Long ago during season 4-5 the switch was getting some love and improvement which help a lot back then lower graphics was the best thing there was for the switch and right now with the useless improve graphics during season x was a Huge disaster lower frames, buggy and glitches most of the time and even box fights with someone the frames tends to stutter which sucks.

What you guys can actually help have an option to disable lower shadows or have a big patch in helping the switch in improve frames,graphics wise, or decreasing high geometry and anti anti aliasing with the switch right now is failing very hard. Or maybe decreasing graphics 




2. Frame drops and stutters 

The switch right now when going to lazy lake the frames start to fall hard with the reflections on the solar panels being ver useless and people landing at the same time or even jumping off from the battle the frames start to drop even the playing in team rumble the switch starts to fail hard or even a different game mode such operation dropout the game becomes hard to play and sucks really bad. Same with stutters once in while the game starts to stutter like crazy no matter where you going either the starts to freeze mostly.

Being the rant being over you don’t have to agree with everything the switch could help but actually helping the switch community and help improve because the console is a very bad spot hopefully I could the message starts to spread and HOPEFULLY the epic team could decide in helping or even figure this out.",4,1585645421,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fs9m9b/the_nintendo_switch_needs_an_big_a_really_big/,FortNiteBR,1

fs95cu,M3assasinTC,A theory about the end event and the rocket event from season 4,"So while I was waiting for Fortnite downtime to end I was watching PlayStationGrenades lore video about all the live events from 3 to 9 and realized something, we know the rifts are cracks through space and time right? Well maybe we know where the first rocket went, it jumped through time to the end event. Maybe it’s possible that each rocket is from a different point in time along the main timeline. Visitor is season 4s time, the scientist is season Xs time, and the paradigm could be before or after(although I doubt it’s after). And for some evidence that the rifts are through space and time look at 3 of the main objects that were taken from the map in season 4 and brought back in season 5. The tomato head was sent to the past, wether our worlds past or there worlds past it’s unclear but it’s obviously Mayan architecture, so that’s pointing towards time. Durr burger was sent to the present in our world, point towards space. And the noms sign was sent to most likely the future as it brought back cameras, computers, pipes, and the enforcer with it, so another point towards time. Some other evidence is the objects that came from the rifts like the Norse anchor, or the dinosaur bones, or the anchor. Now back to the main point of the theory. Could the rocket from season 4 be the exact same one that came out of one of the rifts, not the one that was built, that was the scientist I’m pretty sure because we still don’t have any record that the visitor or paradigm created it. In all honesty this doesn’t really affect anything if it is true it’s just a cool theory I thought of waiting for downtime to end.

fs8nwj,AlphaTwitch,Idea: Fortnite Classic,"So as you might have seen multiple sources say, Fortnite is declining in player base every month and/or season. I personally think this is due to a disconnect between Epic and the player base. How did the game go from a fairly simple Battle Royale, to planes, infinity swords, helicopters etc? This is something that I’ve really been saying since Season 5 when they removed Moisty. It was the first season I really didn’t enjoy. Due to sheer nostalgia I kept playing up until season 9/10 when I finally quit. 

Now, for the actual idea. Back in August last year Blizzard released World of Warcraft: Classic. It caused a massive influx of old players to return. I think Fortnite: Classic would have the same potential. Imagine all the OG streamers that would potentially return, which in turn would cause a player influx (huge revenue) due to their viewer base most likely returning as well. Grimmz, Summit, Ceez, Drdisrespect, Hamlinz (idk if he plays anymore), Dae.

I am in no way suggesting to remove current Fortnite, but to *add* a separate client that “is in” Season 1, 2, 3 or maybe even 4 (the last good season from the viewpoint of an “og” player). 

Honestly, this is most likely a dumb idea. I’m just an old player grasping at nostalgia :(.",4,1585640204,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fs8nwj/idea_fortnite_classic/,FortNiteBR,1

fs7drz,BlitzOnInvert,PC Fortnite Performance In-Game,"I don't know about you guys but my textures have been non-existent since the v12.2 update. Before the update, I was running \~190 FPS and textures being great. Now, I've been running a mind boggling \~20 FPS constant with textures looking like they came straight out of a PS1 game. My ping is completely fine at around 20-45. Some examples of my performance being garbage is sometimes when I emote, my character freezes in-place and unable to move or pull out weapons. Another example is the inventory slot icons on the bottom right corner not showing what weapon or item they are. And, building textures look like someone wiped their hand across a wet painting and smeared it. Creative and STW is the only game modes where I get good frames and textures. In Creative I run an easy 240 FPS and STW with about 190 FPS. But yet, I run 20 constant FPS in BR. I would hope to see a performance increase in this next update or the one after this one. I don't know about you but I would rather play on my phone and get a reliable 60 FPS and good textures rather than playing Fortnite imported to an N64. 

I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this in, but I just wanted to speak for the many other people I know that are having this problem as well.

fs71pg,TheRealLifeDrained,Possible fix to Fortnite Issues?,"Okay, here's an idea that I think could possibly satisfy the Fortnite community and at least fix SOME of the many problems that plague this game like Corona 😂 So my idea is a new mode, call it a ""testing mode"" if you will. Basically, it's it's own mode separate from other modes like an LTM that Epic can use to bring back old requested guns and implement new guns/mechanics that Epic and the players would like to see in the game. Make the miniguns two slots? Try it in test mode for a week. Bring back the Combat Shotgun with a Nerf to range and damage? Put it in testing. Have a new storm system? Try the testing mode with heavy feedback systems for optimal voting like at the end of season 9 when we voted back the Drum Gun as a community. More things like that would help balances and things in the game. It seems like the community and Epic are constantly fighting over the game when we should be working together to make the game enjoyable and functional. Fortnite isn't a ""bad game"" as people are saying just because of Epic. It's also partly due to the fanbase basically being indecisive as to what they want, or unsure/unable to agree. A testing mode would fix that. A testing mode with IMPLEMENT NOTES please and thank you Epic 😂 Just some food for thought 🤷",2,1585631978,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fs71pg/possible_fix_to_fortnite_issues/,FortNiteBR,1

Using a DS4 controller and usually the HUD is the same as I am used to on console or Switch. Occasionally though, it defaults to a mobile HUD w/ touch buttons on the screen and the health, mats, and other HUD options where you would see them on mobile w/o controller. 

Doesn’t seem to matter if I connect the DS4 before or after the game loads, this still occasionally happens. I don’t know how to recreate it or what causes it. There’s no real fixing it either that I know of. It usually just fixes by itself after rebooting the device (only to happen again randomly some other time). 

Hoping someone else has some insight on how to fix it. Thanks in advance.",2,1585624888,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fs5fpo/hud_glitch_while_using_controller_ipad_pro/,FortNiteBR,1

So i recently about 1-2months ago made a return to fortnite.  
I have tested many youtube guides on fps patching, I've optimized nvidia control panel multiple times,  
i've overclocked.. i've tried just about everything and while my fps isn't HORRIBLE it's not consistent.  
i will average around 200-300 in creative. in a real game it's a different story and horrendous to the point im pressing builds and they arent placing. it's just not smooth. my fps can get all the way down to 100 or less. (haha wow someone complaining about 100 fps!).. not the point random reddit user.  
the point being the fps isn't consistent making it very choppy this is especially noticeable during fights where lots of quick movement and builds are being made. basically any camera movement will drop FPS. how am i meant to play consistently on something like that? is this fortnite's issue? Back when arenas first came out it was buttery smooth @ 144 fps. unlocked fps always gave above 200 consistent.

onto the audio issue: the sound levels are fine. everything sounds like it's being played at the correct levels. however; directional audio is horrible. if i hotdrop @ lazy lake, 3-4 story buildings it's impossible to track where anyone is. up down left right? it's just footstep noises without being able to pinpoint where it's coming from. while it may sound like it's coming from above. it might be coming from below. this is especially noticeable if im under a chest. (let's say im on the second floor of a house, lets say the chest is above me.) i cannot tell if it's above or below unless i literally pan my camera view up or down to figure it out.

overall it's just a really negative experience and i'm on my last legs with it. i really am not going to upgrade my pc just to play fortnite @ a reasonable smooth framerate but i am not a PC master. any help is appreciated. thanks.",3,1585623509,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fs53sz/fpsaudio_issues/,FortNiteBR,1

fs4ure,bountybreaker15,Some glitches I’d like to see fixed,"Just for context, this is coming from someone playing primarily on Switch. This might not apply to other platforms, but these are just the ones I noticed.

1) Selectable styles not being saved and switching to the default style. I first caught this one when I noticed I couldn’t change the color of TNTna’s glider and was stuck with the red and yellow one, but it also applies to the all of the Sorana cosmetics. This is super annoying. Please fix this one.

2) probably the biggest one: Sometimes when entering a boat I have glitched under the map and died. This happened at Slurpy Swamp and Coral Cove. It’s just kinda annoying. I don’t use boats that often, but when I do I really don’t want to worry about glitching out and loosing a match.

3) the Banner cape has been clipping through some of the new cosmetics, notably the Contract Giller and Slurp Legends pack skins. This isn’t a major bug, but it just bugs my ocd. 

That’s about it. If the devs could fix these in one of the future updates (maybe 12.30 or 12.31) that would be great. I’ve also heard that more and more lag and poor performance has been happening recently. I have shit internet, so I really can’t comment on that. I also heard that players gat stuck on the select weapons screen in the spy games, but I haven’t played them enough to catch this glitch.

I honestly feel like for Chapter 2 Season 1 we could've had a bear pet since it would fit the theme of the woodlands that the island has. 

I never got the chance to get any pets but have always wanted to get one since I started properly putting effort into the seasons this chapter and I am aware there is one pet that's marked as a item shop skin that hasn't appeared since March 13-14th! Meanwhile instead we just keep getting a dumb sunflower that's not even that nice to look at.

I personally would like at least ONE pet to add to my account because I like the concept of them and how unique they all are in their own way and I know a few people who would buy them.

Disclaimer: If you're one of those comp players who says it doesn't give you a advantage...Don't bother posting here. This is coming from a casual player who could not care less about whether a pet gives me a advantage or a disadvantage.

fs11pd,StampyNova23,"Is Anyone Else Getting Bored of Fortnite, Or Is It Just Me?","Hey everyone. I've been pondering something I've had on my mind quite recently concerning the current state of Fortnite, and I was wondering if anyone here on this subreddit could give me an honest answer to my question, which is, **has Fortnite been boring for you?** Now, I understand some people might be diehard fans who play daily, I used to be one of them. But, in my opinion, the game has gotten pretty stale. I don't mean to hate on it, but I've kind of lost interest in the game. Ever since Animal Crossing: New Horizons came out on March 20th, I've been playing it nonstop. There's also a Minecraft server one of my friend's older brother runs, and I've been on that daily as well. I don't really want this game to die out, I really do enjoy the game. It's been a staple of my game history. I played nonstop daily since Season 3. It's honestly kind of sad to see one of my favorite games become a game that I slowly lose interest in. I don't mean to be a Negative Nancy or anything like that, I just want to share my opinions with people so I could understand why some people choose to stop playing it while others choose to continue. I hope this game can flourish soon, but at the time of writing this, it doesn't seem like that. Please leave any suggestions for what I should do to make the game less boring for me too.",8,1585608213,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fs11pd/is_anyone_else_getting_bored_of_fortnite_or_is_it/,FortNiteBR,1

I don't know of this is possible to program and use it for SBMM, but this is where the real skill in this game goes imo, how much do you build and how FAST you can build

For ex:a Xbox One X should have a better FPS than the normal Xbox One).The game is just not fun at the moment you play the game for an hour or more then its get boring for example I can play CoD Warzone for like hours and not get bored cuz the game has so many features and has updates and not bugs(everygame has bugs but they fix them instanly unlike Fortnite we had the same bugs for weeks).The only that EpicGames has to do is just listen to the community and revive there game.

Let's say at Tier 100, you begin with a 10% XP boost, seems pretty chill lat start. Then, maybe every 25 tiers, you get an extra 10% boost. This will reward the players who want to get further and unlock more after unlocking everything in the Battlepass.

frxg1q,solidaditya,God bless all low end pc’s or even high end pc’s in some cases,"Before you all start giving your pro advises like “lol, buy a better pc”, just remember that this game does not have to be this much demanding. The optimization and performance has been long awaited and not just from this season specifically.

All my sympathy towards switch users. This game is becoming a pile of bugs and performance issues.

Didnt want to bring this example but CSGO just brought an update regarding the recent stuttering that started January end this year, and it FIXED the issues to the root. They gave an update for nvidia centric cards. The pro csgo community doesnt reward valve with cosmetics as much as fortnite  does to epic games.

I do understand that optimization and developing the core game is not an easy task and does involve time. But how much is too much? Havent we been in chapter 2 for 5-6 months? Yea, trello card surely says “fps drops” but can we have at least some clarity communication from epic? Clearly, since chapter 2, the comms have been pathetic and we all can agree that things have not been as good as they used to be.

I won’t mind people calling it a rant post as long as this post helps us raising our voice and let epic know that performance update is all we need, we can love without new items.

Also, i gave up on this game for my old pc and i am currently building a new one. So, i am sure this problem is not going to be personal for me specifically. But, i speak on behalf of all those players who have been in the same situation as i have been for months. Not everyone can afford to have 2X 2080 rtx based system to play this game because the developer is taking too much time to optimize this game.",16,1585596620,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frxg1q/god_bless_all_low_end_pcs_or_even_high_end_pcs_in/,FortNiteBR,1

I can’t remember exactly what he said but it was something along the lines of
“If ur gonna dance at least do the original emote and not some rip of why is this bot who didn’t even play until season 7 in my lobby’s!” And then “even if he did play in season three why didn’t you buy the battle pass” like geez sorry money bags I’m not as rich as you just beat you in a build fight and saw you had ttv in ur name and wanted to dance to the 5 people spectating me didn’t know I was in the wrong for not buying the battle pass lol.

Sorry for this rant just annoyed me how people base a players skill level of their cosmetics!

frurgj,PuR3Devils,A few interesting ideas i have had,"1st.
We all know the garbage feeling of either getting a pistol or burst out of our first chest. There isnt too much you can do. (unless you are very good)
And some people do sti like bursts so heres an idea.
In my opinion side grading was a very good addition to the game. They could give us the option to sidegrade our ar's to Bursts and AUGs. They could do that with the pistol aswell. Getting a pistol early can be very anoying so they could remove pistols and bursts from chest and only make them sinde gradable.
Or they could just vault the grey, green and blue pistol.

2nd
Jumppads. We all love them. But it can get very anoying when someone has a lot of them and can keep on flying away. In no means should epic remove them, as they can be used for rotations etc.
They could add a jumppad cap.
E.g:
Solos: 2 jumppads
Duos: 1 jumppad per person
Squads: 2 jumppads for the whole team.

3rd.
Weapon downgrading.
What if we could downgrade our weapons to get a few materials. Lets say we have no mats but a golden scar. And if you are close to a downgrade station you can downgrade your scar to epic to get 50 mats each.
Im not too sure how many mats you should get, but i think it would be a pretty neat feature.",0,1585588239,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frurgj/a_few_interesting_ideas_i_have_had/,FortNiteBR,1

frul0z,wooshifmegagae,The Mythic weapon locations should be harder to take,"Yesterday when I was playing duos, I played 80-90 straight matches where I dropped the grotto, and only failed to capture it twice.  The disguise boxes should not exist.  It literally bypasses the entire point of there being henchmen, and it makes taking down Brutus and the other bosses very easy.  All you have to do is open the scan chests, get a heavy sniper, headshot snipe the boss, then hit him with 1 to 2 shotgun shots.  It can be done in less than three seconds, which is ridiculous and makes it way too easy to get into the vault.  You can literally kill the boss and a bunch of henchmen, jump in a disguise box, then come out completely innocent to the other henchmen.  From that point on, it becomes very easy to win games, as you and your duo are locked and loaded with the best guns in the game, and at full health and shields.   They should add some feature that makes it so that you can't re disguise yourself after being caught for the first time.  I have had similar experiences with the rest of the locations too.",7,1585587699,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frul0z/the_mythic_weapon_locations_should_be_harder_to/,FortNiteBR,1

1) Crashes when you die in the storm at the start of the game in Team Rumble.  Started each match,  got loot, upgraded weapon,  die in storm, game crashes. 


2) Several times when pick up consumable, it tells me that ""Consumables are throwable now"". Yea, I fucking know! If I don't throw that consumable,  and drop it, that slot in my backpack becomes glitched and keeps blinking.


3) I know we can customize HUD layout on mobile,  but there's just not enough room on the screen if you're using fingers and not controlled.  I get it. But a few seasons back,  I was able to answer a call then get back to my game.  Now. Every single time! you lower the screen,  it throws you out of the game back to loading screen.  I. Accidentally pushed Menu- Support, it took me to that page,  I quickly switched back to my game and it booted me out of the game.

add fortnite ""lite"" or ""classic""

uses a form of chapter 1 map and/or old  graphics, have it continue to be updated but keep the updates from making the game run too awful.

One reason for this is that EVERY SINGLE PERSON now has legendary weapons by the end and it's just ridiculous. 

In the past this wasn't such a huge issue because there was a huge variety of weapons and not everyone was running golden pump/scar. Now everyone just finds a blue pump, upgrades it instantly and off they go. I'm personally kinda sick of getting lazered while flying down or instantly getting one tapped as I land. Combine it with that weird bug where it takes 20 seconds to respawn sometimes and it gets even worse...

frnkzt,M2dao,Revive the game back 😢,"dear fortnite, how could u gain this much fans and almost loose it in a blink?what if i told you you can revive it back and have the same number of fans and double !easy  
1ST- bring the old map back .
Cuz ppl like what they know with there eyes closed.
2ND- separate platforms.
Is not fair for both to play together , and I'm sure you hv heard alots of reasons but lemmy list some !
*PC to console :  you guys hv aim assist (thank to all famous PC players now they don't have it )
*console to PC : you guys hv flashy edits can't even see what u building !
(?) but again ask yourself who forced us to play together ! And if someone jumped and tell me they hv an option u could turn off in the setting ! Dah not working cuz u can't even access to battle royal without it 😶.
3rd- bring old shotgun back same animation &amp; power  and look , it's one reason alot of ppl likes this game and become his favorite.
Done thnx for listening ! 
One last thing the graphics and animation overall is more better can't deny
I also love this game that's y it hurts me that I needed to say that",28,1585560229,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frnkzt/revive_the_game_back/,FortNiteBR,1

Epic Games Player Support - Nick C. March 28, 2020, 07:04 -0400 | Hello!

Thank you for contacting Epic Games Player Support! My name is Nick and I will be assisting you today.

I truly understand how it is inconvenient for you to play against PC players. Please be advised that crossplay is only forced if one of your party members is on a different platform. For example, if you are on PS4 and your friends are on Xbox you won't be queued against PC players. But if you are on a console and one of your party members is on PC you will be going to be matched against PC players.

I hope this information clarifies how the crossplay is working.

Regards, Epic Games Player Support - Nick C.””

I can roam the launcher and lobby freely but once I get into a game the issue occurs. This has never happened during loading screens, or lobby. I have seen almost every tutorial on youtube but nothing seems to help it. My final solution is to fully reset my pc but i'm trying to hold that off. Any final ideas?

\-Builds not placing at all, or placing incorrectly (i.e. coning myself in or putting a wall right in front of me rather than in the grid that is right in front of me).  
\-FPS drops  
\-Editing feels weird (this might be because the feeling of builds being off).  
\-Phasing through builds at the oddest times when placing them.

  
I understand that there is only so much Epic employees can do right now, but I also feel like these things have been an issue for a very long time (for me) and I have no other friends who play Fortnite so I'm the only one I know who experiences these issues.  And some of these things might be user error or even issues with my controller (scuf impact with digital bumpers and triggers) but I just want to see if anyone else out there is in agreement with me.  
There might be other issues that I am experiencing that I am forgetting to list at the moment but if I remember I'll add to this post or create another if this one does not have that much attention.

Writers note: I am fully aware that this is not the entire community but it feels like the majority. If anything, whenever epic makes changes, I'm actually on their side. Do I think everything they do is perfect? No. But, at least we are able to play the game. I made this post because I'm tired of people constantly saying exact same bug/problem that's in the game. While game feedback is important, the constant complaining isn't. Some things take longer to fix than others.If you don't like it, then don't play it. Otherwise, stop crying.

I log into fortnite on PS4 again and there has been no sync of accounts. No stats or skins transferred.

frjgj7,fortniteplayerGG,Complaints,"A lot of pros are complaining about the game being boring, for example ninja said that the game is boring right now because the game doesn’t have new content and said that the choppa just flies and does anything else. If the choppa had guns people would scream and cry that it was op and want it removed. The game isn’t boring it’s just that YOU want kills and don’t try fun new tactics. And it’s basically your job to play this game and let’s face it jobs ARE BORING. I get it there hasn’t really been new content but ninja said they should bring the old map back. For years all the pros wanted a new map and epic delivered, now the pros want it back. Sorry but it was literally sucked into a black whole and most of it was already destroyed. It hasn’t even been two whole seasons and the map is now “boring”, really? This just shows the greed that a lot of the pros have and it just bothers me knowing I’m a casual player and epic won’t listen to me no matter how hard I try. And little do they know epic is probably waiting to release something big. God I really hate how privileged the pros are. Even you tubers think they have to change there video schedules because there is nothing new in the game. Just make new strats or make up a gamemode in creative. It’s not hard to think.

This game has none of that. Being in a team is fully optional and even if, it's not nearly as bad. When I share my experiences on Reddit I get called trash and people tell me I'm bad. The experience feels more casual and fun (I guess that makes me a bad person because I don't get angry at a loss like Ninja said I should?)

frimgb,Z3R0Scarlet,My Issue with SBMM and Forced Crossplay,"There are lots of things about Fortnite that can make the game really unenjoyable. For example, SBMM and forced crossplay. Almost everyone I know wants it gone, and it only makes sense to me. Let me tell you why I dislike it.

SBMM (Skill-Based Matchmaking) was added to that noobs could actually enjoy the game. However, the devs fail to realize that it made the game unenjoyable for the remaining majority of the player base. In recent weeks, EVERYONE I encounter is an absolute sweatlord. I would say I'm an above-average player, but that's besides the point. 

Im not sure why forced crossplay was added. I'll read into it later. However, I, being an Xbox player, would not like to go up against a player with 240 FPS. AND they're on my skill level? My gaming experience is far from enjoyable. I play to have fun, not to play Arena without Siphon.

Before anyone says that ""I only want SBMM and forced crossplay removed so I can pub-stomp and wreck the noobs"", just know that I have no interest in doing that at all. However, I DO believe that in order to truly get better at the game and have, you need to be able to adapt to different playstyles, because you can't improve playing against only yourself. That being said, I still think it's unfair for a PC player to fight against a console player.

I don't know, maybe I'm just being selfish. But if I want anything taken out of Fortnite, it's SBMM and forced crossplay.",14,1585535576,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frimgb/my_issue_with_sbmm_and_forced_crossplay/,FortNiteBR,1

There is no aim assist on linear if you are on hip fire. This means that it’s really hard to hit any shots at all with any guns in those situations where you can’t ads (ads aim assist is currently on) example situation: box fights, often you need to shoot from hip because using ads will remove your ability to move at all. 

I’ve seen a lot of discussion going on about this but you guys haven’t said a word yet as far as I know. 

I rely on aim assist. I’ve tried to play without it but it’s nearly impossible. I’m still able to outplay my opponents but when it comes to finishing them I just can’t hit with linear movement and no aim assist.

Epic could add ALL weapons/ weapon variants in Creative. What I mean by that is adding the old Drum Gun, the old Infinity Blade or the Zapotron. If some weapons had major changes (like the Drum Gun), they'll have the same amount of damage, fire rate or mechanic as they previously were and they'll be marked as [Weapon name] (Old)

It could be awesome for newer players to experience old variants that they never got the chance to use but  I think it'll be quite hard to make.",4,1585525620,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frg1e0/creative_weapons/,FortNiteBR,3

But after the Chapter 2 season 2 update, the FPS in the lobby dropped down to 90-100FPS and 40-50 in a real game. Not only that but the textures never render fast enough. This has never been a problem up until now. I hope it isn't only me experiencing it cause the game feels unplayable right now mostly. After all, textures don't render fast enough and there are huge FPS drops.

frds1q,FoniasTodoroki,Please fix this,"So for the past month I’ve noticed a bug on Nintendo where when you’re just about to take the last shot on a guy your FPS drops significantly. It’s starting to get super super annoying, considering Switch only has 30 FPS tops in the first place, because it then drops to 1-5 FPS and causes me to die. I’m pretty sure it’s a game issue, not my switch, because my switch isn’t particularly laggy or bad. 

Again, it is gettin quite annoying and I would really like if someone could look into it. Or if there is a way to change my FPS to 60 atleast like Mobile so the frame drop isn’t as bad I would really like to know.   

I also find it quite weird that mobile can get a better FPS than switch, which is another thing I can’t understand because technically switch is a console (I think)",2,1585517588,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frds1q/please_fix_this/,FortNiteBR,2

frdor9,kdouglas23,Fortnite’s Problems (Explained),"First and foremost, Fortnite has a lot of problems within the game. Below are detailed and explained bullet points on why it is.

• SBMM and FCP - We all know and hate Skilled Based Matchmaking and Forced Cross play. Nowadays, there are not many newer or bad players that play. SBMM is aimed towards newer players and players that are not as good, when Fortnite is losing a ton of players because of this. They are losing more players than gaining because of this, when Fortnite now barely gets any newer players compared to before. 

• Map - We all want the old map back, admit it. We all had so many memories in the old map and loved it. This map is huge and is little to no fun to play on. On the old map, while rotating, I would come across a player or two right away or in little to no time. Earlier when I was playing today, I got bored easily because I spent a good 5-10 minutes trying to find people to fight. In conclusion, please just continue the storyline on the old map. We know there’s a whole storyline and a reason why the old map is gone, but if you really want to get more players back, Epic, have the old map make a return.

• Patch Notes - There are absolutely no patch notes whatsoever. This is just a lazy thing to do and is useless to have no patch notes. There is no reason why there should be no patch notes at all.

If you have any other suggestions, leave them below, but I cannot think of any detailed and explained reasons anymore besides the game getting boring and lack of content. Epic please just listen to us before Fortnite fully dies. Stay safe everyone.",14,1585517276,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frdor9/fortnites_problems_explained/,FortNiteBR,0

frdmq4,BuffMahClass,They need to nerf the Heavy or at least decrease its spawn rate.,"Basically the title. The heavy sniper is already  undeniably one of the best weapons in the entire game. The ability to one shot break any wall combined with its 150dmg makes it a force to be reckoned with. The problem with this weapon that has arisen in this season is that it spawns wayyyyy too much. Before this season you were likely to run into maybe 1 or 2 people with the weapon, but know it seems as if every person I fight has one. The high damage/utility of this gun, plus the abundance of it, I feel makes it too powerful in the meta. I would suggest either nerfing it’s spawn rate or nerfing he actual weapon itself.

frdfpo,Flamingpaper,Suppressing weapons (via Upgrade Benches),"Suppressed Weapons are cool, but I don't think they should be as rare as they are, considering you can only get them from 2 (maybe 3?) locations on the map. I would rather they exist, but just be alternatives to weapons.

1. Suppressor item. 
Maybe from ammo boxes, you should be able to get a suppressor instead of a stack of ammo, about as rare as rockets. And it could also be found as floor loot occasionally, and will always come from the blue ammo boxes (which have no name btw). And this item will go into inventory in the section with the ammo (no inventory space lost). This item will be used to turn weapons into their suppressed versions (if they exist).

2. Suppressing items.
Once you have a suppressor, you can go to an upgrade bench with, say, your purple Assault Rifle, and the option to sidegrade will be replaced with a small menu or something, which using the trigger buttons on controllers could swap between Sidegrade (AR to Heavy AR) and Suppress. Once you have Suppress as the option selected, you can spend 20 of each material plus a Suppressor, to create a purple Suppressed Assault Rifle. I would also like it if you could take a Suppressed Weapon and take off the Suppressor at an Upgrade Bench for 20 of each material, to get a Suppressor back, so I could put it on my pistol, instead. This would work better if you can get Suppressed items out of chests, so you have to find an Upgrade Bench to unsuppress it, if that fits your playstyle better. This could make it so we have more weapons in the game without overly clogging the lootpool with worthless items, since you can change between the version you want, based on your preference.

3. Suppressed Weapons and potential stats
Based on what Suppressed weapons exist, they have a general trend of being more accurate and reloading faster, but dealing less damage. In order for this idea to work, we would need new variants of several weapons, so I decided to create a list of suppressed weapons with their old and new versions included, to create an idea of what these weapons might be like. All these stats are hypothetical.

Suppressed Pistol
Damage from 24/25/26/28/29  to  22/23/24/26/27
Reload times from 
1.5/1.5/1.4/1.3/1.3  to  1.4/1.4/1.3/1.2/1.2

Note: Magazine size for the Suppressed Pistol should also be reverted to 16

Suppressed SMG
Damage from 17/18/19/20/21  to  20/21/22/23/24
Reload times from 
2.4/2.3/2.2/1.8/1.7  to  2.2/2.1/2.0/1.8/1.6

Notes: 
- Damage for the Suppressed version is higher, due to a lower fire rate.
- Headshot multiplier for the Suppressed SMG should be reverted back to 2.0x, to make the weapon viable again.

Suppressed AR
Damage from 30/31/33/35/36 to 27/29/30/32/33
Reload times from
2.5/2.4/2.3/2.2/2.1  to  2.5/2.4/2.3/2.1/2.0


Suppressed (Bolt-Action) Sniper Rifle
Damage from 
95/100/105/110/116 to 85/90/95/100/105
Reload times from
3.4/3.2/3.0/2.5/2.3  to  3.30/3.15/3.0/2.85/2.70

Note: The damage and reload times for the Suppressed Sniper are the stats for the pre Season 2 version, as I feel that version was more inline and balanced, compared to the Bolt's stats, since both would have to exist together in this concept and the Bolt, if in game with the new Suppressed Sniper, would be extremely underpowered by comparison.",0,1585516364,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frdfpo/suppressing_weapons_via_upgrade_benches/,FortNiteBR,3

frdego,CnstrnCone,Here are some reasons to join Shadow instead of Ghost,"&amp;#x200B;

* we have the power of kevin. everyone loved kevin, and those who are on ghost can't say they like kevin if they are against a team using his energy. we even have a statue honouring him
* we have a pack, ghost does not. slurp legends on their own look cooler than all the edit styles for ghost.
* we actually have an item shop skin that represent us. what does ghost have? peekaboo and nitenite.
* people who say we created the oil spill at the rig don't realize that ghost has a yacht that pollutes too. we don't even know for sure that shadow destroyed the rig, it would make sense that TNTina blew it up due to how many explosives she has.
* we use houses for our bases, and we don't waste any space doing so. we are resourceful, and don't need much land to do our business. the agency has a huge base for what? they only have a couple of rooms that actually have purpose. even ghost's conference room does not have a chair for their leader. what a joke.
* midas is the leader of ghost, and yet, he has a shadow edit style. do you see chaos agent having a ghost style? no. not only is ghost unprofessional, their leader can't even make up his mind.
* shadow looks cooler than ghost. when you look good, you play good. that is why ghost always loses POI's to shadow.
* what good has ghost done for the island? their henchman killed so many people for no reason. if the henchmen are supposed to protect their base, why does their base have open doors? we have henchmen to protect our bases because they are actually protected and not out in the open. another reason why shadow is the smarter team.
* midas guards his ""base"" instead of using his powers for the better of his team. why stay at your base when you can go out and use a magical power? seems kinda dumb for a leader of an organization.

that's it. make the smart decision to join Shadow",20,1585516239,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frdego/here_are_some_reasons_to_join_shadow_instead_of/,FortNiteBR,1

frdbof,sewshyfish,[POSITIVE] How I think the game can be improved.,"I would like to say that although I do enjoy the game right now, it could be a lot better.  
Back in the summer of 2018 when it was season 4-5? In my opinion that was the most fun Fortnite ever was. It was so fun back then. Kids getting in trouble for playing too much Fortnite instead of going outside. One of the largest Fortnite tournaments to date. The first live event. A new biome, and so much more. These were the times when epic was working their asses off for us. I am not trying to say that doesn't happen now, but so much effort went into those seasons. 

I would say that effort hit an all-time low around season 9. The ""magic"" wasn't there anymore. The community was getting more toxic. The loot pool was not as balanced. The cosmetics were not as original. The map was nearly ruined, and the views on Youtube, Twitch, and other platforms were at an all-time low.

Then The End happened, or one of the best things to happen to Fortnite for nearly a year. I feel these few days of just a black screen and anticipation were the best way to introduce Chapter 2. The season started off great with the VERY balanced loot pool and a great first drop. That first drop had the ""magic"" that I brought up before. It felt like a new beginning. Then disappointment struck. No new content, no patch notes, and an extra 2 MONTHS added on to this empty season! Epic knew they had to fix this, so they did what they do best: Build up hype. The phone numbers, Youtube ads, and PLENTY of teasers. Chapter 2 Season 2 started off very great even though it was lacking patch notes. The meta FINALLY changed, and the competitive scene was a bit more fun. That brings us up to present times. 

So, how do I think epic can improve (NOT FIX, I don't think the game is broken) Fortnite? Well to start, the ""magic"" I was talking about is continuous support and meta changes. The reason seasons 1-8 were most successful is because of the continuous support and meta changes. These kept everyone hooked to the game week after week. I understand they are doing that now, but a content update is at least once a month. The map back then also received a minor update once a season. Once again I understand the 5 new POIs are technically ""part of the map"" but they are not connected to the man part of the map. I am referring to the meteor crash site, the Desert biome, a floating island, a snow biome, and dare I say it a snow biome. Season 8 topped it off with the ballers or one of the greatest vehicles in Fortnite. The pirate bases and the volcano were also great. I think the ""magic"" was lost in season 9 because of the summer it had to live up to. The summer of 2018 compared to 2019 is not a fair comparison. 2018's summer was SO much better because of the continuous support of GOOD content. Epic messed around with new items and POIs too much in season 9 and 10. The meta wasn't too bad, but it could have been better.

My final thoughts would be for epic to just give us that ""magic"" of 2018 back. The meta and continuous support were incredible, and I applaud them for that. If epic just gives us patch notes back, brings back the ""magic"" and overall gives us a summer to remember like 2018. Fortnite will be back on top and remain there for a long, long time.",7,1585515981,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frdbof/positive_how_i_think_the_game_can_be_improved/,FortNiteBR,1

frcgdf,AndrewIsCoolio,"I landed at every named location 10 times, this is what I think of each one. Part 3: Craggy Cliffs","Welcome back to the series. This one was a little delayed, I focused on spy games a lot since the last post on this series, but I'm back. This time, it is part 3. If you wanna know what this is about and the rules, check Part 1.

#CRAGGY CLIFFS

Craggy Cliffs is a location that was added last season. It is to the north center of the map, next to a river.

Craggy was without a doubt a very shocking location to me. What was a location I used to think was bad, and I didn't care about is now a pretty good spot to me, I consider making it one of my mains. 

Craggy is a solid spot. A really underrated place, I might say. 

Loot wise, it's pretty average. It is easy to loot and has satisfying loot. 
Popularity wise, it's surprisingly really calm most of the time. I never really got a hot drop Craggy, only once, and I got 4 kills just in Craggy itself. 

What shocked me was that it's actually a really good spot. It's what you expect from your average town location, like Pleasant, Salty, etc. But without too much popularity and just really good overall. 
I'm scratching my head trying to think of anything bad about Craggy, but I just can't. 

It may seem like the zone is an issue, but it's next to a river so you can take a boat. Alternatively, you can climb the mountain east of it and get a helicopter.

It has pretty average mats. Again, what you'd expect from a town location. Bunch of cars, trees, rocks, and houses with furniture. There's a lot of rocks nearby and trees aswell. I managed to get full mats once after the second zone.

Overall, Craggy was a shocker to me. It's a really good spot, with practically no downsides.
I give it a 9/10


Loot: 7/10

Materials: 7/10

Popularity: 5/10

Mobility: 7/10

Zone and Location: 3/10



So far, Craggy is the first location to surprise me. I highly recommend it, it's a calm spot. If you're looking for a good spot that balances loot and popularity, you have the perfect one. 

Stay tuned, for Pleasant Park! Coming in around 2-3 days.",4,1585512942,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frcgdf/i_landed_at_every_named_location_10_times_this_is/,FortNiteBR,7

I tried to go link my accounts again and I can’t do it because I already have an account linked to my xbox which happens to be this brand new account. Is there any work around to this because I know epic doesn’t allow you to unlink and link accounts because of the whole buying accounts thing.

Hell, I used an emoji in the title of my post and it later got removed for “uSiNg TeXt LiKe ThIs”. You remove shit based on your personal preference, and not based on your rules. You might as well get rid of the rules and say “if we don’t like your post or it’s not some INSANE EPIC GAMER MOMENT!!1!1!, then we have the right to remove it because me no likey your post. They remove too many posts and any post that they feel should be removed weather wrong or right and spit 20 different general guidelines of why they did it yet they do not point out which one it is.

You guys are also petty as hell, because whenever someone calls you out on your bullshit you rush to delete it if your bullshit bot doesn’t first. You guys are venomous pricks, and I’m surprised that anyone would EVER give you guys money for a stupid little badge and name color. It honestly sickens me that this of all subs is what Epic looks at, and not some other subreddit known for having good moderation and non-corrupt, rule breaking mods.

Delete this post, but just know that won’t change mine and many others opinion on you guys- in fact, it’ll strengthen my point. If you guys aren’t totally useless and petty, you’ll keep this post up in the name of free speech. Oh, and if you want some “feedback” to match the flair, here it is: follow your own rules, I’m fed up with it.",12,1585509250,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/frbdla/dear_mods_go_f_yourselves_this_post_doesnt_break/,FortNiteBR,0

frb4ep,FortniteTheoristh07,I SOLVED IT! The ACTUAL Oro and Midas Storyline SOLVED. (El Dorado?!),"So my previous theory that I had posted was a bit all over the place, so I have decided to make a smoother, and more understandable version.

Okay, so in Season 8, we had an ancient temple POI named Sunny Steps. It looks exactly like the ancient temple from El Dorado the film. In the film, right next to the Lost City of Gold as it is called, there is a volcano. In Season 8, Sunny Steps was right next to a volcano...

The film is based off of real life history. El Dorado, which is translated to the Golden King, performed a ritual by covering himself in gold- he became the Golden King and his Kingdom/Land was the Lost City of Gold- Sunny Steps in Fortnite's version.

I mean, you have to search the Lost City of Gold up on the Internet and look at images. The city looks just like Sunny Steps.

In Season 8, the people home to Sunny Steps were Master Key, Luxe and Peely. They have nothing to do with the pirates, as seen in the Week 3 Loading Screen for that season, where Sidewinder- who was a pirate- steals from Sunny Steps.

Anyway, Luxe, who was the Tier 100 Skin, was gold-themed, and she lived a life of luxury as seen in the Week 7 Loading Screen from that season. I think she is related to El Dorado, who is Oro. Think about it- El Dorado means Golden King.

So in Chapter 2, the question is: Has Oro been on the Chapter 2 island the whole time? Has he only just awakened.

I believe that Sunny Steps had been underneath the island the entire time throughout Chapter 1. It was the Lost City of Gold. That would also fit into the theme for Season 8- the secrets of the island being uncovered.

If Chapter 2 is an alternate version of Chapter 1, then surely the Lost City of Gold/Sunny Steps should still be underneath the island? And this time, instead of Luxe, it is El Dorado, the Golden King.

Midas, as we know, has come to the island for revenge.

I need to clear something up. Alot of people think that the Agency is Ghost. Originally, it was not.

The whole point of the Agency was for Midas' revenge. It was built for Midas. He wanted revenge on Oro, who is the Golden King. But Midas wants to be the Golden King, and so he has harnessed the powers of Oro which is why Oro awakens.

In Chapter 2 Season 1, the middle island started turning to gold. Midas had arrived on the island- he was about to get his revenge, but then he found out about the war going on between A.L.T.E.R and E.G.O.

He begins to study the two organisations, which is why there is an E.G.O document on the toilet. He then decides that he wants to join the Ghost team, and that is why the Agency POI is Ghost. Meowscles, his right hand man, therefore also has to join Ghost. The other Agents come along and join the fight, creating their own outposts (The Rig; The Shark; The Grotto etc), spying on the war and choosing which side they want to be on. This will split the operatives of the Agency apart.

Alot of people are saying: ""Well, the Agency is Ghost, because The Agency location and The Yacht are both Ghost.""

 The original styles of Midas and Meowscles are normal Agents- neither Ghost nor Shadow. The Agency was originally a separate organisation. When Midas was spying on the war at the end of Season 1, he decided that Ghost was much better and so joined the Ghost team- and so did Meowscles. 

I think that, if there is one, the live event of this season will be a battle between Oro and Midas. If Oro wins, I think that Season 3 will be El Dorado themed, and we will get locations similar to Sunny Steps. But if Midas wins, I think that either something new will happen because Midas has his revenge, or the storyline between Ghost and Shadow will progress.

**PRIZE: Uncommon Dance/Wrap of your choice. DM me when the item of your choice is in the shop and I will give it to you.**

RULES:

1. You can only choose 1 special ability for the respective cosmetics. You can only post that type of comment once in this post.

2. The comment has to have the following format: [Name of the outfit(s)/set][name of the ability][effect]

3. The comment with more upvotes within 24 hours, WINS. If there’s s tie, I will chose the winner based on the outfit he/she has flaired.

4. In order to qualify to the prize, the comment NEEDS to have AT LEAST, 10 upvotes.

5. This is for fun, please don’t downvote everyone here just because you don’t want them to win. Let’s be honest and give them a upvote if we like their abilities.

TIPS: 

1. Be creative with both the name and the special ability.

2. The ability has to make sense with the concept of the cosmetic.

3. Choose cosmetics that are unique and can have creative and unique abilities. Most uncommon outfits won’t be easy to asign a creative and unique ability.

4. Try that the ability is not overpowered and boring. Ex: Ark is inmortal because is an angel. Zombie soccer can resurrect because are zombies. Malcore can fly because has wings. Those are not creative.

Examples (you can still choose these cosmetics but with different abilities ofc):

1. [Oro][Golden Touch][Convert any weapon to legendary rarity]

2. [Zero][Zero Point][Teleport anywere in the map twice per game]

3. [Malice/Dominion][Demon’s seduction][200% damage to opposite sex]

4. [The Prisioner][Flame Body][When hit a player, burn him dealing damage by 1 during 5 seconds, reset after each hit]

5. [Big Chuggus][Chugg everywere][Converts Mini shields into Chug Splash (2)]

6. [Teef][Soft body][Nullifies fall damage]

7. [Omen/Fate][Untold destiny][Knows the next safe circle one round before]

8. [Brutus][Brutal Gun][Increase Minigun firing time to 200%]

9. [Burning Beast][Fire power][Increase damage of fire outfits by 200%]

10. [Falcon][Bird attack][Increase gliding speed by 200%]

Now lets have a fun discussion and let’s see which one is the best ability and who wins the price!",34,1585504333,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fr9ysx/attention_fortnite_now_has_rpg_mechanics_and/,FortNiteBR,6
fr9ysn,Sklus20,Please Can I get Some Help,I’ve tried all of these building courses and every single one is just edits. I am dogshit at building and would like to be able to actually fucking build. But practicing in matches doesn’t do anything because I just get shit on and can’t actually build. I’m tired of being told to just practice building in pubs against other people like I don’t understand how they always place ramps before me. I really just wanna quit this game but I would rather just get better and shit on other people. The only building I can do is box fighting and I seem to do much better late game but in an open area I just don’t know how to build anything. Is there a practice course or a guide for building. I looked up stuff on YouTube and somehow there is not a single actual guide they’re all just tips that are not possible if you can’t fucking build. I’m just pissed off and might just uninstall this game how the hell is there no guides that’s really the part that’s pissing me off,4,1585504332,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fr9ysn/please_can_i_get_some_help/,FortNiteBR,1

 no it's not another complain about sbmm or forced cp or about a weapon i promise lol

 i have the trashiest PC in history. i have E8400 with a GTX 960 i get 20-30 FPS every single game, dropping to 10 VERY frequently. i play since mid season X, and I got about 50 wins, 18 of them being solo. however I feel super unmotivated because like i'm not mechanically the best at the game, i play on 80 ping and with that horrendous FPS. 

every single person i fight cranks up to high limit in 2.23 seconds i just try to get kills and wins to have fun at the game, since rotating only obviously isnt fun, but i don't remeber the last game i won and even the last game i got over 2 kills, which is something i used to be able to do easily before.

i just dont feel like its worth playing this game anymore.

i want to go pro, yes im saving up for a new pc. however that will unfortunately only come in about an year.

my friends are always playing some other games like fifa, which i dont have and dont want to get.

fr5oxr,LEGO_BrickfilmsYT,Counter against minigun and drum gun spam?,"I was playing random squads but my teammates died in the beginning of the game I didn't and survived till the last 3 people remained.

That was a team of 2 and they started spamming with Brutus' minigun and Midas' drum gun. I tried to protect me with metal but it wasn't enough so I couldn't heal or reload. Meanwhile the storm was in my back and I didn't have a launchpad. I later died by the storm since I couldn't build up the hill (my builds were placed in the hill or something) and got second. No replay availabe since I am playing on switch (don't know if there is a replay on switch)

When i drop from the bus the hang glider animation doesn't start and sometimes there's a sort of strange effect where the character goes underground. On top of that all the buildings are blurry, the doors black and i can't enter them. As mentioned above sometimes i can't even break things with the pickaxe.

Is anyone having the same problems and/or knows how to fix them? I've already contacted epic games support, but as in my country everything is closed for the recent Coronavirus outbreak, i don't expect any answer soon.

Encountered no issues, did what it said on the tin etc etc. The other day, the camera was moving up by itself in games unless I constantly had my finger over the right analogue stick. I checked my settings to see if I had ridiculously low deadzones, but they are both on the default of 20 20.

What I want to know is, is this an issue with the game or is it my controller that has had its time?

It could just be a coincidence, but I never had drift (other than the season 5 skin- yes comedy genius right there) before the most recent update, that's why I'm asking.",2,1585485486,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fr59yj/stick_drift_that_started_very_recently_my/,FortNiteBR,1
fr59xr,Clarky1988,Blueprint anim glitch,"For as long as I can remember I've noticed a graphical glitch which seemed to occur when building / editing. Its very specific and appears as a line which renders for a single frame. I've found that I could see this line flashing across the map, which when I saw it, meant I could tell that other people were building, sometimes at great distances before I even saw the players or builds, this served as a clue that people are building, I've confirmed that this occurs when any player on the island performs the blueprint pull out animation.

I decided to look into this further and think I've worked out when it happens, and have a theory of why this happens, so I've provided a video and some still images (at the end of the video) to show how the bug manifests.

The bug centres around the animation for pulling out the blueprints, what I believe is happening, is that the vertices which make up the blueprint, for one frame, are set at the world origin (or some other value which results in them rendering to a fixed point in the world), as you can see from the images, the vertices always draw to the same origin regardless of the your position in the world.

I hope this is useful and helpful in addressing this issue. Cheers.",2,1585485483,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fr59xr/blueprint_anim_glitch/,FortNiteBR,1

This has never been a problem up until now. I hope it isn't only me experiencing it cause the game feels unplayable right now mostly.

fr42s8,FortniteTheoristh07,Weird Theory: El Dorado and Midas.,"This is a weird theory- but theories can be weird, so I am going to put this out here anyway.

In Season 8, an ancient village appeared called Sunny Steps. It was home to Master Key, Peely and Luxe. 

In the film El Dorado, a very similar design to Sunny Steps is seen next to a volcano. Sunny Steps in Fortnite is next to a volcano. And when I say a similar design, I mean a VERY similar design. Literally, they have the exact same pyramid structures.

El Dorado- which coincidentally is translated to the Golden King- was an actual person in real life. I believe that Luxe from Season 8 was related to this Spanish myth in some way- perhaps she is related to El Dorado.

Then, I thought. Well, what if Oro is El Dorado? 

Midas has come to the island because he wants revenge on somebody- presumably Oro. He woke Oro up by harnessing the powers of Oro, who is the Golden King. El Dorado. El Dorado vs. Midas? Anybody?

I don't know why Midas would want revenge on Oro/El Dorado. Perhaps Midas was originally the Golden King but then Oro took away his powers and that is why Midas is know taking the powers back???

Again, it is just a theory, but thanks for reading!",1,1585478908,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fr42s8/weird_theory_el_dorado_and_midas/,FortNiteBR,1

fr2t39,ThePureLemon,Fortnite on the switch in near unplayable.,"My argument is exactly as the title says. This game is almost to infuriating to play on switch. I understand the FPS cap, but it does nothing when half the time, the fps is close to 20. This could be fixed by giving us, along with other consoles, the ability to change graphics. Even if not that, let us change shadows or switch them off. 

Even without all that, the aim assist and bloom consistantly go off the rails and act as if they turn themselfs of and get 2x worse, respectively. 

Opening loot lamas drop FPS lower than 10 FPS, along with other partical effect across the map.

I am forced to opt out of cash cups, area and other competitive modes because it becomes pretty hard to play at the end of matches.

MMR is an entirely different post, but it dosnt help on switch when everyone else has 2x higher FPS. 

In a time of shut down and inability to move to my higher tier consoles, switch is the only thing I can play this game. I love this game with all my heart, but it's becoming more and more infuriating to play. 

Please, Epic, or the fortnite team or whomts ever needs to hear this, fix the switch. I dont wana loose the love for something I've put thousands of hours into.",57,1585471395,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fr2t39/fortnite_on_the_switch_in_near_unplayable/,FortNiteBR,1

fr2g7q,domion112233,I think the season x fortnite map was the best map.,"Ok first off, this is MY opinion, and im in no way saying that season x was a good season. So i think that the season 1 map was boring because there was nothing to see, other than green fields and stuff, (same with the chapter 2 map) and i like when the map is full of stuff to see, like neotilted, the riftzones, etc. i love it when the map is packed full of locations and interesting rhings to see. I dont like when you have to run for hours to get from one place to another without seeing anything cool, but i mean at the end of the season it kinda got boring, but it is still my favorite map in fortnite.",3,1585469268,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fr2g7q/i_think_the_season_x_fortnite_map_was_the_best_map/,FortNiteBR,1

fr0so9,JaysonRyder,"Skins, right?","A load of skins are just defaults in other costumes, so I think Epic should release every default as an individual skin, Jonesey, Ramirez, Headhunter, Spitfire, Hawk, Renegade, Banshee, and Wildcat would all be different skins you can pick and choose, and every outfit they have, like how Jonesey is E.L.F., Chomp Sr., Rex, and like 80 other things, would all be styles under that character. This would condense the skin selection section a considerable amount, and the outfit styles would be sorted obviously by decending rarity. (I personally think it would be interesting for each outfit or other character to have 1 ability that they would have as that version of themself in STW. So Drift and Catalyst could shoot lightning, Calamity could control shadow, all the iced skins could have a cold snap ability, or an ability they'd have anyway, like Raven controlling shadow, red knight having a rage burst, devourer having its toxic breath weapon but severely scaled down, or Fishstick breathing underwater. Glacial E.L.F. is actually interesting because his ice form is acompanied by the green fire that Deadfire usually has, which could give the user a flame ring burst attack. Prisoner, Ruin, Ember-even in overtime form-, and the darkfire pack skins would also have this but it'd be their individual flame colors.)

We apologize for the inconvenience."" Since I play on a laptop, I use the MSI afterburner to try to get some decent FPS. I actually also had trouble launching games on the Epic Games launcher like Dauntless, but was still able to run games from other launchers. As i mentioned, i play games on my laptop, so i only have access to 2 settings on the Afterburner: Core Clock &amp; Memory Clock. For Core, i set it on +350, and for Memory, i set it on +415. I kept messing around with it to see what its limits were, as i normally did Core +220 and Memory +315. It seems that the other games have no limit, while games from the Epic Games launcher seems to act up. I turned off the Afterburner after discovering this, and Fortnite successfully launched again. I did +220 and +315 again, Fortnite successfully launched. Is my laptop just weird or does the launcher have some sort of thing that interferes with the afterburner?",2,1585458916,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fr0g8q/fortnite_crashing_when_i_use_msi_afterburner/,FortNiteBR,1

fqzaqe,COOLSTORY-_-BRO,"Team Rumble is a Joke, but it Doesn't Need to Be","I enjoy playing team rumble more than other modes, for a lot of reasons. However, lately the quality has gone downhill substantially, and this seems to be because of the mix between these three groups of players: Skilled players, new players, and trolls. I do not have a problem with new players or skilled players. However, the third group is ruining the game for the other two. 

What are trolls in Team Rumble, you might ask? These are players who:

- Intentionally edit their own teammate out of their build.
- Destroy their teams builds when it serves no strategic purpose.
-Follow teammates at the start of the game, in order to steal loot or prevent their teammate from getting loot.
- Use boats to destroy trees or buildings that their own teammates are in.

The list goes on, but these types of players are proof that ranked team rumble is badly needed. I propose using eliminations minus deaths or some other measure for success. It must disincentivize being eliminated or it will not work. This would make it so that skilled players rarely have to deal with trolls, and the game would also be more enjoyable for new/unskilled players.",15,1585453864,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fqzaqe/team_rumble_is_a_joke_but_it_doesnt_need_to_be/,FortNiteBR,1

fqxise,UnknownFor3818,Suggestion: Allow Challenges to be Completed in Creative Mode and Battle Lab One Day Out of Every Season,"Doing challenges in Solos, Duos, Squads, and even Team Rumble can be difficult at times. So, maybe one day out of a season, people could go into playground, creative, or battle lab to complete challenges. 

Now, if Epic were to add this, they could put some restrictions. For example, they could put a cap on the number of challenges you can complete, or the specific challenge sets. For example, they could say you can only do ten challenges in total (maybe 5 from one challenge set then 5 from another). Epic could also make it to where you can complete up to a certain number of challenges from each set. For example, 3 from TNTina's Trial, 3 from Brutus' Briefing, and 3 from Meowscles' Mischief.

This is just a suggestion I am not sure that it will get added into the game (because we have team rumble), but I still hope it does. For some reason, there are many tryhard players coming into team rumble, doing 90s and build fights, which can make the completion of challenges harder. But don't take this as a rant about SBMM and FCP; it is merely a suggestion that could help Fortnite players complete challenges easier and quicker than usual.

Nonetheless, I understand why Epic might not want to add this to the game, considering that challenges are supposed to ""challenge"" the player.",10,1585446750,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fqxise/suggestion_allow_challenges_to_be_completed_in/,FortNiteBR,1

fqwftg,amster77,Choppa glitch needs immediate hotfix ...," 

    What issue happened?  Other team used Choppa glitch to win
    
    What platform are you playing on?  2 on PC, 1 on Xbox, 1 on PS4
    
    What happened prior to seeing the issue?  We were winning - the other team did not appear on the map
    
    Do you have a link to video/screenshots depicting the issue? No, but I might be able to get it if needed. There are, apparently, youtube videos about it out there, which I discovered after our loss.

We just finished a round, and made it to the very end, our full squad of 4 intact. The other team was NOWHERE to be found. We looked EVERYWHERE, and searched the skies very well. Nowhere to be seen. It was just the four of us, in a slowly closing circle. We were trying to figure out if they had full fish inventories, were constantly fishing, what? They would've had to be in the storm for a LONG time at that point, as we could clearly see all around us, and would have run out of healing by then.

&amp;#x200B;

As the storm finally closed in and we started healing, they dropped out of the sky and shot us. We saw they had a choppa (previously silent and invisible) and a grapple gun. We watched the replay multiple times - and they are nowhere on the map. You can't switch to them, their arrows don't show up.

&amp;#x200B;

After some investigation, I read about the glitch where you can use a grapple gun and a choppa to go higher than the limit and take no damage for the match. This is clearly what happened, and kind of ruined our day. This was going to be our first match of the day where we won with the full squad intact, and that victory was taken by hacking. I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but it's us playing as a family - mom, dad, two kids, and to lose to cheaters is just wrong. We are trying to teach our kids to be good sports and good losers as well as winners, but that's tough to do against cheaters.

&amp;#x200B;

Just keep an eye out, and hopefully a quick fix is on its way. Hopefully the choppa doesn't leave, because we've enjoyed it immensely, besides this.",2,1585442666,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fqwftg/choppa_glitch_needs_immediate_hotfix/,FortNiteBR,0

So as an example, you click on the wall to edit and as well as being able to edit normally, you can also have presets assigned to certain buttons e.g. if you want a door on the push L2 or R2, remove the corner L1 or R1.

I miggt actually have a chance to do an edit in a fight if I could do this plus the button set up for edit mode has only three inputs so doesn't change too much.

Other games on the epic launcher output audio just fine and I am at a loss as to what the reason is for this unless it is something on epic's end.

Guns:
Hand cannon,
Dual pistols,
Bolt snipers,
Heavy shotgun,
Drum gun (non mythic),
Grenade launcher,
Hunting rifle

Items:
Spike traps,
Bouncers,
Clingers,
Stink bombs,
Shockwave grenades,
Boogie bombs,
Air strike

Other:
Golf carts,
Quad crashers,
Vending machines,
Slurp juice,
Chug jugs,

Sometimes it's nearly impossible to find someone who has a mic and skills that match and when you do and play fairly well with them, there should be an option to ready up with the same random squad without having to go back to the menu and add them as a friend.

Even when shooting at the same angle it would not pull a fish after it has grabbed one or it will take multiple tries to pull one fish.

We normally have to go into a game and turn voice chat on and off in settings until we can speak and hear each other but this has not been working recently. We have also checked over the internet for other fixes like turning the console on and off repeatedly but this doesn’t do anything. 

Today I have been in an Instagram call for over an hour trying to fix this and yesterday I was in a call trying to fix this for 2 hours and I don’t understand what the problem is.

fqrdlo,Monkeypod25,Ideas for creative,"Hey so i have a few creative concepts. Unsure if these could be added at all or if theyve already been suggested but.. i thought i'd just mention them

Vehicles-
Be able to change health on vehicles as well as revert them to previous settings. E.g old mech from early season x or old plane from early season 7

Operation assets-
Be able to add assets from operation into creative somehow..? Like faster crouch speed, faster reload time etc. These could be good for different class selections

Some guns that are still missing-
E.g gold dualies and gold silenced pistol. It would be cool to select them in creative again. Also maybe if there was a way to get old gun settings..? Like the deagle when it could 1 shot wooden walls or the old long range ( op ) combat shotgun.

Add preset maps for if people want to make certain gamemodes-
I'm not actually sure if this is in or not. Maybe there could be a way to add maps that spawn in assets to set up games, so people have an accessible way to easily make gun game or team deathmatch maps etc

I've probably forgotten mostve my ideas but.. i hope some of you thought they were decent enough i guess",3,1585425842,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fqrdlo/ideas_for_creative/,FortNiteBR,3

fqr6au,s966666,Valid XP tip from a level 158 who doesent play TR,"Theres a TLDR at the bottom.

Cut a long story short if you prefer to play TR then do so as overall youll earn about 5/6k xp more every 30 mins then the strat im going to mention

But if your a solo/duo/squad typa guy continue to read on 

Duo/squad is horrible for xp let me explain 

DUO&amp; SQUAD if you die 50-100th with 0-2 kills youll get about 800 XP including ammo and chests opened youll get 1.5k. If you spend 20 minutes getting to top 10 with 0-5 kills and die or win youll get around 2k including ammo and chests youll earn around 3.5k to 4k.

So all in all your earning 1.5k for 5-10 mins and 4k for 15-25 minutes.

NOW heres how im leveling up pretty fast SOLO MODE 

If you die 50-100th your earning the exact same as duo/squad around 1.5k but it takes half the time , by the time youve even finished looting 40 people are already dead.

If you finish top 10 your earning about 4-6k because ive noticed solo gives you more survival XP and in solo to get to top 10 your looking at about 10 minutes as everyone seems to die rather fastly.

Now if you finish top 10 , 3 times that is 30 minutes of game time giving you 18k-20k XP in 30 minutes 

Where as if you was to get top 10 3 times in duo or squad your looking at 45 minutes to 1 hour and earning about 12k 

SO PLAY SOLO AND YOU CAN EARN A MINIMUM OF 6-10K XP MORE IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES LESS

Adding on the 30 minutes youve saved BOOM youve earned about 20k XP more.

TLDR; just play solo to get double if not triple the amount of XP compared to duo/squads within a certain timeframe.",1,1585425208,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fqr6au/valid_xp_tip_from_a_level_158_who_doesent_play_tr/,FortNiteBR,3

fqq1vo,Luckiesty,How can you guys still play Fortnite?,"Now, the main reason I ask this question, is purely out of curiosity.

  
A quick and compressed story time,

I started playing Fortnite around the Halloween update in 2017, I didn't care of winning, more of just messing around.

However, I quit in Season 3, but to this day I don't know why.

I came back in Season 5, and I've been playing it ever since,

But in Chapter 2 Season 2, the game is just dry for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I even asked my friends who used to play Fortnite, they said: ""The game is right now very boring, sure the new POI's are cool, but the game isn't the same.""

And now they're playing GTA V and CS:GO.

&amp;#x200B;

fqq1qc,1s1up,My opinion on Fortnite pushing both competitive and fun.,"In my opinion, Fortnite should stop focusing on competitive and start focusing on making their game fun. I feel they tried to do that in season X but they got destroyed by everyone because ""it's not good for competitive."" To me, season X was trying to push fun over competitive. But it failed. Season 11 came out and people hated it because it was boring. Now I don't know if you guys know about this but competitive needs balance/consistency to be fair. I feel like most people believe this to be true but also want to have a ton of fun stuff thrown into the game to ""spice things up."" You can not have both a game that has a ton of updates and a game that's consistent for pros. I feel like Fortnite tried to do this thinking that this was true but now they regret that decision because a ton of pro are now playing for money and not because of it being fun.",3,1585421569,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fqq1qc/my_opinion_on_fortnite_pushing_both_competitive/,FortNiteBR,3

* I set up a fortnite profile in the Logitech software G  Hub so yes this should override everything else, in theory, right?

Sometimes I log on and they work great, sometimes all but the ""1"" button works. Outside of game the buttons work perfectly fine, so it's definitely some kind of key binding issue.

 Or we could also  do it like in the earlier chapter 1 seasons, enlightened skins should be able to continue progression after the season ends so you can unlock the final style without taking multiple hour out of your day. this will still leave the banners for each season as a rare and targeted item for passionate players.

fqocvw,headassboi_123,One thing that confuses me about this community...,"...is that every time you guys die, it's ALWAYS a ’240 FPS PC sweat’. Without fail. 

Let me tell you something, not every player that kills you has the best rig on the planet. Not every player that kills you spends 8 hours a day smoking Adderall on creative. A small percentage of PC players are actually playing above 60 FPS. Even less are playing at 240 frames. I bet at least some of you are getting shit on by console players. 

But why do you guys constantly use this as an excuse? Here's why: it's a crutch that you guys use because you don't want to take responsibility for your deaths. You don't want to review your own gameplay and think about YOUR mistakes and improve from there. That takes too much effort. It's always someone else’s fault. Cos that's easier than taking accountability.

Do a little damage and you get a medal, it's distracting and gets in the way. Leveling up, it's very distracting and gets in the way even more. The worst part is, visual sound effects get covered up by these. All this during the chaos of Team Rumble is just stressful. Teammates gunshots show up on your Sound effect wheel + constant gliders visual sound effects + leveling up + medals = I can't see what I'm supposed to be doing. If Epic doesn't want to remove the animations, maybe make them smaller and put them in the corner. Or give us the option to turn them off.

I love these achievements.Here are a list of all first achievements in the beginning of the season:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ECHAi4mXo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ECHAi4mXo)

What is new since the update:

The achievement ""Pescetarian"" (Ate 50 Slurpfish) was removed and replaced to the achievement ""Pescetarian"" (500 Health or Shield with Slurp Fishes).So great to see that Epic works on it.I also did Liquid Gold and ""If it fits, I sits"".These two old achievements are now working too.Flying the new helicopter is also an achievement.There is also 1 and 10 Wins achievement in the first new mode.

There is also 1 Win achievement in the second new mode (Operation: Knockout).  
I did not reach 10 wins in the newest mode with quarter final, semi final and final. Did anyone reach here 10 Wins and get an achievement for this?

Lets talk about the achievement here in the post and update if there is sth new.  


 

Win Operation: Knockout

fqnhbt,IOnlyPlayAsGuaco-,My very good idea for a new gamemode in fortnite,"It would be a gamemode where it’s basically animal crossing / Minecraft meets fortnite where you need to build a home and craft furniture and stuff. You would have a health bar (Minecraft style) and you would need to grow plants like apple trees and palm trees for coconuts, and you would have a stamina bar (legend of Zelda breath of the wild style) and you can get things like backpacks or chests to store more things in, and the storm would move after around a month (not in-game time), causing you to need to rebuild your home. You can invite friends to your island, and just have some fun. You can go to other people’s islands, and you can choose from a total of 5 different island types. You can go underground in a mine to get oats to sell for “knock off vbucks” (because you can’t use it as something to buy skins and stuff) however, you can use it to get emotes, but it’s double the knock off vbucks to get it (example: an emote was 500 vbucks. You would need to pay 1,000 knock off vbucks for it.) you would have a “fortphone” to call over a friend (invite them to your island) or take a photo or video on it. You can also see all of the fruits you’ve collected and challenges for knock off vbucks.

I was hacked at the end of season 1 and recently got my account back (I   actually got hacked, not a joke) and because of it I missed getting   Sorana and some alter ego styles.

Is   it possible, AT ALL, for epic to reimburse me with those styles? It's   sad that because of something that is not in my control I lost value   from my battlepass. I have completed every single challenge from season 4   - season 10 and it is an awful feeling knowing you missed it because  of  something that is not your fault.

fqldw4,Driftplays2219,Fortbytes: why they are absolutely incredible and arguably the best way to earn secret skins and how can they do it with the different seasons,"NOTE: I feel very ashamed but I actually started in season X so I have no idea how hard are fortbytes thank you I had to address that.

Hello guys and we're back with another discussion, with deadpool coming literally next week I think the challenges are quite simple, but then my friend told me fortbytes were easier and I have to agree. here's why

1. promotion to complete challenges for cosmetics for fortbytes: I noticed a lot of the fortbytes need cosmetic stuff like Vendetta, Rox and more in the battle pass and to earn that obviously you need XP, you earn XP through missions so they are \*forced\* to do them so it's an absolutely great way to do that
2. that was the only time when peace was made in a certain area:  that's harmony I would like to say
3. it's not really skill based: tbh all of them aren't but this is not required to be good, it's required for you to be high level of XP. 
4. People loved singularity: she's overall a really nice skin, and with fan favourite styles she's getting the hype
5. it's super simple: tbh you could just go to a TR game with people and see where most of them are as teammates

NOW the fun part, how can it happen

1. for season X it could be rift zone fragments or the scientist's armour, and if you unlock a certain amount of them you unlock the scientist or a new rift zone perhaps like stary suburbs or gotham (tbh if that actually happened I would purposefully ignore fortbytes)
2. for season 11 it could be weapon parts for sorana, the weapon parts should be what a gold burst looks like, too bland? ok fine what about a ALTER logo
3. for season 12 we should have intel as those items, it would make the intel locations super crowded and maybe have players close to it also have them! awesome idea

I play on PC but with the scuf controller infinity 4ps which has 2 paddles.
I would like to change binds couse I don't feel comfortable.
Rn I play like this: 
L3: edit 
Left paddle: jump
Right paddle: switch mode
Triangle: toggle pickaxe 
R3: crouch

In the edit I use:
R1: select
R2: confirm
L2: reset 

While for building they are the same as pro building

Oh and I use my left forefinger for L2 and L1 and the left middle finger for the left paddle while i use my right forefinger for R1, the middle finger for R2 and the right ring finger for the right paddle

I feel uncomfortable when I have to switch mode and place a wall so I was thinking about change my wall bind but I have no ideas and also I can't find any online.

Not even a slow down. Trying to shoot even just AI bots at mid to Long Range was the most painful unenjoyable experience ever. Now try that on real players on SBMM and it’s a disaster.

The game I play are Rocket League. Chess on lichess. Counterstrike Go. Starcraft 2. Magic the gathering online. And fortnite. 

EVERY SINGLE game is capable of giving me a ranking, showing it to me, and pairing me vs people of rankings that are like mine. 

fortnite isn't. 

Every game I feel like my partners are mostly complete trash who can't even land at the same spot as the team and 100% don't have functional microphones, and the people I run into are literally TFUE and are editing like an AI on crack. 

I've had multiple times where I felt the person who eliminated me was exceptional and looked up their stats and found them to be in the top 50,000 of all players in the world, where I am ranked in the millionths. 

and it doesn't even TELL ME my ranking in the game, or the person who eliminated me. Like why the fuck not? if you have SBMM, why not say ""you are rank SILVER - Rating 7437 and the person who killed you is GOLD rating 8234"" or some shit? is this asking too much? like using any of the BASIC ASS rating systems developed for 50,000 different games and giving a tiny bit of feedback on what is happening is asking for too much? why exactly?",16,1585375744,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fqemps/every_single_other_game_i_play_is_capable_of/,FortNiteBR,1

fqe180,DarthCG,My March Survey Ideas,"Do you guys agree/disagree? How do you feel about the state of the game?

\- Skill based matchmaking ruins every game it touches. You should fix arena mode by giving players incentive to do well (vbucks, cosmetics, leaderboards, etc.), and then public games with be a bit more casual for the players that want that.  

\- Heavy snipers are the most OP gun ever put into the game; I shouldn't be punished for only finding 50 shield and if a player is aggressive instead of camping, they will tend to have less health and die more to heavy snipes. Also, snipers are way too easy to use since bullet drop was reduced. 

\- The new map is too big and the new graphics are worse than chapter one. 

\- There aren't enough fun items in the game anymore like cannons, shopping carts, etc. That's a big reason why people find the game so sweaty. 

\- Competitive needs legitimate separate loot pools. C4, 50 cals, mythics, etc. should not be in comp. 

\- Kills against AI are meaningless and unrewarding. 

\- The loot has been pretty boring. Most players just carry ar/tac/sub/heavy snipe/heals. We need more variations in all loot spawns - not just at new locations. What happened to adding new guns instead of unvaulting old ones?

\- The pump shotgun is in the WORST state it's ever been. A tac shouldn't do more damage, fire faster, AND have a higher mag size. Pump damage needs to be buffed so that rare and above can oneshot and grey/green are still viable. In most cases a pickaxe is better than a grey pump.

Now before i go into my criticism, if you’re gonna try and say stuff like “how does this effect you in real life?” and “why is this so important to you” please shut up like actually get off the internet. I’m heated at the amount of garbage that is on this sub, 9/10 the posts on this sub are actually going to be some crappy post that says something like “Skill based matchmaking bad, soccer skin bad, epic is bad, blah blah blah whatever” in some simple minded meme format so the 9 year olds who hive mind and enjoy this garbage content can process it in their tiny brains. That’s not even it either, there’s the circlejerks around oro and meowscles which get hundreds and thousand of upvotes because again, people on this sub have small brains. This suppresses any good content that exists, like game clips of things that are interesting or really anything creative that hasn’t been posted one hundred thousand times. The 2 posts that really made me want to waste my time typing this were an unrealistic suggestion about how these boomers want to go back in time and another about someone saying they wanted to quit the game and epic were the worst developers because they weren’t listening to you saying you want sbmm gone because you can’t keep up with the skill of the rest of the players on this game. well guess what THEY ARE LISTENING they hear that you guys are complaining about sbmm and they’re probably really sick of it and trying to fix it. If you really want to complain, watch gameplay of save the world. THE ORIGINAL GAMEMODE which was abandoned and left for dead by epic. Maybe a new hero will be added every once in a while and maybe a new gun but doesn’t fix the fact that the game hasn’t had a good update since the halloween event. For what’s been i think 3 years we’ve been stuck with repetitive gameplay and nothing to look foward too since epic has quit developing the mode since no one wants to buy it (probably because of how ass and overpriced it is) What in trying to say in this post is that this sub needs to 1. stop being entitled and think they have it bad 2. think that epic is brain dead and they aren’t listening (to them) 3. and stop circlejerking and posting the same content.

So basically I've been trying to use the 2020 Kickflip for character customization, but for some reason no matter if I save it to one style, it won't work and it will stay on another one, leaving me with only one style to choose.

&amp;#x200B;

If you didn't understand that, here's something simpler.

I have 2 extra styles for my 2020 Kickflip backbling.

I try to choose one style.

But if I save it to that one it stays at another one and can not be changed.

I think that Henchman are epic’s response to the pc sweats complaining about controller aim assist and aimbot and all that crap. I think epic put these bots in the game for the story line but also made them so sneakily good so that every single player will eventually die to them at some point. Then epic can sit back and laugh their ass off. 

Even Fortnite’s top pros have died to these bots because of their insane shot hitting ability. It’s better than player bloom!! Mr. Savage getting wrecked by Brutus, SypherPK getting destroyed by Agency Henchman, and Ninja’s squad getting annihilated by Midas’ drumgun are some of the examples.

fqco1g,Flamingpaper,I'm getting really bored of the Chapter 2 map (map change suggestions),"I really like the Chapter 2 map overall and I love the consistent terrain and the (for the most part) natural feel of the island. However, I'm just super bored with the map and don't like dropping anywhere in particular. I feel like something needs to be done somewhere to make the map more interesting, like a building being destroyed at least partially, or a POI being expanded upon. Here's a list of minor map change ideas I feel could just make the map better.

- Get rid of henchmen from all the spy locations (The Yacht, The Rig, etc.) and leave them to be abandoned and fall apart over time, and or get repaired by some brands on the island on something (The Rig gets taken over by the Slurp Jucie factory and gets rebuilt, for example). The locations are cool, but forcing them to be spy based locations with fancy gimics kind of ruins them. The Shark would be a cool island for a final circle and could be a cool drop spot, given enough loot. The Yacht should also be packed with loot, and being far from the circle would force it to be a duos or squads drop for those that know it inside and out. If this doesn't affect the storyline, the Agency just needs to be destroyed. It looks so out of place, and I think a bunch of holes in it and more chests added could make it a better drop spot.

- Locations need new buildings. I love the progressive map changes we've had for a while, with buildings being under construction instead of appearing from thin air over night. I feel like if we got larger scale buildings, this would be far more interesting, especially in named locations. 

- The house(?) in Sweaty Sands should be completed, but why not start construction on a really big building right next to it and have a few stores across the street? This would make Sweaty Sands more popular, given the locations has enough loot (and or wood pallets)

- The broken house in Salty Springs should be repaired, and should be expanded upon, as well. Give that new section an extra chest, and Salty Springs would be interesting. The broke green house nearby Salty could also be repaired, and become part of Salty, if some nee houses are built between. With Salty being fairly popular, this could make Salty not only be notable, but actually interesting, as every week people could drop in and see how the completely new house is coming along. 

- The Frenzy Farm shack was a cool mini map change, but it's so minor most people likely wouldn't even notice. I feel like we need a few more shacks around Frenzy Farm, mainly in the west. Make a biggish shack with 2 chests total and a mini field outside, and it would expand on the location without completely changing it. Minor changes like this to all locations could make them become loved by players, as I haven't seen many people have a definite favorite location yet. I feel like with just enough changes to locations, like adding a few new shacks and fields around Frenzy Farm could make people like locations more, as they now want to drop there to check out map changes and try out new looting routes.

- Misty Meadows is pretty boring. All the buildings look generally the same from the outside and aren't super interesting on the inside. The buildings should get a few color changes overtime (getting painted) and maybe get a new house built west along the road on the western side. 

- Retail Row is kind of boring, as well. It needs a few more shops. Remember the Pizza Pit and Durrr Burger restaurants from Season 8? Why not add a mini version of Durrr Burger here to compete with the Tacos store, and add a mini Pizza Pit to some other location on the map (maybe Lazy Lake, or just make it take over the diner north of Lazy Lake) then make them become business rivals over time.

- Weeping Woods is just a bit too boring compared to Wailing Woods. I'm not saying we need a bunker, but a hedge maze with loot would be cool. Maybe even make it a little bigger and have more loot. Also the tower should be taller and have more loot (the Lonely Lodge tower was the best structure on the old map and this is a boring replacement).

- The mountains in the southeast are terrible. They're way too hard to scale and are way too high in elevation compared to nearly everything else on the map. I'm not sure how, but they should be destroyed. Maybe an earthquake that causes the entire valley of Shipwreck Cove to fill in with land or something, so the area could be elevated, but not super drastic.

- Pristine Point is a cool mini location, but absolutely no one drops there. It should all just fall down the side of the hill (as it already partially did) and have a giant pile of rubble and loot on the shore. Could be a great way to get wood and stone, given the location is in the path of a looting route.

- Make the storm circle better. I've never had a reason to visit the southern end of the mountains south of Misty Meadows and Apres Ski (dance club). I'd love to have to learn about random new areas of the map, even if only for the end game.


So yeah those were just thoughts I had about the map. I feel that the map is just too big and half the locations aren't interesting enough, even if they're unique. And tons of areas aren't even viable to drop at, even in solos.  I want to love this map, but honestly most of it is super boring and the only places I like are Logjam Woodworks and Camp Cod. I'd love to call a single named location my absolutely new favorite location, but honestly the whole map feels super samey.",11,1585367048,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fqco1g/im_getting_really_bored_of_the_chapter_2_map_map/,FortNiteBR,1

fqchi6,bruhmoment1231231,I can't enjoy the game in its current state.,"I created an account just for this post. 

Lately, since quarantine started, I've been playings lots of Fortnite. Lots. So, as a normal player would, I play lots of solos. There's only one problem; the games are unwinnable. 

I'm not a bad player or a bot. I'm on PC, with ""cracked"" aim, and decent builds and edits. Its just that the game overestimates my potential and puts me in cracked sweat lobbies. The cycle for me goes: Die 4 times in a sweaty lobby to fake defaults, get put down in SBMM and get a win or 2nd place with \~8 kills, go back to sweat lobby, die again. I'm on the very cusp of sweat lobbies and lobbies with players that are worse than me, and it is VERY discouraging being in this area. I seriously have no idea what I can do, or if I can do something. 

TL;DR:   SBMM has ruined my experience, I am in lobbies with much higher skill than I have. The system is unreliable. 

Please tell me your experiences with SBMM, whether it is similar to mine or the exact opposite.",1,1585366300,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fqchi6/i_cant_enjoy_the_game_in_its_current_state/,FortNiteBR,1

fqbwm7,Thelyoness83,Desperate mom needs help,"

Hi, I posted to a different sub and it was recommended that I post here instead. I’ve contacted epic games support repeatedly, but due to coronavirus, they aren’t responding. I’m getting desperate during this quarantine and need help. ***My son currently has his epic games Fortnite account linked to his dad’s PS4. We want to disconnect it from his dads and put him on his own PS4 account. Bc what’s happening is his dad and him cannot play at the same time bc they’re using the same PS4 account/username. (Dad doesn’t play fortnite. He plays madden and call of duty and etc)
I hope this makes sense. 
So my question is how can we get him set up on his own PS4 account and still use his same epic game Fortnite account? He is concerned that by disconnecting from his dads, he will lose all his progress, v bucks, skins, everything. (We have a lot of money spent on this game). ^^^If you can’t tell, I don’t know much about this shit. I’m a Nintendo girl myself. His dad is working 10 states away and can’t help.

fqaaux,JosephStall,Why do unfinished buildings provide cover?,"I’m relatively new to the game. I’ve played before but I’m finally enjoying the game because I’m not as bad. The issue I’m having though is you can get the advantage on someone and have them halfway dead then they throw up a wall. That wall doesn’t need to be finished to provide cover. It provides cover while it’s still blue. Why is that? Shouldn’t you be able to shoot right through it until it’s finished being built? You shouldn’t be able to get cover from a wall until it’s been built. 

Another thing I’ve been having problems with is how do you compete against the people that have clearly played this game way more than I have? How do you counter people that can build a 4 story building in 3 seconds? When I’m up against people that don’t build I win the firefight 90% of the time. When I go against a builder I’m dead.

fq8wvx,Dirty_SteveS,This is what happens when you let business tactics dictate matchmaking,"It’s no secret SBMM is just a short term ploy by Epic to capitalize on the dwindling (now dead) hype behind Fortnite. It’s clear the system only works to benefit newcomers and players on the very low end of the spectrum to keep them happy and buying skins. I wouldn’t doubt if a large group of the player base doesn’t even know it’s in the game. 

But now, the players that were initially benefiting from SBMM are starting to realize that the system is hindering them as they progress through the “tiers”. Soon they will start to quit the game just like above average (not pro) players have been doing.

fq8trr,tanaysharma97,A genuine Thank You to the devs for keeping this game interesting and casual-friendly.,"I've been playing Fortnite Battle Royale since Season 6. I've practically witnessed the game evolve into what it is today. Towards the end of Season X, I genuinely was concerned about the future of the game.
Map was weird, quality of life was poor, everything was all over the place. Still, it wasn't absolute garbage. However, Chapter 2 was a big step and now I find myself enjoying the game more than I ever did in the past year or so.

The 'Agency' has made the game so much more than what it is - NPCs which are quite dangerous, 'bosses' who carry interesting weapons, points of interest which actually feel and look alive. I recently introduced a friend to the game and to my surprise, he's actually enjoying it. Admit it - with all the toxicity and pro players out there, it's tough to get new people hooked to this game. But now, I don't think that's the case.

Sure, the game isn't perfect, but by no means is it ""un-playable"" or uninteresting. The revamped UI/Lobby/Menus are fun to be around too. In my honest opinion, Epic has done a great job maintaining and keeping the game fresh. Generally, that's tough to say that for a game which is 2 years old because of the competition in modern gaming.

Thanks, team Epic.",6,1585352773,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fq8trr/a_genuine_thank_you_to_the_devs_for_keeping_this/,FortNiteBR,1

Far too long have we sat back, watching as the developers and the competitive players lash it put, only to result in greater disdain amidst the community. And now, all we have is a joke. A bug and glitch ridden game with poor gameplay variety and experiences... We have come so far from the once former bliss of this game, that feel it gave us, the memories we have cherished. We have come to the point where the developers do not even trust us with patch notes, or feedback of the current situations...

I say **ENOUGH!** It is time we, as a community, set aside our differences, our opinions and our bias, and looked at the bigger picture. We have lost the voice we once had, the voice that guided the developers where they went wrong, and that gave them original ideas. The voice that gave hope to the smallest concern, the voice that made our relationship special.

No longer shall I watch others suffer under the negligence of Epic Games! This game was once a friendly environment for all players alike... now, we have literal robots with us and players with overwhelming skill you can never possibly hope to match. We have game-breaking glitches, disappointing and surviving bugs, forced cross play, and worst of all, a shattered spark of what once was.

Fight with me, and let us show them that we are part of the game! That we are just as important as the money! Just as important as the fame! Just as important as the title, the gameplay, the experience, the mechanics... The list goes on.

Game 1: Dad doesn't know how to glide. Controls are shown on screen. We go on, Run from storm. I get 7 kills. My brother 2. Dad none. My brother hasn't noticed yet but we are top 10. I spot people and eliminate them. My brother yells for not letting him kill them. We go on. We win and I have 11 kills.

Game 2: Land at retail. Long story short, 3 people squad (me/brother/dad) somehow survive retail row and get 5 kills. My dad gets his first kill. We go and win with me having 10 kills.

Game 3: Land at the grotto, get disguises and I kill Brutus. We use the airtunnel to glide out the zone is a long way. Luckily I have a launch pad. I build a ramp place it and use it. We are in the storm now. My dad runs up the ramp, and right off it. My brother does the same. My brother has played for 6 weeks now btw. I then have to play solo squad with 45 give or take people left. K get beautiful words of encouragement from my brother. ""You won't win, you are not good enough"". Which really motivated me. I have not noticed yet but I have 9 kills and am top 3.
I assume it is one duo left as there is no shooting.
I find one. It's not a duo they just haven't noticed each other. I was very over prepared for a duo fight, getting ready to crank a 90 then head shot them.
Yeah... He wasn't very good. Top 2. Yeah I find him and kill em. The end
11 kills again.

fq747q,stickninja1015,"(Theory) The real meaning of ""Midas' Revenge""","Yaaay another theory about Oro that no one asked for! As I'm sure we all know, Oro is part of the ""Midas' Revenge"" set, which very clearly establishes a connection between Midas and Oro. But, what exactly is this connection? Well, I think I've figured it out.

First of all lets get something out of the way: Midas is not Oro. There's no way Oro's skull could fit in Midas' head. It is much to long. Also, the challenges for Oro is ""Awaken Oro"" and Epic's tweet about Oro's challenge says ""King Oro has awoken"". ""Awoken"" implies that Oro has been asleep and has only recently awoken. Now, this wouldn't make sense if Oro is Midas as Midas is very clearly already awake and active.

Now that is out of the way, onto the main part of this theory. If Oro isn't Midas, then how is he connected to his revenge? Well, the game already gives us that answer. When Oro first released, part of the news tab for him was ""Harness his power and get revenge."" So basically that has given us the answer to how Midas and Oro are connected, and gives a bit of insight on how Midas got his power. Basically, Midas' gold touch is a power he is harnessing from Oro to get his revenge on somebody.",5,1585347273,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fq747q/theory_the_real_meaning_of_midas_revenge/,FortNiteBR,1

fq5qkc,HorrorPositive,Team Rumble idea?,"Alot of people are complaining about team rumble, some done like SBMM and some do. 

Problem in my opinion is when there is SBMM alot of people especially those who are above average and use TR as casual mode don't like that everyone is over build like it world cup, and it's get tiresome because you can play casual and you are forced to either build like opponent or stay low and have no action. And in the end TR safe zone becomes over crowded with build and its hard to even meet find people unless you build on top which makes TR even more over crowded with build. 

When there isn't SBMM low end play get destroyed because people way better then then just keep build over them and have high ground almost all the time, so below average players are either on the ground and hide or they try to glide into opponent which makes opponent build even higher to get high ground. And in the end its same as SBMM where TR gets over crowded with build and you can't find nor fight anybody because most of times you are searching for a opponent.

What i propose is keep SBMM but make it so that every 30s or so every build piece on the map gets destroyed, similar like few seasons ago where in last circle every build in zone was destroyed. With that TR won't get over crowded with builds, people can still build if they want but they need to start over every 30s or so. So with SBMM above average players can still build but it won't turn into end game build chaos so it will promote more ground fights, and below average players who don't build that much makes no difference because their map doesn't get crowded that much.

TDLR: Make so that every 30s all player builds are destroyed (similar to few season end zone mechanics). This proposal is more for above average players, while making no difference to below average players.

fq55dm,8-Bit-Oddish,How supercharged xp actually works.,"Supercharged Xp is not an event on weekends. Instead it is a system meant to allow players who don't play the game frequently or only play on weekends (which has created the misconception that it is given to players on the weekend) to level up faster.

Every day players are able to earn up to 10 daily medals for their daily medal punchcard netting them a possible total of 60,000 total xp if they are all completed. However, if a player fails to complete their daily medals or doesn't play that day they will be given supercharged xp the next time they log on as a way to allow them to catch up. This supercharged xp has a set amount equivalent to a percentage of the xp they would have earned had they earned all the medals they missed while they were gone, and can stack across multiple days, it is not clear what or if there is a max limit to supercharged xp. Additionally not only will supercharged xp stack daily, but it appears that the more medals you have missed, the greater the multiplier of supercharged xp will be. If you don't play for a few days you will earn around 3.75-4.25 times as much xp, while if you have missed weeks of medals you will earn over 10 times the regular xp to get you caught up fast. once the player nears passes the amount of supercharged xp they have been given, it will end and your xp rate will return to the way it usually is.

Finally Supercharged xp does not give you xp for your missed daily challenges, and it does not multiply the xp given for completing challenges or earning daily punchcards.",5,1585341386,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fq55dm/how_supercharged_xp_actually_works/,FortNiteBR,1

fq4vtj,ConsumerOfRamen,Something I realized about the End event,"After the Scientist created the big rift that activated the baby rifts, the first rocket to appear was the one above Gotham City. Gotham city used to be Tilted Towers.

In the Season 4 Blastoff event, the Visitor dove toward the ground, aiming above the location Tilted Towers. While he was aiming, he set a targeting laser to help him hit the exact position where he could open a rift.

In Season X, the Scientist places a rift beacon in the *exact* spot the the laser was aiming to. And, in both events, the rockets all disappear once through their rifts and then come back again, and go through another rift to transport the meteor above the Zero Point. The Visitor followed this pattern of disappearing and returning and going through a final rift.

So what I'm trying to say is that that first rocket which came from the Gotham rift was the Visitor. In Season 4, the Visitor time traveled from S4 to S10 to the End event. When he entered the Tilted Rift, he was teleporting to the rift above Gotham. And when he appeared above Moisty and left again at Greasy, he was doing that part in the End where they just zip around for a bit. And when he made the Loot Lake rift, he went to that part where they go around the meteor reeeeaaally fast.

fq4a0l,Th3trotter,We need all of the Weapons in Spy Games in Actual Battle Royale (except ARENA),"There is barely any more variety in terms of weapons (slightly with the introduction of suppressed and the heavy sniper). However, with the introduction of all Spy Games weapons, we could get back to the original BR experience with a variety of weapons to use. These weapons need to return or be added to Battle Royale game modes INCLUDING TEAM RUMBLE (not arena) and here is why:

**Scoped Assault Rifle**

* Despite being balanced now, the new Epic and Legendary versions are actually useful and rack up loads of damage. The weapon has a quick reload with a fire rate of 2 and damage of 32/34/36/38. This weapon can be substituted for a sniper rifle.

**Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle**

* The one sniper everyone dislikes...ish. The Uncommon and Rare versions can't eliminate a player in one hit, but the new Epic version CAN. This could bring up the competition greatly. The Epic Semi-Auto not only has the ability to one-shot players, but it has a higher magazine than other snipers. This weapon can be really great in long-range combat.

**Epic Submachine Gun or the Epic and Legendary Compact SMG**

* There is an Epic SMG in Spy Game when using the Gunsmith perk. This SMG is similar to the Minigun dealing 20 DMG and 12 shots per second, but is useful at close range and has a faster reload. However, the Compact SMG (IN BOTH RARITIES) would be really nice and have a higher magazine and a better range would be better. These two are interchangeable honestly.

**Heavy Shotgun**

* The Rare, Epic and Legendary Heavy Shotguns are insane in Spy Games (because EVERYONE uses it). This weapon needs to return because it can reach farther ranges than that of the other two shotguns, and it is really decent enough to be a balanced weapon. Also, it is competitive against the SPAS Pump Shotgun.

**Rare and Epic Bolt-Action Sniper**

* There you go! The Fabled Bolt-Action Rifle. This NEEDS to return, since the weapon is very good and was used a lot in C2S1. This would serve as a lower tier version of the heavy sniper. All in all, this is really good!

**Epic and Legendary Suppressed SMG**

* **One word...INSANE!** The Epic Suppressed SMG is really good and insane in Spy Games. This weapon needs to come in BR because although having a nerf, 23 damage is still enough to eliminate someone under 9 shots with full HP/Shield. There is an unused Legendary Variant...so...they have plans then...put that in BR too then...

**Hand Cannon**

* The Rare, Epic, and Legendary Handcannon is great among many pistols. It is hard to tell though if the new Legendary pistol is better than this or not, but who cares? The Handcannon is great to use, as it can pop a huge chunk of HP out of the enemy and it was great in BR during S3.

**Epic and Legendary Rapidfire SMG**

* MY GOD! **This is ridiculous!** The DPS of the Legendary variant is 255! I have no words...this is the SMG from the OG Season 1-2 we've *all* been wanting back! This SMG is a great symbolism to the Machine Pistol from Season 1 and 2. It has the same fire rate and damage output! This needs to be in BR honestly...

**Common and Uncommon Suppressed Pistol**

* Apparently, there is a tech that makes a pistol suppressed and therefore there is a Suppressed Pistol in the lowest two rarities...uh...I guess they can be good for battle? Let me know in comments!

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know which one you want in BR and have a great day! If you know an EPIC employee or Partner, encourage then to take this idea...It could solve all of our vague problems finally with more variation in BR.",12,1585338819,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fq4a0l/we_need_all_of_the_weapons_in_spy_games_in_actual/,FortNiteBR,1

I bought the battle pass thinking it was good when i first saw it but looking back at it its really not that great (besides calamity and flamenco lol) Another thing is this season didnt do anything. Every season we getting big changes to gameplay like the Season 4 hop rocks that make you jump high and get alittle speed. Season 5 we got rifts AND atks which mainly helped getting youre squad get away from the storm AND a new poi, Paradise palms (oh and lazy links...) Season 6 we got shadow rocks which are basically hop rocks but... you are invisible and can go through things. I mean they arent bad but no one really uses them besides for mobility, and map changes are just the runes, small castle near haunted hills, fields at fatal, leaky lake, floating island, and some small things that are really . Cool but most of the map changes are just changes and not new things besides the castle at haunted which i really hoped was a new poi and way bigger. Gameplay is the same as the half end of season. Nothing suprising or big tbh. It took freaking 3 weeks for epic to release an ltm which imo was really fun but the fact that you dont get xp for winning or anything else to keep you motivated to win in this ltm is what really made this ltm boring and not fun. I mean you could go for kills but apparently 8 kills gets you 100 xp and 11 kills gives you 80..? wtf? Idk if this is a bug (really hope also fix plz) so i dont even bother trying to get kills when xp for kills are randomized (correct me if im wrong) And no one dances on the point because theyre out there for kills.

fq3ygn,Parbelenos,How I believe Epic could make Team Rumble better.,"***Before I start I'd like to point out to the fact that this is my opinion and I believe you have the right to agree or disagree so PLEASE stay civil in the comments and don't attack people that disagree with you.***

***Criticism is very much welcome so feel free to give me your piece of mind.***

&amp;#x200B;

As a pretty casual player I tend to play Team Rumble quite a lot, as time passed changes were made and not many things *really changing*, so I've started thinking of a few ways Epic improve it as a gamemode overall so here's a few ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

There is literally no downside to overbuilding to the point that some group of players could just camp on top of them shooting down defenseless gliding players. 

*(Until someone gets lucky enough to catch them off guard by dropping on them.)*

This one is going to be pretty controversial because one of the obvious ways to work against that would be to disable infinite redeploy gliders. 

Unvaulting vehicles like the Quadcrashers, Driftboards, ATKs and Choppers could give back some mobility options for rotations and people doing challenges.

Even limited use redeploys could be unvaulted.

&amp;#x200B;

Spawn points are extremely inconvenient most of the time, when one of the team is dominating another they'll start shooting people trying to glide down back to the battlefield.

I believe a good way to work this one out is giving players the choice of where they can spawn.

\&gt;Gliding or directly on the floor.  
\&gt;Location A, B, C, D which you'd have to chose, being based on the position of teammates in the zone.

*(If none are available then a random spawn would occur.)*

&amp;#x200B;

Unbalanced Teams, I don't even need to explain that one everyone has experienced it at one point.

I believe an auto balance system could help with that issue.

*(If a player gets auto balanced they could gain a boost of experience at the end of the match)*

&amp;#x200B;

*This is pretty much all I can think of for now, if you have some ideas feel free to add them in the comments.*

&amp;#x200B;

Today i began a match, I was able to do some missions in solo, the idiotic sistem that you have in this game showed that I've reached level 53 on the battle pass. All good until I got in the lobby and it showed me only level 50. I got out of game, and after 1 hour i got back and guess what? I am level 49. How is this even possibly? I reported the bug ingame so don't ask for more informations, for now I am waiting an reply to the email that I sent when I saw that.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, what is wrong with your servers? I live in Romania, I have the best offer for the internet that is available in my country, 940mb/s download 450 mb/s upload. I live alone, I am connected trough cable not playing the game with the wifi on... and have 50 ping on Europe? What the actual fuck? What should I do to play this game not on 0 ping, but at least on 10-15? I understand that a lot of people in this period are playing but the problem is not recent, i have the same problem since the last major update, when the season changed.

I've seen all the memes, heard all the jokes. '...Fortnite bad.' but I just started playing since day one of Chapter 2 Season 2 (and the Fortnite ""celebs"" don't help it's image in my eyes either), and it's been nothing but exhilarating and fun!

Piecing together the story of Midas, and ghost vs. shadow had been extremely fun. So much so that I decided to buy the battle pass; something I thought I'd NEVER do, yet here I am at level 92 and grinding for Midas. Thank you, Epic, and don't listen to those streaming fools. You are making games that people like me love, and I can't thank you enough, especially during a quarantine such as this. No game is perfect, but all I know is, I've been having tons of fun.

Keep moving forward as only Epic can! Thank you again for hours upon hours of great times!

I cannot play on my PC as it is not powerful enough to run Fortnite. If I were to play on my PC I would be able to afford the battle pass (Earning 200 V-Bucks from what's left of the battle pass)

However, I am concerned that I would not be able to afford the battle pass after grinding for days to come, as I am scared that my 750 will be overwritten by the 600 if I were to earn more. So instead of having 950 I'm scared I'll end up with 800.

In this two weeks os quarentine (im from spain, since march 12th i dont go out) i have experience the worst times playing the game. Every squad game is incredibly difficult to do something. I play with friends who are even more casual players than me and they dont know how to edit and are very  bad at building, even tho i am quite good at both we always get destroyed by a swaety. No chance, 2 minutes of fight and its over. 

i know it is because of the ""skill based match making"". I have a way higher account level than them and these squads we ran into are far apart from their level and even mine.

these last two days we quit playing after maybe 1h and 1/2, because we simple dont have fun. its not funny to play 8-9 games in an hour just because there that amazing skill level difference between us.

At this point i dont know what could be done. I really thing that multiplatform should be an option and not obligatory if you want to play. At the beginning was great but now the difference between an average player on console and a pc player its overwhelming. The other option could be to revert this matchmaking system and bring back the old one.

I dont wanna sound with this post as a baby crying because he doesnt win o something like that, its a true feeling of dissapointment with how this have evolved and the current state of the game.

this is the game with i had the most fun of my life, but this fun and happiness is slowly converting into stress, apathy and reluctance...

Please do something for casual player and PUBS because it is no longer funny....

(sorry if the grammar its not perfect)

hope someone reads it, have a great day",18,1585331386,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fq1q37/fortnite_is_unplayable_right_now_it_is_no_longer/,FortNiteBR,2

fq0bf1,Kodak_V,Fortnite isn't fun on consoles anymore.," Me and my friends have been playing Fortnite since Season 5, and have been fairly enjoying the game. We are pretty mediocre as players,but we have fun nonetheless.
We all played from PS4, so we usually got paired up with other console players. We would usually get 1 win in about each 5-10 matches, because as i said, we were nothing special as players. Each of us would usually get from anywhere from 1-4 kills per match. 
I didn't really play in Season X because i was on Vacation,and so i was really excited when Chapter 2 began. 
And in the begining we all were. Some of my friends really liked SBMM and the addition of bots since they were ""easy kills"" as they described it,and some hated those additions. I was more or less indifferent. 
The new map was fresh and simple, i liked that you could find Green Snipers and Bazookas since weapons like these help console players quite a lot.
But Season 2 is unplayable.
I know a lot of you will probably say ""crybaby console player"" and you will probably be right,but hear me out.
I have had disliked quite a few things Epic had done in the Past (Like the Mechs,the Combat etc) but none of them have caused us such dismay. The game was still playable, despite our personal gripes with it.
But Forced Crossplay is honestly too much. 
No matter how you look at it, PC players will *ALWAYS* have an advantage over Console players. Easier and faster aim, faster and more comfortable building and editing, much higher FPS, Shadow and Graphic settings customisation the list goes on.
I don't to want to sound dismissive but i have tried playing Fortnite in my cousin's computer and the difference is HUGE. While on console i would get a win in one out of five/ten matches, on PC i got 3 back to back wins in the five games i played,and in the other two i finished Top 5 easily,with more than 7 kills to my name. 
I could build,aim and edit like I've never dreamt. The gameplay was smooth as silk due to the higher frame-rate and there was practically no lag.
I do not say this to diminish PC players, just to point out some differences between PC/Consoles.
With that being said, playing constantly against PC gods who can destroy you before you realise what is happening is incredibly frustrating.
The fact that Forced Crossplay is a thing is really shit imo. 
Out of my friends most of them switched from PS to PC and some others quit the game entirely. 
A game they had been playing for a very long time.
I can't personally afford a good PC, but i don't want to quit the game.
I have seen similar opinions here on Reddit and Epic really doesn't take these statements into consideration.
And yes i realise this is a problem for me and not everyone else,and that Epic isn't forced to listen to what we say, but still, it is disheartening.
The fact that SBMM clearly doesn't work doesn't make the situation easier.
Before,i would actually have fun when playing , now it feels like a chore.

fq09pf,LockedSentry,Fortnite is a rip-off,"I’m not saying it’s a bad game, I myself play it. But I saved up so many v-bucks and used so much time to get the battle pass and I did. I made it to 1,700 v-bucks and I had used my refund tokens already. My sister comes up to my controller while I’m using the bathroom and purchases a 1,500 v-buck glider (Skellon) which I had no interest in. I contact epic games and they tell me there is nothing they can do about. Such a waste of time.

fpzvbd,Bfs162006,Why Fortnite is kinda lacking these days,"I think Fortnite is losing its spark for many reasons. Here are some examples.

The game seems like it’s changed from its T rating to a E10+ rating. The game feels like it’s meant for kids now, not any age. The game feel too childish, with the colors and all, and the weapons look kinda plastic.

The game’s skins. Fortnite made so many skins and emotes in Chapter 2 that I swear are just for the money, and lacking in creativity. Skins such as: ALL THOSE GREEN SKINS THAT WERE JUST DEFAULT SKINS WITH A CAMO JACKET OR SOMETHING. Not to mention that the female skins don’t use the same body as before. Emotes have changed. They used to come out with great and fun dances, but now we get garbage dances. The Chapter 1 Season 2 Battlepass is so much different from Chapter 2 Season 2 Battlepass emotes. In Chapter 1, we had the worm and the floss, in Chapter 2 we have the Honk Honk emote and the Pandemonium emote. I think they are setting their expectations to make good green and blue rarity items, but they don’t make any epic or legendary items as much as they used to anymore. Another one are the amount of dual pickaxes they have. Yes, we like them, but we don’t need 3 dual pickaxes for every normal pickaxe in a update!

Besides that, I think the thing that the thing people don’t think of, but is a major factor is that it’s straying away from the game that made Battle Royale happen, STW. The game doesn’t feel or look the same way anymore. If you took out the skins and stuff in either mode, they would be unrecognizable from each other. From the font to the locker redesign to the terrain, they have all changed. The skins don’t share game modes anymore, and now, we have this thing where you can use any BR skin in STW, and honestly I’m cool with that, but the locker redesign looks wrong in the STW lobby. The game has lost its origins, and has strayed too far from what created it.

If the game could just slowly start coming back to STW, I think this game would be a lot better.
