Can I drink COVID-19 sneeze?,"I read articles that say takeout food is safe (when packaging is appropriately handled) because coronavirus doesn‚Äôt do well on food (it is heated and can be re-heated), and coronavirus does not survive the GI tract.

According to one article ‚Äúfood is going to go straight down into your stomach where there is a high acidity, low P-H environment that also will inactivate the virus‚Äù

But don‚Äôt we breathe momentarily while we chew or eat? If someone sneezes or handle the food with ‚Äúsneeze hands,‚Äù might we not then breathe that in? Or is that just extremely unlikely? How susceptible to heat is COVID-19? Can I drink COVID-19 sneeze and be ok?

Takeout *food* is safe articles:

fruw7q,Ugly-Kid-Chris,ELI5: How does buying new shares of mutual funds work?,"I understand a fair amount about how markets, funds, etc. work. 

I understand that a company will issue a certain number of shares of stock and whenever that stock is traded it's just a previously issued share trading at the current market price.  I also understand that mutual funds are made up of securities including but not limited to stocks and bonds.  The ""value"" of a mutual fund is it's net asset's value, NAV, which is calculated when markets close by adding up everything the fund owns and dividing by the amount of issued shares.  If a fund owns $1B of assets and there are $1M of shares issued then each share is worth $1,000.

But how does buying new shares work?

For example if a fund is just 100% Microsoft stock and it closes at $160 today then when I buy into a mutual fund are they just buying a proportional amount of shares in Microsoft the next day?  If so, how do they price it?

What I mean is Microsoft might close today at $160 a share but something might happen after hours to cause the value to surge so when markets open up the next day it's trading for $300 a share.",1,1585588662,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/fruw7q/eli5_how_does_buying_new_shares_of_mutual_funds/,explainlikeimfive,1

Hi Everyone,

ELI5 is looking for new moderators.

There is no pay. You can expect people to be rude to you. People will blame you personally for actions you take that are entirely in line with the subreddit rules. There is no personal glory, and you can't use your position to cross promote yourself, your personal projects, or your other subreddits.

The only redeeming quality is that get help the community out, as a whole. If that sounds like a position you're interested in, we'd love to hear from you.

Fill out this form: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco15PkYkdorszJHRQ6\_0DPNDfhIl62Kh68mO1EDTiE9jSvmQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco15PkYkdorszJHRQ6_0DPNDfhIl62Kh68mO1EDTiE9jSvmQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

If you have any questions before you apply, please put them in this thread.

We don't know what kind of demand we'll have, so we can't promise an individual response for every applicant.

I'll also use this thread as a brief opportunity to plug [/r/ideasforeli5](https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasforeli5), where any ideas for eli5 are presented directly to the moderators and for public discussion.

(Obviously Rule 3 doesn't apply in this thread, the only real rules are try to stay mostly on topic and Rule 1 is never waived, so be nice!)

Why ROBOT shouldn't pay taxes? (\*\*my thought and I know too less about taxation...just felt curious on the issue and find out 'why' from the one who knows these stuff better)  
1. They don't earn that's why there is no possibility of unequal wealth distribution which is a major reason people pay tax.  
2. They don't represent any nation(no reason to protect sovereignty and country's defense) and they use too little social/public facility which a government provides through tax.  
3. The workplace-robot shows almost no(at the end consumer wins) public threat to discourage people to implement the use of it(reflecting on tax on a commodity that shows threat like alcohol, tobacco).

Also, some reactions like dinitrogen pentoxide and the thermal decomposition of nitrogen look very similar in that they both have the same coefficient for the reactants in the balanced chemical equation but have different reaction orders? I'm thinking it's because one of them might be an elementary reaction whereas the other isn't but not really sure.

Nobody can predict the future. This is about trends. I'll use imaginary index funds. I want to keep the numbers as oversimplified as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say I want to buy stock. Stock ABC is an index fund tied to the S&amp;P and has a 7% growth rate over ten years. It gives no dividends

But stock XYZ is a high dividend index fund and has a 5% growth rate, but a 2% dividend. And this is considered high, even though if I had invested in the stocks within it, I'd be getting 5-8% dividends.

Where do I even start to compare the numbers? 

Is there something about the dividend that inhibits growth in the long term, so that I, as a holder of XYZ fund, would get whatever ""falls of the tree,"" and it more or less is even with ABC stock had I reinvested it? 

In an index fund, the ""expense ratio"" is how much the fund itself takes off the top for the service of indexing the fund for you (saving you a bunch of time and mitigating the risk factors).

fr6ecj,Alchymia_,The debate about economy/health in regards to the Coronoavirus and a lockdown of society,"So there's lots of discussion here in Scandinavia about the potential economic effects of putting the country on lockdown, contrasted with the potential death rate. There's also lots of strong opinions on the balance between health and economy, often from people I wouldn't expect it from. At the same time Sweden and Norway are trying slightly different strategies, and everything has become extremely confusing and hard to understand.

The main argument I often hear is that people are worried that the economical effects will eclipse the immediate effects of the virus, and therefore we should open up society to a bigger degree. On the opposite side people are saying that the pressure on the health care system might be crazy and produce an even worse economical effect.

Hopefully I could explain this okay, but it's a very difficult situation, and I'm finding it hard to even ask the question in a good way. I think what I'm asking is something like:
How can opening up society help the economy, if this leads to extreme pressure on the health care syatem and lots of people becoming sick at once? As I understand it the researchers don't know if you even gain immunity for a longer time after recovering, and are generally very uncertain about aspects of the virus, so wouldn't this be an extreme risk?",1,1585490884,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/fr6ecj/the_debate_about_economyhealth_in_regards_to_the/,explainlikeimfive,1

fr60yc,agathokakologicalme,ELI5 why I have hallucinations while awake at night?,"Hi All!
Not sure this is the right subreddit to post this, but I'm generally perplexed about the whole thing, so I hope you'll excuse me if it's not.
What I would like receive an explanation on, is whether having some kind of hallucinations during the night is normal, and what this phenomenon can actually be called. I'm not talking about lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis or monstrous hallucinations in any way. 
I'll start from the beginning: I am used to getting very few hours of sleep (usually go to bed anywhere from 1 to 3am and wake up at 8, 8.30am). I know perfectly well this is not healthy and working on it, thanks to being in lockdown. 
One thing I have noticed and that I'll mention because it could be useful to explain what I'm trying to find an explanation for is how, when I get a full night of sleep (usually above 7 and a bit) I can recollect my dreams, something that doesn't happen when I sleep 6 or less hours. 
Now this leads me to the actual issue: whenever I get a WHOLE night of sleep (I'm talking above 8 hours) or when I go to bed early (around 11pm or 12, which is quite early for my aforementioned standards), I will have trouble sleeping the whole night in one go and sometimes wake up at around 3am or 4am. 
This is were things get weird for me. What happens is that I am awake and conscious of being in that state (I can move without any issues). Obviously I will be trying to doze off again, but I will sometimes have some kind of hallucination (calling it like this for lack of better terms). 
One example could be me thinking I still hadn't gone to sleep at all and that I had been texting with someone until that moment (I once had this in regards of my crush) and had whole convo with said person (i could literally see the convos in my mind, knowing what I had allegedly said and their answers), and then being sure that said person still hadn't answered me, and worrying about that. It usually revolves around me speaking through social media to someone. 
Last night I thought I had sent a text to a friend of mine and I was convinced I was holding my phone. Having had various of these episodes, that usually are all about sending rude/blunt responses to people (something I would never do irl), I am now accustomed to somehow snap out of it, which is what I did this time. I didn't even flinch or check my phone, because I was sure it had been placed far away from my bed and in airplane mode. 
These events are not particularly troubling, but they do spoil my sleep, as the majority are all about some kind of anxious situations I have caused that would lead to me checking compulsively whether that was the actual reality or not (other examples involved exams being held and be stressing about that, or posting inappropriate content online, etc,). 
If it can be of any help I do not use any kind of drugs, nor I am a habitual drinker or smoker. 
One thing that might be linked is me having closed eye hallucinations. I have always level 1, and level 2 and 3 are quite common (so much so that they can prevent me from sleeping because of how colourful the patterns get) , with sometimes level 4 making an ""appearance"".
Could someone more knowledgeable than me in this field explain what is happening exactly?",1,1585489155,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/fr60yc/eli5_why_i_have_hallucinations_while_awake_at/,explainlikeimfive,1

fr077s,TSA1984,ELI5: why is footage with CG effects more difficult to remaster in HD?,"Both *Star Trek* the original series and *The Next Generation* have been remastered in HD, but the mid-90s Trek shows *Deep Space 9* and *Voyager* have not. [This article](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/03/these-machine-learning-enhanced-clips-might-be-our-only-chance-of-seeing-hd-star-trek-voyager-any-time-soon/) implies that the reason is those shows involved more CG, which makes the process more complex.   

Now, I would've thought it would be the opposite. When remastering live-action or practical effects footage, wouldn't you encounter the [Enhance button](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhanceButton) problem? Basically that you can't enhance an image to be more detailed than it was before, as that would involve adding or assuming information. Whereas, couldn't CG footage simply be rerendered in higher definition?    

I don't understand why CG would be *harder* to remaster.   

Come to think of it, I don't really understand the visual remastering process with regards to non-CG footage either.   

A friend of mine in the industry is quite excited about machine learning AI algorithms that have been able to remaster footage from the 1890s into 4K. I can see these powerful cutting-edge programs being able to make the kinds of assumptions and extrapolations that would be required to overcome the Enhance Button problem. And the article says that fans are making their own *Voyager* And *DS9* remasters using similar AI technology. 

But I remember my *Star Wars* VHS tapes from 1995 having ""remastered"" written on them; how was that possible? And how would it have been somehow more difficult if *Star Wars* had had CG effects?",1,1585457777,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/fr077s/eli5_why_is_footage_with_cg_effects_more/,explainlikeimfive,1

How does such information, say, of an 8 bit image converted into electric signal in a pixel? are they add up incrementally so that we can view not just one color, but millions of them on our display?

For something to be soap, sodium hydroxide seems to be the main active ingredient.

Even my multi purpose spray and my disinfectant had this in it but at different amounts: from memory the disinfectant was 1.0w/w. I'd love for that to be explained too.

So I guess I'm asking if benzalkonium chloride is going to the the same as something like sodium hydroxide? Is there anything we should be steering clear of?

I have noticed there are plenty differences, which can be categorized:

a) switch from imperial metric with international system:
I guess the guy who's translating is to lazy to make the conversion, and thinks is not relevant to the plot.

b) say the opposite:
""drink this"" vs ""not drink this""
I guess the guy who's translating just didn't hear the prahse well and he's not paying attention to the plot.

c) random number change

audiio: ""take 20 step forward""
subt: ""take 3 step forward ""

I live in Bangladesh and here the whole country is in lockdown. From government offices, to private offices, to shops everything is locked down. People cannot go outside their homes. 

I have heard that something similar is in effect in India as well where the whole country is under lockdown. 

* My question is, in such countries how are the basic essentials of daily living produced? 

* Also how will such basic need goods be produced and supplied in the long run?

For instance, for food supply, you will need a large number of farmers and farmhands to produce and process food. That would mean a large number of gathering of people. And people are forbidden from going out let alone large gathering. 

Then you have things like clothing which you can't have if the markets and tailors are closed. 

Then for shelter, for those with own homes they can stay there. But tenants have to pay rents and a lot of tenants cannot if they themselves cannot work. More importantly, what about the huge number of homeless people?

The CDC has a chart breaking out [annual estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) of people who get infected from the flu that says 9M-45M people get the flu each year, which results in 140K-810K hospitalizations and 12K-61K deaths.

So far this [flu season](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates), the CDC estimates there have been 38M-54M flu cases with 400K-730K hospitalizations and 24K-62K deaths.

But I still admittedly do not realise the actual factors that involve in order to produce this estimation. Or the full process of ventilator systems in hospitals in general. Things I'm currently hypothesising as to reasons why is as follows:

* The the number of severe cases is predicted to exponentially grow
* Ventilator systems for a patient need to be changed every 2-3 days to avoid bacteria contamination. And it's going to take some time to decontaminate them, so having clean extras is useful.
* Also because of the above it will help reduce cross contamination between patients.

How does state statutes, codes and regulations supersede the constitutions? Like how  can a state corporation bring charges against you, if there is a no victim, find you guilty of said charge then tell you, your constitutional right to bear arms is no longer?

 or am i just looking at all of this wrong?

- the fan will die because they are cheap and it is hard for it to force air into it when there is no escape.

I tried to roll hand/feet hole on itself and to clap it to remove this from the possibility list.
And yet it is still working fine.

So either the plastic material is not fully air thighs (but enough that humidity won't come out :( )

Or (unlikely), there is a sort of air valve somewhere.

I was alone in my home and it was pitch black except for my bedroom. It was about 11pm and i was playing video games and decided to head to the kitchen for a snack. I have to walk past my living room to get to the kitchen and I enjoy the darkness so didn‚Äôt turn any lights on. As i was walking past my living room I noticed a light emitting from the back of my living room about 20ft away from me. I stopped walking and noticed a shining ball about the size of a basketball. It glowed gently and was not blinded but was a cool light that was dazzling. It floated completely quietly about 6ft off the ground. I stared at it for about 8 seconds. I wasn‚Äôt scared but i was confused and couldn‚Äôt understand what i was looking at. 

Suddenly after 8 seconds it flew towards me and entered my chest. I felt nothing but i then quickly turned around to see where it flew to but it did not exit.

I appreciate jokes and funny comments but I‚Äôm desperate for any insight anyone may have. I can‚Äôt bring this up at work as they‚Äôd probably investigate my mental health and wouldn‚Äôt believe me.  I don‚Äôt have contacts within academic circles and I‚Äôm not interested in conspiracy theories. My running thought is accepting that there may be beings or objects we have yet to discover which can eventually be fully explained but just currently lack the science.

fpq9ip,FairWeather01,Why are we making everyone self isolate from COVID-19 instead of a more strategic response?,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I am sheltering in place. ¬†I don‚Äôt think people should die to preserve the economy.¬† 

  
But I wonder if there‚Äôs not a smarter way to protect the at-risk as while we get people working again? Is it just because we aren‚Äôt organized enough? 

  
COVID-19 disproportionately causes more severe illness and higher mortality as age increases. It also disproportionately affects those that have pre-existing conditions such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, High Blood Pressure and Lung Disease. These members of our population are more ‚Äòat risk‚Äô , and a much greater proportion of these individuals will need hospitalization. 

  
Younger members of our population (up to age 50, or perhaps 60) with no pre-existing conditions, have a much lower incidence of needing hospitalization and often have very mild symptoms. These members also comprise of the majority of the workforce of our economy. 

  
Instead of having the economy crash with the current ‚Äòstay at home‚Äô policy, in trying to prevent overwhelm of our hospital systems, why couldn‚Äôt we:   


1. Set up a secure online survey to determining age and prior medical conditions that people fill out to assess higher risk for COVID-19, and determine/ nominate that they will remain isolated. Can also use street teams, as well as analysis of existing government datasets such as senior support, disability services, etc. to quickly develop a comprehensive view of the vulnerable population. 
2. Set up local community food delivery/meal system to those identified in the survey as high risk to ensure they can remain isolated. Establish procedures for non-contact food prep and delivery. Free meals for low income, subsidized for over a certain income level to ensure they can comfortable isolate. ¬†Jobs will be created in our economy to prep these meals/groceries for those at risk, and wellness calls.  
 
3. Open up businesses again (2 weeks‚Äô time), with those at low risk returning to work, and ensuring our economy is preserved. ¬†There will still be hospitalized cases from the low risk, but if the math is done correctly, hospitals will not be overwhelmed.‚ÄòHerd‚Äô Immunity will develop quickly, where the majority of the population has had the virus, and is now immune and not shedding the virus 
4. Then, based on hospital beds available, slowly reintroduce those at higher risk back out of isolation, eg, reopen to 60 to 70 year olds first, etc. At this stage, it will be harder for them to catch COVID-19 as the majority of people in the population will be immune and not contagious.  
 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only person to have thought of something like this. Is it just because we can‚Äôt get organized fast enough?¬†",1,1585281673,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/fpq9ip/why_are_we_making_everyone_self_isolate_from/,explainlikeimfive,1

So, while unable to go out, I've been rewatching Orange is the New Black. I got to the episode where Sophia was denied her HRT, and she started having things like thick hair on her neck show up. She was very worried about ""reverting"" if she was continued to be denied her HRT. However, she had made it clear that she had had bottom surgery, and thus she no longer had any testes, which is what produces testosterone. 

I guess what confused me is, if she no longer can produce testosterone, why was she experiencing these symptoms when she wasnt getting the proper dosage of estrogen? I know the estrogen is used to counteract the testosterone at the beginning, and it helps to keep the features trans women want, but if there's no new testosterone being produced in the body, why was she experiencing the changes? 

I'm not too knowledgable about hormones, and while I know her not having her meds was bad, I just dont understand the science behind it. So if someone could help, that would be greatly appreciated!

So far I knew that they were hydrocarbons since they are composed of hydrogen and carbon. Later I tohught that there are some compounds that have C-H bonds, but might not be hydrocarbons. So I tried finding which properties allows a compound to be called a hydrocarbon. And I found out that it should be strictly composed of Hydrogen and Carbon, contrary to what I knew for the past year. But that would mean Aldehydes and those other stuffs aren't hydrocarbons. However, we were taught at school that they are hydrocarbons. Or atleast in a way that they are a part of it. Alkanes, Alkenes, Alkynes, Aldehydes, Alcohols, Carboxylic Acids have been taught together without being pointed out that they aren't the same category.

foy9jb,drunksouls69,ELI5: Why do some minor superficial abrasions get infected by tetanus?,"Theoretically, since C Tetani is anaerobic, it should not be able to germinate in minor wounds, such as an abrasion, or shallow scratch.

But I'm reading that sometimes it does. Usually in older people, or people with diabetes. But it does happen to young people after minor abrasions for seemingly no reason that I can ascertain.

Superficial abrasions should be well oxygenated and thus prevent tetanus from manifesting after such a wound.

I also read that some conditions in the wound must be present for germination. Such as:

Deep, low oxygen environment.

Dead tissue.

Coinfection with another bacteria.

Foreign body contamination, such as dirt.

Localized ischemia (low blood supply).

This source says atleast two of these factors must be present along with no immunity from tetanus for it to cause tetanus.

So, I'm wondering, do all of these supposed ""minor abrasions"" described actually end up getting infected, or containing dead tissue? I'm not sure. A completely healthy abrasion shouldn't be able to cause tetanus if none of these factors are present.",2,1585170402,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/foy9jb/eli5_why_do_some_minor_superficial_abrasions_get/,explainlikeimfive,1

foxy9n,TumblingDice82,ELI5: will new washing machine fit in this space?,"Ok Reddit, please help me out. I'm terrible at spacial visualizing and am looking for help to make sure I have enough space in my laundry room for new washer and dryer. The existing setup is a stacked ""unitized"" washer/dryer combo that is 24 inches wide. The available space is located between a wall and counter that is 28.5 inches wide. However, in order to place the equipment against the side wall, it will need to first get past the door frame that extrudes out. The measurement between the edge of the door frame and the countertop is exactly 27 inches. Please see the photos for visual explanation.

[photos](https://imgur.com/a/cuiMdCd)

Most standard size single unit washers and dryers are 27 inches wide. Ideally, I would like to purchase a new stackable 27 inch wide washer and dryer, rather than be forced to purchase another one of these slightly compact stacked ""unitized"" combos. Do you think there's enough space to get such machines into the nook given the width limitations I'm working with? 

To be clear, there should be enough depth space so that the machines can sit ""behind"" the edge of the door frame. The machines are currently pulled out from the back wall in the photos.  My question is: will I be able to easily squeeze the machines past the edge of the door frame? Once it gets past there, it should be plenty of room (1.5 inches extra width).

I realize this may be an obvious question, but forgive me. Again, I'm a total idiot with no ability to confidently assess these types of things.

I understand the pathogens are present in the fecal waste of infected persons and when they reach a healthy person through food or water can infect them. However, how does an outbreak of E. coli poisoning, cholera, or similar diseases get going? Are these pathogens normally present in the guts of healthy, asymptomatic individuals, or do they live somewhere else (in animals, perhaps) until they reach the human food-chain? Is it possible for a healthy individual to harbour dangerous pathogens in their gut that do not cause the disease, but somehow when the same pathogen reaches their upper GI tract they get the disease? 

Just confused about how these pathogens circulate. Naively it seems to me that either they're already in people's guts to start with, in which case why is the disease not already present in the population, or  if these people are healthy, how come the contamination of food or water with fecal matter starts the infection when apparently the people are already living healthily with the pathogens??

foiysv,hairyfrankfurt,ELI5: Meditation," I'm currently doing unguided meditation for 30mins twice a day, just trying to focus on my breath, and have been relatively consistent (maybe missing my evening session but never both) for almost 2 months now.

I suffer with pretty bad depression and anxiety, had a ""traumatic"" childhood, and am in recovery for an eating disorder (not bragging, just explaining the reasons I'm trying to do this and why it may be harder for me).

Guided meditations are an AWFUL experience for me. I get distracted by what they're saying, analyse their instruction, respond with all the reasons I can't do what they're saying and then get upset, angry and frustrated, normally ending in a tantrum (hence you should explain like I'm 5, sometimes I act like it).

When I'm ""meditating"" I can't seem to pay attention to my breath for very long, find myself thinking and distracted etc. People keep saying ""watch your thoughts"" and I have no idea how to do that, I feel like I *am* my thoughts, they're just my constant experience and I'm swept away in them a lot.

So my question comes down to: what am I supposed to do? How is it supposed to feel? When do I know when I'm doing it right? How do I get better at it? What does it feel like when it's working? How long does it take to work?

You may be surprised to learn  that some colored items actually can be safely laundered with regular Bleach. It all depends on the type of dye used, and how it was applied.*"" that just confused me more...I find out whether it's color-fast by checking if it's discolored by a properly diluted amount? That seems...too late to save my shirt.

Similarly ""The bleach active in Clorox2 is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). At the concentration used in the laundry,  hydrogen peroxide is a much less aggressive bleach than sodium hypochlorite. "" sound good, but I never hear anyone talk about just using those brown bottles of hydrogen peroxide with laundry...

And Borax gives even more complicated/contradictory answers about whether or not it ""bleaches"" colored clothes, etc...

Everything online thus seems to just say ""I dunno, try it - maybe it'll work, maybe it won't, maybe it'll disinfect but maybe not, too many variablese to list"".

Some questions I have about each relation:

What economic and social policies does Russia have now (i.e., did she adopt a Western-style market economy)? What is the relationship between Putin and Trump? Why would Russians hack the 2016 election?
* What is the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia? If the US is so committed to spreading ""democratic"" and ""universal"" values around the globe and puts sanctions on countries who commit ""human rights violations,"" why does it make an exception for Saudi Arabia?
* What was the war in Syria about? Who won in the end?
* And just one more question regarding the Middle East in general.

Right now about 15 to 20 thousand deaths have been reported on it. While WHO estimates around 200,000 to 700,000 die annually from normal seasonal flu.

The ones that report higher death rate divide deaths by known cases which is obviously off the mark as so many more don't go to get it checked (while everyone who had died gets diagnosed for cause of death). The symptoms are definitely not worse than normal flu, although a dry cough and fever seems to be present in most of them, which again, isn't worse, just a pattern. And finally, here in the UK at least, in most confirmed deaths I've read so far, there was always an underlying poor health condition when they died. 

So, again, I just want to take it more seriously but need convincing or better understanding.",1,1585048992,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/fo3iro/why_is_covid_19_worse_than_seasonal_flu/,explainlikeimfive,1

fni7z1,paulitician27,ELI5: Why does my PC slow down as it is used for longer periods of time without shutting down?,"I've noticed that when I turn my computer to do something quick (print a few pages, online banking, etc) that the time it takes to perform most of the processes and operations is much faster as opposed to when I have been using the computer for a longer period (6+ hours) and am trying to do the same things. I was curious as to why this happens. Sometimes, if I forget to turn my computer off and it stays on overnight, it can take *several seconds* to minimize or open a new Chrome window or a folder on the desktop to view the files when normally these operations would happen almost immediately on click. However, if I restart the computer, everything is much faster again.

I'm a CS student, and I would guess it has to do with filling the caches in RAM as the computer is used for longer periods. Assuming the RAM is fairly empty/clean on startup compared to several hours after, when you have used the computer shortly after startup, the RAM can fetch recent instructions and perform recent operations easily since the caches can be searched and queried quicker because they are not filled with much data. However, when you've been using the computer for several hours, you've performed many more operations than you have shortly after startup, so the caches are much more occupied with data and thus cannot be queried as quickly. Also, to cache new data, it takes longer because after long periods, the memory slot where the data goes must be cleared before the data is stored, which is an extra operation.

I took a computer architecture class last semester, and this was what came to mind, but please feel free to correct me or explain in more detail. Thoughts?",0,1584961847,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/fni7z1/eli5_why_does_my_pc_slow_down_as_it_is_used_for/,explainlikeimfive,1

fni536,jolshefsky,ELI5: How come videos like from smaller sites or embedded are substantially louder than those from YouTube or Vimeo?,"On (nearly) every video not on YouTube or Vimeo, I have to keep the volume slider at its player's lowest notch to match YouTube on the 3/4 to full position. So it's like with those sites, the volume control needs to be at 1 (of 10) while YT needs 8 for the same volume.

To go older-than-5 for a moment, I'm pretty sure that analog audio has an established 0dB level that allows for 4-6 dB minimum headroom‚Äîin other words, recordings are set to have a level of 10 on the volume control, but there's actually enough room to go to 11 or 12 for loud bursts without distorting (or more if the equipment allows, but not all equipment does, so nobody would record normal stuff in that way). On digital, it's all bits, and I figure most stuff is still 16 bits which allows a range of about 110dB, so you'd record up to a maximum of 15 bits to leave that 4-6 dB overhead.

Thus, on ""old"" recordings (records, tape, CD), the ""normal"" listening level might have been 5 but an overly loud recording might have only required that you turn down to 4, not from 8 to 1. The common problem was quiet recordings that needed you to turn up to 8 or 9.

In a way, it makes senses that farmed, food animals have more specific, sexed terms, because farmers need to actively plan (or sometimes prevent) breeding.  

But, the question of what is especially important about male cats, but female dogs (and unimportant about female cats/male dogs) has me baffled.

And does this quirk apply to other languages, or is it unique to English?

(according to Google, apparently there IS technically a term for female cats; ""queens"". But no-one knows/uses it, while most 8yos know what a ""tom"" is, so it doesn't really count.

fndjmb,unemotionals,ELI5 about why I (and average citizens) should care about cyber security,"So before I get flamed for this one as I know it‚Äôs a touchy topic on Reddit, let me explain.

So, as a Canadian, I‚Äôve heard that our neighbours down south are abusing the fact that the everyone is focussed on Coronavirus right now to pass a controversial bill, granting the US govt access to every single phone call or message passed/sent/received on American soil, WITHOUT warrant or court order... 

Now I understand the obvious need for end to end encryption (I‚Äôm studying comp sci in school), and I guess recording *every* phone call or message is kinda overkill, but I feel like I still have the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have anything to hide, you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid‚Äù attitude about it. 

Like what, would they really care about my texts to my friends which mention what page of the homework I have to do is on? Or texts from my mom telling me to pick some groceries up on the way home? There isn‚Äôt really anything perverse about that, in my opinion. 

I guess it depends if they start hitting us with targeted ads (which they already are), and the extent to which this info will be used? Cuz like major corporations like Google &amp; Facebook already have all our data. Cuz we gave it to them. Sometimes willingly and sometimes unwillingly, for the trade-off of convenience. But I guess I still don‚Äôt see the major issue? 

TL;DR: Cybersecurity as a whole is becoming a big issue in North America &amp; other developed nations, there seems to be much outrage against it, but I guess I‚Äôm just having trouble understanding why as the average person ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have anything to hide‚Äù...",1,1584935930,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/fndjmb/eli5_about_why_i_and_average_citizens_should_care/,explainlikeimfive,1

So my understanding of how breathing works is that when we inhale, our lungs inflate and merge the oxygen with the blood, which our heart distributes through our veins to all the cells in our body.

So my conclusion is that when our lungs inflate they should deflate on their own, even when we hold our breath since the air escapes into our blood.
