I was just wondering if somebody could give my plan a once over and point out if I've missed anything?So I'm planning to stream PS4/Nintendo Switch games but am a bit shaky on the actual hardware I need. Currently I'm looking at getting:

* A helicon goxlr,
* An elgato game capture 4k60 pro mk.2,
* An elgato camlink,

and then using my A6000 for a facecam (via the camlink).   
I haven't been able to find if the Camlink can be used alongside the 4k60 pro or not? (I'm really hoping I don't need to get a second capture card!)  


I already have a top notch PC and a condenser mic, but is there anything major I'm missing here?   
Does anyone have any advice on the complexity of streaming PS4 pro footage to twitch?

fsk381,QWERTY36,"I see lots of people extending their streaming schedule right now, here are some tips I learned full time streaming to make it easier!","Hey guys. With this growing shelter in place situation, I'm noticing tons of small and medium sized streamers streaming for WAY longer and WAY more often than normal. I just thought I would share some tips I learned over the last year that helped me when I sank into a full time streaming schedule.

#**Background**
____

Back in April, I wanted to see how far I could get by full time streaming. I went from 20 followers to over 250 followers in a couple months when I was living in Japan, and livestreaming VR games full time. My situation changed and for about 9 months I was unable to find the time to pick up streaming again. But now that I am about to jump into a very similar schedule again. I thought I would share with you the things that I learned along the way, that helped me to stay sane and healthy during that time.

#**Staying Healthy**
___

If you are going to stream for 8 hours. You are going to either REALLY want a break at some point, or forget that time has passed. Either way, you are going to want to set yourself up for this ahead of time. I would ALWAYS have 2 bottles of water under my desk / off camera **BEFORE** the stream started, which helped out. As well as figured out my meals ahead of time. I would usually take a 30 min break, and either play clips / highlights of my friend's streams and my own while eating. and sometimes I would even just throw it over to my chatting scene and eat and talk to the audience.

I also kept it relevant by eating bananas during sea of thieves, apples during minecraft etc, just to have an excuse to eat on camera, and turn something boring into something the audience could enjoy. 

Incorporate exercises into your game-play, pushup challenges, bets with viewers, some sort of motion outside of your chair is NECESSARY during this time. *(VR streamers, you are exempt, just play beat saber once a week)*

#**STAYING POSITIVE**
___


When streaming one of the best pieces of advice I ever received was to turn off the viewer count. It doesn't matter how many viewers you have. When you are streaming the content is about YOU. That shouldn't change if you have 5 viewers or 40. Just turn off the numbers, have fun, and check them after. The other important thing is to advertise on other platforms, i.e. your discord or twitter or Instagram, about the things you will be doing on stream. Make an event that week, make a stream goal, invite friends, multi stream. If you make things for your viewers to look forward to, you WILL draw an audience. And keeping that mindset ahead of time will make sure that you don't go crazy when streaming to 0 people (it will happen), since you know that you have a timeline to work on.


#**STAYING SANE**
___

Switch it up! Unless you literally *ONLY* play fortnite, cod, overwatch, etc. Then you should try to expand to different games, perhaps less saturated games. You could even turn this into an event for the point I made in *Staying Positive*, new game on Friday, viewer polls and audience recommendations etc. Everyone has a steam backlog (don't lie) and this can not only keep you busy, and your audience interested. But it can help to lower that number from the 100s of games you probably haven't played yet to something closer to 0.

Even if you are a 1-trick streamer, play different gamemodes. Fortnite creative with subs, cod and overwatch custom games, etc. There is plenty of variety to be had within those games. And I promise you, you will lose interest if you do nothing but BR for 1 month, 8 hours a day.

#**KEEPING YOUR AUDIENCE INTERESTED**
___

If you follow the points I outlined above, you should have no problem keeping things interesting and changing it up. I do know that there are hundreds of channels out there dedicated to twitch tips, and audience retention that are far more detailed than info I can give. But if you follow the guidelines to not only keep yourself healthy, positive, and sane, your followers will appreciate it, and you will keep your viewer count growing.

#Hope this helps some of you out there! Stay safe, and stay healthy!

I've been having problems streaming on Twitch for a few days now: I have 20 mbs upload and I've been streaming for 2 months straight with 6 000 bitrate with 0% dropped frames, but since last week I can't stream with 6k bitrate because I get 30% or more dropped frames.

My connexion hasn't changed a bit so I tried streaming on mixer just to see if it's my connexion or Twitch and on Mixer I can stream with 10k bitrate with 0% dropped frames, then again when I go back on twitch I get alot of dropped frames. I tried the Twitch Bandwidth Test app and saw that the servers where I got 10 000 kbps+ before (Italy and France) now only show 4 000 kbps at best.

Can anyone help me? I also contacted my ISP and there's no throttling on their behalf so I'm kinda lost and I only wanna stream on Twitch. Thanks guys.",1,1585681250,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fsixdu/getting_low_bandwidth_and_dropped_frames_on/,Twitch,1

fsi2j1,Shiffting,Fps drops when capturing game with obs (or any other streming app)," 

Hi, brace yourselves because this is interesting.

I have a decent pc (to be modest) with an rtx 2060 super and an i5-9600k. I also have a 600mbs internet connection.

My problem is with streaming in any app wether it is twitch studio, obs or streamlabs obs. whenever i enter any game (besides league of legends lmao), and go into a game, for example overwatch , call of duty, rainbow six siegue... the streaming fps has HUGE drops.

Now i've tried everything, ive changed encoders settings, ive lowered my resolution, i've lowered my framerate, nothing seems to be working. im streaming at 6k bitrates, and ive also tried the obs auto-detect settings, nothing works. Funny fact, i have 2 monitors, if i see the stream while in game (im in the screen of the game) it doesnt work. But if i alt + tab out into whatever other app(for ex obs) i can see how the game is been captured by obs extremelly smooth, with 0 fps drops.

Again, specswise, my cpu barely gets to 10% usage even when gaming and streaming at the same time, and my gpu stands at 99%(which is supossed to be cool), so its not a cpu problem.

To give you as much info as i can, this also happenned on csgo but somewhy, disableing multicore rendering solved the problem, unfortunately other games dont have that option, but again my cpu is barely being used so idk.

Sorry if im repetitive in this post, im just trying to explain my problem, ask whatever you need to know, ill try to answer at the best of my abilities. Thanks in advance :)",0,1585678592,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fsi2j1/fps_drops_when_capturing_game_with_obs_or_any/,Twitch,1

fshm61,BewareOfThePENGuin,Is OBS more stable than SLOBS/Twitch Studio?,"Hello there!  


I've been using SLOBS since around one year and I have HUGE frame drops (60-97%) every now and then, although my internet is stable and shows 15mbps upload speed. Strangely I can ""fix"" the issue by restarting Slobs or logout/login from my Twitch account most of the time. This happens around 2-3x a week and that's quite annoying.  


That's why I'm considering to move to OBS or Twitch Studio. Do you have any experience if it's more stable? Are there these weird frame issues as well? Can I somehow export all my settings from SLOBS to OBS or do I have to set up everything from scratch again? :(

I was just wondering if anybody has any tips on how I can maximise my streaming capabilities (tips from people who stream from their PS4 would be advantageous but not essential).

Him and his mods have also described me as a 'nonce' (paedophile) on several occasions, both in his stream and in other places on the Internet.

fseslo,Smeebit,Hidden scroll bar,"So one day I load twitch like any other day and click on a stream.  By habit, I want to scroll down to read their rules and profile.  But for whatever reason, the scrollbar is missing.  Normally, it's just right of the steam's window.  But this time, it's simply gone.

So in order to scroll down, I click and drag my mouse down.  That works. And also, I notice the scrollbar IS there afterall.  Peeking out from behind the stream window.  Still oriented to the right, only now it's been completely covered.

Unsure of what causes this, I did some experimentation. Disabled *all* of my extensions reloaded the browser(Chrome), set scaling back to default.  But still, the scroll bar remains hidden behind the stream window.

No one else seems to be talking about this, so I can only assume it's unique to my system.  But then again, I don't know what suddenly caused this to occur, or what I can do to solve it.

I was searching on what to then people told me to stream from pc but i didnt wanted cause its kinda worse.(i have problems with mic idk why but it sounds low and dont have webcam for pc). But i decided to do it for my homies. so i streamed from pc and had to remote play the game to put it on obs. that was hard. I had problems with my mic so then i thought to use the ps gold headset which worked liked charm but didnt had battery. I couldnt charge cause i only had one usb and you have to use 1 usb for controller to work with remoteplay. So i was like damn maybe i shouldnt stream and i asked to people. Then i remembered my family has usb as well so ran like a crazy beast to my moms room and got usb and headed back as fasat as possible and charged my wireless headset. Then i had problem of sound which they couldnt hear me loudly but i fixed it by raising my audio to max from obs\`. Then i didnt had webcam as 90 percent people from my stream come for me so i had to speak like crazy. Everyone was there i was avgeraging 20 viewers and had blast and chat was exploding as well. Then at end of the stream one valuable member of my twitch told me that my recovery from bad stream was epic and he had fun. i love all of my boois no homo. i dont even know why i am saying this but dont give up streaming XD and i just wanted to share my story and thanks to all for reading and being there.,1,1585667286,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fsej93/my_recovery_from_shitty_stream_to_awesome_stream/,Twitch,0

fse1kp,Avatic,Twitch saved my life. (Anxiety),"Let me first start off by saying this post will share my real life experience dealing with Anxiety.

So it’s August 26th and my friends and I are extremely excited for Classic World of Warcraft. The game release and we’re all leveling having a great time. September 2nd comes and I feel a pain in my stomach and my wrist at the same time that only last a few seconds. Something triggers in my brain telling me something is wrong and boom, I experience a tingling feeling in my head with instant blurry vision and a lightheaded feeling for about 6 seconds and it gose away!!! Instantly jump up to go to my girlfriend saying I think there is something wrong with me! Boom it happens again! I go to sit on my couch in full panic and boom a third time. Twenty minutes go by and everything seems to be clearing up and then I start to rethink what just happened??? All of a sudden I feel scared and worried feeling, Bam.... a fourth episode. Not knowing what I was going through I went to urgent care to be checked on. They run all the test and my blood work comes back with white blood cell count of 22,000!!! I’m then emitted to hospital for more testing and a cat scan. Now I’m in the mindset my life is over and that it all ends here at age 27. I’m asked all these question of if I feel pain in which I don’t have pain anywhere other than when I had pain in my stomach and wrist for a few seconds before my attack.

The cat scan comes back with all the other test and they find nothing and state I’m in healthy condition and all my numbers were great. I continue my weeks at work but always dreading the thought of getting what I felt September 2nd all over again. As the weeks go by I receive these feelings and attacks multiple times a day and they drag me only digging a deeper hole. The hole becomes so deep that my co workers are worried for me and I explain them everthing I have been going through with these attacks. 

They reached out to get me help through their employee assistant program where I was introduced to David a psychologist who I would talk to each week and let me tell you this man figured me out in just a few visits and if you put my my anxiety on a scale it would be a rollercoaster. Just as I was getting better I would fall twice as far. In just under three months my anxiety got so bad I was asked if I would be interested in taking a leave of absence with fmla. So I thought about it for two weeks and decided it may be best if I did. Right around this time I’m about 12 weeks into suffering from anxiety where David has diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. In this diagnosis he explained to me that maybe I had suffered long enough and was I interested in giving medication a shot. At this point I thought my life was over anyways so why not. He then reached out to a psychiatrist to talk to and let’s say I explained this whole story to her. I was then put on Zoloft and started on the lowest dose and I will day this was making my life a living hell! My anxiety was much worse than it had ever been and I had become depressed and started experiencing derealization. I had muscle twitches every 5 mins in random parts of my body 24/7 and I still have these today over 4 months later but instead of every 5 minutes it’s every few hours I’ll get one. The Zoloft left me dizzy all day where all I wanted to do is watch the office on Netflix in bed. I did this for 10 days and would call my doctor and let her know I’m steal having all these feelings! She switched me to another medication called clomipramine and now it’s late November and I’m starting a new medication. Well let me just say this one slowly started to give me confidence that I was in fact still alive in this world. At about week 5 right after Xmas I started to feel motivated in ways I never felt before. On January first I said I Was going to stream and go all out for it. So I did just that. What I quickly found out is that twitch has an amazing support system. All my viewers would hear me explain my anxiety and they listened to me. What I soon found out is my viewers experienced some of the things I did with anxiety and this helped me so much. Streaming has become a daily routine for me at this point with 3 hours a day that I can chat with and cope with a problem many of us all face. 

So what I really want everyone to get from this is that if you are dealing with anxiety or panic disorder I know exactly what your going through with all the ups and downs. I went from 310 down to 250 from not being able to eat while being so crippled from anxiety. Streaming helped me realize that I am in fact still alive and that I have a community that supports my streams each night and they are there to hear my voice. 

In this streaming process I would get messages from viewers about how I reached out for help. There are many times I have helped my viewers go in the right direction to get the help they need as well. This made me very happy that being open about my anxiety was able to get other people the help they needed! 

I’m thankful twitch has a platform that I can call home and has given me a purpose once again.

If you made it this far I’d like to thank you guys for reading my story.",1,1585665552,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fse1kp/twitch_saved_my_life_anxiety/,Twitch,1

With coronavirus quarantine destroying the music industry and absolutely killing musician bookings I had all my shows cancelled for the next while and decided to explore performing regularly on twitch.

I even got 4 followers wooohoo!! I had a blast and will now do sessions where I bump tunes or work in Ableton live 10 on my tracks.

fsan0t,NatteGans,"This one viewer on my stream is draining my energy, and I don’t know what to do.","I’m a small streamer and I've been streaming for the last couple of weeks now since this whole corona thing started. Liked it ever since, and love to interact with new viewers in the chat.

One of my first followers was this kid, I could instantly tell that he was a kid because we played CSGO together and he sounded really young.
Honestly, I think he's a nice dude, he helped me set up my discord server, he is the one loyal viewer that I have. Every single stream this guy will pop up.

I decided to give him mod because I experienced some trolls in the chat and he is always there to help me but, eventually, he was starting to become really annoying. For example when my parents asked me to help with something and he heard them he would say things like ”Your Mom’s a HOEEEE” 

I had enough because he was clearly disrespecting me and I already thought he was annoying as hell, so I removed his mod. Next stream when he popped up he was sad and I told him that it's nothing personal that I removed it, he's clearly a kid and I don't want to hurt his feelings.

Yesterday, I gave a good friend of mine who pops up in the stream every day, moderator because I trust this dude, the kid saw this and immediately he began asking childish questions like; ”Do you secretly hate me?” ”I’m annoying, everybody hates me.”
He is super childish and wants attention and honestly, it just gets me in a bad mood. I just let it be and he didn't pop up in the stream for a couple of hours because I ignored him.

Suddenly, around a certain time, I began to get a lot of followers, it was super random because I never get that much followers in a day, let's say an hour. 

I was interacting with them in chat and they all seemed really nice, I was super grateful and felt a sense of accomplishment. One guy even told me he lurked for a while and thought I was really funny and would love to drop by later. 
Eventually, I asked one of them where he was from, and he was from the same place as this kid that is in my chat every day. He showed a little bit of the same childish humour as well. 

After stream when I lay in bed I started thinking and suddenly I came to the realization that those accounts are probably fake. They all came at the exact same time, they used the same kind of humour as this kid that's always in my chat. So I decided to search up the accounts to see when they were created, and yup, they were all created yesterday.

I’m kind of annoyed right now because I thought I was speaking with multiple people for hours and eventually it's just this kid giving me fake followers and wanting attention, it literally drains all my energy.
I know he probably means it is a good way but I'm just super annoyed by all of this.

Reddit, could you give me any advice on how to act on him? I know the moment that I'm streaming today he will pop up again and I want to say that he is annoying as hell and needs to stop. I just don't know how to deal with this situation tbh.

English isn't my native tongue btw, so excuse me for that.",8,1585650882,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fsan0t/this_one_viewer_on_my_stream_is_draining_my/,Twitch,1

1. Should I downscale my output resolution to 900p or stick with 1080p?
2. What encoder settings should I use? and follow up by all the other settings such as keyframe interval, preset, profile, cpu usage and tune.

fs772o,Corkumk16,Audio issues on my PS4 stream through OBS,"
Hey everyone! I just started streaming a few days ago and have realized that occasionally, my game audio becomes out of sync when I’m streaming to twitch. It’s always on point in OBS but gunshots and other sounds are off on twitch. I’m streaming from a MacBook Pro 2012 retina. It should have enough power to put out the 720p that I’m exporting. My webcam and mic are set up and working perfectly. I’m using an Elgato HD60s. I’m wondering if it’s an internet issue or an issue with a setting that I’m overlooking. I lowered my bit rate to 3500 and my audio bitrate as well.",4,1585632714,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fs772o/audio_issues_on_my_ps4_stream_through_obs/,Twitch,1

So after a long time not streaming I've decided to really give it a good try and get back in it. I never really got far with streaming and I didn't really know a lot about the technical stuff. Now I can kinda say I do. However I still have a question or two.  
My plan for now is to stream at 720p60 since almost everyone says it's better for non-partnered streamers to stream that way. Now my plan is to stream Souls type games cause I really wanna play them and streaming might give me more motivation to complete them then if I was playing alone.   
The question here is is 60fps recomended for Souls type games, I'm talking about the Dark Souls Trilogy, Nioh 1 and 2, Sekiro, Bloodborne and some others.   
Also not that I really care but how popular are those game on Twitch. I don't really care for viewers but I would like to have a viewer or two to hang and chill with while I play.",4,1585629312,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fs6grb/talking_about_content/,Twitch,1

So after a bit of rewording, I made this command!

32GB RAM

Nvidia RTX 2070 Super

1TB M1 SSD + 2TB HDD

Also I am running wired ethernet for internet and gigabit fiber. Generally when running a speedtest I get 700-800mbps down and 500-700mbps up.

Encoder: Software (x264)

CBR

Output Resolution: 1920x1080

Anyone know of a stream deck-type device, or even an app, that can simultaneously issue commands to both?  So that, for example, hitting a button for the BRB scene would unpause music on one PC and switch scenes on the other.

So streaming is what I do full time now, and has been going pretty well. But I feel I’ve hit a wall on growth due to not being able to find a game where I can dive into it and become really good. Another reason being, I feel like the people I play with sometimes degrade the content im trying to produce by not being mindful that I’m streaming, going off topic, raging way to hard, and just not being at the skill level I’m at. I’m not trying to put any blame on them. I know it isn’t their job, and don’t play for like 8 hours a day like me. But I’m really wanting to find other streamers or content creators that take streaming seriously, and have the time and skill to sink a lot of hours into a game to get good at. I enjoy playing cod, apex, tarkov, bfv r6s, war thunder, and similar titles. I’m on est time too.

fs0oq8,MurkyBlu,Solution for streaming on an Ultrawide,"For many people using ultrawide monitors, streaming is not really practical as most viewers use a 16:9 display to watch. This would lead to black bars on the top and bottom of the video, which was not optimal for many. 

I recently did some testing and found a solution that would work for some. 

Steps

1. Change the in-game aspect ratio to 16:9, 4:3, 16:10, etc. 
2. Set stream output res to 1920x1080 
3. Warp input video (game capture or screen capture) to fill the screen
4. Done!

Disclaimer:

This solution only works if you are fine with a warped aspect ratio. For many FPS games, it is not uncommon to have things set like this for various advantages, but for others, it may hurt the gameplay experience for you, which is not good.",1,1585607006,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fs0oq8/solution_for_streaming_on_an_ultrawide/,Twitch,1

frynxx,1K_Games,Logitech c920 Low Quality,"So I've got my c920 setup, but quality on it is just bad. And now Logitech has revamped drivers so the camera appears in G Hub and shows some options, but also you can see it in Logitech Capture.  But Capture is not a program that boots with Windows so you have to start it each time?  


Either way, I've gone through and adjusted most settings and no luck. The FPS is extremely low, I see people using these and when they talk it looks like they are talking. For me you can see I'm talking, but you would never line up the movements with the words, not enough frames. The video is pretty pixelated, it looks fine in a small window in the corner of a video or something, but beyond thumbnail size it does not look good.  


I have disabled anything that is auto just to try and take strain on the camera trying to make things happen. I've added a light source to my scene so it wasn't dark, but any of that felt like it did nothing. I've seen plenty of videos where people using this cam look sharp without pixelation and good frame rates. So I'm just seeing what tips are out there. Been through a ton of threads and I just feel like I'm missing something, this is suppose to be a very good camera and it has worse quality that my 2-in-1's built in camera (and that is not a good camera).",5,1585600393,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frynxx/logitech_c920_low_quality/,Twitch,1

fry123,Sqwalker1,Making your own sound,"Hi Friends!

I am a brand new streamer (woo for my first 5 followers)! I am mainly streaming online poker. I have this idea that I'm not sure I can word correctly, but I'll try:

I want to create a sound for if I win a big pot or all in, where its like a cheer. I would like to just press a button (say f3) and then it happens in stream. Same thing for a sad sound if I lose (say f4). All I've seen so far is the viewers having to activate in chat using !command by using bits or something like that. I (don't think) I can collect bits or anything like that yet as I'm not affiliate yet.

Is this possible? And if so how?

Thanks in advanced!

fry0wi,checkreverse,Can someone explain to me how to host a stream event?,"Hello

I'm trying to find out how i could host a webshow with multiple people streaming from their homes. 

I would essentially be the technical director and manage what happens on a stream, but i'd be able to have a seperate ""room"" where i can decide which camera is airing on stream at the time.

It would have hosts who keep their cameras on the whole time and each performer would logon to this seperate room where they can get ready and once they are i can switch the feed to them, and then back.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't figure out how to ever do just one stream from my own computer.

For some context, right now I have a real shit rig- it was mainly built for streaming very low end PC games and console games while I saved for some upgrades.   


Now that i've had some time, I very much want to upgrade. For the longest time, I was looking at moving to a 3600x + 2060 Super combo- but now looking at the 3700x + 2070 Super, I don't know which is better to grab for me.  


Ideally i'd like to stream consistently and smoothly, mainly doing stuff like Overwatch and other lower end games anyways, but with the OPTION there if I wanted to say do something like Cyberpunk at Ultra settings and still get somewhere between 60-120fps while streaming. Really looking for 144+ most games as gonna grab a 144 monitor somewhere down the line as well.  


Some other important things:  


Right now my Mobo sucks ass, its an ASUS Prime B450M-A, I plan on upgrading this as well because of the new parts, BUT it won't be until about 2-3 weeks AFTER the CPU and GPU purchase. Will this be ok in the meantime?  


I currently have 16gb of memory, but will probably end up getting 32gb.  


My PSU is currently at 500W, will I need to upgrade this as well? To how much? This would also be about 2 weeks after the CPU and GPU purchases, will I be alright?

I bought a coolpix b500 a few months ago to do some photos for my wife and I. So far my experience with this device is 1/5 stars. This thing eats batteries.

I was hoping i could turn it into a cool webcam for Streaming, but when i connect it to my capture card it only will access preview mode. I cannot generate a preview for Photos or videos. Does anyone know how to set this up as a camera preview instead of playback?",2,1585584951,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frtq9y/how_to_use_a_nikon_coolpix_b500_as_a_webcam_for/,Twitch,1

frthsr,pigmons_balloon,"Newbie, streaming art, tips for attracting more viewers?","Hi there! Title gives a bit of an intro, my husband and I just set up a twitch to stream artwork creation after using only Facebook for streams for the last few years. 

The art is done with a decent speed and is genuinely fun to watch. He and I have a good banter and are relatively entertaining and try to engage with the viewers. 

We’ve done live performances of painting and illustrations for the better part of a decade so I’m not worried too much about keeping people on the stream once it’s going but I am unsure how to attract new viewers. 

We did our first stream last night as sort of a test run and got 45 viewers. I think that’s pretty good for a first go but I really want to get those numbers up and get our ducks in a line to start monetizing our stream.

frtet7,TheEth1c1st,Technical Issues with Elgato HD60 S Capture - wrong resolution and black bars,"Screencaps of Issue: [https://imgur.com/a/oUXInEO](https://imgur.com/a/oUXInEO)

I've been trying to get into Twitch streaming, but I'm stuck on a minor hurdle with my camera, I'm using a crappy old webcam in the interim but obviously that's not idea.  I'd really appreciate any help as my extensive fiddling and Googling doesn't seem to be doing the trick. 

I've input my Nikon D4 to my Elgato HD60 S via HDMI, my D4's movie settings are at 1080p with 25fps (though I tried 1080p, 30 fps to the same result), however Elgato seems to be defaulting to outputting 480 and various other things that bear no resemblance to what's being input, resulting in black bars when input to Obs.  As you can see in the attached screenshot,  Everything is set to 1080, it seems to come down to the resolution the Elgato is outputting, which as you can see in the attached image is 640x480p60fps.  I've tried ticking and unticking the three options under cropping (Convert Standard Definition to 640 by 480 etc.), but it makes no difference.

My camera also frequently turns off live mode whenever I attempt to adjust settings. I think this may be unrelated and down to needing to buy an AC adapter for the camera, though I'm not sure why simply changing the settings would shut it off live view, it's not like it's idling out or the battery is flat, anyway if this is a familiar issue for anyone else and they can suggest a fix, I'd be appreciative!

Also, in Streamlabs OBS, which of the two options should I be picking; ""Game Capture HD60 S (Video) (#01)"" or ""Elgato Game Capture HD""? Note: Both are having the same issue.

I know it's an older camera now, but the D4 was a lot of camera when I bought it, it's more than capable of outputting 1080p and I'd love to get things working with THAT camera, rather than spending more money unnecessarily.",8,1585583966,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frtet7/technical_issues_with_elgato_hd60_s_capture_wrong/,Twitch,1

My second option is being a twitch game streamer and then making videos on youtube in whatever manner I feel, similar to pewdiepie and other gamers. Anyways, any feedback will help.

frt9q3,10leej,Using IRC for a chat overlay in OBS-Studio,"I heard twitch chat overlays are a thing, but I hate how everyone just uses a window capture. I found this method to produce unreliable results since I don't have a dedicated streaming PC so I came up with a “better” solution. Using ""dead"" technology of course.  
You see. Twitch.tv’s chat system uses an IRC backend and they have this [lovely document](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/guide/) that explains how to connect to it.  
And IRC clients have this thing called a “log” and OBS-Studio has this handy option to read, you guessed it. Text files! 
 
You guys that know a thing or two see where I’m going here? This method works on every OS you can install both OBS-Studio and an IRC client on. Which is pretty much all of them.  

Ok so here’s my setup and how I configured this myself. Bear in Mind if you’ve never used IRC before this is not a guide intended for IRC, look that up yourself.  

##I’m using the following machine:  
[Debian 10.3 “Buster”](https://www.debian.org/)  
[Gnome Desktop](https://www.gnome.org/)  
[Hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/)  
[OBS-Studio](https://obsproject.com/)  

We’ll first start off with getting our IRC client setup first. For this we need what’s called an Oauth token from twitch which you can get from [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) (it’s also linked in the twitch doc I linked above)  

1. Get your Oauth token  
2. Open Hexchat add Twitch to your network list the server address is irc,twtich.tv/6697  
3. Select/check Use SSL for all servers on this network  
4. Set ALL YOUR NAMES to your twitch username  
5. login method “Server password(/PASS password)  
6. password is your Oauth token formatted “oauth:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx”  
7. Make sure you have Hexchat set to auto join #twitchusername  
8. Connect to your chat server via IRC, make sure it’s working (you'll see yourself show up your twitch channel's chat frame)  
9. Next open the Hexchat settings &gt;preferences go straight to “Logging” in the “Chatting “dropdown  
10. Change Log filename to “ %n/%c.txt ” thi is because OBS will only read .txt files not .log files  
12. hit the “Open Data Folder” button to get your chat log location in hexchat under linux it’s typically “/home/USERNAME/.config/hexchat/log/HEXCHATSERVERNAME/#TWITCHUSERNAME.txt” no need to open the file, just get the full filepath.  
13. Open OBS-Studio make a text file source  
14. Select both “Read from file” and “Chat log mode”  
15. Set the Chat log lines to something smaller I use “10” myself  
16. In the Text File (UTF-8 or UTF-16) put your full file path.  
17. Set a Custom text width, this will set a hard width on your text source so it won’t move around and look funny  
18. I advise selecting “Word Wrap” so people can see the full message.  

##And you technically should now have a working chat overlay!  
If for some problem you have Rectangles showing in your your chat just open hexchat’s preferences go to “Interface&gt;Appearance&gt;and deselect “Indent nick names”  
If you want to edit the chat timestamp you have to edit the loggin setup in Hexchat&gt;Preferences&gt;Chatting&gt;Loggin&gt;Log timestamp format, I use “%H:%M”",4,1585583486,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frt9q3/using_irc_for_a_chat_overlay_in_obsstudio/,Twitch,1

I just started my journey as a JRPGs streamer in Twitch (with 2 followers), and I basically just set up a veeeeery basic streaming without facecam since I streamed full screen. So I was wondering, is there a beginner guide for me to start a more better stream?

I wanted to have a facecam because I thought it would be fun to talk and connect to viewers while gaming, but since I haven't thought of getting a webcam for this, so yeah is there any suggestion else that can help me in becoming a better streamer?

frp6oj,Freakstah,Two PC stream settings,"Hi all.

Thinking of getting into streaming a bit so I've been preparing a two stream setup which I managed to get working a couple of days ago.   


Setup is :

Gaming PC :

i7 8700k 6 core 12 thread stock at 4.4 Ghz  
32 Gb RAM G.Skill Ripjaws V 3000 MHz  
GTX 1080 Ti EVGA SC Black Edition 11 Gb  
HDD 2 TB Toshiba + SSD 240 GB Kingston  


Streaming PC :

i5 4690 4 core stock at 3.9 Ghz  
16 Gb RAM HyperX Fury 1866 MHZ DDR3  
Radeon R9 380 Nitro Sapphire 4 Gb   


I'm using NDI to stream since i have no capture card.

My DL/UL are 52/11 mbps. The goal is to stream at 720p60. For OBS settings I'm using X264 encoder with CBR 5500 Kbps on CPU preset veryfast. With this preset my CPU usually goes to about max 88% usage while still keeping the temps in the low 50s (C).

From watching my own stream and a friend helping me out to see from his perspective, the stream usually runs smoothly but I do see that sometimes when I'm moving around that the background gets a bit blurry. Anyone has any idea what I could do to remedy that or is that just a limitation to my streaming hardware ? My other question would be if I set a better preset would it be okay if the CPU goes to 100% all the time since I read somewhere that the sweet spot for CPU is 70% usage?

What I did do was try to increase the CPU preset to faster / fast but that caused my CPU to spike to 100% all the time (more so with fast tho).  Don't know if it's relevant but my ""Profile"" and ""Tune"" settings in OBS are set to ""none"".

Any help / tips would be greatly appreciated. For any other settings I may not have mentioned please feel free to ask.",2,1585568224,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frp6oj/two_pc_stream_settings/,Twitch,1

I love meeting new people and the thing I love able streaming is exactly that, meeting new people and engaging with them. I haven’t been able to grow my channel at all very much since then and I’ve tried every tip out there. A set schedule, playing games that aren’t saturated, niche games, posting on Twitter, Instagram, even TikTok now and I still can’t seem to bring in more than 5 viewers.

I don’t want to give up on my stream but sometimes I really feel like I should and I’m trying to get over that and push through. I also hate when people say “join my stream team!” But then you have to sub to their channel and you get no features, raids or anything else from being a part of it.

I’m from Northern California. First job in 2019, got my first paycheck from Twitch in 2019. Filing for my retail seems easy. Currently using FreeTaxUSA.

I made around $175 from royalties, which I’m assuming are from subs. I don’t know about bits. I got my 1099-MISC from Twitch. Nothing from PayPal. So far just like using my W-2, it seemed easy to plug in the information.

Though I am stuck on the Qualified Business Income part. **Is Twitch Streaming a QBI?** I’ve significantly slowed down on streaming and only do it whenever these days. **Do I need to tally information from PayPal even though I got no tax documents available from them?** **Despite receiving a 1099-MISC do I still need to file my Twitch income since I only made $175 according to the doc they sent me?**

I know I should be talking to a tax professional, but it’s hard to seek one out during this lockdown. My friends/family aren’t familiar with this.

frm5o9,huntsman_original,1/2 Way to Affiliate With Very First Stream - 5 Achievements Unlocked - How I Did It,"Yesterday I brought up the need to network off of Twitch in order to get discovered which can often be difficult because so many forums and other places where you can really connect with other streamers flat out do not allow the inclusion of anything that would actually lead others to your stream. They even go to such extremes as to flag certain words to limit your networking capabilities which makes one wonder what their motivation is for creating subreddits or other forums are exactly. You can't even give yourself proper credit or offer proof of what you've created or accomplished. 

Go to a forum where such things are encouraged and your content gets buried so quickly below others doing the same that no one will ever see it anyway. So exactly what are new streamers suppose to do to stand out in a community that doesn't really like you standing out? Do it anyway. 

My primary base for Twitch is a 10K sub YouTube Channel with an entire network of social media pages built around it. Over-all I have to update 17 different sites based on my brand every week and sometimes every day. Many of my first viewers on Twitch came over from YouTube to support my premiere stream which bumped me up higher on the search results. No one should bother with streaming to zero viewers. No one is ever going to scroll down that low to find your stream amidst all of the others. You should be able to find even 5-10 friends or family members to log onto your stream and bump you up a lot higher out of that muck. 

Doing just that I gained over 20 new followers during my very first livestream on Huntsman\_Alpha because people on the platform could actually find the stream amidst the search results. I gained 7 more followers AFTER the stream ended without even sharing it out anywhere putting me up to over 50 followers with 1 stream.

Facebook is the LAST social media platform to try and network on. The site is overloaded with crap groups that won't get you anywhere and many of them are set to 'private' meaning the viewership is limited to a very small pool of people. 

Twitter on the other hand is HUGE for Twitch Streamers to network and connect on and probably the #1 social media site to get your content out to new audiences. I just updated my Twitter regarding my first stream and the Tweet has been retweeted and seen by over 200 people in the first 5 minutes. 

Turning your channel name into a hashtag is also huge. It allows for the content to pool in SEO fashion across different platforms rising you up through search engine results far faster than by not doing it. If I type Huntsman\_Alpha as a hashtag into Google it brings up my Twitch Channel, YouTube videos, Instagram account, Facebook Pages and groups, Twitter posts and even photo albums across the first 3 pages of google search results. It also allows me to track others who are mentioning my Twitch handle in places I don't visit or post to. 

I created movie teaser style YouTube videos to promote my Twitch Channel and used the community section of my YouTube channels ( I have 2) to also promote the streams. Community sections on YouTube are not limited to your subscribers only. Those post go out publicly all over YouTube reaching an audience beyond you subscriber base right on the YouTube homepage. Many don't utilize that feature very often and those that do use it in the wrong way. 

Reconstituting content saves you a ton of time and energy. I can take a single stream and create 20 different things out of it including teasers, clips, full length videos, screen shots, gifs and more to spread around getting the maximum amount of reach for the minimal amount of content. 

You have to think bigger than just your Twitch channel itself. You have to go all out in full movie level production in all forms of media or you are simply never going to be found amidst all the others. 

If you do not have a YouTube channel and don't want to add that to your creation list don't worry. There's an answer for that too. Set up a channel anyway even though you are only going to create on Twitch. Twitch allows you to export your livestreams over to YouTube instantly with on click.

frlgz1,nutella4eva,Let Your Viewers Control Your Stream With Bits/Subs/Channel Points!,"#[FULL VIDEO GUIDE!](https://youtu.be/CAvoF82qu6o)

#INTRODUCTION

Last year, I made a post on [5 Stream Deck alternatives](https://old.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ciw43p/5_stream_deck_alternatives/). Well a month ago, I discovered yet another Stream Deck alternative called LioranBoard. I literally have not heard anybody talk about it before and it has one feature that is totally unique that I have not seen on any Stream Deck app before, and that is that **it can be triggered using bits, subs, channel points and more!**

This guide will show you how to set up LioranBoard and allow your viewers to control your stream and perform commands like changing scenes, toggling sources, even toggling source filters (which even a real Stream Deck can't do) and much more. For example, you can set up a channel point reward that will allow viewers to switch camera angles, or you activate fun filters to mess with your stream.

***Note: Other than knowing the developer, I am in no way affiliated with the LioranBoard project. This app is just completely unheard of and I wanted to share it with all of you***



#WHAT YOU'LL NEED

* [LioranBoard Desktop App](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/android-pc-stream-deck-manager.862/)

You'll need this to setup the commands and their triggers. ***This only works with OBS Studio. Streamlabs OBS is incompatible with LioranBoard. You have been warned!***

* [OBS WebSocket Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-of-obs-studio-made-easy.466/)

LioranBoard needs this to communicate with OBS (so that it can take control of it)

* Android Phone (optional)

Only needed if you want an interface to manually trigger commands at the push of a button. **For the purpose of this guide, we won't cover the Android app, since we're only concerned with the viewer interaction component, which doesn't require the app at all.**



#INITIAL SETUP

1. Download and install the OBS Websocket plugin per the instructions in the provided download link.
2. Download LioranBoard and unzip it to your preferred location.
3. Inside, you'll see three folders. A *Receiver* + 2 *Stream Deck* apps (one for Android and one for Windows). We will only be dealing with the *Receiver* for this guide.
4. Open up the *LioranBoard Receiver.exe* app.

#SETTING UP THE RECEIVER

1. In the [initial setup window](https://i.imgur.com/kBfaOEk.png), you'll need to enter your OBSWebsocket Port number. If you don't know what this is, chances are you can just leave it at default. You can also check *Auto Connect to OBSws* and *Auto Connect to Twitch* (more on that soon)
2. Click the three buttons labelled [here](https://i.imgur.com/nvFXAFG.png). These are all necessary to connect LioranBoard to OBS as well as to allow LioranBoard to listen to sub/host/channel point events.
3. After clicking the third button, you should see an error popup telling you that *TLS transmitter must be running*. To fix this, add a browser source, and point the browser source at the *tsl_transmitter.html* (included in the zip file you downloaded earlier). You don't actually need this browser source displayed anywhere, so you can just hide it and store it away in an empty OBS scene that you aren't using. It just needs to be open.
4. At this point, all three buttons you click should be [grayed out](https://i.imgur.com/IEZRfGL.png). If this is the case, everything connected successfully and you can move on to the next step.

#CREATING COMMANDS

1. Click [*Add New Deck*](https://i.imgur.com/tdoB7AX.png) and select your newly created deck.
2. In your new deck, you'll see a grid. If you click on any of the cells, you can click [*Create New Button*](https://i.imgur.com/Z1GLV8a.png).
3. Right click on your new button and select [*Add Commands*](https://i.imgur.com/5JiFRAy.png)
4. On this page, you can set OBS commands (e.g. switch scenes, toggle sources, toggle filters). You can string together multiple commands including adding delays. When you're happy, click *Done*.
5. Right click on your new button again and select [*Add Twitch Triggers*](https://i.imgur.com/gSOJNBP.png)
6. On this page, you can set triggers. As the name suggests, these will trigger the command you previously just set up. The triggers can be bits, subs, hosts, raids, chat messages and even point redeems (i.e. channel points). If you are setting up a channel point trigger, make sure the name of the [trigger](https://i.imgur.com/uLtilIF.png) is *exactly* the same as the name of the reward in your [Twitch dashboard](https://i.imgur.com/ECHeWq8.png). LioranBoard matches the names of the rewards with the names of the triggers.

#CONCLUSION

That's it. Just click *Done* to save your changes, then you can start testing your new commands. Just make sure LioranBoard is open and connected, otherwise it won't work. If you have any questions, make sure to give the developer your feedback.",1,1585548605,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frlgz1/let_your_viewers_control_your_stream_with/,Twitch,1

I'm SoggyWrongdoer5 (A name Reddit picked for me). I've always wanted to stream on Twitch, but here is my dilemma:

**I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT I WANT TO STREAM!**

I've been thinking about this for literal years. Some people have told me, ""Just stream what you like to play"". Well, that's an issue because I like playing a bit of everything. As a college student with a lot of free time suddenly because of the COVID-19 crisis, I figured I might as well start. So, since I can't make up my mind, I decided to ask Reddit. What would you like to see played? Obviously there are a ton of streamers out there for the big games such as COD and LoL. Is there something else that people want to watch? Also, because of my indecisiveness, I will be letting Reddit pick my name and branding type of thing. Really, all this is is a big ""design your own Twitch channel"" post. **Please give me some ideas on names to go by and stuff to play!** 

Thank you for the time reading this and hopefully there are some great replies!",5,1585541048,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frjwlk/reddits_choice/,Twitch,1

720p source-only can be a problem too, if there's anything else using any kind of bandwidth at all. So I often end up clicking right out of those too.

If there's any way at all to know if a stream has transcoding available *before* going into the stream itself, or hide streams which don't have transcoding then that would seriously be a big help.",5,1585540344,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frjqt5/is_any_way_to_hide_1080p_sourceonly_streams_or/,Twitch,1

I mean I still don’t, but it’s the pure milestone that gets me so excited. When I hit that 50th follower on Saturday night and saw the email inviting me to be an affiliate when I finished there was just this rush of pride, and 24 hours later I’m still riding it and just wanted to share it with the world. 

So to anyone out there who feels the struggle and the grind: I’ve been there, we’ve all been there. It took me a bit longer to get there than most, but If you enjoy doing it it doesn’t matter. I know I love gaming, I may not be the best at it and I may look like an absolute idiot doing it, but I love it and I love sharing my love of it with people.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't need anything crazy, but I don't just want enough to ""get by"", since I know I'll probably want to play more and more games. I don't do fps as of right now...I may want to do them offline since I don't mind being terrible with nobody watching.  I do mostly RPG, the only shooter type games I do are 3rd person. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that being said, I see a lot of pre-made and used setups that I've been looking at to bypass the process of purchasing everything.  Soooo

&amp;#x200B;

1) Is this a dumb idea?

2) Any chance you guys would be open to taking a look at a few of the ones I found and let me know if they are ""ok"" and worth the price they are asking?",1,1585533008,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frhz9e/help_buying_a_streaminggaming_setup/,Twitch,1
frhp21,DaSpanishBoi,How to stay positive on the Twitch grind?,"Fellow streamers,

I have been streaming for almost 6 months now and just hit affiliate a few weeks ago. I love playing the games I love, and being able to share that experience with others. I have been pretty positive lately about being consistent and not worrying too much about viewers/etc. Though the last few days have kind of gotten to me. My question for you guys is, what’s your advice on staying positive through the grind? I’m not in it for the money, but it does take a toll when you feel like you’re “not entertaining enough” or your “content is not worth watching”.

frgu9f,golembiewskiluan,How disasters can bring good stuff to your life,"The first month of this year was a breakthrough in my life. I was unemploeyed and desperate and then I found a really great job as an English teacher (they don't know my English is not so good) which I loved very much. I love to connect with people and teach and learn everything I can.

But then Covid19 came in to Brazil and all schools were closed. As anybody on the school that hired me didn't know for how long they will have to be shuted, they decided to fire me and the other guys who were hired with me back then. Well, it was very frustrating and I felt miserable. Desperate, again, to be honest. Because I have to pay my rent even tho nobody is hiring.

This depressing moment in my life actually gave me the courage to do something that I've been meaning to do for a long time: streaming. I just started this week and I've been streaming for some good hours with only my boyfriend viewing. He is being very supportive. I decided to stream the only game I really love playing, even though that, compared to other games, the number of people watching is very minor. 

After playing a few days by myself to 0 viewers I took the courage to tell my friends and now they are all being very supportive and playing with me. 

I don't really understand how this all works yet and I'm pretty sure thay my equipment is not the recommended, but I'm having a great time doing it. And even if it doesn't go anywhere in the future, me overcoming my image problems and going for something that I always wanted but felt too insecure is the greatest lesson I'll take of all this. I feel very fortunate to have all this tools right in my hands to improve myself connect with people. And I just found out that this is something that I could do for hours without the horrible feelings of obligation that I've always felt about work.

Hope y'all stay safe at home and use this complicated moment of human history to find more about yourselves like I did.",9,1585528590,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frgu9f/how_disasters_can_bring_good_stuff_to_your_life/,Twitch,1

But I have some questions:
1) I’m not sure that my computer could stream because it isn’t very good (but not a shitty pc). I would stream with an Elgato on PS4.
2) I’m not sure that my internet connection could stream. Is that any range of upload speed? I think I’m on 3mbps of upload and 25/26 mbps of download.

I’d buy an elgato game capture HD of 2012 to start because I don’t think that the 60S could perform well on my pc.

frg4ov,MrSpeedoMan,Microphone upgrade - Trade my Rode NT1-A for an Electro Voice RE-20?,"Hello,

My musician friend is interested in trading my his Electro Voice RE-20 for my Rode NT1-A + a guitar pedal I sometimes like using.

I currently like how my Rode NT1-A sounds through my Scarlett 2i2, but it does pick up some noise from my mechanical keyboard.  A noise gate on it really helps though! On the other hand I know the RE-20 is considered one of the best for streaming and many famous streamers use it.

Is it really worth the upgrade and will the sound be noticeably better?  Or am I better off just to keep running what I have?

freivd,TheRealBenHughes,My Twitch Streaming Wishlist.,"Hey y'all,

I really want to stream on Twitch but the thing is i'm really cursed when it comes to technology and I also feel like I need (/want) to upgrade my stuff that I already got so I can stream with not too much fear of something going wrong (but knowing me something probably going to go wrong lol)

So basically i'm listing off my streamer's wishlist and asking if I should look for something better or what I want is fine.

WiFi:

Current WiFi: Not sure but it's my parents and barely can even watch YouTube on it :/ and feel like I should get something for myself to put right next to my setup and connect via ethernet.

Thinking about this: [https://www.talktalk.co.uk/shop/broadband/fibre](https://www.talktalk.co.uk/shop/broadband/fibre) (i'm looking at the 28 Pounds a month opition as I feel like that make the streams run better)

Microphone:

Current Microphone: Tonor BM700 is mainly what I use for commentaries but I also have a Pronomoic VM-57 Dynamic Microphone that I usually use to record Drums.

Thinking about this:  [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rode-Microphones-R%C3%98DE-NT1-Vocal-gold/dp/B0002PSCQM?ref\_=fsclp\_pl\_dp\_2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rode-Microphones-R%C3%98DE-NT1-Vocal-gold/dp/B0002PSCQM?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_2)  Basically I want to use a microphone that will sound walmer for streams but since I have a working microphone then this should be the last on my list.

Laptop:

I know I will probably get comments to buy a gaming pc but I prefer laptops for my own personal reasons of portability.

Current Laptop:

Some HP laptop but the specs are  AMD A4-4300M APU with Radeon (tm) HD Graphics 2.50 GHZ

Ram is 8GB and the OS is Windows 10 with 64x Processor.

Thinking about this:  [https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/refurbished-acer-nitro-core-i5-8300h-8gb-16gb-intel-optane-1tb-geforce-gtx-a1-nh.q4aek.002/version.asp](https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/refurbished-acer-nitro-core-i5-8300h-8gb-16gb-intel-optane-1tb-geforce-gtx-a1-nh.q4aek.002/version.asp) I wanted something off laptop direct as you can pay it monthly.

UPDATE: I'm consindering getting a proper computer but I haven't fully convince myself as I can bring my laptop everywhere.

UPDATE: If I did get a computer I was thinking this:  [https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/refurbished-refurbished-acer-aspire-c24-865-core-i5-8250u-8gb-1tb-256gb-2-a2-dq.bbuek.007/version.asp](https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/refurbished-refurbished-acer-aspire-c24-865-core-i5-8250u-8gb-1tb-256gb-2-a2-dq.bbuek.007/version.asp) to save space or this:  [https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/refurbished-msi-infinite-8ra-core-i5-8400-8gb-2tb-geforce-gtx-1050-gaming-d-a1-8ra-298uk/version.asp](https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/refurbished-msi-infinite-8ra-core-i5-8400-8gb-2tb-geforce-gtx-1050-gaming-d-a1-8ra-298uk/version.asp) could be a more sensible choice for a streamer but I didn't want to get the last one as it looks cool I want to get it because it make the streams/any videos I make look better. I know I could build my own pc but i'm too lazy and feel like buying one will be a lot easier and then I can keep the laptop I have now for when I need the portablitiy use.

Some other stuff is if I should get microphone interface or lightboxes (or ringlights) i'm holding this stuff off if it doesn't do that much to do the viewer. I also have the logitech webcam C920 if I want to use it and I plan on getting a Samsung S20 mainly for the camera quality so that might be good but I don't think a lightbox or ringlight or a lamp is that important?

I also should also mention I mainly be doing console games with my capture card.

I tested it with Skype, it’s working perfect, and it looks great! However, when I try to stream the light doesn’t turn on and it’s not connected.

I’m not sure if that will fix my issue since there aren’t any YouTube videos or forums about cameras not working automatically on the Xbox One Twitch app. The Twitch troubleshooting for Xbox only mentions this:

“Your Xbox Live account must be in good standing (i.e. not have reputation that is too low).”

frd14c,firestorm_v1,Disappointed in attempted sign up for Twitch Prime,"Just got out of chat with Amazon regarding my failed attempts at signing up for Twitch Prime.  I've had my Amazon account for ages (my first order was in '05) and I've had Amazon Prime for the last 12 years at least.  I have never had problems with my Amazon account, billing, shipping, or anything until today.

I followed the instructions on Twitch's site to link my Amazon account with Twitch but when I tried to activate Twitch Prime, I got a generic credit card failure message.  The only place I put in card details was in Amazon, so I did the usual checks (bank good, card good, etc..) and contacted Amazon support. 

The agent was real nice but gave me some really confusing information.  First he said that I had to only have one address for my account (I have two, a billing address and a shipping address), then he wanted me to remove all but one card on the account.  I have 9 cards! (It is a business account).  

The agent advised me that the linking process is glitchy and tends to freak out when there's multiple addresses and payment methods.  Not wanting to put in a couple of hours into finding all the cards and re-entering all that info just for a few free skins, I just said screw it, thanked the agent for their time and closed the chat.

Is twitch and Amazon's integration really that screwed up?  Does Twitch really have a problem pulling pteferred payment method data from Amazon (like other card processors have done for ages)?

I can't be the only one that has multiple addresses and payment methods, can I?  What's been your experience?",1,1585514967,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/frd14c/disappointed_in_attempted_sign_up_for_twitch_prime/,Twitch,1

frcbjc,Budget-Cake,Would people be interested in doing online courses with an attractive and sociable woman?,"Would this be of any interest to the Twitch community?

I'm not too well off. Most of my interests are centered around cheaper activities including books, online courses, board games, and video games that aren't too heavy to run on my pretty crappy laptop.

I've been thinking of ways to earn money on the side besides my day job, while also ensuring that I do not neglect my hobbies, and I thought this might work out. I'd like to take some online courses during this period of quarantine, and I thought maybe someone might want to join in. It's way more motivating if you have someone to learn something with you (especially if it's a cute girl!). And since I'm open to learning pretty much anything new, if there's a course you've been meaning to take, I'm more than happy to do it along with you (provided it doesn't require advanced knowledge in a field that I have no experience in).

Of course, donations would be welcome but not required. I don't see it as a primary income earner, just something that could potentially help. I'm mostly looking forward to learning new things, and would do it anyway, whether this idea takes hold or not.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

fr8p1v,huntsman_original,Hosting My Very First Twitch Stream Today,"After spending all last summer building an outdoors set which includes waterfalls, a cottage and a giant crystal setting on top of a stone column, 6 months of concept development and 2 months of media campaigning I've attracted over 13K people to my Twitch Channel with my first 32 Followers set and waiting for my premiere livestream on Twitch at 3pm eastern today!

My stream will play out in episodic fashion with one stream leading into the next in an ongoing RL outdoors action/adventure where the stream audience gets to control different aspects of the survival game in an unbelievable open world  series streaming from 200+ miles of wilderness backed by a 10K subscriber base on YouTube. 

I'm extremely proud of the work that I've put into building my brand and being able to offer Twitch an entirely new experience. I've built my own livestream tripod rig that includes lighting, battery back-ups, a 360 adjustable mount and wifi hotspot booster pack all attached right to a lightweight tripod. 

Before the premiere of my Twitch Channel today I want to offer everyone one piece of advice that I've learned throughout this process. 

No one on Twitch will ever find you if you do not come up with a discovery concept off site. Twitch is not a discovery based platform. If you don't already have a following elsewhere it will be nearly impossible for anyone to find you if you're just starting out. 

You have to promote you Twitch stream on the level of a Hollywood movie. Photos, gifs, video clips, interviews, articles... an entire press junket. If you don't self-promote you're self-defeating.

We typically do the show live, audio only, and talk live calls using Blogtalkradio. Since all of us had webcams, I want to do a live video feed as we're recording. Here is the setup:

- Me, the producer and main host
- My computer sound and occasionally video to talk about
- Three other hosts, joining remotely via Skype.

I've been using OBS, and Audio Hijack but having problems with echoing because I have to pass my computer audio/mic audio both into Skype so my cohosts can hear it and also into OBS so that the stream viewers can hear it. When I do it with Audio Hijack it creates a bit of a loop. I also tried using a separate computer to Skype in and record my voice audio but that led to even more lag between audio and video. When I used Skype's NDI Source capture, the video was way of from the audio. When I just captured my skype stream it would be almost in sync.

fr6frn,Dhadden99,NEED HELP stream xbox gameplay to twitch on pc," 

Hi everyone, I'm having some issues understanding Twitch via the Xbox One. I currently stream via the Xbox One Twitch app and I just bring it up and it starts streaming my game on my tv, no big deal. It picks up my xbox headset perfectly and although I don't personally use the kinect for the stream, I understand it's an option. I've been strongly considering switching up my stream setup lately because I am very serious about streaming, but I have a couple questions. I was reading that you can actually keep the actual gameplay on your Xbox One but still stream via your pc, but for this method you'd have to have a capture card as well as a webcam. So here are my questions, and PLEASE feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I'm learning here.

1. Let's say I buy an Elgato HD 60 pro capture card. Do I just simply download the software and drivers onto my pc and plug it into my Xbox? And if so, then whenever I initiate the stream on my pc via twitch, whatever is happening on the Xbox would broadcast to my viewers?
2. If I do all this I would buy a nice webcam as well. NOW, how would setting that up on my pc work, because I'd want it to record me while i'm playing the Xbox, so would I have to weirdly keep the pc in front of me while i stream until I find a better solution? I don't usually sit in front of the laptop while playing Xbox so it'd be a bit of a change, but i'd have to in order to record myself, because the webcam would be attached to the laptop. Am i correct or no?
3. I currently use my Xbox One stereo headset to record my audio when I stream via the Xbox One twitch app. Would I be able to keep that source of audio if I'm streaming via twitch on the pc through the xbox one? Or would i have to buy a microphone/use my pc internal mic?

So basically what i'm asking everyone is if I buy a webcam and a capture card, is it possible to have a much more customizable and higher quality stream through my pc but still be playing the actual games on my Xbox One? Of course if I were a millionaire I'd just buy a gaming pc and this wouldn't be as complicated but that's not an option right now, so i'm trying to find the balance. I also understand OBS would play a role, in basic terms, of streaming my xbox through twitch on the pc, and i'm learning how to use that program to help me with that. Any advice or answers about those questions would help me out greatly and I would really appreciate it, thank you so much!!!

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE give me a few tips and pointers about this because I'm currently a little lost on the process. My pc that i have doesnt sit next to my xbox/tv so running the camera from it would be difficult. I've looked all over the internet and im having a hard time trying to find the right set of information needed to start streaming.",4,1585491047,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fr6frn/need_help_stream_xbox_gameplay_to_twitch_on_pc/,Twitch,1

fr58v7,relobc,Quarantineathon," 🎊 Quarantineathon 🎊

A quarantine streaming challenge to see who can get the longer !uptime in order to encourage staying at home.

I can see this working without a webcam but i strongly recommend one.

You can do whatever you want, game, cook, clean, sleep. As long as your there and its not against tos.

/////////RULES//////////

This challenge uses a HP system

Start the stream with 3hp

Every hour you gain 1hp

If you go afk you lose 1hp, and also 1 hp every 15 minutes you are away. 

/////////////////////////////

The game ends when any one of these 3 things happen:

1: Your stream goes offline for any reason at all

2: You run out of HP

3: You call it quits

Leftover HP at the end will be converted into x15 minutes. (4HP = 1 Hour)

//////////////////////////////

I setup a bot and uptime overlay with “Stream Elements” to help with keeping track( Ill include a picture of the commands i used in case you want to setup your own). 

Although if u dont wonna setup the bot then im sure you could keep track with Notepad and a calculator.

\--------------------------------

Just replace ""relobc"" with your username for the codes

I have set up streaming networks for a major company and have casually streamed once or twice over the years, but never for myself and never seriously. With the COVID-19 outbreak and my loss of work, I didn't want to ask for personal donations and wanted to do some good, so I did a **Charity Art Stream** this past Friday where half of Donations go to my local Hospital and Donations can suggest things to draw.

I may not have gotten any Art Requests, but I got donations. While I drew my own comics, I raised $175 USD. I got a donation after the stream was over that pushed it to $190 USD. I am Canadian, so that works out to about $260 CAD. Half goes to the hospitals, while I use the other half to offset my own losses. 

I wasn't sure what to expect with any of this. I didn't expect to make $10 and we broke $50 within the first half an hour. It was kind of insane.

I prepped all week and worked on a bunch of aspects to make this my first serious stream and I'm so happy it went smoothly. Even so, I learned a lot from the whole experience for next time.

Although I've known how to stream and have had the equipment to do so for years, but I never saw myself as a regular streamer type of person.

fr3c5z,-Tino,How did you discover about Twitch?,"Maybe you're an old schooler from Justin tv times. I am not so I don't even know what that time looked liked. Maybe you're a more recent viewer who comes from Fortnite blowing up.

For me it was when Call of Duty Black Ops 1 was hot. I fell in love with the game. It was my first multiplayer game experience so you can imagine I was all over it. I have the most playtime in that game than any other up to this day. It introduced me to playing online with other players. I guess the Fortnite kids are going through what I was going through then.

I then go to YouTube for Black Ops 1 content because I couldn't get enough of it. I begin following youtubers doing Call of Duty content, some grew up to be huge on the platform to this day. I then discover Twitter because it seems to be big with the youtubers often Americans. At the time no one used Twitter in my country lol. Between my time spent on YouTube and Twitter following mostly personalities around Call of Duty I learn about competitive CoD. Enter Twitch. Competitive CoD was bigger back then I feel. Good times.

I'm then off Twitch but I know of it now. The Witcher 3 comes around. Really my first RPG game experience. Fell in love with it, truly. I live in that world for a period of time. I now call it my favorite game of all time. I'm so hard for Cyberpunk 2077. Anyway after I'm finished with the game and its DLCs I get this empty feeling. You know what I mean. Now what? I search for The Witcher 3 on Twitch, I need more Witcher in my life. I find this streamer who is playing through the last expansion, Blood and Wine. I really took a liking to this streamer and follow him to this day, he became my favorite streamer. Between finding one personality I liked to now I follow dozens and watch Twitch daily.

But I'm really not that great- most of my stream is me gasping, swearing, using self-deprecating humour or asking questions about gameplay that only a noobie would ask (me!)

Is this content that people actually enjoy? I have a bit of a community going, and I think that's what I've been loving so far- building a community and playing games with my followers.

But I sometimes have a lot of doubts as to whether this is interesting content, or something it is something that can grow. I watch other streamers and they seem to put much less effort into engaging with their community, yet they still have tons of viewers and followers because they are skilled and fun to watch.

fr1ql9,Sydney_lb,I wanted to share my first Charity stream experience.,"I have a very small but amazing community. I average about 11 viewers during a stream and on good days maybe 20-25 viewers if I'm very lucky.   

With that said I saw Twitch was encouraging users to participate in their Twitch Stream Aid and someone from my community kind of mentioned in passing jokingly that I should participate. So I did. Reluctantly though, because all I could think about was what if no one donated? :( How embarrassing would that be for me.  I am a nobody streamer and my community are not what you would call deep pocket people. I NEVER get donations on a normal basis so you can see why I was very very nervous about this whole stream. But you know what, it wouldn't have mattered if I had only raised 1 dollar because one dollar is one dollar and its one more dollar that the charity could have had so I was like screw it, I'm going to do it.  

I think we peaked at 22 viewers but my very small community had a goal of 100 dollars and managed to raise a staggering 200 dollars! I was completely blown away. Literally emotional about it, being so proud to have people in my community willing to put other people first. I will be matching the initial goal of 100 dollars making the grand total from my community to 300 dollars. I know this may seem like NOTHING compared to larger streamers who can raise thousands but I  want to again stress, even if I had only raised a dollar it still one more dollar that would go to a charity that would gladly take it. I am beyond grateful for my community and hope this may inspire smaller streamers like myself who may be reading this to participate without fear of embarrassment because charity is charity.   

Lastly thank you to Twitch to bring this opportunity to me via your amazing platform.   

The times we currently live in a lot of people are struggling, suffering and need help. Every single dollar counts.   

Thank you for reading this and I wish you a great streaming experience. &lt;3",3,1585465307,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fr1ql9/i_wanted_to_share_my_first_charity_stream/,Twitch,1
fr1q94,retrodrewau,Blue Yeti mic stops capturing audio during stream in Streamlabs OBS even though it still has power," 

Hello,

I  have an issue in Streamlabs OBS last where the stream briefly clips and my Blue Yeti mic (purchased a month ago) cut out. The mic still has power and is still recognized by SLOBS/Windows, the audio bars just show that it isn't capturing audio , almost like it is muted (even though the mute light is not blinking). After unplugging and plugging back in it works again, but in at least one stream it cut out one more time 30 minutes later (also rectified by unplugging/plugging back in).

Upon reviewing the stream, it seems that the stream clipped and the mic didn’t capture audio after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have the log file, and noticed these lines:

\[000:01:59:25.198.271.900\]\[Info\] Device 'Microphone (Yeti Stereo Microphone)' invalidated.  Retrying

\[000:01:59:25.206.293.700\]\[Info\] Device 'Microphone (Yeti Stereo Microphone)' invalidated.  Retrying

\[000:01:59:28.222.946.500\]\[Warning\] \[WASAPISource::TryInitialize\]:\[Microphone (Yeti Stereo Microphone)\] Failed to activate client context: 88890004

Could this be what's causing the problem? 

One other question - I'm using the NVENC (new) encorder - should I be using x264 as an encoder instead?

I have tickets in with Blue and SLOBS, but so far their solutions have not rectified the issue. Can anyone provide any guidance?

fr19gq,FacchiniBR,What kind of OBS configs big streamers use? I've tried everything and my stream quality is subpar.,"Hello /r/twitch, how's it going?

I'm having an annoying issue here and trust me, I've searched and researched all over the internet. I also have an extensive background in video editing.

It's obvious that 6000kbps bitrate isn't ideal for high movement scenes, but how people do it and it looks crisp and not blocky and washed? 

I was browsing the same game I'm playing (Doom Eternal) and even from small streamers, the quality was at least two times better than everything I tried and my stream isn't looking fluid even with zero fps and frame drops.

I made three 30 sec to 1 min streams to show you guys how it looks, the configs are on the bottom of the videos, please ignore the title, I linked OBS with twitch after a full reinstall and forgot to change and did an even bigger mistake.

[Clip 1](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/578103001) - [Clip 2](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/578101857) - [Clip 3](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/578101280)

I can literally browse right now, click at a random 2 viewers channel and it will look better than mine even if the streamer is doing at 720p.

My machine is fine, my internet is fine (500mbps down | 250mbps up), Twitch Inspector says 'Excellent' and 'stable' and I can ping Twitch's São Paulo ingest server with 1ms. 

I streamed at 2560x1080 by mistake, but absolutely nothing changed, all my tests were made at 1920x1080.

I'm lost, there is a magic recipe or config that I'm missing to make that 6000kbps cap looks better? I've read all of the tutorials and almost the entire wiki and did everything. Also changed veryfast/fastest/fast encoding setting to placebo, same results with louder fan noises. I'm planning to do this professionally so quality matters, I know a lot of big Youtube/Twitch names and they will give me that 'hey, this guy playing with us is our friend for years, follow him' kickstart and I don't want to disappoint anyone. Their audience is insanely loyal, but it's the kind of watchers that notices every hiccup. This is a cultural thing here, irritating, I know.

Thanks in advance!

Additional info: I also tried to stream on Youtube (I will not stream here for my own sanity) and since it doesn't limit bitrate, I used 50000 and the stream was like a ShadowPlay recording. Changed to 6000 and it looked way better than Twitch.

I also tried Facebook to see the quality, it was marginally better and OBS can stream to Twitch and Facebook at the same time.

The even bigger mistake: The stats were showing ~30 people watching, I found it awesome for a test video and started to think about just doing it on Facebook. In a matter of minutes, my work phone rang and I realized that OBS defaulted to my business page on a full state lockdown Saturday night, I reinstalled everything and forgot to select the test page. The viewers were all my confused clients, mainly executive ladies in her 50's that received a phone notification about their financial system software going live but instead of update news, all they saw was some fat guys being chainsawed.",4,1585462830,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fr19gq/what_kind_of_obs_configs_big_streamers_use_ive/,Twitch,1

I was about 2 hours into my stream last night when I started thinking about calling it, since I wasn't picking up any traction, and I was starting to get tired. In the middle of me thinking about ending it, a friendly user stopped by to watch and talk shit with me, and we ended up talking about DS1, and how I've been stuck on a boss for LITERAL months. They suggested I switch games so that they could help me, and before I knew it, I had a few more viewers pop in to help me out. After having a nice game plan develop between the 5 of us(and a generous amount of failed attempts, lol) WE FINALLY BEAT THE BOSS! Shit was surreal to me. I was equal parts grateful, and anxious, as the 5 of us stayed up until about 7am, moving on to the next few areas, and boss fights.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to throw this out into the ether, as I know it can be a bit discouraging at times when you're just streaming without views, and playing alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

fr046g,mamachodegath,No one wanted my GIVEAWAY I was doing.,I'm still fairly new to streaming and recently got affiliated so the people that helped me get affiliated came up with the idea to have me fill a kiddie pool with orbeez and me chat and chill in it. I thought is would be a nice fun stream to do I also decided to do a giveaway. I told the people that follow me I'll be bringing back something for my Disneyworld trip to do a giveaway for them. I ended up bring back a cute pin and was going make handmade artwork for them aswell.Fast forward to my giveaway and kiddie people stream. Only one of my followers showed up which I was still happy he showed up. I stayed on for 2 hours hoping more people would show up but no one did. I decided to give the pin and artwork to the follower chilling with me. He proceeded to tell me no thank you. Which was okay aswell. But on stream I was doing my best to not break down. I felt super embarrassed. I had one good friend that jumped in my stream at the last minute saying he wanted to join the giveaway. So I ended sending him the pin and art work and thank you later for being a supportive friend. He really appreciated the gift bag I prepared for him. After that stream I wanted to quit and die of embarrassment..just broke my heart I wanted to do something nice. Sorry for any mistakes in spelling or grammar. I struggle with both.

fqzvir,link_3007,Fake Giveaways scams on top of the browsing section is a huge problem,"So I'm not sure if this is something new, but I've been seeing this for a while now, and I am quite shocked that twitch is not doing much to prevent it. 

I was browsing through twitch when I came across something quite suspicious: a shroud stream. This caught my attention since shroud has been streaming on Mixer for a while now. From what I've gathered the people running these scams collect old footage of csgo pros playing, put some overlays on the stream that say stuff like: ""I'm giving away skins. Type !skins in chat to get one for free"", which leads you to a link that asks you to input your steam info.

This wouldn't be such a big deal if this streams weren't on the top of the browsing section (they probably pay for views, but still). Its always the same steps: Pick a csgo pro (shroud, s1mple, stewie2k, etc), slap a generic overlay that prompts the viewer to type a command, click a link to steal your info.

Imo, the sketchiest thing about this is that they even go out of their way to delete messages that call them out for the scam. I'd just wish twitch would do something about this.",3,1585456317,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fqzvir/fake_giveaways_scams_on_top_of_the_browsing/,Twitch,1
fqzvdg,OrbWeaver555,How helpful is it to have a channel name that shortens to your alias?,"I've wanted to start streaming for a long time but could never decide on a channel name. None of the online aliases I use now are something I'd want to stream under and none contain an easily extrapolated name. My online friends tend to call me by my first name, but I don't know if I want my viewers to do so.

I know that when it comes to branding, less is always more. Fewer characters, fewer colors, and easily read icons are best, but Twitch is so saturated that it's hard to find a unique name. I have a memorable username, but it's not exactly snappy. My question is, in your opinion, how necessary is simple branding? Should you have the name your viewers will refer to you with in your channel name? Should I keep spending energy thinking about this?

TL;DR  How important is having a simple ""brand?"" Should I keep trying to come up with one?",1,1585456297,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fqzvdg/how_helpful_is_it_to_have_a_channel_name_that/,Twitch,1

fqyjyb,KlawwStrife,"running into computer slow down when i'm opening obs or streaming with streamlabs? not sure what's causing this, didn't happen two days ago","I stream off and on, but i've streamed a few days this week and had no issues-  


  
I was looking into ways to improve my stream and downloaded streamlabs obs.  I was having trouble figuring it out, figured i'd just start streaming for the night and figure it out tomorrow.  So I opened up OBS, but when I did that OBS was acting SUPER sluggish.  like the levels in the mixer were only updating once ever 2-3 seconds, if i moused over a button it didn't highlight for a few seconds, etc.  The preview image seemed to be fine, my game was idling fine, and when i waved my arm in front of the camera, the preview image would reflect it just as normal.  (note that other than having downloaded streamlabs, nothing in my OBS was changed from a run of the mill, no issues stream yesterday)  


but then when i went to google this, i noticed that my task bar was acting just as sluggish.  had to hover over the chrome logo for a good few seconds before it'd highlight.  anything with the system was being sluggish, but once i was actually into chrome or discord it'd be fine.  


I closed OBS and waited a bit and everything went back to normal. Decided to try streamlabs, it didn't have these issues.  so i figured out how to get it up and running and streamed.  I went about 4 hours, and never did run into these issues from what i could tell.  chat was running normally, levels were updating constantly like normal.  And then I needed to alt tab to look something up--and it was acting just like OBS was before.  task bar is slow, desktop is slow etc etc.    


I stopped the stream and even now about an hour later, when i switch to discord, the chrome tab is still highlighted as if i was on it for about 10 seconds and right clicking on an icon takes a few seconds to bring up the menu.    


Any ideas why this would happen?  I haven't changed anything else, I can't imagine what would cause this.",0,1585450788,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fqyjyb/running_into_computer_slow_down_when_im_opening/,Twitch,1

Twitch has removed the ability to **SEE** chat if you're b@|\|n3d from the channel. Nice to see that Twitch team is keeping their priorities straight.

Why? What is the point of this? You couldn't chat already if you were meme'd so what is the point of this change?

I liked seeing chat's reaction to the stream, y'know, kinda the whole point of Twitch other than watching streams.

For those who are curious, i got perma-meme'd from one stream that i like for saying something that triggered one of the mods. Don't worry i was not spamming n-words or anything like that.

Sorry if these are really basic questions, but I've been wanting to do live streaming but not found a good platform for it. What I want to do is dancing, drawing, practicing Chinese calligraphy, etc. I know Twitch is more dedicated to gaming, so is it OK to stream traditional art, dance, or exercise instead?

Also, right now I just have a Macbook air laptop. Would I need a more heavy duty computer even if I'm not streaming games off my computer? Or will the live stream alone require a heavier system? 

As you might be able to tell, I'm not very tech-savvy, would that be hard for me when it comes to streaming on Twitch?

I live-streamed for a while on younow and had a lot of fun with some of the community but... a lot of it is not great.

If you don't think Twitch is right for me would you have any other recommendations?

Is it possible to obtain the same outcome if each streamer was at their own respective houses?

outside of not being able to afford an office for us to setup our rigs and group stream, some of us are in different states and wouldn't be comfortable moving. This is more of a hobby for some of us anyways. We do know one thing, we want to remain part of the same brand. Sometimes the stream would just be one person playing a single player game, but if it's a group game like PUBG we don't want to have to pick one streamers perspective, or take turns.

fqug0l,chessentials,Unable to Solve Blue Yeti Mic Buzzing Sound,"Hello everyone,For 1.5 years, I have been using the Blue Yeti Mic without any problems. But after the latest Windows 10 Update, it started buzzing like crazy, as can be seen in the video:  [https://streamable.com/j05rk](https://streamable.com/j05rk). I am also unable to get any sound from its headphones jack.

Now, after googling, I quickly discovered I am far from being the only one with the given problem. Multiple videos and threads offered different solutions and here are some of the stuff I tried:

1. Placing the mic on a blanket to reduce vibrations from fans
2. Removing it completely from the table
3. Plugging it into different USB ports
4. Changing all kinds of settings. Several videos suggested reducing the volume of the mic in sound control panel and increasing the gain, but nothing worked. I tried all other sorts of setting without any success.
5. Reinstalling audio drivers.

I would have thought the mic is just dead. But I tried plugging it into my laptop (with Windows 7) and it works without any problems (okay, the sound is horrible, but there is no buzzing and I checked that Blue Yeti is indeed the one picking up the sound in the video below): [https://streamable.com/o3hlv](https://streamable.com/o3hlv)

So yeah, if anyone knows what else is there to do (I haven't tried buying a USB hub or changing the cable and I also read it might be a problem of power socket, although both my laptop and desktop are connected to the same socket so I suspect it is a software problem).

I also just now realized I haven't tried updating OBS software, but I am really desperate for help, if anyone has any smart advice.

I use Microsoft Windows 10 Pro with AS Rock-B450-HDV motherboard and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphic card (which comes with separate audio drivers).Sorry for longer post and thanks!

fqreuz,lpupzl,twitch charity stream for the elderly and those affected by COVID19," 

Hello Everyone,

For my entire life, I have never been able to get a job due to an obstacle that constrains me from doing so. However, over the years I have started to adopt a positive mindset in how one should approach life. I mean why should I sit down and wallow every day in sadness when I can instead use that energy to not only turn that frown upside down but to share it with other people. So instead of allowing it to limit me, I have called it an obstacle because obstacles can be overcome. So what I have done in the past was to use my free time to help those in need. 

I started a club at my local community college in which helps people be more informed about college in manners such as how to sign up to 4-year universities, where to get financial help, sponsorships, and networking. I am writing to everyone here because  as a kid i  loved seeing people helping out others in need and during these tough times I have decided to do something that both allows me to help the community by giving back and connect with them in a whole new level that I believe many of us have never seen in a way did before. 

That is not the only type of community involvement I have participated in. Currently, I am streaming on Twitch.tv and was running a dog charity stream in which the money donated was used to give back to animal shelters since many of them struggle with the high intake of dogs that come in. 

As you may know, streaming is the new sensation that is taking storm in the entertainment industry. Millions of people from all over the globe tune in to see their favorite personalities from the comfort of their own home. I mean, we have all heard of the streamer by the name of NINJA by now, appearing on commercials, talk shows and even in sneaker deals, but streamers are much more than internet celebrities.

 Streamers are known to help out in various ways such as doing charity streams to help those in need. For example, some streamers will help others pay for their medical bills, raise money for cancer research and help those who are in the need of help financially.

 So this got me thinking there is a lot of people who are suffering right now due to the virus going around. Some people are not at work, getting fired or let go, or just can't meet ends meet at this time. So, I want to be able to give back to the community by doing a local charity stream and use the money to pay it forward for all the people affected at this time and also go and support local restaurants and shops.      

 Here is the great thing, people don't have to donate if they don't want to. By them just tuning in (which is free ),and talking in the chat room helps alleviate a lot of the stress a lot of us are feeling right now, so it can be a safe place for people to escape and express their emotions. It also allows our message to be heard by others. 

Please allow me to help those in need by sending this message to others who also want to help the community but may also be limited in what they can do. We can all get through this. We may be separated at this time physically but that doesn't mean that we can’t be there for everyone spiritually. Because remember, this is an obstacle that we can overcome and like I tell my viewers on the channel YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU SET YOUR MIND TOO. 

So i wanted to see what you all thought and wanted to give your opinion on this and see if i should go through with it and help those in my community. it is the first time i have tried reaching out here on the internet, and i also wrote a similar letter to my local news station to see if they would want to help out as well. Thanks for any feedback it is really appreciated.

\-Sincerely PUPZ

fqqdpg,Swartschenhimer,"New to Twitch and just got Affiliate, looking for advice","Hello!

I'm relatively new to Twitch and just got Affiliate. I've watched Twitch on and off for a couple years now; just casually some of the top big name streamers streaming the big games, so I know a little bit of the culture but not nearly enough to be successful. 

I was able to get a big audience for my first actual live stream which got me a lot of views and followers, and I just kind of knocked out the 6 more streams to get to Affiliate without knowing where I want to take this.

I'm a professional video editor and motion graphics animator so I thought Twitch would be a fun outlet to play video games (which I love) and make cool content (which I'm good at).

I like to play the popular competitive games when they're hot: Overwatch, Fortnite, Rocket League, Apex, and now Warzone. But I know it's pretty insanely difficult to gain a new following playing those games so I'm debating if it's worth the effort to put into building a stream if I play those games or switch to playing games I'm less fond of. I also play on PS4 which I don't know if that hinders my appeal. I do have a decent beginners set up with a capture card, DSLR webcam, snowball mic, lighting, etc.

So I'm just looking for any friendly advice on how to build out my stream a little bit more, how to use my video and animation and design skills to make it more appealing (should I design some emotes now? or would it be better to create some highlight videos?) I also don't know much about the more complex side of Twitch like what panels are best or exactly what bots do for chat. What's the best way to network?

So yeah I'm just a noob haha

fqp52n,degen42069,Multiple DJ stream logistics question,"Hello, streamer X sometimes does a stream which features various DJ's. The DJ's are in different locations, so they are not all in the same studio. After one set, it will change stream to a completely different set which is in a different location.

My question is how is this possible? Basically is there a way for the DJ's to stream their video+audio to the streamer X, who then stream it out? Or do you think the DJ's just have the password and access the streamer X Twitch account directly and then stream to there?

If it's the first option, wouldn't that require a ton of bandwidth? In real-time, you are receiving audio+video, adding stuff like overlay etc., and then streaming out that video+audio to your Twitch channel.

My question to you all is, **how do you handle the ending of a game with your viewers?** I haven't really thought of it myself until I actually got to that point. I just started talking about how I felt about the ending and what I could have done different. But part of me felt that I didn't engage that discussion as much as I should have.

fqlsnq,xxalphatubexx,Transitioning from working Full-Time to streaming Full-Time: who has done it and what should I expect?,"What's up guys. Little preface about myself first. I am already self-employed and have ran my own business for several years now. I've been Full-Time employed since I was 15 and have never not had a job. The past 2 years I made my income from my construction company, my giveaway company (geared toward streamers and esports companies), and streaming on Twitch about 15 hours a week (which is all I could physically handle since apparently we have to sleep to stay healthy). Like many, I want to stream Full-Time to support my living situation and pay the bills. I have a wife and two kids and we're in a pivotal part of our lives and are moving out of California to another state which has opened the opportunity of going for this full time twitch deal since my wife makes decent money and cost of living is much cheaper where we are moving.

I am a Partner on Twitch and have a really awesome community, but given I haven't had the opportunity to dedicate my focus, time, and energy all into Twitch, I really don't know what to expect as a full time streamer. I've been streaming over 2 years now. I have a strong business background so I've applied that to my brand, and I treat streaming as a business because that is exactly what it is. I am so interested in converting my lifestyle from chasing after money and working non-stop doing things I don't particularly enjoy, into making far less if necessary but being happier doing something I'm truly passionate about which is undoubtedly content creation and streaming on Twitch. I don't make enough yet streaming just the 15+ weekly hours I've streamed with a set schedule, but I do most definitely see the potential of it being a very real career path if I pursue it without the distractions of working elsewhere and devoting a legitimate amount of time towards this business.

I am looking to hear genuine feedback from others with similar experience streaming on twitch. I know there are a ton of variables, especially with how individually different every brand, personality, and channel is, but I know there are others out there who have taken this leap and this dream is now a reality for them. I know a huge aspect is life around streaming so I think it's important to note that my wife is supportive (and games with me sometimes) of this and has seen that twitch is something I can possibly make into a career path.

I'm curious about schedules, generalized pay increase after switching, successes, failures, how long it took, and really anything you think is pertinent to this question or things I should expect. You guys can ask me questions if more info is needed that I've left out.

I have never not had either a Full-Time job or good income from self employment so this is a scary yet exciting and new thing for me to tackle.

I was thinking a great starting point was Earthbound, never played it but I know it's one of the most amazing games.  


Any suggestions would be great, in addition, do these games all fall under the ""Retro"" category on Twitch or do they have their own subsections.

fqjqf7,CatlessCat,Twitch buffering issues,"I've been having buffering issues for a long time now. Lately, I've decided to check and maybe somehow fix the issue. I've tried many possible solutions I've found but none of them helped.
I'm using Chrome, and here's what I tried:
Changing DNS.
Disabling hardware acceleration.
Blocking specific IP ranges.
Clearing cache and cookies.
Disabling AVAST.
Using a VPN.
Using incognito mode.
Changing browser (Edge, Firefox).
Checking with my ISP.
My internet speed shows ~90 mbps download and 3 mbps upload on both fast.com and speedtest.net.

Now, it gets weirder, and I don't know how to properly explain it so I'll include everything I've done in order:
I've opened twitch.tv on Chrome to watch a certain streamer (it happens on all streams I've checked), and it buffers (if I set it to auto it'll go down to 160p and still buffer from time to time). Then I decide to download the Twitch desktop app, and I open the same streamer, and the stream works on the best quality (1080p) with no buffering. After some time, it starts buffering the same way it did before, so I closed the application, opened the stream on Chrome again, and it works perfectly fine. After some time, it starts buffering again, so I open the twitch application again, and now the twitch application works perfectly fine. (?????????????)
Then, I decide to swap to some random streamer to check (on the application), and his stream gets super laggy, so I switch back to the streamer I was watching, and his stream gets super laggy (buffering) as well. Then I open his stream on Chrome, and his stream works PERFECTLY FINE.
I honestly don't get it. Any ideas? Anything will be greatly appreciated.",1,1585400343,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fqjqf7/twitch_buffering_issues/,Twitch,1

The issue is, the streamer has told me not to post the clip because (something akin to) ""I don't feel reddit is the place for product placement.""

I'm unfamiliar with how r/Twitch works and Reddit in general. So is the streamer in my honest opinion.

fqhctf,Distinct-String,Finding balance between streamer and viewers,"So I'm a fairly small streamer and when I started streaming having a group of people to play with seemed like a great advantage, soon after I started I managed to build a small community of viewers that I started playing with.

Now this is where the problems started, before this these people were just viewers &amp; subs but as soon as we started playing together they stopped viewing and subbing.

Quite afew of them started being quite toxic aswell to the point I had to mute discord during streams, then if i wasn't on discord they would come make shitty comments in my chat and leave. Since then it hasn't got any better and got to the point where I don't feel like streaming anymore or playing with any of them, if I don't stream they say I never stream so I load it up and they don't even come view, if i'm not on discord they complain.

Most streamers seem to be able to jump in and out from a 'i'm playing by myself' to 'lets play and have some fun for abit' without getting hassled.

Normally i'm a pretty tough guy in real life and wouldn't take this shit but finding it hard to deal with online, the more I'm writing about this situation the more its becoming obvious that I'm somewhat being emotionally bullied by this group but I cannot find away to 'reset' what i've already set in motion.

I guess going forward my questions would be

How do you find a balance between yourself and viewers?

How do you deal with toxic members of your community?

In situations where you would normally punch someone in the face, how do you deal with these situations online?

Since I'm still not even an affiliate on twitch, I don't wanna spend a whole lot on it but I do wanna buy one. The original plan was just going on amazon and buying one that had AV cables (the cables for oldish consoles like a Gamecube) and that had the Amazon's Choice thing. If anyone here has any recommendations for a somewhat cheap capture card that works with AV cables, please let me know.

Also I might stream on a PS3 or some other console that used an HDMI so if you can find one that uses both HDMI and AV cables, that would be really good.

fqf06o,Sparky-Man,"So, I just finished running my first stream...","[... And it went great!](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/577225865)

I have set up streaming networks for a major company and have casually streamed once or twice over the years, but never for myself. With the COVID-19 outbreak and my loss of work, I didn't want to ask for personal donations and wanted to do some good, so I did a **Charity Art Stream** where half of Donations go to my local Hospital and Donations can suggest things to draw.

I may not have gotten any Art Requests, but I got donations. While I drew my own comics, I raised $175 USD. I am Canadian, so that works out to about $246 CAD. Meaning that's around $123 to the hospital, while I use the other half to offset my own losses (depends on Paypal's cut and how it works out on exchange rate).

I wasn't sure what to expect with any of this. I didn't expect to make $10 and we broke $50 within the first half an hour. It was kind of insane.

I've been prepping all week and working on a bunch of aspects to make sure the stream went well and I'm so happy it went smoothly. Even so, I learned a lot from the whole experience for next time.

Although I've known how to stream and have had the equipment to do so for years, but I never saw myself as a regular streamer type of person. I still don't, but I am somewhat interested in doing this again at some point. We'll see, but I am super excited about tonight.",1,1585377597,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fqf06o/so_i_just_finished_running_my_first_stream/,Twitch,1

fqeg7c,Kgnar,I just got Twitch Affiliate and I'm so excited.. but I don't know what to do as far as the taxes.,"I just hit the final requirement for Twitch Affiliate yesterday and I was ready to become an affiliate but I feel like it was worthless because of the tax requirements.

I'll go ahead and get straight to the point with explaining why this is such an issue. I'm above the age of 13 but I'm under the age of 18, meaning on a tax form I would be claimed as a legal dependent. I wouldn't get my own tax forms and all tax forms would be given to my parent.

Generally that wouldn't be an issue. I've already talked to my parent about possibly filling out the tax surveys and such but my parent made it very clear that he would be extremely cautious about this and not give away too much information regarding our general information

.... this includes our social security numbers.

I've tried explaining to him that Twitch and Amazon were reliable sites that wouldn't do anything except give us official tax forms and income reports but he didn't seem to care. I've also tried explaining lack of money and effort put into it would come out to be useful, I have a few awesome friends who have already promised a subscription to me so ""effort for nothing"" wouldn't be an issue.

I'm really just not sure what to do regarding this issue. I really love streaming on Twitch and meeting awesome new people and being able to take it all to the next level with Affiliate would be beyond amazing and helpful, I just don't know what to do if my parent decides it's too effort consuming or - worst case scenario - decides it's too much effort to allow me to become an affiliate at all.

Is there any way to get around this? I still really use the additions like Chat points, quality customization options, etc. I saw something in the Twitch tax guidelines about it taking up to 30% of my income if I refused to file the tax report, I'm fine with that, is there any way at all that I can get around it?

I really appreciate any stories of how you and your parent/ guardian walked through this or how you were able to get around having to file your tax reports at any reduction rate. If you have any advice at all, please let me know. Thank you.",2,1585374901,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fqeg7c/i_just_got_twitch_affiliate_and_im_so_excited_but/,Twitch,1

&amp;#x200B;

So one of the things I still need to imrove on, is the quality of my mic. I think my mic is a pretty good quality by itself (Behringer C-1U), even tho it's pretty old. It can be better tho. For the longest time I didn't know what I was aiming for in terms of the microphone quality/effect. All the videos I saw, had nice quality, but it wasn't clicking. It wasn't the sound I wanted. I came across Cryaotics latest videos on youtube today. His mic sounds amazing. I know it is also the way he speaks, his voice, but I also know he has it going through some kind of software. Compr. and Gate are given, equalizer probably definitely, maybe something else too? I dunno. 

So yeah.. now I know what microphone sound I am aiming for.. :D.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to have similiar kind of microphone sound/effect?   


I don't know what to call it btw, because I don't think it's about quality. You can have two streamers next to each other, both high quality microphones, but they set it up differently, so it sounds different, although still high quality.

I got a gifted sub so i'm currently subbed but not sure if I should sub w prime next month. On one hand it's kinda annoying but on the other hand I understand the guy is putting in a lot of effort and trying to make a living out of it (and isn't that far off, he has around 300-400 subs)",6,1585359941,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fqauty/whats_your_opinion_on_streamers_that_ask_for_subs/,Twitch,1

Some people have streamed for years to 0 viewers but enjoy their streams. But there are some people who act all happy and stuff in their stream but usually end it cause they get all depressed cause no-one stayed the whole stream.

But the thing is, I dont get why I feel depressed and stuff when no-one shows up but then get happy when some people do shop up.

But then I get disappointed when no-one shows up the next time I stream.

My question is, are you still going for it even if you intend to keep the video on Twitch? (or do you have of list of songs that you know can pass through and you play only those)

Or if you intend to add some music then you probably not thinking of keeping the video?

Also, are there kinds of music that are more tolerated from Twitch's part, like per say instrumental; if a song is not allowed, then neither its instrumental version would?

My graphics card is a GTX Titan X and my CPU is a i7 5820k. I have 32 gigs of ram and play off of a m.2. I've done quite a bit of research on OBS settings and I know I have the settings that are most recommended. My question is will upgrading my graphics card from a GTX Titan X to a RTX 2080 ti create a higher quality stream? Does the newer graphics card encode better with nvenc to produce a sharper image? Would it improves the smoothness of my streams? Or would it be better to upgrade my CPU? I stream at 6,500 CBR. I've also noticed that popular streamers seem to have access to streaming at higher bitrates than  smaller streamers.

In the last few decades, psychologists have rigorously developed empirical tests that assess the core aspects of personality. **You will receive scientifically valid feedback about your personality after taking this short survey (less than 5 minutes).** The feedback will be customized to your responses using the scores of thousands of people who have participated so far.

The test is non-commercial, entirely free, and as anonymous as possible. And, you will have our gratitude—this research is not possible without the help of people like you!

\*As a quick aside, we know that there are communities for survey-takers (e.g., [r/SampleSize](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/)); however, sampling only groups that are designed for survey-takers would introduce sampling bias and threaten the validity of any results.

So I've been streaming on Twitch since 2015, approximately, and I've gained a following of about 1600 (The baldie family :D &lt;3), which is all good and wonderful. I took a break from Twitch in 2017, due to life - Had to get a job and be an adult after graduating from my degree ... Anyway! I returned to Twitch this year (yay!) and... God have I missed it... I've been streaming for about a month and a half by now ... and I love it!  
I would say back when I streamed regularly, I would have an avg. view count of 15-20 people, depending on the time of the day, and what type of game I was playing - I mostly stuck to horror games, as that was sort of my thing. I would do these streams where I would scream my behind off and try to do speed runs of Outlast.  
But I've been struggling with getting many of the followers back to watch the streams. According to my twitch analytics, 15% of my followers have the notification bell turned on - These days I have an avg. viewer count of 5.  
So I was wondering if you guys had any experience in getting back to streaming after a long break, and what you did to bring back your viewers, your followers, and your community.   


Looking forward to hearing what you guys think!

fpxj8v,BigChunkyMeme,Why twitch.tv has better Moderation than Mixer IMO,"I'm not sure what flair this goes in because it's more of a thought I'm going to put it in discussion

Everyone now a days thinks that people on twitch.tv are game ended unfairly sometimes and they treat women better than men (true) but trust me its worse on Mixer and here's why

I streamed on twitch on another acc ages ago on twitch.tv. and I thought that twitch.tv wasn't gonna work for me so I tried mixer and it went great for awhile. But after 6 month's of streaming on Mixer I got game ended for

""Terrorist content""

Even though I was playing JBPP2 with the family friendly filter on with everyone in-game (my friends) not doing profanity with their answers and nothing was going on in voice chat either.

I messaged Mixer_Guardians about this and they said the game end will not be lifted, even though I have record streams enabled so they can check past streams for evidence that I did something wrong

Funny part about this is that I've seen kids stream themselves in Minecraft on Mixer make WW2 Germany Symbols and make racist remarks saying the forbidden N-Word with family friendly category enabled. They never got game ended and there is so many people just using the word like its normal.

I still agree that Twitch moderation still needs work but it's still better than Mixers.

TL;DR: tried mixer after not getting anywhere with my old channel, 6 months in mixer false game ended me for terrorism now I'm back on twitch.

Overlap?,"So someone way more into Twitch than I have been yet tells me that an existing Amazon username is not available on Twitch to someone else but can be had by linking the Twitch account to the Amazon account. Is this true? And what if someone else already had the username on Twitch before Amazon purchased it? If someone has such a name on Twitch and then changes from it or otherwise deletes the account or becomes inactive, would the username, when after one year or ten years Twitch finally recycles it, become available for anybody like any other because it was already taken before the purchase of Twitch or does it become accessible, if to anyone, only to the Amazon account holder whose username matches it (assuming this tale about Amazon usernames and Twitch usernames is true)?

I've read through many search results on here before posting, and I see where everybody says the recycling almost never really happens. But perhaps someone with a long enough experience on Twitch can say what happens in this case. Or someone can tell me that what I've been told about the relationship of Amazon usernames to Twitch usernames isn't true.

To add one more thing, I did link my Twitch account to my Amazon account to try to gain access to my username on it, but since then have found an inactive, empty account with that name. I sent it a message, and the interface made it clear no one's there.

fpwyfv,TTVItsMrR3d,Be a character- Be a wrestler,"I was listening to a TedTalk by Eric Bischoff and something he said inspired me to write this post today.

Quick disclaimer about me, i'm a small streamer, I use to be a content creator in 2008-2012 but I retired til  recently. So I by any means am not a professional but I think this will be helpful for those who are struggling to grow.

So in the wrestling world, you have to either be a baby face or a heel (bad guy good guy). When your bad, you have to gain heat either over time or cheap heat (making general remarks that will just offend). 

The whole point of this is to get emotion from someone, when someone is emotionally involved they feel inclined to keep watching, as being emotionally involved slowly turns into loyalty to the brand as they continue to watch you.

Create a character of yourself to draw people in. Once people know and understand your character, they will grow to assume what they will be watching. You want people to assume what they will be watching as they will keep coming to see you play that character. You can relate this to watching an episode of The Simpsons, as episodes may be different but the mannerism and the characters are the same.

You can check out the full TedTalk on Youtube if you are interested, this was a mix of TL;DR and my thoughts. Happy Friday everyone :)",8,1585315819,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fpwyfv/be_a_character_be_a_wrestler/,Twitch,1

fpwt0x,mulesky,Multi broadcast to several different channels,"Hello experts,

I'm new to streaming and have an idea in mind. Currently I'm using my desktop PC with an iGPU and a triple FHD monitor setup. On those monitors I'm opening different VMs which are running on other servers on my home network. Some of those VMs are Windows based where I'm connecting through Remote Desktop and some of them Linux based where I'm using VNC.

The content is text based (programming) and low framerate stuff (excel sheets, animated videos, poker tournaments but no 3d gameplay). I've tested streaming with 1FPS and a bitrate of 500kbps on 8 streams and now I would like to optimize the quality/framerate.

One idea is to replace my current triple screen setup to a two 4k monitors which I spilt into 4 FHD parts to have up to 8 VMs available in front of me. Different instances of OBS would broadcast then each quarter screen to a different channel. I imagine that some kind of NVIDIA card with NVENC possibility is necessary for this to achieve a higher framerate.

The next thing would be to move my webcam screen around to the particular screen and comment stuff. Audio should only be broadcasted to that channel of course. Ideally, my voice always where my mouse is.

My upload rate is 40mbps right now, with an option to upgrade to 100mbps. A several second lag is not an issue.

The thing that really surprised me is some of my friends I made through other streamers would show up regularly to just chat and hang out. With their help I built up enough followers to get affiliate last week. Tomorrow is my 21st birthday, and since I’m in the US that’s usually a big deal, but with the state of the world today I can’t go out and celebrate how I always wanted. The saving grace of the day is I’ve been encouraged to stream tomorrow, so I can still have some fun with friends and not be alone and sad in my apartment. Twitch has been such a cool platform for me, and I’m so incredibly happy I managed to get into this.",3,1585312500,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fpw649/im_really_grateful_for_the_small_community_ive/,Twitch,1

fpv5ly,Griz357,"Stream drops frames, with some games, unless V-Sync on.","So, it's like the title says. I will drop massive amounts of frames unless I enable v-sync. CoD is one game that does it and so is fortnite (don't care about fortnite just annoying). On top of this all CoD was also not rendering things at all. I am not exaggerating when I say that my CoD looked like a roblox version of the game...

I feel I have tried a lot of things and looked into it quite a bit. The only thing that works for the dropped frame issue is enabling V-sync which is weird since G-sync is on. (I was under the assumption they did the same thing). Even capping the frame rate doesn't work. 

For the rendering issues It only happens when I stream and honestly its unplayable because I cant see objects so when I go to move or shoot I shoot an object not rendering or run into one not rendering not to mention the game is un texterured and looks like roblox. 

Specs: i9 9900ks, gtx 1080ti, 64gb 3600 ram msi godlike mobo I am running at 2k 1440p and I am not maxing settings I am getting about 110-90 fps on cod with med/high settings. If you need more ask.   


One thing I was thinking was encoders? I am using the nvenc (new) just crazy to think my 1080ti isn't able to do it because I though it was a separate process anyway? another think to note when it was doing this my gpu was not even maxed out it was 70% usage which I though was weird.",1,1585307654,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fpv5ly/stream_drops_frames_with_some_games_unless_vsync/,Twitch,1

(luckily because I sing, it is seen as art, and I only have to pay 9%). 

I feel like there is a lot of misunderstanding about paying taxes for donations. I wonder if alot of streamers will get in trouble? Or maybe they just put it there because they don't want people to expect specisl treatment?

fptr9x,Souhien,I dodged a bullet with trolls today (in part thanks to you),"I am a small streamer and was streaming today and everything was normal when a new follower came, and he looked nice and interested on the stream, or that was what I thought.

Then he tried to use the !sr command and found out it wasn't enabled and he asked for the command, I told him I wasn't planning to add it since I am concerned about copyright problems and a little bit about trolls playing inappropriate songs or sounds.

Then I told him that if he wanted me to hear a song he could use the Discord group so I could give him the follower role that allows him to enter a voice channel and use a bot that looks for Youtube videos and plays only the sound.

Then he asked for something that was a hint that maybe he was trying to troll since he said he couldn't speak on the channel, I replied him that there the ability to speak was not enabled except for me, but that he could type any song he wanted, and he did.

I had my phone close to me while it was on the voice channel so I could hear the song but not been heard on the stream, my primary language is spanish so at first I didn't noticed anything wrong on the song, just that it was kinda like a rap song.

He immediately showed his disappointment that he expected the song to be heard on the stream, gave me the advice that I should enable the command since no one cares about a song if it's not heard on the stream and then left soon after that.

And carried on with the stream and didn't paid too much attention to it and was seriously thinking on a way to add a song request feature without breaking any twitch tos, until I checked the name of the song that clearly was not very respectful, then I googled the lyrics and there I could notice that the song was full of disrespectful words and topics, many n words and a lot of violence and drugs related words.

I felt relieved that it wasn't played on the stream and because I just read the day before about some tips to avoid trolls dealing damage to the streams and the communities like Discord, I just disabled the ability to post links and some things like that to the people that just arrives. So I was very happy with you people that helps inexperienced streamers to deal with these kind of situations and hope we all keep like that : )

tl;dr: I found out someone that looked nice was actually trying to troll me when I googled the lyrics of a song he tried to play, luckily I just read some tips here the day before.",67,1585299931,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fptr9x/i_dodged_a_bullet_with_trolls_today_in_part/,Twitch,1

* **Software**: I've figured out that I will need to use OBS so I can put things on the stream such as photos or other videos. Is this the best choice?
* **Camera**: I have a 1080p Logitech webcam in the mail. I may move to two cameras so I can switch between myself and a whiteboard.

We could play these minigames on stream and interact with chat. We could get exposure to other gaming communities. It could also be just some fun content. Choose a minigame -&gt; choose the theme -&gt; go live!

fpskgq,TibaltLowe,Branding and Direction,"(Posted first at Twitch Creative) 
I have been streaming and making YouTube videos on and off for just about the last decade. My accounts never really took off for various reasons but since this whole outbreak I have been getting back into streaming on Twitch.

Due to being small-time I had always made my own profile photos, panels, banners, etc. For this reason, I never quite developed my personal brand that was harmonious and good looking. As we all know, having a brand that is clean, elegant, harmonious, and captivating makes a world of difference.

After recently attaining Twitch Affiliate status, I am wanting to overhaul my channel's art to develop something unique to me that will be memorable. Unfortunately, I am at a complete loss of where to begin. I am in need of panels, banners, profile photos, emotes, sub badges, the whole nine-yards. Without having a brand and direction to go off of, this task is near impossible and quite daunting.

I am curious if anybody has tips on how to narrow down my soul-searching-brand-journey so that I am able to give artists direction on my channel art. Would anybody care to pick my brain and gain some insight into where I could take this? Does anybody have general tips? Specific tips? Direction or personal help? Please inquire here or in a pm.

fpsan5,Vennummmm,slobs settings for ryzen 2200g rx570 4gb vram 16gb ram,"I want to stream rocket league, rainbow six siege, cs:go, apex legends, and some others (less demanding others) at 720p or 900p (depending on what you think is better), What settings should I use on streamlabs obs?

Currently i have:

Output mode: Advanced  
Encoder: x264  
Output resolution: 1280x720  
Rate control: CBR  
Bitrate: 3000 - 5000 (I found 5000 runs better for apex)  
Keyframe interval: 2  
CPU usage: veryfast  
Profile: main

Base (Canvas) Resolution: 1920x1080  
Output (Scaled) Resolution: 1280x720  
Downscale Filter: Bicubic  
FPS Type: Common FPS Values  
Common FPS Values: 30

My main issue that I'm running into is that when I look at my stream on my phone it seems kind of stuttery (and sometimes OBS says it's skipping frames), but my game runs fine. It's mainly when I'm doing a somewhat speedy turn. I haven't tried streaming in siege yet because I feel like it would put a massive dent in my fps, and siege is the only shooter I take pretty seriously.",5,1585291636,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fpsan5/slobs_settings_for_ryzen_2200g_rx570_4gb_vram/,Twitch,1

so I  have been somewhat successful  in my goal at least way more than I have ever been on YouTube.

But my end goal is  to see bf1942 mods  being played everyday  to keep this game alive for future generations. 

  

because in a world were  gaming has become big business,  you will never see games like Battlefield 1942 with  modification support ever again.

fpp6yt,PanJan97,what's the thing?,"You know, the thing.. The thing that makes you not want to close this one streamers stream, or even vod. I thought it is there only with the bigger number streamers, but then I stumbled upon a smaller streamer, who had it too. Charisma? I don't know if it's that. It's close tho. Maybe it is just charisma, idk. It's this power that makes you into a magnet. 

I've been redecorating my room and the whole setup a lot in the past week, and I think I finally got a pretty good camera setup going on (it sucked so bad previously. The lighting, the positioning of the camera, the settings..). So now I can 100% focus on bettering my character, without the constant distraction of my setup sucking. That's why I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

What's the thing that makes you a magnet? I have honestly no idea. Maybe it's just shutting your brain off and letting go. The scary thing about that is, if you let go of the steering wheel, you can't steer the car. You have no idea if you are being magnetic, or just pure cringy. 

I had couple of moments where I was pretty much in the moment, but whenever that happens, I realise I'm there, and it fucks it all up again. Back to controlling everything. I wish I could just let the car drive by itself, that could be fun. I don't even know if these two things (the magnetism/charisma and being able to let go) are related. Maybe, maybe not. 

I would seriously love to know what the hell it is that takes my focus away from whatever I'm doing, and plants it on their persona. Maybe it is charisma. 

Anyways, it's 4am over here, I can't sleep, thought writing this out would help, turns out it doesn't.

I am looking for assistance in getting better quality out of my stream. I currently have a two pc stream setup using NDI to capture my gaming pc and sending it to my streaming pc. I use OBS to capture gameplay.

Specs for my gaming pc: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/8wgjb8

Specs for streaming pc: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/fR4Vb8

To my knowledge, I have everything setup properly. Resolutions communicating are identical. Bitrate is set appropriately, connection is over gigabit ethernet. 

OBS output settings (Gaming PC): https://imgur.com/a/O1Ta4Lb

Stream Labs output settings (Streaming PC): https://imgur.com/a/zrhpjQ3

The problem that I am running into is render quality. I have tried almost all CPU Usage Preset options through stream lab, while monitoring my CPU usage, as to not overload my processor on my streaming pc. I've managed to keep it around 80% usage while streaming, and not dropping frames but the quality is lacking on stream. 

Is the Ryzen 5 1600 in my streaming pc holding me back? I've narrowed it down to render quality and I am assuming that the processor in my streaming pc needs to be upgraded to improve render quality for stream. I've been looking at getting an AMD Ryzen 7 2700x to improve my render quality. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to why my streaming render quality is suffering? Would an upgraded processor in my streaming pc improve render quality while broadcasting through a two pc NDI stream setup?

I am finding it IMPOSSIBLE to stream Call of Duty: Modern Warfare while i crossplay.

I originally streamed straight off my Xbox One X with my Razr Kiyo, while i used my Turtle Beach Stealth 700s to hear the game and talk to my friends. Only issue is that i couldnt hear my friends game chat on the stream. Party chat? yeah. But game chat, nope. 

So i went out and bought the Elgato HD60 S+ and the Elgato splitter link, after having seen some reddit comments saying this would help mitigate the audio.

Only i've noticed that it is the GAME that sends the game chat to the headset, no matter the settings i have on my Xbox settings.

So i thought h okay, lets use that audio splitter to get my headset audio onto OBS.

Yet that also doesn't work, the capture card doesn't bring in the input or output from the headset.

I think that in regards to my voice, im going to have to get a second mic. But i have NO IDEA how to even go about the game chat.

fpmnh8,Hrozno,Is combining a league and workout stream a good idea?,"Hey streamy boys and gals,
I had an idea here a while ago doing punishment streams (like die in dark souls and eat a hot pepper kinda thing) and people said that may be tos (sucks for me I guess).

Either way I've modified my idea and am looking for feedback. Me and my friend wanna do a combo league Aram stream but the punishments are workouts for me to loose weight.

So for example I finish my league aram match and loose with 7 deaths then I do 7x10 pushups or something like that, while my friend queues me up for next game and reacts to chat/reads out messages. He'd be acting as the coach, giving me the exercises list and yelling at me to push myself (just to be dramatic).

I wanted to stream 2x a week doing this. No expectations. Just for fun. I'll likely also drop highlights on YouTube to try and grow but main thing is to loose weight and have fun.

Is this idea dumb? Are there things about this I haven't considered? Is there a section of this idea that doesn't make sense? Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

fpj06a,ProTommyxd,Chat VS Streamer in Twitch Dungeons,"Hey y'all!

So I always thought it would be cool to let the chat interact with the streamers experience in game. Have always been fascinated with Twitch Plays style streams. When I found Crowd Control (mod for a select bunch of popular games that allows chat to buy buffs/alter the game) I was excited.. but I still wanted a little more. Crowd control is a great idea but understandably has to be shoehorned into these games. Link to the past would be more fun if it was built for it.

So I made my own Link to the past/Soulsborne style 2D game. You (streamer) crawl the massive dungeon while the chat uses channel points to play as the dungeon.

Here are some things chat can do:

Trigger mechanical/projectile traps, lock/unlock doors and paths, change level layout/move platforms, drop helpful items, buff/debuff player, buff/debuff enemies, change weapons, drop in enemies and minibosses, weather/lighting conditions, teleport player..

And working on more.. the delay really isn't that bad and all options can be toggled and channel points prices set. This can create some truly hilarious chaos.

The game is based on classic Zelda style controls and gameplay so it's pretty simple at it's core. But I think this is a fun idea.. if anyone wants to help with this project or test hmu.

Also If you'd be interested in streaming something like this let me know!

Started to have the idea on having also another channel, but in spanish instead. The thing is that, if I do that, some things coud happen, one of them is having 2 separate identities, one where I stream in english, and another in spanish.

I would try to do spanish in my account, but if I did that I would be ignoring my followers (Almost all of them speak enlgish), and I don't want to do that.

Apologies if this has been posted before I didn't quite know exactly what to search for,

I recently made the switch mentioned in the title and have noticed that one of my Stream Labels is displaying that a regular sub of mine has only re-subbed for 1 month in total, I'm fairly certain they are on their second or third consecutive month and was wondering if anyone has experienced this same issue, and if so, how did you fix it? 

Hopefully this can be fixed as I cant imagine my longest subscriber is going to be very happy that his stats have reset (if that is what has happened here) 

I should probably note that my stream events haven't carried over either

fpgwdi,FitzyLU,"I've been streaming everyday on both Mixer and Twitch. My small opinion on it, and comparing the two","I've been streaming everyday on both Twitch and Mixer. On average for about an hour, to an hour and a half on each. Both have been a fantastic and super eye opening experience. The biggest thing I've learned, is that even if you play big games, people will tend to browse through and actually interact with small channels for a while

Although I've noticed a larger amount of viewership and engagement on Mixer, I've noticed a larger amount of consistent viewers overtime with Twitch. I've also noticed people are excited and want to engage, the more you speak and interact back with them. 

Things such as the Hypezone and chat interaction really help mixer standout. On the other hand, Twitch has a larger fanbase, it is easier to monetize (if you're interested in that) and being able to CLIP on twitch, is a massive game changer, sincr advertising on Twitter and other social media platforms is almost a must. 

Overall, both platforms are great and I can't wait to see how they both grow with one another. I'm going to do my best to stream daily on both and see where it takes me. I'll hopefully have more updates in the future. 

I'd love to hear everyone else's opinion on this!

TL:DR - I've been streaming on both Twitch and Mixer daily, both are great!",0,1585247633,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fpgwdi/ive_been_streaming_everyday_on_both_mixer_and/,Twitch,1

I've been streaming on Twitch for quite sometime, and I switched to dual PC a little while back. I see to be having issues with three things:

* Music playing on Spotify is stuttering, but voice chat and in game audio seem ok.
* The voices of the people I'm talking to are higher pitched than what they actually are.
* I can't hear alerts coming from my streaming PC into my gaming PC.

I can post an example of it if it's necessary. I'm just not too sure if it would be considered as advertisement so I'll leave the link out for now.

Here's my the relevant (I think) bits of my current setup:

* **RAM:** Crucial Ballistix LT 32GB RAM
* **GPU:** ASUS 2080 SUPER Dual EVO
* **Storage:** 2x Crucial 500GB M.2 SSD
* **Mic:** Blue Yeti Blackout

**Streaming PC:**

* **RAM:** 32GB Crucial Ballistix Elite DDR4-2400
* **GPU:** MSI 980 ti
* **Storage:** Samsung 850 EVO 500GB and WD Blue 1TB
* **Capture Card:** Elgato HD60 Pro

fpcux4,lucapetrh,Need help setting up Streamlabs for a Podcast,"Hi everyone, I've been livestreaming a Podcast on Twitch for the past two weeks using Streamlabs. We usually invite two people on Skype and I use window recording on Streamlabs to get their webcams, while I get the audio from desktop audio. 

Everything works fine, however I would like to know if it's possible to add a track on streamlabs during the stream and make it so the viewers and my guests on Skype can listen to the music at the same time. I've tried some things, but if I play it from my desktop only the viewers on Twitch will hear it, while my mates on skype won't.

fpcu5o,IndisciousWrath,"If i stream to twitch it stutters, is it because of my PC ?","So i don't know why exactly but the stream seems to be stuttery with both 1080p60 and 720p60. im using NVENC(new) since i have a RTX gpu.

* CPU: Ryzen 5 3600X (4.3Ghz) || GPU: RTX 2070 Super || RAM: 32GB 3200Mhz (4x8GB Quad Channel) || the CPU load in streamlabs is under 14% btw while streaming
* My Internet speed is 1000Mbit/s down and 50 Mbit/s up (gigabit connection)

I've set the following setting:

* Rate Control: CBR
* Bitrate: 6000
* Keyframe: 2
* Preset: Quality (i've also tried performance)
* Max B-frames: 2

My Base ""canvas"" is 1440p and i'm downscaling it to either 1080p or 720p is that maybe the reason why the stream lags ? My games don't seem to stutter and i don't loose any performance. The Downscale filter is on Bicubic(sharpened scaling....) if i'm streaming on 1080p and Lanczos if 720p.

I thought that my PC could handle 1080p60 but it sometimes it even struggles with 720p60 for example, i tried to stream Ori and the will of the Wisps yesterday (720p60) and it kept stuttering. (i checked and my internet speed was also absolutely fine, even while streaming etc.). What should i do ? Is it realy my pc and i overestimated it's ""power"" ?",4,1585234456,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fpcu5o/if_i_stream_to_twitch_it_stutters_is_it_because/,Twitch,1
fpctdt,finedoubler,Do I just ignore viewbots on my account?,"So over the last 3 months, I've noticed my channel was being hit by viewbots. My concurrent before that was around 30 viewers.

So yes Twitch knows my channel was being hit by this but they know I didn't do it. According to Twitch FAQ, they said ""just ignore and don't make a big deal out of this"" and ""report who you suspect"". I tried to find out who was the mastermind behind this but I can't.

like a lot of other people I've decided now might be a good time to start streaming but I can't find a lot of tips for streaming exclusively with a VR setup, especially for new channels. I've been streaming minecraft (I know, I know but the shaders are so pretty in VR), superhot, and pistol whip (though in the future I want to do streams with tiltbrush) over the past few days but I have no idea what a baseline is for this kind of content or any way of looking out for what's a good idea or what's a cardinal sin because the only real VR content I'm able to find is beatsaber or vrchat. I've had pretty much no watchtime on the few streams I've done and while I assume this is normal being as new as I am I want to make sure that I'm not doing anything heinous that would drive people away or scream ""guy who started streaming due to coronavirus""

current concerns revolve mostly around not being able to see or interact with the chat and the worry that either VR content isn't popular enough or my content isn't good enough to warrant watching. Don't get me wrong I'm not doing this for viewers but yknow I'd really like to pull 8-10 people a steam if I can

fpct2y,Brittakitt,My stream has gotten randomly choppy after upgrading my pc and moving it to another room and I dont know what else to try.,"A few weeks ago I upgraded my PC. Afterwards, I moved my PC to a new room (I'm still hardwired with a 150 ft ethernet cable), added a webcam, and switched from OBS Studio to Streamlabs Studio.


Here are my current specs - 
CPU: Ryzen 7 3700x
RAM: 16 Gb Trident Z 3200
Graphics Card: EVGA GTX 1070 Superclocked
Mobo: MSI MPGx570 Gaming Plus
PSU: EVGa 650W


I'm currently set at 4500 Bitrate, 30 FPS, and I think 720p. I have tried both the nvidia encoder and whatever the other one is.


My upload speed fluctuates between 4 Mbps to 10 Mbps.


My stream is pretty choppy, and it randomly gets so choppy that you cannot tell what is going on (only visually, the audio is fine). 


Example clip of the issue - https://clips.twitch.tv/HedonisticCheerfulBubbleteaBrainSlug


Before I upgraded/moved my PC, I had no issues with the stream itself. I have no idea what to do here or what change specifically made my stream start getting choppy. Is it because my ethernet cable is way longer? Because I switched to streamlabs? Because I added a webcam? Because I upgraded my PC?

I've been streaming on Twitch for quite sometime, and I switched to dual PC a little while back. I see to be having issues with three things:

* Music playing on Spotify is stuttering, but voice chat and in game audio seem ok.
* The voices of the people I'm talking to are higher pitched than what they actually are.
* I can't hear alerts coming from my streaming PC into my gaming PC.

I can post an example of it if it's necessary. I'm just not too sure if it would be considered as advertisement so I'll leave the link out for now.

Here's my the relevant (I think) bits of my current setup:

 **Gaming PC:**

* **CPU:** Intel Core i7-9700K
* **RAM:** Crucial Ballistix LT 32GB RAM
* **GPU:** ASUS 2080 SUPER Dual EVO
* **Storage:** 2x Crucial 500GB M.2 SSD
* **Mic:** Blue Yeti Blackout

**Streaming PC:**

* **CPU:** Intel Core i7-5930K
* **RAM:** 32GB Crucial Ballistix Elite DDR4-2400
* **GPU:** MSI 980 ti
* **Storage:** Samsung 850 EVO 500GB and WD Blue 1TB
* **Capture Card:** Elgato HD60 Pro

* **Frag-movies:** Syncing music with best frags etc, into a montage.
* **Digital Art:** Logos, Intro/Outro, Banners etc.  


About Me: 

I have been editing since I was 14 when I was trying to promote myself/team to get noticed in the eSports scene, from promoting myself and my team I got to a point were I was editing Fragmovies for other Teams, Players, and got recruited in an editing team called Napalm Edits with other filmakers that were based in Greece. I currently work as a seasonal Tattoo Artist at Easy Rider in Cyprus and a freelance designer, I do anything related to art, sketching and digital - Tattoo designs to beer logos, menus etc. As a Tattoo Artist, it's not required, but it's an advantage to create your own art, that's where I got my experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

..for starters, i'd like to edit the Broadcasters' video for free and IF interested we can move on. I want to do this not only because I have a passion for art and editing, but because I have a passion for twitch/gaming as-well, I stream myself sometimes. I'm not asking for a lot of money, just a little something for the hours I put into. I'm not even asking for the minimum that Video Editors get. 

&amp;#x200B;

Payment: Negotiable

Software: Sony Vegas Pro, Pro-Create etc.

I play the game in 1440p and let streamlabs downscale it to 1080p. Audio, overlay, facecam, etc. works fine without any issues. However, my stream will have moments of clear 1080p then suddenly it becomes grainy/pixelated. It’s not unbearable, but it’s definitely noticeable. I’m fairly certain my bitrate is set to 6000 and the specs of my pc I can remember off the top of my head are:
CPU: i9-9900k
GPU - RTX 2080 Ti
And like 64 gbs of ram (not sure the speed but it’s decent)
My friend clipped the stream and i noticed how weird it looked. I asked another friend and he said overall it looked fine, but at times it got to be grainy. Any advice would be very helpful &lt;3 I actually was getting a second monitor today just so my stream saturday would be a better experience for everyone(i can read chat without my phone, have my stream opened there to check quality, etc.) Thanks in advance!

Like my goal here is to be able to play music out loud while gaming, but still manage to have open-mic rather than push to talk.

fp9mra,NaXter24R,Audio setup for multiple output,"Hi, i need some advice on how to setup my audio for a stream.

I'm using the onboard audio, so i don't have fancy setup. I'll try to explain as best as i can what result i want ot achieve.

I'd like to have my stream listen to: my mic, my discord/skype/hangouts (according to what i'll be using) voice chat, another audio output like spotify or a chrome tab, in case i need to show a video or something.

I'd like to hear the same without me speaking into my mic (i don't need to monitor myself during the stream).

On the other hand i need the guys on discord/skype/hangouts to only hear me and the other audio output without them hearing them again, so i can't output the same thing to them.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically is like outputting the same thing in 3 different way each with a track ""missing"".

&amp;#x200B;

Volume control is something i'd like to have too, both for what i hear and for wha i output to the stream. If i need some audio equipment please tell me so i can try to fix this. The only think i have at the moment is a korg nanocontrol 2 which i have no clue if i can use or what i can use it for.",2,1585220593,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fp9mra/audio_setup_for_multiple_output/,Twitch,1

New Clip contest will open up tomorrow on March 13th! Please continue reading below for everything you need to know if you want to take part in the contest!

We haven't seen as many entries to the clip contest as we have in the past, so we have decided **purple+ intros are no longer required to participate**. We hope this this will encourage more users to participate.

# Clip Contest Information

**What is it?**  The Clip Contest is an opportunity for /r/Twitch community members like yourself to gain exposure for their broadcast through various rewards, by submitting a Twitch Clip from their broadcast.  

**How does it work?** I will post a bi-weekly thread and sticky it for visibility every two weeks. Eligible community members will then post a link to their Clip, and the submission that gets **the most up-votes** throughout the two weeks will have their channel featured on the subreddit sidebar! The second week of the contest is reserved for voting, so I will be locking the contest thread **one week to ending**.  

**Are there any Rules for entry?** Yes. If you hope to take part in the upcoming contest, then you must abide by the following set of rules:

**Rules for Entry:**

* One Clip submission per contest. If you are currently in the sidebar, **can't enter this time**.

* The Clip submission **must** be from your own channel, and can't be a previous winning clip.

* The Clip submission **must** be a Twitch Clip and not another platform.  
  
* If your content is NSFW (i.e. profanity) then please **mark it** as such.

* [Purple+](https://purple.plus/) introductions are **no longer** required.  


**You mentioned Rewards?** Indeed I did, here's a list of all the amazing rewards you can win:

* Your channel gets **featured** on the next Clip Contest thread, and you will be on the sidebar for two months. We're hoping this brings your channel some **extra attention**!

* Your [Purple+](https://purple.plus/) introduction will be **shared** in the Winner announcement thread, so everyone can **learn more** about your channel!
  
* One Tweet of **your stream from our twitter!** (Must follow [@TwitchSubreddit](https://twitter.com/TwitchSubreddit).)^^^Must ^^^claim  
  
**Anything else?** Yep, here are a few mores things that you should keep in mind when entering:

* **Do not create throwaway accounts to up-vote/down-vote:** This is against [Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and anyone found creating throwaway/alternate accounts to manipulate the votes will be reported to Reddit admins.

* **Do not ask people to up-vote your submission:** This is also against [Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and anyone found asking for votes will be reported to Reddit admins. **This includes sharing your submission with your community in any format.**  

***

Don't forget to create an profile on [Purple+](https://purple.plus). It's another chance to get your channel out there, plus you get an awesome badge flair icon next to your name here on the subreddit! 

Also if you have any suggestions or feedback on how the contest should be ran or other ideas for possible rewards, then please reach out to us via [modmail] (https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTwitch).

fp8cqg,TWITCHAROONI,Worried about my twitch account.,"Hey People/streamers.

My phone was temporally stolen. This had my authy app installed, streamlabs for IRL, along with my main email address. 

After recovering the telephone;

The sim is missing, and phone has been formatted. Lost photos etc.. Along with authy.  Also I'm locked out of my main email address. 

I contacted my local telephone provider,  as its pay as you go sim, they wont do a replacement sim, and the number is already allocated for another customer.  If I ring it, it's dead. 

I contacted authy. Told em the story. They offered to merge the account to the new phone number, yet I have no access to said email.  if they need an email confirmation I cannot provide it. So have held off the offer of merging for now. 

I cannot remove or change my email in twitch settings as it requires Authy. Even though I have my twitch password and I'm still logged in Twitch on my desktop. 

Do you think streaming about this problem is a good idea? to prove it's me.  I know i have so long before twitch will reset my log in details. 

Just wondered if something similar has happened to any other streamers?  And did you manage to get  your account back / main email changed etc...

I don’t get many viewers but it has made me more determined to grind single player games and it has really helped me play better and not get in my feelings on multiplayer games. All in all streaming has been a big positive on my love for gaming. 

But with all of that being said, I think it would be a fun idea to grow a community with other awesome content creators. We can play and co stream together from time to time and help each other reach new levels. I’m not the greatest streamer but I have a lot of fun doing it.

fp4447,zWeApOnz,What is the best way to host a charity stream between multiple streamers?,"I am in the planning phase of an upcoming charity stream and have never done anything like this, would love some advice.

We have a few people that will be streaming different things throughout the day, but we'd like to try and retain viewership and not have to direct people to other streams. I was thinking of starting the stream and then hosting the others, or even re-streaming their stream through mine.

We want to have donations be able to appear regardless of who is streaming, so if I hosted I think that would break. If I pulled up their stream and then re-streamed that that would not break, but the chat would not go over to the other streamer, nor would any followers subs, etc.. that could potentially occur.

Is there a recommended method to achieve this? It will be bouncing around throughout the day.

fp1xzk,CommonGuy2,I have become a Twitch Affiliate!,"So, last time I streamed was 6 days ago (I'm on a break right now to fuel up) and I didn't get any messages on my phone. I knew that once you would reach Affiliate, you would receive an email. But I never got a notification.

The reason for that was because the Gmail account of a friend of mine was still logged in on my phone so I couldn't receive any emails from Twitch lmao.

I grabbed my phone and went to the Twitch app to search for a streamer. I saw that I had a notification and I pressed on the notificiation button. And suddenly I see a message from Twitch telling me that I have become Affiliate. And I was like ""EEEEHHH"". So I switched accounts on Gmail, checked my email and there it is. The email telling me that I have become an Affiliate!

The journey to getting a step closer to my dream was very hard. I started streaming back in 2017 with a crap PC and streamed Fortnite. I couldn't even stream for 3 weeks in a row. 2 was my max and then I would usually quit streaming for months again. And I knew that I wouldn't grow from that. 

So I decided to just keep it up and see what'll happen. And to my surprise, I actually kept up streaming for longer than 3 weeks (I'm on week 15 now) and I'm happy that I could finally see some growth on my channel! 

It's hard for us small streamers to grow and that's a fact! But as long as you keep up streaming, you'll get there for sure! Speed doesn't matter. Forward is forward!

I use SLOBS, I stream at 720p 60fps, and have my bit rate set to 6000. My streams look great. Now when to 10000 to drop down to 3000. I've never had an issue in the last 5 weeks. I've contacted my ISP and tested my upload and everything is fine. I've tried dropping my upload to 3000 and it struggles at 1500. 

Are twitch servers really busy affecting me? Is it my encoder? I think it's either twitch or my hardware or router. Any ideas or thoughts would be really helpful!",8,1585181162,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fp1bvw/stream_dropping_frames_never_has_before/,Twitch,1

foyn2k,BEAT_LA,I got into the Twitch Watch Parties beta and I have questions/feedback,"My community and I are big scifi nerds  (main game on my channels is Kerbal, so it makes sense) so for the last few months we've been watching public domain scifi flicks on Sundays. It's been all well and fun, but we've been itching at the bits for Prime Watch Parties to come out for months now.

Yesterday I go to stream, and I have a Start Watch Party button!!! So naturally, I freak out, can't focus because of hype for the next hour probably, then later on to close the stream we did a test run by watching two episodes of Star Trek: Next Generation. Here's what I was able to find:

* When you start the watch party, it puts a clickable banner at the top of your stream and allows people to join the watch party. They must authorize their device, which is basically re-authenticating their Amazon Prime account that is used on their Twitch account
* Thereafter, the main video player is basically just Prime Video
* My stream output is a small PiP above chat. Anything I output comes out of there, so I mute OBS desktop audio since the prime video player streams out the audio of the show/movie. Need to probably design a scene for it specifically

What I don't really like is how for viewers who do NOT have prime or otherwise do not click the ""join watch party"" button, whatever my OBS is pushing to twitch shows up as a regular stream. So this means my Watch Party scene will be broadcasted normally as if I'm not hosting a watch party to those people who don't join it. That seems awkward to me, it shouldn't be streaming normally after that and should only be doing the watch party stream. Didn't see any flaggable options to prevent it.

Has anyone else gotten beta access to Watch Parties? I'm assuming not many. I checked out the category and it was just myself and some other guy doing Survivor reruns lol. If you've had access, what was your experience? Any way to prevent the dual stream thing where it's still sending to the normal stream as well as the watch party?",2,1585171703,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/foyn2k/i_got_into_the_twitch_watch_parties_beta_and_i/,Twitch,1

I have been messing around for a bit now with my notifications for mobile, pc and email, trying to figure out what causes this, however I don't seem to be able to figure much out.  
In the last section of the notifications tab in settings on twitch, there's a ""Per Channel"" section, simply just allowing you to turn notifications on or off for the channels that you follow on Twitch.

What I've been trying to figure out is what causes it to turn them on whenever you follow a channel and how to disable that, so that it's up to me to manually go into my settings and decide which I'd like to enable/disable.  
Whenever you do follow a channel you can ""just"" click the grey bell next to where the follow button previously was, now replaced by a heart, however that's not exactly what I'm looking for - I'm more looking for a way to prevent the grey bell from being set to on by default.

fowgc7,zWeApOnz,What is the best way to host a charity stream between multiple streamers?,"I am in the planning phase of an upcoming charity stream and have never done anything like this, would love some advice.

We have a few people that will be streaming different things throughout the day, but we'd like to try and retain viewership and not have to direct people to other streams. I was thinking of starting the stream and then hosting the others, or even re-streaming their stream through mine.

We want to have donations be able to appear regardless of who is streaming, so if I hosted I think that would break. If I pulled up their stream and then re-streamed that that would not break, but the chat would not go over to the other streamer, nor would any followers subs, etc.. that could potentially occur.

Is there a recommended method to achieve this? It will be bouncing around throughout the day.

Though I have a few partnered friends and some of them have wayyy more than this, but some are regularly averaging 30-50 and don't really get close to 75. Do people cheat to get partnered and then they just get to keep it? Get lucky and then settled into a lower number?

I’m consistently getting A’s and S’s in expert+ and can do just about anything except Camilla (still practicing the new album and even older Camilla). I’ve also bought all the extra packs and mastered those. I’ve seen a few videos of people streaming this game with a green screen, which I think I’ll need to purchase since that seems to be the norm (unless there are other recommendations or ideas). I’m not opposed to spending on any extra accessories needed to make this cool / entertaining, so if you have any links to products or neat stuff please lmk. So ultimately just looking for tips for streaming this, in addition to some of the more specific questions below! 



- Is it more about the points or personality? Would you rather watch someone who is skilled and gets a perfect score, or who really has fun with the moves and entertains? 

- What difficulty levels would you enjoy watching? All the way from easy to X+? Or just X+?

- Should I include custom made content? I’ve been learning some of the tools needed to do this and toying with streaming them to change it up 

- What do I wear? This probably sounds like such a silly question but normally I’d just wear like leggings and a tank top.  What do both female and male VR streamers normally wear? 

- Any other tips or thoughts for a new streamer or specifically for this game?",1,1585152629,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fosxdf/i_love_beat_saber_and_echo_combat_and_would_like/,Twitch,1

Quick backstory! I've been streaming for about a year and I have a small community of amazing guys and gals from all over the world, around 10 ppl that we get together all the time on stream and have amazing time! 

So today is Leonard's birthday (I hope he doesnt read Reddit lol) and I told him that since we are inside, if he has nothing better planned I'd be happy to keep him company by doing a festive stream for him so we can all hang out together! 

What I haven't told them though is that I went out, bought a little something from a bakery, a small candle and I have a disco ball lamp on my ceiling too😂 and I'm planning to bring that on stream and tell him the little ""happy birthday""  song in the hopes that will bring z little bit of joy in his day and show him and everyone that we are not alone in all this even if we are so far away.

So this is where you beautiful people come in! 😁 If this sounds like a fun time for you guys and you want to participate in making his birthday a day to remember in this whore sad situation we live in, you are all free to come, join us and of course you can stay as long as you want! 

I'm planning of starting my stream today at 6pm UK time and we usually play puzzle/adventure games tonight we are day 2 of The Blackwell Legacy. 

Channel name is same as my username ""Tyrranosvmv""

I am sooo excited for this and I just wanted to share this with you! 

Whatever you do have fun have you beautiful legends! And take care of yourselves and those close to you!

fop6ry,FNMARU,Question about linking Amazon to new Twitch account and Prime Benefits,"Hello,

Since I had to reformat my PC, it's looking like I'm going to lose my old Twitch account.  
It was originally a throwaway, and Twitch now wants me to enter a confirmation code sent to the account's email address, which I don't remember and which might no longer exist.  
I can't even write them a support ticket, since that requires me to enter the email as part of the ticket. Anyways, I don't think I could supply any proof that the account was mine.

All this to say I'm probably going to create a new account, which isn't too bad - I never streamed on the old one, nor did I have running subscriptions.  

There are, however, two questions I'd like answered:

I had the old account linked to my Amazon account for the Prime benefits. Can I unlink it unilaterally from Amazon's side and link a new account so that it receives the Prime status, or would the unlinking have to happen from both sides, i.e. from the old Twitch account as well?

And, if I manage to link a new account, will any games I've claimed through Prime become available on the new account, or stay available on the Amazon account? Or are the free Prime games linked to the old twitch account only?

foopj2,huntsman_original,13K Views BEFORE My First Stream!! Does it Matter?,"I'll be hosting my very first stream on Twitch this Sunday (March 29th) as a continuation of a livestream series I did last year on YouTube. My YouTube channel has just shy of 10K subscribers and a few of them signed on to follow me on Twitch 2 months before my Twitch channel is set to premiere. But the few who have followed me to the new platform does not account for the 13K channel views I've already gained by promoting this new episodic outdoors series.

The majority of my past livestreams have been mobile and from wilderness settings. My main YouTube channel is based off of wilderness survival, backpacking and interacting with wildlife. During my first livestream series we built a cottage out of wood and stone entirely on the livestreams. I'll be bringing this same type of content to Twitch which seems to be something new for the primarily gaming platform.

The hook for gamers is that they will have the option of controlling what happens next during my livestreams. Viewers can change things like direction of travel, camp locations, terrain to explore, wildlife interactions, how my shelters are designed and more. All of which will be streamed from over 200 miles of wilderness in an open world style livestream adventure.

This gave me a lot of previous YouTube content and material to work with while promoting my Twitch Channel over the past few months. As we know, Twitch is NOT a discovery based platform. So promoting your streams off site is extremely important but also difficult. Even this Subreddit does not allow me to actually tell you the name of my Twitch channel let alone offer a link where you can join in on all of this.

BUT... YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and other platforms do allow you to construct a media platform to actually get noticed. You simply have to work them. As a result of working social media for the past 3 months I've gained my first 21 followers on Twitch and gleaned (as of this writing) 12,960 channel views.

I do visit and support smaller streamers. I think it's important to offer support, meet new people on the platform, make genuine friends and help each other grow. During these visits I see countless people streaming with 0 viewers and have less than 100 overall channel views. But these are NOT ""new streams"". They've been around for at least a few months. They just aren't working with dicoverability.

I already have a small-ish online following on all the major social media networks. I have a unique product to bring to Twitch that is marketable and past livestream content to offer as reference to the new material. My first livestream series on YouTube literally made my channel stand out from all others in my niche.

What I'm missing by way of insight is: Exactly how to the numbers translate on Twitch itself. Obviously Follower/Subscriber counts matter by way of rising through the ranks but what of this smaller more obscure numbers like the Channel Views you see on you homepage even when you're not streaming?

Does that number really account for anything at all?

Promotions and invites to the premiere livestream of my Twitch channel have been rolling out the past two weeks which accounts for some of this number. People just going to see what it's all about. Which still hold a lot of mystery to it which is important in promotional notions. People seem to like a little unknowing from time to time.

I also used the current number to challenge Twitter it get it up to a full 13,000 views before Sunday which actually got more retweets and attention than I expected. It's a fun little, effortless thing now. It also offers me just one more thing to use as a promotional tool. To be able to legitimately say I had 13K views BEFORE I hosted my very first stream. A good sound-bite but again... does it matter?

Any feedback, thoughts, feelings, advice for hosting my first stream is appreciated. I'm simply trying to understand the numbers and how those numbers are translated by the casual audience around the platform.",7,1585135623,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/foopj2/13k_views_before_my_first_stream_does_it_matter/,Twitch,1

foojxq,huntsman_original,13K Channel Views Before My First Stream! Does It Matter?,"I'll be hosting my very first stream on Twitch this Sunday (March 29th) as a continuation of a livestream series I did last year on YouTube. My YouTube channel has just shy of 10K subscribers and a few of them signed on to follow me on Twitch 2 months before my Twitch channel is set to premiere. But the few who have followed me to the new platform does not account for the 13K channel views I've already gained by promoting this new episodic outdoors series. 

The majority of my past livestreams have been mobile and from wilderness settings. My main YouTube channel is based off of wilderness survival, backpacking and interacting with wildlife. During my first livestream series we built a cottage out of wood and stone entirely on the livestreams. I'll be bringing this same type of content to Twitch which seems to be something new for the primarily gaming platform. 

The hook for gamers is that they will have the option of controlling what happens next during my livestreams. Viewers can change things like direction of travel, camp locations, terrain to explore, wildlife interactions, how my shelters are designed and more. All of which will be streamed from over 200 miles of wilderness in an open world style livestream adventure. 

This gave me a lot of previous YouTube content and material to work with while promoting my Twitch Channel over the past few months. As we know, Twitch is NOT a discovery based platform. So promoting your streams off site is extremely important but also difficult. Even this Subreddit does not allow me to actually tell you the name of my Twitch channel let alone offer a link where you can join in on all of this. 

BUT... YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and other platforms do allow you to construct a media platform to actually get noticed. You simply have to work them. As a result of working social media for the past 3 months I've gained my first 21 followers on Twitch and gleaned (as of this writing) 12,960 channel views.

I do visit and support smaller streamers. I think it's important to offer support, meet new people on the platform, make genuine friends and help each other grow. During these visits I see countless people streaming with 0 viewers and have less than 100 overall channel views. But these are NOT ""new streams"". They've been around for at least a few months. They just aren't working with dicoverability. 

I already have a small-ish online following on all the major social media networks. I have a unique product to bring to Twitch that is marketable and past livestream content to offer as reference to the new material. My first livestream series on YouTube literally made my channel stand out from all others in my niche. 

What I'm missing by way of insight is: Exactly how to the numbers translate on Twitch itself. Obviously Follower/Subscriber counts matter by way of rising through the ranks but what of this smaller more obscure numbers like the Channel Views you see on you homepage even when you're not streaming?

Does that number really account for anything at all? 

Promotions and invites to the premiere livestream of my Twitch channel have been rolling out the past two weeks which accounts for some of this number. People just going to see what it's all about. Which still hold a lot of mystery to it which is important in promotional notions. People seem to like a little unknowing from time to time. 

I also used the current number to challenge Twitter it get it up to a full 13,000 views before Sunday which actually got more retweets and attention than I expected. It's a fun little, effortless thing now. It also offers me just one more thing to use as a promotional tool. To be able to legitimately say I had 13K views BEFORE I hosted my very first stream. A good sound-bite but again... does it matter?

Any feedback, thoughts, feelings, advice for hosting my first stream is appreciated. I'm simply trying to understand the numbers and how those numbers are translated by the casual audience around the platform.",1,1585134803,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/foojxq/13k_channel_views_before_my_first_stream_does_it/,Twitch,1

foo4re,ThatJamesGuy01,Streamed for a month - Hit Affiliate what now?,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

So i've been streaming for about a month (two if you count the fact I spent 3 weeks or so fiddling with settings and doing occassional streams before really getting started). I hit affiliate on March 13th and am continuing to grow, however finding personal goals to aim for is harder now than before. While I was trying hard to get 50 followers, and stay above the 3 average viewers it was an easy goal to strive for. Obviously the jump to partner is much larger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if people had any tips of setting personal goals, if goals using followers/subs/concurrent viewers what sort of pattern should you use. Just to clarify my goals at the moment are as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Fix and update my panels (mostly find time to do it)

\- Increase average viewers to 15-20 (Currently im hanging at around 14-16 depending on the stream and luck, but my 30 day average is at around 8)

\-100 followers by the end of March (currently at 84) 

\- Put more effort into Twitter.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically TLDR, does anyone have any ideas for what sort of goals will help me drive towards growth, that aren't stupidly optimistic or too easy to not really be that much of a challenge?",1,1585132655,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/foo4re/streamed_for_a_month_hit_affiliate_what_now/,Twitch,1

fomy16,tevva_tv,Twitch username help? :D,"Hey all!

I've  recently been thinking about getting into twitch (and the content  creation world as a whole), but I wan to have a good username that I can  at least put up with until the end of time.

So, I have a few question for you!

**1) Which of these name upon first hearing do you like more? What thoughts come to mind? I'd love to hear your opinions!**

**tevva\_tv**  \- A name I'm leaning on at the moment, but taking more time to figure  things out. Flows ealisy off the tongue, seems like a cool alias  (tevva), and also similar to the japanese expression   **てば** (teba), which ""indicates emotional closeness or annoyance with someone""

**xCubit**  \- A username I've used for a long time. Originally was Cubit, but names  were taken. I like the name because it reminds me of the word ""cube"",  the word ""bit"", and other math-y computer stuff (bits, bytes, pixels,  tesseract, square, etc.). The ""x"" at the beginning feels right since  I've had it so long, but I still myself a little annoyed by it from time  to time (especially when people call me EKS-Cubit haha). xCubit still  resonates well with me despite this, and I may just end up using that  one in the end.

**2) What ideas do** ***you*** **have for usernames that I might adopt?**

* I  would ideally want to come up with a username that is easy to say, 2 to  3 syllables, and can also be used as an alias IRL (as opposed to a  ""channel-only"" name like OfflineTV or CriticalRole or others). Names  that feel fun, friendly, or even a tiny bit cutesy are okay too. Anime  sounding names are okay as well.
* In  terms of topics, I love math, science, space, computers, programming,  vaporwave stuff, video games, the internet, yada-yada so words like that  give me good feels. Words/names that mean something cool in another  language are a plus too. I also kinda like leaves, vines, or ivy  (minor). I can't think of anything else at the moment because my brain is fried, but I'm open to other things as well.

I  know it might sound silly that I'm putting so much effort into just  making a username, but I  really want to find something that represents a  part of me and makes me proud of what I'm known as/by, and since my  ideas are limited, I would love to hear some other points of view!

P.S.  Oh yeah, my real name is jon and I have strawberry blonde hair if that sparks any ideas!",3,1585125830,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fomy16/twitch_username_help_d/,Twitch,1

fokuhx,Booshie23,Signing Up For Affiliate As A Minor,"Hello All!

I am overjoyed that I recently met the criteria to be invited to the twitch affiliate program but I have some questions about registering as a minor (I'm 15). I saw that on the Twitch Affiliate FAQ, minors over the age of 13 can apply for the program can apply as long as their parent or guardian signs off on the affiliate agreement for them. However, I'm not sure what to do for step 3. Step 3 in the onboarding has the royalty and service tax forms, which requires that I put the same information that I did in step 1. In step 1 I filled out my own personal information for the main part as there was a section where my parent could put their name. And being as I at 15, of course, don't pay taxes, should the information of my parent go in the step 3 royalty and service tax forms? Because if so, then I would need to completely take my name off of the step 1 information form.?  
TDLR: So in short, as a minor signing up for affiliate program, do I use my information or my parent information in the step 3 tax registration forms?

I'm having some fear about filing taxes at the end of the year though about the Twitch income.

I'm in the U.S, which form would I be filling out and how does it get written down, would I be considered a contractor or a hobbyist? And if so a self-employed contractor, will the amount I have to pay in taxes only come from the money I earned from Twitch? Pretty much asking, as I keep streaming on Twitch and earning Subs here and there, the money I'd need to pay for streaming on Twitch and making really small amounts of income would only be a percentage of what I earned? I don't want to have to start paying money I don't have just because I stream on Twitch as an Affiliate. Sorry if what I'm asking doesn't make any sense, recently reached up to 70 subscribers the other week and just scared of when tax time comes around and I'll have to start paying more money on taxes then what I make on Twitch via Subs and Bits.

I'm a TV producer and with all the Corona Virus stuff going on, Twitch has had a huge surge in views and they're making a play at becoming (at least partially) a real content provider (no offense meant by ""real"" - what I mean is that they're putting out offers to pay for new ideas from the TV industry).  


While I knew of the site, I'm not super familiar with it.

Question - is there a way for multiple people to access and administer a single stream from different computers which aren't linked via LAN or hardwired?  Use case examples: a game show where a writer can be monitoring a stream and feeding one-liners to the host, someone else feeding key comments to the host to reply to, a curated ""green room"" where interesting users are held and then inserted by someone else into the game show, working as a control room switcher, and things like that?  


Or does it all have to happen on the master streaming computer?

fog4zx,MotherGoose26,The Game Capture Card that works with Mac,"I am not making any money off of this review.

&amp;#x200B;

The Capture card is called The Cloner Alliance Flint 4KP Plus

This thing is amazing. I have been looking for a good Game capture card that works with mac for a long time. I got an elgato and that was a bust, then I almost bought a black magic, but I read a lot of bad reviews for it. I finally found this capture card and I love it. I have a 2015 mac book air and I haven't had any issues. The one problem I have had, with my slower mac I can only stream or record 720, but that is a problem with my computer not the capture card. But with a more powerful mac you should be able to stream 1080 and maybe even 4k with no problem (I don't want to give a for sure answer, because I do not know at the moment).

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

It works

It is easy to set up

It does not take up a lot of space

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

With my slower Mac I can only capture gameplay up to 720

I have heard it is hard to contact the company for customer support

&amp;#x200B;

The box includes

The Capture Card

HDMI Cable

USC C to USB 3.0

Adapters to connect and stream footage/gameplay from your phone (No thunderbolt)

A free software (Which I have not tried yet)

&amp;#x200B;

I bought mine on Amazon, but I am sure other Tech stores sell it as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is able to help you guys. I know how hard it can be wanting to get into to streaming and just feeling like there aren't any good options for Mac users.

&amp;#x200B;

I re-uploaded this review because I didn't realize Amazon Referral links were a thing and in my original post I included a link to the capture card. I don't want anyone to think I am trying to scam them or make money off of them. I just really like the product and was wanting to help out other Mac streamers who may have felt as frustrated as I have trying to stream.",1,1585094112,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fog4zx/the_game_capture_card_that_works_with_mac/,Twitch,1

fofodu,KittensAndEther,Fundraising with Twitch?,"Hello!

As a preface, I don't know if this is the correct subreddit for this question, in which case any direction would be greatly appreciated. I looked and I don't think this is breaking any rules, and I apologize if I missed something.

I am a trivia host for a very small brewery in a rural Colorado town. We have a relatively large population of homeless people that, especially in the current circumstances, have difficulty finding food. My aim is to host a casted trivia game that will be able to accept donations throughout the span, then sending the donations to a non profit food bank in town.

A friend of mine had suggested using twitch for this. At a glance, it sounds like a great idea- I would be able to cast the powerpoint on my screen, and have my face in the corner acting as a remote host. I have no experience with Twitch, but I can figure out any programs I need to use, providing I know what they are. 

Herein lies my question(s):

1. Is this feasible, and if so what do I need to do to make the broadcasting happen?
2. Does anyone know a way that I could have answers submitted to me affiliated with a team name, and without having the answers visible to other teams?
3. Are there legal ramifications of this that I may be overlooking? We will only ask for donations while happening, and there will be no charge to play.

Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",4,1585092503,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fofodu/fundraising_with_twitch/,Twitch,1

&amp;#x200B;

This thing is amazing. I have been looking for a good Game capture card that works with mac for a long time. I got an elgato and that was a bust, then I almost bought a black magic, but I read a lot of bad reviews for it.  I finally found this capture card and I love it. I have a 2015 mac book air and I haven't had any issues. The one problem I have had, with my slower mac I can only stream or record 720, but that is a problem with my computer not the capture card. But with a more powerful mac you should be able to stream 1080 and maybe even 4k with no problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

The box includes 

The Capture Card

HDMI Cable

USC C to USB 3.0

Adapters to connect and stream footage/gameplay from your phone (No thunderbolt)

A free software (Which I have not tried yet)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is able to help you guys. I know how hard it can be wanting to get into to streaming and just feeling like there aren't any good options for Mac users. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to see actual footage captured from this capture card you can check out my channel here. I have several videos with recorded footage off the Xbox and Nintendo switch.

fo80wo,downvoted_your_mom,Why are streams from my PS4 much smoother than when I stream PC game capture?,"So I've been streaming for a while now but I've always streamed from my PS4 through an Elgato (now through AverMedia 4k capture cared) but now I'm making the transition to PC gaming and streaming it. From what I heard you have to have a pretty decent rig to stream PC games, so I upgraded my PC CPU to an 8-core processor to accommodate for the extra load while streaming (my PC build will be at the bottom of this post). 

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I look at my past twitch streams and I compare my PS4 streams to my PC gaming ones, the PS4 stream looks so much smoother. Why is this and what am I doing wrong? You can see the comparison on my past twitch broadcasts here:

OBS game capture (PC):

[https://clips.twitch.tv/BlueHedonisticLemurHeyGirl](https://clips.twitch.tv/BlueHedonisticLemurHeyGirl)

OBS display/desktop capture (PC):

[https://clips.twitch.tv/FrailSoftMagpieSmoocherZ](https://clips.twitch.tv/FrailSoftMagpieSmoocherZ)

OBS video capture device (Avermedia 4k/ PS4):

[https://clips.twitch.tv/KindObeseRamenSeemsGood](https://clips.twitch.tv/KindObeseRamenSeemsGood)

&amp;#x200B;

You can see the difference in quality, although the game capture is meant for games, it's the worst quality. Although the display capture is good, I'd like it to be as smooth as my PS4 capture. I've tried a bunch of stuff and followed tutorials for the best PC setups and increased my bitrate and cpu usage for higher quality streaming and I still can't get my PC gaming stream to be as smooth as when I capture my PS4. 

Here are my OBS settings if anyone's curious:

[https://imgur.com/a/Iik7MUW](https://imgur.com/a/Iik7MUW)

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone help me get my PC gaming stream to be smoother? I'd honestly appreciate it so much! Mind you, this is not a huge deal I'm sure to a lot of ppl, I just like high quality viewing for my viewers and want it with a similar quality to my PS4 streams!

So I thought why dont streamers encourage their viewers to stream snipe them so they can help out by dropping them insane loot and shit like that every game and give them a huge unfair advantage? Since game companies dont do anything about stream sniping and dont care if a streamer gets killed by a stream sniper every second game, surely their viewers dropping them free loot during the game would grab the game companies attention and would eventually do something about stream sniping? I mean it's not cheating since stream sniping to actually kill streamers isnt considered cheating by Epic games and Call of Duty or other companies?",4,1585063310,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fo6uxj/stream_sniping_suggestion/,Twitch,1

I typically stream 20XX on Tuesdays, so this day isn't a problem. But for the remaining days, unless I want to *constantly* rework the tab, there doesn't really seem to be a valid category. Sometimes, I may not even know what I'm able to get going in time for the stream, either due to a new release, or download times, etc. I don't want to put something like ""Just Chatting"", as this seems very misleading to someone tuning in who wants to see what they can expect.

fo5r6t,ThreadOverflow,Streaming setup for Mac (Audio),"After updating to OS X Catalina over the weekend I found that my much loved Saffire 6 USB is no longer supported. This unit was excellent because I occasionally record songs too so it had a sort of dual purpose (which means I could justify the cost). As a result I figured it was time to take the plunge for something like the GoXLR but there's one problem - not Mac compatible.

I've searched around for a few alternatives and saw Voicemeeter with a MIDI controller (faders and pads) might replicate a lot of the functionality of GoXLR but again - not Mac compatible. I'm sort of at a loss here as a result and can't record audio in my normal way as a result. I have a Mackie ProFX12v2 which I can use to record audio input, but it doesn't let me change audio levels on the fly of different apps like the GoXLR does, even with software.

My question is: how can I replicate the GoXLR functionality with MacOS? Is there such a device out there? I had a look at the Rodecaster by RØDE but it doesn't \*quite\* do what I'd be after (ability to control volume of different apps/services via faders and split the audio). Also it costs a fair whack so could be a costly trial. Any help or tips are appreciated!

fo4j9f,Jayc3,"If you're trying to make Twitch a career, consider this..","I emailed Twitch and had them remove affiliation from my account last week. In all honesty, the reason why I did it is because I wanted to make it as a streamer, but I felt like my approach from the beginning was terrible. A lot of hopeful people out there are pursuing this goal but they more than likely have the wrong idea of what they should/shouldn't be doing.

A good example can be shown from watching any of Devin Nash's youtube videos. You stream everyday, so what? Are you making content for other social medias to expand your growth? How about a youtube channel? Do you know how to make a thumbnail? What editing software are you using? These are some very small things I wish I took time to learn before jumping into the streaming world. I wasted potentially months of time where I could have been teaching myself these things and growing a larger audience through the use of different medias.

Honestly, it's almost impossible to grow your brand by streaming alone. Especially if you're 1 of the thousands streaming the overly saturated games on the market right now. So I removed my affiliation to instead stream on Twitch, youtube and facebook at the same time using restream. I've even upped my thumbnails on youtube and came to a pretty good understanding of how to use sony vegas.

Anyways, if you're one of the millions of people out there who want to 'make it', don't make the same mistake as myself and others. Familiarise yourself on how to create content outside of streaming and expand your social media exposure by using different platforms!!",1,1585054054,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fo4j9f/if_youre_trying_to_make_twitch_a_career_consider/,Twitch,1

I have been streaming for about 2 months now, and overall I feel like I have made a good amount of quality progress. However, my cam quality seems to drop a bit during intense gameplay. I understand generally how bitrate works, and currently mine is at 6000. Here are my specs and a link to my most recent vod.

1080P 60FPS

6000 Bit Rate

x264 Encoding (so far it seems to be better than the AMD encoder)

Upload: 10 Megs

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 1600

GPU: AMD Radeon RX 580 Nitro Special Edition

16GB Ram

SSD

Logitech Brio Cam

Lightning is done in the room

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have been streaming God of War from my PS4 Remote Play (dont own a capture card)

regardless of the PS4 or other games with lots of stuff on the screen like Path of Exile, when im still everything looks good, and when there is lots of action everything drops.

I have tried streaming at 720P,864, and 900 however I dont get any better results. The low movement just looks better at 1080.

Is it maybe my CPU? Thank you sooooo much!

I still have access to my account via my PC. But on my phone, new laptop, etc, I need to verify it's me by entering a code which has been send to my old email. So once I lose access via my pc, I am lost.

I've send all my personal details they wanted. Even creditcard information they requested regarding last payments etc. but not even a reply. I understand if they'd want to have more information or details, but they don't even reply.

 I currently have a pretty decked out pc, el gato HD60s+ capture card and a 2K Asus Monitor. 

What additional tools would I need to hook up a console like n64, GameCube, etc. Streams would probably consist of those two consoles primarily and probably some original Xbox as well",1,1585030432,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fo06ks/classic_consoles_on_twitch/,Twitch,1

fnzmbs,StorminWolf,Any Irish based streamers interested in building a network for support and cross promotion of channels?,"Hi fair people of r/twitch, 


I just started streaming and will als start a YouTube channel in the near future. I have currently much more time than I used to, and need to do something, as I always had photography and video making as a hobby, and I currently build and paint a lot of miniatures etc, I combined those and have started to stream those efforts very recently. (Yesterday as of this post).

It helps coping with isolation and boredom.

I’ve seen this in several other communities of creative streamers, so I thought why not check if there is already something from Ireland, or if there is not ( I was unable to find anything), why not start something like this myself?

I come from an It background with technical experience and worked a lot with and in marketing and customer success, and I’d be happy to build up something while I’m home bound and looking for a new job.

So would anyone be interested?

Kind regards

fnxuz5,Spaniard4788,NOOB: Extensions Question - Any guidance is appreciated!,"I recently started streaming as a way to pass the time.

To increase the quality of my streams I thought I’d look into overlays, and sadly found out the hard way, I have a lot of other things to set up before I’m ready to stream from my Mac using OBS. 😂 

However, today I came across an extension in Twitch called “Overlay Expert” that claimed to insert an overlay without the need for OBS. So I spent the last hour and a half learning the “software” and building my layout. I’m actually pretty proud based on how limited the options were. But for the life of me I cant seem to get it to show up on stream. Does anyone have any experience with this “Overlay Expert” extension? Are there other similar extensions you’d recommended I look into? I’m a an über noob to this so any help, assistance, or guidance is appreciated! Thanks everyone. Happy streaming!

But, it's not evolving fast enough.  
Now that we're locked in because of this virus nonsense, I'm quite sure this is the best possible time ever, for Twitch because every single channel on there is going to blow up now. It's all the excuse in the world to sit at home and watch stuff/stream stuff.

I watch lots of streaming tips channels, join discord, talk to people and try to get all the ideas I can to make my own stream more interesting, more engaging.

So I thought I'd come here and post my channel link and see if I can get more direct advice from people who are nice enough to watch my stream, maybe tell me if I'm doing something wrong, or right, or how I could improve things, etc.

If there's somewhere else I could ask please let me know.

I'm trying to make it so that my wife and I can use my one computer to chat on discord. My current setup is a set of headphones and a modmic that I plug in via a usb sound card (the antlion soundcard that combines my headphone and mic aux plugs into a usb). For my wife I want to use a bluetooth headset with a built in mic. I can get both of these to work individually, but I'm not sure how to get both mics going to discord, and how to get discords audio going to both sets of headphones.

From what I've looked into, it seems like I need to combine the two mic input streams into a single audio stream I can point discord to. At the same time I need something that can create an output audio stream to point discord to, that then splits it to two streams that I can point my headphones to. I've seen a couple half-guides saying to use Virtual Audio Cable, or VoiceMeter, or VoiceMeter Banana, but none of them seem to be exactly what I'm going for, or assumed more knowledge on my end than I have to follow.

That said since she is just dabbling she needs the lowest cost way to do it possible. I'm the more tech savvy of us but I know nothing about streaming, I work in app development lol.

What I need here is advice on equipment and software to recommend to her to get started. I think she would want to stream with a webcam as well. Are there particular specs to look at in a webcam?

Trying to get something to work and seeing if I'm going about this right and where to go from here.

I have four of us streaming from separate houses (different networks) and want them all to stream to a rmtp server I set up at my house. 

I want to be able to switch camera angles between us during our game play from each source. 

I currently have the rmtp working but can only stream to it locally while on the same network. Not sure how to make it public so they can stream to it as well.

TL:DR

\- 4 remote pc's streaming on different networks

\- want to stream them to my rmtp server and use them as sources to switch between in obs

\-currently can only stream locally, how do I make it accessible to other networks to stream to?

fnn5tb,DonutFuel,Improve Chat Experience?,"Hey all,

I've been watching quite a few streams thanks to all of this coronavirus stuff happening, and lately I've been thinking how could the chat experience be improved? As I'm sure most of you know, when a streamer gets popular, their chat can become impossible to read. I know Twitch has provided options like subs-only chat, slow-mode chat, etc. but even then it can still be pretty hard to follow. And slow-mode can be frustrating as a viewer if you want to participate in the chat.

Do you think this is something that only Twitch has the power to improve, or could we help? I was thinking if someone could build a Twitch Extension that could focus on messages picked out by moderators? Or at least provides a filter that the streamer can set, for example if the message only contains emoji, do not show. Or if it looks like spam like 'ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg' then filter that out. I'm sure even then it will still be hard to follow though.

Another idea would be to turn some of the interaction between the viewers and the streamer into some kind of live poll/survey? So if the streamer wants to ask a question, they can submit it to the extension, and viewers can respond through the extension. Cleans up the chat a bit, and viewers can feel like they're participating. (I know Twitch has a category for this, but not sure as to the quality of these extensions? https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/categories/51aa177b-797d-42bb-a8bc-b547551a650a)

Curious to see what all of you think, are we, both viewers and streamers, doomed to a black hole of a chat, or could we make it more accessible for everyone?

fnjz73,FarsideSC,I'd like to do a charity stream for my brother-- where to start?,"Background: My brother tested for COVID 19 and 8 days after testing, he finally got the result back that he was positive for it. He's a contractor in the music industry. As you'd imagine, he's without work for quite some time now. What makes matters worse is that he has a 8 month old kid.

I know there's government assistance and all that, which he's looking into utilizing (the state health department said they'd contact him at some point). However, I'd like to do something a little bit more direct. I was hoping to raise some money to help him, and possibly other people in the Nashville area who are locked down due to the city's shutdown for the next two weeks, or have been diagnosed with COVID.

Plan: I'm not an incredibly talented streamer, by any stretch, but I figured I could take my evenings to stream me playing through the Dark Souls series or maybe even broadcast some coding. That's the idea anyhow. I am looking to set up a GoFundMe to link in the stream that people, should they feel inclined, could donate to.

Problem: How do I market the charity without sounding ridiculous, out of touch, and/or grifting? There's a lot of streams out there that are already established, and I don't have an established userbase. It seems like streaming may be the best avenue to encourage donations, but I don't know how to generate a social media presence when advertising the stream.",3,1584970184,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fnjz73/id_like_to_do_a_charity_stream_for_my_brother/,Twitch,1

fnj5cy,Mooha182,Twitch Viewership analytics discussion,"Please keep this to constructive posts only. I have noticed the following since Feb 2020:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Total numbers of 'viewers watching X' as indicated in X game's directory is 5 to 15%+ higher than every streamer's concurrent viewers listed from all languages. 
2. Constantly higher number of chatters in channel than indicated concurrent viewership. Tracked using a offline snapshot and tracked offline vs on-stream chatters. I know this does not indicate actual viewers but there is now seems to be 5 to 15% more chatters than viewers
3. High amounts of concurrent viewership fluctuations in certain game directories. There seems to be a 5 to 15%+ 'drop' every 30min to 1hr that is either immediately recovered during next refresh of the viewers counter or not recovered. No losses in chatter numbers. May be tied to directories where twitch drops have in the past or are currently enabled.
4. Miss-match between third party average viewership trackers; dashboard has on some days matched third party tools. Other days, it is off by anywhere by 1 to 15%. Typically dashboard under-reports all events. 
5. Average viewer count 'dips' before going increasing by average of 5 or more viewers. IE 15 to 10, to 20, 17 to 23, then 24 to 29 etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Has anyone recently seen these issues on their stream? With corona virus restrictions I am actually somehow seeing less viewership overall despite a more active stream with slightly higher numbers. 
2. Please discuss if you found any methods to mitigate the above problems or if you have noticed any other problems recently.",4,1584966592,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fnj5cy/twitch_viewership_analytics_discussion/,Twitch,1

Recently due to all of the coronavirus stuff I have a lot more free time on my hands. So, I've taken up editing as a hobby, and I really enjoy it. I suck at it, but I enjoy it. At this point, I download my own VOD's and cut them down into what I want to be seen and this works but in a very rudimentary way. I stream at 1280x720 and this has always been okay for the stream, but when I go into VOD's to try and cut clips from it the quality is very poor when zoomed in. Of course, this is because my output on Streamlabs OBS is 1280x720, but if I try to go above that resolution, say, to 1920x1080 (my base resolution), I drop frames heavily streamside, (around 50% lost frames). For a bit more information, I currently stream at 3600 bitrate on Software x264 encoder settings and at a veryfast encoder preset if that narrows any problems down.

In short, I am trying to find a way to funnel the best quality VOD's out of my stream, at the same time maximizing the live stream resolution. I've heard that it is possible to record and stream at the same time, which is what some YouTubers do, but is that very demanding on the computer?

My specs:

GPU - GTX 2070  
CPU - Intel Core i7-6700k  
RAM - 32.0 GB DDR4  
MOBO - Asus Z170-E  
SYS - Windows 10 Home

More information: currently trying this VOD editing stuff with Warzone, which I've found to be pretty demanding of a game CPU wise.

If you need any more information about my specs or streamlabs settings please ask, as I would love to hear if anybody knows of a fix, as I desperately seek high quality in both the live stream and VOD. Thank you a lot for reading this far.",7,1584941528,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fneo6s/recording_streaming_at_the_same_time_how/,Twitch,1

Made a post the other day about how my internet and computer should easily be able to handle streaming at a decent quality;

fne199,Ganonderp420,ISP consistently continues to throttle my Upload for past eight years. Does a VPN help?,"Alright so, I have not used a VPN before but I wanted to know if it could help with my problem.

I live in Illinois and I have WideOpenWest (WOWWAY) as my service provider. As of last year, we pay for 100 Mbps Down/10 Mbps Up, so I have way more than enough Upload than I use for streaming (I typically do 3k Bit Rate.)

For the past eight years, I've dealt with the struggle of not being able to constantly stream and build a following because they insist on making sure I get full download speeds, but never get any where close to the Upload we pay for. Every time we call a Technician out they either BS us, or manage to get the problem fixed for a couple of weeks or so before our Upload goes to crap again.

Testmy.net has been giving me results for the past month showing that i'm not even getting 1 Mbps of Upload, and I still continue to drop frames even after dropping my Bit Rate to 500. For the hell of it even though it's a very inaccurate site, I checked Speedtest.net and sure enough, it even registers i'm not getting what i'm paying for. 

I'm getting sick of dealing with this crap on a daily basis and trying to go back-and-forth with Customer Support trying to get this fixed and unfortunately where I live, we only have access to one ISP: them.

I've tried looking around on Google about VPNs when it comes to Internet Speeds with them saying it slows down connections, but when people complain about the slower speeds or say their speeds got better, they clearly don't have gaming in mind because the Articles only ever mention Download.

Can a VPN actually help fix my Upload speeds, or am I basically stuck with my ISP shafting me regardless of if I use a VPN or not?",4,1584938288,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fne199/isp_consistently_continues_to_throttle_my_upload/,Twitch,1

fnbc9v,zears24,Rodecaster Pro set up with SLOBS Question,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Ive recently bought a Rodecaster pro for a upcoming podcast im planning.

I also stream on twitch through SLOBS and have been trying to set up the Rodecaster to use for the stream to have separate physical controls for my Mic, Music, in game sound and discord. 

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to get it so that my XLR mic is on the 1st mic channel and can run my spotify from my phone through either the phone or blue tooth channel and i did have all the PC sound (discord and any in game or website sound) through the USB channel (not optimal but i dont think i can split thses into different channels for the roadcaster) with my headphones plugged into the front headphone jack. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was working fine until i unplugged my headphones from the front of the rodecaster ( they were not giving me in game sound in the right way so i couldn't hear direction of footsteps in game. so i had to plug the headphones back into the PC seperatly).

&amp;#x200B;

Since unpluging the headphones (even if i plug them back in) i cant get the PC sound to come in through the usb again.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my 3 questions are... 

1. How do i get this sound from PC back into the USB and into the main mix. 
2. Then how do i / can i  then feed that main mix back to the pc and through my headphones?
3. If i can do number 2 can i / how do i do it minus the mic so i dont hear myself but the stream can still hear everything?

Anyway i know thats a big post for a very specific issue that most people haven't had to deal with, but any help would be awesome.

I was thinking about buying a gopro, attaching it to my body, and walking to different places for the whole day. I want to basically be the people who are stuck at home everyday's eyes, their VR. To walk around the city or the surrounding nature. From 7:00am to 10:00pm straight. Streaming and recording it to Twitch and Youtube. Doing everyday things that people may not be able to do anymore since they are either sick or quarantined in their homes. This would make me very happy as well to do for them.

Yep, I'm just another Flat Cap wearing, bald dude with a slight beard because I have a weak chin lol. 

So really, I'm just looking for a bit of community feedback. I'm actually OK with how I look etc, I was never going to be a model. My biggest concern is that I'm worried that I will just never be entertaining enough for streaming. I'm usually pretty quiet and sit back in social situations, and I'm more than happy for an Alpha type to take the lead and be the amusing one. This is great for IRL occasions but doesn't work so well for streaming. I'm not sure that I will ever get over the \*staring at the screen blankly\* that I'm conditioned to do after 25-30 years of gaming. 

The most entertaining people I can think of on Twitch are all pretty energetic and witty so I'm not sure that I fit the mould. I really enjoy it as a hobby, and I have met some really lovely streamers, viewers and gamers while doing it. I just worry that I'll spend all of my free time trying to make a thing of it and will regret it in the future.

fn3m8s,bbreadmanTTV,How do I make my Twitch VOD's look better?,"Hello!

My name is bbreadman and recently due to all of the coronavirus stuff I have a lot more free time on my hands. So, I've taken up editing as a hobby, and I really enjoy it. I suck at it, but I enjoy it. At this point, I download my own VOD's and cut them down into what I want to be seen and this works but in a very rudimentary way. I stream at 1280x720 and this has always been okay for the stream, but when I go into VOD's to try and cut clips from it the quality is very poor when zoomed in. Of course, this is because my output on Streamlabs OBS is 1280x720, but if I try to go above that resolution, say, to 1920x1080 (my base resolution), I drop frames heavily streamside, (around 50% lost frames). For a bit more information, I currently stream at 3600 bitrate on Software x264 encoder settings and at a veryfast encoder preset if that narrows any problems down.

In short, I am trying to find a way to funnel the best quality VOD's out of my stream, at the same time maximizing the live stream resolution. I've heard that it is possible to record and stream at the same time, which is what some YouTubers do, but is that very demanding on the computer?

My specs:

GPU - GTX 2070  
CPU - Intel Core i7-6700k  
RAM - 32.0 GB DDR4  
MOBO - Asus Z170-E  
SYS - Windows 10 Home

More information: currently trying this VOD editing stuff with Warzone, which I've found to be pretty demanding of a game CPU wise.

If you need any more information about my specs or streamlabs settings please ask, as I would love to hear if anybody knows of a fix, as I desperately seek high quality in both the live stream and VOD. Thank you a lot for reading this far.

fmtu32,aaronchall,Twitch hiding my channel - Is it a Bug or a Feature?,"Since I am no longer employed where I need to ask my boss's permission to engage the public, I've been streaming for up to 8 hours a day or more for the past 10 days. I took a small break Thursday and only streamed a couple of hours Thursday evening. Basically I'm trying to get a lot of experience, fast.

I'm a programmer and corporate Python trainer, and I want to build a community around the areas I have expertise and interests in.

At the suggestion of a couple of people who have helped me with my stream, I contacted support, which after a followup contact on the issue, replied:

&gt;Your account may have been incorrectly positioned in the directory. When an event like this occurs, it is typically **only temporary**. \[...\] please retry at a later time and it should be resolved.

From what I can tell, this isn't intermittent - this is persistently the case that I'm hidden from active streams in my category, and beyond that, you can't even find me by my specific handle in search.

I'm a programmer. I know that sometimes the way things work can be characterized as a bug - or it can be characterized as a feature. Maybe it's a feature not to show new channels too much - maybe just show them to a few users, for a few minutes near the start of the stream, so they get experience and have a small chance to be really engaging, and then go away and think about how they can improve their stream. 

But the problem is that Twitch seems to want my expectations to be that I should be showing up in the list of live streams, and I'm not. Is it the wrong expectation for them to give me? It would be totally fair if they're saying, ""we've got rules-of-thumb for showing browsable channels, and you're just not meeting them yet."" But instead they're telling me it's just a bug. And I get the sense that's not the whole story.

My question: is this a feature or a bug? What are other people's experience with this? Anyone ever dive in like I have? If so, what was your experience like?",1,1584850696,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fmtu32/twitch_hiding_my_channel_is_it_a_bug_or_a_feature/,Twitch,1

fms7m9,AgentxN,I need advice o/,"Alright so basically, I started to stream on twitch somewhat around 4 years ago. At first, I was very inconsistent so I will say I started to stream seriously 2 years into twitch. But I have been streaming 2-3 times a week from 2018 up until 2019- September.   
Since then I have streamed almost every single day for roughly 3+ hours on popular games such as Fortnite, GTA, COD:MW and rainbow six.   


I reached an average of 3 viewers for affiliate but all of a sudden I now have next to no viewers. I invested 3.5k into a setup after affiliate as I thought I was starting to grow. I now have great quality streams and stable fps. I interact with everyone that talks in the chat at around a 3-8 second delay. I also have a discord server for a community and schedule. I am dedicated to this and mainly do it for a hobby just wanting to grow.

fmqe6o,brock_goins,What’s Changed?,"Hi, I don’t know how to start this without saying the cliche “why am I not getting any viewers?” But here it goes. 

During last august-November I was streaming kind of consistently like 2-3 times a week maybe like 1 hour at a time. Which is atrocious. I was busy with college and stuff. I would get a decent 2-4 viewers per stream with around 6-10 unique viewers per. I peaked at 6 viewers. This was one of my happiest moments lmao. 

Extended break between then and a month or so ago

Here we are streaming 2-5 hours at a time on a decent schedule at the same times of the day, now I barely get any viewers other than myself(I only have one monitor so I use a laptop to manage.) and my friends. I’ve yet to have a single person speak in my chat other than my friends and the max amount of unique viewers I’ve gotten in around 30 or so streams since I started back was 2. I generally had good viewer retention when I streamed last year. Now it just seems like it’s all gone to shit. 

I know the typical, “keep going man you’ll get there,” and the “don’t worry about viewers bro just keep streaming and putting content out.” I was doing that previously and it was working. It feels like my channel has been blacklisted to everyone but 1% of twitch viewers. I know it shouldn’t be easy, but it shouldn’t be this ridiculously difficult compared to the tiny amount of success I had just a few months prior. 

I feel like the approach I’ve taken to streaming this time around is so much better than how it was before. Now I feel like I’m a better streamer getting the viewers I deserved months ago.",5,1584836813,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fmqe6o/whats_changed/,Twitch,1

fmq0v2,eddygCPA,I always see people seeking advice so thought I would chime in for making affiliate. What’s your best advice?,"The biggest tips for people looking to get affiliated: 

1. You need to think about your branding. Sit down for a 30 minutes and think about why people should come to your channel? Are you really good at the game? Are you hella funny? If so, then market yourself as that. Show us some clips of you killing a whole squad or a clip of something hilarious you said so that we as an audience know that’s the value we get going to your channel.

2. Use social media/YouTube/reddit to grow. I streamed for like 30 days straight and realized I wasn’t getting anyone to my channel. From Jan to March I grew about 400 followers on twitch by reaching out to anyone who followed me on social media. I start conversations with people. It’s like sales. You gotta reach out to people. Some people will respond, some people won’t. The people that do you should have genuine conversation with! Ask them how they’re enjoying the latest season, who their favorite character is etc.

3. Everyone starts at 0. Don’t beg people to come to your channel. Twitch is all about interaction, it is the beauty of the platform. So in that sense, make interactive content. Use forums like these not just as a “here’s my clip come watch me” but more of like “hey here’s my clip it’s gonna make you laugh and hopefully you will stop by even if it’s for a second.” Talk to people, make people’s lives better with your content. 

Hope this helps anyone! Just tired of seeing stats and people saying “help me get affiliate”",1,1584835387,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fmq0v2/i_always_see_people_seeking_advice_so_thought_i/,Twitch,1

2. I’m  VERY new to PC gaming. I’m looking for some people to game with. My  favorites are Stardew Valley and Elder Scrolls Online. I’m up to play  anything to be honest, I just need some people to play with.
3. The  last reason is I am going to start a stream on Twitch. I would love to  have as much support as possible. My goal is to stream some of my  favorite games, and some games my viewers suggest.  I would really like  it if I could some people to play with me while I stream, to make it  more interesting and fun for everyone.

So, if you want to chill with me and play some games please add me on Steam: PaintedxLady

I’ve never attempted.,"Just as the title says. I think I have to go into self isolation soon and the thought is depressing, as I recently started a new job that’s been very fulfilling for me so far. I’d like to potentially stream/donate any tips to charity to help myself feel a little more productive. I don’t have an ideal setup, is the only thing. I currently have two laptops, the beefier one for gaming is a Gigabyte laptop with these specs:

2.8-3.8 ghz Intel Core i7-7700HQ
Nvidia GTX 1060
16GB DDR4 RAM
1TB HDD + 128GB SSD

I also have an old MacBook that may or may not help with processing/encoding depending on how that’s possible? Here are the specs:

OS X El Capitan 10.11.6
2.7 ghz intel core i7
16 gb 1333 MHz ddr3
Intel HD graphics 3000 512 mb

Is it feasible to create some kind of setup in my house where I game on the Gigabyte laptop and somehow offload some of the processing to the MacBook for streaming? How would I go about this? I also have an Elgato HD (not the HD60, just the HD), which I’ve only ever used for capture. I’m not sure if that would help?

Catch me live streaming simple stretching exercises and freestyle yoga flows!,"I've been stuck at home and self isolating for the past 6 days, often spending hours on Kerbal Space Program. We've all been there- irritable, tense, and feeling stiff after playing for hours. Take a moment to tune to my [(bodhi\_blonde)](https://www.twitch.tv/bodhi_blonde/) live streams to follow a breathing exercise, a stretch, or just to have something distracting on in the background while you play.

I am still very new to Twitch (and using a MacBook Air for streams for now) so any and all advice would be much appreciated! I haven't had anyone watch my stream yet so I'm not sure if my audio/video is up to quality. 

And finally, what kind of small daily changes would you want to see? A daily mantra? Focus on a different pose each day? A different outfit?

fmlo2p,ACBorgia,How do I make people interact in chat?,"I've been streaming for 6 months and I'm still a very little streamer with an average of 3 viewers, I often have people come by in chat since I talk a lot, but they often seem to leave pretty fast

I tried different things like trying to make them interact with what I'm doing (for example a poll about what I should do in game), ask them questions about what they like, telling stories, talking about other games, talking about the music/the artist (I have songrequest on)

Despite all that they start lurking or quit the stream pretty fast, usually in around 5 to 10 minutes

I'm thinking maybe I give too much attention to my viewers and they don't like it, but as a viewer myself I never felt like receiving a lot of attention from the streamer would make me leave so I'm really not sure what's the problem

fmkunv,TeddyBurrYT,Streamlabs Mobile Streaming Setup,"I recently seen someone on Twitch playing Pokemon Go (which is played in portrait mode) and both sides were filled in. It was a simple but nice looking setup; the only additional widget; I seen was a tip jar.  They were using 'StreamLabs' mobile and I asked if they were mirroring from their PC. They went on to explain that they were not and the setup was made on PC using streamlabs and then once they opened Streamlabs Mobile the overlay was available there. I was able to get an image for a basic overlay; however, once trying to put the camera into place on the layers, it would not work properly; no matter how many times I tried it on different layers, I was still unsuccessful.  

1. Is there a more simple way to do this?
2. Is it possible to use the same method on YouTube mobile?

Id probably stream live on Twitch then edit together everything into a 20Minute youtube special! I wanted to gather a few people from various platforms to be in the video while i stream and they’ll obvs appear in the final youtube video

For context, I'm mainly a FPS/BR player. I've done some basic branding with a simple logo I made myself, but no financial or time commitment into the name yet.

I checked my net on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net);

94 Mbps up

13 Mbps down

x264

3500 bitrate

720p30fps

bicubic downscale

problem is, I'm getting at least 50% frame drops with these settings, and with NVENC up to 60% with the same bitrate and res. I have no idea why I'm getting such bad frame drops since apparently I should be fine to handle the streaming, especially since I'm only streaming CSGO and Overwatch.

I always think: come for the game, stay for the personality.However, even with streamers I like, I don’t even check in when I’m not interested in what they’re playing. Which I feel means I’m not entirely engaged in their community. I’m a lurker vagrant I suppose.

For those of you who are active community members for a twitch streamer how did you get into their community? What made you stick around? And how often do you watch/donate to their stream?

I made Twitch partner this year after just one year of streaming and I wanted to share some of my advice on streaming. There are lots of challenges and decisions to be made, so make sure you really think about them before you start streaming or as you go along.

If you have any questions or comments, please leave them and I will reply as soon as I can. I will try to focus on giving some quality first hand advice this year, especially since so many people are left at home and just starting out streaming. Best of luck (and health) to you all!

&amp;#x200B;

**^(EASIER)**

^(Sticking to one game) 

^(Playing unsaturated games) 

^(Clothing (or lack thereof) attracts attention (Cosplay, cleavage, costumes, suits…))

^(Having someone who supports you)

^(Have a social media following)

^(Great social skills (extrovert))

^(Money to start with)

^(Great editing skills)

^(Great gaming skills)

&amp;#x200B;

**^(HARDER)**

^(Variety streaming) 

^(Playing saturated games) 

^(Your clothing doesn’t attract attention)

^(Having to support yourself/little support from others)

^(Have zero social media following (relying on great content   instead – being entertaining, great gaming skills, able to interact with  viewers))

^(Have little social skills (introvert)) 

^(Have little money)

^(Still learning to edit)

^(Bad gaming skills)

• Variety streaming vs. playing one game only. Don’t get me wrong, you want to be playing games you enjoy playing. That’s the number one rule of streaming. However, I have noticed variety streamers with no advantages such as a huge social media following or starting money, struggle to find viewers, especially if it’s between game genres. You can still definitely make it on Twitch, your growth just might be slower. On the other hand these streamers have viewers who are there for the streamer and not the game. So on one hand – faithful viewers who love you for who you are, on the other – high viewership numbers and getting closer to partner. Explore different games. Is there one that definitely stands out in terms of viewership? Do new people come to the stream every time you play that game? Do you enjoy that game? Do you see yourself playing that game for months on end? The key is finding that balance.

• And this brings us to – playing unsaturated games vs. saturated games. It depends what kind of game you play, so if you’re hacking away at League of Legends for a year, it still might be difficult to grow. I found that sticking to popular indie games is a great start to get viewers, just as long as you don’t get bored by the game. By popular I mean that the category shouldn’t have more than ten to fifteen streamers, but still has around a hundred thousand followers or more.

• Some streamers decide to give themselves an extra advantage by dressing in a certain way that attracts more attention. If you’re like me and wear mostly just T-shirts, it will make you blend in more, which means you have to put extra effort into your content.

• Having someone who financially (and otherwise) supports you is a great advantage if you want to make streaming a full time job. The first months of growing a stream can be financially straining. Whether the person supporting you is your partner, your parents, even a patron, it buys you time and saves energy required to make your stream great. Having a full time job and streaming can be exhausting, so remember to pace yourself. Stream on days off or after work, if you feel up to it. Just stream consistently, so your viewers know where and when to find you. 

• Here’s another pointer everyone is aware of. Social media following can give you a huge leg boost when you decide to stream, even if only a small percentage move over – that 1% of followers on YouTube, Twitter or Instagram can give you 70 or 100 viewers straight away! If you don’t have that following like me when I started out (I still don’t), don’t worry. It just means you will have to rely on your ability to entertain an audience that much more. Whether it’s in the form of great gaming skills, great conversational skills or something else, you have to have it if you want to build a career from streaming.

• Great social skills help A LOT. I don’t mean just to entertain an audience, because that one is self-explanatory. I mean socializing with other streamers. Sometimes you’ll have to go on a hunt for others like you or just streamers you like and other times they will find you. They can throw you a raid or a host, so make sure to thank them and talk to them and their viewers. If you don’t do the searching yourself and just wait for others to throw you a host or a raid, it might take you a lot longer to grow successfully. And don’t forget to raid or host someone who is about equal size to you or smaller to actually stand a chance at striking a friendship. It's nice to get raided, you'll likely get more followers, but don't forget hosts and raids do not affect Partnership and you can't always count of those viewers come back.

• Starting money can play a huge role in your streaming endeavors. Money can buy you an excellent camera, lightning, space, computer, microphone, not to mention other things like your image. If you don’t have unlimited funding to give yourself a leg boost, I suggest starting with decent but cheap equipment. There’s lots of advice on the internet on what equipment to buy on a budget, so make sure you do your research. You can always upgrade as you go along.

• If you’re great at editing videos, making sound effects, creating your scenes for the stream, it can really lift your stream from average to entertaining. If you don’t have these skills, then all of the entertainment comes from YOU, the streamer.

• If you know you're really good at a certain game or you know a game very well, try to take advantage of your skills. People love watching a skilled or educational streamer doing what they do best. If your gaming skills don't stand out in any game, try to think of other ways to bring viewers to your stream or make playing bad the entertaining center point of the stream.

Additional Advice

It helps to play games that are known for their difficulty or playing a game on the highest difficulty, especially starting off - it helps you stand out more.

Being patient, consistent, treating streaming like a business are all bonuses, but they don’t guarantee anything. There's always that factor of luck as well.

fm7mup,chloelaura89,Please could I get some capture card advice?,"Hi! I have been streaming a little while now and I’ve decided to buy a capture card to stream my PS4 and Nintendo Switch games. However, this is kind of more complicated than I thought there is so much information on them, and I’m having a hard time understanding what a lot of it means. Right now I have 2 options, Elgato HD60 S and AVerMedia Live Gamer Portable 2 Plus.

I have been reading online to see what would be the best for me but a lot of it is just repeating itself. Obviously I would like as little lag as possible but I heard that if I don’t get the Elgato HD60 S+ there wont be zero lag Pass-Through. The AverMedia has 4K Pass-Through but I am unsure to what that even means.

Out of these 2 capture cards what would be the best? I stream through a gaming laptop (it isn’t bad quality or anything and I never have any issues most of the time). My setup is also a little complained, would I be able to stream and play through my laptop screen or would I need to use the TV for PS4? Sorry for my jumbled questions just I am really not good at technology. I will also be using OBS studio as that is what I’ve been using for the last couple of months. 

When looking at the Elgato HD60 S I seen complaints about audio not matching up and I would have to change my settings etc, what does this mean? I have a Snowball mic and won’t be using my PS4 headset.

The twitch PS4 app gives me error code F65ECA04 when I press the sign in button.

The Link with other services button in the PS4 menu gives me error code CE-35327-0. 

It's been like this for like 8 years and only seems to happen under my PSN username. I don't have the original machine where it worked, it's probably in a dumpster at this point. Also, why is it only my username? Everyone else's works perfectly fine and as designed.

Inside the volumen settings I have output device my headphones stereo and input the headset audio so it should be correct.   
When I try to stream on OBS I can only listen on the headset or have the mic, both will not work simultaneously.   
I have heard that Sony WH 1000X M3 does not pair to multiple devices at the same time or if I just have the settings wrong.   
I try playing changing the settings on desktop audio to ""headphones stereo"" and mic/aux ""headset audio"" but still I can only do one at time.

It just seems like I get ignored despite me actually chatting in people's streams, not just lurking or solely giving bits. Twitch is an amazing community where streamers give and receive love all the time, it just seems like I'm being left out.

I know I'm not the best at socializing, so any advice on how to improve as a chatter? And any advice on establishing a good relationship with other streamers? A relationship that is a two way street.

flxeu6,ZeeDrakon,Someone essentially stole my identity and I just found out.,"Disclaimer at the start: I'm not a streamer, I'm not losing revenue or something over this so essentially it isnt that important, but it's pissing me off right now so please bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I *am* ZeeDrakon. I literally made that name up for myself over 7 years ago now, it's 100% my own creation. If you google that name the results you're getting are my reddit account, my league of legends account and, weirdly as I just found this out testing it, some random articles where people repurpose my reddit comments without my knowledge?

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, that is MY name. I didnt use a character from a book or show or some celebrity or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

On twitch, however, I cant use that name. I did for a long time, but I lost access to the email adress that was connected to my original twitch account so I basically just accepted that I wouldnt be able to use that name and made a new account. So imagine my surprise when I was watching a stream late last night and suddenly see ""ZeeDrakon just subscribed"" popping up in the corner of the screen. ([https://www.twitch.tv/videos/570922907](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/570922907)  00:30:44 for reference). This isnt me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So there's someone running around with my name. I know I dont have IP rights over that name, so I mainly want to contact that person, but I cant find them in the twitch whisper list, is there any other way to contact them or see how old the account is? Or anything else I can do that I havent thought of?",2,1584720002,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/flxeu6/someone_essentially_stole_my_identity_and_i_just/,Twitch,1

* Window Capture
* Screen Capture

In-Game I've tried:

* Full Screen
* Borderless windowed

Whenever I go into the game (Overwatch), the settings go back to the blown-out version. Overexposed and just terrible. No matter what I end up doing, it just seems to lose the settings. Is there a way around this or fix?

We did something very similar last year and there was no problem downloading the vods directly from twitch, they just downloaded as normal no matter the length. But this time I noticed that any of the vods over 6 hours in length just failed to download. So, I uploaded those videos to YouTube straight from twitch and downloaded them from there. However, the closing ceremony video is just over 14 hours long. I can't download it straight from twitch as it just fails, I can't upload it to Youtube as it's too big, (I've tried asking twitch to upload it in 15-minute chunks but it doesn't seem to want to do that either), and I've tried using some free youtube/twitch vod downloaders but none of the ones I've found seem to manage to download it either.

flrkpb,Oddie65,"Heads Up, Webcams are Selling Out","I just checked all over the place because I get paid today and was waiting to get a c922 or c920, and it looks like every major retailer is sold out of the c615, c920, c922, Brio, and even the Razer Kiyo. I was unable to find a single reputable cam locally or on the sites of those stores plus amazon. The few places that have them are selling them way above retail or theyre used and still selling near retail. Just wanted to give others a warning in case they’re in a position like me and were planning on purchasing a webcam to add to their content soon. 

Supposedly the issue is largely because of large companies buying the logitech cams by the pallet and distributing amongst employees who want/need to telecommute to work. What really sucks is most of those cams are going to be used a few times and forgotten, thrown away, or resold for too much because they’re, “like new.” Have a happy Friday everyone and happy streaming!",4,1584693185,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/flrkpb/heads_up_webcams_are_selling_out/,Twitch,1

I really can't afford to lose those benefits because of Twitch. They pay my parents to ensure they can afford to feed and shelter me when I'm out of work, and I'm currently incapable of owning a home myself.

I also own and have access to both a microphone and a webcam, but there are some people online who know my voice and associate it with negative attributes that I had when I was still a young dumb teenager.

I know of a service that could caption what I say in English, and I do want my viewers to speak english in chat...

Could I feasibly start streaming without audio from my mic, without video from my webcam, and without donations? I could definitely still interact with my viewers through captions, there's no doubt about that, I just don't wanna risk my current stability, as it's hard to come by for me and my family. Especially with the coronavirus going around and me no longer going to work, I need that income as much as possible, so I can't take donations.

There's no way there are now fewer people streaming so there's more capacity even for non-affiliates, right? With so many people staying at home I'd imagine there's even more people streaming and/or watching, so did Twitch do something to give more streams transcoding or were we the lucky ones to get it?

flmgie,Erev,Connection suggestions for old consoles?,"Hey folks! After ages of neglect I finally got myself a tv stand for my various game consoles and plan to stream some of the old stuff. Trouble is that I've got seven systems and probably only a single free HDMI port. Making matters worse, of those systems only four are HDMI - two others are composite (N64 and early PS2) and the last can either be composite or component (XBox 360 - first run before they added the HDMI port). I've been looking for some sort of selector switch that can handle this but my luck has been limited. Being gaming equipment, I do worry about lag time due to running it from the console, possibly through a separate converter (N64, PS2, 360), then a selector, then a splitter (to tv and to pc) and then finally to the screen.

Has anyone come up with a good fix for their own console setups? Is the delay from input to screen noticeable? Am I missing something fairly obvious?

flkvdo,Ferromagneticfluid,"This isn't a post complaining about there being ads, but I do have a problem with them","I don't mind watching ads to support the content I watch. Nothing is free in the world, and I don't mind watching ads to support that content. I rarely have problems with ads unless they aren't working correctly.

Which is what I am complaining about here. I have a slow internet connection, one that can barely handle 1080p video if no one else is using the Internet for other things. I like to watch streams at 480p or even 360p. The lower resolution doesn't bother me. It allows me to watch streams with almost no delay (important to me) and allows me latency free play elsewhere online.

What does bother me is when people play ads, the ad tries so hard to force itself into 1080p quality or higher. Even though I have my stream at 480p or lower. It causes the ad to constantly stutter, while trying to load, and that is really annoying to me. Once again, I don't mind watching ads. But I do mind the constant stuttering and attempting to load ads while it tanks anything else I (or others) are doing online. In addition, sometimes the stream will come back from the ad break a full 30s behind real time rather than the usual 2-3 seconds for me.

So if any Twitch employees are reading this, please make ads the same resolution as the stream I am watching. Otherwise I will just go and enable some ad blocking software. This has only been an issue in the last few weeks, but has been an issue in the past.

Oh and if anyone has a work around that doesn't involve an ad block software, I would love to hear it.",47,1584662830,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/flkvdo/this_isnt_a_post_complaining_about_there_being/,Twitch,1

I'm not concerned about saving the video for later viewing so the fact the video might get muted post-live doesn't really concern me. However, I do need to know, will the live stream itself get muted or worse, shut down?

I attempted a test where I played a number of songs - the same that shut my youtube test down - for about twenty minutes and experienced no problems.

We would like to set up a decent little studio for her, and luckily we have a OK Microphone (Blue Snowball) and some sound proofing, unfortunately much of what she is doing is going to be video, and her work chrome book camera is terrible, and I don't have a camera on my desktop rig. 

I am looking for some good recommendations for sub $100 or $200 cameras and streaming software. I have used OBS before, so we will probably just use that for now, but any recommendations would be great. 

We were considering using her iPhone, but I don't think that is the best option. If anyone has any experience with using iPhones for streaming let me know. 

I know that this isn't really 100% Twitch related, but they will be using Twitch for some things while they ramp up other options.

flhsq7,ftb4c,reason for hardlimits?,"So, I had cut this down quite a lot as I got a bit off topic as I wrote it. So, here's the short version:

* 1920 x 1080
* 60 FPS
* 6.000 kBit/s
* viewers can't select their own view quality but are forced to watch what the streams ingests

Are there any technical reasons for these rather low end hard limits? Why I have to be a partner to give my viewers the freedom to select an appropriate quality setting on their own depend on their device / connection speed? Instead, as I'm far away from the requirements, anyone want to watch me is forced to view it as I ingest it: Full HD at 60 FPS with max bitrate (a bit over it as I did correct maths by using 1024 instead of 1000 as the 2nd factor).

Also: Why only just 6.000 kBit/s? For a stable good looking Full HD stream @ 60FPS more than double of it, 12-16 MBit/s, is recommended - when producing good quality even 5-6 times (30-36MBit/s) - at least that's what most high quality YouTube videos are transcoded to. Mixer at least allows me up to 10 MBit/s - but if I go over Twitch max just so slightly (6.144 kBit/s for video using correct maths + 160 kBit/s for high quality audio already end up in about 6.2MBit/s) I instant got a warning for ""unstable"" ingestion - and if you go above 7 MBit/s you often encounter one those 4-digit mis-leading errors suggesting anything wrong at the viewer instead of the stream just using a too high bitrate - to in my eyes: Twitch just doesn't allow high enough ones.

Twitch was bought by Amazon - why not just the idling infrastructur on hot-standby? There're a few not utilized AWS instances? Let us streamers use them - so taking about 50% of the subs is at least somewhat reasonable.",10,1584651849,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/flhsq7/reason_for_hardlimits/,Twitch,1

Ideally we would want 2 cameras, one pointing at a lab bench and the other at a white board. We would need audio for both cameras and would like to seamlessly transition between cameras during the live stream. Does anyone have any recommendations on where to start with this? I'm pretty inexperience with this stuff, I've already watched some YT videos but it seems that they may be a bit outdated with the software. Would OBS studio be ideal for this? Should I get 2 HDMI cameras or just one HDMI camera with a cheap web cam? I would really like to know the equipment and software I'll need to buy.

Our schools are closed down for at least the next month due to coronavirus outbreak, but we are still expected to teach and engage students during that time. My school district has provided very limited information on how to handle the closure since the announcement was so sudden and we were entering Spring Break.

My idea is to stream on twitch (no webcam, just voice) for lectures and reviewing primary source documents (history teacher). Distance learning starts next week. I've got a channel set up with a nightbot so students can enter basic commands to get links. I have a schedule set up that I will share with students once I get started. I've already played around with sample streams so I can see what it looks like.

Some questions I have: 

1.  Am I missing anything major? Open to suggestions.
1.  What would you look for in a teacher's stream, is this something you would even bother watching as a student?
1.  How do I deal with the lag time - roughly 10 seconds - between my actions on my screen vs. when my students will see them and ask questions/interact?",17,1584638774,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fldwfa/schools_are_closed_teacher_needs_help/,Twitch,1

I need a new one) and I don't have the money to buy one. I could possibly buy a PS4 cam but I also want to stream ACNH when it comes out and I don't think the PS4 cam would work for a Nintendo system? It seems like my only option is to get a webcam but how could I even make a webcam work for me without a computer? I'm just very confused about how to set things up for an enjoyable stream that isn't just gameplay.

I was also wondering if I could use my bluetooth headphones I use for working out. It has a mic and it probably wouldn't be as good as a gaming headset, but it could still be plugged in and pick up audio.",3,1584627923,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/flausa/new_to_streaming_and_i_dont_have_a_laptop/,Twitch,1

I'm really fascinated how far AI learning improved the last couple of years. I do wonder if a 'machine learning' stream can be found anywhere? 

A channel that shows how an 'AI' is learning/improving on a video game. So for example streaming live how an AI learns how to play the game ['Beyond Oasis'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Oasis) using curiosity learning.

I want to stream myself playing the game with both a camera on me and the game in the background. I have a budget of $700 right now and I am willing to spend it on a desktop computer. I don't play any other pc games although I might want to stream animal crossing on the switch in the future.

Here are the requirements to run the game on Windows:  
Windows 7 SP2 or later  
4GB RAM; 6GB available HD space

My knowledge of computers is very slim. I'm not entirely sure what the above means except for Windows 7 or later. I tried searching for PCs in this budget on the search bar here but I don't understand a lot of what I'm reading. I just want a couple options for desktop PCs that I can buy altogether without having to build one. I would also use this computer for work and school related things but that really doesn't require much at all. 

Can I just choose any PC around $700 and expect it to work alright? Could I go lower than $700? What are a couple PC examples?",2,1584597039,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fl4wgd/looking_for_an_all_in_one_pc_to_stream_pokemon/,Twitch,1

If it helps anyone here, just know that you’re in charge of your stream and chat! It’s so very easy to time people out or ban them, which for me has been the best method for trolls.

For those who are just ignorant or immature, adding logic to their statements usually shuts it down or they get bored and leave.

At the end of the stream it really just helped my viewer count. Their comments would have bothered me if I was a young teenager again, but it helps a ton if you can be secure in your identity.

My friend and I just started doing a duo stream where we play multiplayer/co-op games about a month ago (just got affiliated!) and we run 2 cams, one from his computer and mine over Skype. We are both using Blue Yetis and the quality of audio for one of us is **much** better than the other's. This is almost definitely because he's recording both my video &amp; audio from Skype, but we can't really think of any better options that include us running a video at the same time, as it would most likely take up too much bandwidth.

We've set up a noise gate and my gain is all the way down, which has helped but it is still wildly different. We were also having trouble properly cropping the discord cam, so I don't think that is an option either. I'm not sure if there is much else we can do at this point.

fktqe4,opendarkwing,PSA: Creators,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to shut down businesses and people are getting laid off, don't be surprised when/if there is a loss in Subs and Bits. 

One of the first things to go when this happens is disposable income. And most Subs and Bits come from others disposable income. 

Please keep something in mind, this is not a reflection on you as a streamer! These are hard times with more coming. Our anxiety will try to tell us that any downtick is our fault. It isn't. 

Also, please don't lash out at your communities if this happens. I understand that for some, streaming is sole income and losses hurt. But, being reliant on others having extra money to spend is a risk we all take. This isn't their fault. 

One way to look at this is that we are crucial to bringing a normalcy and relaxation to people's lives. The world is being overturned right now and being a steady rock to even one person can do wonders.

fksnll,ilostmy4skininnam,Feeling like I'll never live up to my role-models.,"18 days ago today I finally did my first stream. I pretty much grew up with YouTubers, so forthe longest time that has been my dream job, but a while ago it transitioned into streaming, I don't really know why, I still mainly watch YouTube and I overall enjoy it a lot more. That's besides the point though, the point is I finally did it. For someone who has aspired to be a youtuber/streamer for basically all his life, I've never acctually done anything with it. Some laziness, some ignorance and a lot of anxiety about being made fun of etc resulted in me keeping it in the back of my mind and telling myself ""ill do it soon"" without ever doing it. Then I got into either callmecarson on jschlatt, i dont remember which came first, but none the less, smplive happened it was so fucking funny.

I started watching a LOT of the people who played on smplive. Every moment in that server was a joyride, and after a while I decided I wanted to start streaming. Of course I didn't yet, I played around with  the thought for a long ass time before giving myself a kick in the ass, and taking the next step: getting a name.

Of course it took me at least a month before i found a name I could slightly bear to listen to. Another month went by with me customizing my channel as an excuse not to start yet, before I at last, on March 1st 2020 had my first stream. Starting really is the hardest step to take. 

It's been 18 days and I've had three streams and each time it feels like Im improving just slightly, getting to be more confident, more expressive, more comftable etc. But I'm still nowhere near a level I can be proud of. People often say if its not something you would watch, why would other people? And I guess that's the level I'm trying to get to. The level where it is something I would watch. 

I genuinely think the people that motivated me to start streaming in the first place like carson and jschlatt are some of the most funny people I've ever known of, and I have a deep admiration for them, but with how funny they are, I often get caught up in thinking things like, ""can I ever become this funny?"" or even ""ill never be this funny."" etc. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this, other than I've been thinking it a lot recently, and I felt like I should talk to someone about it. Any tips on how to become funnier, motivation, similar stories with happy endings, or even how to stop thinking like this entirely would be super.

Can someone answer this question specifically please - as I've seen threads and video's that allude to answering the question - but then actually don't!  They just answer the username part of the question and not the display name bit.   

I've got a Twitch account which I've been using for nearly a year now and have been paying to subscribe monthly to certain streamers.  However, after thinking about it for a while then I fancy giving streaming a go myself now (my work in television has all been cancelled and I'm also in the high risk category for coronavirus and so looks like I'll be staying inside for a good while, so seems like the best time to give streaming a go at last!).  My current username and display name is my actual real life name - however, for streaming purposes I'd now like to use something that isn't my actual real name.  

I know I can change my username to something else every 60 days but from what I can see then that would leave my display name **STILL** as my old display name - i.e. my real name.  So is there a way that I can change my name to be both a different username **AND** display name as I'd prefer not to create a new account as I wan't to keep up my subscription streaks on the people I subscribe to without having to start again with a new account - or having to switch between 2 accounts.

fknx1j,Massmerize,Custom commands for Slobs/Stream Avatars - Viewers catching Pokémon in Stream Avatars," Dear folks,

I would require your help to set up custom commands for Stream Avatars.

As many other people out there I've added the pokemon stream avatars (gen1 for the time being).  
And i use SLOBS to stream. --&gt; so the question would also be where to set up the commands &amp; variables.

Addtitonal Info: (shiny's to be created by myself, color changed pkmn)  
Everything in here is up to discussion - it's just an idea that i like to see happening.  
I would like to create a smooth running, feedback giving (whispering back every outcome) experience for my viewers.

**Variables:**

Group Pokemon into ""rarity tiers"":  
Tier 0: Caterpie, Weedle, Ratata, Pidgeon, etc..  
Tier 1: Starter Pkmn  
Tier 2: super common pkmn  
Tier 3: common pkmn  
Tier 4: rare pkmn  
Tier 5: shiny common pkmn  
Tier 6: super rare pkmn  
Tier 7: shiny rare pkmn  
Tier 8: legendary pkmn  
Tier 9: shiny super rare pkmn  
Tier 10: shiny legendary pkmn

**Start:**  
Give random viewers a random pokemon from Tier 0  
Enable my followers to choose 1 Starter Pokemon (Bulb,Char,Squir,Pika)  
Give my Subs the option to shoose a shiny Starter.

**!Commands:**

!choose (available pkmn) --&gt; let the viewer/follower/sub choose a pkmn from their respective tier.

**Encounter Event:**  
every  10-20minutes a random group of pokemon should appear (rarity depending  on Tier lvl) for everybody in chat. (e.g ""A flock of ratatas suddenly  appeared!!!"")  
within 120 seconds viewers should have the option to (otherwise whisper to them ""nothing to throw at""):

!throwrock --&gt; 50% chance for pkmn to flee (for this user), 30% chance to increase ""catchchance"" by 20%,  
10%  chance for pkmn to be protected by higher tier pkmn (potentially caught  pkmn being exchanged for user), 10% chance to be replaced by lower tier  pkmn (If pkmn Tier &gt; Tier 2)

!throwfood --&gt;  40% chance for pkmn to flee (for this user), 40% chance to increase ""catchrate"" by 10%,  
10%  chance for pkmn to be protected by higher tier pkmn (potentially caught  pkmn being exchanged for user), 10% chance to be replaced by lower tier  pkmn (If pkmn Tier &gt; Tier 2)

!throwball --&gt; ""catchchance"" + 30% - ""Tier-rarity %"" = if  won exchange Avatar for user, else don't.  
Whisper back ""You caught a pkmnname"" or ""Damn it escaped""

obviously  each of these options above should cost ""currency"" to prevent --&gt; as  I'm new to stream avatars I'm open for suggested amounts. (so far I  only plan to have !duel, !star, and battle royal activated --&gt; open  for suggestions here as well)

!trade  (username) - offer to exchange pkmn with another user in chat. (has  60seconds to respond with !accept / !decline; else decline) - It should  whisper to the other user what he/she's being offered

fkm56k,Infradad,Trying to setup a twitch show since my concert canceled.,"Hi about 11 years back some online friends and I did a show with live visuals using ventrilio it was pretty fun performers from all over the world neat stuff. 

Now that we can’t have gatherings like we did I’m looking at trying to recreate that with a more modern platform and twitch seems like a good way to go.   I’ve live streamed myself playing music (no one watched) but to make this work I’m going to need to be able to have multiple locations all contributing thier performances, one after another not simultaneously at this point.  

Involving visualists would also amazing as they’re in the same boat as the musicians.  

Right now I’m trying to figure out what is possible if any of this is and how to go about doing it.  One limitation upfront is money, the budget for this is nonexistent the other is my performers have a wide range of technical skill, so whatever the solution is it has to be easy.    

This is a pretty big project but if anyone has any idea or resources they could point me towards it would be awesome.

Getting affiliate was also a really rewarding grinding experience. After a few days I knew that every 1-2 stream, sessions i would be able to get a new follower...sometimes 2 in one session...it event out pretty well. I really liked that, most of them felt really earned and I didn´t had to annoy my buddies to much to leave a follow, Win-Win!

1. Play with viewers - this is one of the most effective activity that lets me get people on my stream. I mostly stream Mobile legends and even though server is an issue, some of them are willing to play with me. Even if we are losing the game, they still feel connected to me.
2. Don't be a 1 way streamer - i mostly see this, a viewer ask how is the streamer and the streamer just answered I'm ok without asking back if how is the viewer. We need to interact with viewers, so why not do extra mile to ask how is he or does he also play the game ur playing.
3. Make use of ur channel points - Letting the people know about ur channel points make difference. Aside from watching you, they can also gamble their points which the chat become more active. They also become competitive with other viewers, a friendly one.
4. Socialize with other streamer - U might hear this and this is effective. But DO NOT promote yourself on other streamers chat. Just talk to the streamer, make their chat active, welcome new followers. Also, raid their streams, by doing this,  viewers can notice that you are existing, you are a friendly one.

fkl0co,SenilePandaTTV,Can anyone provide me some helpful insight for my stream? New to streaming (kinda),"I recently picked back up on streaming after maybe 1-2 sessions in the past, finally becoming more in depth with it all. 

I hit affiliate late February but have seen a sharp decline in most activity.

Pros:
-I just got sub badges in, all the way up to 6 months.  If someone gets near that I'll have my designer make badges for further out timeframes
-my info is all filled out. I have chat rules and everything on there. 
-I have my donation page and a separate widget for my extra-life donation campaign (might be a con, might turn it off until my 24 hr event in Nov)
-I talk to myself constantly.
-I have an emote for tier 1 subs.  I created it as a test to see if I could do it myself (spoiler, I can) but I plan on changing/adding more in for tier 2/3

Cons:
-I don't have a legitimate logo (yet....being created as we speak) so I look like some random with clipart skills.
-I stream while playing with friends. Sometimes my friends get political, or ignorant, drunk, or just plain toxic and railroad the stream.
-I'm also not that good at many games. I'm embracing my losses more gracefully
-I play multiple games and that may deter people from my channel
-my tier 1 sub badge is literally just a pic of me that I made into an emote.

If anyone is interested in viewing my previous videos or checking out my page, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to any and all suggestions given and would love to chat about different ways to increase views.

fkkrap,OllivanderAU,Is it a bad idea to co-own a channel with another person?,"So I'm  starting up podcast/show. I'd be doing the show with another person. What's the better idea? 

1) To have separate channels, and just incorporate each other's webcam into our separate streams. We'd basically have completely separate streams and thus completely separate financials.

2) To have one joint channel, split the revenue 50/50, and market ourselves as one brand. Obviously this is easier to grow because we're just marketing and pumping out one channel. However, the downside is that which is financially driven.

I'm considering both options. My friend said that if we do a joint channel, he's okay with me hosting myself afterwards if I decide to stream for longer and such.

fkhgti,MechaDangerous,Certain types of games make my stream choppy?,"I'm quite puzzled with my streaming issue. I use Streamlabs OBS and normally streaming RPGs and retro are no issue whatsoever. However when I start streaming Apex Legends or Warzone (action-packed FPS games) the stream is very choppy. I can't figure out why this is, or what would be causing it. My specs are as follows:

CPU: i9-9900k  
GPU: EVGA 2080 SUPER  
RAM: 32GB  
Storage: 1TB M2

The settings in SLOBS are as follows:

Encoder: NVENC (new)  
Rate Control: CBR  
Bitrate: 6000  
Keyframe Interval: 2  
Preset: Max Quality  
Profile: high  
Base (Canvas) resolution: 1920x1080  
Output (Scaled) Resolution: 1660x900  
Downscale Filter: Lanczos (Sharpened scaling, 32 samples)  
FPS Type: Common FPS Values  
Common FPS Values: 60

I've tried doing some research on the subject, but I can't find anything specific to this. I did find a video on YouTube that talked about optimal streamlabs settings, which is why they're set to what they are above.

Don't worry about donating or subbing just find a stream that makes you smile or distracts you for a while especially in these hard times that maybe ahead financially. I am not self isolating but there are many that are so lets all work together to keep things positive and do what we can to keep us all as happy as we can.

We both have our gaming PCs in the same room and a big part of our social time is hanging in our office and gaming, whether we're playing together or doing our own thing.

I feel incredibly awkward trying to talk to my chat while there is someone else in the room, and I like to have the ability to have conversations with her and not have to ignore her just because I'm streaming.

Does anyone else stream in a similar situation?

I was thinking one solution could be if I use Push to Talk on my stream, and not enable my webcam when I'm not alone, but I can't figure out how to get it to work since my webcam/mic are on a 500ms delay to sync up to my capture card. Seemed like the default Push to Talk feature in streamlabs doesn't really play nice with an audio delay, as I can't find any way to delay the mic muting to match.

&amp;#x200B;

The PC connects to the input of the capture card via HDMI, then I have the output from the capture card going into my gaming PC monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

All the audio/video comes through the stream great when selecting AVER GC551 (NVIDA HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO) as the output on the gaming PC, then inside OBS on my streaming laptop, a video capture device captures all this and plays on the stream perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what I am having trouble doing, is being able to hear the audio from my gaming PC because the output is being sent to the capture card, so plugging in headphones/speakers doesn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I would like to be able to hear the audio from the gaming PC through headphones and use Discord with my friends while live at the same time, so both my voice and their voices are played live via the stream also.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know how to achieve this because I can't wrap my head round it. :(",4,1584470519,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fkak4w/cant_get_2_computer_setup_with_capture_card/,Twitch,1
fkahl8,startsomewhere,What's allowed on Twitch?,"I've read the termsOS but they seem to be very inconsistent.

1. What types of things can we say in terms of sexual context on a mature stream? And is there going to be an issue if someone has a particularly ""sexy"" voice""? Is gaming related ASMR allowed and are they going be biased towards someone doing it if they have a particularly attractive voice?
2. Is a camera angled down seriously an issue? I've heard of people getting in trouble for this. I don't show my face (yet) but would like to unbox viewer gifts on stream, so I need to angle the camera down to avoid revealing my face.
3. Drinking is okay, as long as its not to the point of self-harm and not related to donations right?
4. The rules on cheers for incentives seem so unclear that I decided to only offer sub perks and none for bits. Is there anything that's easy to offer for cheers or am I best off not offering anything?
5. I heard that someone had been banned for having a patreon separate from Twitch, that was deemed inappropriate. I mean if I have conversations with my subscribers in a sub channel on Discord, do I have to act exactly as I do on stream or am I allowed to be unfiltered? Same goes for social media, like say a Snapchat account. What's allowed there?

its really hard to make posts on here about rules without them auto removing the post because they think you were someone who had action taken",5,1584470292,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fkahl8/whats_allowed_on_twitch/,Twitch,1

fk98py,Jedwardvincent,Quarantined | Drinking Games,"Hey Everyone! We're under quarantine here in New York, so I've been doing what most people have; gaming and drinking. 

I've been thinking about launching a channel dedicated to drinking games and thought this would be the perfect time to start it considering everyone is holed up and needs some sort of social interaction. 

Basic premise would be that:

A) A game is chosen that would be easy to create rules for, but not too easy that everyone is wasted within the first five minutes (ie; Mario maker | Every time you die, you take a drink. Every time you kill a Boom Boom, you take a drink. Every time you're soft locked, you take a drink. Etc.)

B) People can suggest and vote on new rules/games during the stream.

C) I can invite people to join the game (assuming it's multiplayer) so that we can get extra voices in chat/actual interaction outside of chat).

That's basically it. Was thinking of doing this around 9/10 Pm (est) tonight if there seems to be interest. 

If anyone wants to suggest games, I can edit to link to my steam account so you can see what's in my library. 

Once a game is selected, we can start making rules.",4,1584466158,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fk98py/quarantined_drinking_games/,Twitch,1

Here's the thing other than that I don't really know how to setup my stream stuff. In the link I took a picture of stuff I'd like you guys to help me with.

I'm currently in my final year of a Marketing degree and have begun a project on Youtubers!

In particular endorsements, and in the case of this experiment, video game endorsers.

As a result i have created not one, but two dreaded surveys! The good news is you don't have to do it, however **there is a £50 amazon voucher up for grabs** for completing just one, and if you do both you get two entries. This is a legit prize signed off by my university, details are found in the surveys.

I hope to report back here on completion of my research for streamers and youtubers wanting to know more about endorsing products :)

Any help would be much appreciated! If you would like to know more about this sutdy please message me :)

fk2el1,locolaca,Planning to multi-stream: which platform is recommended in addition to twitch? And whats the 101 of multistreaming?,"HeyGuys,

I am a small small streamer on twitch and I have the hardware and bandwidth it takes to stream to more than one platform. So I was thinking: why not? Of course, twitch is the mothership of live streaming and will be for the next years. Still, youtube and mixer (and others? are there others?) will certainly snatch a few % of market share from twitch over the next years. So I was thinking I could jump on this train early and I might grow simultaneously on two platforms as a content creator.. Well.. if I do grow ;)!

So which platform do you guys recommend? Mixer or YT? Do you have experience with multi-streaming? There are a few pro's and con's which are obvious like (YT = discoverability; Mixr = usability/more atmospheric). But whats the conclusion and how do you actually break it down?

Also, what are some aspects of multi-streaming that I might not be aware of since I havent tried it yet?

fk2d1w,Killiam_Stingray,Mic delay on stream?,"Hi, new to this sub so please be nice to me.

I'll explain my setup first, then get into the problem. So, I am streaming from my PS4 with a razer ripsaw and using StreamLabs OBS. I use Astro A40s with the TR mixamp for PS4 sound/chat and I can also hear my PC with it, but the mic I use on stream is a USB mic, which sounds better than the headset mic. 

There is a slight audio delay with the game sound and the game visuals on streamlabs so I have a delay on the visuals in streamlabs so that they match up (400 delay units with the 'Video Delay (Async)' filter, I'm not exactly sure if its milliseconds or not). That said, the people I am in a party with on PS4 are also delayed with the game sound. As I am using a separate mic to capture my voice on stream, I am always about a second or two ahead of the people I'm talking with on stream. Though in my headset, everything is normal. I tried applying the 'render delay' filter to my facecam to match the delay for the game audio and it worked, however there is no delay filter option for the mic audio. Now, my game sound, game visuals, and webcam visuals are all synced but my PC mic audio is still not delayed to match. Is there something I can do to solve this? Any help is appreciated.

He's a kid so I don't want to be a dick and just block him, but I've had to warn him plenty of times and I don't have an active mod in my channel when I stream. Wish I had one. I'm honestly at an impasse for what I should do because I'm relatively new to streaming myself and currently him viewing is keeping my average level.

I don't know what I should do for this situation, does anyone have advice for this?",7,1584415610,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fjy9lt/i_have_a_viewer_thats_becoming_too_much_to_handle/,Twitch,1

I started streaming about a month ago, got to affiliate pretty quickly, and am starting to take it a little more seriously. With that being said, I set up social accounts and want to share my clips to said socials (specifically IG and Twitter).

My QUESTION is, what is the most effective way to record and export 20-30 second clips and post them to socials? I have tried using Shadowplay, Twitch’s clip mechanism, and MedalTV.

fjqrxy,LuciferIsDeath,Not able to watch streams in higher quality?," 

I used to be able to watch Twitch streams on 720p and 1080p with no problems. But recently, about a month ago, Twitch streams kept buffering at the mentioned qualities and would even buffer in the lowest quality. After a few days, I have been able to watch seamlessly (without buffering) on 160p up to 480p, but not on the HD qualities. Even when I stream, I'm unable to watch my live video on higher qualities.

I have consulted my ISP, and they said that there was no problem. I changed my router, and even ran speed tests and they show that I'm getting the speed which I'm paying for (About 200 Mbps). I've even tried multiple DNS' to see if it makes a difference, but it doesn't.

One thing I have noticed is that while I am in an online game with a Twitch stream in the background, the game's connection slows down/ DCs whenever the Twitch stream buffers (which is like every other second on the HD qualities) and this only happens when I watch streams.

I have checked on other devices as well, and the stream lags while I am using the internet that I have. It doesn't lag when I'm on mobile (with a good connection).

The only thing I can think of changing is the settings in the router's site (the site where you type your IP address and it send you to the online router settings etc.) and I have heard that this problem could be caused due to peer connections, but I don't know how to change that.

Any help or suggestions are welcome, and I thank you in advance!

I am looking for 4 small streamers or people that just started streaming.  
Since I started working in Marketing and specialized on Social Media and Content. I thought about starting to stream games and create gaming content again.

Since I love to play MOBAs, I decided to build a 5 man streaming team that meets up to play together and create content together.

So here are the things I can offer:

\- knowledge in marketing (social media and content)

\- insights into current content on Twitch and YouTube

\- a full strategy on how this should work

&amp;#x200B;

and this is what you should bring:

\- you should be older than 18

\- availability of at least 4 nights each week

\- located in Europe

\- fluent in English

\- enough endurance to go through this process (I guess it will take several years to get to a certain   
   level) 

\- willing to play 4 different MOBAs (League of Legends, Dota 2, Smite and Heroes of the Storm)

\- willing to post and share content on Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter and probably TikTok

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you kept reading to this point and are really interested in joining me on this journey then hit me up on discord (  Spaetzle#4913 ).

fjkksu,glacierltd,Former webcam streamers who decided to go no-cam,"Hi all, looking for some intel on streamers who ditched their webcam to focus more on tigher commentary and gameplay focus.  


I recently had a week off to focus on myself and I reaaaaaally enjoyed not having bright lights on and having that feeling of being constantly on. Thankfully i'm a constant commentator with a relaxing voice so I feel my commentary is a strength on it's own (a lot of people have me alt tabbed anyway and use me for sleep/relaxing/travel etc)  


I know a lot of folk enjoy webcams for the main pull on twitch but who out there has ditched the camera, and how did it affect your stream (if at all?). I will still switch to a big screen for opening/closing and special moments so i'm not totally gone.

fjjzd6,AutoModerator,Month in Review Mega-Thread,"#Hey /r/Twitch  [](#HeyGuys)

We often see posts on the subreddit about viewers and streamers experiences, as well as streamers sharing what they've learned.  

To bring you all together to learn from your peers, and help you keep yourself accountable for any goals you've set, we created this Mega-thread!    

*This thread will be posted on the 3rd Monday of each month.*  

********  

You are welcome to share some of your experiences, positive or negative, from your past month on Twitch and, if you did, how you dealt with it, as well as share your long and short-term goals, and how you've progressed towards those over the past month.  

The Mega-thread **is not** for stream feedback or reviews, we have the monthly feedback threads for that. You **can** link to your Feedback thread submission, be sure to label it clearly!  

**********  

Some things you may want to cover:  

* New things you tried, did they work out?  
* Streams you did and which seemed to be popular or unpopular with your community or new viewers. (Creative? New games?)  
* Progress towards your goals  
* Fun experiences  
* Bad experiences that you learned from, or need advice on  
* New goals, or how you're changing your goal  
* Advice based on what you learned  
* Advice you want

Be sure to post your goals clearly and format your comment.  

Example post:  

&gt;Hey guys, checking in again!  
&gt;  
&gt; **My goal for this month** is to make sure I'm always hosting someone. I want my community to have someone to entertain them, even when I'm not live. Plus, it's good for networking!  
&gt; **My goal last month** was to always announce I was live on both Twitter and Discord, as it was something I often forgot to do. I'm glad to say I met my goal!  
&gt;  
&gt; **I tried streaming** some creative, just practicing using my graphics tablet, and it seemed to be popular! I'll do some more of it, maybe a weekly stream? Any advice?  
&gt;  
&gt; **The highlight of the past month** was when I got raided by Zcotticus, he's the best and I love him. He's so cool, I wish I could be cool like him.  
&gt;  
&gt; **How do you** guys normally react to a host? I sort of fumbled through a thank you, and that was about it. Any advice?   

*******  

**Re-read your last post to remind yourself of what you planned, or check in on your peers!**

If you don't stream, but still experienced something awesome. Feel free to share it! Did you make someone’s day? See a Win or Fail? Let us know!

fjg0c0,moog_is_love,Could I get advice/an explaination about changing my 2FA number?,"So here's the situation.  
\-Last year, I started streaming on Twitch

\-I did not have a cell phone for a long period after my previous broke, so I set up 2FA through SMS using the number of someone I know and trust.  


\-When ever I do 2FA, I have to send them an IM when the code is sent to them and ask them to copy paste it to me.  


\-I have a phone now, and I would like to switch over to using my personal number for 2FA.  


\-When I go to the twitch settings regarding 2FA security, it tells me that I would need to log in to the ""Authy"" app to change this. I don't think I ever used it or made any account with them (though I have trouble remembering)

\-I am having trouble parsing all of the information it is giving me to figure out what to do.  


\-If possible, I would like to only use SMS based authentication, as my smartphone does not have an SD card and so I have very little space left with only a few basic programs installed that I am trying to conserve, and I prefer to avoid applications that ask for permissions because it makes me uneasy. (though I realize that if they have my phone number already they can find the rest of my identifying information pretty easily... meh.)  


So. You can probably guess my question by this point. How do I get 2FA set up on my new phone?  


Would disabling it, then starting over from scratch work?  


Should I just bite the bullet and install the app? Would that help me in this situation because of (to my knowlege) my auth method is not associated with the app?  


It warned of the potential that changing a phone number might take a few days. Should I be concerned about that? Everyone trying to stay inside has inspired me to want to stream for some friends to make it a little bit easier on them and myself, so I don't want to get bogged down by an issue like that.  


Post got longer than I thought it would! Anyway, yeah, I'm hoping someone out there with a better understanding of this 2FA system can tell me what the best course of action is in this situation.

fjf700,solar_storm25,Frame loss SLOBS," Hi all.

I'm at my wits end with an issue I've been experiencing since mid-November. After streaming for 2-3 months nearly every day for hours at a time, I began experiencing horrendous frame drops that made the stream unwatchable to everyone. Despite having pretty decent speeds, (100mbs download/10mbs upload on ethernet) streaming became completely impossible. Below are the following steps I took to try and remedy:

1. Upgrading my modem, which boosted my download speed up to 180mbs (turns out it was time for an upgrade anyway) but the issue persisted.
2. Did several stream tests, dropping the quality down to 360p and a bitrate as low as 500 and I was *still* having frame drops -- I should note that I normally streamed at 720p with a bitrate of about 3500 before having these issues.
3. Called my ISP (Cox) several times in order to find the issue. They could not detect a single malfunction on either end.
4. ISP sent a technician to the house around the end of January. All speeds perfect. What he did do was install a MoCa filter on our modem which worked! *For a limited time*.

Now the issues have cropped back up in the last couple weeks almost worse than before and I can't for the life of me figure out why. Part of me wants to think its a hardware issue but my games aren't experiencing lag or stuttering of any kind; it's only the stream. My only other theory is that there is some sort of network interference from a neighbor's house but to me, that doesn't make any sense. If anyone has any ideas, I'd greatly appreciate it.

fjeero,1L1dan,Settings for dual PC+NDI," 

Hi!

Currently I'm trying to find best settings for my dual OC config for streaming, but I'm not satisfied with the result since image has bad quality(in my opinion, correct me if I am wrong).

For example:

[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/567886544](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/567886544)

As a gaming PC I have the following:

CPU-i9-9900K

GPU-RTX 2070

RAM-32 Gb 3100 MHz

MB-ASUS PRIME Z370-PII

2x144hz displays

As a streaming PC I have:

CPU-AMD Ryzen 7 3800X

GPU-RTX 2060

RAM-16 Gb 3133 MHz

MB-MSI B450 Gaming Plus MAX

1x60hz display

To configure LAN I use TP-Link TL-SG1008D.

On gaming PC I use OBS to make an NDI output, but on streaming PC I use Streamlabs OBS. Don't know if it can be the issue in my case, but just a note.

My gaming PC OBS setting are:

Unfortunately our other emote slots are filled with emotes critically tied to my channel's culture/media involved with the stream so I cant just forget about them.

So personally if you're an affiliate would you pay twitch say $5-$10 a month to have more emote slots at tier 1 for your subs?

I'm a pretty new streamer, and I'm hitting my wall with understanding how encoder settings truly work, and what it actually means to setup a ""perfect stream"". I'm here in hopes that someone can show me how to put that finesse on my stream settings so I can have a fluid stream every stream.

I started streaming about 2 months ago, and everything's been super fluid. My streams have been great, the quality has been great, my game performance isn't hindered by it, nothing. Nothing was wrong until about 3 days ago when I started streaming CoD: Warzone. I had a few good streams of it, but, every day I streamed, the quality deteriorated further and further. It's now to the point to where I cannot even stream because of how many skipped frames, dropped frames, dramatically low FPS, &amp; etc I'm experiencing. I don't know why this has happened, I haven't a single clue. Mind you, this ONLY happens when I load up Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. When I'm playing something else, or not on a game at all, everything's fine. It's as smooth as a hot knife on butter. But the moment I load up CoD, it's all over. Also keep in mind, I streamed CoD for weeks prior to these issues with ZERO issues. Same settings, same everything. Not a single problem. Then, out of no where, all hell on earth. I've adjusted my bitrate 20 different times. I've changed my key frame interval from 0 to 1 to 2 back to 0 back to 2 back to 1, etc. I've changed my presets, I've changed my profile quality, I've changed EVERYTHING in every way I could possible to try and get some sort of positive result - nothing.

My current hardware (which is more than enough to be capable of running a smooth stream and gaming from the same machine):  

* CPU: Ryzen 7 3700x
* CPU Cooler: Corsair H100i RGB PLATINUM AIO
* GPU: EVGA GeForce 2070 Super RTX 8GB
* RAM: G.Skill Trident Z RGB 3200 mhz 32gb
* MB: ASUS ROG Strix B450-I
* SSD: Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD 1TB

I was thinking of eating something spicy or shaving my head at the top spots, but I don't know any challenges or milestone to start the journey. I was thinking on the middle parts having some drinking too (with the responsibility of course) to make it a little more fun.

My chat was moving quickly so I didn't see it immediately but everyone informed me and I took care of the problem no big deal.  Of course this would be a scenario where a mod would be useful.  

For backstory (I know I'm long winded sorry!) I had a group of mods I appointed awhile ago but they no longer come to my streams.  They were people I knew irl so I've never really had to ask someone to mod for me.  Is that what I should do ask a regular?  Or wait for them to ask?  I'm super worried about putting this responsibility on someone and also not sure I have enough regulars that would be willing.  What kind of other resources do I have? Bots?

fj3unf,conmasterx,Cheapest option for a secondary encoding pc?,"Hey all,  I've seen this question asked fairly regularly but I never seem to get an answer to my specific situation.

My main pc that I currently both stream and game from is:

Ryzen 1600 @ factory oc
Reference Vega 64
32gb Corsair Vengeance @ 3200mhz

It tends to handle streaming pretty well, but when I get the occasional frame drops in games, it causes my stream to delay a bit. I have a very overlay-heavy design, so it can be rather taxing to run just the stream encoding. Because of this, I'm looking to get a second pc for encoding the stream.

So here are my two options. I have an old crappy laptop with some quad core i5 at 3.2ghz, 8GB of slow ram and an Igpu. If I were to get that up and running, do you thing it would be able to encode my stream at 720p 60fps? And if so, is there a free way to get my gameplay to it without a capture card?

My second option is building a dedicated stream pc. I have a very low budget (£200) and I assume I would have to factor in the cost of a capture card. Afaik there's nothing cheap enough that could deliver that kind of quality. I'm in a bit of a pickle.

Any tips would be appreciated! I know I'm expecting a lot of quality for such a low cost, but that's the path I've chosen. B)",1,1584289392,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fj3unf/cheapest_option_for_a_secondary_encoding_pc/,Twitch,1

&amp;#x200B;

I tried different ways to fix it but nothing helped. :(   

&amp;#x200B;

I tried: Elgato Sound Capture. ( Works but i got a sound delay)  

Connected both PCs with 3.5 aux cable and with virtual audio cable. (No Sound)   

&amp;#x200B;

I really dont know what else to do.   

Also i would like to know if i have to run Streamlabs to get the sound of the gaming pc into my streaming pc.   

Thank you.

fj34qs,HappyCow2011,Interviews with streamers and viewers," Hello everyone,

I am currently working on my bachelors thesis in Germany and need streamers (preferable with VR experience, but not necessary) and viewers (mods would be cool, but also not necessary) who watch Twitch on a regular basis for a little interview. My topic is about streaming of VR-games, and why it is so unpopular on Twitch compared to non-VR streams.

For my research I need streamers who can tell me a bit about their streaming experience as well as viewers. I would like to interview you over text chat on discord and of course, we treat the data collected anonymously and in strict confidence.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested and if you have anymore questions, I am happy to give you some more information.

Thank you, I appreciate any help I can get!",12,1584286682,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fj34qs/interviews_with_streamers_and_viewers/,Twitch,1

I ran speed tests just to make sure the problem wasn't on my end. My ISP promises 5Mbps upload and I was getting 4.8 which is excellent but the problem kept occurring so I decided to contact my ISP. They said there was a signal problem so a technician came and fixed it. It didn't affect anything it only improved my ping and the technician left telling me that it's a problem with Twitch's servers. I normally was able to stream 720p at 3200kbps without any problem. Now, when I try to stream 720p at 3200kbps, the average is around 2100kbps in which case the stream starts to lag.

It will lower my stream counts, but may make my content more consistent. So two questions. 

1 - Any successful tips in keeping viewers engaged during D&amp;D play? It seems more geared towards watching, so maybe switch D&amp;D to YouTube?

2-Does it make sense to drop content from a channel in the name of consistent content and losing the multistream while growing.

fj0q61,AardvarkMonarch,Problem with a specific VOD,"This is a sub-only VOD channel, so the YT clip here is for demonstration purposes.

https://youtu.be/S5w97N0IKT8

This is the first time I've ever seen this problem. A 2 hour stream last night supposedly has a ""10 hour long"" VOD (and the length keeps increasing). And it's not that he left it on, as the page clearly says he's not broadcasting.

Yet, when actually playing it back, it only shows the first hour. After that, it skips past random parts of the stream for 3 minutes before ending way too prematurely.

I'm not sure if there is a fix for this or not, but it has never been a problem for me or this channel before.It's frankly, *bizarre* and I have *no* idea how or even why this is happening.

If there is any fix or workaround to view the full VOD, or even so he can prevent this from happening in the future, it would be much appreciated.

If you've been living in a fucking Hobbit hole or you just don't give two flying fucks about this lemme explain what's going on, from what I've seen and heard there are a lot of fucking situations were streamers who are hot and female do something that breaks the community guidelines, but they don't get banned for shit, for example: alinity, the thrower of cats and the alcoholic of Columbia, she has done some major shit that deserves her account being permanently suspended, for example, alinity threw her cat, she didn't get suspended, alinity gave her cat vodka, which if you don't know is toxic to cats, and she didn't get suspended, but this other female streamer who wasn't as attractive threw her cat, and got suspended, that's really fuckin biased. Now there was a recent situation of a streamer who was part of sOar, but now isn't, he shot a gun live on stream and a bullet hit a container of gfuel, and he gets permanently suspended, and gets kicked off of sOar, you fucking kidding me? People acted like children watch twitch and reported him, if you know who I'm talking about and you reported him, fuck you, you ruined his life, anyway back to my point, there are a lot of situations where streamers say something that sounds like nigger and get suspended, even if it's a harmless word, now I can go on and on but I got a few questions.
1. how the fuck did  these fuckers at the twitch mod team not lose their jobs yet? They can and will fuck over streamers by messing up their reputation and income just for fun, and I don't even fucking understand how they haven't been fired or anything like that, it's fucking retarded.
2. Why are they sexist, because they ban a whole hell of a lot of male streamers, but barely any female streamers, how fucking fair is that? You're telling me that alinity sucking the dick and getting fucked in the pussy by the whole moderater team gets her a pass to do literally anything? And plus people who said ban alinity got banned instead! 
3. Why the fuck is this even happening!?

* The Version.
   * I currently own regular ol' Skyrim, but if I'm going to be streaming it, should I invest in the special edition? Or would it be more prudent to simply install a bunch of graphics mods (Because I assume I'm going to attract more viewers if I have better graphics)? I really don't know what to do here because I don't know which of these options would run more smoothly.

* The Mods.
   * I... really don't know my way around Nexusmods. Hell, I don't know my way around a computer in general. I'm not a programmer. It's been a couple years since I really played Skyrim and installed all the mods I did. Just booted up the game a little while ago and it works just fine, but I feel like it might be smarter to wipe them all and just start from scratch. ...If I knew which mods to get. …….And if I knew which version of the game I was going to play.

I'm new to Twitch. I started streaming about 10 days ago. In the past 2-3 days, however, it continues to freeze. My connection is 20 Mbps in upload, and to stream I set 5 Mbps.

fipwmi,Alpaca_Pack,Why does my dynamic mic sound so echo-y?,"To preface, I'm an audio noob, and this is my first rodeo when it comes to audio interfaces and XLR mics. I recently bought a Rode Podmic and a Motu M2 for general gaming and streaming, and I finally put my entire setup together, it looks great. However, on my first use of the mic and interface, my freinds kept telling me that I sounded like I was using a laptop microphone, and that it sounded like I was in an extremely echo-y room. I do acknowledge that I game in a room on the smaller side, and that I don't have acoustic panels on my walls, but I was under the impression that a dynamic mic would do a good job at isolating my voice. They also tell me they can hear my keyboard loudly, and I have Cherry MX reds, so not even tactile switches. I kinda just plugged-and-played with my Rode Podmic, so would I solve my issue with downloading a some software to address this problem? Or do I need to change my sample-rate and bit-depth in the Motu driver?

(I tried Google and couldn't find the answer)

So, I stream exclusively from my PS4 currently. I've been doing all of my streams without a camera to capture myself. I have heard from a few people the pack of camera may be detrimental to trying to grow my following. 

Ok, here's my question: is it better to just buy the PS Camera and stream my video content that way, or is it more advisable (and possible) to get a web cam for my computer and manage my stream/video through the computer while just streaming my game from my PlayStation?

Like I said, not sure if it's even feasible. But, trying to learn the best ways to do things.

Would a camlink be compatible with both of these cameras? If not, what should I use?

Yet our payout today was $92USD. Which is super weird to me. But even weirder is that I thought the whole thing with payouts was if you don’t hit 100 it’ll carry over til you do. So I’m just really confused if I’m just overreacting or if there’s an issue I should bring up with twitch about this.

- how do I stay anonymous on twitch. I know that when you use PayPal and people donate to you, they'll get to see your name on the bill.
The ""easy"" solution for many is to just get a business account but this isn't an option in my country because when I do, I will have to create an official company, which costs money, which also puts you in a national registrer where people can type in your company name and find your full name and address that way. Long story short, it's not an option for me.

What are the alternatives out there? Could I use patreon? I also looked into ""buymeacofee"" but they also show your name on the receipt.

And what about twitch? I'm using streamlabs obs. Can I set up bits and cheers or whatever without them getting my information? And if I do set that up will they also be able to donate or can I turn that option off. Because streamlabs has been practically begging me to add PayPal for all the additional services it can offer when you do. But I'm afraid it'll open the gates to my identity.

I've been watching a ton of videos on growing your stream (branding, getting discovered, making enjoyable content, etc.). One of the content creators instrumental in the growth of my channel would Devin Nash's channel.

Although I am an affiliate, I am still a small streamer and am still working towards growing my stream to the standard of quality that I'm comfortable having people subscribe/donate to.

While Mixer hasn't been successful, the extra traction to Twitter has appeared to be somewhat successful and I'd like to keep that exposure if it'll continue to benefit me.

Just wanted to know if there’s any way to actually track users who interact with mobile push notifications or just notification a i’m general?

I wanted to set up a “Notification Squad” to promote some rewards to viewers who came to the stream from clicking on the notification. 

As of right now, I wanted to implement some type of reward for interacting with the notification. For example, whomever uses the notification over a period of 30 days, would earn points. Then at the start of the next month, I’d give them a gifted sub. I’d be doing it to also help myself, since I’ve been trying to quit smoking, and I rather give someone a gifted sub than buy another pack of cigarettes. 

I’m sure there are other ways of implementing something like this, which I am open to suggestions, it essentially I feel like it’s a win-win-won situation for myself so I can quit smoking, for my viewers to get a gifted sub and to increase viewership and interaction in my channel.

fiavfy,TryMyBR,Streamlabs audio issue,"I’ve researched for 2 days on how to fix it, and with absolutely no answers, I’m here for help. 
I use an ElGato HD60S+ for PS4 streaming, OBS studio worked fine with minimal issues but I switched to SLOBS for the multi stream. 
The issue: 
When I let SLOBS idle for about 2 minutes (not streaming) the audio/video starts stuttering/chopping*? The only way I can fix it is to move my mouse every 2-3 minutes. I have no idea how to fix this, but I have tried a lot of other audio fixes I’ve seen online with no success.

fi9ulz,BenSolo12345,Video editor looking for work.,"Hey everyone - 

I’m a film student at Boston University who’s stuck home for a while due to the coronavirus, which means I can’t work at my normal job. So I’m looking for some extra work I can do remotely on the side.

As a third year student, I’m a pretty advanced video editor with professional experience - I’ve done promo videos for an athletics company, in addition to more traditional work on short films and the like.

I’d like to work with a streamer to create short promo videos or compilations to build your channel - maybe around 3:00 in length? My prices will be very reasonable and we can discuss something that works for both of us - I’m not out to rip anyone off!

Please let me know if anyone is interested!

fi5q5j,IJustSpawned,Why do you stream?,"When you stream to your viewers you’re sharing your conscious waking thoughts with the world. 

Every time I start up my stream and start talking to my friends I think about how my words and actions are going to effect them. I think about their days and lives more than I ever have before. Not just because I want people to like my streams, but because I genuinely feel a sense of passion and enjoyment about making sure their lives are going well.

I think that’s the case because you feel that eyes are on you and you want to be the best possible version of yourself that you can be in your streams. It’s made me a better, happier person looking towards the bright side of things. 

Recently I unfortunately had to let a toxic friend out of my life because he didn’t understand why I had enforced certain rules while I was streaming. He told me “I play games to have fun not to be politically correct” 

Everyone chooses to play games how they wish too but I didn’t appreciate his ignorance towards myself and my viewers so I had to cut him off. 

Before streaming, I wouldn’t have the outlook on life that I have today and I am incredibly excited to do something everyday that I love which I had yet to find in my life. 

So tell me, why do you love to stream?

I did most of my Twitch.TV viewing on my television, but now I very rarely watch Twitch.TV because I can't access it on my TV through the apps.

I'm an affiliate streamer and I'd like to have emotes of a fictional character (Chilly Willy). The emotes are probably going to be ''fan drawing'', but I'm not sure if they're going to be accepted by twitch or not. Will I have any problems or is it ok? what are the conditions about it?

I need to ask before trying to upload them, because I'm probably going to pay a designer for the emotes, and getting the emotes rejected  wouldn't be the most optimal thing.

fi2chx,C4_567,Questions About Setting up Stream Audio (PS4 gameplay + mic),"I have a good quality mic (CAD Audio U37) and capture card (Elgato HD60s), but I'm new to streaming and don't know how to set everything up.

Right now I'm messing around with settings by myself, googling questions appropriately, but I figured it couldn't hurt to throw my problems at Reddit too, because if anybody here knows quick fixes to some of these issues, it'd be convenient to have them answered without wasting a bunch of time figuring it out myself.

Again, new to all of this, and my biggest problem is I know NOTHING about audio/video, so I expect most of these problems are going to sound pretty basic to experts out there.

So I guess just... be gentle? Lol 

(And thanks in advance for anybody who actually reads these things. You're pretty cool.)

\---

So here are my main issues (only focusing on audio right now, because I'm just running capture at lowest possible bitrates/framerates to make sure the stream runs smoothly while testing sound out):

* Mic picks up on background noise (keyboard typing, mousing clicking, button pressing, etc.) a lot. I have a pop screen, but pretty sure that doesn't matter for this type of issue. Should I just keep my mic farther away from my hands, or is there a technical solution to this?
* My voice is slightly soft when I listen back to the stream using headphones. It could be that I'm just not talking loud enough, because when I turn the Live Commentary audio up much more past 50 (1 dB), that's when my voice starts to get distorted. So while I think I should just talk louder, I am curious, what do most streamers keep their Live Commentary set on? Does 1 dB seem normal?
* My game audio coming out of the TV is being picked up by the mic. I can hear, for example, a sword clang twice in a row after swinging it. I'm fine with using headphones to check on stream audio (so the mic doesn't pick up my own stream audio and create the infinite distortion problem), but I *hate* wearing headphones for long periods of time, and see streamers that play games without them. So clearly there's a way to get rid of the overlap without muting your TV, right? How is this done?
* That's all for now, though I know there's a ton more to clean up. I'd like to not drop any more money on additional equipment, but if some of my problems can **only** be solved with proper tools, so be it, but I'd like to consider budget options first.

Thanks again! (Or if nobody responds to this, then screw all you :D)",6,1584116931,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fi2chx/questions_about_setting_up_stream_audio_ps4/,Twitch,1
fi1xyg,WorthDog7,Ideas for Sub/Bit/Donation goals?,"I average around 60 viewers on Twitch for the last 2 months and even double-checked to make sure they are real. My chat is somewhat active and I do interact as I go along, throwing in random jokes when the chat is stagnant. I've noticed that my subscriber counts have been very low. I only have 20 subscribers despite averaging 60 viewers. While I don't do Twitch solely for money but when you look at other streamers with even 40 viewer averages, they can still get 100+ subs consistently. 

So what I thought of is, what are some nice but not desperation ideas for increasing sub/bit/donation goals? It seems like I am doing what's right to attract viewers but most of them tend to not sub.

fi1h23,Daikota,Streamlabs OBS Custom Chat Staircase Messages," Hello,  I hope I can find someone who is familiar with CSS, HTML or JS  I am currently trying to customize my chat a bit, unfortunately I have little idea about it and could not find much on the Internet. 

 What I want is that my chat is displayed like a staircase in the stream. How the stairs run around is rather unimportant to me.  

Explanation: Whenever a user posts a message, we don't just push the last message upwards, but also a little to the right or down to the left.   The only thing I found is where someone had this as a problem and just wanted it normal. In addition, the stairs were not always the same. But the steps were shifted, sometimes in front of it, sometimes behind. 

Ihope you can understand what im searching for.

I know the basics, good setup, humor, creativity etc etc. That’s not a problem for me. My main concern is that since I’m indian, people may not want to watch me because of my accent. I’ve read through Quora and Reddit of people complaining it’s because of our pronunciation and them not being able to understand us. Now, I do have clear pronunciation and if you meet me in real life you won’t have trouble understanding me at all. But I do still have the Indian accent, which I fear may be a turn off for a large amount of people. I plan on doing videos and streaming. I don’t only want to target the Indian community, I want a large diversity of viewership which is why I ask this. Also I won’t change my accent because that’s a part of me and my identity, but I can work on making it easier for people to understand me more. But the question still lies, will people from other countries want to watch me?? I haven’t seen any Indian streamer who’s famous outside the Indian community who has an Indian accent. Maybe I haven’t looked enough but still. That’s really discouraging.",18,1584110906,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fi0rn6/will_my_accent_cause_a_problem_to_gain_viewers/,Twitch,1

# Clip Contest

**How it works:** 


A similair thread will be posted every two weeks. Eligible community members will then post a link to their Clip, and the submission that gets **the most up-votes** throughout the two weeks will have their channel featured for a month on the subreddit sidebar! The second week of the contests is reserved for voting. This thread will be locked after one week.

**Rules for Entry:**

* One Clip submission per contest. If you are currently in the sidebar, **can't enter this time**.

* The Clip submission **must** be from your own channel, and can't be a previous winning clip.

* The Clip submission **must** be a [**Twitch Clip**](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2442508-how-to-use-clips) and not another platform.  
  
* If your content is NSFW (i.e. profanity) then please **mark it** as such.

* [Purple+](https://purple.plus/) introductions **are no longer required.**  

 &gt;We haven't seen as many entries to the clip contest as we have in the past, so we have decided **purple+ intros are no longer required to participate**. We hope this this will encourage more users to participate. 


**The Rewards:** 

* Your channel gets **featured** on the next Clip Contest thread, and you will be on the sidebar for a whole month. We're hoping this brings your channel some **extra attention**!

**Other things to keep in mind:** 

* **Do not create throwaway accounts to up-vote/down-vote:** This is against [Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and anyone found creating throwaway/alternate accounts to manipulate the votes will be reported to Reddit admins.

* **Do not ask people to up-vote your submission:** This is also against [Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and anyone found asking for votes will be reported to Reddit admins.
**This includes sharing your submission with your community in any format.**  
  
**Voting:**

The winner of the contest is determined by the number of up-votes a submission receives. So voters, you play a **vital** role in this contest. For those who are unsure how to up-vote a comment, you simply click the top-most Glitch icon that's pointing upwards located left of the comment. If successful the [Glitch icon will turn purple and you will get an approving](https://i.imgur.com/RMj4eDY.png)  [](#PogChamp) [animation](https://i.imgur.com/RMj4eDY.png).

fhyfjo,PanJan97,What's your shtick/gimmick? :),"I'm laying in bed, thinking about cool interactive things to do on stream, when suddendly... why not ask reddit for some inspiration? :D

What cool things do u guys do on stream? With a command, for a follow, or generally. What is your shtick, or gimmick?

fhydhk,eVorg31116,An idea for channel points,"I was messing with channel points today, and I think that the whole idea is good, but it is flawed. I dont want to reward individual viewers over others, because they have more time available to watch my stream. Therefore, all my rewards are beneficial to the entire stream, and not an individual viewer. 

I thought it would be interesting if twitch allowed viewers to combine their points towards a larger goal, whenever they wanted, and when the channel put that many points into a reward, the streamer could do something. For example, on my stream I will do a twitch songs stream if someone hits 1,000,000 points. Obviously that is rediculous, but if I was able to make it so people could slowly fill it up and earn a reward together, it could be pretty cool. 

Obviously there are issues involved, such as people making farm accounts and the like, but I'm sure twitch could make changes, such as not being able to earn points until you've followed for a certain amount of time and stuff like that.",7,1584100058,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fhydhk/an_idea_for_channel_points/,Twitch,1

fhwq6y,Lexi5Rex,"First big raid, are things looking up just before the end?","I was streaming the Isle, like always, and out of the blue someone I've never seen before raids with like 20 people. So cool! The only thing is that they raided right as I ended my stream. So I had to type my thanks on chat and watch them drop like flies. 

I've been streaming for about 4 months and I never get more than 3 viewers, still haven't got the goal of more than 5 chatters at once. 

I'm not the kinda person who really cares about views or popularity, but I did try to start streaming hoping I could make some friends and at least build a small community of regular viewers. After that happened though I realized I should make a schedule and really work on intro and outro scenes that way it doesn't happen like that again. It also made me realize how fast someone can go from a nobody to a ""big streamer"".

The sad thing is, I really started doing this out of desperation because I'm so depressed from not finding real work, despite my endless job hunting. I thought I could make something for myself on the platform, but it turns out it's really hard to do so. On top of all of this, I don't think I'll be on twitch for long because I'm going to lose my home soon and I may be homeless. So I'll have to sell my computer just to get enough money to travel out of state. I don't want to be homeless in California. 

This recent event made me really hope that it happens again and made me re-think why I'm on there. Im really just having fun and trying to de stress while I get my mind off studies and searching for work, but what if it's do or die? I have nothing going for me IRL except debt and misfortune. What if it's either makes it big or live on the street? What if my channel grows right as I have to hit the road?

That would be very synchronous with most of the occurrences in my life, a larger version of what happened tonight. 

I dont know why I posted this, maybe I am just looking for some sort of way to express myself, possibly make a friend, or get some feedback (good or bad). I'm a real loner and a single dad. I don't have any friends really. I have a few online acquaintances but no one I'd really call my friend. Left many ""friends"" in my personal life behind to pursue a better, more positive and productive life. I just made some bad choices and pulled the short straw too many times. 

Anyways thanks for reading this. I hope everyone is healthy and has a good night. Take Care Twitch peeps.",15,1584090276,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fhwq6y/first_big_raid_are_things_looking_up_just_before/,Twitch,1

fhot4u,Twitty390,Best OBS Settings for i7-9700k + RTX 2080?,"I'm just now getting into streaming and have been experience all kinds of different experiences it seems like every time I turn on my stream. I mostly have been playing Fortnite trying to get the most frames possible for a better competitive experience. I'm still new to dialing in the right settings for my stream because I feel that SLOBS auto setup isn't as good as it should be. If anyone has any suggestions for my stream setup it would be greatly appreciated! Here's my setup..

Custom Build PC:

\-I7-9700K (AUTO CLOCKED TO 4.9GHZ WITH ""AI SUITE 3"")

\-RTX 2080 8GB (Slightly Overclocked)

\-32GB 3200 RAM

\-CORSAIR H100I LIQUID COOLER

\-EVO DRIVES, SSDs, ETC..

\-226.3 MPBS DOWN / 11.1 MBPS UP

One of the biggest problems I've been experiencing is an undescribable laggy feel when I start streaming Fortnite. The game almost feels like it has a delay and becomes very annoying when I'm trying to play. I also notice a noticeable frame lost when streaming but I guess that makes sense due to the high CPU usage. Typically I sit at my locked 240 frames when I'm not streaming but when I turn on the stream I notice drops to around 80-120 frames with an avg of probably 180-200. I just feel like either the game is in a buggy state atm or my settings are not competly setup correctly. Let me know if I missed anything that I should've posted in this post.

I am happy to announce that /u/chasieyofacie is the latest winner of the /r/Twitch Clip Contest!  
Here's their winning submission: 

&gt;**Submission**: [Chat always clips things out of context. NSFW-suggestive?] (https://www.twitch.tv/chasieyofacie/clip/ObliviousUnusualLobsterFailFish?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time)

&gt;**Game**: Borderlands 3

&gt;**Description**: My chat likes to make clips that can be taken the wrong way without context.  I beat a boss and they do their thang.

New Clip contest will open up tomorrow on March 13th! Please continue reading below for everything you need to know if you want to take part in the contest!

We haven't seen as many entries to the clip contest as we have in the past, so we have decided **purple+ intros are no longer required to participate**. We hope this this will encourage more users to participate.

# Clip Contest Information

**What is it?**  The Clip Contest is an opportunity for /r/Twitch community members like yourself to gain exposure for their broadcast through various rewards, by submitting a Twitch Clip from their broadcast.  

**How does it work?** I will post a bi-weekly thread and sticky it for visibility every two weeks. Eligible community members will then post a link to their Clip, and the submission that gets **the most up-votes** throughout the two weeks will have their channel featured on the subreddit sidebar! The second week of the contest is reserved for voting, so I will be locking the contest thread **one week to ending**.  

**Are there any Rules for entry?** Yes. If you hope to take part in the upcoming contest, then you must abide by the following set of rules:

**Rules for Entry:**

* One Clip submission per contest. If you are currently in the sidebar, **can't enter this time**.

* The Clip submission **must** be from your own channel, and can't be a previous winning clip.

* The Clip submission **must** be a Twitch Clip and not another platform.  
  
* If your content is NSFW (i.e. profanity) then please **mark it** as such.

* [Purple+](https://purple.plus/) introductions are **no longer** required.  


**You mentioned Rewards?** Indeed I did, here's a list of all the amazing rewards you can win:

* Your channel gets **featured** on the next Clip Contest thread, and you will be on the sidebar for two months. We're hoping this brings your channel some **extra attention**!

* Your [Purple+](https://purple.plus/) introduction will be **shared** in the Winner announcement thread, so everyone can **learn more** about your channel!
  
* One Tweet of **your stream from our twitter!** (Must follow [@TwitchSubreddit](https://twitter.com/TwitchSubreddit).)^^^Must ^^^claim  
  
**Anything else?** Yep, here are a few mores things that you should keep in mind when entering:

* **Do not create throwaway accounts to up-vote/down-vote:** This is against [Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and anyone found creating throwaway/alternate accounts to manipulate the votes will be reported to Reddit admins.

* **Do not ask people to up-vote your submission:** This is also against [Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and anyone found asking for votes will be reported to Reddit admins. **This includes sharing your submission with your community in any format.**  

***

Don't forget to create an profile on [Purple+](https://purple.plus). It's another chance to get your channel out there, plus you get an awesome badge flair icon next to your name here on the subreddit! 

Also if you have any suggestions or feedback on how the contest should be ran or other ideas for possible rewards, then please reach out to us via [modmail] (https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTwitch).

fhiccv,Prodimator_,I never thought it would be this much fun,"I have had this idea in my head for the past few years about what it would be like to stream. I never actually pulled the trigger and tried it because I just assumed “what’s the point, no one would watch me and how could I possibly be THAT interesting”. It wasn’t until a few days ago that I finally committed to giving it a try. I booted up a game and clicked “Go Live” and wow was I in for a surprise.

No one came to join me on that first stream, but I didn’t really care. The potential behind it was so amazing to me. Designing my stream overlays and setting up all the configurations to create my own personal experience and then seeing it in action was incredible and I couldn’t wait to try again.

My second stream went even better. I got raided by a buddy of mine and had 6 WHOLE HUMAN BEINGS WATCHING ME. This was crazy. I now had people to share in that experience that I am crafting! Ultimately, I decided to pull the trigger because I want to share these experience that gaming creates with other people and hang out. These 2 streaming experiences were fantastic and I am itching to get back in the seat and continue. I’m so excited to see where this journey takes me and I hope that people can come along with me.

fhfe00,Kend0za,Name is taken on all social media platforms,"Hello!  
So earlier this week I made a post about if I should stick with the alias ""Kendoza"" or switch to something more simple and more generic like ""Shy"" but have since then decided to stick with my unique name Kendoza.

The only issue I have is now trying to choose a name that I could take on all social media platforms. As of right now I have the name ""Kend0za"" and it's was very easy to secure them on all platforms but the issue is that I don't want to be known as Kendoza with a zero, but would rather be known as Kendoza. Kendoza is taken on all social media platforms and the only place where I've been successful in taking it are in the games I play like League of Legends, Overwatch, R6, etc. 

I've been trying to do my research on what I could add to my name and so far I've thought of switching it to either, ""xKendoza"" or ""Kentothedoza."" That way when people search for me they won't get as confused compared to if they were searching up Kendoza with a zero. 

I don't wanna add like FPS or lol to my name because I plan on being a variety streamer in the future nor want to add things like TV or OnTwitch because I have personal friends and family on Instagram rather than solely subscribers/followers.

If you guys have any ideas on what I could add or switch in my name so I could still be known as Kendoza rather than Kendoza with a zero, please let me know :D",11,1584015264,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fhfe00/name_is_taken_on_all_social_media_platforms/,Twitch,1

fhe5fi,PossiblyMarsupial,USB to mini-usb cable with on off switch for blue Yeti: Exists or no? If no: recommendations for making one?,"Hello all :).

I use a blue yeti for streaming (and other voice chat) and quite like it, but am a bit miffed it doesn't have an off-button. Yeah, I can just unplug it, but it's getting a bit annoying having to plug and unplug it at least once a day (it's in my bedroom) as I don't want it muted and blinking through the night. I'd prefer to just have it powered when in use (no reason to waste power!), which right now would mean plugging and unplugging multiple times a day. So I came up with another solution, being a usb to mini usb cable with a switch in the middle, like a light switch basically, so I can just interrupt the flow along the cable as desired. I had a quick search online, but all I can find is USB switches in the sense of hubs, not in the sense of with an in-line switch. Does anyone know if such a thing exists? I'm in the UK, so US examples of where to buy might not be useful.

If it does NOT exist, would anyone have any tips on how to make one? I've inserted switches, clocks, etc into regular power cables in the past, replaced plugs and the like so I'm comfy tinkering. However, I know very little about the internals of a USB cable. E.G. is it all homogeneous or are there different lines twisted together that should only connect to themselves etc? What kind of switch would be appropriate? Etc. 

Other ingenious solutions for the problem would be welcome too! Just keep in min there is little space for an adapter under the mic itself due to the stand and I often change the position of the mic in the stand, so I can't have stuff sticking out too far underneath. There is space behind the pc for adapters or other shenanigans, but that's not easily accessible, so a solution there would have to be remotely accessed somehow. There is no space for a USB hub near the mic that I could power off (and that would leave the hub powered, which is yet another device eating power whilst that isn't needed).

fhe26j,MichelPostma,How can I merge 2 twitch chats into one webpage/overlay?,"Hey there,

Now that squad streaming allows for viewers to more easily watch two streams at once, duo-streaming has been helped a lot.

However, my biggest problem with streaming together with someone is that we don't have a combined chat where both of us can see what is going on with the other. 

What I would love to create is a webpage that pulls the Twitch chat from both stream A and stream B and then posts them on a green background in order of timestamps. So that as a Streamer I can have one window with all the chat messages and I can key out the background and put it in my overlay as well. 

I would also like to color code the Usernames to a specific color for Stream A and Stream B in order to distinguish between them.

However, I don't have a lot of experience at all with creating something like this and I cannot find any point to start off with, as all my searches just lead to 'how to embed Twitch chat into website'.

fhdatk,vilgefartz,Looking for testers for new Twitch Extension,"Hi all.

I'm developing a Twitch Extension that i'd like to publish, but i need test my code and server a bit to make sure they can hold up.

The game itself is a multiplayer scissors paper rock, that runs on a single thread. Which means there will only be one game running at a time per channel, and if you're not a player, you're a spectator. The idea to present it as either a component overlay, or a video overlay, depending on your preferences. Once the programming is mostly done, the game will look like a retro arcade fighter, with various characters, health bars, high-scores etc. It doesn't have any graphics at the moment, because i'm still trying to find an artist i can hire to do it in the style i'd like.

**The testing**

Even though the extension is in development, i can still permit particular channels to load the extension and use it. What i'd like to find is multiple streamers with at least a couple of viewers who would use the extension. I'm looking to find some edge cases where the app/server breaks, and to fix them so it can run without issues most of the time.

Ideally if you were interested in letting me run it on your channel, we could get in contact and i would drop in on your stream while it's running and see how the extension behaves, and possibly if its OK ask your viewers for feedback. I would try to be as least disruptive as possible.

As i said before there are nothing but placeholder css elements in lieu of graphics, so it doesn't look good, but it is functional. Here is a link to the original start menu screen i made for the first iteration of this extension (which never made it to completion), just for an idea of what the extension is about. Obv it doesn't look like this right now.

[https://i.imgur.com/x0RsmrI.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/x0RsmrI.gifv)

Please get in contact if you're interested or partial to this at all, i can't promise much in return other than my thanks and making sure when i release your channel is in the first group that can run the app.

If you have any questions please drop them in and i'll reply soon. Thanks!",21,1584002961,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fhdatk/looking_for_testers_for_new_twitch_extension/,Twitch,1

I see some streamers who seem to treat twitch almost like a 9-5 job, they stream regularly and consistently and they put in the hours.

I think r/twitch can implement a similar system but with clips (have a higher minimum to post them). If we have a proper thread for clips posted, people can share their content and **hopefully receive legitimate feedback** on this sub. In addition to prevent some of the really generic, sob story posts, we can enable a minimum of currency in order to post anything **thus encouraging users to contribute quality feedback in comments**.

fh57xm,Ultrafoxx64,Reflecting on my one year streamiversary,"So, last week was my one year anniversary of streaming. I'll be honest, when I first started streaming, my main goal was ""I'm in mountains of vet bill debt after my cat got sick, maybe I can get random people online to give me money for being a cute girl playing video games to help earn some extra money on the side."" I didn't expect that it'd be successful, so worst case scenario, I'd just have a camera on me while I was doing what I'd be doing anyway. I figured I didn't have much to lose and it was a way to set aside more time to play games. 

I was wholly unprepared for what I was actually in store for. The last year I've spent 4 days a week hanging out and making friends with some amazing people. I had no idea that a year later, I'd have a community of people that feel like close friends and a little dysfunctional family that grows together. Some of these people I feel closer to than people I know in real life. It doesn't feel like me randomly blabbering in the camera, it feels like I'm chillin' on the couch with my friends, talking about our days and playing games together (sometimes actually playing games together online.) I have people that talk to me about their mental health struggles, issues that are going on in their lives, and who are there for \*me\* through those things also. One stream, my cat had a seizure while next to me and it really warmed my heart that everyone was checking up on us throughout the night when we rushed off to the vet. It made me feel like it was more real than just watching someone play games.

The other day one of our regulars told us about a cousin that had a seizure and was updating us on her health. That little thing made me feel warm and fuzzy that someone felt comfortable enough to turn to us in sharing that information for support. There are people that have told me they feel welcome being out about being pansexual/trans/gay/etc in my community. There are people that have told me I've been a help to them through mental health struggles. That's such a huge deal to me, it makes me feel like I'm doing something right and for a purpose.

Streaming is so much more rewarding than I ever could have imagined it being. I've gotten some of my real life friends into doing it now, and it always makes me smile when someone in our community decides to start doing it too, and receiving support from others within it without hesitation.

I'm blabbering and not stringing this together as coherent as  I'd like to be, but I just wanted to share my experience with my year. If you've been throwing around the idea of starting a stream, I highly recommend it. I'm sure the majority of people on this subreddit already know how amazing the Twitch community can be, but it really was a new experience for me, and a journey I'm \*so\* glad I took =).",1,1583963892,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fh57xm/reflecting_on_my_one_year_streamiversary/,Twitch,1

fh3gk5,badguyty,Twitch staff should proactively offer colleges a graduation streaming assistance program.,"I know it is a ways out for many colleges still but as the US is starting to feel the impact from the Covid-19 outbreak and I am seeing more and more public gatherings getting canceled, I would hate to see Graduation be canceled for this for any student. Much like sports teams that are playing to empty stadiums Graduations could be the same. With a little preparation now we could make this not only a chance to introduce thousands to this platform we love but also give future graduates the chance to rewatch the graduation in the future. Twitch is the leader in live broadcasts and it only makes sense that they take this opportunity to introduce their service to millions through working with colleges and universities.

Universities could enlist their broadcast and media arts departments now to help prepare for this live event giving vital real world experience. I know that some community run tournaments I have been a part of had very high production quality for the express purpose of honing these skills of their volunteers. It also gave them a very good resume builder.

Just saying this could be a great opportunity not only for Twitch but for the students that may not be Graduating to get real world production experience. This would be a great pitch for Twitch to get University participation at every graduation going forward and further cement their platform as the leader.

It could also open further broadcasting opportunities like sporting events that would not normally command the attention of traditional broadcasting networks. You don't see division 2 or 3 football games regularly broadcast nationally. This would allow schools to see the low cost and educational benefit that could be gained by their students in producing these programs. It could also bring in much needed advertisers to the platform that would not normally cater to the gaming community.

I know that I have seen local card tournaments played out on twitch and this could be a great opportunity for twitch to reach out for a whole new market segment. With a little preparation now and a team to put together a simple ""Graduation starter package"". With some live streamed and recorded getting started with streaming tutorials for things like OBS basics, smoothing out broadcast transitions and scene changes, managing multiple input feeds, and picking/training broadcast hosts.",6,1583957389,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fh3gk5/twitch_staff_should_proactively_offer_colleges_a/,Twitch,1

I know I’m beating a dead horse (from what I’ve googled) and all, but I’m going crazy trying to fix my streaming/Elgato issue...

Long story short: My Ps4 is hooked into my PC/Elgato HD60. While playing/monitoring (playing through Elgato/Streamlabs) my audio slowing goes out of sync...on my monitor I shoot but 0.5 seconds later I hear the shot. 

Now on my recorded stream everything’s perfect. On the gaming monitor I’m playing on, the videos perfect. But the longer I’m streaming, the more “MY”, not the streams, audio goes out of sync. (Shoot... o.5 sec later bang).

I can “deactivate/activate” the Elgato thru streamlabs to correct the issue, but it’ll start again in about 15-20 mins...

This making any sense? It’s strange, no? Can anyone point me in the right direction. Cause all I can find it peoples stream recordings being off...not the actual gameplay on my end.",4,1583952882,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fh28bg/elgato_hd60_ps4_stream/,Twitch,1

fh0xaa,merrymolly16,Seeking Opinions/Advice About Upgrades,"Hey Y'all!

A quick bit of context, I got a generous dono the other night which has allowed me to upgrade some more things with my stream. Ive been streaming since 2015 and I streamed on a MacBook Pro 2012 for 3 of those years- basically I am still a bit new to the PC world. Also I don't really game much anymore sadly but I still want to leave that door open.

**Needs:** 

* Mic - My Blue Snowball ice which I received second hand in 2015 finally called quits last month
   * KET QUESTION: *Should I get a blue yeti nano or a regular blue Yeti? ( I have a tiny desk, my snowball often covered part of my screen)*

**Wants:** 

* Streamdeck  - I basically use my chat bot as a SFX board &gt;.&lt; (yikes I know)
* Elgato Game Capture Card - I recently was gifted a switch (haven't had a console since my PS1/N64) &amp; I'm not sure if I should invest in it?
   * KEY QUESTION: *I don't have a PS or Xbox, although Im sure I can borrow my bfs xbox if I wanted to- basically, is it worth it to invest in this if i'm not even sure if my pre-build pc will work with it?*
* Wireless Headset - I have a CORSAIR VOID PRO headset. I love it BUT its too big. I am a funsized female &amp; the headset is heavy, and bulky. Also I have to clean it all the time because my makeup comes off on the ear pieces.
   * KEY QUESTION: *Does anyone know any FEMALE FRIENDLY headsets? I wear glasses too if that's important. I just feel like every time I look for a wireless headset, they are all extremely big and made for males.* 

**Misc:** 

* Gaming Chair - I get memed because I use a camping chair (I embrace it) but I feel like it makes me look a bit sloppy. Thoughts? 
* Keyboard - I bought a keyboard from Goodwill for $2 and since I don't have a stream deck, I LOVE the fact that it has a sound system control (I can pause/play/skip/mute/ and adjust the volume)

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, I know that's a lot of information but basically what I am asking is what would you recommend I upgrade first as well as what should I upgrade to? I have a limited budget but this information yall give me will help me map out in what order I will upgrade my set up. 

Any information will help!! Thank you :)",7,1583947982,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fh0xaa/seeking_opinionsadvice_about_upgrades/,Twitch,1

fh0jy2,badguyty,Petition for twitch staff to proactively reach out to colleges to offer assistance in setting up streaming graduation services.,"I know it is a ways out for many colleges still but as the US is starting to feel the impact from the Covid-19 outbreak and I am seeing more and more public gatherings getting canceled, I would hate to see Graduation be canceled for this for any student. Much like sports teams that are playing to empty stadiums Graduations could be the same. With a little preparation now we could make this not only a chance to introduce thousands to this platform we love but also give future graduates the chance to rewatch the graduation in the future. Twitch is the leader in live broadcasts and it only makes sense that they take this opportunity to introduce their service to millions through working with colleges and universities.   


Universities could enlist their broadcast and media arts departments now to help prepare for this live event giving vital real world experience. I know that some community run tournaments I have been a part of had very high production quality for the express purpose of honing these skills of their volunteers. It also gave them a very good resume builder.  


Just saying this could be a great opportunity not only for Twitch but for the students that may not be Graduating to get real world production experience. This would be a great pitch for Twitch to get University participation at every graduation going forward and further cement their platform as the leader.  


It could also open further broadcasting opportunities like sporting events that would not normally command the attention of traditional broadcasting networks. You don't see division 2 or 3 football games regularly broadcast nationally. This would allow schools to see the low cost and educational benefit that could be gained by their students in producing these programs. It could also bring in much needed advertisers to the platform that would not normally cater to the gaming community.   


I know that I have seen local card tournaments played out on twitch and this could be a great opportunity for twitch to reach out for a whole new market segment. With a little preparation now and a team to put together a simple ""Graduation starter package"". With some live streamed and recorded getting started with streaming tutorials for things like OBS basics, smoothing out broadcast transitions and scene changes, managing multiple input feeds, and picking/training broadcast hosts.

At the moment I'm not actually streaming what I'm playing - I'm playing Destiny 2 but I'm streaming my Nintendo Switch via Capture Card at the same time. 720p, 30fps, no fancy overlays, no webcam, purely the Switch Gameplay and follower notifications. That's it. 

I know my rig is powerful and shouldn't have issues doing both, but I can't pin-point what the issue is. OBS doesn't mention anything about dropped frames so I'm assuming that means it's a config issue? 

Everyone once in a while I'll notice my mouse jitters in-game and at the same time the stream also gets choppy at the same time, but I don't know what I can do to stop this from happening.

fgxipj,DoctorDaver,How to break the 0 viewer threshold?,"Hey guys,

I've been streaming for about a year, on-and-off.  When I started, I'd routinely get around 7-10 live viewers.  I became affiliated pretty quickly, and had a few subs each month.  Nothing huge, but it was something.

I came back a few months ago, and only had 0 viewers for 3 streams (roughly 3h each in duration).  I thought that my ""fanbase"" had actively decided to show me the same disdain I had given towards them (by taking a break- haha).

Last month I came back for another stream for 6h, and over 6 hours, I only got 1 viewer.  He joined, said hi, and left shortly after.

I stream Rust, primarily.  But it's never been an issue.  I have streamed other games, but I enjoy Rust most... so that's what I stream.

And as for programming/entertainment value, I'm a pretty active guy on stream.

I had created a detailed day by day program like Friday was die-day (die to someone with gear, then try to find their base and wipe them out- or if they're too big, just sabotage their entire base by making their lives as annoying as possible).  Saturday and Sunday were Weekend Warrior days- just general killing).  Funday Sunday where I'd establish a random strategy like avoiding PVP at all costs to only farm stone... and then trade stone for wood in outpost... goofy stuff.  Monday was ""help a noob Monday"" where I'd find some naked newplayer and try to help them.  Tuesday was Loseday where I'd try to use everything I had in preparation for the wipe.  Wednesday was humpday- every kill needed to crouch a few times on every corpse I generated... and then Thursday was typically an off day because that was wipe day.

I dunno, maybe not a perfect format, but each day I had a goal and some entertainment planned.

Most of the time a new viewer joined, I'd be able to interact in some way.  They'd typically stay and I figured I'd slowly build my base.

My issue is that I can't get out of 0 viewer hell.  I'm not sure which Twitch God I've bothered, but if anyone has suggestions... please let me know.

I did pay some guy on fiverr $20 that said he was going to promote my stream- but all he did was send a bunch of bots to follow me.  They'd join one at a time say, ""Hey, great to see you playing Rust.  Alright, I have to go- see you soon!""

fgu55g,vilgefartz,Looking for testers for new Extension,"Hi all.

I'm developing a Twitch Extension that i'd like to publish, but i need test my code and server a bit to make sure they can hold up. 

The game itself is a multiplayer scissors paper rock, that runs on a single thread. Which means there will only be one game running at a time per channel, and if you're not a player, you're a spectator. The idea to present it as either a component overlay, or a video overlay, depending on your preferences. Once the programming is mostly done, the game will look like a retro arcade fighter, with various characters, health bars, high-scores etc. It doesn't have any graphics at the moment, because i'm still trying to find an artist i can hire to do it in the style i'd like. 

**The testing**

Even though the extension is in development, i can still permit particular channels to load the extension and use it. What i'd like to find is multiple streamers with at least a couple of viewers who would use the extension. I'm looking to find some edge cases where the app/server breaks, and to fix them so it can run without issues most of the time. 

Ideally if you were interested in letting me run it on your channel, we could get in contact and i would drop in on your stream while it's running and see how the extension behaves, and possibly if its OK ask your viewers for feedback. I would try to be as least disruptive as possible.

As i said before there are nothing but placeholder css elements in lieu of graphics, so it doesn't look good, but it is functional. Here is a link to the original start menu screen i made for the first iteration of this extension (which never made it to completion), just for an idea of what the extension is about. Obv it doesn't look like this right now.

[https://i.imgur.com/x0RsmrI.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/x0RsmrI.gifv)

Please get in contact if you're interested or partial to this at all, i can't promise much in return other than my thanks and making sure when i release your channel is in the first group that can run the app.

Now - I won't be making a site on this specific content (above) - but it is just an example of the types of notes I may take when on a website for later use. Also note that on the site described above I could not find any of their own sources/or citations for the statistics and other facts mentioned. Are these? And other research topics such as:

a coding reference site,

a site on the basic symptoms of schizophrenia,

or a site about color theory and design, 

Where the information is common to the field, and found readily on many different resources web and print types of information that need to be sourced/cited   (not source code) ?   

If so - how should this be done outside of hyperlinking (takes too much time, and clutters the content- also can be seen as spamming if done in abundance? maybe?)

Should I just list a page with a lot of url's I have visited (pulled from browser history)?

Should I post a disclaimer telling other websites to contact me if they have issues to be resolved and information on how to avoid them in the future?

Should I just roll with it until somebody contacts me if they have an issue?

Should I include the links but hide them neatly into comments within my HTML indexes?

I've been all over Google, and YouTube, tried a few chatroom - all with no look and most information regarding copyright or sourcing is geared towards academia.   
Or I'll type ""source/cite"" and it will return information about source code files - Not the goal there.   Anybody with specific knowledge? Experience? Or just overall general opinions - please comment and help. Thanks.

Yo. :D,

So I've got this problem. I'm gonna start streaming Dark Souls 3 tomorrow for the first time. It's gonna be Drunk Souls. I'm really looking forward to it.

Now the thing is, it's not gonna be just an ordinary Drunk Souls. It's gonna include challenges from the viewers. Stuff like ""you choose my weapon for the next 20 minutes"", or ""fists only for the next 15 minutes"", or even something crazy like ""playing upside down for 15 minutes"".

The drinking part of the game is probably gonna be -sip/sips for every death -sip/sips for every heal used -sip/sips for every follow.

I don't have many viewers (not affiliate yet), for drunken streams some show up tho (plus you never know if any new people show up), and until now these type of streams have been tons of fun (that's also why I want to include viewers in on the fun aswell). The people that do show up, are definitely not gonna be paying for the challenges. So I'm looking for a different way of incorporating said viewer challenges into the stream. Only thing that I think of is do something on a follow, but it already has a ""take a sip/sips"". What do you think? Any ideas?

In the coming week I plan on bring my stream back, I've recently left school and begun studies which mainly contain online research, so I have plenty spare time during school hours so I feel this might be a fun experience, that got me thinking about the very low but possible chance of streaming being a profession.

&amp;#x200B;

fgmzkd,starryrz,Looking To Start A Best Twitch Clips Of The Week Show,"The title sums it up. I have been streaming on Twitch for 2 years and in the process have met so many other great streamers. I'm hoping to launch this show to showcase amazing streamers not many people may have heard of, and also to be a place go get live feedback from a live audience. Each episode would feature a 24 clip bracket and Twitch chat would vote until the best clip won.

My questions are 1. Is this something people would be interested watching? 2. Is putting the channel name on the screen enough or is there anything else I did to do to give proper credit to the streamers featured?, 3. What would be a good name for this show?, and 4.

I was curious why, and the moderators said the post ""intended to get clicks on a video/channel"". That was totally not my intention. I was sharing advice because, honestly, a lot of streamers have poor quality streams and I want to get content in their face that will help them improve their stream.

I messaged the mods a month later (yesterday), asking to share a video I made on how to use Voicemeeter with OBS (which is a great QOL improvement IMO).

Same thing. ""You cannot share a video with the intention to get clicks.""

The only way to link a video like that is to write out a whole entire text guide and then link it at the bottom. What? So you're telling me that I should compile this complex program into a text guide that is much harder to follow? No way.

It seems like a lot of people have subscriber perks, that include off-website perks (like Discord roles, etc.). Are there any rules on subscriber perks we're allowed to advertise on our channel? I've seen people offer like social media websites and stuff for them. Is that okay? Is there anything that I'm not allowed to offer as a sub perk?

And what about bits and donations? The rules on incentives for these seem incredibly confusing. I had assumed donations would be more open since its off website, yet it doesn't seem like it. Yet, we can offer all kinds of stuff for subs which are being paid through Twitch? Doesn't make sense to me. Twitch says nothing that can be considered ""value"" may be offered in return, but it doesn't do a good job at explaining what. 

I'm at the point where I'm probably not even going to offer incentives because this shit is too confusing and I don't want to get banned.",3,1583878354,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fgm5z1/confused_on_what_i_can_offer_for_perks_incentives/,Twitch,1

I am a new streamer and have made a few other new friends on Twitch and have been asked a few times how many channel points I have made in X days. Instead of guessing I decided to make a spreadsheet that calculates based on user type, hours streamed, and other bonuses that may apply.

Here is a link to my one drive with the file in it. I do have the cells locked to keep them from being eddited on accident. I know there is a rule against posting links and shortend links but this is what one drive gave me and I feel that others would benefit from this.

fgltaq,FCoin,What not to do while trying to grow,"I see a lot of streamers new or otherwise with smaller channels bouncing in to channels that have 20-70 viewers clumsily forcing the fact they are also a streamer into the conversation two minutes after joining the channel. If you do this and you think you are being subtle you are not and this is why it's hurting you.

1. Streamers of that size don't care that you are doing this. Go figure a lot of streamers like talking about streaming. The people who do care are the viewers. What they think when you do this isn't ""oh this guys streams too I'm going to check them out."" It's ""cringe this person is trying to viewer chase and capitalise on the work a person I like has done. They aren't going to care about me as a person."" You have just put a sour taste in the mouths of the people you are actually trying to impress

2. Channels of this size are full of fellow streamers. They are there supporting each other and helping each other build a real community of friends. You are not special because you stream and all you are doing is ""look at me, look at me"" amongst your peers. Only ever mention you stream if asked directly to do so.

So what should you do instead? Invest time in channels you genuinely like. Become a part of their community. Make actual friends then they will want to come and support and talk to you because they already know you. Because they have invested in a relationship with you they are also more likely to overlook poor mic quality or some dropped frames because they want to support you.

I know stuff like this has been said before but as the number of streamers is ever growing I think it's important to reiterate the right way to connect with people in the community.",21,1583877084,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fgltaq/what_not_to_do_while_trying_to_grow/,Twitch,1

I'm a bit confused about the types of visas out there for travel/work within the U.S. as a Canadian citizen. I'm not a visa holder, and I understand that as a Canadian I'm allowed to be in the U.S. for up to 6 months within a calendar year according to IRS rules, and up to 6 months within a 12-month rolling period according to immigration rules.

I'll be visiting my significant other in the U.S. and touring around for about four months. While my purpose of visiting is mostly for pleasure, I do, however, plan on continuing my Twitch stream while in the States. I know other Canadian streamers have done this in the past, but I'm unsure if those streamers had to pay taxes on the income (Twitch revenue and donations) to the IRS.

fgewhf,Zhadow46,Serious About Streaming? Try This!,"Are you serious about making it as a streamer? Well there’s one thing you can realize, to not beat around the bush, that thing is: 

Interact with other people

“Wow that’s not useful”. Well just hear me out. I don’t mean chat. And speaking to chat. I mean actually speak with other people while doing whatever you are doing. If you are a gaming streamer (who isn’t tbh) then find other streamers that look cool and stream the same kinda stuff and play the game with them and create a friendship. This mashes you’re viewers together, makes you a friend and makes you more entertaining to watch. 

Also, realize that twitch is so friggin over saturated with gamers. You HAVE to be different if you want to increase your chances of succeeding. Best way to do this is create an array of personalities. Having other people creates more dynamic content. Which makes things more fun to watch. 


Or you can continue to play video games while live and do nothing different than hundreds of thousands of streamers every second of the day. Good luck.",4,1583851542,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fgewhf/serious_about_streaming_try_this/,Twitch,1

fgehaz,the_Valkiriya,Work on your self respect if you plan to stream,"We all know that streaming means you might get the occasional troll. I am sure some of you have experienced multiple trolls at once, and/or the trolls making new accounts over and over again so that they can come and disturb your stream.

A few weeks ago I talked a streamer named Bittie (please check her out, she's a sweetheart), and I vented to her about this man that had been upsetting me. He randomly came into my stream during a 24hr one, and he gifted a few dozen subs and donated, I believe, around 50$ over the course of a few days. However, very suddenly, he began to be irritable and rude. He accused me of the weirdest things such as paying for followers when I got follow botted. He was very demanding and self-righteous, thinking that I owed him something because he had spent so much money on me. After about 1½ weeks since he first joined the stream, I blocked and banned him.

When I spoke with Bittie, she said this: **""You will have many people like that. It's not worth the abuse or manipulation.""**

She also warned me that some people like that might have them charge their donations back.

This made me realize that there are a lot of shitty people and creeps out there. I am a small streamer yet I've encountered several creepy people like him. Some who would constantly message me, be flirtatious, call my voice sexy. Fortunately, I have yet to have been harassed or even stalked, but I know that a lot of streamers have.

As a girl, I realize that the probability of me getting creepy viewers like that is higher than for guys, but creeps can be any gender and directed at anyone, which is why I am making this post.

My point is that if you do not understand your self worth, and if you do not respect yourself, you might encounter people like that and not understand that how they treat you isn't okay. Being a streamer does require a bit of thick skin so if you're a sensitive person, I'd recommend working on that for a bit until you feel strong enough to venture out into a platform where you can be harassed, scammed and, of course, made uncomfortable. And have good mods. 

Lastly, I'd recommend having a community, which can still be your Twitch community, that'll be there for you if shitty people ever start appearing in your stream.",1,1583849820,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fgehaz/work_on_your_self_respect_if_you_plan_to_stream/,Twitch,1

Seeing that people almost look at it almost immediately as a new viewer just to ask ""Really? Getting you to swear is worth 1m points? Why?""

Oh I don't swear on stream.

""Say no more."" Seeing that has just been equally entertaining, and it adds more content with increased talking points on stream.

I was curious if other people thought of channel points as a benefit. I know some people are just against it and just deactivated as soon as it became available. Some feel like it just distracts viewers from content on stream. Interaction just revolves around channel points.

I was browsing this thread for a while and couldn't find an answer to that so please let me ask: What's the worst a (Twitch-)Mod can/could do?

Why am I asking this: I was streamin a Beat-Em Up the other day and a (new/random) viewer asked me: ""Hey wanna bet 100$ vs Twitch-Mod rights"" that i can beat you? I refused that bet completely but it made me think:

1.  What's the worst that could happen if a stranger (worst case, person with bad intention) was a mod in your stream?

2. I've also seen that there are streamers out there that offer ""(Twitch-)Mod for a day"" for channel points. Would you recommend this?

3. Storytime: What's the worst thing your Mods ever did to you? (Would be happy for some entertainin stories)

fgd41i,Kend0za,Need advice on choosing a name/brand,"Hi all!   
So, I've had the online name/nickname ""Kendoza"" for a while and I've been thinking about changing it/re-branding. 

I've been Kendoza\_ / Kend0za on Twitch for a while since Kendoza is taken, and that caused a lot of confusion for my subscribers from YouTube typing my link, or username and ending up at the wrong channel making it hard for me to transition from YouTuber to Twitch streamer. (Happened way too many times)

I'm really hoping to stream and showcase my above average aim when Project A / Valorant releases so I think it'd possibly be a good time to re-brand.

So, I thought of using a name that I've liked going by as a secondary nickname or online persona which is ""Shy.""  
Since Project A / Valorant is going to be a BRAND new game, I might be able to take the name Shy in game and possibly re-brand to something like ""Shyfromthesix"" until I get verified and can possibly take the inactive name ""Shy.""

I'm thinking about the long term, and if Shy sounds like a brand name I could build around that'd be great. It's easier to pronounce than Kendoza since it's only one syllable compared to three and it has some meaning to me because I'm an introvert but video games has helped me make life-long friends.

he then asked where I was from, to which I told him the US state I was from. (not the city or anything too specific) 

then the following question really put me in an uneasy place, he asked, “do you have any weapons at home?” Literally verbatim

I know it’s nothing that I should be worrying about, because there’s literally no way he would know my full name, or my address, but I still think about it because it was a really weird thing to ask

I didn’t answer his question, in fact I literally said “I’m not going to answer that question” not in a mean way or anything, I kind of said it jokingly and then continued about my stream making jokes at the content

ummm so I guess my question is, has anyone encountered this before?

I know what most of you guys are thinking, ""Why don't you just stick with Kendoza?"" The issue I have is that I literally CAN'T get that exact name on socials, and am forced to add something like a zero to my name. I know if I make it far enough to get verified on Twitch, I get to claim an inactive name but the guy using [twitch.tv/Kendoza](https://twitch.tv/Kendoza) is still active and streams every now and then so I'd be stuck with an altered name. What I've been noticing for the past few months is that ""Shy"" is either an inactive account or a banned account which means it could be claimed once if I were to get verified. There are streamers out there with generic but simple names like Myth, Shroud or Ninja, but there are also streamers out there with unique names like Pokimane or DrLupo.

fgcp15,omryo,"I think many people who struggle on Twitch is actually struggling with ""awareness""","I've been a silent reader for a year now in this subreddit and found many great resources to improve your Twitch journey, also reading so many complaints about struggling to ""make it"".

I read one comment on [u/Eyesaaaac](https://www.reddit.com/user/Eyesaaaac) thread about struggling to continue streaming because of no interaction, 0 viewers, and demotivated because of it.

Here is the thing. I think we have to become more aware of our initial expectations and purposes; why you streaming on Twitch in the first place, and what is your goal.

Is it to make it on Twitch? Then strategize your plans, improve yourself as a streamer, improve your networking skills and do it, search and implement resources in this subreddit that are free and comprehensive. For example [Marketing resources by u/TeaHands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/chqavu/marketing_resources_for_streamers/), [u/nalvara\_ 's one year experience of streaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/eledve/what_ive_learned_after_1_year_of_streaming/), [Networking advice from u/TheOutlier1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/aidlr1/guide_6_steps_to_improving_your_twitch_networking/), and many more.

Is it just looking for friends with the same games to play and humor? Then please do it.

By becoming aware of your purposes and managing your expectations, then you can proceed to do your plans and reach your goals. To make it on Twitch or any media as an entertainer, in general, is hard. If you really want to make it then you need to dedicate your time on it; even by doing that, the failure percentage is still there, never mind just press the live button and hoping the world to be in your favor.     
Whatever your purposes are, the only advice that I can give is to enjoy the journey, enjoy the process. If later you find it not fun anymore, then stop. If after that you get that itch to try it again then I'm cheering for you.

I hope the best luck for all of you, and please keep this community as supportive as now!",120,1583841597,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fgcp15/i_think_many_people_who_struggle_on_twitch_is/,Twitch,1

Last month I decided to take up Twitch and play games because I really enjoy playing them. But my anxiety is holding me back. I try to push myself to stream but the whole stream be me playing the game and being too nervous to talk to my viewers. You have to be entertaining to reel in viewers and I want to be comfortable and make people laugh and smile but as soon as someone says hi or comment about the game I get stuck and dont say anything or stutter and that makes my viewers leave. I really do try to talk to my viewers but it don't work out and I'm starting to believe that Twitch just isn't for me.,27,1583831938,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fgb24b/a_streamer_with_anxiety_who_wants_to_quit/,Twitch,1

fg9t2a,ourheavenlyfodder,Streaming Switch With a Third Party Dock?,"I'm interested in streaming from the Switch, but only have one dock. I use the Switch in my living room for Ring Fit Adventure (which I have NO interest in streaming, lol). I stream from my bedroom office. 

So it seems like the most practical solution would be to get a second dock. Except a new licensed Nintendo dock runs $189, which is absurd. For $10 more I could get a complete Switch Lite. So at the very least I'd need to go a used/refurbished route, but even that runs at $80 or more. I am not a person of means, and the capture card for this would already be a significant splurge for me. 

I know there are lots of third-party docks out there that are much cheaper. As low as $25. I also know there was a notorious problem with third party docks bricking consoles. And I've heard some of the third party docks aren't great for streaming in some of their amazon reviews. In some ways, if I could be confident they would work, the third party docks would be preferable just for being smaller, even without the savings, but obviously that's not gonna be worth it if it's not going to work.

I know the Skull &amp; Co. dock is well-reviewed and seems to be functional. Does it work with streaming/capture cards? I also don't have a capture card yet, so is the capture card I get a consideration with the dock I get, like is there any reason one dock or another might be more suited to a specific capture card?

This would be expensive, so I'm weighing the pros and cons. I would REALLY love to stream Animal Crossing daily when it comes out, but if I have to spend $300 or more to even have the option, it's probably not worth it, as my stream is small and barely makes any money. So if anyone has any insights on third party docks and streaming, I'd love to hear them.",3,1583823506,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fg9t2a/streaming_switch_with_a_third_party_dock/,Twitch,1
fg9iyb,wandering_cat_ninja,School project to develop a Twitch extension - any good ideas?,"I've got a school project to come up with an idea for a Twitch extension. 
I've only been a viewer on Twitch streams and don't really know much beyond that. 

My understanding is that revenue for the developer can be obtained when a viewer uses the extension, paying in bits. The bit revenue is shared with the channel owner. 

Is this about right?

Someone mentioned that a Twitch loyalty points ranking extension isn't really possible as dev's cannot access to Channel points. That would be a cool idea. 

My idea isn't quite as good as that. Really just a bits donation that will also contribute to carbon offsetting by planting a tree. The rationale is that streaming actually has a decent carbon footprint and some streamers might want to offset this.

I'm assuming a dual-condenser mic setup is our best bet, since I can't afford to mic each person individually. But in a dual-mic setup, how do I keep one mic from leaking into the other? Should I just purchase a second Snowball and try to angle them in a good enough way (perhaps one pointed straight at the DM and one pointed in the general direction of the players) to keep them separated?

I have a Mackie ProFX8 Mixer and a pair of dynamic mics, but I've been getting better results with the Snowball plugged directly into the streaming computer.

fg3yhf,capitaovolupia,Do I get the HD60s+ or invest in a camlink?,"Hi guys,

(I am not sure if this goes as tech support or discussion)

I need a bit of advice. I currently have a nice desktop in which I use to game and record gameplay from consoles using my Elgato 60s. I have a DSLR but currently I use it on Streamlabs by cropping the live view window from Canon Utilities. I wanted to get the elgato camlink for a smoother capture.

But, recently I saw the elgato 60s+ and also the Razer external card. So I was thinking if I should still get the cam link or just upgrade my card and use my old capture card for the camera.

I do not want to buy a new Desktop to do 2-pc streaming or an internal capture card yet, but I do plan in the future to get a gaming laptop (since I travel a lot to visit my family) and probably use it on a 2pc recording/streaming setup when I am home and playing pc games. 

Note: I usually play at 1440p (so maybe the 60+ helps here? Or does it not support this resolution as “pass through”? It's not listed, but even if it does not work I could still use it for my PS4 pro).

If this makes a difference: My current desktop has 1080ti, 8th gen i7, 16gb of ram.

I am just thinking on the long run.
In my research, i've heard of higher delays with the camlink dongle, but also of problems while using two external capture cards at the same time.

I am open to suggestions and sharing personal experiences.

fg3rkg,Bccloosecannon,"Playstation Camera, Native Streaming &amp; Chroma Key Troubleshooting.","Heya Twitch Reddit, Hope you can help on this one.

Some incredibly generous viewers of my community purchased me a green screen to improve my stream quality. After an initial PC test with streamlabs OBS (which went swimmingly) I tried to use the Chroma Setting on the Playstation camera. (since I dont always stream from the same spot)

As you can see from the Image in the link provided, I would be fine when the camera kicks on for a few seconds, but then the chroma would only partially grain the green screen. Moving its slider settings did not change anything other than the shadows around me.

I've restarted the stream, powercycled the PS4, removed and replaced the camera, rebuilt the database, tried different rooms with different lighting. Nothing worked. A friend brought over to a new model playstation camera and it happened again, but it occurred to me my seat cushion was blue. As you can see bringing it into the camera shot blue chroma is working fine, but green gives me that weird grain.

Outside of the settings I've found in the playstation, I'm at a total loss here. Does anyone know what is happening here and how I can fix this? I don't see any option to choose between blue or green chroma. Almost every youtube video I've found has a green screen, but doesn't address this issue so if you have any ideas I'm all ears. :(

ffxspk,zombiefaace,How I fixed my Apex Legends crashing [PC],"[How to fix Apex Legends crashing PC 2020](https://youtu.be/k1WFYrOKg3U)

So I made this video after experiencing some crashing on the latest Nvidia drivers from 02-27-2020, version 442.50. I found a fix by downgrading my drivers to version 436.51. This is my process to downgrade my drivers and I hope it helps anyone who was experiencing the same issue as me.

As of this post I've played for a few hours with no crashing. If you're going to downgrade I always recommend using the 3rd party app Display Driver Uninstaller first as it'll do a factor removal and should avoid issues from installing over another driver. Let me know if this works for you!

The steps are below:  
1.) Check your Nvidia driver version to see if you need to upgrade/downgrade.  
2.) Reboot into Safe Mode with Networking.  
3.) Run Display Driver Uninstaller to factory uninstall GPU drivers.  
4.) Install Nvidia Driver Version 436.51  
5.) Reboot and play Apex Legends!",2,1583773208,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ffxspk/how_i_fixed_my_apex_legends_crashing_pc/,Twitch,1

I was told that streaming to 0 people was depressing, that I would be desperately clawing at anyone who joins to stay, trying to engage them in a conversation that would just seem pathetic. To get a viewing, I was told I needed to start making content on YouTube, and hope that following would follow me to Twitch as well. The marker for viewers was 10, because then it wouldn't be me ""playing by myself hoping someone will watch.""

I'm glad to report that's not the case. I started streaming on Twitch in my dorm room to 0 viewers, playing a game I loved which kept me going. I found some amazing people who are now regulars, and have stood by me and joined my streams even if it's for a game they don't like. I love their company and it's evident they enjoy mine. 

I don't have the 10 concurrent viewers per stream that I was told was necessary, but my chat is active and that's all that I wanted. I joined Twitch so I could make friends and create an inclusive community that I can have a laugh with.

I asked the person who I bought the logo from if I could get sub badges from it (all they would have to do was some simple changes to colors and stuff) but they said all (or most can’t remember) of there files/art had been corrupted so the logo was gone. He asked me to send him the png file (I have not paid for the sub badges yet). It’s probably just my paranoid self, but it all seems kinda suspicious.

i can run vanilla obs  at like 2% cpu but for some reason the stream keeps freezing for other people it looks fine to me but people keep saying video is freezing and audio is still going all my video and encoder setting are the same as my stream labs so it really makes no sense to me

ffukmm,cafrostwolf,Need app advice from you beauties!,"Hey there troops!

So this is my first time posting here, hi i'm CAFrostwolf on TTV, I have been streaming for a year now, and made affiliate maybe 6-7 months ago!
I want to improve the quality of my streams and I have already upgraded my computer to run newer games or better graphics.

But now i'm at the part where I need to improve the little things.
So my question to all of you bet streamers is what is the app or an app that you use to stop/reduce surrounding sound? I have a baby that is very talktative and a wife that watches tv (as I stream from the living room) and was wondering if there was an app to cut out the sound. Whether its paid or not, just any suggestion would help thanks!

P.S. Also, if you have ANY OTHER app suggestions, I am all ears!

ffuhip,Kaomii22,"No matter what I do, I'm screwed","I don't really know if it's the right subreddit for this but since it's twitch related I'll give it a try

I usually go around 7-11 viewers I have a very tiny yet very supportive community, 90+% of viewers are chatters and we welcome warlmy newcomers that chats with lots of gg's and give love for those who needs it, we raid people and basically spread love everywhere we can, one day a girl came to the stream saying she was bullied at school for over a year, we gave her lots of love, fuck it even gave her mod and a higher rank than me (the streamer) on discord, she took so much love she literally cried and this night we all went to bed happy, the next day she reached out to adults for help. Then my anxiety fucked up.

My first girlfriend, I stayed with her for over a year and got separated, she was pure toxicity to me, every two weeks there was something that would literally destroy me, i discovered she was raped, and that it destroyed her, but she's still hanging out with the guy like it's normal, and stuff like that, for a first love full of anxiety it just destroyed me. (She cared so little about her she wouldn't shower or brush her teeths, she wouldn't care being Injured or even die, and i cared a lot, it destroyed me seeing her destroying herself piece by piece so I ended this) 

The girl from the stream reminded my first girlfriend minus the self destructive behaviour and not a while ago I lost my last girlfriend, I fell a big void in my heart, and i feel like the girl I've met on stream is just making the void deeper, I just don't want her in the chat or the discord,but she did absolutely nothing wrong but remind me horrible times by accident, the void I feel by my girlfriend leaving me is sure bad timing, I love spreading love, but there is something here that destroys me, i could just ban her hut she's a part of the community and she did nothing wrong so now I'm just stuck and literally just don't wanna Stream anymore.

TL;DR : Girl remind me of my first girlfriend in chat, anxiety destroys me because of that, I just don't wanna have her on stream anymore but she did nothing wrong I can't ban her plus she's part of the community",9,1583759785,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ffuhip/no_matter_what_i_do_im_screwed/,Twitch,1

fftq07,AutoModerator,Monthly Channel Feedback Thread: REVIEW BEFORE YOU POST!,"###READ THE POST GUIDELINES BEFORE POSTING.  

It's been a month since we've had one of these threads, so it's time to open a new one!

 Feel free to post a screenshot and link to your page for review of your stream. Please also review as many others as you can so that everyone gets some much desired feedback!  

**Here's how it works:**  

In giving thoughtful detailed advice for other streamers, observe their channel as both a viewer and a fellow streamer. **Once you have posted your reviews to other people**, post a direct reply to this thread (so it's not embedded in other reply strings), **post your channel link, a link to a Clip, and a screenshot of your overlay** and wait for your feedback.  

Consider and give comments on aspects such as:  

* how your peers brand themselves overall  

* overlay layout/webcam placement and sizing  

* layout of their info area   

* how they handle chat interaction (look at their VOD if they are not live when you review them)  

* video quality  

* audio quality  

* the games they choose  

* features they have or perhaps lack that you think would be useful for them anything else you can think of  

There are a few caveats. First - this is going to be an honest review of what you are currently offering as your stream. Be honest, be open, and be respectful. It might be negative and it might be positive. Understand you are asking for the truth; flattery might feel nice, but it will not help you grow.  

That said, you might have a clear vision for a certain aspect that perhaps someone else does not see - just because what you do doesn't appeal to some, if you like it, then take what they say with a grain of salt. Don't forget your own instincts or lose yourself in the views of others.  

Also, we will remove posts of people who are clearly only looking to receive (those who post their channel for feedback but do not offer a real review of another) so please help this community. We are a network!  

Based on community feedback, the mod team have decided to hold one of these threads on the second Monday of every month.

###REMEMBER: Review OTHER streamers BEFORE asking others to review yours! Users failing to do this will have their comments REMOVED. Sort by 'NEW' to find the un-reviewed comments, there is no harm in reviewing someone's stream if they have been reviewed by someone else, but PLEASE REVIEW UN-REVIEWED STREAMS FIRST. The more feedback the better! We're all here to help each other!",118,1583755967,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fftq07/monthly_channel_feedback_thread_review_before_you/,Twitch,1

ffsqqj,myDahlia,The Problem I Face When Trying To Stream,"Hey Guys,

I suffer relatively moderate anxiety and I love streaming. Mid last year around April, I streamed consistently for quite a while but with life getting in the way I had to stop.

I've decided to get the stream back up and running except I keep encountering a new hurdle. Every time I'm about to start streaming I encounter a panic attack that I believe it is triggered by the thought of being alone during the stream i.e. no viewers. I always make sure that I have a friend or two watching the stream but at the end of the day they are there cause they want to support me not because they stumbled upon my stream. 

When I'm about to click ""Start Streaming"", I usually end up thinking about the stream and the fact that when it finishes, there is a high chance the viewership will just be the friends that you asked to be there. This then goes on and messes with my head and the rest you can gather - I sit there staring at my screen, until it's too late for me to stream resulting in me just turning off the computer. I made the decision to start streaming at the start of March and in the past 9 days, I've only managed to stream once. 

There's quite a lot of people here so I'm making this post in the hope that there's someone else out there who also goes through the same thing but hopefully has found a way to get over it.

ffpej3,darxide23,Community gift sub bug?,"So I was gifted a sub to a favorite channel two months ago. It expired and I've been sure I'd catch another one soon because of the huge number of gift subs dropped in this stream every day. It's now been a full month and I've watched a 10 gift sub bomb go to people who were not in the chat at the time. I've been in streams with 300 viewers and seen a couple 100 sub bombs go by with nothing and then being the only person without a sub badge all night long.

Now I'm not complaining about not getting a gift sub. Shit happens. I'm not a choosing beggar. But it's got me wondering if maybe there's a bug in the system. I say this because I noticed something tonight.

If I go up to my notifications I can see where I was gifted the sub 2 months ago, but it never says the sub expired. Other channels where I've gotten a sub I then see the sub expire a month later. In these channels, I've gotten additional gift subs after the previous one expires.

But in this one channel where there was never a notification that my sub expired, I can't get another gift sub and they go to people who aren't even online at the time instead. I wonder if the gift sub system thinks I'm still subscribed when I'm not because it never sent an expiration notification. Anyone else noticed something like this happening?

With all that said, I've got no idea if a targeted gift sub would go through to me or not. I'll have to wait to see if I win a sub from the streamer (through marbles or a sub wheel spin or whatever else.) Will be interesting to see.",3,1583729035,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ffpej3/community_gift_sub_bug/,Twitch,1

I used mixer for like a week and a half but kept getting errors from microsoft. Non the less i ventured over to the more populated site twitch.tv to begin my streaming adventure.

Apart of me starting it though ""ah who cares, ill just have it running idc if anything happens"" but you hope, you do the research and get what you can in equipment. But still when most nights are spent with ""1 viewer"" which is just you with your browser open. It gets discouraging seeing tweets and insta posts get a few like and retweets buy nothing comes from it on stream.
Networking is a big part and challenging which makes it hard not to throw your link on every damn thing... Twitch.tv/pulseofxistence ... i digress. You put this effort forward trying to prove your personality but when nobody can find you and your just 1 in a million hashtags it starts to feel like nobody showed up for your birthday party. 

I was the type that thought dreams of a career in content creation and video games was a childish dream, im 25 and work full time and just figure... ""whats the harm in dreaming, whats wrong with saying it out loud and just going for it""

ffnbyb,Doggpickle,Twitch Viewing is really skippy and terrible all the time,"Hi Guys. I tried to search and find any related posts so that I wouldn't make a duplicate, but I couldn't find anything newer than 2018 and nothing super relevant.

I run my TV off of a Surface 3, so there are already bottlenecks inherent in that, but I DON'T think that is what is causing my problems. My internet is NOT super fast though. It should be, but I've noticed my FIOS does tend to wave up and down a bit (and I'm moving within the year so I'm not gonna fix what isn't broken)

I can watch 1080p Youtube or Netflix or Amazon Video for days straight with no problems or even stutters, (I don't even restart my Surface for weeks sometimes) but for some reason, I can't ever watch Twitch even at 720 or even 480 without constant rebuffering, skipping etc. Sometimes I have to restart my whole computer because it feels like it builds up some kind of trash that slows everything down to a crawl. I've tried it with Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

 I just don't get it. How can I watch 12 hours straight of 1080p youtube, but 480 twitch just murders my whole computer and won't work. I was trying to watch some Rimworld today and that particularly doesn't work very well in low-rez.

I do have an actual nice desktop replacement Laptop that I use for gaming (I travel a lot so I can't have a tower) so I have that for testing, but I try to keep it off the internet unless absolutely necessary.

I am a fairly new streamer and I stream League of Legends as my title says. I use Twitch Studio Beta to stream instead of OBS because it was an easy and quick way to start streaming; however, I have noticed that when I do stream I ""lag"" in game. The weird part is that its not ""typical"" lag because my ping is fine, and I can still play the game properly. When the ""lag"" randomly happens, it effects my gameplay when I use a spell. For example, I was in a fight and pressed an ability and a summoner spell, but it did not cast because of the ""lag"" and I died. However, when I revived, the game automatically casted the two abilities way after I initially pressed it. If I am not streaming, I have never had this issue before.

ffk3v2,AdamHartGaming,This one thought will bring you a community," Sometimes when people find out I make content, they say things to hurt me. 

A long time ago I remember being on a school bus going somewhere for a field trip. This one guy found out I had a YouTube channel and his response was: “If I did YouTube, I’d have way more subscribers than you.” 

He just laughed and that was the conversation. He grinned really wide and him and his braces looked out the window. He seemed to feel really good about himself, putting me down. I didn’t say anything. I can’t remember exactly how I felt, but I was taken aback with his comment. He was one of those people that you knew from class and were an acquaintance with, and you think you’re on good terms, but then you realize they’re not very nice.

I did remember one thing from that day however. I thought: at least I’m trying. And that’s more than he can say. That’s why I didn’t feel like I had to say anything, because I didn’t. 

What does this have to do with twitch? I just recently started. I’m sure I’ll get the same comment again some day about it. I’ve already encountered negative remarks about my potential after banning people. Just like my YouTube channel, at least I’m trying. And by trying, I may not be a huge streamer, but I have a community that cares about me. That’s what you’re really looking for.

To wherever is reading this, just trying will bring you the change you want in your life.

Just trying will bring you a community. Even very small groups can be considered a community.

I wrote this while recovering from surgery. My life isn’t the greatest right now but one thing is for sure. Your life won’t get any better just trying to achieve a number. It’s what happens along the way and your relationship with yourself and other people.

ffipay,georgehopkinsiscool,My issues with twitch as a small streamer.,"I've been a streamer for quite a while, roughly two years provided my internet didn't drop 90+% of frames. Throughout my time as a streamer I've learned the same lesson over and over again but still wanted to give it a go because I enjoy streaming. At least, when it works.

As a small streamer on twitch, you are at the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the list in any and every game. You must play unpopular games for anyone to find you. I do that, but without social credit nobody watches. Many times someone would pop in ""why are you talking to yourself?"" - Simple, because I don't want to just sit there and gape my mouth open at the screen and wait for things to happen to me. 

Popular streamers perplex me. They can sit there, stare at a video someone paid them $20 to watch for about 2 minutes, not commentate or react, and then go back to playing their game like it never even happened to the amusement of thousands of people spamming pogchamp and pepega. There's no interaction there, and any attempt at interaction is met with pepega and pogchamp spam. These streamers literally NEED the paywall for interaction, which I understand with that many people, but most of them are boring and drier than a tinder prostitute. 

Twitch before 20 viewers is a really awful numbers game of having just enough views to brigade a small community and hope they like you. Twitch after 20 viewers you have some level of discovery, and some ability for outreach on games you want to play. At this point, you can be carried by genuinely good personality and interaction with chat. This is where I want to be, where it actually does matter how good my stream is. I see people streaming to 20+ viewers with no cam, no streamlabs setup, and not even talking to chat and it blows my mind how that does better than some people who try much harder.

I am aware this is a pessimistic and potentially very pissbitchy viewpoint, but it really does feel like no matter how hard I try to make interaction, I'll fall flat for not having viewership in the first place. I want to be able to do things which include the audience but those things don't work without a few chatters, much less with absolutely nobody. 

Are there ways to overcome 0-20 viewer purgatory? How can I incentivize chat interaction that is worthwhile? How can I maintain that viewership? And how do I overcome the numbers game of twitch so I can play what I actually want to play or do what I actually want to do. 

I care deeply about twitch and about running a good stream as much as possible, but I feel like I'm having to do things that aren't good for my channel to get to the good points.",6,1583699847,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ffipay/my_issues_with_twitch_as_a_small_streamer/,Twitch,1

ffh025,viscountrhirhi,Fights in the chat.,"Last night I had a fabulous stream! All was great and fun, and I got some follows and met some new folks, yay! 

But later on, there was a bit of a...clash between charters.

Namely, someone new came in and was trying to be helpful, but was giving spoilers in doing so to upcoming jump scares. Now, I don’t mind hints when I get lost (I have dyscalculia and it affects sense of direction—I get lost lots xD) and pointers, but I don’t like spoilers. I ignored it and carried on and tried to blow it off with a gentle “thank you! Just no spoilers, but I don’t mind hints!” but they didn’t stop, and another chatter got upset and defensive on my behalf which resulted in clashing. (The new person was far more aggressive than the person trying to defend me with “hey, it’s her first play through, don’t ruin it for her!” and kind of got insulting?)

My mod (my husband) was briefly AFK but quickly wiped the chat when he got back and told everyone to behave. 

Which I mean is all you can really do, that is what mods are for! But I can’t help but feel kind of bad. D8 What do you do as a streamer when people start to get...heated? Especially when it is in defense of you! I tried a few gentle “hey, it’s okay, let’s let it go!” So I guess I’m looking for advice of how to respond (if at all!) if you notice bickering in your chat while streaming.",18,1583693433,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ffh025/fights_in_the_chat/,Twitch,1

fff7xw,Elathaia,How come male streamers are so much more successful than females? (...are they?),"First things first: I'm German, so please forgive me if there are (and there surely will be \^\^ ) mistakes in this text.

So, I'm a female German streamer (reaaaaally really really smol tho \^.\^). I just read an article regarding the most successful female German streamers. And though they definetely have an impressive amount of followers, I was still staggered by the huge difference between even the most successful woman compared to the most successful male streamers. And I wonder, why is that? Are there still so much more men gaming than women? And if so, do most of them prefer watching men streaming? Do you have to be one of the infamous ""boobie-streamers"" as a woman to be ""successful""? :p

I really wonder why there is this huge difference. I, personally, watch male as well as female streamers/YouTubers. So, what are you guys thinking? Why are male streamers so much more successful? 

Don't get me wrong.

I'm absolutely amazed by the fact that after three long years there are still people who are glad that I'm back and joined me on Twitch again. That's a pretty amount of loyalty &lt;3 and even if many of my viewers are real life friends of mine, every stream is a blast. And I'm aware of the fact that I definetely won't be the next Pokimane (especially since I'm streaming in German and not playing Fortnite etc., hahah :D ).

I just wanted to share some thoughts on this since it kinda caught me by suprise and I'm interested in reading what others think about this. No harrassment or bullying here, please, I'm not planning to start a huge sexism-discussion here or something like that. Only exchanging thoughts :)

I guess that there really are more guys watching streams than girls, and that most of them are rather watching guys streaming. Or maybe there are just more guys playing the most requested games? And - ist this a general difference, or is it only in Germany that there is such a huge gap?

If you read this far, thanks for that and lemme know what you think :)

Since morning impersonators have been infesting the CSGO page with their malicious streams, rebroadcasting shroud, stewie2k and s1mple vods (plus others) with added overlays encouraging people who don't know any better to click on malicious links to claim ""free skins"".  More bots infest the chat pretending to have won to further the scam. Every one of them is being bumped to the top of the page with view bots. Tens of people have lost their accounts/items because of it. No matter how many times these lowlives get reported, it takes way too long for them get banned and a new replacement sprouts up within minutes.

Now, I understand that this isn't a simple matter, but can anyone please tell me why, in light of this issue, there isn't one person assigned to the CSGO page that can nuke these scammers as soon as they appear? This lelvel of flexibility is essential to deal with concerted malicious efforts of this scale.

ffdv4n,CaptainAvocado_,I never imagined it to go this way...,"So I don't know where to being...yesterday I thought it would be a good idea to throw a birthday stream event on my channel. I've been streaming for just over a year now, and would like to say I have a close knit community (average about 3 or 4 regulars). So I knew we could have a little fun with it, and plus, why not, the world is your oyster...right?

Well... I was going in with the mindset to just have fun, celebrate turning 27, have some casual drinks, and incorporate the idea I had of an incentive for every potential sub to the channel. Cake for sub... sounds great right!? Now knowing I'm a small community-based streamer, I planned for the casual ""prime"" subs from a few friends and or family, nothing crazy. (I don't really like cake to begin with lol)

I was roughly about an hour in, we were playing Portal, and one of the streamers from my buddies community dropped a subscription to the channel. Lately, this individual has been popping in frequently to the channel, so I thanked him, shoved a whole piece of cake, one-bite into my mouth and continued playing. ""The cake was NOT a lie"" &lt;3

The now most recent subscriber then spends some channel points on my ""Dare Me To"" option which allows someone to dare me to do something related strictly to the way the game is played. Tells me to try and beat the level I was currently on blindfolded for 5 minutes. As always, challenge accepted!

As I proceed to attempt the level blindfolded this is when what I could have never imagined to happen...happens.

&amp;#x200B;

***\*Insert Climax Notification Here\****

&amp;#x200B;

Alert notifications, one after the other. And myself, still completely oblivious to what is actually happening, attempting to impress the audience and complete the level. My timer goes off and my 5 minute challenge has completed. What were the alert notification's I'm wondering....I take off my blindfold.... to see a +10 Tier 1 Gifted Sub to the channel...and nearly started to cry. Left speechless and didn't know what to say or do, this subscriber requests I play the song ""Celebrate"" by Kool and the Gang!

So I did, and in the only way to express my million-and-one feelings, I tossed the scene over to ""Intermission"" and had a dance party on cam! Everyone seemed to have a blast! We ate more cake, had more drinks, 6 more subs (some individual, some gifted) were given, and we continued to have an amazing stream lasting 11 hours! I'm beyond blessed. 

THANK YOU SO MUCH &lt;3 

If any of your beautiful people end up seeing this post, thank you so much for all your continuous love and support to myself and the channel!

Now, streaming is becoming a passion, but it is a hobby, as I have a demanding full-time job and family comes first. I am also not a Partner, neither an Affiliate, and my past stream had just 3 folks connected.

So, as a hobby, I decided to not accept donations, at least for now. But I got surprised when a serious viewer (meaning not a troll or anonymous user, but a pro Overwatch player) joined my channel and asked me how to donate O.o

Honestly, he joined the channel when all the luck of the universe was at the tip of my fingers and I guess he misperceived some potential on my gameplay, LOL. But I noticed he was surprised when I mentioned I do not accept donations and he left the channel a few minutes later. This got me wondering if my approach could be a deal-breaker for some of the viewers out there?

ffahgd,Mooha182,The 75 average CCV unwritten rule and constant +/-10% viewership changes,"Twitch,

Please clarify in the achievement system if you require 75 average viewers every stream. No twitter posts, help articles, or vague denial messages; make it spell out the actual requirement inside the dashboard achievement text! This is MUCH hard to obtain when doing 'short' streams that non-full time broadcasters cant achieve as easily due to the math of having to wait for people to show up. 

Additionally don't hide the requirements data after someone applies . Not only can I not see average CCV after raids and other things are taken out, I have actually no clue where I stand to continuously meet your partner criteria!

While talking about you partnership applications response timelines, almost everyone never gets a response in under 7 business days as indicated in the achievements panel nor even the 14 days as indicated in the application confirmation email. It takes many weeks to MONTHS for people to receive a response, all the while they are grinding their butts off trying to meet the requirements continuously. 

Also please fix your system. A few weeks ago you broke something with your viewership counter and now, despite having them show up in chat (I checked this before stream starts), my average is only about 2/3rds of them are actually counting as a viewer. 

Average concurrent viewership numbers are CONSTANTLY fluctuating +/-10%. One minute I am sitting at 100. Next minute it's down to 90. Now we're at 113. Oh, there it's back to 85. Now 128. This is blatantly reflecting on my dashboard and started a few weeks ago, about the same time all of these other problems started. 

On Average, twitch viewership in the game I play has taken a significant 'hit' in recorded viewership since these changes. After looking up other partner'ed broadcaster's stats, it also appears they are having the same issues. 

Please fix this. I have not spent literally years broadcasting and lately I have had more issues with your system then I have ever had!",8,1583660921,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ffahgd/the_75_average_ccv_unwritten_rule_and_constant_10/,Twitch,1
ffabap,piefordays,Is it selfish of me to feel bittersweet when a streamer I’ve supported for years “makes it”?,"There’s something really cool about seeing a small streamer you support make it. Being able to say I was there to watch double digits turn to triple or quadruple digits is so rewarding as a supporter of a channel. 

But, I think it sorta sucks too. 

There’s two streamers that I have been watching weekly and super active in chat for years. In the last six months, they have blown up. Now everything that sorta drew me to their channel (like the personal connection and discussion along with the content) is gone. If I talk in chat now, it quickly gets buried and only sometimes my comment is replied to by them. 

I **absolutely** understand how much of a spoiled brat I sound like. I **absolutely** am happy for the streamers and their success. But in *some* sense you have to get what I’m talking about if you’ve experienced this firsthand. The community was very much apart of and the streamer I very much connected with in chat, is no longer.

After streaming for 2-3 months nearly every day for hours at a time, I began experiencing horrendous frame drops that made the stream unwatchable to everyone. Despite having pretty decent speeds, (100mbs download/10mbs upload on ethernet) streaming became completely impossible. Below are the following steps I took to try and remedy:

1. Upgrading my modem, which boosted my download speed up to 180mbs (turns out it was time for an upgrade anyway) but the issue persisted. 
2. Did several stream tests, dropping the quality down to 360p and a bitrate as low as 500 and I was *still* having frame drops -- I should note that I normally streamed at 720p with a bitrate of about 3500 before having these issues.
3. Called my ISP several times in order to find the issue. They could not detect a single malfunction on either end.
4. ISP sent a technician to the house around the end of January. All speeds perfect. What he did do was install a MoCa filter on our modem which worked! *For a limited time*. 

Now the issues have cropped back up in the last couple weeks almost worse than before and I can't for the life of me figure out why. Part of me wants to think its a hardware issue but my games aren't experiencing lag or stuttering of any kind; it's only the stream. My only other theory is that there is some sort of network interference from a neighbor's house but to me, that doesn't make any sense. If anyone has any ideas, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.",4,1583652044,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ff97t3/experiencing_horrendous_frame_drops_slobs/,Twitch,1
ff9716,boward510,Why is my party chat dominant on the right and static spikes?,"I did a  test stream for audio today and it turns out that party chat is really dominant on the right side of headphones/ speakers and sometimes gets so loud it hits little static spikes. I'm on PS4, use an Astro A40TR mixamp with an Elgato HD60, and run an aux from my PC to the mixamp aux in port to get music and alerts, as well as one from the stream port into the Elgato's audio jack. In OBS I've got it set to HDMI audio with analog input (the only option I have). My external mic as well as game audio was fine, it was just the party chat audio that would occasionally do this. 

Later on when we went to game chat (xbox/ ps4 crossplay for cod) it significantly worsened. After watching the vod over, I went into Elgato's capture software and switched the HDMI audio with analog to just straight up analog, but I cannot do the same when I open the popup for Elgato in OBS. I'm not too sure what's causing this. Can anyone give me any clarity on this?",0,1583651899,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ff9716/why_is_my_party_chat_dominant_on_the_right_and/,Twitch,1

I have tried a couple budget options but they were either way too complicated and/or still looked like crap. So after some thinking and research I have decided that the GoPro Hero 5 Black is going to be my best option. Now I know you can use a phone app to live stream your footage with it but I want to just use it as a webcam using a microHDMI and the Elgato Streamlink setup. During my research I noticed that in later GoPro models, when using this set up, needed to be switched to a ""Live"" setting. Does the Hero 5 Black have this feature and is it even required to use it as a webcam? Been looking everywhere for an answer but haven't found one yet. Also, if anyone knows of any good gear that I can use to attach it to my monitor, telling me about it would also be very helpful.

ff8kkf,GwenStefaniTheThird,"My stream title offended a few of my subscribers, I want to know how I should have dealt with it","Earlier today I titled my stream “Zero Subscriber Special” along with what I was planning on doing in the game I was playing. I have 14 subscribers so I thought people would realize my title was just a joke. Anyway a couple of them were just talking with other viewers in my chat and then a different subscriber mentioned that I shouldn’t have used that as my title because it would make it seem like I’m begging for more subscribers. After that was said, 2 other subscribers that were watching agreed with them. They said it was offensive to them because they spent money on a subscription and I made it seem like they didn’t. I wasn’t too sure of what to say, so I said something along the lines of “I’m sorry it made you feel that way, it was supposed to be a joke.” I didn’t change the title. This made chat a little awkward and I wasn’t able to come back from it so I ended my stream early. I feel like they were being too sensitive but they are also my subscribers so I feel like I should feel bad. 

Should I have changed the title? Was it really that offensive? Nobody else said anything about it and it really was supposed to be a joke",5,1583647889,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ff8kkf/my_stream_title_offended_a_few_of_my_subscribers/,Twitch,1
ff8gqo,Lastritez_,Finding a way to beat the demons..,"So it began 5 years ago in April , I decided to start streaming on twitch after watching tru3talent play dark souls 2 ( which i loved ). I played a bit of this and that with 0 viewers for a few weeks until the viewers list showed 2/3 viewers and I spoke to myself for what seemed like forever. A little while later I switched to project cars and the stream went from strength to strength , I change things up with GTA and the stream blew up but then I found out I had cancer and had to quit work for the op and resulting chemo to kill it off so to speak. I still streamed as much as i could while having treatment although i felt bloody awful , I had already revealed to my viewers what was going on to just make everyone aware that i would not be around as much etc. Not gonna lie , life was tough my wife had to quit her job to look after me and i poured my heart and soul into streaming and while the amount i was streaming almost caused my wife and I to divorce she stuck with me and supported me 110%. I gained various sponsors and stuff and tested games for well known games companies and i was ENJOYING games , I had just been asked to stream supported by a small pc company in the uk when my 23yr son was found dead in a phone box 1/2 a mile down the road. He commit suicide after suffering from depression after being stopped seeing his kid , the world stopped spinning that day and the family imploded. Skip to present day and its March 2020 , I have'nt been active on twitch for around 7 months and it seems i have completely lost my confidence and stopped playing games , well i play games off stream but everytime i think about pushing go live i have a massive attack of nerves and anxiety. Guess i just wanna know if others have this and how to combat it as i used to love streaming and still believe i have loads to offer.",7,1583647251,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ff8gqo/finding_a_way_to_beat_the_demons/,Twitch,1
ff899d,OneDayWarranty,"Today, Streaming Became Permanent.","Today I streamed 5 hours of ‘Pokemon Planet’. It’s a six year old game with a medium sized player-base and not a lot of promise towards stream growth. But I decided to stream while learning the game with a couple of long time friends. During that stream a game developer of this game found my stream, and proceeded to give me and my friends in-game Items that I thought i’d never see. Now just the plain idea of a dev coming into my stream is mesmerizing. But the fact that he took the time out of his day to make mine that much better had such a bigger impact than he could ever imagine. I’ve been losing the motivation that I used to have for streaming when I was 16-17 but today maxed that bar out and blew it into the sky. I want to continue to meet the good people of twitch. And I want to spread the love I have to give across this platform for as-long as I can offer it. Thank-you to everyone for creating this community.

ff7sxd,drburnseuph,How do I solve unintentional stream hijacking?,"Hey all, so I'm a very new and small streamer, I have about 43 followers so I'm still unaffiliated but I stream about four times a week playing Overwatch, Stardew Valley, Subnautica, etc. Lately I've been seeing newer viewers show their faces in my chat which is exciting, but it's also caused a few problems for me that are very delicate and I could use some advice on handling them.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I have one viewer who's younger, who enjoys hanging out in my chat and getting ""life advice."" While I don't mind people sharing their real experiences and venting and looking for advice, there are times where he goes on and on about some very ""sad boix hours"" topics like life, death, love, etc. I have another viewer who likes to hang out in my stream when I play Overwatch. Typically when I play overwatch i play with an open lobby and invite viewers to join my queue with me. This person joined me a few times and one night when I was on stream in discord with a friend, they asked if they could join us in discord, of course I obliged and we all three queued up together. Over the next two hours or so of my stream, this person essentially hijacked the commentary entirely, and the commentary they were giving was not at all in line with how I typically like my streams to run. During these times I've seen a LARGE number of viewers pop in, and then immediately pop out, not wanting to stick around because my content is very somber or there's a person who basically never stops talking and saying weird stuff on my stream.

&amp;#x200B;

So my dilemma is this: I want my channel to be a fun and open place where anybody feels comfortable to come, relax, and share anything that is on their mind, but I also want to be able to keep control of my content. I don't want to be rude or mean to these viewers because they're pivotal members of my community, but I also don't want to come up with some half assed excuse every single time I'm asked if they can join me in discord because I'm already in with an IRL friend about why they can't join me. It's an odd issue I feel like, and I kinda feel like a jerk, but I'm not sure. Does anybody else have this issue/has had this issue in the past? Thanks y'all!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I have two younger viewers continuously hijacking my chat and commentary and turning it into their stream entirely and I don't know how to politely keep control of my own content.",9,1583643564,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ff7sxd/how_do_i_solve_unintentional_stream_hijacking/,Twitch,1

ff7qqg,Exotic-Garlic,Xposed is promoting gambling to underage fans.,"For the better part of a two year's Xposed has been streaming Blackjack on and off while taking breaks from Call of Duty.  Throughout the gambling sessions he would make it extremely clear that you should not play if you are in a bad spot financially or underage. I personally believe that this was extremely professional as he acknowledged that majority of his audience is underage and might get the impression that gambling is a good idea as they watched him win large amounts of money.

My perception of him changed greatly yesterday when he hopped on stream and started talking about this great casino he partnered with called 'Roobet' which was giving him 'free money' and 'giveaway codes' for his fans to receive free balance vouchers. The website in question that Xposed is promoting has zero age-verification in place, and Xposed made this clear as he continuously said all that is needed to register is a username and a password, and if the website was blocked in their country that they should use a VPN. This stream created a lot of backlash that was responded to by banning anyone who even remotely said it was wrong, regardless of their patronage to Xposed.

The reason I made this post is because I developed a horrible gambling addiction at the age of 17 which grew into over $70,000 worth of debt and broken relationships with friends and family. After 13 months of support towards Xposed, I have cancelled my subscription and stop watching.

I have some specific questions I want to ask about streaming. Here is my setup and Internet speed

\-Xbox1X (What I am playing the video game on)  
\-Macbook Pro 2017 High End:(Where I see and configure the stream)  
\+Elgato Software (The software being used too stream)

\-USB Powered Hub: OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock (This is used to connect USB Mic (Yeti X), USB Camera (Logitech C922X), and still trying to figure out if I should plug capture card directly into Macbook Pro or the Hub.  


Internet (TV, XBOX1X and Macbook Pro are all Hard Wired:  
Download Speed: 300 Mbps  
Upload: 30 Mbps  


Here is the issue. I am running 720 60FPS. I usually run at a Bitrate of 6.0. I sometimes get connection issues. I know many of you will disagree, but I am a new streamer, so I use Restream. I stream on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Twitch, Mixer and Periscope all at the same time.  


What I want to know is should I just run at 720 60 FPS (sometimes it works other times it does not). I thought about moving bitrate down to 5.5. I thought about keeping bitrate at 6.0 and just changing framerate to 30 FPS. I play fast games, so I would prefer to keep framerate at 60, but will move it if it would be guarantee to not mess up. I know problems can arise, but I am just trying to figure out why I get the ""low bandwidth"" error in the Elgato Software. When I go to Twitch or Facebook or Mixer and view my stream as if I am a viewer, my stream is pixelating. Please help me out. Thank you.  


I made this post because when I stream, I don't constantly look at my software. I kind of ""set it and forget it"" mode. Problem is, when I was done streaming for the night, I looked at the software and I guess the last 40 mins I wasn't even streaming. Somewhere down the line, my stream disconnected. I do know there are times when I start everything up and I get the low bandwidth error. I am the only person uploading on my internet. Please help me if you can. I have a feeling my bitrate needs to be changed, but not sure.

ff7jkj,Legion_of_Loom,My thoughts after roughly 1 month of streaming,"Hey guys:)

Firstly, I´m overwhelmed by the general positivity in here! So I decided to share my own story.

I started out with twitch roughly 1 month ago. Driven by my unhappiness caused by a dull main job. Im quite the extrovert, connecting with people was always easy to me. Something I really enjoy. I seriously asked myself, does twitch really need another streamer? My answer is, yes! 

I said to myself, if I can just make ONE persons day with a stream, create happiness, it is worth it. I genuinly believe that creating positive vibes makes the world a better place.

I did a lot research about the technical side of streaming, and all the basics I need to know. I am grateful for my girlfriend who always watches my stream, to keep the chat going.

Not long after starting out I got viewers popping in. I jept them engaged and interested enough! I made it to 25 followers already, with averagly 4,5 viewers the last streams.

What really touches my heart are not these numbers I didnt expect after one month, but hearing from regulars that they literally wait for me to come live. That they love my passion and direct personality. 

These days I mainly stream Age of Empires 2 DE, I already made friendships in the community.

My heart is just filled with happiness guys. It means the world to me that I entertain other people. That I make their day sometimes... I´m looking forward to the future! I will definately throw in some travel vlogs down the road, since I am a regular in south korea:)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this was my story! Btw: One reason why I do not stream in my native language german is, that I can build a wonderful community all over the world! SPread the love. Let no boundaries keep you down!

ff5kih,LonerExistence,Can't set up stream for switch =/ - I've been trying for the few hours.,"Hi.   
I'm trying to stream for the first time - I don't intend to get big, I just want to make friends. I wanted to stream Fire Emblem Three Houses from my switch on my laptop (Asus is the brand, if it helps). I've even bought the Elgato.   


I have spent the last couple hours watching tutorials and all that shit but none of it is working. I don't even want anything fancy. I just want to stream online and maybe figure out the rest later. But all it keeps telling me is that there's no switch signal even though I have a dock. Now I'm not good with computers, but the tutorials made it seem so easy and for reason nothing is working. I'm legit getting pissed.   


Can anyone help me through discord or direct me to some better tutorials? This is something I really have to do...and it's discouraging that I can't even set it up -\_-''.

ff5j54,Nithrate,Reastream uses only left channel - SLOBS,"Hi y'all, I hope this post fits here... 

I've been having serious trouble while dealing with SLOBS and Cubase with my Focusrite Scarlett Solo 2nd Gen. I want to stream guitar + mic, and the only feasible way to capture guitar + guitar rig I've found so far... is by using reastream. I'l explain:

&amp;#x200B;

On Cubase I have 2 tracks - guitar and mic. 

On the guitar track I have guitar rig and reastream, sending audio to local broadcast (2 channels. marking 1 doesnt make a difference). 

On the mic track there's Voxengo Recorder, because I have found out that if I intend to stream both tracks towards SLOBS, it causes severe distortion on the sound and its impossible to work with it.

&amp;#x200B;

THEN.

&amp;#x200B;

on SLOBS I have an audio output capture for the guitar (audio device is focusrite) with reastream set as a filter, receiving sound , Identifier is correct. However, when I record or go live, the guitar's audio will sound ONLY on the left channel, as if its a MONO signal trying to sound ON A STEREO TRACK. 

&amp;#x200B;

On another note, don't know if its related, but SLOBS won't do anything whenever I try to change its audio settings from stereo to mono. I've already tried with their support guys, but to no results. 

&amp;#x200B;

am I missing something here? can anybody help me? if this isn't the place to post this, please tell me so I can post it where it belongs, thanks.",1,1583632522,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ff5j54/reastream_uses_only_left_channel_slobs/,Twitch,1

ff50ts,MisterMercy,Can't get Modern Warfare (PC) to stream for the life of me.,"Specs:&gt;!Single-PC Setup, CPU: Core i5 9400f - 6 Cores @ 2.9 Ghz, GPU: GTX 1070 Ti - 8 GB, RAM: 2x8GB DDR4 2400Mhz, Internet: 100 mb/s down, 6 mb/s up!&lt;

Title is what it sounds like. I really want to play CoD on stream but it just doesn't want to work for me. Every other game that I've played on stream runs perfectly fine at 720p 60fps using the Nvenc encoder. I keep my bitrate at about 4000 CBR (this does fluctuate both slightly above and below this number but I think that's normal. 

However, I've noticed when playing Modern Warfare specifically, my bitrate spikes uncontrollably even though I never change my bitrate from 4000. One time I recorded a bitrate as high as 9000 during one of these spikes. Obviously, since my internet can only handle up to 6 mb/s up, anything that gets even close to that makes me drop frames like crazy to the point where the stream is unwatchable. 

I've tried lowering the bitrate down to 3000. I've tried switching to x264 encoder. I've tried porting my entire overlay over from Streamlabs into OBS Studio. Nothing has worked. There are so many frames being dropped that both of my streaming softwares can't even keep up cause watching my past broadcasts back I am obviously dropping way more frames than it is reporting. The core game modes are unwatchable and Ground War might as well be a slideshow. 

The crazy thing is, the game always runs fine. I only occasionally lag when loading up into a map and in-game I'm able to maintain well over 60 fps at near ultra settings with no noticeable performance drops. It's only the stream that suffers in quality. I have had performance issues in the Campaign off of stream which, according to my research, is due to the abnormally high CPU Priority setting the game forces. I have reigned in the CPU priority with Process Lasso but it didnt seem to make that big of an impact on CPU performance in the campaign. Again, multiplayer works great in-game with no issues.

I don't know what to do. This is the game I enjoy the most right now and its what I really want to stream. I don't want to end up forcing myself to play something I don't care about just cause the game I do care about refuses to work properly.

ff0pqz,StanTheRebel,Streaming is a competition.,"I know a lot of people don't want it to be, but it is.

If you want to make a living from this, you need to have a lot of viewers. In my experience, a base level steady income starts arguably around 100 real life, consistent viewers who are highly engaged.

To get there and keep it, takes a lot of work, good ideas, action taking, and a proper driven and competitive mindset.

Now, there is nothing wrong with streaming just for fun, but if you are trying to grow and do something on another level, you need to realize you can't just do it for fun. You need to put some serious work into what it is you do. Because if you don't, the guy/gal that does is going to be the one with the viewers.

To break it down we can compare to a competitive game. There is casual play and ranked play. There are some people who take ranked play very seriously, and there are some people who just play casual so they can have some fun. Apply that to streaming, and you have casual streamers, and tryhard ranked streamers.

Tryhard streamers tend to get further in the game of twitch.",4,1583611823,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ff0pqz/streaming_is_a_competition/,Twitch,1

fezmst,Zuljann,Streaming &amp; MINDSET,"I've stated streaming earlier this month, its been really interesting and overwhelming, learning about webcams, audio, lighting profile ect. But the biggest hurdle, something that I've had to develop myself is the proper mindset.

**Realistic expectations.**

I have a different spin on this, generally people think others have unrealistically high expectations, but I feel more often than not  its the opposite or some weird amalgamation of both. Thoughts like I'll never be able to make this a career or why even start its already to late? Are just as unrealistic and are even more detrimental than compared to having a goal of being the ""BIGGEST"" streamer on twitch. The first will create doubt, maybe to the point where you even convince yourself not stream, both being unhealthy but the ladder far worse. This is why its so important that you decide what is that you'd like to achieve.

**Do what you enjoy.**

Do what you enjoy is a cliche at this point, sorta like the advice, be yourself. Streaming is an interesting thing because It isn't necessarily hard, but still sometimes for whatever reason i'll find myself being hesitant to get online. You have to decide what you prioritize, striking the balance between what brings in viewers and doing what you enjoy. You're enthusiasm will constantly change this is a GIVEN, it WILL ebb and flow, some days you'll be really feeling it others you might not even want to stream. I've had to realize that any skill that you're attempting to learn will be difficult and accompanied by doubt, a lot failure AND SUCCESS. In the beginning stick with it and just like anything, if its something that you've developed, it'll be something you'll enjoy. 

**Put in the time**  

At times I've streamed 10 -15 hours over the span of a few days without a single person joining the chat , I've come to the realization, the people you see on Twitch/YouTube have been at this for YEARS. Maybe your thinking to your self that if only u got a lucky break, but here is a hypothetical question I've asked myself, even if you had a huge explosion of viewers , hundreds of people in chat or thousands, are you someone who other people would want to watch? Maybe you feel shy on steam, maybe you haven't found what makes you entertaining, maybe your streaming schedules erratic, like any other skill streaming takes time, being entertain finding your niche can't be bought.

fezkun,fracno,My wife started streaming and it’s frustrating!,"My wife started streaming recently and it’s been an interesting experience for me. I’ve been streaming for about 8 months and I’ve spent a lot of time dialing in my OBS settings, gathering gear to have a professional quality look, tweaking my overlays. I spend a lot of time promoting my channel and making YouTube content to drive more traffic to my channel. I network and stick to a regular stream schedule. It’s a lot of work! 


She started her stream and right out the gate, her stream looks amazing. All because she’s using my equipment to do it. She’s using my computer to do it and so her settings are all perfect right off the bat. She even sorta copied my overlay and didn’t have to go through the awkward beginner stage of having a super cluttered overlay. All my hard work and testing, and she just swoops in and benefits from all of it without having to do the work herself. 


And the followers. Oh my god it’s ridiculous. In one week she was doubling my numbers with no promotion or YouTube channel! I’m watching her stream blow up with subs and donations and a lively chat. All in her first couple weeks of streaming. Now she gets well over my average and last night she passed me in subs. 


All this to say that it’s FRUSTRATING. It’s frustrating because I couldn’t be more happy for her and she’s absolutely killing it, but I know there are people who read this and thought “women streamers have it so easy”. Her success takes nothing away from mine. Improve yourself and be happy for the success of others. She’s having a blast streaming, and we’re building her a PC this weekend.

I started streaming because I love talking and sharing what I’m doing with other people. I’ve been playing video games since I was a kid so one day I thought: “wtf, let’s try Twitch!”. Nowadays I feel the same buuuut! I also want to improve my streamer skills to reach a higher audience.

Which things am I doing now for that?

1. Designing a logo ti create a visual identity on my channel.

2. I uploaded my first emote 1 week ago - it’s ny fucking face 😂 - I know, that’s really common, but it’s easy and free!

3. I’m trying to share my experiences with other people to learn from their own experiences via SM (as for example this post! 😜)

My microphone and audio interface is connected to my streaming pc, however now i'm confused on what to do for my OBS on my streaming pc to hear my audio on my gaming pc.

few5bd,JSW12Gaming,Streaming PC Question,"So I’ve just recently gotten into streaming and recording. I upgraded my PC last summer and built that from scratch. I still have my old desktop that I use to play games on, but it has been scrapped of all its parts pretty much except for the power supply, hard drive, case and motherboard. My current PC sits at about an $850 build. I can record gameplay and it will be decent, but I haven’t really tried streaming with it yet. I’m looking to do a little bit of upgrading here and was wondering if it would be smarter to upgrade some small parts to the old PC and keep my current one as is or if I should just put the upgrades into my current build. Not looking to spend a ton, but I would like to know if it would be better for the long run to just have a dedicated streaming PC. I tried looking into it before and never really got any answers.

fesnj9,UnableCase,"Setup Question: One PC for Game, Capture &amp; Stream, &amp; one laptop... Can I therefore 'manage' my Twitch stream dashboard/chat from a second laptop via a web browser on the laptop?","Hi all, new to this; but spent enough time searching for an answer that I don't feel *too* bad for posting what may be considered a noob question...

...this is where I'm sure I overlooked something; but real sorry if this answer was right in front of me!

****
Setup:
- Streaming and gaming from one PC. 
- Have a laptop doing nothing; but obviously isn't powerful enough to dedicate toward 'capture' and stream.

Hypothetical setup (question in here! Please kindly tell me if this would work, or why there's no point, or why it's a silly idea and won't work...):
- Same as above, BUT, logging in to Twitch from ANOTHER computer at the same time as stream to access the 'dashboard' or 'chat' webpages for the steam...

Is this dumb? Or a dumb question?

Just looking to save computing resources wherever I can; while leveraging the 'free' screen just sitting next to me. All the streamers I watch either don't run a laptop next to them with the broadcaster dashboard/chat on it, or they have dual PC setups to isolate capture/broadcast and their content. 

I have *the feeling* that they're using the Twitch dashboard on the gaming PC and not the capture PC; which essentially answers my question (2 computers are logged in to 'manage the stream', and the 'dashboard management' isn't occurring on the capture PC - a close variant to what I'd be looking to do).

But just seeking some confirmation from someone more knowledgeable than me (which is probably anyone reading this haha).

I know I can just 'try' it and find out I suppose; but my rationale for posting this is that if I had this question then perhaps someone else might too. erhaps they'll find their answer here (if the answer is clear) and save the trial and error side of things.

Then again perhaps I just missed the answer on my search!

What is the point where you think you should just time-out / ban someone instead of taking in criticism?  


An old-time viewer has expressed their dislike of the channel's art and the artist for them, and even though It obviously made me sad, I said I am sorry he feels that way but we like it and he is always allowed to use emotes from other channels here instead then.  


But the person continued to go out of his way analyzing what they think is wrong with all of it and that made me lose my shit to be fair.

I get at most 1 real viewer a week and the other is just some random bot that’s always there. I’ve watched all the videos on how to be successful, I make all my own overlays and animations. I try to be engaging and when I get a real viewer I’m told that they enjoyed my stream and they’ll be back but nobody ever comes back. I’ve gotten involved in other communities (Which in turn has allowed me to meet some great smaller streamers), but I NEVER self promote in their streams.

By societys standards breasts not covered in public is considered nudity, while a shirtless male isn't. However you can get banned for being shirtless on twitch as a guy, and a girl can tape her nipples and just paint the rest which is allowed.

If I were to do the same with my male genitals would it be acceptable? As by society standards it is nudity to show that area, however if I paint it, twitch would allow it? 

I understand it's just breasts but like... cmon, man. In general breasts exposed is nudity.",15,1583564021,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ferl8u/genuine_question_i_know_its_been_said_but_how_is/,Twitch,1

Most of the time, I have between 0 and 1 viewer, and the one viewer pops in and out of the stream, doesn't stay the entire time and isn't involved at all in the chat.

feqdnv,JCDallas88,"Been Streaming to 0-3 Viewers For Two Months, No Growth?","Hey guys, I started streaming at the start of the New Year, and I've had at most maybe 5 viewers in a stream at once, max, all of which were in real life friends/possibly a family member. Generally speaking, most of the time when I stream, my friends are busy with work/other life events they have going on, and my streams get 0 viewers, or the once in a rare occasion one other person besides me in there. I'm still new at this, I'm aware, but at this point I expected to have at least someone/a couple people in the chat consistently at this point.  I'd be happy if I was consistently getting between 5-10 people watching, with maybe two people active in the chat, but I can't even get that..

How can I grow organically without having literally anyone to watch/interact in the chat with?

I stream games like Modern Warfare, Clone Hero, potentially MLB The Show, CSGO, etc, games I enjoy playing, typically two or three nights a week. I'm constantly talking for most of the time, if one of the viewers are in the chat, I interact with them, but I just can't seem to grow literally at all beyond my friends/family. I post on all of my social media when I'm going live usually 30 mins in advance, but nobody comes. My twitter has 900+ followers, My Instagram has 20-40 of which consistently see my stories (and more followers than that) and my facebook has a similar amount of exposure compared to my instagram. 

I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, I want to be able to expand my stream beyond my friends and family, but I'm not sure how to do it, especially when I have 0 viewers most of the time?

I'm usually good for anywhere between 2-5 viewers a night, one of my subs is a friend from the military and another is a guy I game with who said if I got affiliate he'd give his prime sub to my channel.

fepbfg,wafflestompoz,Made affiliate + had the best stream ever!,"**Background**

I've been streaming properly for maybe a few weeks now. I'm mainly playing an Aussie cop on a FiveM (GTA 5 RP) server and really love playing.

Been hanging around Twitch for a while, mainly just watching a few select people who play the same games I do.

**Starting out**

There's nothing worse for new streamers than doing 3-4 hour streams with one average viewer, or less. On top of that, because of no interaction, you often forget you're streaming and forget to check chat so if that one person does come in and start chatting, you miss it!   


Reminding myself to check chat every minute or so was a pain, but got used to it pretty quickly.

**My community**

Things started to go really well. I had numerous stream issues I had to work out:

* Crap CPU (i7 6700) for streaming, but it just managed the job
* 21:9 downscaling
* Getting to appear professional 

The guys in my FiveM server really helped out and stayed in stream after they'd finish playing for the night. 

**Hitting affiliate**

Probably took 3 weeks to hit Affiliate. Then came a whole new load of work:

* Custom sub badges
* Custom emotes
* Fixing up alert audio to match my stream/character theme

**Last night's stream**

What really sucked was going through a rebuild to get my steam more reliable. So I upgraded to a Ryzen 9 3900x, ROG STRIX x570-E and bumped the RAM from 2400mhz to 3200mhz.

That also meant I had an 8 day delay after making Affiliate to actually stream, due to work responsibilities and a whole crapshow with the PSU failing, the store dropping my brand new CPU and bending a pin (it was replaced brand new on the spot).

Here's what happened last night:

* 7 subscribers (FIRST EVER AFFILIATE STREAM!)
* 6161 bits spent on cheers
* 1 x hype train
* 19 peak viewers, 12 average

**Overall**

I adore streaming because I absolutely love my community. They're amazing. I enjoy playing, but also equally adore interacting with my chat. Now have two mods who are assisting with my Discord server.

For anyone just starting out - remember there will be times when you're streaming to NOBODY. But we have basically all been there. 

Thanks for reading, guys, hope eventually this will provide some value to somebody, somewhere!

Maybe I whould get a usb-mic, like a HyperX, or a Røde NT-USB. I would like to get a quality microphone for about 3-400 $.

Please help me, I am stuck looking for some good stuff, that isn't too expensive.

femrv0,Fuzkeren,Set specific count command?,"Hi!  


One of my good friends that I'm modding for has recently started playing the Dark Souls games.   
Of course, you need a deathcount command for this, which we already have up and running.   
However, we would also like a command that could overwrite the existing count-number and make us able to set it to a number we would like.  


So even if the the deathcount was 19, we could write something like !setdeathcount 27 and it would change to 27.   


Right now we have

!deathcount which gives the count +1 each time it's used

!resetdeathcount which resets the count.  
Does anyone know how to make a !setdeathcount command, to set it to a specific number?  


Thanks in advance!",1,1583539284,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/femrv0/set_specific_count_command/,Twitch,1

“There is a content creator we love to watch,
On twitch and discord he's above by more than just a notch,
He may get lost, punch chickens and scream,
But wor scuba is still our favourite one to stream,
Good craic from the toon, which is hard to find, 
Though his directionally challenged brain blows our mind. 
Wether he is under water, in space or on another world,
Wor scuba manages to gain more followers (well deserved) 
Shouts of 'get to da choppa' or the 'kappa slap' 
Just increase his stress levels and make him flap!
While we sit behind our screens snorting with laughter,
Hes funnier than a highly paid actor.
His mods are all great but rarely need to ban,
Cos everyone listens intently to the all great, bearded man
But the truth of his fame and love from all,
Is his cute doggo teddy, whos only 5k coins to call”

I'm not a streamer but I mod for one and viewers that get a gift sub rage when they don't get benefits. When you get gifted a sub you didn't do anything but get lucky or begged for it. 


The streamer I mod for has Snapchat, discord, and sub-saturdays for subs only. It's always the same thing every time someone gets a gifted sub. They start getting snappy in chat and either I or the streamers do the ""!bio"" command. It says sub perks are for subs only not gifted subs. Its so irritating having to ban or time people out that start raging.",12,1583518442,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fehk5c/gifted_subs_and_entitlement/,Twitch,1
fehj0u,AKVO2,Streamer News/Gossip," I started a new quasi-satirical online news/gossip ""mag"" called Streamer + Gamer ([streamergamer.com](https://streamergamer.com)) for things related to streamers and the video game/e-sports world-at-large. Day-to-day musings and stupid streamer news - think a dumber Dextero-meet-Onion.

Why did I do this? Idk, I find myself reading about vapid streamer news/gossip all the time, so I figured I'd write some myself as a fun pastime. I also hope to use the site to promote lesser known streamers with a Featured Streamer section highlighting a new streamer each week.

Anyway, if anybody here is interested in writing about streamer/video game related news, you can Submit articles directly on the site. No, I can't pay anything - I have no money. So why would you want to do this? Idk, Maybe you’re bored? Or want to practice your writing by crafting quippy articles on the internet? Perhaps you want to get your name out there or plug your stream/site/YouTube? Could be fun. The details can be found on the About page.

Hopefully I haven't wasted too much of your time with this post and if you do go to the site maybe you'll enjoy it. Or not, ha. Toodles.",2,1583518323,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/fehj0u/streamer_newsgossip/,Twitch,1

feguha,Eric_HamiltonDevices,Sorry for breaking the rule 2.,"hey All,

With all my inexperience I've actually broken some rules to the Twitch Subreddit, I apologize from the bottom of my heart. It wasn't my intention to break the rules, nor offend people with my insensitivity and ignorance. I've read the rules and hopefully I won't be breaking any more of them. Please let me know if I do, I am still a newbie for sure.

I'll try it again; Do you guys know of any THC/CBD smoking Twitch Streamers?

Thanks in advance. Oh and if I break a rule again, please just let me know with regular words... You're not doing this amazing community any favors by being toxic and stupid.",3,1583515708,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/feguha/sorry_for_breaking_the_rule_2/,Twitch,1

This question came to my mind this morning as I was being followed by someone in which I merely tweeted back: “Thank you for the follow!”  It occurred to me that maybe I should be following those such people back. But what if I’m not interested in their content?
