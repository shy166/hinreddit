fsobe8,JRobinson16e,Looking for participants for a WoW survey study!," 

**You may have seen this post before!  If you've already taken this survey, please do not take it again.  Thank you!**

Hello! My name is Jessica Robinson, and I am an assistant professor and researcher at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on social and emotional experiences in video games – who we play with, who we talk to, and how we play while socializing. I’ve been playing *World of Warcraft* myself since just after *The Burning Crusade* launched.

I’m looking for current players of *World of Warcraft* to participate in a study about players’ experiences in Azeroth. This research study focuses on the emotional connections that *World of Warcraft* players develop within the world of Azeroth – connections to their personal experiences, to their fellow players, and to Azeroth itself. If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to fill out a survey that asks about your experiences in *World of Warcraft*, the specific *World of Warcraft* content you play, and basic demographic information. This research will help video game scholars better understand the emotional connections that players form with video game worlds; this knowledge can improve game design and user experience in the future!

I am looking for current players of *World of Warcraft Battle for Azeroth* AND current players of *World of Warcraft Classic* to participate in this study. You might be a player of just *Battle for Azeroth*, just *Classic*, or both!

Participation is voluntary, and all of your responses and information will be kept confidential. You must be a current player of *World of Warcraft* (*Battle for Azeroth* AND/OR *Classic*) and 18 years of age or older to participate. If you’re interested in participating, have any questions, or want more information, please feel free to get in touch with me via email ([jrobinson@kutztown.edu](mailto:jrobinson@kutztown.edu))

The question asking participants to list locations in Azeroth has been updated based on feedback from participants - thank you for the feedback!

If you are interested in participating, please use this link to open the (updated) survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWS4niarF2PtRCe6jMQ-FTYaD\_-7Pjs5iYD9KSxg5CzayMxw/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWS4niarF2PtRCe6jMQ-FTYaD_-7Pjs5iYD9KSxg5CzayMxw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

My problem with the community is the lack of helpful peoples or even lack of communication. 

Example i was like in 5-10 guilds already and 90% of the time when i tried to ask help for gearing up or help with certain quest or raid or whatever no one even tried to help me. 

And its really frustrating that i'm running around like a headless chicken to found my way around in Bfa. 

Many players already have all Alliances Races and flying in Legion and Bfa but me i'm struggles with the smallest things in them since i not have any friends to play with and i feel really lonely.

fskfet,Swordbreaker925,Why Do Elemental Shamans Use Melee Weapons?,"Is there a lore reason as to why Elemental Shamans use a one-handed melee weapon and shield while casting? I've tried to look for an answer but cant seem to find one.  


I'm already confused as to why other casters dont even use their staves, but why then do Elemental Shamans, who are ranged casters, use melee weapons at all? And why is one of them a shield when Shamans are not tanks?  
If the animation had them channeling elements through their melee weapon as a catalyst and then throwing the element, it would look amazing and make sense, similar to how Enhancement Shamans can throw their 'Rockbiter' ability up to 20 meters. But instead it just sits there on their hip, their shield on their back, while they use their hands for casting. I'm so confused as to why they carry melee weapons, especially why one of them is a shield instead of dual-wield.  


Also, is there any particular reason why ALL casters dont use their weapons at all? They just sit sheathed while the caster uses their hands. It doesnt make any sense.  
Also, why do all casters' basic attacks have a cast time when melee characters dont, and hunters dont either? Makes playing a caster feel kinda clunky imo.",48,1585685937,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fskfet/why_do_elemental_shamans_use_melee_weapons/,wow,0

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a question re farming that maybe some mathematicians could help out with.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had a Binding drop on one character and am farming MC every week to try get the other one to make thunderfury.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, would it be a waste of time to farm MC on other alts who don't have the bindings?  


So its like 

&amp;#x200B;

1 chance of 1 binding per week vs Multiple alts farming 2 bindings per week on top of the alt.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this would be pointless as I'd still need to get 2 bindings on 1 char.

fsjr6j,sdempsey313,What if secondary skills were made account wide?,"Create a system where you're usage of the secondary skills applies experience towards some greater account level. It would expand the 'experience' or 'skill level' required for certain accomplishments or achievements, but it would allow it to be appreciated over several accounts. Could revitalize things like bandage and fishing.

It would also give time for developers to create incentives for further use of these skills. Basically, shift the time-gate from what we have (world quests, raid resets, spawns, dailies) to something that literally takes time...instead of it being mindless grind. Send us all over the world to fish specific zones. Make us farm random cloths to make special bandages. Create a recipe of the week that requires meats from all over the worlds.  

Granted, grind is grind. And lest be honest, do you need anything other than gathering skills to make money? But this would at least push players to explore different and often forgotten areas of Azeroth and the expanded world. 

This would allow long time players to revisit and expand on the characters they have, without feeling like they have to do the same quest line/content over and over again, but still give players that feeling of accomplishment. Because there is variability in the materials you need/locations you need to fish/xpac's cloth you need, this could help spread players out, while also adding some kind of gear reward.",2,1585683826,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fsjr6j/what_if_secondary_skills_were_made_account_wide/,wow,0

Before the Storm was pretty solid and actually made me appreciate the otherwise very underwhelming current expansion a bit more.

It feels like Golden really wanted to write a modern day courtroom drama and got stuck with Warcraft so just decided to cram it in anyway. It's established that this trial is the first of its kind, but everyone talks like modern day lawyers, all sorts of modern day court rules seem to apply and everyone seems to know these, despite them never being explained to anyone and Pandaren customs being foreign to Baine and Tyrande, and so on.

Tanks got better single target heals than actual healers and with corruption outAOE dps-classes. They make other classes feel insignificant.

I have to use essences to heal 15-20% of their hp, while frenzied regeneration heals 32% on a low CD with stacks.

fsfbq6,-nastygoblin-,"The Ultimate Guide to How to make WoW great again, IMO!","Hello everyone,

with Shadowlands alpha right around the corner and the current content already implemented for a little while, I've decided to finally give my personal feedback/suggestions to the wow community as well. I am usually just a lurker, not a writer. I apologize in advance for this rather lengthy post.

First things first. I am neither a world first raider nor a PVP gladiator or gold goblin but I have dipped my toes into every part of the game I wanna talk about. Been playing WoW since the end of MoP and actively playing MMOs for years and years now, so I decided it might be a good idea to fuse my experience in other MMO systems with my ideas for WoW to create some good suggestions and these are the topics I wanna talk about:

1. **PVP Gearing,** 
2. **PVE Endgame Rewards,** 
3. **Gear Progression,** 
4. **Professions,** 
5. **The Auction House.**

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. PVP Gearing:

With PVP I mean mainly BGs and Arenas and I think we can all agree that PVP should be mainly about personal skill as well as choosing the right counter talents/strategy for the opponent your are facing and not which player has the better PVE gear. Most of the highest rated PVP players are not wearing a single piece of pvp gear at this stage of the game. PVE gear and especially corruption effects are not only heavily infulencing current pvp meta but also the fact that you receive so little loot from doing arenas that it is mandatory to go do pve content to get your gear, totally defeats the purpose of being a PVPer IMO.

So what could be done differently?

* Completely separate PVP and PVE gear. Just disable PVE gear as soon as you enter an arena or BG
* Introduce tournament like gear, corruption, etc. vendors that sell PVP exclusive gear
* Scale it to current heroic raid level for example. just to have some numbers to play with

 \-&gt; every player has the same ilvl, you can build your specc and min-max the hell out of it, even creating and testing new builds in the blink of an eye.

But what about PVP ranks and gearing progression then, you say? Ok how about this. You can buy your seasonal themed pvp set at your vendors and instead of scaling with your pvp rank, you will have visual effects on your armor that start growing with each rank u get. Think of weapon illusions but on the armor itself. Surely you will unlock this transmog style, once you have reached the mandatory rank one time.

&amp;#x200B;

For example: 

* &lt;1600cr your armor will be without any effects
* 1600-1800 your shoulders start to glow with a red dust surrounding them
* 1800-2100 tiny red glowing ethereal wings will start pop out of your shoulder blades
* 2400 you will have full grown angelic like, red glowing wings pop out of your shoulder, for everyone to see.

Getting rid of gear grinding and focusing on playing with rewarding players with actual prestige style visuals, will make arena a lot more fun IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. PVE Endgame Rewards:

So with the start of legion, blizzard introduced a new endgame system called mythic+ which has grown more and more in popularity up until the point that people no longer raid but doing mythic+ dungeons exclusively and this is absolutely fine. But what about the reward of mythic dungeons and raids? In PvE content it is, and always will be all about character and gear progression but for the longest time now players feel not rewarded enough for what they are doing or just getting overwhelmed by random proccing systems on top of random proccing systems, that gearing in pve has gotten considerably worse over the last expansions. For simplicity purposes, lets ignore the weekly chest for now and focus on loot in dungeons and raids and how to improve it.

**Raids:** 

Every raidboss should have 3 different pieces of loot available to every raider. What I mean by that is as follows:

* The actual raid gear (armor, weapon etc) drop chance will be the same as it is now.
* If you do not get any of the above and you are for example a blacksmith, you will drop the recipe for the weapon that would have otherwise dropped on that boss (don't be confused I will go into more detail about that in the gear progression and profession part)
* If you don't get the recipe, because you might already have it, you will get the ""raid essence of the current difficulty tier"" (again, don't be confused, I will get into more detail about that soon)

**Mythic+ Dungeons:**

As of now, Mythic+ Dungeons should have a loot ilvl cap, but IMO it should be at mythic raid level, but maybe for a +20 instead of a +15

* The loot system will follow a similar pattern as raids
* At the end of dungeon chest, you will either drop loot, a recipe corresponding to your profession and the dungeon loot table or you will get a ""dungeon essence of the current dungeon difficulty tier""

So what's the point in all of this. Let me make it simple. You will still be able to receive loot from raids and dungeons like it is now BUT you will also be able to grind your way to the desired loot by getting the recipe to craft it AND THEN UPGRADING IT TO THE DESIRED ILVL WITH THE ESSENCES YOU GOT. This has multiple purposes, you don't feel so reliant on RNGesus, professions will be more important again and you will always and only be able to get loot at an ilvl you have earned by yourself because you need the essences to upgrade the baseline item.

# 

# 3. Gear Progression:

Alright. I am sure you guys now have a lot of questions after reading the last part of this article and in this section I am trying to give a closer look at what I am really trying to achieve with this idea. Gear Progression should always be simple and linear without

any fancy systems on top of it so you are looking at a goal you are trying to achieve, when gearing up. So how do you gear?

It's simple. You can buy every single baseline item that drops in a dungeon, raid, worldquest or is a random drop off of the auction house. Why? Because every single item has a profession recipe attached to it, that can be received by ""scrapping"" it. This means, not only professions, materials and grinding the actual content that will get you these patterns, will have a lot more meaning now. But you also have the ability to upgrade your gear as you progress through more and more difficult party of the endgame that WoW is presenting you.

**For example:** You are a fury warrior that just dinged 120 at this stage in the game and you know ""Geti'ikku, Cut of Death"" is your weapon of choice.

* Then you just go to the auction house and buy a baseline 430 mythic dungeon *""Geti'ikku, Cut of Death""*. 
* Now your goal is obviously to upgrade this weapon as you don't want to run around with a 430 weapon. 
* So what are you doing now? You are running King's Rest keys, because that's the dungeon that drops *""Geti'ikku, Cut of Death""* in the first place right? 

So what are your chances now? Let's say you are a monster and directly head into a +10 KR with your current gear. You make it through the dungeon in time and are now standing in front of your chest.

This chest will have 3 different outcomes for you:

* Outcome 1: King's Rest +10 dungeon loot, which also includes a *""Geti'ikku, Cut of Death""* at +10 ilvl, that can be scrapped into the recipe + materials needed to craft it + a +10 KR essence
* Outcome 2: the recipe for a baseline item of the King's Rest loot table, that fits your current profession
* Outcome 3: a +10 KR essence

So let's say you don't have a profession at this point and got no loot either. But now you have got one +10 KR essence. Let's say you do this dungeon 3 more times and will end up with 4 essences in total. Now you can combine these 4 essences into a +10 upgrade token that will only work on KR items. You will use it on your baseline *""Geti'ikku, Cut of Death""* that you bought off the auction house earlier and now have the weapon as if it would have dropped out of the end of dungeon chest of a +10 KR.

This system can be translated to raid gear as well. You get your baseline recipes from the bosses or by scrapping the boss loot. Baseline = normal mode ilvl. You get your upgrade essences by defeating bosses on the difficulty level you want your item to be at, after upgrading it.

&amp;#x200B;

# 4. Professions:

Now I have talked a lot about gearing, ""scrapping"" and the role of professions in all of it, so let's get into more detail about it now. Professions are at a pretty rough state right now. Blizzard has tried to improve that with the profession gear that is exclusive to the player having the profession but that's not really making a difference IMO. The system is still pretty dull and unimportant for the most part. So how do professions tie into my idea of the loot system in WoW? With the introduction of the scrap-bot in BFA and the flood of materials we got from it, with so little use we can make out of it, I thought it might be a good idea that loot actually drops its own crafting recipe as well as some materials you need to craft it, as well, IF you have the profession that is eligible to craft said item. So you are now able to get out into the world, hunting recipes and crafting your goods of choice to sell them at the auction house.

So this is the first part of my idea to improve professions if there wouldn't be our old fiend RNGesus again. Getting random proccs of stats, rarity or sockets is a pain in the \*\*\*. Ofc you won't get an item with different stats out of a recipe that has specific stats on its baseline item but just bear with me for a second. I will give you some examples of how the new profession recipes could look like:

**Engineering:**

* Portable scrap-kits of green, blue and purple rarity
* Each one being able to scrap the items of same rarity or below and extract a special material of that same rarity that's needed for crafting
* So you basically want to use the green kit for an item of green quality to not waste any money and use the purple one for and epic item

**Armor Professions:**

* Since every armor profession has the same purpose, I will sum this up all at once.
* You'll receive your recipe at the above mentioned ways and are now able to craft the baseline item
* For Example a plate west out of the raid that has high haste and low vers stats on it
* You now need a certain amount of iron type materials to craft it, as well as a big haste gem and a small vers gem and an epic material you've got from scrapping with a purple scrap kit
* After combining everything you made yourself a normal mode ilvl plate chest, you can put on the auction house

**Jewelcrafting:**

* Since you are a jewelcrafter you are obviously eligible to craft necklaces and rings with the above mentioned method
* Your gems will have more demand then ever do to the armor professions now needing them as well

**Enchanting:**

* Now this is gonna be fun. I have not talked about items with special effects until this point. Do you remember *""Geti'ikku, Cut of Death""* from earlier?
* Here is the deal. If your scrap it as a blacksmith, you are only able to craft one part of it. The sword itself, which is not a wearable weapon at this point. Now if you scrap the same weapon as an enchanter, you will get the recipe for the 2nd part of the weapon. The enchant that will give the sword it's effect. So as a buyer you want to buy both parts off of the auction house and combine them together for a complete *""Geti'ikku, Cut of Death""*.
* The materials again will be a mix out of standard enchanting dusts as well as a rarity material that comes out of a scrapped item of the same rarity with the right scrap-kit.
* Enchanters will be eligible to craft enchanting scrolls for weapons, rings, necklaces and trinkets.

**Inscription:**

* Inscriptions basically do the same thing as enchanters but they craft runes. Runes that you will combine with your armor. Especially your crafted Raid armor as it only gets its tier set bonus from the runes.
* As of now, we haven't seen much dungeon armor with set boni but there are at least some of them and with this system in mind you can obviously expand on that

**Alchemy:**

* So how well does alchemy fit into all of this? Remember this guy called RNGesus I mentioned before?
* With the same special green, blue and purple materials you can brew ""Luck potions"" that can be sold and used by any crafting profession and only have one purpose raise the chances for procs on crafting. By proccs I mean a socket procc, a leech procc and stuff like that.
* For Jewelcrafting and inscription it would be more likely a chance on cutting more gems or getting an extra rune out of a single crafted recipe.
* For Alchemy it will be the chance for additional potions.

# 5. The Auction house:

If you are still reading by now, thank you for your interest and bear with me a little longer, we are nearly done. With 8.3 blizzard has made a complete overhaul to the auction house. Some people like it, some don't. I think they did a good job on overall stability, faster search times and the ability to bulk up items of the same price. This is already going into the right direction IMO. But there is still ways to improve. In particular one way I want to take a closer look at. BIDDING. Being able to bid on an item has been in the game for a long time now. I'm not even sure if there ever was a time wihout it? The purpose of bidding is absolutely fine, being able to place a bid to get the item of your choice cheeper then you would have, if you would have bought it directly at the buyout price, with the negative effect on having to wait for the auction to end or beeing outbid by someone else. To bypass this, many sellers or buyers are spamming the trade chats with WTS or WTB messages but there is such an easy system that's already proven good in other games and will facilitate the live of both sellers as well as potential buyers and would be a fitting addition to the new auction house ""bulk item style"".

* Don't let people bid on specific item auctions like it is now. Let them Bid on the item itself

**For Example:** 

Health Potions. There are 4 Potions at a price of 40g. 5 for 45g and some others for 50g and beyond. Now we have some people willing to buy 200 potions for 38g/each and this information will be displayed at the item page as well as all the selling offers. So now the next person trying to sell health potions will have two different options.

* Option 1: placing the potions at 40g/each or even undercutting at 39g/each to get the most out of it but have to wait for a potential buyer to show up OR
* Option 2: They see the current offer of 38g/each for 200 potions and say. I want my money now, I sell them for 38g/each and both, seller und buyer are happy.

This system will give buyers and sellers the option to either min-max their profit with waiting times and bound capital in form of items on the AH or money in form of buying orders or choosing the fast way to get money with either buying at buyout prices or selling to the highest buying order prices.

Thank you so much for reading this long ass post. I am really not a writer so don't be mad at me if you think there is some serious bullshit in here and rather give some constructive critique. I would really appreciate it :)

I am not very confident that this post will get much attention but hey, some times even the slightest spark of hope can make a difference and I am sure everyone of us would love to play a great version of WoW: Shadowlands at the end of the year.

fsdugp,Fabosaurus,New to BFA during 100% xp bonus: focus on main or lvl up alts?,"Hey guys,

I've recently came back to WoW with the release of the 100% xp bonus this month.  
I got myself the BfA expansion and after being completely overwhelmed by the enormous amount of changes and new content, I made it from 110 to 120 within a day.

Because I dinged 120 in Vol'dun (Horde) even before I could explore the other regions, I am now already slacking behind on reputation, exploration and unlocking world quests. Because all of those things are rather time consuming and the 100% xp bonus is quite precious, I am highly in doubt what to do next.

Should I:  
**A)** focus on my first 120 main and finish the required content to unlock all endgame features?  
*Or*

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my friend have came back from classic to start from fresh again on new characters on retail again. She played as a warlock and frost mage in Classic and i played as a retribution paladin.

&amp;#x200B;

We are levelling our chracters and so far im at lvl 44 and she is at 42 and we are doing dungeons. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont have any damage meter add ons installed but she keeps saying to me that i keep being ""at the top of dps"" in some of the dungeons we go in and im supposed to be a prot pala (so my dps shouldnt be that great as a tank)

&amp;#x200B;

She's a little dissapointed every time we do a dungeon because she is always at the bottom of the DPS list and she cant figure out why her damage is terrible compared to everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

She is following the rotation for frostmage for her appropriate level on icy veins and she is still scrapping the bottom of the barrel in terms of DPS

&amp;#x200B;

i told her to ignore this and her class may ""open up to more dps when she levels up in later levels"" and these classic dungeons we are doing right now wont be a true reflection of her true potential dps when she's higher levelled and better geared.

&amp;#x200B;

Is frost mage usually like this?

&amp;#x200B;

I tried looking for frost mage guides countless times on youtube to try and help her out but its all lvl 120 bfa frost mage guides so she doesnt have those abilites so have resorted to icy veins frost mage guide on the internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's losing some motivation because she feels lost with the rotation and feels that she's not doing the right thing because its reflecting that she is bottom of DPS most of the time in random classic dungeons we do.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any words of encouragement for her? does frost mage open up more DPS later on in levels? is this normal to be bottom of DPS at lvl 42 as a frost mage?",43,1585659416,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fscfm3/my_friend_is_leveling_as_a_frost_mage_and_she_is/,wow,1

My strategy for Rexxar is to wait for a ready Gift-of-Titans proc. Use Orb in front of Rexxar, pull and switch to the first boar, killing it will usually result in a gift-proc, if not the second will do. And even if I get no proc, killing/interrupting/stunning the boars one by one and then killing Rexxar usually works. But my mage gets beaten to death by Rexxars melee-hits (1mio last time I tried). 

So, I tried mirror images and that helped to mitigate some of the damage and I manged to 5mask on my mage too :D. Still I think I'm overlooking something. Do I?",12,1585657806,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fsc2et/meleedamage_from_rexxar_how_can_i_survive_it_on_a/,wow,1

fsat25,Soyazka,Corruptions issues in 8.3 BFA,"Hello guys,  
First of all, sorry for my english, it's not my main language ;)  


Just a quick post, because i feel the majority of the people are complaining about the corruptions system and i don't understand why everybody seems to accept this non-rewarding system as a blizzard fatality.  


Blizzard can fix it, and it's easy to do :  


\- Withdraw corruptions from BOE, because having to farm gold as the only way to find BIS gear just sucks.

\- Increase corruptions drops, and make the rank accordingly to the difficulty (higher M+ keys, higher rank proc) Having the good corruption, with rank 3, on your BIS would still be super hard.

\- Withdraw weekly corruption chest, it pushes people to do 1 +15 and then stop farming because they know it's a waste of time.  
\- Corruptions procs accordingly to the spec / class. No more tank and heal corruptions on dps, etc.  


\- Add corruptions to the titan residuum system, allow people to buy corruption rank 1 &amp; 2 with residuum. 

  
Usually i don't whine, but i think alot of people that didn't get lucky with corruptions are facing a wall.  
For exemple, i'm a fire mage, and i didn't get once the mastery corruption i need, even the rank 1. And i'm not a casual player, i farm every week HM, MM, MM+, visions and arenas. I think this system is killing players motivation, because it's not rewarding anything but pure luck or gold farming.  


I know blizzard went from good to bad, but does it have to be that bad? I mean, listen to your community, and fix this.

Idea 
Start a fresh level one toons all together (25 people) and set up a guild. This guild will be locking exp at every expac level cap and we will complete every Raid in every available difficulty. I feel like that will make the game really fun for everyone involved because for newer players who never got to experience the older Raids ( I know they aren’t exactly the same ) and the older players who miss then to finally play through them again without being 120 one hitting everything. I would enjoy meeting some cool people who are down to grind and have a great time at the same time.

fs5bxi,GodkingYuuumie,I think Dungeons at max level should balance more for item-level.,"I'm writing this straight after I finished a dungeon, where the tank with around double the item level of everybody else in the group did more than double the damage of every single DPS in the group combined. And I personally found that very irritating. I don't have statistics on how often something like this happens, nor do I know exactly how the dungeon seeker works and what it looks for, all I know is that something like this where one or a few party members is so much stronger than me and the others in the group, that it becomes a one-man party, happens often enough that I have grown irritated with it.

I can see a different perspective on this, because some people are just grinding dungeons for EXP or loot and might actually be glad that somebody so much higher level is there to make the dungeon ten times quicker than it would otherwise be. And to be clear, I'm not blaming the players with a higher item-level than me, they should be free to queue into any sort of PvE content they want - The issue I have is more so with the dungeon finder for pairing us up.

That being said, I actually find it really disheartening and boring. I am a super casual player, and I normally enjoy playing dungeons a lot, as they're a nice break from the questing that can grow monotonous after a while. You get to use a bunch of abilities that you don't really use in the open world, , since most of them are useless while killing random mobs, and you get to pop your big cooldowns to show off just how much damage your character can do. Beyond that, the fights themselves are ofc much more challenging, with actual mechanics you have to play around and attacks you have to dodge, and actually having to pay attention to doing your rotation properly since the enemy doesn't die within 10 seconds. 

So, with all of that in mind, it really sucks when, you queue into a dungeon, just to end up basically doing nothing as all the enemies are dead before you even get your first rotation off. It feels really shitty to just run after the super-powerful dude, feeling useless, and then getting rewards for it anyways. It's like, ""well why the fuck am I here, you clearly don't need me"". Like yeah, the gold and azerite is nice I guess, but it really feels like I wasted 5-10 minutes of my life. The game might as well have just placed my character on a treadmill for the same amount of time, then given me the stuff.

I don't know how common of a problem this is for people, maybe I'm completely alone in feeling like this. But it was something I experienced in Legion too, and it sucks the joy out of something I otherwise enjoy. It doesn't happen often enough for me not to want to do dungeons at all, but it happens often enough that I do it less. Therefore, I think that the dungeon finder maybe should look more at the actual stats and/or itemlevels of the characters, since two players both at max level can have widely different strengths depending on how far they've gotten on the grind for better gear.  


Tl;Dr: It feels bad when you're thrown in a max-level dungeon with a player with a vastly higher item level than you, that wipes the floor with the dungeon while you run after and do nothing, and I think Blizzard should change the dungeon finder to focus more on making sure the item levels of players are roughly equal as to prevent one or a few players from becoming useless.",12,1585624415,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fs5bxi/i_think_dungeons_at_max_level_should_balance_more/,wow,1

I'm an old WoW player that quit in WoD and came back for classic, which has been a blast. Now, with two 60s and no more content to do I was considering giving retail a try, my only problem being I don't know which server is the best for me. I'm tied between Emerald Dream and Wymrest Accord at the moment. ED because it was my server from back in WoD, and Wymrest because I've read it's very active on the horde side. I've heard great things and bad things about both, my main concerns being that ED doesn't have much RP anymore and finding a good raiding/RP guild. 

So I suppose my question is: between Emerald Dream and Wyrmrest Accord, which is better for a returning retail player to find RP and raiding in? Again, apologies if this is the wrong sub for this. Thanks friends!",6,1585623066,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fs4zvl/picking_a_rp_server/,wow,1

frywuc,FPS_Gunfighter,Just a thought for geared players.,"Hey,

I'm sure a lot of you are like me, more or less as geared as you're going to get or to the point where you really only have a couple activities a week to do on your main. With all this 'at home' time a lot of people have, I've seen a pretty large influx in new or returning players. Might want to consider taking the time to carry new 120's or lower geared toons through some M0's or low keys as sort of a 'paying it forward' activity. It kills time, creates a positive vibe in the community, and might ensure some of these new guys stick around in a game we love to play but is constantly losing membership. 

So far it's been fun to run content that's brainless, and it's nice to make a sort of social connection with people in a game that's lost a lot of it's social aspect ever since things like LFG, etc. came out. Anyway, I'm sure it's already apparent to a lot of people, but worth mentioning in case someone was browsing the subreddit bored.

fryajo,Swobodny,"[LORE: ""Sargeras and the Betrayal""] Why does this book in Classic tells a story in opposition with the canon version of WoW's lore?","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b4qmmbk58vp41.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23f5aac066b48af9e8f73d346356c59ea0ea1813

This books lays in Hammerfall's inn : ""Sargeras and the Betrayal"". This is in complete opposition with the official lore, since the Eredar are non other than the original Draeneï. Some of the Eredar were later corrupted by Sargeras who made two of their leaders, Kil'jaeden and Archimonde, his lieutenants, but the Eredar weren't evil to start with ! 

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""Eredar\\"" page from WoWpedia](https://preview.redd.it/kev3xm868vp41.png?width=1225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e4548e7186c8db8b5da555b63b67867ff0250f0)

Before anybody mentions a lapsus on the devs side, no, they didn't mix them up with the Nathrezim (dreadlords), who are mentionned later on in the book :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xq5ztvxy8vp41.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1c8235c2d2610cb84c6b2ae08f54c086469fa2

The way this book is written, it seems that the whole ""Good Eredar"" plot was invented later on, only to justify the presence of a non-corrupted group (the Draeneï, led by Velen), which allowed the writers to expand on the origins of said group and justify a portion of them joining the Alliance.

Not that it's the first time such thing happens. I remember when it was clearly written on WoW's website that the well of Eternity's destruction broke the continent into 4 pieces : Northrend, Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms and the South Isles. And that's exactly what people expected after WotLK : a South Isles' expansion. Pandaria was taken from literally nowhere.

Same with Silithids whose empire was specifically precised to have been broken into only two pieces by their wars with trolls, not three (the mantids did not exist originally). I guess the devs have to adapt the lore to the game sometimes !

frxxt4,The_phantom9,Heroic Questing - Repost since Shadowlands is coming,"**I posted this a while back but now that Shadowlands is in alpha I think it would be great to post again** 

One of my favorite things I did when leveling when I started playing in BC was going to zones that were harder (orange level mobs) and try to quest there to get exta XP and enjoy the challenge. 

Now with the change to leveling in Shadowlands  (Which I do honestly like the ability to finish off an expansion before leveling out of it) the quests are kind of easy, and since I have done them for years they tend to be a bit repetitive. 

What I propose is heroic questing. Pretty much scale the difficulty of the MOBS in the world to be almost on par with say dungeon trash or weaker and the player receives extra XP, say an extra 15% to be on par with an heirloom or War Mode.  

The idea behind this was because people complain about the time spent on leveling  from 1 to 120 (soon the be 1-50) can take around 100 or so hours and can get kind of dry and forces you to constantly do dungeons for faster XP. I enjoy the stories in many of the zones and think this will give players an alternative way to level because even when Shadowlands comes out and we get the new leveling  we are still replaying the same content over again so I think making the same gameplay a bit harder would make it enjoyable for those enjoy leveling new characters. As it stands right now with full heirlooms I never need to party with someone to kill a quest mob regardless of my class or spec. This would encourage more players to group up when questing.v

Now I am unsure if this could decrease the amount of playtime it takes to reach max level but it would at least give players an option to make repetitive content a little more challenging. With the addition of Warmode in BFA I feel this would also appease the people who do not like PVP but still would like a bonus without getting ganked.

Feel free to tell me if this sounds ridiculous (or if this has been mentioned before) but I feel like this would be fun for people who like leveling ALTs.",10,1585598146,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frxxt4/heroic_questing_repost_since_shadowlands_is_coming/,wow,1

# Logs:

 [https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/pMZmbn8F2zfKtAj9](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/pMZmbn8F2zfKtAj9) 

This does not include our attempts on Il'gynoth the next night but we didn't end up getting him down this week either so I figured no reason to include it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fun Stats:

I had 2.6 million health out of combat.

1.61 billion of our 4.39 billion damage was from Twilight Devastation and Echoing Void (\~36%)

28-30 Bears on every fight except N'zoth. We made a few attempts on N'zoth with the full 30 but after 6 wipes we decided to drop the 10 lowest dps and 1 shot it with our 20-bear attempt (Still twice as many as last week!)

&amp;#x200B;

# The Fights:

***Wrathion*** \- This one is easy no real difference from a normal group.

***Skitra*** \- This one is also easy no real difference from a normal group.

***Maut*** \- This one is still fairly easy but has a major difference in strategy. Because we are unable to dispel the debuff maut puts out (Drain Essence) we actually cannot reasonably push Maut out of his shielding phase. (Also since some of us run as much as 40% of twilight devastation a single crit would kill us). So we do not damage maut during his obsidian skin phase. Instead we just keep ourselves topped off and pop a defensive before he explodes. As long as you have a barksin or SI or anything really up at the time of the explosion we survive. This means our maut fight takes far longer than a normal group but overall it works just fine still no real worry on berserk timer.

***Xanesh*** \- Very few people in our group knew the soccer mechanic unfortunately so we wiped once on this one. We only have to get soccer fight right once after that we can do similarly with maut and just defensive all the failed soccer attempts.

***Vexiona*** \- This one has no real difference from a normal group.

***Hivemind*** \- This one has no real difference from a normal group.

***Ra-den*** \- Being all melee is awkward for this fight but most of the fight has no difference from a normal group. Where ra-den gets interesting is in the last phase. If you didn't already know in his last phase Ra-den hits the tank with a debuff called 'Decaying Wound'. This debuff actually does damage based on your CURRENT health when it is applied. As you can imagine.. having 2.6 million health instead of a normal tank's 600-900k health.. makes this quite a difficult debuff to..... bear. (100% of your current health when applied is dealt to you every 2 seconds) so that is 1.3 million damage taken per second if it gets applied to me at full health. In order to deal with this we actually tank him in human form for last phase so that we have far lower health (about 1 million or so?) and so we have far lower defense so he can wail on us. Then once debuff is applied someone else taunts and we flip back to bear form and pop a frenzied regen and that usually keeps us alive (though as you'll see in video some fail this mechanic check and die).

***Drest'agath*** \- This one has no real difference from a normal group except that since we are all melee the maws are slightly more dangerous. Go-to strat is just apply all of our dots then run to next mob and then come back and re-apply later.

***Shad'har*** \- Oddly enough this is the hardest fight aside from Ilgynoth and N'zoth himself. I'm not entirely sure why I guess there is just a ton of passive damage or people are standing in stuff they shouldn't be but we always end up close to soft enrage (entire floor filled with poison) and with only like 10/30 bears left alive.

***Carapace*** \- This one is just easy and fun so much cleave.

***N'zoth*** \- As i mentioned above we had to drop down to 20 bears because in our 30 man we had some people going insane far too often and we were sometimes short on damage checks (not killing a tentacle before the poopoo creeps from psychus to it etc.). With the 20 bear group we 1 shot it. Overall our strats aren't any different than a normal group for this one either.",10,1585590602,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frvi2y/rarbearhands_back_with_another_allbear_heroic_aotc/,wow,1

frue9c,OldGromm,This week is the best time to unlock allied races,"Starting with the next weekly reset (Tuesday for US, Wednesday for EU), there will be a week-long buff called [Sign of the Emissary](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=225788/sign-of-the-emissary). This will apply to all characters automatically and increases all reputation gains from world quests by 50%.  
(This applies to both Legion and BfA world quests, but not to the 8.3 assault quests)

On top of that, the darkmoon faire is happening next weekend, which gives us access to the [WHEE!](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=46668/whee) / [Darkmoon Top Hat](https://www.wowhead.com/item=93730/darkmoon-top-hat) which grants an additional 10% reputation gains from all sources, not just world quests.

If you're using a [contract](https://www.wowhead.com/bfa-inscription-guide#contracts) (which grants 10 reputation points towards a specific faction when completing a world quest, 16 with all the buffs), you can grind towards a specific faction and reach exalted with them faster. They might be pricey depending on your server, and especially now with the emissary week coming up, but they're worth it.

If you're a new player, this is a good time to work towards unlocking flying (which requires being exalted with all factions except the 8.3 ones). If you already have flying, but have yet to unlock the other faction's allied races, now would be a good time to get started with a new character.  
If you don't want to level-up a new character just to unlock the other faction's allied races, you can take a shortcut and create a demon hunter who starts at level 98.  
If you already have a demon hunter, you can create a new one on another server. All you need is to have a level 70 character on that server, and that is quickly-done by creating a death knight (who starts at level 55) and level him up to 70 real quick.

One last tip for unlocking other faction's allied races with new characters: I advise waiting with doing the main storyline quests of the BfA factions until the darkmoon faire is up.  
The 10% extra reputation gained from completing the quests is especially-helpful if you want to unlock the Vulpera allied race. So be sure to have the darkmoon faire on you if you do that zone's questline.

It might be obnoxious to re-apply the darkmoon buff once every hour, but it is worth it since you safe time grinding for reputation later. Also, you only need the buff if you complete the quest at the NPC, not during the entire duration.

As for Legion allied races, if you use the darkmoon faire buff you can unlock Nightborne almost entirely by doing the lengthy questline, and a few world quests if they are available.  
Lightforged Draenei and Void Elves are tied to Argus reputations, but the Argus world quest reputation rewards have been increased in BfA (and remember, the darkmoon faire buff will boost the reputation gained from doing the main storyline quests here as well). So unlocking those shouldn't take too long either.  
Only one that will take a while to unlock are the Highmountain Tauren.

The other allied races require you to finish the 8.0 storyline as well as complete the war campaign, but that isn't affected by reputation and thus can be done later.

PS: According to u/xvrfel, [it would take roughly 17 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fq366h/how_many_daily_quests_spawn_in_each_bfa_zone/flqxcz5/) of doing all available world quests every day (as well as doing assaults and emmisaries) to get one BfA faction from Revered to Exalted without these buffs. If you're just getting started with a faction and you're still on Neutral with thim, it will take even longer than that.

If you focus on grinding world quests all day during next week, you can save quite a bit of time in the long run (up to 7 days if my math is correct). Just to put it into perspective how much you can gain from taking advantage of these buffs.",23,1585587094,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frue9c/this_week_is_the_best_time_to_unlock_allied_races/,wow,1

frtz5w,bearLover23,A few silly monk questions...,"So I am still relatively new to this game and I didn’t really consider playing MW until I heard a few things and now I’m VERY interested. But I have a few questions I hope some of you wonderful people can help me with :smiley: !

1: I heard Misweaver monk gives a 5% damage bonus to all group members.

So I am still new to this game but I come from FFXIV where I’ve played many utility based classes and a 5% damage bonus to the entire team is pretty huge and makes DPS REALLY high. Especially if it can be kept up.

I am wondering:

-Can MW monk keep it up forever?

-In WoW is 5% for the entire group really that good? In FFXIV that would be busted. But is it still dramatically weaker than say resto shaman with it’s damage totems and sutff?

-Do people really notice and like the buff? Like is it something people really do take note of and enjoy if you give it? Like in FFXIV if you want higher numbers you basically kiss your healer that gives you buffs.

2: Where is the healing dragon tower? I remember seeing gameplay years ago at this point where there was some sort of giant dragon tower. o_o;

3: What is fistweaving and is it really back? People said they really wanted it back and I don’t even know what it is if I’m being super honest…

4: What would be the best way to describe a mistweaver monk’s “healing style”? AOE? HoT? Burst single target? Delayed? Proactive? Reactive?

5: And are you able to multitask healing AND damaging and other tasks?

6: Is their utility, their 5 second duration wall thing, really that good?

frte9i,Anaro2270,I Just Soloed 5 mask vision run without any orbs as a MW Monk,"Hi, I've had a few people message me how I do visions as a MW Monk, I've been running them with a DPS friend mostly, but in fact, it's probably easier to do solo provided you have some DPS to back it up with, so go with whatever dps corruption you can find and use Way of the Crane essence (conflict and strife). Maut Trinket is also VERY useful for single target situations and it will help you kill bosses in just a few seconds. 

I have used my bloodlost for rexxar - also try to time your Gift of the Titans, depending on your cloak level, you should adjust how many masks you want to do, and once you have unlocked some of them, just use the Long Night as your last one (the 50 percent sanity reduction mask), the rest of the masks with the exception of the Daredevil are really easy and the only thing that matters is pretty much the health and the damage they add to mobs. 

Feel free to ask if you'd like some tips on how to run visions with your MW.

My computer has the specs to run WoW on fairly high settings, and prior to late January of this year I never had any issues with lag or frame drops, and would get a steady 60fps everywhere. Nowadays, my frames will seemingly at random drop to 10-20fps, and I've tried all the recommended solutions for fixing frame drops but it's been no use. I've turned my graphics settings down way below even the recommended, and the game still struggles to hold a constant framerate. 

Anyone have a solution? Or is this an issue with the game, in which case I'd need to wait for a patch?",4,1585581622,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frsp5b/insane_lag_spikes/,wow,1

I went to exactly the same place where others are able to meet him but there are two different characters there! Their names are Moriana Dawnlight and Doranel Amberleaf.

They sometimes say things like “Don’t get me wrong... I’m greatful to have Shando Stormage back, but this is all suspicious. What happened to Fandral? - Shh! Someone’s here.”

How can I find Mardant Strongoak? Is he somewhere else? Can I get new quests without completing this one?

frs7wk,shakazulu9912,Undercity deceased people thought,"Dear Sylvy Loyalists. So to serve the dark lady, it means that not only it will be when you are alive but also after you die, we see this happen in battle of undercity where she reanimated/resurrected the corpse of the horde and alliance to fight for her. But while the dead alliance soldiers serve the banshee queen in death only once, the horde soldiers have to serve her twice, since they were already fighting for her before they died. They are being subsequently brought back as skeletons to be thrown against the dark lady's enemies and it seems rather brutal. My question is for the Sylvanas' loyalists, what is so great about this? You serve and die for her, but then she doesn't let your soul depart to rest in peace, you are instead brought back as a skeleton to fight for her YET AGAIN. She has no problem throwing your skeleton as fodder at her enemies, she clearly doesn't value your corpse.

I must say i am astonished and excited with the changes however i am a bit confused with the main quest order and most provably i messed up things.

I started as a Daemon Hunter and progressed throughout the main story where i understood that i have to find the pillars of creation. From the war table in my hall i then opt my first hit pint to be  azsuna. Went there, did all quests and received my first pillar. Note here that due to the XP boost i reached level 110 by the time i finished my first pillar of creation.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is where it gets confused for me. When reached  Dalran,  Khadgar had an available quest for me ""Assault on broken shore"" which i decided to take. The cinematic on this quests starts with  Khadgar stating 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;with the pillars of creation assembled we have the power to cut the daemons...

This is where i lost it. How are the pillars of creation assembled since this is what i am suppose to do in this expansion. I mean my main objective is to gather those pillars and so far i only managed to get one of them (from Azsuna) so how are they assembled?

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed on my quest log a  new quest Legion Fall campaign with a list of three pillars (the fourth is missing provably because i obtained from Azsuna).

frnwlj,A_Confused_Cocoon,Class Concept: Tinker - Two Specs + Abilities/Talent Trees,"**Meta Prologue**: This was created through quarantine boredom. I actually never was honestly super interested in a Tinker class, but my mind got racing and I thought it could be fun to actually put one together. This class mirrors the Demon Hunter, two specs (DPS and Heals) with heavy flavor and fantasy built into the class, but also two very different specs. I went through Tinker' Lore in the game, as well as used abilities by Tinkers in WoW and designed abilities based off those. Balance wise, I did not add damage numbers or anything as that is not the real point. In theory, I did put rotations to mind and situational use for abilities, but I am by no means somebody who has been creating this with a group of people for months. More for fun than anything. With that being said, take a look.

Also, I did not add PvP Talents even though I did unintentionally create several while planning out these specs (I left them out of it). I apologize if that was of great interest to you.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tinker Overview**
 
The Tinker is a two spec ranged and healing class that manages **Steam** as a resource. As a Tinker, your abilities will build up steam and capping out on steam will temporarily reduce damage and healing output until it depletes. Several abilities, talents, and cool downs will allow you to more efficiently disperse Steam. Tinkers also benefit from expanded utility, creating technology that copies other class mechanisms, albeit at times less effectively.
 
The two specs are **Construct** (Ranged) and **Catalyst** (Healing). Construct revolves around building and maintaining turrets that are customizable for the situation at hand. Catalyst uses healing drones and use chemicals and gasses to stimulate restorative energies or prevent damage from occuring.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Tinker Races:**
 
Horde:

Orc - Originally holding some disdain for technology, working alongside the Goblins in Azshara and remnants of Garrosh’s Iron Horde have brought technophile Orcs into expanding their races abilities. 

Blood Elf - The Blood Elves, eager to prosper, use their arcane skills with studied technology to bring tinkers to their ranks. 
 
Goblin - The war for Azeroth through the Burning Legion and the Black Emprie has brought huge loss to all populations, Goblins included. Explosives are great, but research has been put into the medical field to keep their kind alive...and the Horde too.
 
Vulpera - Intelligent and being crafty scavengers, Vulpera have been studying goblin works for awhile and seek to impress the other Horde races with their abilities.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Alliance:

Human - Their close bond with Gnomes and Dwarves have paid off, allowing their race to quickly incorporate this technology with steadfast spirit.
 
Dwarf - While lacking efficiency and style, dwarves have no doubt created with brute output. They have worked with Gnomes to refine their own designs and bolster the strength of Gnome designs. 
 
Gnome - Already highly specialized, the incorporation of Mechagnomes has brought newfound progress to their ranks. 
 
Mechagnome - The encounters are Mechagon have brought new advancements to the other races in Azeroth, including to potential enemies of the Alliance that  they wish to serve. They strive to bring continued advancements to the faction.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Resource: Steam**  

Both Construct and Catalyst have a resource bar that goes from 0 to 100 (up to 125 with a leveled passive). Starting at 0, many abilities generate Steam and increase the bar over time. Steam naturally decays at 5 Steam per second. Once the bar caps and causes Overpressurization, the gadgets of the Tinker are temporarily hindered, reducing damage and healing output by 40% for 5 seconds as steam automatically depletes 20 (25) per second. The best Tinkers manage their steam effectively, never allowing it to Overpressurize. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Equipment:**

Tinkers use Mail Intellect armor. They can equip Guns, Bows, Crossbows, Maces, Shields, Axes, and Staffs. Construct (DPS) Tinkers require a ranged weapon to use several abilities. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

**DPS Spec Breakdown:**

&amp;nbsp;

**Construct** - Flavor: A master of improvisation and logical reasoning, the Construct harness their own creations and ammo load outs to effectively snipe, bombard, poison, freeze, burn, electrocute, and generally cause mayhem. 

&amp;nbsp;  

Meta: The Construct Tinker uses Ammo as a Druid uses forms or a Paladin used Auras. Want to blanket bomb an area, slowing the movement speed of many targets? Switch to Ammo: Ice and cast Air Support. Want to stun the enemies in the area instead? Spec into Ammo: Electric and stun all hit targets instead. Want to stack a healing reduction on an enemy? Ammo: Toxic and use Lock-On to burst it. Ammo is on a global 6 Second CD, but managing it will allow you to control the battlefield effectively and to your teams benefit.

**Healing Spec Breakdown**:

&amp;nbsp; 

**Catalyst** - Flavor: Your command over mechs is impressive to behold. An arsenal is before you, ready at a moment's notice to find friendlies and restore their vitality. Adaptability is key as you plan ahead to forthcoming challenges.

&amp;nbsp; 

Meta: The Catalyst uses drone support to empower their healing abilities, using created concoctions of gasses and injections to heal injured allies. They have a little of each healing type, but rely mostly on HoTs and Shields, with many abilities that redirect how damage is taken or when healing actually happens. Their Talent Tree also gives sense that Catalyst Tinkers directly work on and upgrade their arsenal and abilities, directly changing how their abilities interact.

&amp;nbsp; 

**Final Thoughts**: I tried to be creative with the designs and make them dissimilar to other classes. I choose Ranged DPS/Healing on purpose as no Ranged DPS has been added to the game since its creation, and only 1 Healer has been added compared to 3 tank specs.  I also tried to incorporate actual choice into the talent trees that felt like it would make a noticeable change in your gameplay. All in all, it was for fun and I enjoyed the time spent. I hope you all share your comments on it or any feedback/mistakes etc. If I missed anything (or missed any potential broken mechanics that I can better clarify).

frn7vv,Creepy-Cobbler,Wow cinematics in bfa - Mocap? 3d Face models?,"So I've recently become acquainted with the latest RE engine which uses 3d model scanning mocap from the face+ and body doubles wearing the costumes tailored for their character and body, and the voice actor's mocap for the lip syncing is also added. 

So for dmc 5 (just an example) it's 2 mocap actors that compile into the same character one is for the body and face and movements and the other is for the lip sync as far as I know. So reuben Langdon did voice acting and the lip sync mocap for dante but Adam Cowie was his face, facial expression and full body double and he didn't have to silently mouth all the Dialogue that was all reuben.
Back to the question, Is this how wow cinematics were made in bfa? I know anduin has an actual named face model, but did they actually scan in his whole body in the suit of armor and his real body movements, proportions  and expressions and did they use his voice actors lip sync mocap? Just a bit curious because when I look at cutscenes from the RE engine and the wow cinematics I see the same hyper realism? Not giving me uncanny valley vibes though so I suspect some mocap going on, but I can't pinpoint exactly if they went all out with using real people dressed in the custom tailored clothing and all...

...or used pure cgi for the humanoids especially with sylvanas' super fast moving. To me sylvanas looks like pure cgi with good lip syncing though, so the model may not be a real person but they may have used her voice actors mocap for her lip sync because it matches he unique little accent so well. Idk this kind of production stuff interests me! Or if my speculations are right.",0,1585558174,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frn7vv/wow_cinematics_in_bfa_mocap_3d_face_models/,wow,1

This probably seems like a stupid question, but, I've just returned to the game after 10 years off. (Thanks COVID lockdown boredom).

I created a new character, did a few quests to get to ""dungeon level"", then did a dungeon every time a new one popped up. . .

. .  the problem with this method is that I far out level the current expansion, before it's suggesting I move on to a new expansion that's more suitable for my level.

What's the best way to play to experience everything?

Is it best I just forget the exp associated and play through the content in a linear matter? Obviously I will be waaaaay past level cap before I finish BFA. (At this rate, with the double exp, I'll probably be in TBC or even classic zones before hitting 120).

frikfp,jerax42,[Stats included] Please make corruption more deterministic or you risk losing the player base that cares.,"Out of the 60 dungeons I did, I saw exactly 9 corrupted items drop...for everyone. **I got none. This gets even grimmer when I think about alts. Please believe me, I tried to farm.**

It's no lie, the layers upon layers of RNG are only here to extend this patch's life, it was the same story with essences and the grind, but I just can't scratch it - I just don't believe that they're not losing more people right now than they'd gain if they made this system a bit more deterministic.

It's been 8 weeks now. I haven't managed to get a single, not one single good corruption. I got the some decent ones, but it feels AWFUL having \~30%+ (and it'll keep increasing)  of your damage offset to RNG. As a person doing M+, my alt doesn't have TD/Gushing or anything that I could use for M+, not even IS for some boss fights - I am completely limited by my corruption.

Why not have a system that allows me to disenchant corrupted items for some currency that I can exchange for the ones I want?

I, for example, have stopped doing anything past the weekly clear and M+ nearly altogether because of it. It's just not fun going into a dungeon knowing I'll put everyone at a disadvantage just because I didn't get lucky and, frankly, I'm probably going to quit and everyone feels extremely unmotivated and as far as I know, no one is actively farming for corruption because they know it's shit.",6,1585535369,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frikfp/stats_included_please_make_corruption_more/,wow,1

Now from my guild experince and what we've noted the curse that goes off from the abyssal adds doesn't seem to tie into the absorb circles in terms of wether it goes off or not. Some say it does, other's don't, who cares as its just trash and its easy enough to get down. Well apprently this gods gift to the game monk does. So they corrected me in a know it all snarky way. Whatever don't care lets just kill the boss so I can be on my way. Well the dear of the monk decided to tell the RL to kick me over a damn trash abilitly, cause they know all. Which he did and they also chose to drive it even further with the know it all attitude of waving bye at me in game. Now I try to be cool and collected, although I do have a temper at times, and this set me off. First off kicking people based on something stupid like that, versus messing up the fight, shows why their 3/12 currently. Second, they had no grounds to stand on in the way they acted cause news falsh, their not 10/12 -12/12, nor are they 3100+io. Their sub-par currently, not saying they can't down more bosses and so forth as its a group thing, not a indivivual thing at times. Yet this really urks me when people act like snobbish elitists with no reason. Finally I said nothing to the monk to provoke this other than saying that circles don't tie into wether it casts or not. So I have no clue why they even acted this way other than to be a snobbish pest and kick somone for a frivilous reason, or just got off on a power trip.

So please, stop acting like you know it all and so forth, cause you don't unless you are 3100+ or 10/12+ and have seen it all in terms of boss abilites and trash.",4,1585532408,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frhttp/stop_being_toxic_your_not_gods_gift_to_the_game/,wow,1

frhqe4,ExcalibaX,New player main - Rogue vs Warrior?,"Hey there,

I recently started playing WoW and after playing around a bit with most classes and races I decided to roll a human Rogue (male). My second choice would have been a Warrior.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I hit 50 with my Rogue and to have a little break from leveling/exploring I was scrolling through the transmogs, seeing how the daggers, 1h swords, armor etc. could look like in the future. Out of curiosity I did the same for my Warrior. And now I am a bit conflicted.. might be just a temporary thing, but I felt like most of the 2h weapons (I am mainly into swords) looked dope AF and comparing the Fury Warrior (visuals) to the Outlaw felt a bit meh to me. I did find a few armors and weapons for my Rogue which I did enjoy, they are not bad at all, but in direct comparison, hm.. Now I do enjoy daggers which is why I initially went for the Rogue (Outlaw just feels too good leveling so far).

Visuals aside, I enjoy both class fantasies (RPG/exploring is important to me and one of the main reasons I am here, else I could just go and play some Esports instead of min/maxing here). Being invisible has been really fun so far with my Rogue and being that agile/sneaky silent killer. However, just seeing my low level Fury Warrior with his 2x2h swords feels so massive. Being that unkillable unit of destruction, a ronin exploring the world of Azeroth. Oh boy, how I hate being conflicted about chosing the first main. I wish I had a clear favorite.

&amp;#x200B;

frfqu5,kenthefin,Dear Blizzard,"Dear blizzard,

I hope someone at the company actually reads this and passes it along so the discussion can be had internally. I have been playing wow since vanilla like so many others. I’ve been through the good and the bad expansions. I’m begging you, DO NOT RUSH SHADOWLANDS. I’m willing to bet that if you sent out one of those poll surveys to all the retail players that the majority would agree. I would gladly wait till 2021 for shadowlands to be released as long as it released in good shape. World of Warcraft cannot suffer a BFA round 2. You HAVE to get this one right. Please please please just take your time. Push it back if you need. I’ll wait, I’ll even pay my sub fee even for when I’m not actually playing for the next 6-9 months or however long it takes for you all to be satisfied with shadowlands. Sure others will stop their subs but you know how this works, they drop off at the end of the expansion anyway. You need to be looking at the long term health of WoW. Let those numbers drop off a bit if you have to. Because I guarantee if you bust out all the stops and shadowlands is as good as we all want it to be, those numbers will surge like crazy, I’d bet a lot of the people only playing classic will want to try it if they hear it’s good. Your community, your fans, we all want this game to be great again. We all want it to be the thing that we think about all day while we are at work or school. That’s how it used to be. Let’s get back to it again. Take your time, make shadowlands great, your fans will still be here and they will always come back. 

Sincerely, a fan.",2,1585524588,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frfqu5/dear_blizzard/,wow,0

frfoj1,lordraz0r,Imagine WoW as a Single Player experience,"Now before I begin with my imaginary version of WoW let me give you some backstory. I've completely quit WoW during BFA. I doubt I'd ever be coming back but one thing I miss from WoW is the universe. WoW honestly crafted one of the coolest universes I've ever seen in a game.  
  
Now since quitting I've tried other MMOs like SWTOR which although finding it enjoyable I grew bored with then came my true eye opener... I did a complete playthrough of Witcher 3. I enjoyed running through the world as Geralt meeting and losing friends. I felt invested in the world and at times a very manly tear rolled down my cheek... That is when I realized I didn't feel like this about WoW in years.  
  
When I saw the city of Novigrad for the first time I was completely blown away. Here I was riding up to a truly massive city with an insane amount of detail and I was thinking to myself imagine Stormwind was like this... As I progressed through the story things changed. Some small things and some big and it really felt like my choices in the game mattered.  
  
Now imagine playing as a young Garrosh leading the armies of the mighty Horde to crushing the Alliance marching into Stormwind to personally deal the killing blow to their leader or imagine playing a young Anduin growing up to lead the armies of the Alliance to conquer Kalimdor and driving the Horde to the brink of extinction. Choices you make can actually shape the world you explore for better or worse.  
  
If you want to play a completely broken build that is OP wearing the best gear in the game you can and it won't mess with the experience anybody else would be having. You can wield the Twinglaives of Azzinoth and they would be truly unique and NPCs could react to them on your back. The game could look truly beautiful and have actual weather effects that look more realistic.  
  
The game could render way more NPCs without servers chugging along lagging out on the release of new content. I honestly would love for Blizzard to make such a game because after seeing what CDPR could do with way less resources and without the constraints of Witcher 3 being an MMO holding it back it made me realize how much I would enjoy such a series of games.",1,1585524357,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frfoj1/imagine_wow_as_a_single_player_experience/,wow,0

frfirw,vaynebot,Does anyone actually enjoy the horrific vision mechanics?,"I'll preface this by saying that I do actually like the idea of a challenge mode for 1-5 players. But the actual implementation of the mechanics just feels horrible to me. And I'm playing a DH, so pretty much the easiest or one of the easiest classes at least for 5-mask runs. And they are relatively easy, that's not the problem.

The problem is: It's just so annoying, even if you manage to do it! Every single mechanic in there seems to be designed to let you not play your character. Everything silences, fears, confuses, stuns, makes you jump somewhere or hard CCs you in some other way. It's infuriating. There's even a mob with a zero cast time instant polymorph, like WHAT? (He's optional at least, but still.) You can't even stand still for a while out of combat because of all the random shit that spawns on you!

Especially with 5 masks there are simply so many mechanics layered on top of each other that it becomes pretty much literally impossible to actually play the mechanics, and instead the ideal strategy has become to 1. wait until your titan proc is up for full immunity, 2. target proc it before a fight 3. ignore everything and just try to nuke the mob/boss. Which is IMO the opposite of satisfying - I *want* to play boss mechanics, that's what is fun!

And Blizzard showed they can do much better with the Legion mage tower. I mean some of the challenges had some issues to but overall they were really fun and way more interesting.

For 8.3 obviously it doesn't matter anymore, but I just hope that the announced Shadowlands ""infinite dungeon"" doesn't follow the same pattern in terms of mechanics. Getting chain CCed from one mechanic into the next and just waiting for some sort of immunity timer is not fun.",7,1585523766,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frfirw/does_anyone_actually_enjoy_the_horrific_vision/,wow,0

I realized that I got locked out of some hero board quests because I'm too high level to get them to show up, I know they aren't important but my OCD was killing me so I needed to find a way. Anyways I did.

So if you use the party sync feature every past quest should be available (granted some require quest chains to be done but that's besides the point). Even quests that you haven't done that you were locked out of such as hero board quests become available. What's great is if you complete any sort of quest that you haven't done, it still will count as a normal quest since you haven't done it, not a replay quest. So essentially if you ever get locked out of a quest you wanted to do just use party sync and you should be able to do it.",4,1585521690,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frexjj/how_to_complete_quests_that_youve_been_locked_out/,wow,1

frdrfq,BloodborneFTW,Quick question regarding weapon enchants.,"Hello all! Just want to ask about the best weapon enchant for my balance druid (i466). 

Wowhead prefers ""Quick Navigation or Torrent of Elements or Enchant Weapon - Machinist's Brilliance depending on gear (it's most likely brilliance)."" However, Icyveins says Torrent of Elements followed by Masterful Navigation (for 5+ targets). 

I've tried to sim to see the difference but Mr Robot doesn't seem to have an option to test enchants, and I'm not sure how to sim this on Raidbots without the script method (if I misunderstand, please tell me).

What's more, I heard fron multiple casters in raid that Torrent is the best, but on other occasions, I've heard the opposite.

I understand it's a minimal difference, but every bit counts. Thanks in advance!",4,1585517532,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/frdrfq/quick_question_regarding_weapon_enchants/,wow,0

I don't want to start joining dungeons etc... with awful gear, and annoying everyone because I'm slacking or whatever.

As we all know, there's a ton of profession and cosmetic stuff hidden behind only-occasionally-available world quests: Profession recipes for example, as well as cosmetics (Legion and BFA) only found through certain emissaries, and so on. The Legion Archaeology rotation and world bosses could be considered similar.  


Is there any app or site where you can get notified upon certain of these being available? The closest I've seen is that Wowhead has a ""this stuff is up"" website, but their interface for looking at currently active profession quests is lacking at best, possibly even completely broken. And with the number of different professions, I really don't want to log in every single alt twice a day to see if there's a profession quest up that'll give them a recipe they don't have yet.

After having been heavily into professions since Vanilla, I've pretty much languished since Legion due to this whole ""let's log in and see what activities the game allows you to do today"" approach to non-raiding gameplay.

fr8er1,JoshYaxley,Introducing player scores: quick indicators for overall mechanical performance in raids," Hi all,

For those that don't know me, I'm the creator of a raid analysis tool called [Wipefest](https://www.wipefest.gg/). Wipefest's aim is to help raid teams reach their full potential. Wipefest provides concise breakdowns of the major events in a pull, as well as a team's mechanical performance.

I've been developing [Wipefest](https://www.wipefest.gg/) for 3 years now, and one goal I've had is to be able to calculate a score for players that rates their mechanical performance. Building such an algorithm isn't simple, and I wanted to make sure that the calculation was 100% data-driven, backed by statistics, and void of any personal opinions or bias.

A year and a half ago, I added the feature to see percentiles for mechanics. These indicate how well your team is performing compared to other kills. A couple of months ago, I added an algorithm that could work out which mechanics are more important than others for each boss ([see here for a write-up I did of how that works](https://medium.com/wipefest/i-wrote-an-algorithm-to-calculate-the-most-important-boss-mechanics-8d2dc4b5ae4)). Building on top of these two concepts, I've now added a way to calculate a score for each player's specific performance on a mechanic, and a way to weight these by the mechanic's importance and combine them into a single number that can be used at a quick glance to indicate how well you're performing. This score takes into account damage taken, debuffs gained, interrupts, soaks, healthstones, potions, etc.

I'll likely do a write-up of some of the specifics of this algorithm, but, for now, let's see what this looks like!

On the ""Players"" tab of any fight summary (including analysed multi-pull reports for subscribers), there's now a collection of player cards that show these scores:

*Processing img bb5ocsrjzmp41...*

If you have your summary filtered to ignore events after a certain number of deaths, these scores will also update appropriately.

*Processing img 9htlatrkzmp41...*

By combining this with the details in the ""Mechanics"" tab, you can get a pretty good idea of where improvements can be made.

*Processing img mwvq1yhmzmp41...*

Subscribers also get access to a table that breaks down performance per-player and per-mechanic:

*Processing img wzg3u6hozmp41...*

This table lets you filter out certain mechanics. For example, if you are progressing on a new boss, you might not expect everyone to have chance to use all their potions and healthstones if they were saving them. Or, if not everyone is assigned to soak a mechanic, you might want to exclude that to be able to compare more easily:

*Processing img tjdu1rbqzmp41...*

The colors in the table indicate performance, with green being a perfect score of 100, and red being the lowest score of 0. You can hover over cells in the table to get the exact score if needed:

https://preview.redd.it/6vqxbvkrzmp41.png?width=267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=feda73a26e53c5d077a47dd061e680a5b82c611b

You'll notice that the player score features are still marked as ""Beta"". I'd love any feedback on these. How useful are they? Could they be displayed better?

I'd also be interested to hear if anyone has any interesting ideas on how this score could be used or what could be built on top of or around it.

* Would it be helpful to show these on character pages so that you can see a player's score for every boss alongside their Warcraft Logs percentiles?
* What about a guild view that shows the scores for each boss for every player in your guild?

And, just like damage and healing percentiles, take this score with a pinch of salt! It exists as an indicator and to help direct where your next investigations might want to be. Your tactics, assignments, and certain class abilities might all have an impact on what a player's score could be, so keep those in mind when evaluating!

Thanks everyone!

fr6bru,movimento9,Psychological / Socialization Aspect of Group Finder Solo-Queueing vs Real Groups,"Though this may be a bit odd I’m wondering if anyone relates to this. First of all, I work in sales... and love what I do so socializing IRL is never an issue.

For a long time I always felt like I would become exhausted after a 2 or 3 hour stint of either RBGs or arenas or mythic + and immediately need to log off. However recently I learned it’s not the game itself, it’s maintaining the upbeat personality / being high performance in front of the same exact group of people nonstop without stopping.

During the quarantine I’ve been home a lot with more time to play WoW, and found that when I get a burning desire to quit and log off after 10 games in a row, it’s actually because I no longer want to queue on the group’s time, have to be liable to what the group wants, and can’t just “do my own thing”... I’ve been solo queueing random battlegrounds or just changing PUG arena groups every 5 games and that pressure has completely lifted and I can literally play for like 12 hours without stopping. LFR, random bgs, arena skirmishes... I can play for HOURS and it’s nonstop fun. In a real group I cannot do this because I become so exhausted.

I feel like when I solo queue, I can just hop into a game whenever I want and be whoever I want to be without maintaining the same level of intensity or “personality” the entire time. I can just chat when I want to chat, or say very little in voice chat and no one cares because they don’t even know me. It’s very exhausting to stick around with the same people all day, and very easy to jump into a new group every single game.

I guess it’s weird because you’d imagine yourself as shy around new people, and comfortable around the same groups after a while, but for me, solo queueing feels like pure freedom and I just do whatever the fuck I want when I want.

Because of this I often find myself turning my online status from ON to OFF and saying bye to my friends but still playing the game for 6 more hours afterward. Anybody else get this way they just wanna be left alone to do their own thing in the game and can’t stand to queue another game with the same exact people over and over? 

How do you guys deal with this if you experience it? Am I alone in thinking solo queue is 50x more enjoyable and “free” feeling? Or is this game revealing some sort of antisocial disorder even though in real life I experience none of these symptoms...

fr5a95,Chewiziwinz,How do I get back into raiding ?,"Hi everyone,

(English is not my first language)

I got back into WoW about a week ago, having stopped since the end of Battle for Dazar'Alor because everyone in my guild progressively stopped playing. I raided with them since Legion, and some players since the beginning of MoP. Problem is: I can't seem to get back into raiding. I just want to progress/clear the last raid on heroic difficulty and do some mythic bosses after that, just like I did before I stopped playing.

The problem is: No guild wants to recruit a player who just came back now, because they don't want a player who comes to get his achievement and then leaves. 

They (the 5 guilds i tried joining) want me to get heroic level gear and the curve achievement BEFORE I join them, but doing it the PuG way takes hours uppon hours.

I spend hours creating groups noone tags to or being refused to raid groups that do content appropriate for my item level because ""lol where's your curve?"".

I can't do decent M+ keys because ""lol look at your rio"". Yes it's bad, because I never cared about it, I never needed it in my former guild. (And we easily cleared +15s back in dazar Alor)

 My essences are late but I am farming as much as I can to get them to where they need to be. My ilvl is getting there, farming hard, but it takes sooooooo long compared to doing it with guildies.

Maybe my problem is my mentality, I was used to doing everything with my guildies and rarely ever playing with people outside of my former guilde (and i remember why now).

 Yet every guild I talked to expects me to get to their level of itemization on my own, in PuG dungeons and raids. Aren't guilds supposed to help with that ? 

I'm not asking for a carry, just a place in a guild where I can join some  appropriate M+ keys and some alt raids to get some decent gear until I am eventually allowed to come for the heroic/mythic raids.

&amp;#x200B;

So am I the problem ? Is it to be expected to farm the gear on my own ? Are guilds not supposed to help (and I insist on HELP, not carry) me ? Anyone else in my situation ?

fr3cbt,Ze_Germansss,"As a new player, I'm really not enjoying being 120","Sorry, I don't mean for this to be an inflammatory post because my way to 120 I enjoyed immensely, I genuinely haven't enjoyed a game like this in *years* but hitting 120 has been like running into a brick wall for me. I hit 120 before the 100% buff was up but only recently got time to finally keep working on my character and now, a few days in, I'm ready to throw in the towel and level something else. 

Game started out as a focused, tight experience that perfectly kept me engaged without overstaying its welcome. Each zone felt the perfect length, dungeons were enjoyable because everyone was sort-of on the same level and very much dependent on each other, with variances in the odd wonky scaling of specs and some heirloomed vets who went ham, I always felt like I had a place in these runs. Getting gear, despite it being at this level, was satisfying and felt somewhat meaningful and I was always working towards that mighty goal of 120, where the world was, in my mind, getting even better!

Now after hitting 120, I'm absolutely inundated with with what feels like millions of quests that I have no explanation, rhyme or reason for why I'm doing them. What is this leading to, what is my reward at the end of this? What am I supposed to be doing that is even relevant to me? Oh a war campaign, sounds mighty and epic... and all I've done is ride and fly around Horde zones for hours, doing something for 5-10 minutes only to spend more time riding through entire zones getting dazed along the way, then watching lengthy talks about God knows what. I feel like I'm doing nothing, I almost want to scream that I need some action soon, an objective I actually want to achieve.

Then I break up the monotony by trying to join some dungeons, at least those are enjoyable right... until I realize every run is just players overgeared to high heaven, especially with the new corruption items, they could basically solo these things. Every single run I'm basically just trying to keep up. I have no place here, not doing anything of meaning or contributing a thing, I'm just there to look at the scenery and get some loot. Why isn't there an option to get paired up with people around your experience / ilvl?

World quests? Oh great, lets me kill and do some things! Arrive and they are full of people basically carrying you through most of the experience. Boss? Tag him and he's dead 2 seconds later. Clear an area? Everything is being murdered and I just need to tag things as quickly as possible.

Don't think I've even had to think about executing my rotation since I hit 120 because nothing stays alive long enough of everything I've done, just mindlessly getting carried around doing nothing of meaning, it feels like. 

As a new player, I feel like 'I have no place in this world', everything I enjoyed has gone out of the window and I get the feeling that I need to do the above content for *weeks*, just to reach a plateau where I'm relevant and caught up in this world, which is difficult when I have no carrot for it and already burned out. 

Anyone been through this, got any advice, the mighty carrot that kept you going or the words of wisdom that changed your perspective? Because this has been an immense disappointment for me, thus far.",870,1585474615,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fr3cbt/as_a_new_player_im_really_not_enjoying_being_120/,wow,1

I’m completely helpless as I cast my frostbolt at the rogue who’s poking my eyes out. Or the demon hunter who’s melting my face off. As soon as I am out of blinks and they get within range of me, I have no hope of survival other than ice block.

&amp;#x200B;

Now after that long list you might be confused with the results, let me explain in sections.

&amp;#x200B;

**Humans, Undead, Dwarfs and Gnomes (including allied race counterparts)**

It can be debated whether the four races are truly native to Azeroth or not and that's because of the war between the Old Gods and the Titans. The Titans saw the World Soul of Azeroth being corrupted by the Old Gods who were servants of the Void, if you're curious to why the Old Gods would want to corrupt a World Soul, that's because if a Void-Powered Titan were to ever exist it would be the most powerful thing creation has ever witnessed. The Void wishes for the end of existence and what better way to do that than to make a Void-Powered Titan? The Void Lords (it's pretty much in the name of what they are) tried to corrupt the awakened Titans but failed, so they turned their attention to corrupting a sleeping Titan, which is what we call a World Soul. The Void Lords couldn't find a way to figure out which planets had a sleeping Titan and which didn't so they just threw pieces of themselves on random planets hoping to get lucky at least once. These pieces of themselves are what we know as the Old Gods, and if you're curious why the Void Lords didn't corrupt the planet themselves that's because Void Lords are kind of in their own realm and can't fully come into existence, but if they did their power could possibly rival the Titans. The Old Gods started to corrupt the planet when the Titan Aggramar took notice and informed the Pantheon. The Titans were too big themselves to take care of it so they made Titan constructs out of the crust of Azeroth itself. The war raged on and the Titan constructs were having trouble with Y'Shaarj (Ya-sha-raj) so Aman-Thul just ripped him out of the planet which created the Well of Eternity which in turn severely damaged Azeroth. So the Old Gods had to be imprisoned instead since if they were ripped out it would kill the World Soul. Now you might be asking me, where do the four races fit into all of this? and that's a good question, the answer to that is The Curse of Flesh that the Old Gods created from their prisons that afflicted the Titan constructs turning them into fleshy beings of the three races. The reason it's debated if they're native or not is because the only reason they exist is because of the Titans. Undead are just Undead humans so they fit in with the other three races unless they're Undead Elves like Sylvanas then they're native.

**Humans, Undead, Dwarfs and Gnomes TL;DR:** The four races were originally Titan Constructs afflicted with the Curse of Flesh which made them into the Humans, Dwarfs or Gnomes depending on physical appearance. Undead are just Undead Humans but for Undead Elves they are native to Azeroth.

&amp;#x200B;

**Trolls (including Zandalari Trolls)**

*Trolls -* Not much can be said about this race because they were in most historical events and likely evolved from the native wildlife of Azeroth. 

*Zandalari Trolls -* Zandalari are the most powerful tribe of Trolls but you could probably tell that from the architecture of Dazar'alor in Zandalar compared to, for example, Zul'Gurub or the Echo Isles in Durotar.

&amp;#x200B;

**Elves (all types of Elves including allied races)**

*Night Elves -* Let's start with the original Elves, the Elune worshipping Night Elves. These Elves evolved from Trolls that made their home close to the Well of Eternity and eventually were transformed into Night Elves. Trolls are native to Azeroth so that makes Night Elves native. 

*Highborne -* Now the Highborne which are not a playable race but an ancient civilization of Elves, these were the higher ups of the Elf civilization one to mention for instance is Queen Azshara before she was corrupted by N'Zoth along with her citizens which we now call the Naga. 

*Blood Elves -* Now onto Blood Elves, after the War of The Ancients when Azshara summoned the Legion into Azeroth which led to the Sundering the left over Highborne were exiled from the Night Elves because they continued to use Arcane magic after it was banned. They got on a boat and sailed to the far north of the Eastern Kingdoms where they made the city of Quel'thalas and it's capital Silvermoon. The Arcane magic they used and the left over essence of the Well of Eternity that they made into the Sunwell turned them into what they now called themselves the High Elves, and they lived like this for thousands of years until the Scourge came and attacked Quel'thalas to resurrect Kel'Thuzad as a Lich. With 90% of the High Elven population destroyed Kael'Thas the current prince but now king of Quel'thalas at the time changed their name to Blood Elves in honor of all who died during the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas. 

**Blood Elf TL;DR:** Night Elves get kicked out of Kalimdor for practicing Arcane magic now calling themselves High Elves and eventually get attacked by the Scourge, who wipe out 90% of the High Elf population. Kael'Thas renames High Elves to Blood Elves.

*Void Elves -* The Void Elves are pretty much just Blood Elves who were exiled from Quel'Thalas for practicing the dark magics of the Void, found their way to a place known as Telogrus Rift where they eventually unlocked a cube containing Nether-Prince Durzaan, a corrupt Ethereal who almost destroyed the Sunwell a second time during the Nightborne being integrated into the Horde. Durzaan made an attempt to corrupt Umbric (who was the leader of the Blood Elves who were practicing Void magic) and his followers before Alleria stopped him but not before Umbric's followers were transformed into the Void Elves, they were not fully corrupted but were now more likely to fall victim to the whispers of the void but from Alleria they learned that the whispers and promises the Void offered couldn't be trusted, instead they joined the Alliance when Alleria offered them a place there.

**Void Elf TL;DR:** Blood Elves get kicked out Quel'Thalas for practicing Void magic, Alleria helps them kill a corrupt Ethereal named Nether-Prince Durzaan who transforms the Void practicing Blood Elves into Void Elves.

*Nightborne -* The Nightborne were originally Night Elves who used the essence of the Well of Eternity to make the Nightwell that would sustain them throughout the War of The Ancients and thousands of years after along with making a magical barrier around their city to hide themselves from the rest of the world because they did not seek to join the Legion as Azshara who lusted for power did. Somewhere around 10,000 years later the Nightborne's shield came down as the Legion came back to conquer Azeroth yet again, the leader of the Nightborne named Grand Magistrix Elisande was offered to join the Legion or be destroyed, Elisande chose to join the Legion but was later killed in a resistance led by First Arcanist Thalyssra along with the Horde and Alliance.

**Nightborne TL;DR:** Night Elves who opposed Azshara and made a magic well out of the Well of Eternity, and then made a magic barrier around their city to protect them from the Legion. Leader of Nightborne Elisande pairs with the Legion and later gets killed by a resistance of Nightborne led by First Arcanist Thalyssra along with the Horde and Alliance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Orcs (including the Mag'har Orcs)**

*Orcs -* The Orcs heritage (along with the Magnaron, Gronn, Ogron and Ogres) can be traced all the way back to a mountain, you read that correctly. Allow me to elaborate, Aggramar the Titan came across Draenor (which is the planet the Orcs come from) and saw the Evergrowth which was the nature of Draenor that became out of control and would make Draenor a dead planet if not dealt with. Aggramar proceeded to use the elements to breathe life into the biggest mountain on Draenor, he named this creation Grond. Grond took down 3 Sporemounds which were basically the brains of the Evergrowth, one was unnamed but the others were Zang and Naanu before the final Sporemound who was named Botaan, after absorbing the left over life force of it's fallen kin finally killed Grond. Grond's body eventually formed the Colossals which Aggramar enhanced, they had many battles with the Evergrowth but eventually killed Botaan by exploding themselves on top of the Sporemound which ended much of their kind before finally becoming extinct centuries later possibly by the hands of the Thunderlord Clan of Orcs. In their battles with Botaan the Colossals had pieces of themselves cut off of them, these came to be the Magnaron who didn't share as much interest in destroying the Evergrowth as the Colossals did. The Magnaron eventually devolved into the Gronn, Ogron, Ogres and Orcs. The Orcs around 800 years later became corrupted by the power of Fel and destroyed Draenor by summoning so many portals that the planet could not handle such power that it tore itself apart, the following explosion transformed Draenor into what we now call Outland.

**Orc TL;DR:** Aggramar the Titan figures out that the nature of Draenor is out of control and makes a giant Grond to take care of it, Grond dies Colossals spring from his dead body and kill the final brain of the Evergrowth. Magnaron which are pieces of Colossals devolve into Gronn, Ogron, Ogres and Orcs. Orcs get corrupted by Fel and turn Draenor into Outland

*Mag'har Orcs -* These were the Orcs that came from the alternate universe of Draenor, the backstory of Grond up until the Fel corruption fits into their lore.

&amp;#x200B;

**Draenei (including Lightforged Draenei)**

*Draenei -* Originally named the Eredar their homeworld was on Argus and their leaders were Prophet Velen, Kil'jaeden, and Archimonde. Sargeras is recruiting leaders for the Burning Legion and sees the Eredar who seem like good enough soldiers and their leaders he was most interested in. Sargeras offered the three leaders of the Eredar to join the Legion but Velen saw through this. Kil'jaeden and Archimonde however joined the Legion without heeding Velen's warnings. Velen and his followers who now called themselves the Draenei fled on their ship to Draenor which was an unnamed planet until the Draenei called it Draenor. Nothing particular happens up until the events leading up to the Dark Portal other than Kil'jaeden seeing Velen not joining the Legion as a betrayal and trying to find him. On Draenor is where Kil'jaeden eventually finds Velen, Kil'jaeden sends the now Fel corrupted Orcs to destroy the Draenei, many were killed but some survived by hiding out in what was most likely Zangarra in Talador. Draenei souls were sacrificed to open a portal to Azeroth and the first and second war happen which eventually ends up with the Draenei joining the Alliance.

**Draenei TL;DR:** Draenei led by Velen, Kil'jaeden and Archimonde. Sargeras offers the three a place in the Legion, Velen refuses but Kil'jaeden and Archimonde accept. Kil'jaeden hunts Velen to Draenor and sends Orcs to slaughter all Draenei on the planet. Velen and other Draenei hide out somewhere in Draenor (likely Zangarra in Talador). Dark Portal opens and Draenei join the Alliance.

*Lightforged Draenei -* Most of the things above still apply except that the Lightforged Draenei are Draenei who joined the Army of The Light who were an order of those most committed to stopping the Legion, these Draenei undertook a ritual to take the essence of the Light into their bodies. After the events of Legion with Argus being free of the Legion's grasp they joined the Alliance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Worgen**

The first Worgen were actually Night Elf Druids trying to use the uncontrollable Pack Form that embodied the Wolf Ancient named Goldrinn who was so uncontrollable that not even Malfurion Stormrage the most powerful Night Elven Druid himself could not control the Pack Form that embodied Goldrinn. These beasts were created during the War of The Satyr when Night Elves tried to control the Pack Form for use against the Satyrs they tried to use Elune's magic to control it with the Scythe of Elune but this didn't work as planned and in turn made the Night Elf Druids partaking in the ritual turn into Worgen and if they bit any humanoid creature such as Night Elves or Humans they would turn into Worgen as well which was named the Worgen Curse. When Malfurion figured out about the Worgen Curse he sent the Worgen to the Emerald Dream where they would sleep forevermore. They did sleep until a Gilnean Archmage named Arugal awoke the Worgen to fight the Undead armies. This worked very well but backfired when the Worgen started to attack the Gilneans turning them into Worgen and eventually turned the entire city into Worgen. The Worgen eventually figured out how to control the inner rage of the beast with the help of the Scythe of Elune and some Night Elves 

**Worgen TL;DR:** Druid's Pack Form is uncontrollable, War of The Satyr happens and Pack Form is needed. Pack Form is attempted to be controlled but accidentally creates Worgen. Worgen Curse (much like werewolf bites) exists, Malfurion imprisons the Worgen inside the Emerald Dream. Worgen get summoned to fight Undead, Worgen turn on Gilneans. Worgen eventually are able to control themselves again with help from Night Elves.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tauren (including Highmountain Tauren)**

*Tauren -* Tauren are native to Azeroth and come from the continent of Kalimdor most prevalently in Mulgore and The Barrens. Tauren don't have much lore other than they fought with the centaurs and that they are a very peaceful people who respect nature and the Earth Mother which is just another name for Azeroth.

*Highmountain Tauren -* These Tauren are much like the original Tauren but instead of being in central Kalimdor they come from the Broken Isles and fight with the harpies instead of the centaur. These Tauren have antlers instead of horns and that's because Huln Highmountain who was a hero in the War of The Ancients and his homeland was even named in his honor. During the war Huln saved a moose who was favored by the Stag Ancient Malorne after doing so he got a blessing from the Demi-god Cenarius who was the child of Elune and Malorne which gave him and his people the blessing of Cenarius that meant that they would have the favor of Cenarius forever and the antlers that the Highmountain Tauren have.

**Highmountain Tauren TL;DR:** Hero of the War of The Ancients Huln Highmountain saves a moose favored by the stag ancient Malorne that gives him and his people the antlers that they have and also Cenarius' favor.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goblins**

Not much is to say about Goblins other than they are native to Azeroth and likely evolved from the natural wildlife there along with the other native races. Goblins come from the island of Kezan which is near the Maelstrom. Goblins are skilled in making technology from what other races (especially Gnomes) consider to be garbage which makes them resourceful. Goblins are of course very greedy and clever too.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pandaren**

These bear creatures were one of the first races along with the Burning Blade Orcs to develop the class called Monks. The last emperor of the Pandaren was one who learned many lessons in his time trying to prevent the extinction of his race from the Legion and the Sundering, his name was Emperor Shaohao. Shaohao saw that his people hadn't yet learned the lessons he had learned and that they needed time to learn the lessons he had learned. He sacrificed himself to make the mist of Pandaria that protected his people from the Legion and the Sundering and also gave them the time that they needed to learn the lessons he had. During the events of Mists of Pandaria the Pandaren were given a choice to join the Horde or Alliance, so they split into groups for the Horde they were the Huojin and for the Alliance they were the Tushui.

**Pandaren TL;DR:** Pandaren were one of the first races to develop the teachings of being a Monk. Demons threatened Azeroth so the last emperor of Pandaria sacrificed himself to make the mist that surrounds Pandaria to protect his people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vulpera**

Vulpera are small humanoid and fox-like creatures that come from Vol'dun in Zandalar and are native to Azeroth who most likely evolved from foxes because of their physical appearance. These small creatures have survived in the desert for quite a long time though, the sands of Vol'dun didn't exist long ago until a C'Thrax named Mythrax The Unraveler came to Zandalar to kill anything he could and to break the seal holding the artificial Old God G'Huun who Mythrax served. Destroying this seal turned Vol'dun into a desert but Sethraliss the Loa (Troll word for Wild God) that the Sethrak, and some groups of Trolls, worshiped sacrificed herself to kill Mythrax shortly after he destroyed the seal in Vol'dun. Vulpera are also very resourceful seeing as how their race has survived in the desert for around 16,000 years when the sands started to spread.

**Vulpera TL;DR:** They're fox-like creatures that have survived in the sands of Vol'dun for somewhere around 16,000 years when a seal holding G'Huun in his prison was destroyed.

fqykgk,JamieOctopus,Cant Decide Class,"TLDR: Cant decide the class i want to play talk about the merits/demerits of classes or even just your class lore and game play wise

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I cant decide the class i want to play at all i feel like I can get into pretty much any class and enjoy it i've played all of them at one point or another they all have there merits and demerits I just cant decide

Warriors: any race plate can wear pretty much all weapons/Armour i love the aspect of fury warriors being able to dual wield 2 handers will never not be jealous about that on other melee classes

Paladins: hybrid so good for whatever you need most of the time my least played class still enjoy them just my friend mained that one and we try not to play the same class

Hunters: fun easy to get into whenever again any race huge, kite ability  Mail Armour so don't usually needa fight over Armour with other classes too much getting new pets especially in Beast Mastery is always fun.

Rogue: Stealth Huge plus always fun to just get around pick-pocketing  a lot of random utilities like grappling hook though Spec specific makes it fun to get around

Priest: another one of my lesser played classes have leveled from start to max though cause i wanted heritage armour and wanted a change of pace pretty fun the lore around them is pretty cool too will never not love using mind control having 2 different healer specs is cool if i ever feel like healing but want to try a different type 

Shaman: Not bad though Enhancement is pretty weak atm and thats what i usually play on shammys i still enjoy it mail armour like hunters so rarely if ever needa fight over transmogs but since there is only 2 classes with mail cant always trade gear cause no one else has any you need or vice versa

Mage: one of my mains the last couple expansions casting was/is pretty fun love the slow fall/blink incase of accidental dismounts or just trying to get away from mobs/players i like the lore and just the feel of mages in general in the wow universe though thats for most casters in games just dealing with magic and the like of things not in real life

Warlock: pretty much the edgy mage haahaha jk jk but i loved warlocks prelgeion demo especially havent really been able to get too into demonologies new style but have enjoyed it would have rather a new spec not an overhaul love the burst on Destro and the slow burn on affliction

Monk: Surprisingly fun to play and another hybrid class which is great its leather so that can be good or bad in situations love how there weapons sheath on there backs all the time there lore for me is a little meh but there still fun to play with pretty good mobility which is always a plus for me

Druid: i have an on off relationship with druids haha I love how versatile they are any role supreme hybrid with long and short range dps awesome how they can stealth as well i think there lore is pretty cool i can get into it

Demon Hunter: Love there mobility double jump and wings and everything about them makes you just seem like youre so much more faster and more mobile than any other class i mained them at the start of legion like most people haha of course i love there lore as well though don't know if there lore will ever expand more and one thing that feels weird for me is how small there rotations feel and how little abilities they have might just be me though

Death Knight: my other proper main beside mages i mained it almost as soon as they came out i adore there lore love the feel of it love how it plays but going to any other class you feel like you are a snail and ive tried to mend it with little things like engineering boots and sometimes speed armour on transmog runs if i can ever find any but still feel slow af

&amp;#x200B;

All in all i can get into all there lore which is a big plus for me except maybe monks feel kinda shallow lore wise and pallys while there lore is awesome it just feels a little idk fanatic to me which isnt all that bad to be honest in a fantasy game so anyways what do you all think about the classes in wow or youre class in general?",6,1585450840,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fqykgk/cant_decide_class/,wow,1

I hate the controls. Every MMO I've played for the last 10 years has been action combat, and the controls just feel awful.  
So i tried to find an addon that would allow a mouse follow, and targeting.  And I did!   Console port. Which does a lot of what i want, but its supposed to be for a controller.

I want the camera to follow the mouse. I want to have an interaction button. I want to target things in front of me.

TL:DR does anyone know of settings for console port to still use mouse/keyboard but with all the action combat elements... OR can anyone recommend a different way to achieve this?",6,1585449714,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fqyael/returning_to_wow_and_console_port/,wow,1

As someone who just recently got into this game a couple of months ago when classic came out. I had my fill there, got to about level 40 and went to retail when shadowlands was announced. My time on both retail and classic I enjoyed heavily. I loved going around on retail doing dungeons and collecting old transmogs and playing at my own pace. The reason I struggle to enjoy my time is the feeling that I’m getting in too late. At this point people are constantly shit talking every aspect of wow and telling me that I shouldn’t play the game and it’s ass. While in my own perspective I’m struggling to see what the big deal is just because I haven’t played from the beginning and don’t realize what wow could be. As someone who came from the destiny community the experience wow has offered me in this short time is far greater than anything I got from 6 years of bungies stubbornness. What I’m trying to get at is that I feel like I’m wasting my time on a 15 year old game that everyone is telling me that’s gonna be dead in a year.

fqu5fk,ProUnicycler,"Altoholics that finally chose a main, which class did you go with?","I'm a relatively new player (started playing at the butt end of Legion) and I've played most classes all the way to level 120 (unless they were THAT intolerable) while switching specs every 5 levels. 

I ended up choosing Monk as my main, finally! Right before Shadowlands no less. Every spec feels very nice to play and is quite different from other classes. For example: BrM stagger mechanic, WW combo strikes and resource management, and Mistweavers unique theme and style. Monk isn't my favorite theme-wise or lore-wise, but they play the best I think.

Classes that I hated so much I couldn't bother leveling them past a certain point:

-

-

-

Druid, level 70.
 
- Theoretically this should be my favorite class due to so many options but there's just so many downsides for me. 

- Outdated forms are painful to look at and needing to use an artifact appearance to change that sucks because it only applies to one form. 

- Very limited changes to travel forms through glyphs. 

- Don't like the race options (I play Alliance)

- The specs are really boring to me, I found myself literally falling asleep because I was so bored playing Guardian spec.

-

-

-

Shaman, level 66.

- Shaman is actually not that bad, I really enjoyed resto. I just got tired of how both dps specs are so reliant on RNG. A lot of specs are, but I feel like enhance takes the cake. 

-

-

-

Priest, level 54.

- Sooooooo slow. So incredibly slow. 

- Two healing specs, very hard to play this class just for that reason. I can see having two dps specs as an option, but two for healing? Might be great if you love healing but more than 1 spec for that role would be wasted on me.

- Not super into the theme. Would be cool if I could just choose to be entirely deVOID (ha, get it?) of any light magic.

-

-

-

Mage, level 47

- Honestly I just got distracted. Should probably pick the class back up and try it out but I knew it wouldn't be main material due to 3 DPS specs. Only complaint is that they're squishy. 

-

-

I'm Siegfried and brand new to WoW. I would appreciate some advice and help on a complex matter. I bought this to play with people who I thought were decent friends who just ended up abusing me and treating me like garbage. The guild they have has some members but it's never active and have actively told me they won't play with me. What in the world is the point of even being in here to be treated like that. But they bought me starting equipment to help me level up faster and I feel bad since i don't have the thousands of gold to pay them back for that( Not like I forced them or asked them to buy that equipment for me).

I love WoW, it's fun and I like the lore as well as the gameplay. Only thing that irks me is the monthly subscription but I bet that's what almost everyone feels like. But I can't decide what to do, try and beg to get a refund on the game itself? From what I've seen, that's a rare or impossible dream. But I would love to continue playing but I feel bad for leaving and I have no idea how that would go, Any attempt in relationship reforming has and will be a failure. Not saying the rest of the people in the guild are bad.

fqosnr,SaltyBazzoo,Awakened Should Be A Permanent Affix,"2.5 IO Tank here. 

The flexability Awakened gives tanks in planning their routes around affixes and party combinations is amazing. 

Rogues are no longer a requirement for high keys so multiple party configurations are possible and other classes are seeing play. Feels great. 

Route planning / strategic skip options are so customizable and make (from a tanks perspective) planning routes each week much more fun than in previous seasons and leave room to tweak based on which classes you bring. 

Additionally, and from a pugging perspective, not having to rely on multiple shrouds, death skips / battle rez tricks to bypass certain packs, there is a lot more consistency in every key and less praying that one tiny thing doesn’t go wrong during one of these maneuvers and cost your party the key. Love this. 

Would be great to add the Awakened obelisk functionality as a permanent addition to M+ dungeons going forward.

Doesn’t need to be an affix — just add the 4 obelisks and mini-bosses as structures within the dungeons and allow players to utilize them however they see fit every season.

Waveblade Ankoan seemingly don't think your worthy of even 1 reputation point for killing elite Nagas in Nazjatar! This is clearly rigged to slow you down. The only reason for that is to get you to the next paying month because in terms of fantasy, emotional and logical reasons, there are none. The flow of reputation is rigged to be dictated by Blizzard and not by you:

In the past killing even non-elite mobs would give reputation. We also had tabards, representing a faction in a dungeon. 
Earning reputation with them two elements was actually interesting and felt faster. It also meant you can commit to a reputation as much as like you like, all day, if you wanted to focus on a particular reward or if you wanted to get a reputation out of the way for achievements like pathfinder.

As an example; Waveblade Ankoan should be giving me 50 reputation for killing elite Naga's because that makes sense at a fantasy level. Or wearing their tabard should give me some form of reputation in mythics and raids. Tabards are a sense of pride towards a faction, defeating the world's perils in the colours of that faction. That is respect. Game design should use these elements in their mechanics because it is fun and interesting. Blizzard now refuses to because they're to scared of you completing content and running off with your wallet. That is the case for some people but not all of them.

fqkaka,smita16,Thoughts on the rep grind as a filthy casual..,"Rant Incoming.....

I love WoW. I started playing WoW since vanilla. I have played off and on ever since, but I have played every expansion since. I was able to find a wife who also enjoys playing WoW. Normally we are filthy casuals.....averaging maybe 3-6 hrs a week to play. With my being on short-term and my wife working from home, we decided to take advantage of this 100% XP buff. We go our pallies her ret, and me prot from 90 to 118 in just under a week with pure questing.

We lamented how much slower everything is without flying and we decided we wanted to get flying in BFA after hitting 120, but we know it will be a grind. That is where my issues lie.

I will admit prior to playing with my wife I have never been a rep grinder or a raider because I never had the time, but we just finished drustvar. I think it is crazy that you do not start getting rep for that area until halfway through the main questline. 

I think that was an attempt by blizzard to artificially extend the time needed to get the rep in an attempt to keep us busy. Which is insane because there is so much in this game to do without these artificial extensions.

We used Azeroth Autopilot to stay hyperfocused on the right quests and after finishing drustvar we are not even halfway through honored. I think this is just another anti-player thing that Blizz has done. I saw that, but at the same time, I will admit I will never be able to stop playing wow completely. Maybe take a month off here or there but I love wow. I just wish the grind was not intentionally painful.

10____x
50x = 120
X = 24
 So by the rule of 3 ( don't know if that's the name in English ) we can find that we are going to level 24 non squished levels in 10. That reveals the purpose of the squish it's wrong by speeding up the leveling.
 The correct count should be:
60___120
10___x
X=5
That way we should upgrade 10 non squished levels in just 5, preserving 5 levels by expansion. Or we could do to level 7,25 to preserve even more level to the other expansions.

fqihla,Calonthiel,Best 1v1/dueling melee class?,"Since I work fulltime and now overtime in the health sector I don't have a lot of freetime to play alts or to play at all. Now that essences can be earned through echoes it is a little bit better but upgrading the cloak and doing weekly/daily quests is still a chore even on one toon.

I mained rogue from vanilla to tbc and then arms warrior in tbc/wotlk and then started playing again in Legion.

Generally I liked the warrior playstyle of charging in and chopping up people. I know that it has always been rather gear/healer dependent but at least in vanilla and tbc I could still 1v1 a lot of classes.

Since Legion I rarely win 1v1 fights against any class as arms warrior. Maybe I'm not that good but the total lack of self heal really hurts in any PvP situation where you don't have a healer near you.

I mainly do battlegrounds and a lot of the times there are healers around but it still feels incredibly bad to have no chance against ANY other class.

So my question would be do you guys/girls consider the best dueling class in various scenarios? 

1. 1v1 without pillars
2. 1v1 with pillars
3. 1v1 in the open world

fqi1ch,Drooper99,The strengths/weakness of Classic and Retail and hope for the future,"Stuck in quarantine and trying to find enjoyment in WoW but failing, I've come to some conclusions. Both Classic and current WoW have their strengths and intrinsic problems. I feel classic has a far superior progression system. The talents and gearing really feels rewarding and you feel you have control to build and tailor your character to your playstyle. Leveling to 60 and Gearing up through dungeons feels satisfying and the rpg elements are great too.

The problem is I do all these things to gear up my character for the ""hardest"" content and the raids simply  suck. As a DPS and Healer (I cant speak for tanks)They arent challenging, the rotations are boring and with 40 other people I feel I have no impact and could be replaced by any joe shmo in Orgrimmar. I show up and spam chain heal and lightning bolt and get my loot.

Retail on the other hand is different story. Leveling up is a nuisance that I circumvent with boosts, gearing is just a number on my character page. I could go on about the mistakes they've made with the azerite/corruption systems but that's beating a dead horse. Overall character progress is simply unsatisfying. But the raids and mythic+ are amazing and challenging. The problem is I dont feel like playing them more then once because I feel disconnected from my character and the gear and I'm disincentivized to participate in the annoying systems.

All I'm saying is I hope Shadowlands captures the best of both games but I fear that will never happen. Maybe TBC or Wrath had the perfect combination of both and I'll enjoy the classic versions of those games better. Either way those are my feelings and I'll get off the soapbox now.",1,1585393123,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fqi1ch/the_strengthsweakness_of_classic_and_retail_and/,wow,1

fqgmvs,Larseth,Alt catch-up suggestion: A fix to drowning in a sea of leftover quests,"Hi all,

Having just levelled an Alt to 120 using the new buff to exp i had the following thoughts. Would be great to hear any feedback.

**The perceived problem**

* With alt's reaching 120 faster and faster (especially with this temporary buff) it is very common to have levelled an alt to max level whilst having not completed the vast majority of zone quests. Once you are max level there is basically no incentive to go back and complete all of these quests if you have finished them on your main already. You could argue that they award reputation however the world quests and daily four provide plenty of reputation.

* For me this ends up leaving the world a clutter of incomplete story-lines and quests which certainly dissuades me from wanting to play a given character more regularly. I find myself as the title says, drowning in a sea of quests. 

* This problem is further compounded when you consider the lengthy quest-lines involved in the patch content and the play times that would be required to complete them.

**The ask**

* What i would love would be a way for alt's to be able to catch up their quest/story-line progress to that of a user's main character. Essentially auto completing all of the quests in a given zone/for a given faction/or for a story-line.

**The potential solution**

* Make available a single use Bind on Account item that, when used, advances the using character to the same point in a story-line/zone etc as the character that purchased the item.

* I would not expect to receive any currency for these auto-completed quests.

* Reputation could be awarded to bring you up to a specific standing, such as revered.

* Azerite power could be awarded to bring the alts necklace up to a given level. 

* This item should have Horde and Alliance versions which should not be cross compatible.

* This item should be expensive. As it is a once use item which affords a huge benefit to the real world user there is no reason why this should not be used as a gold sink, possibly costing a few hundred thousand gold per unit. It has to be expensive while still being accessible to average users as opposed to those players who focus their time on gold making.

* The item should only be able to be purchased by a 120 character 

* This could apply to the quests for the upgraded crafting points as these quests take a long time to complete.

**The outcome**

* Players would be much more incentive's to play alts, knowing that the massive question burden at max level could be removed.

* More 120's with more content available to them might result in faster queue times due to an increased number of characters needing to do the content.

* It would act as a gold sink which would remove more gold from the game overall that the super expensive mounts, as these are only affordable by a select few.

fqcpsd,Cinji,Returning to WoW,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

So I played WoW before and I didn't get far. Initially, I loved it. I was drawn into the world-building and the diversity of quests and how it had given me that feeling of joy and wonder as I stayed up late, sometimes past 4:00am just because I wanted to progress further. However, the more I played, the more I felt isolated. It felt difficult to speak with other players and play together as I was brand new and had never played WoW before and everyone was leagues ahead of me in content. Eventually, this feeling of isolation soured my experience and it felt like every time I moved into a new zone, it was just me and some NPCs. Tbh, it felt more like a single player game than an MMORPG except that one I played as alliance and got ganked by horde players every 5 mins :')

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I say this to say that I wanna come back to WoW and experience it all for real this time. But before that, I wanted to see if I could find a community that I could be a part of and play together with. I want to get into raiding and completing collections, but it's so much more fun when someone is with you and it doesn't feel like there's an absolutely mountain of things that you don't know and probably never will. If there are any takers, I welcome you with open arms and am extremely grateful. If anyone has felt the same, please let your voices be heard.

But honestly, why?

We honestly thought we'd killed them all.

But boy were we wrong.

But there was no to even add them in the game anymore, unless...

They are going to be treated as customization options for the blood elves.

But you might say, ""but they don't fir with the blood elf intro and lore"" and you my friend are right, but in Shadowlands there is a new intro quest zone.

And I honestly believe that the sanlayn just looking like DKs in BFA, was intentional to not spoil their actual look/ customization options.

""But wouldn't that make them a AR?""

Nope, if you look at the new troll customization options, you can play a sand troll, a bwonsamdi troll, etc. You no longer have to play just a Darkspear troll while playing a troll.

Apply this logic to san'layn. Yes you're still playing a blood elf, but you're a former blood elf now turned vampire basically.

And we already do have a example of this ig actually with night elves. Yes you can still play a night elf, but now, you can play a night elf night warrior.

fq8wfl,marek0039,How should Reputations be done in World of Warcraft?,"Yesterday, my friends and I were discussing how reputations should be done in wow. So I'm going to try to recreate our discussion on here and want everyone's thoughts on the matter.

**Mandatory vs. Optional**So we first discussed the difference between two styles of reps, mandatory and optional.Mandatory reputations are reps where to progress the power of your character you need to raise your rep.Examples- Nazjatar for benthic gear/essences, or Rajani for infinite augment rune/essences.

Optional reputations are reps where they don't progress your character's power but would give you cosmetic rewards.Examples- Netherwing for the drakes, or Order of the Cloud Serpent for cloud serpents.

We then discussed what is better for the game mandatory or optional reps

**Mandatory Pros-**Mandatory reputations are good because they keep people playing the game. When people play the game then there is a higher chance for more social interactions. It also helps players such as myself who are guild masters or raid leaders see which of their players are committed to progressing their character. If I see someone logging on every day to do their 30 minutes of dailies I know they are committed to progressing their character and becoming better overall.

**Mandatory Cons-**Mandatory reputations are not fun. We are playing a game to have fun, not to feel to be obligated to do stuff like dailies every single day.  It's not interesting do your 1,000th world quest for some azerite power. Just look at the legion and BFA reps. They aren't fun and interesting like they were back in the day.

**Optional Pros-**It allows reputations to run wild and free if they are optional. Blizzard can do whatever they want with a rep if they are optional because they won't be a core part of the gameplay loop. They can make reps enhance the feeling of a living world instead of just another gameplay system.

**Optional Cons-**Optional reps can lead to lower overall populations. We saw this in WOD where the reps were optional and so people could get away with raid logging. I understand WOD had its other problems that caused this but the reps did help in this way. This is very unhealthy for the game as a whole and should be strayed away from.  


**Examples**  
Here a couple examples of good and bad reps of each type  
Good Mandatory = Nightborne rep of Legion  
Bad Mandatory = Champions of Azeroth rep of BFA  
Good Optional = Netherwing of BC  
Bad Optional = Laughing Skull Orcs of WOD  


**Example Analysis**  
Looking at the examples we can see why they are good and bad. What made Nightborne so good is that it felt different from the rest of the reputations of Legion. A big problem with the recent reps of BFA and Legion is that they all feel the same. The only difference between each rep right now is what zone they are in like Voldunai in Vol'dun and Talanji's Expedition is in Nazmir but in terms of the reputation acquisition they are both exactly the same and that's the problem. The Nightborne rep represents how mandatory reps should be done, thematically different from the other reps and not relying on just world quests but having other means to acquire rep throughout the entire rep grind. Unlike the zone reps where you could get halfway to honored and then just world quests the rest of the time, there should be other means of getting rep besides just world quests all the way to exalted. I think another good example of this is the Rajani and Uldum Accord reps. Both of them have daily bonus objectives which are practically world quests except they don't appear on the map but all they do is just give rep. Rajani and Uldum Accord don't just rely on these bonus objectives to give rep but have other sources for rep. With this in mind we can see why the other reps are good/bad. Champions of Azeroth is bad because it feels just like every other rep in BFA and doesn't have a strong thematic besides just azerite. Netherwing is good because it has a very strong thematic and the reputation acquisition is different from the other reps. Laughing Skull Orcs is bad because it feels just like all of the other reps of WOD.  
To conclude what makes a good reputation is one that has a strong thematic that sets itself apart from the other reputations in the game, and second, that there are multiple ways to acquire rep besides just one system.  


**World Quests**  
Recently, I have been hearing a lot of hate going to world quests and I think the hate on them is unwarranted. Let's recall the reason behind the creation of world quests. Back in MOP, Blizzard went overload with daily quests and basically, everyone had to do 20 daily quests every day across all the reps. Daily quest overload. So when it came to WOD, Blizzard just said we are done with dailies and basically just got rid of them and put in place max level areas in each zone that you could just farm the rep by killing every mob in the zone. This was the two opposite sides of the spectrum of daily content and neither really worked so Blizzard came up with a solution which was the best of both worlds, world quests. As we know, world quests are daily quests that you just visit to complete the daily. This idea is a great solution to the two problems of MOP and WOD but what made players dislike them in both Legion and BFA was AP. Everyone dislikes world quests because everyone feels like they have to do them to progress their character. If they just gave reputation, I believe everyone would enjoy world quests much more. It would feel like you weren't obligated to do full clears every day for two weeks after you hit max level. You could do them when you felt like doing them. That is how I treated them this expansion and I enjoy them. I love seeing my rep bars say exalted and so for me I'm fine with doing full clears to get all my reps to exalted in the first two weeks, but the moment I hit exalted, I stopped. I didn't care about my neck level because I would get my AP from the sources I did enjoy like raiding and m+. Yes, I was evidently behind but I didn't care. This is why I think everyone gives world quests too much crap. If they just gave rep I think everyone would enjoy them more.  


**Which is Better, Mandatory or Optional Reps?**  
I think both can work, but they both need to do it in a right way. I personally think optional reps are easier and better to do, but mandatory can work. If all reputations became optional then the current systems would be close to working. I think world quests that would just give rep would work for optional reputations but the only change that Blizzard would need to make to world quests is just making sure that each rep had strong thematic world quests. Something similar to Kirin Tor world quests in Legion. Every time I pulled up to a Kirin Tor world quest, I knew it was one of their straight away. That is good. However, if Blizzard wants to keep reputations mandatory to progress your character, then they need to put in more time and effort in to them, similarly to nightborne. You would need other ways to acquire rep beyond just world quests and need to keep them interesting and different from the other reputations. Because of mandatory reps seemingly needing more work, that is why I think Blizzard should go back to optional so that they can focus on other aspects of the game beside reps.  


**Conclusion**  
Blizzard, if you read this, please give reputations special care. Depending on where you want them to fit in your systems, either as a system to progress the power of your character, or just a system to gain more cosmetics, please keep that in mind. You can't make reputations mandatory but put in the amount of effort you have been putting into them recently, you need to do more. You either put in more work into them or make them optional, but still if they are optional, put in effort so that they each feel interesting and unique.

fq8icx,NoUploadsEver,Now would be a good time to expand upon the legacy loot mode.,"With Legion Legacy loot coming march 31st I can help but wonder how much of an annoyance the Legion Artifact Weapon Relics will be.

There is also a few other minor annoyances, minor problems, and to be honest the potential for more, for Legacy Loot Mode to be a more interesting and fun feature.

So possible Quality of Life Changes:

1. Duplicate Protection (for 5 man instances, guarantee to drop no more than 2 of the same item per boss for raids.)

2. Opt out of ""Useless"" items such as Rings, Trinkets, Necks, and Legion Relics with maintaining the ability to opt back in if you real want them.

3. Total Loot Drop normalization. For cataclysm and later all raids drop a nice, reasonable amount of loot. 4-7 items per boss. It would be reasonable to up Raids like Molten Core which normally drops 2 items to per boss to 4 or 5. As 2 Items is fine for 5 man dungeons which are much shorter, but for long raids that is a bit of an annoyance. It feels particularly bad in original Karazhan which is so long and each boss has a fairly large item pool.

4. AQ40 improvements. Compared to any raid, AQ40 is far more annoying to collect transmog for because of the rep system, and the two items per boss system. Removing the rep requirements for the items would be a nice improvement, or just simplifying it to have the items just drop from the bosses would be very nice.

Possible Mode Features.

1. Use of Goblin Gliders

2. Bear Tartare as effective as it was in legion (which was so fun.)

3. +Speed on gear remains as effective %speed wise in legacy loot dungeons/raids as it did when originally aquired instead of having diminished power on leveled characters.

4. Re-enabled legion legendaries in legacy loot mode. Many of them had very interesting abilities, especially the ones related to movement or speed. One of the worst things about BFA to me was leveling to 116 and losing these effects when farming old content.

5. Standardized Loot Re-Roll Coins. Rather than having various currencies from MOP, WOD, LEGION, and BFA for rolling to get a chance at another item make them all the same, and make them work for all dungeons/raids. Could make it something easy to acquire to tie it in, like Trial of Style currency items (while retaining the old purchase methods, making the trial of style currency tokens into a proper currency, and making the trial of style available monthly.)

6. Boss Skip. Many Raids already have some for of system in place to skip to the last boss, or the last 2 bosses. Improving on this, adding it to older raids, and making the requirements lower for some current ones would be a tremendous improvement. Keep in mind that for wrath, cataclsym, and MOP raids raid lockouts can already be used to skip bosses.",9,1585351738,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fq8icx/now_would_be_a_good_time_to_expand_upon_the/,wow,1

fq7ph1,Wulfrinnan,The Mystery of Shattrath City,"The Warlords of Dreanor Shattrath City is one of the strangest places in the history of World of Warcraft. Many players may recall it as being a max level zone in Warlords that was swarming with demons. The home of an eternal war with the Sha'tari Defense faction with its dreanei and blood knights versus the Legion's summoned monsters. Others may recall rumors that it was planned as a raid and then abandoned as so much of WoD was. The strangest thing about it though is that there is a phase of the city that exists only for characters below level 100. It's a phase of the city that is strangely and startlingly alive. It seems to exist after an Iron Horde attack, but before the demons took over the city. It's well populated with friendly NPCs, including vendors and named characters we never  encounter elsewhere. There is a named commander giving a speech to his forces that then teleport away at the end. There are children playing tag in the streets. There is a battle cleric weeping over bodies saying ""I couldn't save them."" Oddly, there is a guard in the residential district blocking the way into a building full of corpses. If you go in, it triggers him warning you off, that the area is off limits.

  
This strange phase of Shattrath, one no quest sends you into, is more interactive and alive than most other places in Warcraft. Looming over the place is the central dome of Shattrath, which if you land on sends you flying away at speed with a warning that an unknown force repelled you. Later, the faction that is supposedly trying to retake the city after it is mysteriously lost to demons is notable for being one of the only faction grinds in Warcraft that has absolutely no quests attached to it. 

  
Why did Blizzard build, with great care and effort, a populated, interactive, and beautiful city that exists only in a single phase? What plans for this city and its rep grind were made and abandoned? What sat in the city's heart?  


Perhaps if Yrel's Army of Lightbound ever becomes a big bad in Warcraft we'll get some closure to this. Perhaps the forgotten raid on Shattrath will return, not against demons but against zealous paladins and whatever secrets they harbored those many years ago. Until then, the Shattrath City of WoD remains perhaps the least explained and yet heavily detailed place in all of Warcraft.

fq58hq,arshiaj,"Again, Cross Region Character Transfer","Ok so I know there are 2^87 other posts like this, but I seriously want some more attention on the topic. I have a 12 year old WoW account, which has all sorts of things I have collected over the years. After moving to U.S, I kept at it since region transfers were not possible, and I just worked it out with the 200 ms.
After quitting for a while, I came back due to the whole coronavirus situation.
Now, what I’m asking for, is the ability to transfer a Character to another region! I will buy a new account and everything needed for that “Character” to be transferred to.
This is insanely bothering to me, because apart from the essence grind, back grind, quest grind, “Path Finder”!, I will lose ALL of my mounts and everything, if I were to make a new account in US.
So in essence, Blizzard, you are either forcing me to quit, OR go to the dark web and try to find someone who would swap accounts with me! Is any of these two options what you would want?
Please don’t come and write that I should grind. I KNOW. I simply don’t want to GRIND AGAIN. I have done the grind, I have spent my hours. But now, with all the real world frustrations, I don’t want my gaming to be another source of stress and hopeless waiting.
Blizzard doesn’t care about anything anymore since we’re all more or less addicted to the game, so this is the last chance I would give blizzard to do something about it. It is not hard, transferring a character across regions, it is not a legal matter problem at all. Don’t waste my time and yours by writing about the problems of cross-region transfer. They are not problems, they are made up obstacles.
I will pay for a new account and the updates (or even shadowlands heroic version!), and I just want my character to be transferred there. It’s simple.

fq47nq,Rakoz,WoW 1080p 144hz - Laptop Heat,"I bought a Razer Blade 15 late 2019 Laptop with an i7 9750h and 1660 ti, the panel on it is 144hz. It didn't come with any software to show me temperatures and it's the first gaming laptop I've ever owned so came here for some advice. Because I find myself playing WoW for 10 hour sessions I'm worried I'm going to kill this laptop by choosing wrong settings  


I left WoW on preset 7, but turned MSAAx4 on, and the default FPS cap was 100. I left the power plan in win10 set to the default balanced, and Razer synapse power settings left on balanced also. (There's 2 other options 1 for GPU intensive use and 1 for CPU) - The fans exhaust is pretty loud almost immediately upon entering the game. If I lower the FPS cap to 60 it's a little quieter, and if I raise FPS cap to 144 to match the screens refresh rate the fans chug even louder, yet the game stays around 144 FPS  so it's not thermal throttling yet.  


What would be the best way to monitor the laptops temps during play so I can see how much extra heat  is generated going from 60 to 144 FPS? Of course 144 is smoother but if it's going to kill my expensive laptop in a months time I'd rather deal with the lower frame rate and maybe lower graphic settings from 7 to 5 - but then it's like ""why buy such an expensive laptop if you have to lower all these settings to keep it from overheating""

Is there any low level content for BfA? My idea was to start over and power through to 110 and then buy the expansion, grind the rep for an allied faction, and then use the character boost when the xpac drops but I dont want to miss any story or interesting content by not having it already, the only thing that's holding me back is the garrison, is it still useful at endgame? I don't really want to go through all that again two more times... also any recommendations for a new realm would be appreciated (if it even matters any more).

fpy1sd,Tyrsenus,Looking for something different to do? The Jenafur secret is still unsolved.,"For those who don't know, [Jenafur](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159783/jenafur) is a battle pet, the reward of a secret that was added in 8.2.5. Six months later, the secret remains unsolved. Smart and clever people are needed to help crack it!

Since [the last major post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ehlq95/friendly_reminder_we_still_didnt_find_jenafur/), the secret-finding community received two clues, but we are still stuck at the same step of the secret in Return in Karazhan.

**What steps of the Jenafur secret have been solved so far?**

* [Wowhead has a good introduction here.](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/jenafur-secret-cat-battle-pet) 

**Where are we stuck?**

If you look at the Wowhead guide above, we are still stuck at Return to Karazhan. RTK has three notable things that were added in 8.2.5 related to the secret:

* Two sets of ""kibble"" patterns on the opera house floor.
* Sebastian (the opera house organist) has a new dialog line: ""Music is truly the key to happiness.""
* New food and drink items scattered around RTK, which can be picked up and put down.

We haven't figured out what to do with these. It is unknown if all of these are related to the current stage of the puzzle.

**What are the two new clues the community received?**

* January 8: *Four Kibbles bounce in time, Four Kibbles count the time*
* March 23: *kibbles of 4, sets the time, of a 4/4 beat, and defines the lines*

**What else do we know for certain?**

* The secret is working as intended and is solvable (i.e. it's not broken).
* The secret is deaf- and color-blind friendly.
* Solving this secret does not require a group or completing a previous secret.

**How can I help find Jenafur? What has been tried so far?**

Join the WoW Secret Finding Discord! *[https://discord.gg/wowsecrets](https://discord.gg/wowsecrets)*

But pretty please read all the pinned posts first! In there, you will find links to documents with current theories, and a list of things that have already been tried.

**What's all this business about ""secrets?""**

* Blizzard has added numerous secrets, or puzzles to WoW which unlock items like the Hivemind mount, the Baa'l battle pet, etc. [Here for a list of past secrets](https://www.wowhead.com/secret-guides).

&amp;#x200B;

I got a question rlated to the new AH system. 

After a long break I saw the AH has changed drastically and I see lots of videos and thread saying undercutting isn't required anymore since there is the ""Last in - First Out"" thing.

&amp;#x200B;

But either I am totally misunderstanding that system or w/e I don't know...

&amp;#x200B;

When 10 ppl place an auction for 1g. I understand that the last person that put in his auction is going to be the first one to sell his item if anyone buys that item form the AH. (am I right up to this?)

&amp;#x200B;

But when I would decide (and basically that is what every TSM4 operation was doing) undercut by 1 copper my auction is listed for 99s 99c. So.. how can I be in that same ""line"" of auctions as the 1g ones?

If I search for an item on the AH, I always look for the cheapest price. So I would clearly buy the 99s 99c one. 

So why wouldn't it make sense anymore to undercut ?",3,1585316667,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fpx5zi/new_ah_question_returner/,wow,1

Recently, I decided to try the starter edition of the game considering the current COVID-19 situation, where I can't continue my studies and have had a lot of free time as a consequence, I'm currently a level 16 nightelf and I'd love to pay for a suscription, but currently my national currency is highly devaluated ergo I simply can't afford to pay it as I'm unemployed, if anyone there is willing to gift me some game time I'd be grateful from the heart, thanks for the time.",0,1585288975,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fprsl0/shameless_petition/,wow,1

fpo5yz,NeverDire,Reasons to bring back class sets,"World of warcraft is the game about you improving your character in different ways. By that I mean that people always try to get their character better in some way, for example people tried to get better gear back in first expansions but now it went more into visuals - Elite sets, raid sets, challenge sets etc. People like to flex lets be honest and the best way to flex in WoW is to make your character stand out in some way - mostly in visual. So after I told you all of this I can say that in BFA you cant really do it. You could get the new elite season set in OP class but you will wear it on nerfed class and they will look the same! You will not be able to stand out that much because you got this rating or you finished this raid EXACTLY on this class. 
Next reason is a simple rpg moment that if you want to make all classes equal there is no point of making so much classes, if I would not get an elite set back in Legion or bought a new accaunt I would look exactly the same Like Paladin or Warrior even though Im a DK - A totally different class with totally different style and look, but not anymore. Not all people want the previous sets, they dont look so good thats why people keep waiting or kept waiting for sets that they will like, they were always curious how their class will look in next raid or next patch or next expansion. 
And the last reason - the smallest one but very important one.
DH HAS 3 SETS! The class of dh has only 3 sets to choose to be a little bit different from rogues or druids and its a very small number.
As blizzard said: “ Hey you can always grind tmog from the old raids”, but here is the issue - dh has nothing to grind! Dh did not have any sets before and got only 3 sets which dont look that good to me and maybe to other people, and its not enough.
So please blizzard, instead of placing all your effort of making useless good looking warfronts or expeditions make a nice elite arena set, nice raid set, make some challenge appearences, make some stuff that will make people wanna get it to feel unique and cool!",1,1585272958,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fpo5yz/reasons_to_bring_back_class_sets/,wow,1

fpnu4u,shutupruairi,Flying Overhaul,"Arguably this is just as much a world overhaul as a flying overhaul but let's look at it primarily through flying.

Step 1 - make it so you can fly anywhere, you just do it badly there to begin with. Rather than not letting us fly at all in a region - make it so that you can fly in that region, you just suck at it. Pathfinder changes now from a gate barring you from flying to something that progressively helps you move better and safer.

Step 2 - flying durability. Make it so that all mobs have some ranged abilities and will attack you if you fly too close. Have durability tied to the Pathfinder so you become hardier in each zone. I'd also probably give druids a lower durability compared to regular flying to make up for the instant casting perk.

Step 3 - add a speed boost ability with X charges with Y cd. Make some of the charges and/or reduce the cd and attach that to Pathfinder. 

Step 4 - design the world with flying in mind again. Currently world architecture is confined by requiring someone be able to bypass it via a ground mount. 

Step 5 - design flying content. In TBC, we had races as part of the Dragonmaw chain. With flying durability and the limited, you'd be able to create more interesting scenarios. They even teased the possibility of this in BFA with Lasan talking about races in Zuldazar with the Pa'ku riders.",5,1585271678,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fpnu4u/flying_overhaul/,wow,1

fpkwsy,mihejlo,Let's make them hear us,"Sometimes we all participate in things that are half good, because of nostalgia, feelings that we had before, or some other reason that builds up our tolerance and we simply let things slide the way they are without saying anything.  Without a doubt, there has been many of us, saying things, speaking our minds, and giving comments whether they be blatant or constructive, but I don't think that they ever hear us. Because if they did, the game would never have gone to this stage in which it is now. I think there are people out there, such as MadSeasonsShow, that have been doing this in a more, everyday, passion like way, which many of us can't or don't want to do. Thats why I think we should all, if we care about this game and where it is heading, watch and share this video and be glad that we have sincere people in which we can put our voices and stand behind them to be the faces of the community. I don't want to go into detail why this video moved me, but as someone who has put thousands of hours into the game and practically grew up on it, the way MadSeasons talks about this game and with all the points being well put together and without a doubt true, with which I'm sure many if not all would agree. To shorten all this, he speaks from the heart. If more people stood behind content like this, maybe Blizzard would actually listen to the community to the point that we would all one day have a game that made us fall in love with MMORPG and World of Warcraft.

fpkibs,ItsPinkay,LF Friends,"So basically my best mate and I have been playing a variety of games together for like 9 years, but somehow we've not made any friends over all that time that actually play with us, like, ever. We both really want to do M+ but I hate pugging because I've only had one good experience with it in the last few years.  


We've gone through the effort of playing on multiple realms, joining multiple guilds in an attempt to have a good group to raid with and potentially do M+ with. But there's always just one or two groups in the guild that always run together so we're always left out and basically never talk to guild outside of raid, and even that, the raid groups haven't always been good.  


We play both Horde and Alliance, although my friend wants to find a new realm to play Alliance on (Potentially Frostmourne) as our current one is pretty bad. We're both Australian but have no issues playing with NA because honestly 200 ping is barely noticeable when you've dealt with it for so many years lol.  


I am currently 10/12H on my Ally Warrior and have done a bit of M+, but not much since Legion as I didn't really care for the dungeons in this expac. So I'm not a newb or anything, just really bad at making friends :P  


So in conclusion if you want to help end our loneliness and run some sh\*t, my Btag is Pinkay#1587 and my Discord is Pinkay#8656. Also sorry this is so long &lt;3

My research focuses on social and emotional experiences in video games – who we play with, who we talk to, and how we play while socializing. I’ve been playing *World of Warcraft* myself since just after *The Burning Crusade* launched.

I’m looking for current players of *World of Warcraft* to participate in a study about players’ experiences in Azeroth. This research study focuses on the emotional connections that *World of Warcraft* players develop within the world of Azeroth – connections to their personal experiences, to their fellow players, and to Azeroth itself. If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to fill out a survey that asks about your experiences in *World of Warcraft*, the specific *World of Warcraft* content you play, and basic demographic information. This research will help video game scholars better understand the emotional connections that players form with video game worlds; this knowledge can improve game design and user experience in the future!

I am looking for current players of *World of Warcraft Battle for Azeroth* AND current players of *World of Warcraft Classic* to participate in this study. You might be a player of just *Battle for Azeroth*, just *Classic*, or both! 

Participation is voluntary, and all of your responses and information will be kept confidential. You must be a current player of *World of Warcraft* (*Battle for Azeroth* AND/OR *Classic*) and 18 years of age or older to participate. If you’re interested in participating, have any questions, or want more information, please feel free to get in touch with me via email (jrobinson@kutztown.edu)

Now I sent a screenshot to my brother on discord yesterday at 11:45 AM, and I had 6 days left, right now after 1 day I have 4 days left.  


Is this happening because of the time at which I activated my subscription making it seem like it's draining faster than it should?

fpejk0,FirstSnowz,"Corruption could have been a really great system, with two super easy fixes","1. Allow corruption to be added on to gear, and ranked up / down via mementos. Maybe certain corruptions are unlocked with 1-5 masked runs, etc. It should be relatively cheap to do so that you can change gear as needed but expensive enough that it still feels good when you get a nice piece from your cache with the right corruption already. That would help out a lot with alts too.

2. Right now there is no internal cooldown on procs, and it has a low proc rate. This is why sometimes you get lucky and your damage spikes to insane amounts for no reason. The way they SHOULD have made it is to give corruption an internal cooldown, and a very high proc rate. 

Not only has this been their philosophy historically, but an example of this is the Gift of the Titans in Horrific Visions. If you run the weakaura, you know exactly when the internal CD is up, and you know within killing 1-2 mobs it is going to proc. This makes visions predictable, and I actually enjoyed progressing through the masked runs. If they had applied this same principle to corruptions like infinite stars (choosing which target you want to apply the stack to because you know when you're due for a proc) or twilight devastation (pulling packs in m+) or void ritual / rapid pulse / honed mind (saving CD's to align with the proc) then it would have actually been a really fun mechanic.

And that's literally it and corruption would actually be a decent system to give an honest try.",1,1585240230,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fpejk0/corruption_could_have_been_a_really_great_system/,wow,0

fpcq3g,Dash_OPepper,Animal Crossing did Island Expeditions Right,"For those who haven't played the new Animal Crossing: New Horizons game, it is an extreme casual game with lots of character and charm. The series has existed for a long time, being released in Japan in 2001 and just a bit later internationally. In the latest iteration they added a new feature called ""Mystery Island Tours"". You spend achievement points called ""Nook Miles"" on tickets that will take you to a random island. The island layout and items on the island are random, starting to sound familiar? 

In the original BlizzCon reveal for Island Expeditions they promised the following:

* Procedurally generated landscapes, monsters, and objectives
* Emphasis on exploration
* ""Dynamic Replayability""
* Variety of features including quest givers, capture points, and mini-exploration areas like caves and ships
* ""Unpredictability"", ""Strategic Decisions"" and ""Tactical Ability Use""
* 15-20 minutes per island

What the promotional material said and what the reality ended up being are quite different. Instead of exploration and a variety of activities to do, it boiled down to ""gather up monsters and aoe them down, &lt;5 minutes an island. Repeat until death."" So what features did Animal Crossing's Mystery Island Tours have?

* Different island types that change how you interact with them
* Random NPC visits
* Random crafting resources to gather that you can bring back with you
* Foreign fruit and flowers that you can bring back with you and plant at home
* Ultra-rare collectables have a higher chance of appearing
* No time limit

So what are the key differences that make one fun and one tedious? What did WoW do wrong that Animal Crossing did right?

&amp;#x200B;

* No Time Limit

If the emphasis is exploration, then having a time-sensitive objective ruins that purpose. If the ultimate goal is to collect Azerite, then exploration, not combat, should have been the means of collecting it. Why not get rid of 99% of the enemies and put the azerite in shipwrecks, caves, and with friendly npc villagers?

&amp;#x200B;

* Resources on the island can come home with you

Why was the only purpose of island expeditions azerite? If we indeed found unexplored islands in WoW, wouldn't we be interested in other resources? Skins, minerals, herbs, recipes, mounts, pets, etc. Instead they put random items in a ""gift bag"" once you collected your 12,000 azerite on the island. Oh wow, I somehow returned from this Island Expedition with 24 coins and a pet...

&amp;#x200B;

* Rare Collectables

Rare appearances, mounts, and pets are a good idea to include in an island expedition. Key words: INCLUDE IN. These items should have been found inside of the event, not given as random rewards after it's over. ""Hey what's that glittering object at the bottom of that shipwreck..."", ""Oh wow, I helped this island villager on a quest and they gave me bad-ass looking shoulders!"", ""OMG, that scary dragon I could have avoided dropped a mount!""

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, turning a potentially fun and unique feature into a grind for a currency no one wants was an extremely stupid move. Also, if you want an ultra-casual fun experience to escape from the doom and gloom that is WoW or real life right now, then you should totally pick up Animal Crossing: New Horizons.",32,1585234045,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fpcq3g/animal_crossing_did_island_expeditions_right/,wow,1

So, I have a quick question.  I have these two **new** tanks (ilevel 445+) and I am trying to decide which one to use for Heroic and dabbling in Mythic raiding.  I understand that it doesnt really matter, but here is my real question about them.

&amp;#x200B;

Monks are considered the ""progression"" tanks.  I understand that, but I feel like I do pretty crummy damage when I am tanking.  I probably dont have some needed / QOL essences, but if that is the case...I am fine with having to grind out essences if it fixes dps (especially for cloak runs)

Now, on my DH, I can pump out some pretty decent DPS as a tank but at a loss of feeling tanky.  So when playing a DH tank in Heroic raiding, am I pretty stuck doing the gluttony build only?  I have not gotten the mechagon essence yet but is that a requirement for tanking?

fpa8ke,albeva,Idea: Simple way to fix gearing in BFA,"Like many I find myself completely frustrated with how RNG and pure dumb LUCK dependant gear acquisition currently is. (I'm not talking about RNG on the gear itself - that is another can of fish entirely). Just getting it.

Mythic+ weekly chest can either reward you big time, or you get something entirely useless. In my experience it happens most of the time. Same goes for world bosses (most of the time just get gold), rewards from war fronts, doing weekly horrific visions, assaults, emissary quests, etc. All of it is RNG with no control on what you get or if at all.

For example this week so far on my main: mythic+ chest gave me a useless downgrade ring, assaults gave me non-corrupted downgrade item, 2nd assault didn't even give gear peace at all, horrific visions have also been disappointing to say the least and finally world boss awarded once again just gold. My gear rating currently is around 440 so clearly plenty of room to go.

While I think system is fundamentally broken and leaves people more disappointed I doubt any of it will be revamped at all.

So what I think Blizzard could implement is new currency and a vendor to allow people to work towards specific items. Trick here is that currency can be acquired from variety of sources and at a reasonable grind. I am aware there is Titan Residuum - a currency that is unobtainable by anyone, but most dedicated m+ players. Us regular folks? It's just equivalent of Blizzard giving us a middle finger.

So this new currency: trick is that anything that can drop gear will either award currency OR the gear item. If you don't like the gear item then you can go and vendor it for the given currency. And finally have a vendor that sells all the gear pieces up to certain ilvl for that currency.

Trick here is to make the effort reasonable. This way all activity will be rewarding. And if won't get the item player wants - they can still work towards it.

A little bit like benthic gear vendor was - except without the upgrade and RNG systems.",20,1585223694,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fpa8ke/idea_simple_way_to_fix_gearing_in_bfa/,wow,1

fp9uv9,Dowlphin,Trollslayer Rifle (another RNG story),"I was farming the Wolfslayer Rifle. Now I knew from experience that the Legion Karazahn opera event changes on a weekly basis; cycles even.
But I couldn't find conclusive info on how the BC Kara behaves, and inquiries remained without response. It's one of those things were you wonder why it isn't written somewhere as a PSA in bold letters.

So I went to Kara with my hunter and the event was Wizard of Oz. Then I went there with my rogue and it was the same again. So I deducted from that that it behaves the same way.
Next week I tried again but this time got Romeo&amp;Juliet. ... Because I had tiny doubts and wanted to make sure, I again went there with another char but again got Romeo&amp;Juliet.

This went on for two weeks, I think. I always got one of those two events, so now I also knew it doesn't cycle, which was very upsetting, that it would dodge the Wolf event so much.
Then this week I went there again with my hunter but got Romeo&amp;Juliet. Then I was so annoyed, I thought, let's make the best of the bad situation, so I decided to farm the fancy robe that can drop from that and went there with my warlock.

And suddenly the Wolf event was up!!! RNG had fooled me the whole time! The event is completely randomly chosen each instance generation!

And the frickin' rifle dropped on that first run!!! On my warlock!!!

Then I went there with five other gun-enabled chars and got the Wolf event two more times but the rifle didn't drop again.",3,1585221739,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fp9uv9/trollslayer_rifle_another_rng_story/,wow,1
fp9t8d,durrburger93,What was wrong with the normal/heroic raiding model?,"I legitimately can't see the faults with this model that went on in Wrath-Cata and even MoP to a degree. The LFR was added as a necessity for people who don't/can't raid to ""see the content"" and that's ok and a valid argument due to how much time and effort goes into the raids, but why do we now have this insane gulf between 4 raiding difficulties? 

LFR started as a tourist mode and that's exactly what it should've remained, with 0 incentives for anyone willing to do normal+ to ever step into it. Then people ignorant of what it was supposed to be, cried out how braindead it is. Now it's an obvious step in gearing, and it does require basic tactics knowledge in certain fights that the tourist crowd, which it was initially aimed at, can't get through without wipes.

So now we have a situation where, by the time I get to the heroic difficulty, I'm personally already sick and bored of the raid and the fights in the same environment where things require a higher level of play but the majority of the fight still plays out the same. Then there's mythic to strive for after that which is extremely difficult and demanding (compared to all other MMOs out there) but once again with the exact same fights. 

Earlier there were at least heroic only bosses like Sinestra and Ra-den, or fun versions of HC fights like the last Ragnoros phase to spice things up, now there's just a spreadsheet of tactics that keeps getting bigger with every difficulty. The previous raid tier was also usually relevant for every character, for example in Wotlk: RHC (ilvl 200) &gt; ICC dungeons (ilvl 219-232) &gt; TOC (232 - 258) &gt; ICC (251-277). Now the day a new raid drops the last one is dead, you literally can't do it aside from an occasional transmog run. This is a personal opinion of course and many don't mind repeating a single piece of content for months but I'm curious what others think.",13,1585221504,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fp9t8d/what_was_wrong_with_the_normalheroic_raiding_model/,wow,1

fp5nc8,Negationz,Highest HPS healer for M+,"Hello!

I'm approaching healing to combat the boredom after more than a decade of playing and I started healing mythic plus with pugs.


Now, we shall start saying that the best overall healers for m+ are Druid and Paladin. Their toolkit and damage is just too much.

Problem is that all the rankings out there assume that you play in a perfect cutting edge group where dps know how to kick and move out of shit, and tanks give you enough time to recover before pulling again, then swiftly fail to use their cd and die like a wet toilet paper strap.


What I'm looking for is an opinion about which class carries better a group of headless monkeys! (i know i know, find a guild etc etc... But the majority of guilds on my server are worst than pugs anyway)

From my experience I made these assumptions:
Druid: I really don't function well with dots, so I suspend any judgment on the class

Monk: having 2 strong cc helps a ton, sadly your mana burns away if two people start taking serious damage. Having problems topping the whole party since Revival is a joke

Priest: can only speak about disci. The worst the group is, the worst the spec performs. It's hard to use atonemeny when shit's falling from the sky. Again, hard to top up whole party since barrier is avoid like the plague

Shaman: in reverse, shaman manages to top moderately high party damage like a breeze (at a cost), but for the love of Thrall if a moron is on some deadly affix I cannot keep up with healing surge. Goes without saying that my lava burst is always at 2 stacks since people love dying. Ground targeted spells (healing rain and totem) are hard to use if you don't have means to communicate and coordinate

Paladin: it seemed the safest bet. Has tools to keep morons alive and does good damage. Probably is my fault, but i struggle a lot with huge party damage, even with a glimmer build. For now it's the only downside

fp54vr,GrapeDan,My costumer support experience.,"Quit wow some five or six months ago.. Came back to play with all this double xp going on and all that, So I reinstalled the game. However I kept randomly disconecting from the game frequently. I tried just about every solution I could find online and that the costumer support told me to do. At first they where being very supportive and helpful. Then when the first few tricks they had to solve it didn't work. Things took a rude turn. First of all I tried everything they told me...

Flush my dns, Restart my router. uninstal my addons, Delete my WTF and Cache folders. the only thing I couldn't do that they asked me to do. Was to run this stupid genious  WinMTR  test program.

This is to test any connection issues you might be having. However you have to restart it every ten minutes until a crash may or may not happen to get something to send to Blizzard. My crashes happend randomly and unpredictably... You cant tell when they happend they just do.

My problem here is that my computer is slow... It runs games just fine, Browses internett just fine. But for some reason. If I am in a game and try to tab out of it... It straight up dies, Just freezes forever and turns very laggy.

So I explain to them how unpractical and difficult it is with my pc to do this test, And ask if there is anything else we can try? Or if there is some other way to test my connection. I aslo tell them that, Everything else I play and try works just fine. And that world of warcraft also used to work just fine before I quit five months ago. And that I believed this was a issue with the game. And not my connection. This is the response I get.

 Hey there ''Name''  This is Technical Specialist \*.\*.  In order to look into this further, we need the data we requested in our previous contact. Could you run through the steps again and then collect the requested connection information and reply back with that attached to this ticket. That will allow us to look into this further for you. 

Like... He responds like he didn't even read what I had just said at all, Which I called him out for... And I repeated my self how difficult it was for me to tab out of the game to restart this test he wanted me to do every ten minutes. And he responds with basiclly saying that, If I can't tab out of the game.. My pc doesn't meet the minimum requirements to play world of warcraft, Like this tech dude suddenly knows my computers specs now all of a sudden just from that alone, He even adds at the end ''It barely meets the needs for classic'' Like am I talking to some elitist raid leader who became tech support here? For real? He then finishes by telling me to take my computer to someone for repairs, Because despite every other game working just fine on my pc. And World of warcraft have been problem free up until now... Apperently my computers inability to tab out of the game is apperently more the issue here than the crashes them self, So much so that he refuses to even aknowledge anything else I've said apperently.

I heard about how some trash-free raid that came out in Wrath, Trial of the Crusader, that ended up being perceived as horribly bland and boring, and never again had a ""long raid"" been trash-free since. 

Yet, that raises questions about how people perceive trash, in a raid context, back in WotLK. Did players, at the time of the trash-free raid's release, actually believe that trash was actually engaging somehow? Or people still believed that trash was a necessary evil back then? (And, if the answers changed between the release of that raid in question and now, please state so) Finally, was it run more often than other raids at the time because it was shorter? 

Also, was the trash-free raid ""horribly bland and boring"" because of boss mechanics being poorly executed? Was it because the story was poorly written? Was it because the loot was out of whack compared to the other raids of its time?

Can we get a system, where leavers are punished?  
I've even got a very good suggestion:  
If you leave 3 mythic+ runs in a week, you cannot go mythic+ on that week (or 2 weeks).

A mythic+ run only considered safe to leave if:

1. You clear it
2. Majority vote abandon it

If someone wants to leave it very much, but other don't, and he start trolling, he can be votekicked for griefing, which counts as a leave - or maybe only count as a leave, if a newly implemented system check determines that he is indeed trolling (requires development on lazy acti.. kghm, blizz side tho...) . I KNOW, this can be exploited, but I like to believe people are good willed, and won't kick someone, just because they can.

foxpiv,kubilayt,Harder to Get BFA Mounts in Next Expansions,"Most of the guides around -especially Wowhead- focus on the mounts -or achievements- that are going away with the end of BFA. I'd like to help people with a similar information, because almost none of the guides tell people about the mounts that will actually be really hard to get in next expansions.

I thought about this from another topic in this subreddit. I can't find it now, but I sent a comment briefly explaining them, now I'll go into detail. I do hope people will actually find this useful.

Briefly, my experience on this situation starts with Huolon. I have around 500 mounts, so I think I can consider myself as a mount farmer, even though I don't hard farm, for example, Pandaria world bosses. Instead I just wait for them to spawn on BMAH and hope to get a nice deal on them. Only one I have now is the Nalak mount which I got for 1m gold, which is a perfect deal for me as I had around 2m and having Nalak meant I'd never go to Isle of Thunder again because I already got all the mounts from Throne of Thunder. Huolon, which I farmed considerably a lot during MoP, is a pain in my ass for me, especially now. The only reason is it dies instantly when it spawns. As there's no protection around it, like Sha, you have to be on a group and be vigilant, which I can't do. 

So long story short, these mounts, in my opinion, will be really hard to get in Shadowlands and later on. Again, I do hope you'll find this useful.

**Rare Spawn Mounts**

Unfortunately, there are lots of them in BFA. First we started with 4 zone mounts;

[Captured Dune Scavenger](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163576/captured-dune-scavenger)

[Terrified Pack Mule](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163574/chewed-on-reins-of-the-terrified-pack-mule)

[Tamed Bloodfeaster](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163575/reins-of-a-tamed-bloodfeaster)

[Goldenmane's Reins](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163573/goldenmanes-reins)

These will be extremely hard to get in the later expansions, hence probably they'll be very expensive as well. If you have enough gold I'd strongly suggest you buy these. If you don't have enough gold but still want them, and feel lucky, farm them. Because it'll be almost impossible to find a group farming these. As of even now, they are really hard to get by farming. As I've seen around the AH across multiple servers they are quite cheap, so go buy them.

Also there are the other ones that were introduced with 8.2. Most of us familiar with these...

[Junkheap Drifter (Rustfeather)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168370/rusted-keys-to-the-junkheap-drifter)

[Rusty Mechanocrawler (Arachnoid Harvester)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168823/rusty-mechanocrawler)

[Silent Glider (Soundless)](https://www.wowhead.com/item=169163/silent-glider)

I consider myself lucky as I got Rustfeather one in like 10 tries, but the other two are nowhere to be found for me. The good thing is you can still find groups on custom groups for these guys, but I'm sure in the next expansions you won't be able to find any groups because they'll be getting one shotted as soon as they spawn. Harvester and Rustfeather have around 1 hour spawn time, while Soundless has more than that (I think it's around 3-4 hours). If you can get these before the end of BFA, it'll be perfect for you. Only good side is you can find groups for them if you are lucky.

The same thing goes for every rare spawn mounts which were introduced with 8.3 (the ones in Vale and Uldum). For completely the same reason I strongly suggest you to farm these before expansion finishes.

**PvP Related Mounts**

Not the Gladiator or Season mounts, they are too obvious. And they are going away (not the season mounts, I think you'll be able to get them with saddles by farming A LOT). But the ones in the open world will be very hard to get and noone ever mentions them.

[Conquerer's Scythemaw](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163577/conquerors-scythemaw)

This guy will be almost impossible to get as you have to get 1k honor in all of BFA maps. It's hard even now, and in the next expansion you won't find people around the maps, WM on just doing daily stuff. At least there are now Call to Arms quests. So don't forget to farm this one.

[Inkscale Deepseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=169203/inkscale-deepseeker)

Completely of the same reason, finish this guy off before the end of expansion. I'm still slacking on this guy, because I miss Battle of Nazjatar constantly, but if you want this, now is the time.

**Dungeon Mounts** 

Especially Freehold, Underrot and King's Rest mounts. You can farm them on Mythic on characters easily in the next expansion, I know but it'll be only once in a week. But now you can farm them on a strong tank character on M+ multiple times a day. I myself have a Prot Warr just for this reason I geared him up and a +2 in Freehold takes like 10-15 mins to complete. I used to do like 10 runs a day before I burned myself out. The idea is do them while you can do them infinite times in a day. After this expansion there won't be MANY people doing +2 Freeholds or Underrots.

(I haven't mentioned about Mechagon dungeons mounts as I haven't seen any proof that you can get the mount from 4th boss in the dungeons is obtained in a M+.)

**Island Expedition Mounts**

Well, at least they are way easier to get now. Noone has any idea how they can be obtained in the later expansions. Probably Islands will be like MoP scenarios, but it's still nice to get them now, as you can easily find a high geared group for mythic islands, if you have a high geared tank, one run takes like 5 mins. Having a high geared tank does a lot, so get one! 

**7th Legion / Honorbound Service Medal Mounts**

Just like Island Expedition mounts, we have no idea how to farm these Medals. Because the quickest way to get them is to do Warfronts now,  that's how got all of them at least (also 7th Legion paragon boxes give like 20 medals). Please get them now, if you really want them.

**Horrific Vision related mounts**

There 2 I can think right now. 

[Mail Muncher](https://www.wowhead.com/item=174653/mail-muncher)

[Wicked Swarmer](https://www.wowhead.com/item=174770/wicked-swarmer)

One you click the mailboxes inside the instance, the other you get with the related currency, which is quite hard to get in my opinion (at least it requires many many visions). You should give these a go before Shadowlands as well, if you don't want to come back to here after we are done with this place.

I know it's not like a guide, but more like an idea and a reminder. I myself always be regretful for not farming Huolon enough, or Talon's Vengeance faction in Legion. They are now really hard to get for me, I don't even know what I'm going to do with them.

Hope this helps to some of you.

fowf62,Scrufflelump,Looking for new friends.,"I made this thread on the WoW forums, but I figured I'd make it here too. Increase my chances and all that.

 Hey guys. :)

I made a thread like this back in MoP, but it was poorly received and I was harassed into deleting it. I’m just looking for some cool people to play with. Simple as that. If you’re also looking to extend your social circle, you can leave your Btag here and maybe you can get some adds too!

Just a quick rundown of what I’m into…I have 12 Horde and 12 Alliance, but I mostly play Alliance. I love tanking on this guy, but I’m not a big fan of mythic + or raids. Honestly, I love helping out low level players! Scaling down with party synch to tank for them, helping them quest, (I have the 2 seater flight form) giving them free enchants, buying them bags, helping them pay for heirlooms, running them through raids for titles and transmogs, etc. I’ve even thought about helping new 120’s run horrific visions or helping them with assaults. Just anything to make someone elses experience more carefree. :)

My guild mostly runs high level keys and heroic Nyalotha and I’m just not into that. I joined them when they were a leveling guild, but now they’re all maxed and running keys/raids. They are still a fun group of guys to talk to, but I don’t have many people to help out or play with, the way I like to play.

Anyway, if you’re interested in adding me, just to chat, or you need help leveling, or you want to run regs/heroics, or do some transmog runs or anything fun, feel free to add me! My Btag is Scrufflelump#1465

Also, I have a healer too, if you’re a tank. :D

fovlle,Jasreha,Sylvanas and the Forsaken,"Okay, this is something that’s been bugging me since the beginning of this expansion. Why is it that everyone seems *so stunned*, so horrified, and pulls the “ruining the character” card when faced with what Sylvanas did throughout BFA? 

I’ve played since Vanilla, and never once in this expansion was I at a loss for why Sylvanas, as a character, did the things she did. She’s always been open about the Horde being a means to an end. She’s always been honest about her viewpoint that in the end, everyone is going to die, and if she had her way, they’d all be Forsaken. She literally tells Garrosh that the difference between herself and the Lich King is that she serves the Horde.

Is anyone actually surprised that, while she was leading the Horde, she ultimately worked toward her own, *already established* ideals?

The Forsaken tooltip in Classic flat out said/says that they use the Horde as a tool for their own ends.

How, exactly, is it that everyone wants to scream that Blizzard ruined her character when she acted in a way completely in line with what she’s been saying and doing since Vanilla?

fovg2n,Drakhya,New PvP Resto Sham player - questions about playing against some classes,"Hello everyone, as the title says, I am new to PvP, I play as Resto Shaman and have trouble playing against some  classes. I play in 2v2 with my boyfriend, which plays as a dps DH and is also new to PvP (and not really into it...)  
\- First are classes that got huge mobility, I usually try to run and drop my totems to root/slow them but they still run faster than me (like monk and druid which are those I struggle the most), even if they're melee, I can't kite them.  
\-  2nd are... Healers. Yeah it can sound dumb but, for example I struggle playing against a Resto Druid, which I know I can Purge his healing buffs but he doesn't care since he can use it again.

\- And finaly, classes that got a lot of CC. I used to play with Relentless and changed for the Gladiator, but sometimes if I am playing against 2 classes that have a lot of CC, I'll get stun/fear etc again after I use my medallion, which sometimes makes my mate die because I couldn't play enough to heal him.

In short, I have the most trouble against Resto/Feral Druid and Wind Walker Monk

But now with the quarantine I find myself have a lot of time to kill, and this game has always been in the back of my mind since I used to make lvl 20s back when I was a kid during BC and couldn't afford the subscription. It was fun back then, and I'm looking to reignite some of that now.

I also played Classic for about a month or two when that came out, getting my mage to lvl 60 and a few alts into their 30's - 40's. 

I'll probably be playing with my girlfriend, and she's in a similar boat as me regarding experience with the game, maybe a little less.

Would it be a good idea to play Horde on a realm like Thrall? Which classes should we look at to make leveling a fun experience as a duo? She's likely going to go hunter or mage, so what would pair well with that? I was thinking paladin.

And, should I go with the Complete edition that includes the shadowlands preorder or just buy BFA?

fosfq4,Vestiel,The situation of the Alliance,"Hey guys, I would like to talk to you today about few things that are heavy on my heart. I am an Alliance player. I've always been Alliance player. I had played Horde, because my realm is generally Horde-dominated, but it still has (or had) quite strong Alliance side. 

We all can see already that Alliance is growing weaker and weaker on competitive side. Alliance Hall of Fame is closed couple weeks after Horde's HoF. Now, some of you might know, but only this week some Alliance guilds decided to move to Horde. And I am not talking top1000 guilds. I am talking top100-150 guilds in World Ranks. 

But why is it really? Many years ago Method switched sides due to ""better"" racials Horde had. The difference now is like 1%. It's insignificant for most of us but it's still there and top-tier raiding guilds will always chose better racials. But I don't think this is the only reason. And thus I created this thread. 

Here are my personal takes on the situation:

**1. Weak race designs.** 

Alliance has terrible races. Right now Night Elves are the best due to Shadowmeld, but from a casual-player perspective, Alliance is not interesting at all. I get it, Alliance is this 'civilized' and 'noble' part of the game. I really do, but there is nothing... feral, nothing unsual about Alliance. It's all the same and boring. The most wild thing in Alliance are Worgens. Kul'Tirans should be savage pirates, but they are just... thick humans. On the other side we have Orcs that Thrall have made so iconic. We have amazing Undead, part of the plague that turned against Lich King. We have Zandalari Trolls with great story and interesting characters and Loa. The Horde has great characters and heroes with interesting backstory. Alliance has none of that. We have terrible Anduin. We have wasted potential on Tyrande and Malfurion. We have quite interesting Genn, but he was also set aside. 

If I was new player, I'd probably go with Horde, because they seem far more interesting.

**2. Storytelling.** 

That problem has started many years ago. The Horde was favorited for years. I am not saying Blizzard did this intentionally, but anyone who is interested more in lore will see that first expansions it was always Horde. They always had more. Better races, better racials, better heroes, Green Jesus and so on. The BfA story says Alliance has won the war. But I still think there is so much wasted in BfA. The entire ""war story"" was terrible and many Influencers like Nobbel or Bellular have already said that Blizzard made a whole lot of plot-holes and weird things. But, ask yourselves, what was the most remember-able part of the story? To me, Alliance player, it was Saurfang and it was the story of the undead Tidesage. And the end where Saurfang has died, killed by Sylvanas. 

**3. Competitive scene.** 

Now that's the last problem I consider a major one. It also has started many years ago, but Blizzard hadn't done anything with it for far too long. Like I have mentioned above, they changed racials so that the difference between is minor, almost non-existent. But because many years ago this was a huge deal, tons of pro guilds moved to Horde. And they don't really have any reasons to go back to Alliance. Well, now we can see some of top M+ players playing on alts in Alliance due to Shadowmeld, but this is still a tiny part. Getting good players on Alliance is becoming harder and harder. And this is why more top-tier hardcore and semi-hardcore guilds are changing to Horde. And Blizzard should do something to change it. 

**4. Conclusion**

So what can Blizzard do? We all know that they have started doing something by giving Alliance two Allied Races that require a reputation gained by both factions - Lightforged Draenai and Mechagnomes. But that's not enough. I think Blizzard should start by giving people a possibility to transfer to Alliance for free. For guilds and for regular players. At this moment I think only Silvermoon and Ravencrest are the real last big servers for Alliance. But sooner or later guild will leave them too, because it won't be possible to find good players anymore. And what will be left on Alliance will be weaker semi-hardcorde guilds and casuals :(

Big time! 

So i'm was a Marksmanship hunter but then i swapped to Beast Mastery now my problem is that i not can found any kind of ways how should i setup my abilities in the ability bars and what talents would be good for this in 8.3 since everyone have different oppinion and different setup ways. 

Some people says this in videos and some does others in websites and there not have any freaking way to actually know what is the best for any players and it's so frustrating and annoying because if as i said i mess up my setup then everyone might blame me that why i not watched this video setup or that website to setup my character. 

Blizzard should maybe teach players who not as talented in it as those who play this game since the really beginning.

I started playing first when i had the Battle Chest then i had the Pandaria, WoD, and now BFA.

 The issue i have is there so many mechanics in the game it's hard to track of what is important to make your character actually be good in endgame. 

I wish Blizz create they own tutorials to those who not know anything about the game or barely can understand the mechanics as i do. 

So i ask anyone who might can help with my beast master setup like abilities, rotations, what pet should i use etc. i would be really greatful. 

The other issue i have is that i'm totally play this game solo so far and always suck at stuffs, like i not know what to do for able to fly in Legion and BFA or how to unlock normally the Alliances Races, ok i have the Highmounten Tauren but i don't know where should i start the rest to have all remain races.

&amp;#x200B;

So please if someone can give me a really helpful guidance in this game i would be really happy since the frustration and anger cuz of lack of knowladge it unbearable.",8,1585146265,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/for53i/help_me/,wow,1

I would like to level up characters of various levels 85,92, 102,113. 

I have an lvl 120 priest dps.

I quit ""hardcore"" WoW with pandaria, but i played 2-3 month BFA one year ago then quitted again. So the main problem is that i don't have flying mount in Draenor or Legion.

I think once I get to 110 I'll have no problems, in fact I'll just follow the chain quest of the last expansion.

How can I level off from 85? In fact I'll be able to get to 90-91 in Mount Hyjal but then what should I do in my situation? Is it better to take the flying mount in legion and draenor?If the answer is yes should i take it with the pg at level 120 or while I'm leveling a new one?  How long does that take roughly?

I read this excellent guide and took inspiration for my questions, I hope your answers can help new players as well.

I try to save celestial Alignment for boss fights but usually end up using it on cooldown or right before a trash pull.  Am I doing something wrong??

If there is any helpful advice you have, I would appreciate it.  

My stat break down is this:

Crit= 37%

Haste = 26%

Mastery = 32%

Versatility = 6%

To help manage my DoT's, empowerments, and celestial alignments I use a weak aura.  I have 3 streaking stars and arcanic pulsar azerites.

foklud,Psychatix,"Blizzard, just gut LFR N'Zoth already, or increase Determination stacks to SANS levels.","It's kinda ridiculous, but it's how the community is. If you have too, give a slight nerf to the LFR trinkets, since LFR versions of the trinkets are almost better than EVERYTHING else in this expansion anyway barring Ashvane trinkets and higher difficulties for a lot of classes. 

LFR groups cannot seem to just coordinate well enough on LFR N'zoth to down him i na reasonable amount of time. I've been in 10 stack groups for two hours every single time I have done this LFR since it's been out. 

Other players in every group have said the same, hours of this one boss because it's too hard to coordinate a group of randoms, which is what N'Zoth requires. 

When they released LFR they said it was basically a ""story"" mode, for players who just want to see the story of the raid without having to actually commit too hard or try. Yet the past couple LFR raids this expansion, boss fights were left with a lot of their mechanics in place, just reduced numbers, and LFR groups are simply not able to down these bosses in a reasonable amount of time. 

Yes, of course people are like ""I just got into a group tha tkilled it in one shot"". LFR is for the undergeared players that barely have any corruption resistance, and so little dps and none of their good corruptions or trinkets that LITERALLY SKYROCKET their dps, like Razor Coral, Psych Shredder, Mind flay, etc. the majority of LFR is undergeared in several systems..i.e. corruptions, weapons, trinkets,  and essences. Having the right Essences makes a big difference to dps, having the right corruptions make a huge difference, having the right trinkets makes a huge difference, and then weapons last. 

Is the fight hard? No, not really, but for some reason coordination is too hard for LFR groups, or the fight itself is too chaotic for a ""story mode"" version. I personally say nerf Psychus health, or remove the Sanity mechanic altogether.",153,1585112806,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/foklud/blizzard_just_gut_lfr_nzoth_already_or_increase/,wow,1
foki44,pkvgame9999,Pkv Game is a source of community income,"Many still wonder about how Pkv Games can make money for us. In this case, if only the theories of all online game observers, then it cannot directly examine how pkv games are a source of income. It would be better if we know the process of revolving funds in pkv games when we play directly.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Pkv Game**](https://pkvgame99.com/) is an online card game server. Where there are 9 games that are in the Pkv Game server. Game provider agents are also commonly found on the internet. All agents only provide a table game, where each member who wins will be deducted from the rental fee for the table game. As an agent providing service and service must always be maintained. This is so that the players at the agency can be comfortable playing with ease.

&amp;#x200B;

To start joining the agents providing table games, of course the players will register first. If you have registered then the players must deposit funds to be able to play with other players at the game table. To deposit the funds themselves at each different agent. The difference does not mean anything, because every provider also uses the same server. Only different in economic reach.

&amp;#x200B;

Pkv games are often said that the game server is a source of income for its players. That is because in the game provided it is very easy to play and very easy to get the jackpot too. For that, not a few who agree that Pkv Games can increase people's economic income. Why not, because only with small capital, you can win a lot every day. There are no special tricks in the game provided. But it should also be known that the essence of victory is patience. So the advice for the players must be more patient in playing.",1,1585112294,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/foki44/pkv_game_is_a_source_of_community_income/,wow,1

You get these assholes once in a while, but this week was a bit too much for me (5 times!!! 5 bloody times.)

fojepg,Astronomy_,More effort and care should be put into the next Collector's Edition box set,"The art books and mouse pads were probably my favorite parts of getting a Collector's Edition and they were included in every set except BfA's. It's a shame they didn't add these with the BfA Collector's Edition and I hope they're included in the Shadowlands one. I really enjoyed looking at the concept art and stuff for the game. There was also no physical soundtrack. The digital soundtrack key was nice because you could download in different formats right to your PC, but on the other hand it's also nice to have it physically for the novelty I guess. 

A few things I did like though were the nice medallion and the mounts, although I ended up not using them as much because they weren't flying. Overall, the box just felt kind of empty, underwhelming, and a downgrade compared to previous boxes.

Something I must mention though is that they did release the 15th Anniversary box with the really sweet Rag statue and a few other goodies (including a mouse pad) but this was pretty hard to come by if you couldn't get the money straight away to buy it before it sold out insanely quick. Maybe the 15th Anniversary is why they didn't fully go into the BfA Collector's Edition so hopefully Shadowlands will have the art book and more like the other past Collector's Editions.

TLDR; The BfA Collector's Edition box set felt underwhelming in comparison to all the other Collector's Editions, but BfA's lack may be because they released the 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition later (though this felt a bit harder to acquire). Shadowlands should follow in the other Collector's Editions footsteps and include more things like an art book, a mouse pad, and maybe a couple other unique items (like a pin, art prints, a notepad, or things like that).",8,1585107226,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fojepg/more_effort_and_care_should_be_put_into_the_next/,wow,1

That is what people want yeah? We don't care if the content is going to be the same, or the numbers, we just want it to match what we use to have.....

Nobody said this. Yet that is what it seems like we are running into with the next expansion.  What MOST people that I have heard from has said, is their major problem is the power creep. With the roll of the dice, you could be GOD Like, but most of the time you are an Average Joe. We have no control over our character's power. It is all rolled into random procs and gear score. Skill really doesn't come into it. 

I personally don't care about my character's level. You can normalize all stats that isn't going to draw me into the game. I use to like the stat variety and gemming/enchatning my gear to reach certain Thresholds that benefited my spec/gear. I like interacting with new powers and new situations.  I don't like slot machines determining my output. I mean think about this, you learn all the nuances of a fight. Each ability the boss will do, the positioning that is required, your tactics are completely sound. However, all the DPS's slot machines suck and you don't put out as much damage, the Priest's slot machine tanked completely. No one is getting healed, the DPS isn't doing much damage, and whats worse, the DPS who did the most damage, has pulled Aggro off the tnak because their slot machine rolling 3 middle fingers.

Level reduction and stat squishing doesn't fix our problems. It is the random element that does.",5,1585097970,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/foh5xx/squishing_for_you_and_me/,wow,1

foezk4,venzenden,Adventures in Cakiness," 

**Disclaimer:** *this was written up before social distancing and self quarantine measures were put in place.* 

Over the years I have played games in many capacities. I have played board games, tabletop miniature games, video games, and a variety of more abstract activities that could be considered games. Video games have almost always been a part of my life. They have been around to entertain, educate, and sometimes motivate. One game in particular has been a constant companion, a sort of cornerstone in my life. That game is the World of Warcraft.

Over the years World of Warcraft has absorbed a good amount of my free time. And while many people consider video games to be frivolous, and bad for our health on numerous levels, I have found that it is important to consider the cost/benefit analysis on an individual basis.

Have I crossed the line between healthy gaming and something more damaging. Absolutely. Have I ever eaten too much cake, yep. Yet here we are, living in a world where I can literally walk 5 minutes at any time of the day, and be assured to find a little hunk o' cake in a plastic wrapper to fill my face hole. Strangely no one seems to be crying out against the dangers of cake. Well, except that one guy. How did it go? Something, something, ""the cake is a lie.""

Mmmm, cake.

/sigh

I have been guilty of eating too much cake. I have done it many times, and if I had my way, I would probably continue to do it at every possible opportunity. Would I advise others to eat cake three times a day? No, no I would not. What happens is that we get older, and we get wiser. We start to see that maybe self-discipline might serve us better. Sure I want cake for breakfast, but I know that I will feel a whole lot better if I have some green juice instead.

I know all this, but cake has upsides too. It makes me happy. It is delicious, it's fun to share with others, to talk about, and sometimes even to bake. It's a cultural phenomenon, much like the beloved World of Warcraft.

**Lessons of Warcraft.**

I have a pretty standard set of times that I set aside to play. I do not have parental controls enabled, but I try to be consistent. Normally I log in and out within about 30 minutes of my set times. It is a good system, it's stable.

This last week has been very strange. I keep getting disconnected. It has not been stable.

What can I take from this inconvenience? Well, I guess that the best takeaway is that sometimes you get what you need, and not what you want? Things happen, life is funny like that. For example, I have not actually eaten real cake in years. Do I miss it? Yes. What has the end result been? Well, overall I seem to be a much healthier and happier person without it.

When I think about it, I guess it could be a win-win. The cake does not need me. It's completely good just being cake. If it's one of those 24 hour convenience store cakes, it might have a 200-year shelf life. On the other hand I really like cake, and I sure miss it. I feel like the world would be a better, happier place if I just ate cake. I mean, I would certainly be a happier person... right???

What does this have to do with World of Warcraft? I can't remember. I'm just sitting here lamenting the fact that I have no cake. With all this unexpected time to contemplate I find myself asking: Is the cake a lie?

**Update:**

Since writing this I have discovered an artisan bakery that makes a very passable cake that does not transgress my dietary restrictions. I know this because I took the opportunity to sample one such delight. 

I finished the said cake and was taking a few moments just savor the warm glow which had infused my being. And as it does, my mind wandered down the avenues of implication and outcome. What had been traded for this indulgence. I looked again out the window, feeling something slipping away, at first a small tug on my consciousness, but growing more urgent as moments passed.

Then the question was there. Can I have my cake and eat it too?

Now troubled, I left the bakery not feeling the warm infusion of cakiness, but a sudden urgency. What was the true essence of cake, and had I just made a terrible mistake? I hurried on, the questions would have to wait. It was raid night, and It simply would not do to be late.",0,1585090077,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/foezk4/adventures_in_cakiness/,wow,1

fodzs9,Malahava,Let us quest in the other faction's zones,"With the 100% XP buff on live right now, a lot of players are leveling alts before shadowlands comes out. I'm on my third character personally that is hitting the 110 to 120 bracket, and I'm just so sick of doing Voldun, Nazmir, and Zuldazar. 

My idea is for blizzard to allow us to do the opposing factions storyline in their three zones as well, thus doubling the available questing content for a room in BFA. It could work similar to how we would change factions in Siege of Dazaralor, where a faction spy could give us an explanation of what the other faction had been up to, and then we would experience it by playing through the content.

It might not be as easy as the raid was to implement, but with the next expansion being a long ways off and no content until then, it could go a long way towards player quality of life.

And could pandas not be added as just a skin for furbolg race? I mean the asian architecture and all that stuff is kinda represented by night elves or just elves in general. 

2. Garrosh, that was just horrible story writing, Garrosh told Thrall he's not good choice for warchief and yet still that motherfucker would smash his head with Doomhammer without mercy. When Garrosh just did what he considered best for the horde.

And a big faction war should have been saved for very last expansion. 

3. The whole time traveling bullshit I mean yeah old Draenor and all the clans and iconic orc characters are cool but why the hell confuse people with alternate universes.

Not sure what happened but, here it is again.

Sorry that I didn't get to answer to all the comments on the previous post. Thank you all for the kind words. Here are the answers to some questions that came up on the previous post.

I sketched this for Halloween 2018, hence the severed head over there. Good thing about this Quarantine is that I got to finishing up old wips. 

This was re-painted in about 2 days (one for the line-art, one for the colouring+ i already had the sketch as a base). Half-body's are relatively ""easy"" to draw for me so I do them rather fast.

I'm marking it as NSFW, since even if this is not ""gore"" imo, what my boy over here is holding is effectively a severed head.

This is an RP/story situation. My guy over there has a thing for shrinking heads, but is going to try and raise this guy. This will turn out to not be the best decision and the Draenei will become his annoying, flying, ""hey-look-listen""-like companion.",2,1585062547,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fo6ndu/this_got_sadly_removed_for_improper_sourcing_but/,wow,1

So after initially struggling with what I'm supposed to be doing in wow at all, I found the lore master achievement for completing all the quests in an area. This finally gave me direction in the game and I started making my way through different quest lines in different areas. However, I've now hit level 60 after only completing 4 areas of eastern kingdoms and according to my group I'm over levelled for this and need to move onto the expansions. Problem is I am kind of a completionist at heart and want to finish what I've started here first. They suggested just making a new character but it seems kinda lame to make a new character every week just to keep playing the game the way I want. 
Is it pretty normal to play the base game and the expansions out of sequence? Will I not understand certain story elements?

Am I missing something? Or is this something g everyone wonders at some point?

fo2ey2,Jake7even,Corruption and Essences,"Hey I am just asking myself right now what the purpouse of some of the essences and corruption items/effects is. I am not talking about the effects themselves but rather how you unlock them. Ok reputation farm was a thing to get allied races and mounts etc but gear? Why? Also bad examples for essences: pvp players get forced to play pve for essences, corruption traits and gear and pve players get forced into pvp for essences...Why? 

There is simply no good reason for changing a system in a way that you get forced into a whole part of the game for an extended period of time that you do not enjoy. If the essences that you get from PvP weren't so good in PvE as they are right now it'd be no issue, but basically most of the classes need at least 1/2 essences from pvp...
Also companion xp for another essence, reputation for yet another essence...

And the corruption traits are also pretty much ridiculous. E.g. for me as a Rogue main the Ra-den weapons that have the tentacle corruption trait basically make up wether you can play m+10 or m+15 that's simply a huge FeelsBad moment since it's like with legions legendaries only that at this point legion already had the system for buying legendaries.

RN we have BiS for corruption pieces, azerite traits, essences and obviously stats. That's so many points of RNG that it is basically impossible for people that just came back after leaving on raid tier 1(like me) or more or less casual players to ever reach at least decent gear. I am not talking about BiS everything on 470+ ilvl, simply about some decent azerite traits(currency to buy azerite pieces is a pain to get, since I rarely ever drop azerite pieces at all in dungeons), essences(weeks of daily content to get many rank 3 essences +pve getting forced to.pvp vice versa) and corruption pieces(need to raid and/or do high tier horiffic visions which is hard to achieve without playing for a long time giving you more abilities in the horiffic skills).

Overall what I am trying to say is that the catch-up mechanics the game offer are ok to the point of playing the content on lower difficulties and for people with a high-end character to twink, however for people like me who are coming back after leaving earlier in BfA trying to get to the point of running more than m+10 and running hc or m raid of the last 2-3 tiers really is a pain to achieve. If I would be able to achieve it by playing a lot I'd welcome it in these times of quarantine however it is locked behind rep, daily content played for weeks over weeks and pvp which are all things I either would never play if not forced to do so or locked behind daily content. This way I am basically forced to play the game from now all the way to shadowlands to play content that's already not the most recent anymore...

To sum up my complaints and offer a possible solution:(tl;dr)

I feel like blizz should change parts of the design to make it more raw time/grind based to unlock essences and co rather than real time based(daily Content). 
The way to do this would be to offer a lot of non-daily content to farm reputation, companion xp, currency to buy azerite pieces and currency to upgrade horiffic abilities. This way if I simply play 6+hours a day I will catchup fairly quickly and playing ~2h daily (which is roughly the time it takes me to clear all daily content) will still be roughly as fast to gear up as it is right now.",5,1585043167,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fo2ey2/corruption_and_essences/,wow,1

I’d like to get back into WoW, and play very casually like maybe twice a week. However, I see a lot of people on here mentioning how BFA is so bad and it’s a constant grind.

Do you think if you were a casual player mainly for PvE and dungeons and raids, that you’d prefer playing this game?

Do you guys feel BFA is bad just in general? Or if it’s because the game doesn’t have much content for serious and/or casual players?

we have all had bad rng where we were literally running around for 30 seconds not doing anything to avoid the ghost. that is not fun but it is justified by the added dps? i dont think so. i have literally died to non elite mobs because i have had super bad rng in the open world. 

This is not to mention having multiple piece of armor to lower or increase corruption depending on the fight as required. this management of amour is fine for most people, but it is a bitch if u have  all 3 roles and u have just a bag full of gear.

it sounds like a rant and it prob is but i distinctly dislike corruption and i would rather go bak to titan forging.

&amp;#x200B;

I have done the whole raiding every week to get new gear, being top dps etc...

I got to max and kind of got tired now, I'm working, have other things and hobbies I do, but I still made time for the game in that I enjoyed the little things more:

I restarted from scratch, not even a twink character, but decided to read through each quest to get the story. I complete the story and quests of each area, really enjoying the scenery and taking screenshots as though I am keeping a record of memories. I level still pretty quick and areas have become piss easy as I am higher level than the area I am at currently, but it doesn't bother me. Now it has become easier to even solo the dungeons to the corresponding areas so I even get the full story of each area too.

If I need help, I will ask in group or communities, there are a few people leveling in the areas I'm in now who are happy to help (for example, some quests require you NOT to kill mobs but since I'm higher level I onshot everything).

I'm level 80 and still in Eastern Kingdoms (started as a human), completing each area as I go and really enjoying it, not rushing to the newest raid or to get enough essence crap to be top or do the newest raids. They aren't going anywhere and then after a few years it will be all soloable anyways.

I'm NOT saying everyone should play like that, some of you are excited for Shadowlands and that's great, but I mean my playstyle does mean you give up being in competitive wow raids, but at least you have the option to have fun, no stress and still cope with real life.

Otherwise, hope you all are doing alright with the virus going around, I thought this could really help also to immerse some people and distract from the crap irl right now.

fnxh9o,Kimjongkung,When will disc start ”performing” again?,"So i started levling a disc awhile back, and i really enjoy it.
At the early stages i could obviously heal everything through, simply because disc does huge amount of damage.

I obviously know that would change, which it did around level 50, when classes got some AoE etc.
But even then i could atleast heal everyone safe and sound through atonement.

I know since before i started levling my character that one does not simply just heal through atonement, and you have to Bob and weave, which i had to start with around level 90-ish.
Around level 90-95 it felt like disc should feel, you heal through both atunement/talents (like Halo) and spot healing (started using the whole kit).

But as soon as i hit 100 it started to become a Shadow mend spam fest only.
Now i’m 103, and characters have like 19-30 k health, and my atonement smites heals for like 200-250.
Even If i use Schism and get a Power of the Dark side proc ontop of that, that usually amounts to like 1500-2000 healing, maybe 2500 with crits.

That healing is like putting a bandaid on a flesh wound If the tank is under pressure.
It’s not even enough to top off the DPS during enviromental damage (that’s not avoidable).

Disc went from stupidly strong up to lvl 90 roughly, then around those levels it felt good, like it should be.
But now around level 100 my atonement healing is not even enough to top up DPS that takes unavoidable enviromental damage, let alone even phase the tank.

So the question is, when will disc start to feel ”normal”?",5,1585018010,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fnxh9o/when_will_disc_start_performing_again/,wow,1

I actually want to enjoy and get into this game but I fear I may be too late. Im 33 years old and remember when this game was all the MMO players talked about. I feel like this is one of those ""you had to have started from the beginning"" situations. I have no friends that play this game either.


Any advice from vet players?",16,1585005205,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fnu6dv/decided_to_try_the_game_with_this_double_xp_going/,wow,1

fnu2w2,Aegeriel,"The Time Lost Proto Drake. My Story, 66 Hours, 1 Shard, 1 Mount.","This is the story of how I got my Time Lost Proto Drake. This happened 1 hour ago, I still can't believe it. It's long but it's a story about passion for the mount I've always wanted.  


When I was playing WoW as a kid with my older brother's  I was extremely young and knew almost nothing about the game, they were super awesome and would gear my characters and get me pretty much whatever I wanted in the game while trying to teach me. I liked mounts and seeing my brothers mounts and one day I asked my oldest brother about rare mounts and he told me about a mount so rare that it's just completely random if you get it. This mount was the Time Lost Proto Drake. I did some searching into it when I was young and I always told my self ""eventually one day, I'll find that mount."" I had pretty much no idea how to get it or any strategies since I was in fact a child but one day.  


Fast forward 10 years, I've got a few rare mounts (Riv's, Headless Horseman, GMOD, Other Rares) but I always go back to one mount that I've always wanted, the Time Lost Proto Drake. Whenever I thought Rare mount I always went to it first and kept thinking one day, I've a pretty grinder player now a days and when I am playing wow I'm super hard in. I just came back about a month ago and at 2am on Saturday I'm trying to find a mask run because I play Warlock and can't 5 mask on my own, scrolling I see a group title that instantly swapped gears. TLPD, Low Pop, Vyragosa Killed 12:18AM CST. I knew Vyragosa was the ""Less Rare"" Time Lost and I knew a little bit about the pathing and how it all worked but not much. I join the group and instantly watch a 22 minute guide on youtube (this one [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILb-056GyD0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILb-056GyD0)) to learn all I can about this bad boy, I open up the Wowhead article and get reading since I have time in between Vyragosa and what I thought would be my timelost. [https://www.wowhead.com/guides/time-lost-proto-drake-mount#cross-realm-zones-warmode](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/time-lost-proto-drake-mount#cross-realm-zones-warmode) What follows is madness.  


I decide, this is it, my free weekend, Coronavirus and all that people are in doors anyways, We are going to grind this out. So we waited and waited. Eventually we got to 4 Vyragosa spawns and I thought Wow, I'm getting timelost today but I'm so tired I will nap in the Vyragosa respawn period (2 hours without a possible spawn)  and I end up SLEEPING FOR 6 HOURS. I wake up thinking Timelost is dead but luckily I have the group leader added on RealID and I spam him trying to get back in the group for the next 7 hours getting updates and I thought these people are so determined I will never get a spot in this group again. Eventually they get a 7 HOUR 45 MINUTE Vyragosa Spawn (15 minutes from almost 100% being a time lost)  This is the 6th Vyragosa to die and Time lost is a \~10% for every Vyragosa and kills seem to be 6 Vyragosas = 1 Timelost.   


I rejoin the group and get some more members, we have all the data but now it is time to log it all and compile it all. I make a discord server and begin streaming the experience (vods @ [https://www.twitch.tv/aegeriel/videos](https://www.twitch.tv/aegeriel/videos)) It's all Vyragosa deaths. I become the leader of this group due to the dedication and hours I have put into the kill and the SHARD ISN'T EVEN ON MY SERVER Y'ALL. I'm an Area 52 Warlock camping in a Emerald Dream Shard, When the leader went to bed the server transferred to me and we made sure the shard didn't change by having me look at an herb for 3 hours (This herb happened to be on a spawnpoint and was nicknamed the ""Herb of Life"" by the group.) By this point about 11 players have tried at the Timelost in this group and I would say 7 of us REALLY wanted it. But I had become the leader and the one with the shard. FAST FORWARD after this brief interlude  


(I'm aware that I can get the time lost from the Secrets Finding Discord but my brothers and all the information around me had always described the timelost as a hunt. This was my hunt.)   


Eventually we get late into Day Two and I decide after a Vyra death I would risk sleeping (this is about 9 Vyragosas in so a Timelost is DUE on this shard) because I'm really into this girl and I decide of course that time with her is more important than any mount in wow. I log back in after 6 and a half hours, I'M STILL IN THE GROUP! They 4 manned the spawn points with no breaks apart from in between Vyra kills. This was the final straw, The timelost would be mine.   


I am given group leader again and at this point people are taking breaks and sleeping and the group is being rotated a bit but we land on a solid core of Me, A Rogue, A Demon Hunter and a Warrior with a flexible 5th of whoever is around. This was the dedicated group we had shared stories and got through the pain together. The time was unbearable and each Vyra kill hurt more than the last. It is monday by this point and I KNOW I need a kill before reset because @ Reset all the data no longer matters. 14 Vyragosa kills on the same shard. The herb of life guiding us, keeping us in place.  


In between kills our rogue played league, our demon hunter painted a shed, our warrior slept and what did I do? I KEPT THE SHARD ALIVE EVERY TIME. Not missing a beat. I had to be the leader I had to keep the Herb of life's guiding light, most importantly our data. After kill 6 I started timing every spawn and telling the group what was happening when.   


Late into the 6 hour mark, it finally happens, Our rogue messages everyone. PROTODRAKE SPAWN ON ME, PROTODRAKE. It was over, we all went over and after nervously pulling him over Ulduar for 4 minutes we had done it (with a druid) Sleep deprived, exhausted, frustrated, but happy. We got our Time Lost Proto Drakes, My hunt had ended.  My watch over Storm Peaks, had ended. It was a weird feeling leaving Storm Peaks, it feels like no time at all now and I'm back in Pandaria doing dailies.  The moral of the story is do what you always wanted to do in wow, unless it's farm the time lost proto drake because, it's torture. Use the secret finding discord don't be like me, unless you were also once told by your brother, about a rare spawn with flies around in Storm Peaks, and you can't help but hunt.

fnpo1k,Jochon,Useless vulpera,"I'm currently doing the quest to invite the vulpera into the Horde. I thought that I would maybe do the first part with the peons while those two other little furries dealt with the naga and the vintner, but lo and behold I just had to deal with the naga and now I'm on my way to the vintner as well.

Baine rejected their application because the Horde was stretched thin and couldn't afford to take in new members at the moment, and then Kiro (the fox boss) wanted to prove his value to the Horde by taking care of some of its business free of charge. Well, he hasn't so far! So far he's had me, one of the prime champions of the Horde, do all of his work for him! If anything, that dirty little dog boy has confirmed Baine's concerns, because he's been dragging me away from saving the world from the Old Gods and had me collect meat and give fake titles to overworked peons (and they deserve more money, not empty titles, by the way).  


You really shouldn't trust someone who lives in a caravan; there's usually a reason for why they like to be able to pack it all up and move on a moment's notice.

I'm looking around at what class to main in Shadowlands and my eyes fell on priest.
I read a lot of info about disci and shadow (and holy... The stepchild) and all the guides/videos say that both specs aren't good in mythic plus.

One step behind first.

My goal is to only run M+ and some sporadic hc raid in pug since work shifts are horribile. If in raids my goals are pretty low, in mythic I'd like to reach +20 or so since it's an ""on demand"" content.

I fear that I'd invest in the worst possible class for the content I want to do :(

fnlo09,ChapterMasterSalt,I just realized why trolls are so prominent in the game (aka Azeroth is the planet of furries),"If you take a look at the number of dungeons, raids and zones, trolls have an unusual amount of representation compared to many of the other races. Which players have been fine with, having a troll-related raid almost every expansion is basically a tradition.

One could say this eventually became about having a troll raid just for the sake of having a troll raid, but I realized, having a troll raid just for the sake of it is actually a lore friendly move.

Why?

Of all the playable races listed below, the bolded ones are the only ones naturally native to Azeroth:

---

~~Human~~ /
~~Dwarf~~ /
~~Gnome~~ /
~~Night Elf~~ /
~~Draenei~~ /
~~Worgen~~ /
~~LF Draenei~~ /
~~Void Elf~~ /
~~Kul Tiran~~ /
~~Mechagnome~~ /
~~Orc~~ /
**Troll** /
**Tauren** /
~~Undead~~ /
~~Blood Elf~~ /
~~Goblin~~ /
~~Maghar Orc~~ /
~~Nightborne~~ /
**Highmountain** /
**Zandalari** /
**Vulpera** 

---

Yep, you see that correctly. These 5 races are the only naturally-occurring races on Azeroth.

Every other race on that list is either:

- an invasive species 
- descended from Titan creations
- a result of artificial selection (magic for elves, Mimiron for goblins)

So while elves and goblins are in a gray area, because they're descended from natural species, their evolutions weren't actually natural so we can't use them to represent what native Azeroth life forms would look like under normal circumstances.

If no old gods or titans had ever found Azeroth, this would be an MMO about furries and trolls.",80,1584976759,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fnlo09/i_just_realized_why_trolls_are_so_prominent_in/,wow,1

I have been getting upgrades that are iLevel 410 from the vendor and 425 from TW dungeon drops. These are massive upgrades over the gear I had. I just found out from a friend that I should not have replaced the shoulders I had that had the additional artifact abilities. Why do they even make items for those slots that have a higher ilevel if you aren't supposed to use them!? Did I miss an explanation somewhere that told me to make sure not to get rid of these pieces? The vendor even offers a couple neck slot pieces that I almost bought because the iLevel was so much higher than the Heart of Azeroth, but I figured I should probably hold onto that one since it seemed pretty important. 

This isn't the only example however. Before I level capped, only a couple of days ago, I was working though the Legion content, specifically to get my class mount and to unlock Highmountain and Nightborne. I had some dungeon quests I needed to do for the class hall and couldn't figure out how to get into them because they were gone from the dungeon finder. I ended up having the same friend run me through those dungeons so I could complete the quests.

I had a couple other examples, but you get the idea. I know there a lot of resources I can use for different quest chains and guides and I can google a lot of things, but the thing about the item upgrades, why would I google that. It seemed intuitive to upgrade from 280 shoulders to 410 shoulders.

However, I recently got some new hardware are forgot to backup my addon/interface folder and I was able to recover all my addon except for for the one above. I had been using this addon for years so it is possible it doesn't exist anymore but I just though maybe one of yall could help. The link I posed is for a UI suite but I just wanted the specific action bar styler addon.

Right now I am working on the Suramar quest line, and i have the quest “The Stuff of Dreams” where I have to collect the “Purified Life Essence” after killing the final boss (Xavius) in the raid of the Emerald Dreamway (the Rift of Aln). I have done this raid twice now and I still don’t get the option to loot this essence at the end. I am afraid this will mess up with my pathfinder unlock.

""Pref premade"" - the chances of a premade being out there, first of all is so low, then, second of all, wanting to do that key specifically or that premade missing a person whose role you'd fit at that exact same moment is literally lower than us discovering the secret to the universe.

""Check rio"" - Doesn't everyone do it by default?

""In time"" - Wait. You can predict how a run's gonna go before you even start it or are you saying that you wanna do exactly what 100% of the people doing keys wanna do, that is, to do it in time?

""Push"" - Well, this is kinda ok since, all in all, no matter your level, it's still a challenge to you, however, when the baseline difficulty of, say,  a +15 is dogpoo due to ilvl/corruptions, exactly what's the challenge behind it?

fne8w0,PokerFist,The Adventure of having Alts in 8.3,"First of all, i'd like to start this off by saying that i've got an actively Mythic-Raiding main character, aswell as 5/6 active alts that i'm playing additionally (insert Thanos' 'They called me a madman' here) and i just thought to myself : Why not share the experience of someone that's actively playing all these characters in a more or less serious manner (alt Raids, keys up to 16/17 etc.)   


1. The Cloak

Oh goddamn it, let's start off with the part that was absolutely the worst initially : Getting this cloak on every alt has left a serious mental damage in my brain. I get it, we could skip two scenarios (Why not the third though ? Cmon Blizz, noone wants to save Wrathions sorry ass from BWD more than once) but the sheer amount of flying that was required for the questchain was incredibly tedious and just... unnecessary for something that could've been skipped altogether except for the eventual rewards.

But fine, i've grinded the cloak on more characters than i'd like to admit, fine !   
Except for the fact that it wasn't fine  


1.1 Upgrading your cloak  


I've had legitimate fun with Horrific Visions on my main, aswell to a lesser extent with my alts, as they present different challenges depending on what character you enter them with, i'm not tooo upset about doing these (although i absolutely get if people are) except for them becoming a little tedious aswell when you're doing them with quite some characters(Only really grinding them up in Orgrimmar btw, Stormwind vision hate club arise !) But... the assaults. Those goddamn, unnecessarily grindy pieces of \*\*content\*\*, that you need to do on EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER, EACH WEEK aslong as you want to get your cloak up to date. There's just an arbitrary amount of mind-numbingly boring grind-content, which is practically required to be somewhat competitive with whatever you're playing (Atleast they give currency for the new accountwide-essences too though, so they feel a LITTLE more worth atleast) Even with the obscene amount of time given to me at the moment due to the current situation, i'm not really able to keep up those characters properly (talking 12-14+ hours per day of playing) but partly just because of the fact that i can't stand to do the assaults over, and over, and over, and over again

&amp;#x200B;

2. Corruption

....Sigh

I don't even know where to start with the corruption anymore, the problems have been repeated often enough, but atleast you can get excited that you're alts are getting all the corruption that your main would technically need, while not being able to equip them since their cloak isn't high enough yet (yay !)

&amp;#x200B;

3. Essences

Alright, of course there is enough hate to be given on the essence system from start to now, but... the way that they've added alt-friendly essence acquisition now actually made the game much, much more enjoyable to me and actually lead to an increase of fun to be had in BFA again (fun in BFA kappa hmm ?) 

&amp;#x200B;

There are probably tons of things i'm even missing right now for alts that i'm not even aware of anymore or just don't care about enough, feel free to give any more examples down below :D

fnbj8e,Kenkillya,Anyone else having party and/or sync/phase issues? I'm super frustrated at the moment.,"Like most of you my wife and I are taking advantage of the xp buff to level alts. We've had a terrible time with syncing and phasing. We are on connected realms Nathrezim and Garithos. Below are a few examples.

1. She had a 98 Priest and a 90 Warlock we wanted to get to 100 for legion invasions. I partied with her on my 120 Pally to knock out a few bonus objectives but couldn't see her no matter what we tried. Tried sync on and off, different zones, everything. Finally I logged on my 100 Priest and could see her and got it done.

2. This morning she got on her 90 Warlock I got my 120 Pally but again couldn't see her. I switched to my 100 Monk and we were able to see each other. I had done all the bonus objectives previously but when we turned on party sync they all showed up on my map. We started in Frostfire everything going good. However once we hit Gorgrond, I could see all of the bonus objectives and she could not. We even flew to their locations so the area was discovered and they never popped up in either her quest tracker or map. If I left party they disappeared off my map only to reappear when joining a party with her and turning sync back on eventually we gave up.

3. Last night she created a Demon Hunter and finished the starting area at 106. I jumped onto my level 100 Shaman and we did the legion invasions together. My Shaman hit 104 and her DH 108. We logged off in Thunder Totem. Tonight we logged back in and couldn't see each other in Thunder Totem regardless of party or sync status. We hearthed to Dalaran and had the same problem. I switched to my 110 DH and still no dice. We could see each other's dot on the map but party, no party, sync or no sync we couldn't see each other. We just logged for the night out of frustration.",2,1584927290,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fnbj8e/anyone_else_having_party_andor_syncphase_issues/,wow,1

fnailr,Erebusgaming,Discussion: Bring Back Master Looter,"Now before you go on a hate-fueled rant about how master looter was ""bad for the game"" let me explain my points.  
PROS

1. Master Looter prevented an underperforming player(s) from receiving loot they did not earn.
   1. Underperforming - Not committing to mechanics, is performing extremely low DPS or HPS, or is dying 30 seconds into a pull every pull.
2. Master Looter gave greater control to guild runs that were forced to pug in 1 or 2 players.
   1. Pugging is a part of life and when ML was a thing a PUG that was joining a raid would normally form an agreement with the raids RL to receive a specific piece or pieces of gear.  This would be in exchange for their attendance/performance in their guild run.
   2. Since every single thing has moved on to Personal Loot it has greatly impacted Guilds' willingness to bring in pug players into progression pulls for heroic or mythic to prevent random players from getting loot.
3. Master Looter took away the feeling of no control over gear.
   1. How many times has a player in a raid gotten a duplicate piece or a lesser piece that they don't need but simply kept it because they want the TMOG or they just aren't willing to trade?  ML with a loot council would look at everyone's gear and distribute loot to those that needed it the most that fit the looting requirements.

Cons

1. Master Looter created a pretty elitist mentality in many small-time guilds by giving them an over-inflated sense of authority over pug players.
2. Master Looter was abused by certain guilds (which would always get posted to the forums, reddit, etc) for going back on agreements made for loot.

But all I found is disappointment. Not only do legacy raiding guilds seem to have gone largely extinct since MoP, after I attempted to create my own legacy raiding guild I simply got laughed at while advertising it. Searching through the official forums and Reddit didn't help much either, as what little I could find was largely outdated and exclusively on US servers.

fn426t,happily_fred,Another Voldunai rep question,"Hi all,

I'm grinding rep for Voldunai and the Unshakled at the moment and had a question about faction rep vs area rep. When I complete a not area specific  faction (say Champions of Azeroth) quest in Vol'dun, I get 125 rep for the faction and 75 area rep for Voldunai. But when I complete a Voldunai world quest in Vol'dun I only get the 75 area rep. I only noticed this when I started grinding, and figured it was just how it was. 

Then I noticed when I completed a Zandalari world quest in Zuldazar I get 100 faction rep and 75 area rep. I \*think\* when I'm running world quests in Nazjatar I'm only getting the 75 area rep there. 

Is this just how the different factions are setup or am I missing a questline to unlock the extra rep from world quests for a few factions?

Hello everyone. I hope quarantine/2020 is treating you well.

About a year ago, I got a promotion at work that meant I didn't really have time to play online anymore. Now, I griped plenty about BFA and... well, everything about it and had intended on taking a break until next expansion anyway, but work just made it so that I was basically choosing between getting enough sleep or eating every night, so gaming wasn't an option. 

Well, then a kerfuffle happened and my ex-girlfriend decided we should delete our accounts. I was already taking a break but no, absolutely not, I had mounts, titles, gear, etc that could never be replaced. I'm already not playing and that's enough. So we both froze our accounts.

Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I got laid off because high end retail isn't ""essential"" and no, it is not, but now I have lots of spare time since I can't find a job. I download the launcher, enter my info, and I'm prompted to make an account. Huh.

Well, okay. So I do, and I dive in to heroes of the storm as.. a fresh level 1? Well, it's been over a year, and the game's been dying. Maybe this is just a thing. But no, my first quick match had someone with level 1700 something. 

So I contact my ex, who told me that yeah, she had a little bit to drink, and I left my info at home, and we'd been together for so long that she knew the answers to all my secret questions, so she went ahead and deleted our accounts that day she talked about it so we wouldn't be tempted to go back.

Anyway, there's a reason she's my ex. Well, lots.

I'm guessing that's all, everything's gone, and since I'm out of the job and have no income, I can't really buy everything and start over, even if I want to and simultaneously the prospect breaks my heart and is kind of exciting in it's own way. Has anyone recovered from this, or is it much more likely gone forever?",4,1584893202,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fn1zce/woke_ex_had_my_account_deleted_about_a_year_ago/,wow,1

They no longer will need to treat specialization as almost their own classes but manage class as a whole.

What leads me tot his belief? 

1. We won't get unique looking class armor sets, at least at the beginning of the Shadowlands.

2. Shadowlands will come without new race and class. It is true that we will get new customization options but those don't require animations and much in terms of rigging, two the most expensive and time consuming things.

So either Shadowlands are meant to be WoD like filler and the next expansion will be huge or it is a sign of WoW's detoriation. I think it might be the latter considering BfA can't be exactly called a prime expansion.",4,1584889220,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fn1479/is_the_return_of_focus_on_class_instead_of_spec_a/,wow,1

It was always so difficult to level as a group, because one person would inevitably pull ahead. And the 119 levels you had to go through first used to be such a big road block when it came to playing together. Not anymore! 

The fact that you can even play BGs and arenas with your lower level friends is a big, fat cherry on top. What would leveling be without the occasional BG? 

So yeah, party-sync is great. The best feature of BfA if you will, (and it will become even better once they fix the leveling in Shadowlands). An unironic well done from me, Blizzard. 👍

fmzjjv,TwidgeMC,"I can no longer justify my friends getting into group content at any level, and it devastates me","I miss the days when I could bring my friends with me into World of Warcraft.

My friends and I, like many others, are staying at home due to the coronavirus outbreak. We have a weekly D&amp;D game that we've moved online, but naturally all of us are a bit sad we can't meet up so we've been looking for other things to do. One of the D&amp;D players also used to play WoW, and she suggested we all start new characters together. We'll call her Sarah. That's not her real name.

""Great!"" I thought. I've been a WoW player on and off since TBC, and I've already got curve for Ny'alotha, so I was more than happy to guide people through the new player experience. Everyone makes trial accounts, and we start new characters. We picked Doomhammer, as it's a server for new players.

People find fun in different places. Sarah spent her time reminiscing about the old raids she used to do in TBC, and how everything is really different now - Hunter ammunition is gone, for example. My girlfriend has played through eg. Breath of the Wild, but wasn't really prepared for the sheer size of the world and was enjoying seeing all the sights.

We hit Level 15, and I suggested we do a dungeon.

I often liken dungeons in WoW to rollercoaster rides in a theme park. It's a linear experience that you queue for. You might be a little nervous before some of them, and sometimes it's kinda stressful during it, but at the end you get off the ride and you think ""that was okay! I want to do that again"". Then, you can go back on the same ride, or you can go on another ride. Some rides are scarier than others - I'm looking at you, Cathedral of Eternal Night.

When I started playing back in TBC, Deadmines was the thing that hooked me. I went in with my brother and a group of three random people, and by the end of that dungeon I'd decided this world was where I wanted to spend all my time. That experience may not be the same for other people, but - even though it's changed - seeing a huge underground ship, dodging cannonballs and hopping in giant mechanical harvesters is still probably the coolest thing you can do on a trial account.

One player had dropped out to go take a nap, so we queued up as a group of three. I went in as a tank so I could set the pace and guide everyone through without them having to find their way (I tank M+ on my alt and am quite used to it). I equipped all my non-XP heirlooms. I suggested they queue as DPS as it's the most relaxing role, particularly for newer players. I was excited! My friends were going to have fun together.

Except it didn't really turn out like that.

Our first healer left in the middle of the Glubtok fight. Our extra DPS ran through the dungeon pulling everything ahead of me because I was too slow, despite me mentioning I was going to take it easy for my party's benefit. Our second healer started a kick vote for the extra DPS with simply the message ""r\*\*\*\*d"" - censored so this post isn't auto-removed - proceeded to belittle everybody's DPS and call us ""sad"" (we were in quest rewards and some green drops) and then left in the middle of another boss fight, leaving us all to die.

Throughout all of this, we didn't flame anyone. We didn't snap back. We just carried on trying to have fun, until - eventually - we stopped having fun.

And, throughout the whole of the experience, I felt awful: awful that my friends were being shouted at by someone over the internet when they just wanted to enjoy themselves; awful that this content that I loved and grew up with is now effectively off-limits to groups of new players; awful that it was *me* who'd brought them here.

WoW is where I go to chill now. Even at the worst of times, I don't let myself shout or snap at people because I know they're just there, like me, to escape from the other things that stress them out. I'm the guy that posts friendly cliff notes for bosses in LFR after wipes, and has /rw macros to try and help people understand what to do. I don't get angry when they die. I don't get angry when people do low DPS in a dungeon, or don't know the mechanics. If they're dying on a particular mechanic and it's hindering the group's progress, I just tell them what it is they need to do to stop dying, in a nice and gentle way, with no swearing or shouting. As weird as it sounds, I even take pride in using ""the Patient"" as my title across all my characters, and my friends will attest to that being my nature.

It feels, though, like an uphill battle that I'll never win. It feels like people have forgotten how to empathise, and forgotten what being new to something is like. It feels like no matter how much I help or teach, there will be two other people who will write snarky putdowns and call people idiots.

If you drive a taxi and an old person needs some help getting in the back of the car, you wouldn't stand there and shout or even be passive-aggressive at them for not being able to do what other people can. Yet, somehow, this behaviour is commonplace and acceptable in all group content in WoW, regardless of level.

This post isn't looking for solutions, or me being angry; it's just me being sad, and needing a place to express that sadness. I feel awful that I recommended the game I love to my friends. It's horrible.",31,1584881821,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fmzjjv/i_can_no_longer_justify_my_friends_getting_into/,wow,1

I’m going to be attempting to solo 5 mask clears next week. My DH is around ilvl 476 and with 4 Titan research panel options missing (have all the important ones). 

I know the routes as well as which consumables to use. The only thing I’m wary about is that the only corruptions i have are echoing void II on 2 lvl 475 pieces of gear. Additionally, I have better azerite traits for vengeance than havoc on 480 pieces. 

Having said thus, what have been your experiences blazing through visions with both specs? If I’ve missed out on any required info, please do let me know and I’ll provide it so that you can perhaps advise me better.

Being able to play on the very very offensive while still having some defensive abilities
Big numbers, more specific big dps CD’s that you can control, like a 5 point eviscerate, not just a crit
Being able to control the fight, via stuns resource deplenishment etc

I also had tried to get it to go to the tank's target, but it was limiting me so that if I had to be on an interrupt target that wasn't the tank's target, and also that he would need to target something in general.

I'm fairly certain that the /combat option only checks whether or not I am in combat before allowing macro to go off.

fms257,CunningJack,Help with dealing more damage.,"Hello all,

I'm still very new to Warcraft in general, my brother got me into it about 2 months ago. I've played Runescape and Guild Wars a bit in the past, but I really feel like the vibe of wow is much more what I've been looking for all along. By far and large, the best part of the game for me has been how great the community is. After playing League of Legends for way too long, you guys rock!

Anyway, as the post suggests, I'm having trouble with putting out damage the way I'd like to in PvE. I've been switching around between Priest, Shaman, Rogue and Druid mostly, but no matter which class I go with someone always comes running along, wrecks an entire army of kobolds or blood trolls in a flash, and I get mad envy. I don't think they're modding the game at all, and I don't think that I have such a huge skill gap that I'm not rotating spells properly either.

I'm wondering if there is something I am doing wrong. I have a lot to learn about this AMAZING game, and I can't wait to get crackin' even harder with this whole quarantine situation going down (Math teacher here... home for the rest of the school year :D)

Any advice at all would be MUCH appreciated, and I'll keep checking this thread to see if there are any questions I can help clarify as I'm sure I left out a lot of useful information.

I'm currently playing an Arcane Mage, and I have the skill ""remove curse."" I'm used to the UI of GW2 where buffs and debuffs showed up under the party on the left side of the screen. Since there was nothing there in WoW, I figured that there just wasn't any debuffing going on.

Then I clicked on an ally and saw some of the debuffs they had. I don't know if those are classified under ""curses"" or not, but I'd like to at least be able to see them while playing.

I tried installing ElvUI, but even after spending nearly an hour customizing it, it just changed too much. I really like the original UI in many ways, and I absolutely love the font. The UI is critical for immersion for me in a game, and I don't just want it to be a number pusher.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a UI addon that doesn't radically ruin the look and feel of the game, but still improves the game a bit?

However, with the current 100% xp boost they just implemented, it seems that right now is a better time to level alts.  

So my question to anyone that's already done so, how long did it take you to level from 110-120 just via questing, utilizing an almost-full heirloom sets (minus the ring) and the current 100% xp boost.

fmj7t9,hermitxd,Can we talk about Arcane?,"Arcane has been in a sore spot all expansion, it has had a few boss were it has been viable but at no point has it been  satisfying gameplay. Players commonly note that arcane is dull , people will often mention how you only cast damage 3 spells in your single target rotation. Arcane blast, arcane missiles and arcane barrage. It's true, but also we deal with balancing our mana. Not much of a caveat, but it's often overlooked by other players and is actually very punishing if you mess it up. Our current niche compared to the competing arcane specs is pure ST, prefably with low movement. On demand burst(fire does this too) 

I'm not the type of person who could write an interesting wall of text so I'll get my points and suggestions out in bullet points mostly.




**Arcane Missiles**

**Complaints**

- Less damage than our filler. 

- Not exciting when it procs

- You ignore the proc under certain circumstances, as it's a dps loss.

Arcane missiles was exciting in legion in the following ways.

- Damage increase, this made proc  satisfying.

- Rule of 3s could proc(doubling it's damage). 

- Ability to stack 3, whicg synergied with a talent (slipstream) giving arcane spec-unique mobility options. Which added a layer of planning and skill to arcane. 

- You felt like a freaking machine gun.

**Suggestions** to make arcane viable in more circumstances.

- Arcane orb baseline.

- Supernova damage balanced similar to Did.

- Give back some of the legion arcane missiles gameplay.

I don't think the above suggestions is enough, but I do think if numbers were balanced right it would give arcane a few gcd's of mobility, while also giving us a little cleave. (without putting us above fires cleave)

I'm content with arcanes niche, all I'd like is for arcane to feel more viable in cleave situations without giving up your ST.

What are your suggestions for arcane if you're a fan of the spec?",35,1584813992,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fmj7t9/can_we_talk_about_arcane/,wow,1

fmh6jy,Farthix,Undercutting responsibly on the new AH and YOU.,"I was going to post this on /r/woweconomy but I figured if anyone understands this it would be them.

The reason I make this post is to tell anyone who needs to hear it to STOP UNDERCUTTING BY SO MUCH when you post auctions.

The way the new AH works make it so selling something so cheap wont guarantee it to be sold faster. All it does is lower the price of the item for everyone selling it, the next person, or someone else checking their auction is just going to match you.

Example: 250 volatile life listed at 40g each, random dude comes in and posts 5 at 30g, 2 hours later 1000 are posted at 30g each and those 5 never sold.

Most people don't pay much attention and just post at what ever the lowest price is, costing everyone selling that item gold.

Undercutting by silvers/coppers at a time also doesn't need to be done anymore but at least it doesn't hurt all that much.

Maybe I am raging, idk. But please stop undercutting by 10-30%. It's pointless and you are costing everyone, including yourself, gold.

Thank you

I am just trying to avoid being the judge of which dates are important to post.

Each of these numbers are the number of days between the launch of the expansion in question to the launch date of the next pre-patch.

* 'The Burning Crusade' lasted 637 days.

* 'Wrath of the Lich King' lasted 698 days.

* 'Cataclysm' lasted 630 days.

* 'Mists of Pandaria' lasted 749 days.

* 'Warlords of Draenor' lasted 614 days.

* 'Legion' lasted 686 days.

Keep in mind that almost all pre-patches in WoW's history have  come out only a month before the expansion launch.

* If *Battle for Azeroth* lasts as long as *Warlords of Draenor,* then the *Shadowlands* pre-patch would release April 18, 2020.

* If *Battle for Azeroth* lasts as long as the average of the even numbered expansions, then the *Shadowlands* pre-patch would release May 1, 2020.

* If *Battle for Azeroth* lasts as long as *Cataclysm,* then the *Shadowlands* pre-patch would release May 4, 2020.

* If *Battle for Azeroth* lasts as long as *The Burning Crusade,* then the *Shadowlands* pre-patch would release May 11, 2020.

* If *Battle for Azeroth* lasts as long as *Legion,* then the *Shadowlands* pre-patch would release June 29, 2020.

* If *Battle for Azeroth* lasts as long as *Wrath of the Lich King,* then the *Shadowlands* pre-patch would release July 11, 2020.

* If *Battle for Azeroth* lasts as long as the average of the even numbered expansions, then the *Shadowlands* pre-patch would release July 24, 2020.

* If *Battle for Azeroth* lasts as long as *Mists of Pandaria,* then the *Shadowlands* pre-patch would release August 31, 2020.

* If the *Shadowlands* prepatch is released in September, then *Battle for Azeroth* will be the longest expansion in WoW's history.

fmc1jp,skiazomai,Serious Havoc DH Talent Idea," 

So, I am aware of the current state of havoc and I agree it could be tuned down a bit. Because of this, I usually see a lot of people hating on new ideas and theories about how the spec could play simply because they want it nerfed. Even though we are performing extremely well currently, it doesn't mean our spec doesn't have some pretty obvious shortcomings and potential knots to be worked out.

One of those things I think doesn't really feel well on our spec is Throw Glaive. I love the idea of the ability, and its great for vengeance, but on havoc it feels a bit empty. I love the feeling of VRing out of a pack or running from an AoE and then instinctually throwing glaive. The only problem is that it barely does anything and is more an APM loss than an actual gain, yet I still cant seem to stop doing it habitually.

So that got me thinking, how could Throw Glaive be made to feel badass? We used to have Bloodlet and that was super good (note: broken) and cool, but its old hat. Here's my suggestion:

New Havoc Talent:

Weighted Glaives: Throw Glaive's cooldown is increased to 15 seconds, but also interupts spellcasting on the first target struck when used on a target greater than 15 yards away.

Again, numbers are just napkin sketch at this point, but you get the general idea.

I feel like this would really feel and play well on havoc, and would create a lot of interesting gameplay and strategic decision making for an otherwise pretty lackluster havoc ability. It would play extremely synergistically with our current toolkit in Vengeful Retreat and Fel Rush.

I also particularly enjoy how this ability fits fantasy wise, as having a heavier glaive would likely force you to throw it less often, however it would definitely stagger anyone it hit. I also really like the idea of having a ranged only interrupt on a melee class.

Anyways let me know what you think in the comments!",1,1584780309,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fmc1jp/serious_havoc_dh_talent_idea/,wow,1

This is going to be super controversial but I do not really care, this is my opinion about classic in a nutshell.

Well first of all I have years of being a wow player and I would say pretty hardcore at that. I started in late BC and played all through WOTLK clearing all the content fully that the expansion provided then later on quit around early cataclysm. I did however play during legion but have not played the previous/further expansions. During wotlk i would say i was pretty hard-core as i had nothing better to do during high-school. I cleared everything on HC difficulty and I was an achievement whore with over 8k points so i think i know what I am talking about.

**Classes**

* **Pros**: There are restrictions on classes, I guess.  can’t really write anything here tbh. maybe how there are class determining stuff like paladin seals, warrior stances and shaman totems. Don’t get me wrong, I liked the talent system where you could experiment with stuff and I like the progression feeling what learning new skills from the trainer provide.

* **Cons**:
The classes are unbalanced, nothing is optimized properly there are entire talent trees that are straight up useless and count as memes (don’t even try to argue how any tank other than warrior is good or feral dps for instance). I know that there are tons of guild that are not min-maxing (Praise the only dwarf guild) and there are more options to experiment but certain classes are just locked to certain roles and there is nothing you can do about it. The rotations are boring as you most likely will spam 1 key for the whole fight as a dps.



**Instances/Raiding**

* **Pros**:
There is something cool about 40 people working together to clear an instance. The guild runs are fun and you do have to interact with other people just to clear a 5man dungeon.

* **Cons**:
Instances are huge, it takes a long time just to run through it after you cleared the instance since they were not designed for farming and devs thought it would be a one-time experience. I literally feel bored just about the thought of going through maraudon one more time. The tactics for the bosses are easy and not that challenging what proves it more than apes just cleared it in greens and with characters not even being lvl60. You need a lot of time and resources to prepare for a raid because of the consumables you have to collect for it. 

**Leveling/Questing**

* **Pros**:
It is nice to not do quests alone and in classic you are basically forced to do stuff in parties. Personally, this is the only Pro for me, but I am open for arguments.

* **Cons**:
Killing mobs is just tedious as hell. There is nothing “challenging” about killing a fucking wolf just because I oom after I casted frost bolt 3 times. There is nothing fun about dying just because I accidentally pulled 2 mobs and not just one. I hate how you have to sit down for minutes eating to complete a simple kill quest. There are not nearly enough quests to level up until 60 comfortably. A lot of them are just blatant kill this kill that, collect some stuff without any story or lore behind it. I understand that not all the quests should have essays written about them, but I like how later expansions became more and more story focused with long quest chains about the lore itself. 

**Community**

* **Pros**: 
As far as I was following the subreddit and YouTube videos the community is there, there are a lot of new guide/lore/meme videos being made each day and there is a lot of discussion about random stuff. If you want to ask for help in the game, it is most likely people are going to help out sometimes even going out of their way which is pretty cool. The cities are filled with people and it gives you this warm feeling whenever you visit a city. There are many guilds that are not focusing on min-maxing and are focusing on the community aspect, that is the only reason my friend still plays this game. 

* **Cons**:
I hate how the “real gamer” praise this garbage ass game as it was made by gods and there is nothing wrong with it. You can still see some people on twitch and YouTube who won’t stop praising the game. Most people I know who started playing simply quit because of sheer boredom or they only log on for raids. These people just can’t seem to take off their rose-tinted glasses and look away at all the unfun aspects of the game. Like a content creator in his YouTube video he straight up said “you just got to kill mobs one by one sitting in your underwear watching Netflix on your other monitor.” Yeah, I see how fun the game can be when you do not have to give a shit about it.

***Just straight up complaints***

for some it might be nitpicks, but I do not care this is my opinion.
 
**Downtime**

I really hate how everything takes ages. No, I am not talking about leveling, I am talking about simple stuff like professions, travelling, basically doing stuff. I already talked about how you have to sit down after every mob you kill, I hate how everything  that you do takes an unreasonably long time [20s for fishing… really?] such as gathering stuff or mounting up. I would also put in here the searching for a dungeon group, but I do not want to get into that because it divides the community. Personally, I do not mind the dungeon finder (not the raid finder) if I want to go and clear an instance I do not want to spend an hour just to establish a proper group so maybe I can fly to a zone which is minutes away just to disband the group after wiping once. Now here comes the rant about being a single dad having 5 kids on two jobs and I only have time to play 10minutes a day. Even if I have time and can play the whole day, I do not want to waste it on this. 

**Quality of life** 

I do not like how you have to use an addon just to see how much your stuff can be sold to a vendor for or to see a mobs hp, or how you have to stand up for casting a spell. Also, the fucking wait time when looting a mob or buying/selling items to a vendor. I liked the mount/pet tab and the achievements that was introduced with WOTLK. It made me want to play the game more and more and sorry, but I do like how my consumables can be stacked for a reasonable amount and does not fill up my bag space.

**Graphics** 

I get it, yeah this is an old game but yeah guess what it is 2020. As I was playing legion, I loved the new character models, I loved the new animations it did bring. I really wanted the option to change between new/old graphics but unfortunately that was not the case. I really despise looking at the old animations, spells without cool effects or some stuff without animation at all. The gear just looks terrible. I like the fact how there is no transmog and you can see the time and progress on some of the players put into it but most of the old gear looks like shit (this might be the most controversial sentence). 

***Possible “dumb arguments”***

&gt; **-“but your character is not powerful why would it have good looking items”**

well sorry I do like to look cool in game no matter how powerful I am. Just because 

&gt; **-“but it is all about experiencing the game not min-maxing”**

Yeah, I get it how for some of the people it might be a new and fun experience but I have played this game for years and the most fun I had was in endgame content not while leveling. I could not care less about “exploring” anymore. Yes I did explore it multiple times, questing wise I even had the Loremaster achievement I have had enough “experiencing”.


&gt; **-“but all classes and specs are viable”**

Sure buddy... https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/031/021/cover2.jpg

&gt; **-“but the game is still fun”**

I only said that I do not enjoy the game I never said you should not like it. You love playing? Good for you I seriously am happy for it. World of warcraft has to be my favorite game ever made period. I just do not play it. I still enjoy reading the subreddit and watching the videos about it.

I get it, yeah this is an old game but yeah guess what it is 2020. As I was playing legion, I loved the new character models, I loved the new animations it did bring. I really wanted the option to change between new/old graphics but unfortunately that was not the case. I really despise looking at the old animations, spells without cool effects or some stuff without animation at all. The gear just looks terrible. I like the fact how there is no transmog and you can see the time and progress on some of the players put into it but most of the old gear looks like shit (this might be the most controversial sentence). 

***Possible “dumb arguments”***

&gt; **-“but your character is not powerful why would it have good looking items”**

well sorry I do like to look cool in game no matter how powerful I am. Just because 

&gt; **-“but it is all about experiencing the game not min-maxing”**

Yeah, I get it how for some of the people it might be a new and fun experience but I have played this game for years and the most fun I had was in endgame content not while leveling. I could not care less about “exploring” anymore. Yes I did explore it multiple times, questing wise I even had the Loremaster achievement I have had enough “experiencing”.


&gt; **-“but all classes and specs are viable”**

Sure buddy... https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/031/021/cover2.jpg

&gt; **-“but the game is still fun”**

I only said that I do not enjoy the game I never said you should not like it. You love playing? Good for you I seriously am happy for it. World of warcraft has to be my favorite game ever made period. I just do not play it. I still enjoy reading the subreddit and watching the videos about it.

I have mained hunter since WOTLK but I've gotten quite interested with the idea of tanking. 

What I'm looking for is personal opinion and description regarding the gameplay of the different tanks.I will prefer doing heroic raids and perhaps some low M+ keys. I don't want to pay too much attention to the current meta.

I have tanked as a DH at 120. They're really fun with their mobility. I don't mind having a bit of downtime for mitigation. I just have a hard time with the fantasy of the class.

I also have a Brewmaster at 90 but I'm not sure I really like the stagger idea. I'd rather block the damage.

I want to share you a fan fiction I wrote. It's will be a miniseries with a few chapters about a Monk and a Demon Hunter. They will meet with each other later on because on their own they are trying to find an answer to prevent coming darkness (patch 8.3).  
I'm not a native english speaker. In fact I'm preparing for my language exam after the schools will reopen.  
Please enjoy and leave a coment if I should stop :D

  

Alaness the Slayer.  
 Vengeance Incarnate.   
 Demon Slayer.   
 Many titles obtained in a few months.  
 The Demon Hunter was deep in his thoughts. After he sacrificed the powers of his artifact he tought peace will follow the end of the invasion. Then the Warchief of the Horde changed everything.   
 He burned Teldrassil.   
 The anger within the Night Elves of the Illidari was just as strong as was against the Legion.   
 They left the Illidari to protect their people and help the Alliance against the Horde.   
 They have seen Sylvanas just as dangerous as the legion was, because no one knows where she will strike again.

“Lord Illidan’s last message to you was to protect Azeroth, Alaness. You should have joined us along with the Blood Elves. You maybe the chosen of Lord Illidan but you are betraying his last wish” Kor’vas strike harshly on Alaness. She visits the the Fel Hammer every week only to convince him to join them.   
 Now that they helped to save Azeroth, their people have started to see the actions, the atrocities they have commited in the name of Illidan Stormrage as the means to save Azeroth.   
 And they accepted it. They could re-join their people like the Death Knights did years ago.   
 Some of them however allied themselves with warlocks to hunt down the remaining demons of Azeroth.  
 *I could not bring myself to leave the Fel Hammer and choose a side in this War…*  
 “You know I can’t do that and neither will the Sin’dorei of the Illidari.” Alaness answered.   
 *Some of my brethren already left to Silvermoon as an act to recreate the ties with our capital. Only a few of us remained here* *not including Kayn.*  
 “We already started to study the Void to prevent the horrors they are capable of.” The expedition to Argus shown everyone that the Light is not as holy as most of the champions of Azeroth thought and the Void isn’t as deadly and dangerous as the Old Gods and their minions showed it.   
 Alleria Windrunner is a prime example of the fact that the Void can be controlled to an extent.    
 *But a Death Knight who is contact with Magni Bronzebeard told us that the Old Gods tried to obtain the Heart of Azeroth. They are the darkest manifestation of the Void. In their twisted ways they can pose a much bigger threat than the Legion did.*  
 “The war will help the Old Gods, you have seen how a fragment of their power nearly destroyed the Emerald Dream. Slowly they will corrupt the world, Kor’vas. We have to act as fast as we can.”   
 “If we could defeat the Horde as fast as we can and avenge the dead we could focus to fight against them…but I wasted enough time here. Farewell Alaness”   
 Kor’vas sued the portal of Mother to leave.  
 Just as she entered into the portal another figure stepped out of it.  
 “I have returned, my Lord”   
 The voice came from Sevis Brightflame. Alaness saved his life by sacrificing my own during the invasion of Marduum. Since that he became one of his most trusted adviser.

“What information have you collected ? “  
 “Dire news my lord.”   
 *Just what I was afraid of.*   
 *“*N’Zoth has escaped from his prison. A joint effort between the Alliance and Horde or more precisely between Lor’themar Theron and Jaina Proudmoore. They were accompanied by some of the champions of those who fought with us against the Legion. They defeated Azshara in her palace which helped N’Zoth to escape.”

“We have to protect Azeroth no matter what” Alaness proclaimed.   
 “We are trying to figure out a way to minimise the effects of his corrupting powers.  
 “There might be someone out there who can help. I ran into a name over and over again.” The words of Sevis surprised Alaness. There wasn’t a single being who could offer any help until this point. They tried to contact with the Void Elves but their knowledge was limited in negating such powers.  
 “Who?” Alaness asked.

“Wrathion, The Black Prince.”

­­\*\*\*

On the peaks of Mount Neverest a Monk was meditating.   
 His name was Jinhao.  
 He was one of the Monks who joined to the Horde from the Wandering Isle. He took part in the Pandaren Campaign. He have fought against all the Seven Sha, earned the trust of the Black Prince. During the invasion of the Burning Legion he was in the front lines. He worked together with the greatest champions of Azeroth and he became one of the most promising Monk under the leadership of the new Grandmaster of the Broken Temple.   
 His time on the battlefield however scared him. He fought against the invaders of Zuldazar. After Lady Jaina managed to escape he helped the citizens to quell the emotions.   
 But after a long time he felt desperation and anger. He knew that Sylvanas wanted to make sure the Horde will prosper under her leadership but as the time passed she started to show similarities with the late warchief, Garrosh Hellscream.  The burning of Teldrassil was just as cruel as the destruction of Theramore.   
 *I have to make sure I do the right thing if I stay with the Horde like my friends.*  
 He was on Pandaria for a month already. He trained every day, visited farmlands and honoured his hobbies. Reading, fishing and cooking. He was a curious Pandaren. The more he known about the history of the world and It’s inhabitants, the more he could use to develop his skills and style.   
 The Lorewalkers allowed him to read every book he could find, Cho helped him to explore the deepest secrets of Pandaria.    
 After 2 weeks of excessive trainings, meditation and learning however nightmares started to haunt him whenever closed his eyes. To end it he asked Lorewalker Cho to brew him a potion to explore his dreams.  
 He was accompanied by Cho and Scrollmaker Resshi at the Whitepetal Lake along with his Cloud Serpent, Sol Yun.  
 The Vale has recovered from Its Sha infested state, which was caused by the actions of Garrosh.  
 The wonders of the Vale always made Jinhao feel relieved.  
 “Drink this Jinhao and try to rest.” Asked Resshi.   
 “Your nightmeres are far from natural dreams. The Waterspeakers are afraid of a darkness that will consume this world. Perhaps your dreams can uncover some of the mysteries if we are able to discover something.”  
 As Jinhao drank the potion he snapped into dreaming in seconds.  
 *I tought I will be dreaming but I’m still awake.*   
 “This potion isn’t working my friends so let’s try soemth….”  
 At the moment he turned to the Lorewalkers he found no one. He was alone.  
 He heard something from behind him. When he turned he had been hit by a colossal tentacle so with such power that he landed in the lake. He needed ten seconds to reach the water surface.  
 What he had seen was much more horrific than anything he had ever faced before.  
 Facless beings roamed in the wale. Strange buildings flew in the skies.   
 “Everything is so dark. The sha infestation was nothing compared to this.” He thought.  
 “I have to wake up somehow.”  
 “**YOU WILL NOT LEAVE**” Said a strange voice.   
 Jinhao heard it from everywhere at the same time.  
 A Faceless appeared before him. After a moment it transformed into his dark image. Tentacles grew from his back only to attack the Monk.   
 The reflexes of Jinhao allowed him to dodge and react to every tentacle strike, every kick and hit the copy tried to land on him.   
 He tried to counterattack but one thing was missing. He could not use his Chi.  
 “What have you done to me?”  
 The shadow Pandaren laughed.   
 “Your biggest fear allowed me to exist. Your darkness is my existence” He said.  
 Jinhao took up a defensive stance. He had to wait for a moment to strike back. Adapting to his opponent moves was a strategy he usually utilized with his weapons on hand. He had no weapons made of steel. His body was a weapon. He had to use everything he learnt over the years as he felt it’s not just his Chi was vanished. He himself was fading as the time goes on.   
 “I will not give up” He yelled.   
 At that moment he grabbed a tentacle only to pull the shadow closer to him. But at the moment he was close enough to perform a fatal blow a dark explosion knocked Jinhao away.  
 “You can’t defeat us, pandaren” The voice came from not one but three shadow.  
 “Impossible.” Jinhao was in an impossible situation. Anger started to conquer the monk as he tried to land more and more strike. The shadows however not just dodged everything easily but landed twice as much strike on him as could hope to cause to his enemies.  
 *No. I will not be able to beat them. Those techniques and movements were mine. How can I defeat myself?* The answer came as fast as he realised they are not his foes. It’s his own Chi he was fighting against.   
 He charged against the shadows. At the last moment he stopped before them and closed his eyes.  
 He tried to calm himself down. Every loss he experienced over the past months and every atrocities he had to commit during the past months slowly scared his soul and his trust in the Horde, but most importantly in himself.   
 “Do not let your judgement be clouded in trying times” The words of the jade Serpent echoed in his mind. A lesson he learned a long time ago.   
 *I believed them to be my enemies but they are me. I can become my own enemy if I let the darkness and corruption swallow me.*  
 “No! I will not be defeated by these mindgames!”  
 As he closed his eyes the body started to emit greenish yellow light after he realised what is going on, the shadows started to fade.  
 When he opened his eyes he found the Lorewalkers.  
 “What have you learnt my friend” Asked Cho.  
 “The Vale will succumb to the powers of darkness, to the powers of an Old God.”   
 The news shocked the Lorewalkers. Pandaria barely healed from the.  
 None of them could speak for moments.   
 Jinhao tried to figure out what to do. He had seen no option to prevent this horror to come to life.   
 “Wrathion” Cho said.   
 “Weeks ago he visited us. We share knowledge and experience which comes from the legends and witnessing the capabilities of the dark forces the Sha possessed.”  
 “I could share everything I know about the Black Empire of old times, but I assume we do not possess that much time.”  
 “Where can I find him?” Jinhao asked.   
 “We bid farewell to each other eleven days ago. He told me that he will visit the Shado-Pan Monastery. Their experience in combating the forces of the Old Gods can be valuable.”  
 Jinhao did not hesitate. He jumped on the back of Sol Yun and headed to the monastery.  
 “I’m sorry but I have to find him as fast as I can” He shouted back to the Lorewalkers.

fm0oh0,filben,Main story/main quests in WoW? (Newcomer question),"I'm currently in MMO mood and also playing ESO at the moment. I played WoW back in 2004 but only for a month and now I reactivated my account and wanted to play with my buddies. I'm a bit lost, though.

In ESO you can practically pick your zone and start the zone's story line through the interface, which gives you the first quest giver and the start of a series of main quests with an overarching conflict in that zone (and of course your usual MMO activities and content and farming).

Is there something like this in WoW? I started at Northshire, had to help with enemy scouts and a possible attack, was then sent to Goldshire and then to Stormfall but I just brought items from one NPC to another. I remember Westfall from 2004, which I really loved, so I headed there but there was no quest there for me to pick up (at least somewhere in the very north east).

I have absolutely no clue about the Warcraft universe, but I thought there would be a conflict between Alliance and Horde, and conflicts within each faction? So maybe I've missed something. Where does a zone quest line or quest strands start?

fm0b7d,AzevaraDuskbeam,BFA Mage Retrospective,"Hey all, I made this post originally on the official forums ( [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bfa-mage-retrospective/472479](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bfa-mage-retrospective/472479) ) but I'm not sure where most people are hanging out these days. Would really appreciate getting to hear folks outside the class discord bubble share their thoughts and opinions about Mage this expac, whether you agree/disagree or felt that something was left out.  


Full post: 

While this is certainly personal opinion, a lot of these thoughts have been collected and filtered through observation and interaction with the Mage community as a Contributor for Altered Time, as well as through individual and group theorycrafting discussions for Simulationcraft work. Big thanks to Kuni, Zulandia, Norrinir, Malon, Toegrinder, Frosted, Dorovon, Komma, Preheat, Sergrand, and probably several other notable Mages I forgot to write down in this list (I’m sorry!) for their help in organizing and refining this.

**Overview**

Mage in BFA saw some drastic swings from start to finish that really highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the class. While some of it comes down to raid fight design, the overall mood that prevailed for a large part of BFA was “I’m here for the int buff”. Two major reasons contribute to these feelings:

**1.** All three Mage specs are primarily focused on single target with the potential for stacked passive cleave. This has historically been the point of Mage, and is an iconic core part of the class feel. Unfortunately, it has not always been the case that Mage specs have been able to excel at this role compared to other ranged classes, who performed just as well in this area and then were able to be further amplified when their niches presented themselves. This leaves Mage players feeling, bluntly, like other classes are simply “better” with little to no tradeoff.

**2.** Mage has a large amount of *personal* utility (in PvE). This is also deeply tied into the class feel, where spells like Blink, Ice Block, and Barriers form a useful bag of tricks that skilled Mages can call upon to keep themselves alive and maximize their time spent casting. The downside to this, however, is that Mages rarely can contribute to group utility, outside of using the immunity of Ice Block (which, since Tomb of Sargeras, seems to be something the encounter team has tried to avoid creating too many uses for). This becomes even more evident in dungeons, where the long cooldown on Counterspell, the restriction of Dragon’s Breath to a single spec, and the overall lack of generally useful situations for slows and Polymorphs (or worse, other classes having the same tools as well) become very apparent.

Together, these elements combine to leave Mages feeling like the only role they are there for is to turret into enemies. And when they don’t manage to go above and beyond classes that have additional roles in an encounter (or, as has been the case in several tiers, actually performs *worse* than others), it leads to the aforementioned malaise: “I’m the only Mage in here, and it’s just for Arcane Intellect”.

Below are some comments on individual specs.

**Frost**

Frost Mages have had a weird time for most of the expansion, where one of their core abilities (Ice Lance) was actually able to be removed from the rotation entirely and used only when nothing else could be cast while moving. Feelings on this are fairly mixed, but most agree that it seems unintuitive at a glance, and it additionally has the effect of removing part of the most iconic piece of the Frost rotation, “Shatter” combos. The Azerite trait Flash Freeze is a big culprit here, but the underlying cause is rooted in the design of Mastery and how it affects Frostbolt/Flurry (as it stands right now, it is possible to gain DPS by avoiding Ice Lance just by having enough Mastery, before talents or traits are even considered).

On the flip side, Azerite has led to the most unique situation among Mage specs, where another set of talents and traits allows for a very different, Ice Lance-focused build in combination with Frozen Orb. Personal opinions on which build is preferred vary greatly, but it cannot be understated how much players seem to enjoy having another competitive option if they happen to dislike one setup but still want to play Frost.

Compared to other Mage specs, Frost is the most stable in terms of damage output. While the reliability itself doesn’t feel bad, it has become increasingly apparent that the lack of any “burst” windows for the spec ends up as an overall detriment. When balanced to be about even in average performance, Fire and Arcane’s ability to rapidly dump damage at specific times offers them more flexibility, usually leaving Frost performing worse in real encounters. Additionally, Frost and Fire both compete on the niche of stacked cleave, but Frost is significantly more limited in target count while lacking the option to burst down a group.

**Fire**

Fire had a very underdog story throughout BFA, coming from a last place, niche execute-phase pick up to the most desired ranged spec overall. Despite the common myth, this has nothing to do with Fire “scaling well at the end of the expansion” (which wasn’t ever true) but rather is the result of a combination of very powerful items and effects that weren’t present at launch of BFA. This leaves Fire in a tenuous position moving into Shadowlands, as the loss of Hyperthread Wristwraps, Memory of Lucid Dreams, Blaster Master, and even Azshara’s Font of Power will significantly weaken most of the current strengths of the spec.

Speaking of those strengths, Fire has several very desirable ones. The first is Ignite, which when amplified by all the aforementioned effects, turns Fire Mages into an absolute monster for those 10-15 seconds of cooldown use. The high APM gameplay and free, passive, bursty cleave of Combustion is typically one of the biggest draws to the spec. Even on a single target, Combustion is a powerful window that typically feels good to play now, when every cast is instant. To many players, Fire just *feels* good and fluid at all points, but especially when popping everything. Additionally, Fire’s nearly full mobility during Combustion and (if talented) below 30% boss HP made playing Fire in hectic final boss phases feel strong and versatile this expansion.

Not much is said about the other 90+ seconds in between Combustions, and for good reason: while it’s not jarring to play by any means, the “regular” Fire rotation is fairly simple and also very weak. Some people don’t mind this, but it definitely is one of the worst-feeling aspects of the spec. Also tied into this problem is the lack of good AoE damage during this downtime. Flamestrike has a number of issues, the most significant of which might be that casting it can actually lose Ignite damage. Additionally, when talented into Flame Patch, the best behavior is simply to hardcast Flamestrike as much as possible, instead of doing a more normal rotation and spending Hot Streaks on it. This counterintuitive behavior for class mechanics is a running theme for Fire. The fact that Crit is not a necessary stat to play the spec, or that Ignite can require you to AFK to kill short-lived targets effectively\*, or even the previously mentioned myth about scaling during an expansion are all misunderstandings that frequently muddy the waters for players.These issues aside, Fire covers a lot of roles and does them well, so barring significant imbalance it often ends up outshining the other two Mage specs, without turning a large number of people away. The biggest worry moving forward is that this enjoyment is temporary due to the upcoming loss of many expansion-specific items and powers.

\*Clarification on this point: On targets that will die before a full Ignite would expire, refreshing the Ignite will redistribute the remaining damage out over a full duration, reducing the DPS it deals and losing any damage stored in Ignite when the target dies. Ex: 3 ticks of 80k vs 10 ticks of 24k, where the target dies after 5 seconds.

**Arcane**

Arcane had a rough time in BFA. There’s no other way to really put it, most of the systems and items added to the game did not benefit the spec as much as they did Fire or Frost, and it is very much pigeonholed into either a single target build for raid or an AoE build for dungeons, with little cross-over in terms of Azerite itemisation or talents. Multiple times the spec has needed buffs simply to keep up with the power creep Frost and Fire received, and even then real raid encounters often sidelined a spec that can *only* do single target damage. The introduction of Equipoise moved Arcane to an even stricter burn/conserve cycle, limiting the ability to adapt or focus a target if things didn’t happen to line up just perfectly with cooldown timings. The increasingly long setup of buff-related GCDs before moving into the often-memed “single-button spec” rotation turns many curious Mages away, even when the spec might be able to compete.

There probably isn’t a single cure-all solution to what Arcane needs, and player commentaries on it run the whole gamut from wanting old abilities back or useful (Arcane Orb, Nether Tempest, Quickening) to more extreme ideas like shifting the spec to healing or tanking. Dedicated Arcane players seem to mostly stick with it for the pure purple magic identity or the fundamental concept of being a sorcerer. On a practical level, one of the biggest gripes is usually how boss and trash toolkits are completely different, yet Mythic Plus requires both in equal measure. This difference is extreme when compared to other classes, and makes Arcane feel like a hindrance in at least one role no matter what they choose.

The last and thorniest issue for Arcane is that of Mana. As mentioned above, Equipoise threw the spec into very strict percentage-based gameplay; but even before the introduction of the trait, the issues were clear. With how Arcane Charges work, it is mathematically unstable\* for the spec to be flexible with its mana spending, and this is what typically creates the burn/conserve cycle that locks Arcane into its current playstyle. Most of the bad feelings about Arcane can point to this as their source. Arcane Blast spamming doesn’t feel good when you do it in both burn *and* conserve. Arcane Barrage is the only way to take a few steps while casting, but also resets your Charges. Arcane Missiles are no longer tied to Charges, so you are free to use them without worry; but since they no longer stack you must use them immediately, which means you cannot save them for utilizing Slipstream. In AoE situations, Arcane Charges behave just like Combo Points to be spent on Barrage. Some of these comments are fresh to BFA compared to Legion’s design, but those that aren’t highlight the underlying feeling of Arcane players: the spec doesn’t have enough variety, and the spells it does use are frequently overloaded with conflicting roles.

\*If dumping charges (by casting Arcane Barrage etc) is high dps, the rotation will gravitate to trying to dump as often as possible. Conversely, if spamming spells at high charges is high dps, the rotation will attempt to maximize the amount of time spent in this state. Any equilibrium in between the two that allows for tradeoffs like choosing when to burn mana etc. is inherently unstable, and a slight tip in the balance one way or the other will drive the optimal rotation towards one of the two extremes.",37,1584729912,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fm0b7d/bfa_mage_retrospective/,wow,1

fltigh,dennisdeboer,A small leveling guide made by an altoholic. (Horde),"I made this leveling guide for a guildie of mine, but why not share it here? So here you go.  


Welcome to Zoe's leveling guide.  From 1-64 you want to do Durotar, Stonetalon, Northern Barrens  
and Winterspring with dungeons mixed in. (And bgs if you're into pvp. Note: pvp sucks at level 20-29 because of twinks.)

Once you're level 64, you can choose to go to Northrend and do Borean Tundra and Dragonblight... or you can turn on party sync and go through the zones from 1-64 again. To turn on party sync, you could ask a friend who's still in that leveling range. You could also get a second pc/laptop and make a bnet account to have a starter edition account for party sync. (You could also do /who in for example northern barrens and whisper a random person to see if you can make a party with them.) If you do Northrend, queue for either TBC or Wrath dungeons, both are fine. If you party synced, ask the person if they want to do dungeons. Who doesn't love Deadmines at level 74?

At 80, you could continue with party sync leveling (zones like Hillsbrad are also great) or you could go to Pandaria. For Pandaria I would recommend Jade Forest and any other zone. (except for Townlong Steppes.)

Once you're 90, stop party sync IMMEDIATELY. Use the Gorgrond skip in timeless isle and fly to your garrison to build it. Pick up the treasures in Frostfire along the way. If you do not have flying, I would recommend doing the intro to Draenor. Complete the first set of quests in your garrison up until the quest where you need to go to Wor'gol. Start doing all the bonus objectives in Frostfire and collect the treasure. You should hit level 92 or 93. (Once you hit 91, buy an xp potion from your garrison quatermaster.) Go to Gorgrond right now. Gorgrond is the best leveling zone in wow currently. For some reason, most quests give double the xp. Start questing, collect treasure and do bonus objectives. For your Gorgrond garrison, pick the shredder. Both are good, but the shredder is better. You can easily hit level 100 in Gorgrond alone. Right before you hit level 100, go to your garrison and use another xp potion. You can't use them at level 100, but they continue working if you drink them before hitting 100. Once you are 100, do bonues objectives and treasures in Talador and Nagrand. You will hit something between level 102 and 104. (You can guarantee level 104 by also doing Spires of Arak, but the bonus objectives in Spires of Arak FUCKING SUCK.)

Once you're done with Draenor, go to the Broken Isles and get your artifact weapon/unlock your order hall. You can now choose to level with party sync or do legion stuff. Do legion invasions whenever they're up. (Do legion invasions until you hit 111) Fun fact: the chests that spawn in the underbelly give you about half a quest worth of xp.

The same applies to BfA. Get your neck, go to Zandalar. You can now choose to do three things. You can level through party sync, regular questing and leveling through island expeditions. Party sync is the same as in the 64-80 bracket. I would recommend doing faction incursions if you choose for regular BfA leveling, since a 10% xp buff is nice. I'm not going to explain island expedition leveling.",30,1584703940,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fltigh/a_small_leveling_guide_made_by_an_altoholic_horde/,wow,1

flqq33,Accer_sc2,You stop collecting Echoes once you have no rank 3's available. Word of warning.,"I recently switched my focus from my main to my alt. I had started the essence grind long before the new catch up mechanic was announced, but was happy to see that it would make my last few essences easier to get.

My main didn't have many essences because I stopped playing shortly after their release, but I do have revered with mechagon and nazjatar on him because I unlocked flying before my break.

I've been working on those two rank 3 essences and am now just waiting to grind out the currency needed to buy the rank 3 mechagon one (on my main).

Here's where I fucked up.

My alt actually had more essences than my main, but almost no reputations. I've been logging on my alt anyway to try and collect echoes, and was doing so successfully until today.

I had come close to unlocking the nazjatar essence before the echoes came out so I decided to just grind out the last few days of dailies while I collected my echoes from 8.3 stuff.

Then, to save my essences I went and bought rank 3 today. It turns out that it was my last ""purchasable"" essence and now I can't collect echoes anymore. I did 2 invasions and the daily vision... and got 0 echoes.. because the game thinks I have nothing left to grind for.

If I had not purchased the nazjatar essence I could have continued collecting echoes.. which seems kind of backwards to me.

Is there really any reasons why we shouldn't be able to bank them?

As of right now I have no reason to play my alt until I am done grinding out the 20 boxes of spare crates on my ""main"" (who I ultimately want to retire since I don't enjoy playing it).

TLDR: leave at least one unlockable essence on your alts so you can bank up echoes.",35,1584688409,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/flqq33/you_stop_collecting_echoes_once_you_have_no_rank/,wow,1

Anyone start WoW recently?  Was it fun?  Easy to pick up?  Shitty because 99% of the people around you will have been playing for years, regardless of what their current level is?

It just seems to me like the current leveling process just wouldn't be that fun, given how much it's been 'sped up' in the last decade... well, it seems like WoW is always geared towards ""hurry up to end game"" with little thought to the journey.

fllnbf,Markula_4040,"Retail: Questions about addons, buying expansions, choosing class, graphics, and misc. from a returning player.","Thinking pretty hard about getting back into WoW and stuck on some last things that may help decide so I'd like to hear what people think:

**1.** Addons - I have no interest in smothering my screen with them nor do I want to put playing on auto-pilot by using macros or addons that tell me what and when to do things. Do I need to expect to be ostracized from group content, especially endgame, if I play without all of the bells and whistles most people use?

**2.** Expansions - I left off at the Legion expansion but I probably would start a new character. If that's the case, are there really any benefits to me getting BFA and Shadowlands right now? I was looking to get the bundle so I get two months of play while being caught up expansion-wise. I know I won't be accessing BFA content for a good minute. Thought there may be some benefits early on though even when starting from level 1.

**3.** Class - Not asking to pick my class. I would like some more info if possible though. Can we see how much of what class is on a server to find most/least played? Unless it's known what they are generally then what are they? I like having an idea of what may be needed or not when picking.

**4.** Graphics - Are there any tweaks, addons, SweetFX, etc. that can be used to make the game's graphics look nicer/pop more? I'm a big graphics whore and love to see abilities and character look their best. I know games like ESO can be greatly enhanced by outside things so wondering if WoW can do the same.

**Misc** - 

Can we play DKs and DHs at level 1 yet or that's not until Shadowlands?

Are all of the servers generally leaning towards one faction or is there a decently populated one with a good balance?

How are RP servers for those not interested in actually RPing? I heard they can be the most fun and laid-back but I'm not sure if that applies to those who aren't participating in that way. Wouldn't want to join a server and be shitting on other's parade when I can go elsewhere.

Right now you can not see whether a stun is physical or magical and the knowledge comes from trial and error. 
It isnt a huge problem for a large player base because mostly this knowledge is needed for pvp players. 


**As an example:** Kidney Shot is a *physical stun* and can be evaded by Evasion(100%) or Blur (50% chance) while Chaos Nova or Hammer of Justice are *magical stuns* that can be ""evaded"" by spells that grant you magic immunity (Cloak of Shadows or Anit-Magic Shell).",4,1584661434,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/flkhv0/introduce_magical_stun_physical_stun_to/,wow,0

flil9j,Sparda81989,A Paladin on US-Lightbringer looking for advice.,"Some background first: I've been playing WoW on and off since BC, and I'm a bit of an altaholic. I enjoy playing my paladin, but there are a lot of variables now to take into consideration that wasn't there when I was playing during my hardcore time in WotLK. I also have a bit of social anxiety and I'm dreadfully fearful of being the weak link in a group.

I've got my paladin geared to 427 ilvl, and I've been mainly retribution, but I want to tank and heal as well, especially with time walking going on. I don't have a lot of essences, what I have is low ranked, and I don't have azerite armor with the correct traits. What can I do to get over this hump and what resources are out there for someone who wants to do more than world quests, fish, and spend gold trying in vain to make enough for a token.

Oh, also no flying. Working in it though! Also, if there are people that play on my server that have an active guild, I'd be interested.

I know this post might seem like I'm asking for a lot, and I apologize in advance. I'm just trying to get back into the swing of things, since I've got a whole lot more time on my hands now.

flhem3,Hydrahaze,I'm curious about the direction of World of Warcraft.,"Which path are we actually taking with this game? As i’m more and more overwhelmed, confused and disappointed every new expansion and/or patch. It blows my mind that after all these years playing a game which was my favorite game of all time, turned into dogshit.

Lets start with Titanforging as an example as how Blizzard nowadays addresses feedback from the community. Titanforging is removed. What do you get in return? **Corruption.** At this stage it just freaks me out…**You remove something to add an even worse system in return which is another complicated let down garbage system which nobody litterly asked for to introduce as an return**. Why does this RNG continously have to be shoved down players their throat?

**Let me make this clear as me, as an player.**

These game mechanics **will not “extend” my playtime** in any way of form as i am sick of this slot machine that i have to play everyday for the right piece with the right stats and the right corruption. This whole casino journey is sucking the fun out of the game **real quick**. Effort or time investment means nothing anymore. It all depends on your RNG and **IF** you finally manage to get the right piece with the right stats you will be greeted with **another RNG on top of that** such as Corruption/Titanforging/Warforging etc. I will not be playing **“more” or “extend”** my subscription just because you add time gated content such as **“pathfinder”** in order to make me fly which i used to just pay gold for anyway. This type of content just doens’t do it for me. It’s plain, boring and repetitive and honestly feels not even rewarding enough, as some of these new changes are things that were effortless to acces in the earlier days of World of Warcraft like, flying. It makes no sense. It seems like Blizzard is so out of touch that they don’t know what content to introduce so we are just travelling all over the map to do all these silly things which will be worthless in the next expansion as usual.

**What do keeps me playing** is grinding mythics, doing the raid, and/or doing pvp as it can be fun or exciting due to the challenges. \*\*Going to a zone a million times and doing the same chore that has zero difficulty, doesn’t. \*\*Desperately wanting to play a race that is locked behind another rep farm that you will need to do first in order to play the race **you actually wanted to play in the first place** is another example of that. (which for new players means even worse)   
I am honestly amazed that this is the way Blizzard seem to think to keep players engaged and entertained longterm as it’s actually working the opposite way, atleast for me.  
Content gets added, removed, added again **(different name but same concept)** then another system gets added, removed, added again and when something is actually fun, it is being **removed from the game**.  
Abilities, Talents and Classes just in a whole are totally the same as every class has a teleport, speed boost or whatsoever. Pruning these classes made not only lose **class specific abilities** but also made combining certain talents from different trees impossible. \*\*Class identity in general is just dead.  
\*\*Professions? Same thing. Most of the crafting professions are simply **useless.** The main problem with professions today is that the items required to make good gear, **is locked behind grinding raids for X weeks.** This means that the consequences of this whole system is that you already acquired better gear from the raids before you acquired all the necessary mats to actually craft a piece of gear **which is now below your current ilvl.** This means that crafting at that point becomes obsolete as the gear you’ll gain from it is worse then what you are currently wearing.  
You have \*\*\*\*ed up when your crafting progression system feels like utter garbage to even invest in.

Player Versus Player is basically the same stuff.Players who tend to only play this game for the purpose of doing PvP only are having a hard time these last expansions and i can only imagine they are long gone by now. With all these changes the past years for no reason these players are as usually **ignored**. What happened to PvP gear? The PvP vendors? What is the reason behind the idea that players who wants to participate in PvP are forced to be doing PvE first in order to actually gear for the proper content the player is striving for? These players now have to PUG or join a PvE raiding guild and be on raid schedules and do M+ during the week in the meantime\*\*.\*\* Why? Why being so ignorant and complicated if all you need to do is supply the demand. **The demand is what used to exist in the first place**. Players progressing through Battlegrounds/Arenas in order to properly gear their characters, just as PvE players farm raids to properly progress and gear their characters. These changes are the best example about it. These things were in the game and they are all **removed from the game** for whatever reason. Blizzard apparenly feels like this is the way to handle engaging content for these players while in reality, they are all leaving as they are forced to do other content instead. I haven’t even discussed the current WQ’s, Visions, Daily Rep Grinds, Essences, AP etc as the story explains itself, it’s time consuming and not the focus these players have.

The last few expansions in my opinion just feel like i’m playing what Blizzard wants me to play instead of what **I** actually want to play.  
The community has no say in anything which is the opposite of what it used to be. We are in Battle for Azeroth taking a direction were suddenly Alliance and Horde hug trees together and only boomers still log-on for their daily time gated rep grind and take a selfie to end the evening. World of Warcraft? I don’t see any war besides the community against Blizzard or should i have said Activision all along?

flgfll,Backwardspellcaster,Easiest class to do Horrific Visions 5 Mask runs with?,"Hey :)

So, I have a 455 Paladin, with which I can do 3 Masks runs at this point. I succeeded as both Ret as well as Prot, but I feel like it is extremely difficult as melee.

Mistakes seem to be punished very hard. For example in Old Town there is a mini-boss which does a massive beam or a powerful AOE. Being caught first in Split Personality, with halfway through getting also Haunting Shadows pretty much takes at least half of your Sanity away, and that tends to also spawn an Enemy of the Void.

So, it's extremely punishing and also seriously luck dependant. 

Alleria at the end was a serious nightmare. Between her constant AOE casts, and the eye floating around, and half of the area on fire or with black circles, I think I spent like 80% of the time just running and hiding and dodging instead of fighting, and I lost a full charge of sanity and needed a respawn to defeat her at the end.

**So I also have a Hunter, a Warlock and a DH at level 120.**

I am considering taking one of these alts and gearing them up.

Which one would be easiest to do the 5 Mask run with? I feel like having a pet tank will really help.

On the other hand a DH seems to just melt everything.

Open to suggestions.

flfey4,Magners17,Obtaining flying as a new player is painful.,"For the record, I’m not a new player to the game but I am a new player to BFA. I stopped playing WoW a few months before BFA was released. Legion was fun, MoP was my favorite, yadda yadda. I’ve played the game since Vanilla. 

When I came back it was fun to level again. The system seems pretty cool, you can cruise through content and play any zone. Loved that part of it. I was able to buy flying on the new server I was on after saving up enough gold. I had unlocked all previous Pathfinder achievements so I could fly in all expansions until BFA. 

BFA levelling was cool, the zones were awesome. As I cruises through 110-120 I would admire the scenery and thought “I can’t wait to fly up to that mountain and see the view”. I was genuinely stoked on being able to take off with my flying mount from the Great Seal and zoom across the continent. 

Upon reaching 120 I made it my goal to try and obtain flying first and foremost. I’ve dabbled a bit into island expeditions and a bit of PvP, some LFR but only the newest raid. Otherwise I was focusing on finishing each zone, exploring them and begin rep grinding. I didn’t think it would take this long....

I honestly thought that I could just plug away at the rep grind and solely focus on that to get my flying. I went off and completed breadcrumb quests that I checked before on wowhead to make sure I would get rep for them. I made sure to complete emissaries. Focussed hard in Tortollan Speakers as I heard that was the toughest. I’m almost revered with everyone needed for Pathfinder Part one and I have 2 days and 11 hours played time at level 120. I’ve taken breaks from rep grinding and got my cloak and some HoA essences of course but man I figured I’d be closer to unlocking flying by now. 

Now I’m about to start the painful grind of Rustbolt Resistance and The Unshackled which I’ve put off to focus on Part one. RR will take me weeks alone as I’m not even honoured yet. As far as I know, even with fishing and killing rares and doing dailies, I’m gated to maybe 1500 rep a day with them and that’s if I grind it hard. 

My feedback I suppose is this: let me grind out rep if that’s what I choose to do. I know I can do missions and dailies and get contracts but as soon as I’ve done my days worth of grinding...I’m stuck. I can no longer obtain more rep for that faction until the next day. Let me grind out mobs for 1-5 rep a piece or something. Give me some way to focus on doing exactly what I want to do especially if it’s something as essential as flying. The Xpac has been out for forever and starting from square one with legendary cloak quest lines, essence gathering, Nazjatar and Mechagon as well as grinding rep for flying is absolutely painful.

I understand timegating certain aspects of the game but being able to explore the beautifully created World of Warcraft from the top of a majestic flying creature shouldn’t take this long.",25,1584643983,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/flfey4/obtaining_flying_as_a_new_player_is_painful/,wow,0

I’m genuinely curious as to why.  I personally used to do LFR back in Uldir because I just started playing the game and that seemed like the natural stepping stone to get into raiding.  Everyone I talked to would say “Go into LFR and learn the fights.”  I quickly realized that it was easier wiping on the difficulty I was doing than to spend almost an entire night trying to figure out what was going on.  I know a lot of people on this sub play this game casually, and that is fine.  More merit to you.  My question is, is there a better way to do this? Surely someo of you have had horror stories.  Do you think there is a way to have a tourist mode, or is it better to force people into doing some sort of group coordination, even if that means pushing players away from “seeing the story”

flel3f,iam1in1,The time I befriended Chinese gold sellers: and aided their cause.,"So I did a pretty unconventional thing back in the 2011-2012 World of Warcraft days. I can't tell you why I did it, maybe boredom or general curiosity? Anywhoo, here's my story. 

It begins in the orc starting zone, Durotar with the item vial of sands, a 2 seater flying mount. It transforms the player into a sandstone Drake allowing another player to mount for easy transportation (Y'all know the one). If I remember right, I had just gotten the vial of sands, which costed alotta cheese back then! So naturally I was chilling in the orc starting zone ready to flex on these lows. 

So there I am chasing around fresh level 1's flexing my massive sandstone Drake epeen when I began noticing something peculiar. Many of these level 1's spawning in were running to Orgrimmar. Gold spammers I thought to myself. I seized upon my newly acquired ability of transportation and began acting as a taxi for these fine fellows from Durotar to Orgrimmar (with the help of Google translate). ""Ni shi zhong guo Ren?"" I would say, which I guess is: ""You are Chinese?"" Followed by an invite, they'd stop and reply then I'd fly them off to Orgrimmar to spam the masses their gold selling site. 

It was a new perspective entirely. Before I was on the outside looking in. These guys were annoying spamming keylogging bastards. And admittedly, I had only began to taxi to Orgrimmar after dropping the first few passengers In fatigue riddled seas. But talking with them I found out they're not just account hacking monsters. They were normal working people who are very courteous, kind, health conscious and apt to teach. I even made a friend, her name was Sophy from GDPGold who gave me 5 or 6 throw away accounts that I used to scam thousands of gold. All in all, it was a great long weird ride filled with hilarity. Did anyone else have any out of norm experiences like this?

flcwyi,Ashtar17,How to make raiding capital cities worthwhile again.,"TLDR; Have seasonal achievements/quests where you need to kill each leader of the opposing faction *AND* kill 250 enemy players while within one of your own faction's capital cities.  Completion of the achievement awards a Vicious Saddle to be used to purchase an elite mount of your choosing from the PVP mount vendor.

\---

Back in Wrath, raiding capital cities was considered a worthwhile thing to do because if you killed all of the opposing faction's leaders, you got a bear mount.

No power increase. Just a pretty cool looking/unique mount (for the time).  Whether you were interested in raiding cities or not, this made the experience worthwhile and made the world feel alive at times.

Now a days, there isn't much reason to attack a capital city.  There is close to zero rewards for doing so.

Enter my idea; Seasonal achievements/quests that award vicious saddles upon completion.

At the start of every season, there should be quests and/or achievements made available that require you to do two things with Warmode On:

1. Kill all of the opposing factions leaders within their home, capital city.
2. Defend your own faction's capital cities by slaying 250 players of the opposing faction. (This would be to encourage defending of your own cities, rather than just simply attacking the other faction's cities).

If/when you complete this, you will rewarded with a Vicious Saddle.  If you are not familiar with Vicious Saddles, they are used to purchase elite mounts from past PVP seasons.  Many of these mounts look amazing!  However, if this vicious saddle isn't rewarding enough, large amounts of Marks of Honor, honor points can be thrown in as well.

This achievement/quest would reset at the beginning of each season, allowing you to repeat it once every season for a new vicious mount to acquire.",13,1584635391,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/flcwyi/how_to_make_raiding_capital_cities_worthwhile/,wow,1

flba5p,kneelbefore,So my girlfriend had a very interesting conversation with a game master today..," During the raid she dropped a BoE item from trash, but was not able to loot it (prob due to a bug bec her bags were not full), she didn't try to loot it again we thought it will come to the mailbox anyway since for the next boss she was benched and she had to leave the raid.

 She contacted customer support via live chat about it, apparently there was a change in the system and BoE items that are not looted are not seen in the logs. (in this case the BoE she could not loot) Game master was not aware of this change and he accused her with scamming. After her tries to connect another GM she came across the same one again. But this time the game master said ''sorry'' i did not know the system was changed and adviced her to ''find'' the reason why she could not loot the item so it won't happen again.

 To summarize it my gf was accused with scam by a game master because he was ignorant about the changes, and also was told to find the reason of the bug and they did nothing about her losing the item aswell just an example of how well blizzard customer support works.",16,1584629561,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/flba5p/so_my_girlfriend_had_a_very_interesting/,wow,1

1) Most of them are timegated behind specific minor assaults and thus up 3 days out of every 14.
2) They're on a daily loot lockout unlike Timeless Isle.
3) They have a long respawn timer.
4) The drop rates are pitiful.
5) They have no spawn protection and go down to groups in seconds.
6) All the while, they're surrounded by ample ""rare"" mobs that literally drop nothing but azerite and exist solely for the sake of quest credit. No shared drops.",114,1584627297,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/flap52/vale_and_uldum_rares_are_a_remarkably_obnoxious/,wow,1

He wants to Finnish a quest, but it seems like whatever he does it just doesn't complete, it is the quest: ""protecting the shipment"" (and yes, he has abandoned it and replayed it many times) is it a glitch we though.

Then he remembered that he hasn't bought the game, and he is lv19 and almost lvl 20, so then we thought that when he completes the quest, he would likely be lv20, and since lv20 was the max lvl if you haven't bought the game (if I'm not mistaken) he couldn't complete the quest until he has bought the game.

So then he bought battle for azeroth, but it seems to still not work, does he need to buy a subscription too? or what??

It just keeps saying: ""Internal Server Error: 500"", and at one point it just outright said that he can't subscribe, but it never told him why.

fl6rjy,Mosskindle,All the little things that bug me about my main,"This is ~~a rant~~ feedback. 

Fire mage has been my main since forever. Naturally, I can spend hours talking about what needs to improve and what isn't fun and whatnot... but that would be excessive. To get it out of my system, I want to list *all* the things that bother me about my main. 

Here goes, in no particular order: 

* Make Scorch do damage ffs. Doesn't even have to be respectable DPS, just don't make it *tickle* so badly.

* Slows. Fire mage needs slows. Whos genius idea was it to remove all the slows from fire? How are we supposed to kite? Frostbolt is a good start but we want Cone of Cold back. 

* Goddamn mana. DO SOMETHING WITH IT. Why is it still here? Don't wanna have the days back of drinking between each mob but for christ's sake, make it *a little* more relevant than it is right now. Not a fan of cosmetic, blue bars. 

* Skill Ceiling. Lorewise, we are the most sophisticated class. Riddle me this: Why, then, do we have such basic gameplay? (I know that this goes for most classes in BfA) If anything, mage should be among the most difficult to master classes in the game!

* PVP talents. What is this burning pile of garbage? There is *literally* one cool talent and that is Temporal Shield. What the fuck is the rest supposed to be? You give fire mage all this mobility and then you add talents that rewards standing still. One word: Greater Pyroblast. Okay, that's two, technically. Either way, screw this spell and the way it forces you to play the game. 

* Level 45 talent row. Every one of you that plays a mage knows what I mean. 

* Shimmer. Perhaps the most controversial point on my list. It's cool, it's strong, and I really dislike having to spent a talent point on it. As of right now, there isn't a respectable mage running any of the other options because it is just *that* good. Which, in turn, is bad design. Do something about it!

There, short and sweet and cathartic. Ya oughta try it. And who knows, if you write it down well enough... now is the perfect time to throw our woes at Blizz, Shadowlands alpha and all.",5,1584607474,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fl6rjy/all_the_little_things_that_bug_me_about_my_main/,wow,1

fl63d5,peachymagpie,Questing in Pandaria,"Just something I noticed.

I started to replay WoW roughly around Legion time, probably in the middle of the expansion, so I never got the chance really to go through Pandaria’s quest line. 

Today, my husband and I started the story, and I noticed that the structure of Pandaria along with the stories set up... I played from 4pm to midnight. The only other time I felt this way was through Legion and the beginning of BFA. I miss the structure of the quests, the storylines that are interconnected. It adds depth and the N’Zoth story doesn’t move as consistently. The grinds that just reward you with gold and MAYBE a drop that you already have just make me want to give up.

I would categorize myself as a lazy player that likes to perform as a pro-player xD. For that reason I would really appreciate if you can help me to choose one class considering the criterias below. 

- which class has less active spells/abilities to press?
- which class has been less impacted by the GDC?
- which class doesn’t care about the order you cast spells/abilities and just rely the most on “press this on cd no matter what”)
- finally which class has the best combination of the points above?

fl4r0t,donovan4893,Scalable Mythic after Hall of Fame completes Idea.,"I am sure many guilds feel the same as our guild, we really want to do mythic since heroic is pretty easy for us but struggle to maintain 20 people. We are not a super hardcore guild and pretty much every tier it happens we will get up to 20 do the first few bosses then lose people and then struggle to get more new people(happened again this tier).

 Our main group of people is only like 12-15 ppl and I feel like we could probably do the entire raid on mythic if we were allowed to do it with less then 20 people. 

So the idea I had was after the hall of fame is completed when mythic is opened up to cross realm also enable it to scale between 10-20 ppl. This wouldn't effect the world first race or any of the hardcore guilds as they will all have done it and be done with the tier but allows the more casual guilds to eventually take a crack at it.

fl0ksh,Stiggas,Is WoW the right game for me?,"Heyho,

So I started playing a few weeks ago and recently got to 120 on my first character. I've completed all the main stories for the horde, finished the war campaign and finished the heart of azeroth quests (not too sure though, maybe more will pop up and I just didn't notice them).
Now that I finished all of that, I started to check what stuff I could be doing. 
Professions seem to have little to no influence if you're not a hardcore raider or want to make money.
I jumped into the raid finder once, we died, both tanks pulled off a rage quit and we had to wait for an eternity to get new ones.
I participated in one Island expedition and I did not feel like it contributed to anything besides farming azerite.
I suck way too hard for pvp which I had to experience harshly^^
What I want to do is either do stuff in a group (dungeons or whatever) like a guild but in the guild finder, I texted ~15 guilds, no answer at all...
I liked the whole process of questing and only jumped into dungeons where I had quests to finish, I loved most of the zones (bfa as well as older content) and the lore was really interesting. 
So I saw these vulpera guys, thought they are cute, checked how to recruit them and I had to see that you need a lot of reputation to get them. 
Now, I'm not lazy or anything, but I feel like doing world quests for an eternity and hope, the alliance attacks this zone in combination with hoping for good companion missions that give reputation is not a good way to play the game. 
I love the small role playing aspects, but no one in the world is ever willing to just have a little chat or do stuff together. All I see are guys spamming ""hey, buy my mythic+ keys"" in the chat. Even after the raid where I felt like we accomplished something after we've failed, everyone casually left the group without a comment. 


I honestly don't know what to do. Only for unlocking the vulpera with my current reputation and missions not included, it would take me approximately 48,7 days until I've got the right amount of reputation.


Now, I don't want to flame your/our game, but I'm asking myself whether WoW is a game designed for me. If all the points listed on the top are bad things for me, do I have any other options?
Or is that simply the way the game is and it's not for me?

Would love to hear your responses.

fkzguj,CrazzluzSenpai,Help! Bought the wrong Azerite slot on Tuesday. Here's the GM's response,"This is the second response I've gotten, but the first basically says the same thing. Copy/pasted nonsense about ""if you think this policy should be changed, you need to make a post on the Suggestions forum."" Obviously that doesn't answer my issue.

&amp;#x200B;

[GM's response to my ticket](https://preview.redd.it/z14rvwztkin41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01ae78fe7f322a4691ce80f0931aa6743d0087ce)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the story: On Tuesday, after opening my Caches, I had enough Residuum to get another 475 piece of Azerite. Excited, I headed down to the vendor, grabbed my piece, and opened it. Little did I know, I accidentally clicked on Shoulders, which are the only piece of Azerite I have at 475 right now, with BiS traits, instead of Helm, which is the slot I meant to purchase. As the item was already converted into gear, I couldn't refund it. I was hoping that Blizzard would take the item from my inventory and give me back the Residuum if I put in a ticket, because I put the ticket on not 30 seconds after obtaining the item, I've never equipped it, and it still doesn't have any traits selected. It's just been sitting in my bag.

Instead, the answer I get is that if I think Azerite items should be automatically refundable I should make a post in Suggestions instead of filling out a GM ticket. Obviously I don't think all Azerite should be refundable after you activate it, but in such an obvious case of a simple mistake, I would like to think that's what the GMs are here for.

fkzdd2,freekystar,Will Blizzard ever take on Faction imbalance?,"Will Blizzard ever do something to combat faction imbalance? 

I have played this game for on-and-off for 14 years and tried out Classic for a bit when it released and the thing I really miss in Retail WoW is the feeling that both factions had a chance at being equally good at PvP/PvE. 

At it's current state it feels as if the Alliance is the leftovers of the Horde, or the Ugly Betty in class that nobody wants to do a group project with.

I'm still enjoying this game despite it's flaws but it's a shame to see this missing for several years; The supposed faction wars we've seen several times during expansions makes it feel like you have two factions at relatively equal footing but when you look aside from the storyline it's nowhere near what is portrayed.

P**vE:**

**23** Alliance guilds vs **111** Horde guilds are at 12/12M -- So basically 80% of the guilds that reach 12/12M is Horde.

**PvP:**

(Subjectively) Somewhere around **70-80%** of the Battlegrounds is a loss for Alliance.

Arena is possibly the only place Alliance can be somewhat competitive as you can weed out the bad and go with the few good players on Alliance-side.",22,1584573357,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkzdd2/will_blizzard_ever_take_on_faction_imbalance/,wow,0

fkx0dh,Chieve,Looking for help with shaman healing.,"Hello, I have been maining a shaman healer for the past two months and I have been enjoying it!

Few questions:

1. When do I lust? I never mained any class that can lust before and I always feel like an idiot. Right now I think I should always lust on boss pulls when ever it is available (with the exception of the last M+ boss, I learned I should never use lust on the 2nd to last boss and make sure it's available for the last boss).

In one dungeon, Mechagon Workshop I believe, I used it for the first boss, and I think my group wanted to save it for the 2nd?

Sometimes I wonder if it is better to save it in case of a wipe. I've been in groups that saved it for th last 30% in raids, or something along those lines.

2.  Should I DPS on trash? This is general for all healers. I am never comfortable doing dps, because when I do, I find people drop a lot of HPs and I get anxious they are gonna die. Besides riptide I don't have any instant casts and would like to save totems for a bigger emergency. On boss mechanics, DPS is fine as expecting damage is more predictable, but I can't pay attention to everything going on in trash and everything feels a bit random and I feel like I need to make sure my group do what they need as well.",4,1584564973,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkx0dh/looking_for_help_with_shaman_healing/,wow,1

fkwbin,Diovania,Blizzard should rebalance the Warmode buff on RP shards.,"It's ridiculous that Alliance on realms like Moon Guard get the 25% warmode buff, because they massively outnumber all of the other RP realms in terms of participation when it comes to warmode. Whenever I play my Horde characters on Wyrmrest Accord, there's Alliance on every corner if not gank squads. Sometimes the Horde retaliates, but it's not very often.

I'm guessing it works based on participation across NA, rather than server type. RP realms are a special case, and there's generally more Alliance than Horde.

fkv3ni,ultrascrub,So why isn't there more apprehension to the 15+ cloak +3 core system?,"From my understanding 15+ will add further corruption resistance on top of the 15 cloak by adding cores (limit 2) on top of your 15 cloak obtained through 1 full clear horrific vision and/or 1 normal+ n'zoth kill per week. The system is not implemented yet so maybe I'm just incredibly ignorant, but I can't help thinking this system sounds terrible. If it were up to me I'd just make characters gain +3 corruption resistance server wide.

Frankly I'm not all that serious in gearing an alt, but the cloak 15+ system is really unappealing to me as a whole and certainly from a catch up perspective. I don't get why they didn't just make this 15+ power gain just work server wide. I get they are willing to allow players to become really powerful at the end of the expansion, but why gate it? Isn't the power creep aimed to benefit those who cannot currently do certain high level content? 

First the catch up sources, horrific visions and raid. Personally I feel neither of these pieces of content need an additional reason for doing them. Horrific visions themselves are a massive catch up gear source, and geared characters will continue to want to do them for extra gem slots. Then we have raids in addition to being a great gearing source, they have the carapace of n'zoth and n'zoth loot that is set at a higher item level. 

Second the process to catch up an alt is already time consuming from a raw hours and raw weeks metric, even after the essence catch up addition. You have to gear/corruption, catch up on essences, level up the heart of azeroth, and level you cloak. The cloak itself would take weeks to cap 0-15 at this point. Jumping back into an alt will take more than a week or two just to cap the cloak, and then be gated again by a +1 a week catch up limit. The longer you wait to gear an alt the longer it takes to catch up, it punishes an alt a week from now more than an alt today.

Thirdly is implications of 15+ in general, a main character is going to have a larger chunk of corruption resistance, and therefore will be more powerful due to having more corrupted items equipped at no cost. This means several things could happen going into shadowlands. Corrupted gear could be cleansed or only work in bfa, diminishing value of time spent obtaining gearing rewards. Or you are going to go into shadowlands and your main is going be way more powerful and end up losing a disproportionate amount of passive power gain as new gear is collected. 

Finally, I am extremely biased because I don't enjoy the logistics of large party content, so I mostly avoid it. In order to catch up on an alt with the 15+ cloak system I have to raid weeks on end at this point, which will never happen. From a main standpoint the idea of jumping into PvP seems even more daunting, the idea of an enemy having every piece of gear corrupted seems nuts and just information overload. Personally I feel when I incrementally get more corruption effects I become incrementally less excited because it becomes increasing difficult to be aware of all the procs. I just feel the +15 system creates more work for alt as time passes, which I think is bad. The power drop off from legion to bfa has me scared about the power drop off from bfa to shadowlands with this 15+ system. The system isn't even live yet, so I'm not that doom and gloom, but I am really surprised I haven't heard more apprehension about this 15+ system in general. I'm not switching characters until shadowlands actually launches and am largely not motivated by power gain so this really doesn't affect me much. 

tl;dr I don't like the idea of the +3 corruption cores being added on top of a rank 15 cloak. I feel as weeks pass it takes additional weeks for an alt to catch up. The content the +3 cores comes from don't need additional incentives for alts or mains. It is going to result in a steeper power drop off for mains going into shadowlands. And in general I don't see the point in limiting who benefits from a power gain like this and at what rate, especially during an end of expansion patch.",4,1584558370,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkv3ni/so_why_isnt_there_more_apprehension_to_the_15/,wow,0

fkutmn,Shirofune,The Visions guaranteed corruption drop fixes nothing,"I mean, the system has the same issues the Legendary system in Legion had, no way to target what you want and RNG adquisition.

The thing is, Legendaries at least removed themselves from the pool of items the moment you got one you didn't want, so the chances to get the one you wanted increased as you got more legendaries.

That doesn't happen with corruptions.

Also, you require a high ilvl on (most) of them. Infinite Stars is still broken in any kind of Single Target encounter and I highly doubt Blizzard is going to nerf it by now.

Having guaranteed drops from Visions guarantees nothing because:

1/ You're only getting 2 or 3 extra items in which iLvl is relevant, because let's be honest, a 455 or less item isn't appealing when you're doing mythic corruption. That is 2 or 3 extra rolls into the lottery fiesta. The 'repeatable' vision (repeatabale my ass, locked behind 10k coalesence) is 430 ilvl, which is garbage.

2/ Doesn't fix the basic issue with the system. A way to target corruptions.

3/ This system is still highly frustrating for someone that is trying to improve his performance.",25,1584557413,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkutmn/the_visions_guaranteed_corruption_drop_fixes/,wow,1

fksl4n,Milesdavisiv,Character Account Transfer Achievements,"TL:DR - I have two WoW accounts. If I transfer a character from one account to another, do achievements, mounts and inventory move with me?

I started playing WoW in vanilla, and played all through WoD. I quit the game when I got married, and had no intention of going back to it. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, I got the itch to play again, and started a new account. For the life of me, I couldn’t remember the old hotmail account email or password I used. It was a now deactivated email account anyway, so there was little hope of being able to get any info from it. I made a new account to screw around with for a month, planning to scratch my itch and deactivate. Well, now I have 3 lvl 120 characters and have pre-ordered Shadowlands. Damn you Warcraft...

My office has closed down, so I am now working from home. While at home this week, I fired up an old computer so I could use it for background music. Once I got it running, I saw that WoW was still installed, and my login info was saved!!! I logged into the account and was able to see my 11 old characters again! No lie, It was a little emotional to run around with those old characters, look through old inventory, and even see names of old friends in my friends list. 

Now I am a little stuck. I have one new account with some well geared 120’s, and Shadowlands preordered. I have another account with 12 years of my life invested in it, but no Battle for Azeroth or Shadowlands... My thought was to dump inventory onto one character from the old account and transfer it to the new account. However, I will literally be moving an old character just to get the old achievements and mounts onto my new account. Has anyone used this service before, and if so, did all of the achievements, mounts and inventory move with you?",4,1584549758,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fksl4n/character_account_transfer_achievements/,wow,1

7 of the zones:

Why is trade district opposite?
Kill boss, do stuff.

Not saying this is the worst thing that can happen, but it kinda is a weird hiccup in a great gamemode. Trade District is the practically the only sidezone that people will accidentally leave prematurely.

Its solveable with some more attention (just look back at the minimpa), but as visions get easier people will be running it faster and with less focus, and we are bound to see more premature exits.

fkosd8,Poj1,"Can Blizzard please do something about phasing, it really kills leveling via questing.","Yo r/wow,

I am not usually the type to go complain about things online, but this has really been rubbing me the wrong way for a while now.

So I am currently leveling a mage on Draenor EU, an I have been leveling pretty much completely via questing, since I am going for loremaster as I level this alt. It has been smooth sailing up to 80, but Northrend has been absolutely horrible, especially Icecrown, the point I am stuck at now.

So as I am sure everyone is aware, questing is pretty much dead, if you do /who in any of the zones while you level you will see a max of about 5 players your level, and maybe some max levels doing dailies for pets etc. at peak hours.

Each quest line in the Icecrown for some reason seems to be phased, the only time I run into another player is when you sit outside the ICC entrance, an see people going in and out to solo it. It is so unhealthy for the game (an MMO especially) to isolate all the players from each other. An its more problematic now that the world is so empty, than it ever has been before.

Attempting to complete quests that require you to kill named elites, while unable to get help from higher level players because they cant phase in since they've already completed those quests, and unable to get help from people my own level, because simply there is no players even doing the quests, or they are on a different part of the quest line to you is frankly infuriating.

So I am here playing an MMO, asif its a singe player RPG, because Blizzard wont allow me to interact with other players, to even do simple things such as kill elites in the open world, because they feel the need to phase the little amount of players there is into their own instances.

Please Blizzard, remove phasing based on quest and level's, from old content zones, its so painful I might just give up leveling alts and going for loremaster (which is one of the few things still keeping me playing.)",11,1584534782,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkosd8/can_blizzard_please_do_something_about_phasing_it/,wow,1

In wow, you only get the ilusion of choice, actually you are doing (what blizzard puts on the table) what everyone is doing over and over again, every day, for ... i am not sure for what, today, also all classes are... in 8.2 i had a close to maxed out itlvl warlock, what i mean is any warlock had the same or extremely close warlock as mine, spells, resistance, dmg, the looks can be different but that is probably also not the case, because most warlocks run or aim for the same shoulders, head etc, so i could log on to another account AND have the same warlock, with the same stuff to do, if there is choice, its things that are not rewarding other than seeing the beautiful world of warcraft. In Destiny2 the classes and subclasses can be build by your own choice, mixed with armor or weapons that change the way the class acts in fights, pvp or pve. All the campaign, missions and stuff you can do in the world are rewarding, both by experience and possibly loot. The thing is you can do a lot of different activities when and however you want.

fkkol2,slipciok85,Between expansions?,"I'm a big lore, story fan in WoW - mostly I play for them. And technically I make them all :D

I also have ilvl473 character, and don't need more (I finished raid and 1000 of M+ runs). I also play a lot in pvp (I have 15 lvl cloak, great corruptions, make huge dps, be a good tank when is needed and making some healing).

Problem is... I can't find to do more in WoW... I don't care about pets, mounts, making alts (I play only one character and that for me enough, don't see reason to make everything the same again).

But ye it's only me :)

Just curious, because I don't see too many reasons to stay for next months, year in game before Shadowlands. But many people stay and play all the time. How? What You doing in that time between expansions? Where is no new patches, and nothing new happening. Yes, I have friends in game, but is boring to making same and same and same... it's ok for 1000 times, but after... Just not too much.

Time to play other games :)

fkjsdp,jp06279,New Lore Friendly Cities,"With all the new allied races, store mounts, and story choices, I'm sure some people feel the same way I do, that, while all this new stuff is neat, Iome of it just doesn't fit into the lore that well. So I thought I'd share some ideas on possible new/updated cities that people would want, and would fit better into the lore.

Gilneas is a beautiful city, and it sits empty. Since the night elves helped the Worgen when they needed them most, it would make sense for the Cenarion Circle to find a way to clear any remaining plague from the land, and repopulate the zone with a mixture of Darnassus refugees and Worgen. Since Calia may have a part in guiding the Forsaken in the future, you could have quest lines in Silverpine Forest where the Forsaken and Worgen either have a new warzone, or a questline for peace efforts.

The Forsaken have lost the Undercity, and right now it's uninhabitable. The eastern plaguelands would be a perfect place for them to reinhabit. There's the scarlet dk starting zone on the eastern end of the zone. There's also Stratholme. There could be a questline where you and Calia help the undead there regain free will and put out the flames of the city. It'd be a perfect chance for Calia to redeem her family name for her brother's mistakes in the very place where he started to go mad and crossed the line. Of course these places would be phased, with a bronze dragon ambassador able to take you back in time for the old content.

fkjee4,VampiricGoddess,I have a feeling that we'll see Azshara again in shadowlands,"In the Nyolotha she says that she's done with heralds. And she's looking at a new throne of power.

She also says to Sylvanas that she isn't blind to the power that Sylvanas seeks. 

Also if you pay attention to her coloring, green and grey (death like colors) isn't something a old god being would be. They tend to like the purples and oranges.

Some people might argue that she's after another power in the void, which i doubt. She specifically says that she's done with heralds and the void is infamous for having heralds.

Also in her death cinematic, she 9/10 went to the maw or Revendreth. I'm thinking Revendreth because, yes she's done some horrible things, but she's not beyond salvation.

When she'll arrive or what her plans will be, we don't know

fkiyi5,ARedditorCalledQuest,War Mode,"Am I the only one who doesn't hate it? Balance issues aside, I think it's implemented pretty well. 

Let me start by saying I'm an avid fan of PvP. I hit 1,000 HKs before hitting 50 quests completed and did so many random battlegrounds during the leveling process that my guild mate had to pay for my flight training because I hit level 70-something and only had like 300 gold. My Hunter's Core Hounds are named Loktar and Ogar and before that I had a pair or wolves named Blood and Thunder. I'm also very anti camping and anything else that makes the game unplayable for some poor bastard just because somebody else feels like being a douche. 

And that's why I love the way War Mode works. Opting in to PvP requires more effort than opting out, which largely removes the incentive for griefing. If some five man gank bank decides to set up shop in a level 20 questing zone and repeatedly blast everyone back to their local Spirit Healer, it's almost trivial to simply turn your flag off and get back to playing the game. Meanwhile if I see someone on the other faction does have WM enabled, I know that they went all the way to their capitol city and made a conscious choice to keep the War in Warcraft. The mechanic also makes it really difficult to scout with your flag off, find some unsuspecting lowbie, and then flag up and drop him. If you're looking for trouble, then you're looking for trouble; there are no half measures involved. 

The other cool thing is that it allows me to play with my friends who don't enjoy world PvP without me having to roll a character on a PvE server, or them having their experience spoiled by making one on a PvP server. I can simply turn my flag off, run around with them, and then pop my guild cloak to Orgrimmar when I'm ready to hunt the Alliance again. 

It does cause some issues with the group finder, like using a summoning stone and whatnot, but overall I think it's a really good system that offers players a choice in how they want to play without putting up a hard wall between the two halves of the player base.",65,1584502276,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkiyi5/war_mode/,wow,1

fkiasi,RK-043,Make MoP CM account wide,"I really wish they would make the challengemode gearsets from Mists account wide, like they did in WoD. 

I’m a transmog addict. I’ve put many, MANY hours into transmogging my characters to my liking, so this really grinds my gears.

Nobody’s complaining about the way they gained their weapons accountwide, the “lazy” way by buying a token after completing in on one. Then there’s the thick people saying warriors could unlock all so it would’ve been unfair. HOWEVER they also could’ve made those weapons bound to the specific character you’ve done it on, like the MoP challengemode set. But people would’ve lost their shit if Blizz did that. so why should the Pandaria sets be this restricted? 

I don’t even play the characters anymore that I’ve gotten the cm’s on. The developers messed that up by destroying some classes brutally and just not even worth looking it anymore because they play so awkwardly and there’s just no fun anymore in playing them. 

I’ve done my cm’s on a tank, 2dps and a healer. I’ve got the medals, I’ve got the skills, I am worthy. And with me there’s so many other players who were worthy of collecting the CM gear back then.

However I’ve changed characters, I’ve changed main, none of which have the challengemode set. Why should I be punished by not getting the best looking gear in game just because I simply didn’t have the time to do it on all characters? I have proven myself in the CM’s but just lacked time. Because life happened, because there’s school, there’s work, there’s family and friends, there’s relationships, there’s even guilds depending on raiding. Hell i didnt even level up the char back then that now is my main.

They’ve made WoD weapons extremely accessible, the MoP mounts were accountwide, which in my opinion wasn’t too bad of a thing to do. They have even made legendary’s transmoggable accountwide now! People have farmed weapons like thunderfury for months and months and months,  sometimes even years. (Those items were some of the more exclusive things ingame even tho they were easy to farm it still took many months of dedicated farming and rng.)
And yet they refuse to bring out a token, to give the people who have already well proven themselves worthy, to get the challengemodes on characters they NOW play.

TLDR; WoD CM weapons and MoP mounts were accessible accountwide on all toons, even LEGENDARYS are accessible accountwide to transmog now to all toons. People who’ve gotten gold in MoP CM have proven themselves and should be rewarded by the same concept as the ones mentioned before.",0,1584499399,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkiasi/make_mop_cm_account_wide/,wow,1
fkiao1,DoomRevenant,Has anyone ever really given much thought to the disparity in the number of naga limbs in older vs newer content?,"So, it was just casually scrolling through the new hearthstone card reveals for the outland-themed expansion, since I was bored, and upon looking at the art for Lady Vashj, I thought to myself ""oh, that's right, Vashj has 6 arms"", and I remembered that Queen Azshara only has 4...  In fact, if you look at the older models for the notable female naga leaders, like Lady Vashj and Lady Naz'jar (Boss of Abyssal Maw), they all have 6 arms, whereas the newer versions of the same model type, like Tidemisteress Athissa (Naga leader in Aszuna), they all have 4 arms

In fact, Lady Vashj's original WCIII model had 6 arms, and her Reforged model (even the updated one without the eara) only has 4 arms - they literally cut off 2 of her arms when they remastered her

Does anyone have any guesses as to why that is? It seems 6-armed naga just dont exist in-game after cataclysm, and that's really weird imo",9,1584499386,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkiao1/has_anyone_ever_really_given_much_thought_to_the/,wow,1

I mean imagine what players can come up with for transmog.

I feel like having sexy/skimpy armors, especially for cloth would be a good idea. Not all warlocks and priests wear hooded robes, it gets to... the same, in a bad a bad way.

Person: Sally (warlock) what are you wearing today, 

Sally: Robes, same as always. 

But think about it from a artistic point of view. You could make a lady death mog. A sexy spider witch troll. Make a dark version of Alexstraza.

Now for a rp standpoint. A edgy warlock that uses the power of seduction to lure in victims to ultimately kill and use their souls for her magic. A blood dk with the same idea but lure in her victims for their blood. (actually that's not a bad idea from a rp perspective)

fkgbo6,brakndawnt,It'd be nice if Blizzard used this time to address some long standing issues with the game.,"I mean, I'm sure there would be some vocal minorities that would scream about delays.  But, let's be real here.  It'd be silly to expect Shadowlands to not be delayed with everything that's going on.  Hell, I'd welcome it just to have some confidence things wouldn't get dropped just to meet deadlines during a fucking pandemic.

Wouldn't it be amazing if Blizzard just accepted the delay and, given that they're likely working with a smaller crew, focus on addressing long standing issues with the game?  Or perhaps implementing some of the more 'shits and giggles' ideas I'm sure the devs have had that they've been too scrapped for time to mess around with?  Those of you in development style fields I'm sure have some pet projects you'd like to play around with if you had, say two months to dedicate to.

I'd argue they wouldn't even be 'wastes of time' either, given that random fun dev-focused style things like that tend to be what draws a lot of people in.  Pepe was one of those.  The WoW secret battle pets and such are other examples.  Maybe making more mounts compatible with the paint colors in Mechagon.  Many of these side projects (Pepe being the best example) often even get fleshed out as the game goes on.

Devs alleviated of a time constraint, even for a month or two, tend to come up with some pretty fantastic ideas.  It'd be great if Blizz recognized that and used this opportunity (albeit bittersweet) to let them play around a bit.",2,1584491252,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkgbo6/itd_be_nice_if_blizzard_used_this_time_to_address/,wow,1

[Preview](https://media.wago.io/screenshots/Q8C9D9H3O/5e70d362bb693a297f44988d.png)
  
This WeakAura includes all currencies in the game (if some are missing, please let me know) and a couple items like key fragments or mechagon parts.  
It features many customization options, like only showing specific currencies in specific places. For example: Titan Residuum is only shown in the area of the vendor.  
You can even add your own items to track if you'd want that. Maybe you want to add Flasks to the list, you can do this without knowing a single thing about LUA code.  
  
This WeakAura is only a singular weakaura. It's not a big group with one weakaura for each currency or item. You can place it in any other group you'd like, or don't put it in any group at all.  
  
Echoes of Ny'alotha has already been added to the list, it show's up when you're in the Chamber of Heart.

During the unpruning announcement at Blizzcon 2019 about Mages, Its pretty obvious to see that the BFA devs only looked at Classic because of its successful launch and thought that “ok they seem to like it so we will adjust retail more towards Classic”

Doing this for Classes in Shadowlands would be an absolutely huge mistake. Classes are the nr 1 worst part of Classic  
Nobody is playing Classic because the classes are enjoyable. They are all complete sh\*t.

Ask yourself this, DURING LEGION did anyone ever complained about Frost mages not having Fire blast or Arcane Explosion?

ASk yourself this, Do you think someone who played Frost mage during Legion even thought about Fire blast or Arcane Explosion?

The Artifact weapon system and legendary system made every Specialization feel well equipped with spells and effects that connected and synergized with that Specialization

People are complaing today because you removed everything that made classes great in Legion. NOT things about Classic

Frost Mage aswell as any specialization has a synergized Rotation. Fire blast nor Arcane Explosion doesnt fit into it at all and neither does frostbolt fit into Fire Mages Rotation.

Classes in WoW Retail is Legions way of playing. NOT CLASSIC

The alt didn't have any, but could earn the currency and view the essence vendor tab on Mother, so I did the quests for Rank 3 Crucible which I figured would meet the requirements for my main character to get the currency. No dice, fair enough because its the same essence so I guess that also doesn't count. I then found my rep with Naz was high enough on my alt to buy the rank 3 from the quartermaster and did so, giving my main the ability to earn the currency as it did not yet have that one.   


Here's the kicker though, after being able to earn the currency initially on my alt, learning the Rank 3 Crucible essence which was also the only Rank 3 my main had then took away my ability to earn that currency and view the essence inventory on mother for the alt.

fkb1zv,queenx,Blizzard killed the fun of having alts,"So I see many people praising the rank 3 essences on alts band-aid patch, but am I really the only one that doesn’t care anymore about alts? Too little and too late.

I used to have a lot of fun playing with alts up to Pandaria. Blizzard removed all the fun from that by making the system layering somewhat ridiculous.

I guess in order to play with an alt nowadays you must:

- Farm azerite gears with the correct traits for a single role (or have all those gears for each role in your bag).
- Have your cloak leveled up to the max. This means you need to catch up with all the horrific visions, do dailies on all your alts.
- Pray for the RNG on top of RNG of the stupid corruption system (which I honestly don’t get why some people think this system is fun).
- An then have all the correct essences at level 3 for your alts. This is what the latest patch tried to fix with a band-aid but it introduced yet another system and currency to deal with, so there’s even a confusing table of what rewards what.

I’m a semi-hardcore player, mostly casual, and the investment I have to make into a single character at this point is ridiculous. Even if I was a hardcore player I’d feel this was bad.

I know hindsight is 20/20 but it’s so sad to see a good WoW expansion (in terms of content) be completely ruined by the game design itself.

I hope Shadowlands fix this but given the latest interviews with Ion, I feel like we’re going to see another fail of game design mechanics again. Why? Because they’re patting on their backs about the awesome systems done in BfA.

Bringing it back to the main topic of this post, I’d like to see less gearing systems so that I can play with my alts and have fun again. Give me more challenges (Mage Tower please) and cosmetic rewards rather than trying to lock me up on a single character and single role.

I understand many people don’t like to play with alts but that doesn’t mean Blizzard has to make the experience unpleasant for the rest of us.",4,1584472181,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fkb1zv/blizzard_killed_the_fun_of_having_alts/,wow,1

fk8qt6,idols2effigies,"Blizzard Should Respond to Covid-19 with In-Game Events, Helping Fight Boredom from Social Distancing","Just as the title says. I think it would be a smart move for Blizzard to have some sort of in-game event (or events) during this public health crisis. People are being recommended to stay in their homes and, in many cases, stay away from work. Blizzard has an opportunity, the type of product it sells, to do a lot of public good while simultaneously increasing its user base. 

My immediate thought is to do a 'free weekend' style event, but make it longer (ie - for a couple of weeks). I'm sure anyone who isn't currently subbed (and is under quarantined or performing social distancing) would appreciate the distraction without worrying about their finances (should they find themselves temporarily unable to work). Not just a PR move, it could also reestablish the player base and maybe win some people back when they get the 'hooks' in them again. Once the event has passed and we're given the 'all clear' to go out into the world again, they may just choose to stick around. If this prediction is true, it would see a period of increasing numbers of active players in the late stages of an expansion (which would be an opposite trend from usual, where numbers don't increase until new expansions near their launch). 

If they don't feel like opening the flood gates and allow subscription-less play during this time, maybe boost XP or REP gains for an extended period of time, encouraging people to level alts. Anything that they can offer 'in game' to provide home-bound players incentive to stay entertained would be a win for everyone, in my opinion.",7,1584464467,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fk8qt6/blizzard_should_respond_to_covid19_with_ingame/,wow,1

It’s a majority opinion that thrall is a lot easier, but the more I am doing alleria, the more fun the fight feels than thrall. I’m gonna list out how melee are supposed to interact with some of these abilities. 

-Darkened sky takes two seconds to activate once it is cast, start to run away from her and then run back in to avoid an awkward overlapping casts (bombs/poly + sky)

-The bombs are oddly fear-able. (Intimidating shout and psychic scream work). If you are feeling lazy and want to burn without clicking bombs, warriors/priests can do that. 

-Never tank her in the middle unless you intend kick all explosives away. She will always drops explosives on you, and if you tank her in the middle, you must kick them or else void eruption becomes very hard to follow up on afterward since she always teleports to the middle.

-You can LoS alleria using the pillars to stop her ranged auto shot and get her closer to you. This is particularly helpful following a darkened sky cast, but be wary of polymorph follow up.

-Burned bridge only drains 6 sanity after standing in it for 2-3 seconds. It’s worth it to jump back in to interrupt polymorph. Don’t be scared to take a tick of it. The explosive fire on the other hand takes 36 sanity a tick.",9,1584462743,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fk88t4/as_much_as_i_hate_alleria_i_am_starting_to/,wow,1

fk6u2n,Renkarem,This game feels like it's in a continuous state of beta. Can we please end this cycle?,"I can't say how it was before MoP but ever since and especially in WoD this game has begun to start the same cycle over and over again and I think we all have been noticing it in this and the last expansion. 

New features get introduced. They're broken. Blizzard says they will fix them in the next x.1 patch. They just add another system, which then needs reworking itself. They say they will fix it in x.2. Then they add another system while the old one isn't fixed. They make us beg for bandaids for months until they implement it and when they implement it they only do it at 50% if not less. 

Classes are boring and overly homogenized and some are behind by a lot with core rotation issues. They say they will fix it in x.1. The patch arrives and its only number hotfixes that could have been done months before. Core rotation still has the same issues and they say they have to do a next rework next expansion. So people go to their alts but can't play them because of gearing issues. Refer to the cycle above, demonstrating the unwillingness to let go of that. 

And at the end the expansion gets fixed to 70% and we can actually enjoy having fun. Next expansion rolls around. Repeats the same mistakes again. It feels like we are in an infinite loop and never arrive at the state the expansion was supposed to be at launch. It's similiar to playing a beta with the game just getting a new version of a beta and being stuck in development hell for years.

fk5miw,ruleqwertyfour,How do I make other tank specs fun?,"This thread will be directed at doing dungeon/Mythic+ content, as I don’t have any current intention of tanking Heroic/mythic raiding.

Disclaimer: I am a newer player to tanking, I’ve only really pushed keys to +7’s or +8’s, I haven’t done anything as high as a +15. So everything I’m about to post is entirely anecdotal from my new/low experience of each spec in what would be considered easier content.

I’ve been spoiled as a prot warrior tank. It is probably the most fun I’ve ever had tanking anything in this game. Becoming a massive colossal and just nuking things down with hard hitting thunder claps and blocking everything like this stalwart bad@$$ that doesn’t take anything from anyone is truly the pinnacle of sword and board to me. Even after heavy nerfs to this build it will forever be my go to.

That being said, I’m not a huge fan of playing a warrior dps. I want to play a class to enjoy most of what the class has to offer, not secluded to one aspect (spec) of that class. So I like dabbling with their dps or healing specializations as well.

I’ve recently gotten into Ret and Unholy, both specs are quite fun for me, but I’m feeling at a crossroads. How do I make Blood and Protection paladin more fun to play? On trash pulls they feel fine, I have what I consider fun abilities at my disposal such as Bone storm and consistent Avenger’s shield procs to get juicy damage.

But it doesn’t quite carry over to boss fights.

Blood feels underwhelming, I feel as though I’m just HS spamming to get large amounts of runic power just to wait for that hard hitting ability to DS back to max. re-up on bone armor, cast DND and just kinda sit there.

As for Protection Paladin, I’d say it’s a little more fun. I’m mostly just utilizing my spells to get proper uptime on my active mitigation and making sure I have a SotR before that hard hitter, with the procing of Avenger’s shield adding bonus damage, a shiny “oooo I get to hit this button now” feeling is nice.

But they don’t equate to prot warrior, I can still do my devastating clap rotation on boss and just be having the time of my life seeing myself popping up on that damage meter.

Because of LIFO, and people who cancel-scan and relist all the time, MOST items return in the mail, so it requires relisting over and over and listing fees pile up.

It's seems you need to babysit your auctions unless you sell a few ""hotcakes"" items that sell soon after posting (a short time later a cancel-scanner would have undercut you)

Do you think this because of the ability to cancel auctions and LIFO or do most items in WOW simply have a really low demand but high supply.

fk52o5,Lilletuss,Why Uther is gonna be female in Shadowlands.,"Now, I know what you're thinking, I'm spitting straight heresy right now. And I agree, I want Uther to be Uther. But we need to look at this from a logical standpoint.  


Shadowlands was probably created when Blizzard realized they had killed off all the cool characters, and that no one liked their new ones. So, they had to find a way to bring all those characters back, Illidan-style. So, everyone is traveling to the Shadowlands to meet their beloved old friends.  


What does this have to do with genderbent Uther, you might say? Well, at the moment I can't think of any dead Female characters that I genuinely miss. I'm sure they exist, and that I'll be told in the comments, but I can't think of any iconic ones of the top of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

This is, of course, a crisis for a sell-out corporation such as Acti-Blizz. They need a strong, independent female character the Feminists can rally behind, but where do they find that? Enter the realm of Bastion.  


See, Bastion is ruled by a hierarchy of Kyrians. A kyrian is not necessarily something you're created or born as, it's something you become. We already know Uther is pretty far up in the Kyrian hierarchy, meaning he has most likely ascended and become a Kyrian. Here's the thing, though.  


We have never seen a Male Kyrian. They're always Female. Val'kyr, spirit healers, the entire bunch. All female. Even when you're fighting Odyn as a Male character, you turn into a Female Val'kyr. We know that a Kyrian gets a new body when they ascend, Vrykul Hyrja looks nothing like Val'kyr Hyrja.  


So, where does that leave Uther? Well, if he has ascended and become a Kyrian, he has most likely gotten a new, female, Kyrian body. From an Out-Of-Game standpoint, it will allow Blizzard to have a strong, independent female character.  It even gives them a character arc they can start and never finish!  


That's my theory. Now, go tell me how heretical I am being.",6,1584451010,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fk52o5/why_uther_is_gonna_be_female_in_shadowlands/,wow,1

fk4hpa,drogba_best,Could Blizzard be throwing sand in our eyes(again)?,"Probably someone has already theory crafted on this matter and if so I apologise for my post on a already discussed matter.

Here I go, well I recently returned from a 8 year break and decided to start reading about the game and watching videos so I can get in on the discourse surrounding the game and literally the first day I was hit with  this avalanche of complaining people (with reasonable opinions)  how this expansion is mega alt unfriendly and people are basically locked to a single character because no one with  even 1% sanity would farm this boring ass content on 2 or 3 characters and rightly so. The more I learn about the game and the more I progress with mythics and raiding and gearing I began to suspect this is part of their plan.

Blizzard have known since day of releasing the current essence system that no one would farm the shit 2 times so people would start to complain more and more as the underwhelming expansion unfolds and people just basically stop playing because having a variety of characters to chose from is the core of this game for people who take it seriously ( at least imo). So they were just adding to the narrative by saying  22421332 times they will not unlock wide essences and  this has dragged for multiple months in which playing alts is simply not worth it because let's  be honest Nazjatar and even the current daily and weekly content is ass most of the time and it purposefully made to be dragged out for months even on your  main toon.

So why suddenly realise this version of ""alt- attainable"" essences? Why now after the patch is already 2 months old and just before the shadowlands beta? Well simple so you have just enough motivation to play 2 more months until they start spoon feeding us Shadolands stuff so we get hooked on the idea of a better expansion. 

For me they have had such a strategy from the beginning so that people don't have ""fun"" but so that people are tied down to time gated weekly grind. They don't want you to be able to do everything you can in 3 weeks, they want to drag it out for 2/3 months per character if possible. This game is becoming more and more like other ruined products (Fifa UT) . I hope they start valuing their players but i doubt it.

Oh well at least now I can farm up shit and replay the vision content untill I die on my alts ....",11,1584448556,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fk4hpa/could_blizzard_be_throwing_sand_in_our_eyesagain/,wow,1

fk3p5e,MarsPain_ttv,Legion Weapon ARTIFACTS &gt; Essences.,"So i stopped playing after i killed Gul´Dan out of Job Reasons...  
Got now back to BfA 1 week ago. I got first few Essences and azerite armour and so on...  
I know it´s not much time to realize or to have the right to say anything about this...

But WHY did they removed the legion weapon Artifacts? Will this happen same now with Shadowlands where they will just erase the essences and make all this grind (ALL THIS TIME YOU INVESTED) for nothing?  


Because the thing is what i see here now is really that every class is and feels the same.

AZERITE GEAR= OKAY. It´s still some variety for your choice inside your class. In common with Legion Weapon Artifacts. It gaved you an REALLY GOOD reason to choose which class you personally LIKE the most. It gaved every class something special on their IDENTITY on top of it. Cherrie on de cakE.  


ESSENCES is completely a no go. Because it does not matter what class you play everything feels the same...Same like corrupted.. ""You hitting MOB/player for like 30 seconds do some sustain or burst dmg and bring him down to 50% or eventually kill and than next time you hit him ONCE and get a lucky proc and he/they are just GONE. And after that you see the ""corrupted/essence did 120% dmg while you did like 10% dmg.   


I´m Really Missing the Legion Artifacts. THe classes were so much different and you could really feel the difference if you were against an Warlock&amp;Warrior or Rogue&amp;Priest.. now it doesnt matter against who you play because you are always going to die due to the Corrupted/Essences... And not that specific Comp. combo.  


Is it just me or do you folks also see that Legion Weapon Artifacts felt and actually were more playable &amp; Funnier than essences?  Azerite Traits i find actually okay. But this Comparison makes me ""bruh"".

fk3g70,Noob_at_games,It feels like I'm the only one who hates Horiffic Visions.,"I hear so much love for them all the time, about how it's great solo content...

A lot of the issues I have probably wont affect the main demographics of people with one character who raid and have high gear score.

For me they're as frustrating as shit. Firstly, I find them time consuming, a full run taking about 20 mins, which isn't long, but it adds up when you're on the 3+ quest items. The problem is it's not just play.. It's play and focus \*intently\*. Again not a real problem for most people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my characters are not the best geared, I don't (can't) raid, so I get my gear from every alternate source, warfronts, visions, emissaries, pvp etc. I have them about 450 each. Some classes breeze through them like it's a joke, other's struggle to get off the ground. The disparity in classes is HUGE and makes some just so unfun to play. Literally I can complete 3 masks on some while others struggle to finish 5 wings maskless.

&amp;#x200B;

Then we add masks into the mix. At the moment, I'm on about 3 masks. I have all 5 unlocked. I picked the easiest three, I had about 60 corruption on my guy because the gear is my best gear (Infinite stars), but I swear to god at one point tonight, I wasn't in control of my character for like 20 seconds. I got bounced pulled, autojumped stunned, feared... I tried using my cloak but the damage just rolled in until I died. I'd already used my free save on a similar situation.... and the thing is. I can handle moving out of things, but sometimes, you get a bad combo of several affixes at once. 

You have to stop, only you have to move, only if you move, you AUTO move further, then X Y Z and you die. 

It has to be the most frustrating thing ever. At least with the mage tower I almost always had control over my character... here I just... get thrown around all over the place until I die. I've got things walking to me from all directions, but I can't move, then they just obliterate or CC me until death. 

Rant over... super unfun for me.",13,1584443428,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fk3g70/it_feels_like_im_the_only_one_who_hates_horiffic/,wow,1
fk3ftp,The_Skarmlol,Dear activision's Blizzard,"Dear Blizzard. Thats why you lose your customers.

A message to the gamers that are losing theyr time playing World of warcraft

(disclamer-sorry for my bad english, not my native language)

I am playing WoW classic since relise, (i am a world of warcraft player since relise and i have 1200days played ingame on retail)

Its since september that WoW classic relise and i started playing it. Its march and i have 90days played online, since the begining of this blizzard accepts the abusers and fixing the bugs after they get theyr rewards, lets break this down for now.

1st shitty approve for the abusers blizzard did, raid on dungeons for like 7-9 people, in low level they accept it for 4-5 days (untill the abusers make theyr leveling) and then they nerfed it. (I did a report for that to ask if they know about this and IF they nerf it and they said we cant do nothing) and then when the hard abusers got to level they nerf for the low time people that have also work to do and cant play 24/7.

2nd thing and most shitty, is for the Honor system... Oh man... blizzard show theyr shitty emplyees and terms here, so in the very beginign the cross realm abuse premading (pressing all together the ""join battle"") and entering the battleground for like 30 people together froma discord server on cross realm assist, so most servers had the problem that big guilds kept the top spots and asked for REAL MONEY to leave the spot for the grand marshal to another player (like 400euro). SO no1 else could take the rank14 spot.

I asked blizzard if they know that and they answered me we do know it but we cant do nothing about it. And by the time all of the big guild players took theyr rank 14 (or at last 13) they nerfed the cross realm and none of the low budget/time players could make honor.

So... here comes the funny thing, (and thats my problem and why i am writting this) I did honor farming SOLO... just solo... and to go solo r14 if some1 knows, in a full server you need like 20h/day, so i did that BUT i had to go afk some time alt tab doing something more or my brain would melt OFCOURSE.... i am a humman beeing, and by the time i was afk i was getting report from people couldn't kill one single horde and bitching around (i dont judge that much cause i totaly accept that) and blizzard ban me (and of course other people like me) for 7 days... (7 days means that i am like 3 weeks behind now because it will derank me that much of 3 weeks solo work).

So i decided to make a ticket and talk with them. and when they answered i said that first of all i am not using any 3rd party program, second is that i am alt tab some times cause i am 20h./day because u dont do anything for the abusers and thats what it needs to farm to r14 SOLO, then the guild master answers me that he doesent care you need to play all the time, (apparently he doesnt play the game..) so i told him that i understand that you dont play the game BUT if you want me to play 20/day for like 2 months i need to be alt tab some times, i am not a cross realm abuser OR a bitch asking for my friends to do the work for me, i farm solo and doing my shit on my own.. but thats not the thing.

The thing is after all that i am writting that, HEY BLIZZARD you accept abusers AND money sellers for spots on ranking, but you dont accept some1 ranking solo and trying to stay on pc 20h/day... So if you dont respect your customers, dont ask them to respect you back, thats why u needed activision to buy your company, because u SUCK.

Thats all folks. Thanks for reading i wanted to QQ a bit for wasting so much time in a company like that and, if you thinking quiting i would tell you to change a game before they did something to prove you right your thoughts to change game.

fk0l7b,Worried-Advice,Do you think WoW should be free during the Covid-19 pandemic?,"Activision-Blizzard has a track record of good works: stepping up in times of disaster, to raise funds for disaster relief, and doing charitable work:

* Cenarion Hatchling pet sale to raise money in response to the Japanese tsunami
* Hurricane Sandy - Cinder Kitten
* Various pets created to raise money for Make-A-Wish, breast cancer.
* Australian bushfire package (Call of Duty)

Now the US and most of the world are being asked to shelter in place, socially distance and self-isolate to reduce the spread of coronavirus (flatten the curve and prevent health services being overwhelmed). 

Wouldn't it be a truly noble thing for Activision-Blizzard to make WoW free to past subs during this crisis? They'd be doing their part to keep the population indoors and safe. Think of all the good publicity they would get, after a run of bad publicity with the Hong Kong and Warcraft 3 Reforged debacle.

fk0kca,NotVeryFamous,Where can I find a breakdown of how to collect the warfront / battle season 1 (plate) set appearances,"Hey,

So I'm trying to wrap my head around the absolute mess that is the appearances of the battle season 1 sets. I absolutely love the appearance of them, on both factions but it's becoming a bit of a headache to figure out this system. 

Pieces are the same name, despite being different tiers of the set. There's re-colours, there's several ways of obtaining the appearance but most of them don't count towards the set in your appearance tab, tier 3 set has been unlisted in said tab despite still being available, you can pick up tier 3 pieces from the AH, rest I've no idea where to get it from. You can get most of your tier 2 through warfront winning but the head and shoulders are through the weekly warfront cache? where are the tier 3 pieces from? why are the uncanny set on Horde pieces of the 'Elite' t3 set, while on Alliance it's some of the tier 2 set in white? how do I get the rest of the white set? where is the tier 3 pieces from?

Sorry but this is just super confusing and looking anything up on Wowhead, with all those same named pieces, it just leads to nowhere, empty pages, transmog pages with a rabbit hole of more pieces that don't tell you where they are from.

Has anyone written a current guide or breakdown on how to obtain these sets, in their various colours and forms, my sanity would really appreciate it :P",4,1584427042,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fk0kca/where_can_i_find_a_breakdown_of_how_to_collect/,wow,1

fjxt34,BrandonAUS,This new essence system is a joke.,"So in [this post](https://www.wowhead.com/news=311661/echoes-of-nyalotha-details-obtaining-rank-3-essences-on-alts?webhook) they detail you need 500 of the currency to get your account wide\* essence and say how much we will get for each type of content. As a mostly M+ player who already gets the short straw when it comes to getting azerite gear, the tiny amount you get for a keystone is disappointing. 

On top of the fact this system should have been out with patch 8.3 so at least all the content I have done up till now including pvp/raid ect would have counted.

According to the post doing a +15 will reward 45 echoes where you get 50 for doing an emissary. Now sure I get it I can spam 15's all day where the emissary is locked to 1 per day, but I would argue that a +15 is slightly more challenging and should reward accordingly. To take it further if you do a +20 that's only 60 echoes where the minor assault gives 75. Again I understand the time gating but for a system that is account wide\* and introduced way later than it should have been I know at least I am let down by it.

Does it cut down on the length of the grind for essences? Yes, but it is still a grind, even if I am getting it for content I am doing already.

I also recognize that the more casual a play the less likely they are to care about essences on alts but the more casual players are hit harder as it will take them longer to get everything they need unlocked.

Sorry for this rant but this is a really bad system in my opinion for something that should not have any additional grind attached to it at all (at least in my opinion)

\*I know they are not actually account wide but there is 0 reasons for them not to be.

There is certainly 100 ways in which I am wrong but to me this feels like a case of the people making the system don't have to deal with how annoying it is.

However, we have yet to hear more and the cold grasp of Shadowlands is creeping closer upon Azeroth. WoW has quite a few servers that range from 'new player' to even 'medium' populations that have suffering economies and little to no options when it comes to guild options for raid content(Mythic).

What server do you play on that you believe needs to be connected to one or more realms as they've done in the past? Do you play on a connected server that still needs more attention?

We got them to listen in regard to BoA Essence feedback so my hope is that they will consider this well before the expansion so people will have time to plan.

fjt2if,Artunias,How can we make the grind feel good?,"I feel like the grinding has been one of the hottest topics of BfA and even going back to Legion and some AP farming that took place there.

It's still an MMO. I'm not sure you can just completely remove the grind, but I think we can make it a much more enjoyable experience and feel better.

**Class Designs**

First, and I'll be brief, class designs. When the classes are mind numbingly boring to play, and a huge majority of grinding content is mindless to play. I think you are left with a recipe that just isn't much fun at all. So, if classes are much more complete and engaging I think you are already several steps up on what exists today. I think they can improve on the content to some degree, but easy tasks will always exist. Complex gameplay doesn't need to exist at all levels of the game, but classes need to make up for that if you aren't raiding/pvp at the higher levels.

**Primary Progression That is Capped**

If you look at how AP has turned out. I simply think there needs to be a weekly cap that is tied into unlocking azerite powers, or artifact levels in Legion, maybe Anima will be used for Soulbinds in Shadowlands.

Whatever that system is. It needs to be capped on a weekly basis. The uncapped infinite grind system I don't think you can say has worked in either Legion or BfA. Blizzard also needs to be super careful and make sure this system doesn't lock core class gameplay behind it for more than a few weeks at most. It can augment abilities, enhance buttons you already press, but having another Azerite/Artifact system that leaves classes with gaping holes until acquired is no good.

**So What Do We Grind For?**

***Tertiary Stats*** - remove them from gear. Attain them gradually as a long term goal. Move speed, avoidance, leech, repair cost reduction. Maybe something like a Diablo paragon system could work here. I don't like tertiary stats being an RNG proc, but I think they are absolutely useful and would be a reasonable thing to have that is grindable. They aren't super powerful, but they certainly feel good to have, and I don't think you'll feel bad about being several points behind someone who is going at it hard.

***Sockets*** - Let's assume that WF/TF stays away (blizzard plz) I think Sockets work as an element of excitement and for stat customization. But we also need a way to make sure we can get sockets. I feel like what we see right now in 8.3 is a pretty good balance point for that.

***Cosmetics/Mounts/Gliders/Etc*** - A lot of stuff that we've seen on exalted vendors in the past. Teleportation rings, mounts, quality of life travel stuff, cool toys, transmogs, whatever! They can still have stuff locked behind exalted, but I think there can also be a grindable currency to acquire many things of this nature as well. Maybe profession materials could be a part of this too?",13,1584395100,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fjt2if/how_can_we_make_the_grind_feel_good/,wow,0

fjrmsg,rodolfotheinsaaane,"An open letter to Ion and the WoW team: ""Warcraft in the time of Covid19""","Dear Blizzard game desigers,

&amp;#x200B;

like many, I am now on lockdown and would love to spend some of that time playing World of Warcraft. As it stands, it's really difficult and frustrating.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now my playing session is something like this:

*- try to do the warfront contribution quests, hopping across all my alts to find/craft all the materials, and the distribute it on my active alts*

*- do my BfA missions on multiple alts*

*- do the assaults, and even if done already do the quests to get some rep. Also some item mount/rare/pet drops. This takes a long time for some quests*

*- catch up on some characters on old emissary quests before they expire, because need something like an essence or a drop from there still*

*- if relevant, do the weekly, in some cases as DPS it takes a while for the queue to pop, and can't swap to an alt and do stuff in the meantime without losing my queue*

*- do the weekly cape quest enough times to get all the pages*

and then, only then, I could finally start to push a key, pug a raid, or try to get that cool armor on PvP, but mostly I'm just exhausted and I log out. And without maxing most of the aforementioned activities in the list, one is not really viable.

This is a very frustrating state of affairs, and I don't believe I am alone in this, just from the sheer number of people asking for account wide essences for the past few months.

&amp;#x200B;

So I would like to offer my feedback before calling it a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the things I would like addressed before the Shadowland release, so can spend the next few months without feeling that WoW is my second (first?) job:

&amp;#x200B;

**- it's an alt world.** This is a wider point. The state of the art of gaming in 2004 is not the same as 2020, and players that wanted a vanilla experience got it (and how many there are out there!). The game is no longer one main character and maybe a mule, or one alt. The game should assume players with multiple characters, sharing resources between them. the game should adapt to allow for that gaming style. Only druids can do all roles, and not everyone plays a druid. So people play alts. Ghostcrawler said about 10 years ago ""bring the player not the class"" which was never true. I think it's overdue a change in that direction. I'm talking about soulbound gear becoming AoC, account wide essences, flight point unlocked and in general a slightly different design phylosophy.

&amp;#x200B;

**- 5 parallel gear progression systems.** Right now there is gear ilvl, corrupted gear, azerite for the neck, pages for the cloak, essences. All 5 are required in you want to be competitive for endgame content. I mean, wtf Blizz, it's insane that you are putting so many new progression systems on top of each other without removing old ones (the neck somewhat plateauing at 80 is the exception). And it's not about keeping people entertained until Shadowlands his, right now I won't even reach the point where I can be competitive to start attemping endgame content without a massive investment of time. Also running 10 times a week the same scenario in Orgrimmar/Stormwind gets old pretty quickly.

I get it that your philosophy has always been ""*no quick catchup for current endgame progression*"", and somewhat agree. But the azerite essences should be account wide, no rank 3 purchase bandaid. Make them account wide so I don't have to grind Nazjatar or Mechagon for the third time or whatever (or even the first time, as some rank 4 has not even dropped for me once).

&amp;#x200B;

**- experiment and islands.** Experiments are great, sometimes they don't work out so it's good that you are not doubling down (like Warfronts and Islands). Pity as islands had enormous potential as their own endgame content, to offer procedural content in a game where everything else is static. Instead of making islands a requirement due to azerite, I would recommend reworking them, with their own progression system (like pet battles), where you can unlock lore, drops a ton of archaeological artifacts thus gutting arch as a profession, WHICH WAS NEVER FUN (and if you look at the achievement completion you will see it consistently was at the bottom). TLDR make it their own endgame, don't force people to run it so they can raid. I know changing this might take more than a year would be not possible to justify working on BfA content in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

**- reduce grinds in old expansions, focus on current content.** Over the years the game has accumulated a large number of raids, with some drops (mostly mounts) at 0.03% or whatever. At first there were just a coveted few (Al'ar, Invincible) but now there are a ton. Ask the people that still run ICC 10 times a week on alts if they think it's fun or Stockholm syndrome. The effort of those that came before won't be diminished on content that is old. I have seen you recently upped the drop rate on some old mounts, but really put those at 5% and move on, so people can grind that in a month or two and they will be done. You can always add new drops to revisit those instances later.

&amp;#x200B;

**- wider interaction mechanics, add AI.** Everything in the game about combat, I get it, it's called WAR, CRAFT. But at the same time Azeroth is a second home for many of us where we can hang out. We want a living, breathing world - not only to stomp on its (her?) neck. WoW is not Dwarf Fortress, or The Sims, but the only interaction with the world is either a pre-scripted quest, or murder. Enough, please. Give us a wider interaction vocabulary, we have emotes already, doesn't have to be revolutionary. Ion said something about ""agency"" recently, which I thought it was groundbreaking, and while ""WoW will never be a game with complete freedom and choice in everything"" (as a friend put it) I am sure we can be given more choice (and I don't mean choice like in garrison - lvl 2 IIRC - where you had to move 5 rocks and the ""choice"" was the order in which they could be removed). The choice doesn't even need to be about the big story, but it could be something small and meaningful to us, and that in some way changes the world. Right now nothing happens, everything is made of plastic, nothing is truly meaningful except few high quality content between patches.

I have been playing WoW for about 10 years now, and every step of the way I love what Blizzard does with the game! I see so much criticism about the ""future of WoW"", and ""What Blizzard is doing wrong"", but like....take a step back for a moment would you? Look at what they have done for Pete's sake! Blizzard Entertainment has created a community of millions of people that can come together and celebrate their love of this fantasy setting with each other. They have stood the test of time with World of Warcraft for over 15 years! WoW is STILL the MMO titan, reigning champion, to beat in the gaming community!
Just to name a few of my favorite moments in WoW's history that gave me literal chills..
-When Thrall faced off against Garrosh in Draenor for the final time.
- When Arthas asked his father for forgivness with his final words.
- When Illidan chose to stay behind and face the Mad Titan himself, 1v1, in order to save Azeroth.
-When Sylvanas Windrunner, by herself, took out an entire seige tower in order to boost morale and brazen her troops!
- When Saurfang challenged Sylvanus to Mok'Gora, knowing that he could not beat her, but also knowing that by sacrificing his life, all of the Horde would know what she truly is.
That's just to name a few of my absolute favorite moments in WoW's history so far, I have many more. So in conclusion Reddit users, my point is this, yes World of Warcraft may have its problems at times, but the game is still the best of the best, and we, as gamers can be SO overly critical of it.

The light is now showing it's true colors. And now since the main forces of the void is gone, the light is now overtaking Azeroth as the counter. And while the light beliefs that there's only one way and if you don't go that way, you die. It's not so pretty now, is it.

fjo3zx,zrogst,Venting: Pet Battle System Sucks and Here's Why,"I hate Pet battling in WoW.   It is the most frustrating activity currently in the game.  For whatever reason, Blizzard devs feel compelled to tie non-Pet items into the Pet Battle System too - like the new Bug Mount in Assaulted Uldum.    


Why does it suck so bad?  Because it feels unfair every time you lose.  Getting the nasty end of the RNG stick on an 8 minute cooldown isn't fun.  And I don't feel accomplished when I finally beat the daily Pet or Trainer on the umpteenth attempt - because I usually didn't do anything different from the times I lost.  


Part of the issue is the diversity of pets.  There are over a thousand different pets that can battle in the game but the tuning seems to revolve around maybe a dozen of the most used and most overpowered pets.    And when others recommend a pet combination it's further complicated by the ""Breed"" system (which requires an addon to even see.)  Your Unborn Val'kyr is different from theirs because yours is S/S and theirs is S/B or P/B or whatever.  Its needlessly complex.  


Another issue is the *way* over-complicated Strength &amp; Weakness system.  Rock Paper Scissors is fine.  I can remember that Rock beats Scissors.  A Water/Fire/Earth system would have been fine - because it's intuitive that Water beats Fire.  What's not fine is **ten** different types of pets each with their own Bonus AND Weakness to BOTH strike AND defense.  I shouldn't need to refer to a chart.  


As a completionist I feel compelled to participate in Pet Battles dailies and achievements.   Everytime I do - without fail - I want to yeet the entire computer tower out a window.   I'm just here to vent, but if you have suggestions you think I haven't heard for making the battles less RNG or having more fun with the system I'm all ears.",12,1584377589,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fjo3zx/venting_pet_battle_system_sucks_and_heres_why/,wow,1

fjnoyn,ClassicKrova,"Do you think WoW could get away from the ""Daily/Weekly Login Scheme"" design it has relied on for so long?","The things the keep me from enjoying Retail more are all of these systems that make you feel like you ""missed"" something if you didn't play during a particular period.

* In Nazjatar not logging in 1 day set you 1 day behind certain essences and storyline progressions.
* Not playing an Alt for a week causes them to permanently fall behind ""Coalescing Visions"" count, making catching up to cloak levels even more difficult.
* Being offline for 3 days can cause you to miss an ""Emissary Cache"" for a reputation you are currently grinding for one reason or another, setting you back extra few days of progress.


What I don't understand is why these systems don't just work like the Conquest Bar. The Conquest Bar functions like this:

* The first week of the season, there is only 1 Conquest bar to fill. Once you do, you get to pick an item and nothing else for the next week.
* The second week, there is a new Conquest bar for the people who filled the conquest last week.
* People who haven't finished their first Conquest bar can grind through 2 Conquest Bars to ""Catch up"".
* In the end, both players have to put in the same amount of time to grind out 2 Conquest Bars, and they have 2 different ways to accomplish this task using their preferred time management.


I honestly don't see a downside from applying this kind of system EVERYWHERE in WoW. I understand having something new to give players who grinded everything out every day or every week. What I don't understand is permanently setting people who skipped a week off back. I don't understand why these people aren't allowed to come back next week and do 2x as much work that week to make up for the one they missed.

This allows people a healthier range of time management options. I feel like the only system that suffers from applying this is Blizzards ""Daily Login"" metric, which is a SHIT way of tracking success of a game.

fjn90w,RiparianPhoenix,Does anyone have anything positive to say about BfA? Is there anything people will miss or remember fondly about this expansion?,"We all have complaints, criticisms and frustrations about this expansion, but is there anything that we actually like about it? 

I’ve been asking myself this question this last week and I’ve had a hard time coming up with an answer. There are  the obvious praises for the great work the art teams have done, but is there anything else that we can say was about good about this expansion??

I think some of the allied races are cool additions, but then that also leads into the criticisms surrounding the implementation of allied races as a whole and the long wait before some were playable. 

I can also say the raids were mostly pretty good. I liked most of the dungeons. Battle for Dazar Alor was a high light. 

I don’t know what else I can say though. I think Islands, Warfronts and Horrific Visions all had some kernels of interesting ideas to expand the game and give players new activities beyond what we’ve come to expect, but they all have glaring issues. Visions has been the best of the three. It’s provided a fun and satisfying challenge for a few weeks, but it’s not the sort of thing that keeps one interested or excited to come back to for long. 

Can anyone else come up with anything?

fjmzy0,-Shiroyasha-,Shadowlands Alpha Testing Schedule (Draft Idea),"As most of us know, Alpha will be soon approaching and with the expansion having a semi-fixed release date (by the end of 2020), I've been theorizing a reasonable timeline Blizzard may follow to test Shadowlands. The precedence is based on past alpha testing periods with similar expected duration (6-8 months testing period) and is as follows:

**-Phase 1:** *General Features* 

* Pre-patch testing (end of March-end of April) 
* Revamped Level Progression + Profession Systems (April-May/June)
* Class Unpruning (start of May- end of July)

**-Phase 2:** *End-game Features*

* Leveling + End-game Zones, World content, rewards and professions  (end of April - end of August)
   * Bastion, Maldraxxus (end of April)
   * Ardenwald, Revendreth (end of May)
   * The Maw (mid/end of June)
* Torghast + Craftable Legendaries (mid/end of June-early September)
* Covenants + Abilities (May-July)

\-**Phase 3:** *Final bug-testing &amp; QA (September-October)*

\-**Release:** Mid-October-Mid November

Of course, I'm no developer so I can't say I know for sure, but If I were to plan things out as a developer I would do it this way. It would give the team enough time to work on general features, release the pre-patch on time and also have enough resources to test the more important expansion features(torghast, covenants and world content) without too much conflict.

fjku5a,shadowpunkz,Ideas for PvP gearing in the future - Shadowlands maybe?,"I stopped playing in Visions of Nzoth (please correct me if something changed in this period)

**The current situation:**

\-You start the season be receiving ""useless"" gear each week by completing the conquest cap.  
This gear remains useless for 9 weeks...until it starts rewarding you 1800 rated gear by simply completing the weekly conquest cap on week 10. (70 days after the season starts - 2months and 9 days)  
You will then spend the next 6+ weeks gearing up. (note: several months have passed by now)  
Lastly, you enjoy your full set of pvp gear for 2 months before the patch ends.

For this system to make any sense you also have the ""coins"" (forgot the name) you use IF you do rated arena, to upgrade gear.  
Gear from weekly chest is random and only useful if you do rated pvp.

**MY IDEA**

Instead of making us receive ""useless"" gear for months...let us buy pvp gear from a vendor.  
This gear from the vendor will be **as useless as it is NOW for PvE.**  
But make this pieces ""BETTER"" for PvP.  
How?  
Make it increse its level in pvp instances and pvp situations OR give a ""PvP stat"". Your choice.  
This way PvP gearing is NEVER useless.

Then Blizzard can distribute ""tokens"" as they see fit along the next weeks to improve this gear to 1800 rated item level...as they see fit and accordingly.  
Again, this gear is better in PvP instances and situations.

fjielc,FloppyGrandmaTitties,"Here's how I know the next expansion will either be the last one, or will fail to meet expectations","Don't get me wrong, I'm a hardcore world of Warcraft fan and wants for it to survive just as much as anyone else. But you have to acknowledge that world of Warcraft has been diminishing in quality over the past few years. Legion was hit-or-miss for many people. some people love the content itself but hated the stupid artifact power grind which they put back into the game with battle for azeroth, as a necklace, which is much worse. 



But here's how I know the next expansion will be the last one. Their development team is shrinking rapidly, major players on world of Warcraft development team have left, and these are not just average Joes. These are people that is ensured the game was successful... And these people are not being replaced by anyone with a track record of success. They're just filling the position with whoever they can fill it with. You can tell that the people who have fill these positions don't really have their heart in it. So that right there is red flag number one. They are losing people quickly and no one is replacing them. 


Additionally, they are pretty much ignoring all player feedback entirely and not agreeing to make the changes that many players are asking for. This is the big red flag for me. So many players have asked that they reverse what they've done to the classes that make them feel boring and tedious to play. but the thing is, they are instead doubling down on it, removing abilities, simplifying classes dramatically and making classes a laughingstock really. Even worse, they are doubling down on their silly ""daily quests are content"" crusade. Are we trying to make this game Destiny? If so, keep putting daily quests into the game. yes, that's a great idea. Even though every single person who plays this game doesn't want that and thinks it's boring to grind out the same daily quests over and over again. Most people didn't want to come back to battle for azeroth in its prime because there was no content to be played. Login, mythic+ for the weekly chest, do your weekly island expedition, world quests to get the emissary chests, maybe to raid, kthxbai. 



like, I guess this game isn't the most profitable. But come on. at least admit you're going to kill the game off in the next expansion if you're going to ignore every single players feedback",4,1584351889,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fjielc/heres_how_i_know_the_next_expansion_will_either/,wow,1

fjhxau,utkohoc,WoW Flight Simulator,"&amp;#x200B;

![video](nlwszmx6uzm41 ""Introducing World of Warcraft Flight Simulator!"")

**World Of Warcraft Flight Simulator**

The game inside a game nobody asked for. (work in progress)

I got the idea when using the gathering addons with the Routing Addon. it made the UI very much like a flight simulator. I thought, i can make this better...

So i did, i spent hours figuring out how to put gifs into weak aura. Nobody has made a decent guide on it yet and it took a lot of trial and error. I will be putting together a step by step at the bottom of this post.  (big shout out to Weak aura dev  u/Infus  for the guides on YT and the forums)

Addons:

* GatherMate 2
* GatherMate 2 data
* Routing
* Weak auras 2
* Weak auras 2 stop motion
* Sexymap

(maybe some more, will be updating)

&amp;#x200B;

Various gifs and sound files. 

Various macros.  


ill work on a guide and get all the gifs and sound files uploaded at some point, it still needs a lot of work. i want to add a more functional radar over the map (not minimap) , add the addon minimap alert with custom sound files. add a machine gun (cant find any bullets/a10 brrrt gifs)   
add more custom fighter jet radio chatter/sounds. Fighterjet gifs as custom Enemy unit frames.  


UI overlay for various flying mount selections, like a character selection but with flying mounts lined up, custom UI/HUD overlay for each mount. Actual minigame added with enemy and score board (no idea)  


All in all it makes the zin grind a lot less tedious.  


**Making Gifs in wow/weakaura.**

A. **get** [**https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2**](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2)

B. get [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-stop-motion](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-stop-motion)

C. get [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info18810-Blpc.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info18810-Blpc.html)  


1. open [https://ezgif.com/resize](https://ezgif.com/resize)
2. open [https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite](https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite)
3. open [https://giphy.com/](https://giphy.com/) (or whatever u want for gifs)  


go to 3. choose the gif you want. save gif to PC. 

upload gif to 1. and resize it to a number that ends 2, 4, 6, or 8. width and height must be dvisible by 2 and not be 0. (0 seems to work sometimes, not sure.)  


save gif to ur PC. Upload resized gif to 2. gif to sprite sheet. 

settings: CUSTOM GRID. 

columns: quick math. if your gif has 9 frames, 3 columns x 3 rows = 9 frames. you want to try keep it pretty square. not sure how important this is. 

check no margin around outside

output PNG

tile size: leave on auto, it should make something with the correct 2,4,6,8 final number maybe a 0. but should work. if ur final tile size ends in an odd number it most likely will not display correctly. 

**CONVERT**  
you should end up with a nice tile of your favorite meme. Save it as a PNG.

open the C. (Blpc) file converter after u install it. File&gt;open&gt;(select all files in bottom right box so u can find ur PNG) open the png of the split gif. in Blpc make sure in options that Dxt3 is selected and resize method is stretch.  


save your BLP texture file. wow loves BLP files. put the BLP file into your wow interface folder , i like to put them in ""D:\\World of Warcraft\\World of Warcraft\\\_retail\_\\Interface\\Addons\\WeakAurasStopMotion\\Textures\\Basic"" with all his BLP friends.   


Launch WoW, (every time u add a new gif/BLP to the wow interface folder u must restart wow for it to work.)

open up the WA interface (/wa) and click new aura and click stop motion. in the display tab click texture and manualy enter in the address for the BLP file. in my case its ""Interface\\Addons\\WeakAurasStopMotion\\Textures\\Basic\\johntravoltameme.BLP"" do not include anything preceeding \_retail\_ it should start from interface and go on, include the file extension or not, (.blp/.tga) not sure if it matters.   
Custom foreground, u must select the correct amount of rows and columns and the amount of frames in the gif. so 3 by 3 and 9 frame count. Frame rate you can adjust to what u wantdepending what the gif is.   


and that should do it! the gif usually wont play automatically on screen with /wa open. if your gif is sliding around or not working, you have the wrong pixel size and need to resize/check your gif and splitsheets. and check your columns and rows and frame counts.   
as for the triggers, events, conditions, i am not going to explain how all of weak aura works, i hardly know myself. plenty of guides online to help with that.

fjaukr,The_Scarecrows,"We’ve been Waldup for far too long, or: How 1431 Forsaken Footsoldiers stood between me and my Powerfully Stupid bank alt.","Sometimes in the pursuit of beauty, humans become blind to the agonies of their craft. And sometimes World of Warcraft players do really stupid shit for almost no reason. This story is closer to the latter. This is the story of Waldup the Worgen, the most unlikely of bank alts. 

At the end of February, I finally earned the [Brutosaur](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163042/reins-of-the-mighty-caravan-brutosaur). Go me! But the thing with the Brutosaur is that if you’re standing in one of the traditional trade hubs, beside an Auction House, you’re wasting that five million gold. No, we need to find somewhere with glitz. 

Before my longboi I was parked in Booty Bay which, in my opinion, is probably the best hub for auction alts. There’s a bank, a guild bank, an auction house, and a mailbox all within strafing distance of each other, and a vendor a short walk away. The major downside is it isn’t a resting zone, which means every single time you want to change toons there’s a 20-second wait. Yawn. I had a dinosaur now, I could do better. 

I moved to outside the bank in Darnassus, which is definitely a good hub. There’s a mailbox, there’s both banks, you’re in a rested zone. If you have the brutosaur,  I strongly recommend this spot. But… it was lacking something. Darnassus. *Darnassus*. I killed spiders outside Darnassus in 2006. There’s no mystique to Darnassus, no uniqueness. We can do better. 

I realised that all I *really* needed was a mailbox and a convenient rest zone, and that opened up my potential roosts to almost anywhere my little alt could rest their head. For a minute I was in Dun Morogh for nostalgia factor, but when that wore off I got a friend to fly me over to Twilight Highlands, where the baby griffons roam. This was the life. ..There was a mailbox, a convenient resting zone, and a great soundtrack. I was often the only person in the zone, and the views were fantastic. And I could pet the baby griffons.

But then I got enough liquid gold again to start flipping materials, and with 200 000 tidespray linen in my mailbox and bags, I was beginning to realise that 5 minutes of bank access every hour really wasn’t cutting it. I needed a banker, and the search was on again. 

It was hard to get excited about the locations presented on the list of in-game bankers. 

Darnassus, Ironforge, Stormwind, Exodar? Phtth. Boring. Blasé blasé. 

Shattrath, Dalaran? Good options, for sure, but I’d need to twist one of my level 60/80+ toons into a bank alt, and I didn’t have a great candidate for that at the time. 

Booty Bay, Gadgetzan, Ratchet, Winterspring? The best candidates yet for sure, but awkward rest zones and mediocre visuals made them imperfect. 

It seemed my search was doomed, until one innocuous NPC caught my eye.

Mary Oxworth, a &lt;Banker&gt; so useless and unknown that the top google results for her are 5 NPC database links and 1 piece of Genn Greymane/Darius Crowley erotic AU fan fiction. You see, Mary is a banker in the Worgen starting zone, but she only exists in two instances. The first is for a period of about five quests after you’ve been worgen-ed but before the Cataclysm happens, and the second is a little later on in a different city in Gilneas. 

She was my lighthouse.

I flew my bank alt to both her locations but no dice, she was phased out of existence. Not to be dissuaded, I made a new worgen toon. This is the origin of that fair wolf-man, Waldup. Doomed to the Worgen’s curse, and also doomed to a bunch of other really stupid curses he didn’t sign up for. 

Getting Waldup out of Gilneas City and to Duskhaven, to Mary Oxworth, was simple enough. The problems thereafter began immediately. You see, the quests in the Worgen starting zone get you to around level 5, and then the Cataclysm happens and Ms. Oxworth makes a break for higher ground. We can’t have that. To give you an idea of how poorly I planned this entire escapade out, I forgot that I wouldn’t be able to actually mount the brutosaur until I got mount training at level 20. Oops. 

Not to worry, I’m sure I can leave the Worgen starting zone in this phase and come back to it when I’m the right level. No dice once again. The instance is blocked in with invisible walls, and although you can glitch out and free yourself, or get a warlock summon, I was worried that phasing shenanigans would infringe upon my ability to return to my One True Love, Ms. Oxworth. 

Instead, I developed a new plan. 

At first I thought I would DoubleAgent this, picking up herbalism and mining in an attempt to earn xp. While you could definitely do that, the instance in this case is very small, and the nodes are scarce. That wasn’t going to cut it. 

I began to farm Forsaken Footsoldiers. Blessedly, I soon realised that Gilneas had been updated with the new level-scaling, and they levelled up with me. I ran in a circle through the fields of Duskhaven, picking flowers and mining veins and killing Forsaken Footsoldiers. 

I reached level 6. And then level 7.

I earned my Imp. I earned my specialisation. Shadow Bolt became Incinerate. I had killed so many goddam Footsoldiers.  I earned my first talent point.

At level 15 I thought I would finally be free, finally able to random-queue into dungeons and level myself that way.

[Things did not proceed as planned.](https://imgur.com/a/6EB5X0f.png)

I knew what I had to do. At this point my Routes addon was freaking out, totally unable to discern what zone I was even in, and WoW’s in-game statistics broke as well. The Forsaken Footsoldiers were still earning me experience but the game was no longer iterating my ‘total kills that grant experience of honor’ stat. 

I continued on. Killing, killing, picking, mining, killing. I began to feel bad for them. Then I killed some more.

[When I mined that last copper node, when I hit level 20, I had killed somewhere just upwards of 1400 Forsaken Footsoldiers over the course of 8 hours of cumulative /played.](https://imgur.com/a/fWBrNE0.png)

[Waldup the Worgen finally stood proud, mounted on his Brutosaur…](https://i.imgur.com/OcVSn07.png)

[... and at long last reunited with his raison d'être.](https://i.imgur.com/sfBd4LF.png)

Can I recommend this path? Absolutely not. To be blunt, it’s not even a better commercial hub than Darnassus, and probably isn’t better than Booty Bay. Do I regret doing it? Absolutely not. I think I’m one of the only players in the game whose retail bank-alt exists canonically preceding the Cataclysm. A core joy of the game is self-direction, and [grinding](https://youtu.be/0RxQRswLAmI?t=2065) is the ultimate-self directed activity, particularly when it works towards an otherwise non-incentivised goal. To put it flatly, I had fun doing this. It was fun. 

Lastly, to those against whom I competed on the auction house over the past months, take rest. The reign of Gnimrod the Gnome Hunter, terror of economics, is over.

fj79z7,Vealzy,What if the LFR version of a raid released at the end of the tier not at the start?,"Hello everyone, so I was talking to a friend about past expansion and about cool stuff we did.

At one point I was telling him about what a newbie I was back in Wrath and how I farmed rep for two months inside ICC and just stared at Lord Marrowgar without being able to get in a group for him. Then, one night, I managed to get in a group and I finally got to fight him and it was so cool, we went on to kill 4 bosses that night and it was one of the best gaming nights ever.

Now, with the introduction of LFR, cool things like that never happen because everyone can just queue and see all the bosses. 

So I was thinking, what if the LFR version of a raid releases when the following raid releases. So LFR Uldir comes with the release of BoD, LFR BoD with the release of EP and so on with the last raid of a expansion having its LFR released with the pre-patch for the next expansion.

I think this would be a good change for two reasons. Firstly, it will incentivize people to try and make more groups for normal and heroic as that will be the only wait to experience the raid until next patch. Secondly, it will help with power inflation by removing a 15 ilvl bump that the current system requires.

I mean in my opinion they should just remove LFR completely, but I feel like this would be a good compromise. So what do you guys think about it, would you like this change to LFR or you prefer it as it is now?",30,1584301745,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fj79z7/what_if_the_lfr_version_of_a_raid_released_at_the/,wow,1

fj6qii,FloppyGrandmaTitties,"I would play this game again if it were free to play, or lower cost","The development team to this game has shrunk dramatically over the years. That's evident to me. what's more evident is that they also don't listen to The players, but that's a separate issue entirely. There are in my opinion far more Superior games in terms of value out there that you can play today. for example, Elder scrolls is free-to-play, and has hundreds upon hundreds of hours of content and you don't ever have to spend a dime. This game doesn't really have that much content and you have to pay $15 for it. When I say doesn't have that much content, I guess I mean fun content, or content you'd want to repeat and do over again. It's only so fun doing a mythic dungeon The first 30 times or so. Not three hundred. The same goes for raids as well because of how hard they are to put together.

fj6djm,TTV_Bellson,Re-evaluate how gear is distributed,"I'm sure plenty of people are going to hate this post but, frankly, I don't care because this is a real problem that needs to be addressed in my opinion.   


I am a returning player (last played in Legion) who just got to 120 and am trying to gear up for end game content.  I have reached, what feels like, a gear barrier at around ilvl430.  This does not come as a surprise because I have seen the same behaviors from players in every expansion dating back to the dawn of Gear Score / Ilvl.  


Battlegrounds and PVP used to be a great way to obtain gear back when you had the flexibility of choosing what pieces you purchased with Honor and Conquest points.  As a returning player who came back at the end of an expansion, even trying BGs with less than 450 ilvl is a waste of time.  You are a burden on your team and lose the overwhelming majority of your matches as a result.  Stack that on top of my Battlegroups 20 minute horde queues, it's worthless.  


I figured I'd be able to jump into some dungeons and get some gear, but as soon as I topped my gear out from Mythic 0s (which took forever because nobody runs them anymore) I can't get a group together for Mythic+.  Applying to groups is like applying to jobs these days.  unless you are hilariously overqualified, nobody wants you.  There are just too many people with better gear looking to do the same garbage content.  This is nothing new to WoW.  People always want to get carried by those who already have gear pulled from the content in which they are in. 

As a result, I find myself running in circles around Org, waiting for 30 minute BG queue pops and applying to dozens of dungeon runs and not actually playing the game...  


So how do I suggest Blizzard fixes these problems.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) PVP Balance - Take out all gear from the equation of non-rated content.  Assign baseline stats to all classes.**

**2) PVP Queues - Let Horde teams play against other Horde teams.  Nobody cares about the lore of this game anymore.  This entire expansion was predicated on holding hands with the opposing faction while leveling.  Don't let population imbalances decide how long it takes to play the content.** 

**3) PVP Rewards - For the love of god, bring back Honor vendors.  I made the mistake of picking up a healing staff for my first PVP weapon and am now getting forced into a DPS role based on guild requirements.  I have no good way to get a second weapon short of RNGing my way into one in a Weekly dungeon run or a Weekly Conquest chest**   


**4) PVE Reset Timers - Remove the weekly resets on Mythic dungeons.  Mythic dungeons are just the new heroic dungeons... I get that you are trying to stretch the life of your content out, but don't punish people who want to play more with both Loot Box RNG AND Weekly resets.**  


**5) Scaling PVE Content - Dynamically adapt basic mythic dungeon content and rewards based on the average ilvl of a group.  Blizz managed to implement this in the early game dungeons (to a degree) by effectively stat balancing everything and providing rewards.  That way, an ilvl 430 can jump in a dungeon with some of his fresh 120 friends and still be able to get some rewards for the effort included.**

Is there are reason they only want me to experience other specs once per week?

fj4xiy,MosesKarada,What is the point of LFR currently?,"Originally, LFR was set up so that more players can see content and get a chance at higher illvl loot than available in the world.

Well, now you can quite easily get loot in WQ's of much higher ilvl so it's really just down to ""seeing content."" The essence drops, the quest completions, they are significantly and painfully longer than other modes. Which is fair because it's a fast queue. At least we get a shot at it.

But what I truly don't get is if we're doing LFR *only* to see the content, why is there any difficulty to the fights? I know you're going to respond with ""lmao, it's so easy."" And yes, compared to heroic/mythic I'm sure it is. But you're in a group with 24 unknowns with little to no communication. I'm not doing these things for a challenge. I'm not doing it to build friendships with these people that will leave after one wipe. I'm doing this to get in, get my weekly chores done and get out. I feel like I should be able to sneeze and N'zoth falls over. 

As I type this, I'm sitting at 6 stacks of determination on N'zoth with several wipes that didn't meet the cut to gain additional stacks. People are saying that their prior kills got up to 12-15. The reward does not feel remotely worth it to keep doing it beyond one kill for quest completion.

I used to be a mythic raider and hardcore progression, but I've gotten older have less time to raid and less desire to do so. Now to get content, it's pretty much LFR at this point. Which means do it once because its not enjoyable or rewarding enough to do again.",14,1584293360,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fj4xiy/what_is_the_point_of_lfr_currently/,wow,1

The last few weeks my computer has frozen while playing wow. I am using 2 screens with wow on one and HBO on the other, which has worked well in the past. 

However, lately my computer just freezes after a few minutes in the game and I need to turn it off with the button.. I thought I found the solution when I realised that it started when I downloaded the tsm application but even after uninstalling it this happens. Today it’s even worse, it usually stops after the first manual restart but now I’m at my third time trying to restart the computer in 1 hour.. 

I realise that this could be due to many different factors that are hard to tell but does anybody have any idea what it could be or a tip that I could try? Been away a few days and I just want to relax and play some wow..

fizsco,yulhonatin,"Does anyone else struggle with people, even while playing wow? How do you do activities that require teamwork, like m+ and raiding?","Communication for me is hard, especially one on one conversations. I have a speech impediment so I don't like to talk very much. It's hindered my actual life as much as in game relationships. I also find myself struggling with picking up new information, adapting to major changes is exhausting. I have to spend more time in game trying to figure things out than everyone else but once I can understand something no one else will come close to my performance. There are also somethings I'll never understand no matter how much time I put into them, friendship is one of these things.

When I started playing wow, I stuck with the first guild that would play with me, even if I didn't get along with everyone, and stayed for 3 years. Over all that time, I never managed to make any personal connections with anyone, aka no reliable friends. People would fight and argue with each other over nothing, I never understood how they thought they were prepared for mythic raiding.

Half way through the last tier, a few core members quit and with that a divide in the guild was born. I sensed the death of the guild so I chose to leave a few weeks after that, shortly after the guild disband. From there, I hopped between a few end game guilds who had cleared the raid to build more experience and get better at my spec. Sadly, I didn't like how they exploited their trials and newer members while making millions from carries. Since then, I chose to ignore the community parts of the game and create my own form of fun, that was until I saw the limited time rewards from M+ coming in 8.3. I wanted to get back into the game, even if it was to only complete the +15 achievements, but I didn't have logs or raiding exp from this expansion to back myself up. It almost felt like I was trying to fill out a job application instead of play a video game, it's awkward as hell.

So in November, I decided to look for a guild because I didn't want to pug my way through everything. I joined a guild on my main spec but they wanted me to play something completely new. Something I hadn't touched before but I was interested in for a long time. They assured me experience and skill wasn't required as they said they'd help me as much as possible and gear wouldn't be a concern. That wasn't as honest as they led on. It was like I was stepping right back into the same atmosphere as my first guild, people were arguing about nothing, there was an extreme amount of shit talking behinds peoples backs, core members chose not to show up to raid, newer members were never included if they didn't have the ilvl of the older members, the list goes on. For a month I kept trying to get core members to run M+ with me so I could gear myself up but I was treated like an inconvenience to others when I asked for help. Only the GM and his officers would take me through M+ runs and I was never able to get past 430 all while the rest of the guild was 450. I quit that guild a few weeks after 8.3 launched and they've lost half of their members since.


**So here's my question**, what's the point of inviting someone into a guild if you're going to tell them to pug everything and play by themselves? If someone is online 8+ hours a day and is actively trying to get better at their spec, why wouldn't you want to help them improve? I can't understand how people play this game and act like that towards one another, it's childish. Is that how every guild treats each other? All I want is a place I can fit in with and play the game with others but everyone wants to stab each other in the back over pixels.",13,1584270596,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fizsco/does_anyone_else_struggle_with_people_even_while/,wow,1

fiws7k,UnholyLucio,My best interaction on this game with strangers so far,"I wanted to share something that happend to me today (i'm from South America, so i'm sorry for my english)

  

So i was on an alt doing uldum’s assault, about to kill that leader of the assault. This alt is a bit new, so I don’t have the ideal dps and all, but I tried to solo the thing regardless… spoiler alert: I couldn’t… I dropped it to 35% and I almost died, so I ran away and reset it, healed back up and waited until someone came.  
 A couple of seconds passed and this Female Belf paladin came and started attacking the thing, I saw her health, just to know if she was able to kill it, she was on tank spec, so she could but I might took her a while, so I jumped it with all my cd and helped her kill it, making sure I don’t hit her with aoe to let her know I wanted to help.  
 We kill it, then she thanked me, got mounted and was about to fly away, that’s when I used “/wait” and “/beg” to try to communicate I wanted to kill that thing and that I needed help, she got the message and was going to wait with me right on the spawn point.  
 Meanwhile, this Male Belf Ret Paladin and this Tauren Blood DK arrived at the scene looking to kill the thing and they saw me trying to communicate with this FBelf and the MBelf stunned me and just looked at me, trying to see if I would run/fight/idk, then the DK started to attack and cc me. This alt is a monk, so I used all my mobility to kite them because I saw that FBelf wasn’t attacking and was just watching me.  
 So I was kiting those 2, and then the FBelf talked to them, idk what he said to them, but that MBelf stopped attacking, and the DK was just chasing but with less killing intentions  
 Then the leader spawned back again and by that time, 2 more horde players arrived, so I backed slowly and let them kill the thing and they left, except for the FBelf, who stood and was willing to tank the thing for me.  
 Another couple of seconds later, a 5-men Alliance Group arrived, there was a mage, 2 rogues and idk what else, one of those rogues used sap on the Horde paladin and the mage used poly too, so I ran and stood between them and my horde friend and told them to not harm him/her, the other rogue stunned him/her and I did the same, they told me they were sorry for trying to harm my friend and just stayed there to kill the leader with me, then I waved and bowed (pandaren monk, I had to) at this FBelf and we all left  
 I don’t remember your name but I know you are from a South America server, just like me  
 We always get discriminated for being toxic or just bad at the game, but those players who discriminate, just ran into the wrong ppl, there are assholes and awesome players everywhere  
 so, if you are reading this, I want you to know for helping me get out of that situation and for letting me get you out of trouble, I love you… and think you are awesome

fiwoc6,arturoaliev,Which Legion Mythic+ dungeon you loved/hated most and why?,"I miss Legion dungeons, I think it would be fun to see them return to Mythic+ arena! If we had a time walking event with one highlighted Legion dungeon several months in a year that would be a breath of fresh air from BfA routine!

I remember Maw of Souls being the most speedrunned dungeon, but damn, Helya was punishing and demanded high responsibility from each player.

Trial of Valor Odin felt unkillable on Tyrannic, with an ocean of HP, but ToV trash packs became a death machine on Fortified.

Neltharion's Lair and Val'Sharah one felt most balanced, and I had a blast storming through them. Hated the totem gamble though.

Don't ever talk to me about Eye of Azshara. That shithole was so packed with mobs, having Necrotic, Bursting, Teeming, Fortified there meant a world of pain for everyone. For some groups Tyrannic Wrath of Azshara became an unbreachable wall, wiped on him so many times. And don't forget goddamn winds and lightnings, that always tossed your ass around.

Vault of Wardens was quite polarising experience. At lower keys Cordana mechanics you could just cheese through, but the higher you get, the more demanding she became. I hated that place because I died all the time, but after me and my buddies went there for achievement run, I mastered the fight, and had little trouble after. If you do it with experienced people, it was quite fun to run!

Archway and Court of Stars. CoS trash was notorious and been a cause of so many wipes. I think it was a fun gimmick, that you can poison boss, stack up on nice buffs, that DHs and Pallys can cheese spy stage, but meta for that place became so toxic real fast, groups always looking for demon hunters and rogues and certain professions. Demonic lady and last boss were also hard to kill, with those winds, constant party-wide AoE, and edgy remarks, that you kept hearing over and over and over after many wipes.

Arcway was fun, a lot of squishy trash, reasonable bosses, and the sweetest trinket, that forced you to run that place many times, first to get at least base version, then to improve it, then get a socketed version!

Sadly I quit before Nighthold was out, and missed on Anthorus dungeon completely, nothing to say there.

I did Karazhan on hardmode, when we barely had gear to survive Nightbane pools, but haven't seen it in mythic, I think that dungeon, especially first part, was amazing in Mythic+! Would love to hear how it went for you!

What was your experience, and which dungeon would you like to see a return? I think Neltharion's Lair, Vault or one of the Suramar ones!",33,1584250892,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fiwoc6/which_legion_mythic_dungeon_you_lovedhated_most/,wow,1

fiuy8p,dekranos,Why Moon Guard is the best server on World of Warcraft,"I know, I know, a lot of you are just going to scroll past this and chuckle based solely off the title. Hear me out, I do have a reason for this astoundingly bold statement. I believe that Moon Guard is the best server on WoW, this is why. 


           I started WoW a LONG time ago. It was an era of RPG elements, actually dying from mobs, and real, genuine friendship. It was Wrath of the Lich King, which in my opinion was the greatest expansion of the game. My opinion on that is for a different time. So let's get real here, down to the dirty stuff. World of Warcraft is a single player game now, IF YOU SO CHOOSE. Let's be honest and forthcoming about another thing here, most people are to lazy or just out right don't want to be social anymore, especially since they have the option. This is the straw that broke the camel's back. WoW was a game that made introverted people become an extrovert and social personality from the comfort of their own make-shift computer chair back in 2004. This does not exist anymore. This is what made the game so great, the sense of community, friendship, and bonding that we all HAD TO HAVE. WoW is a game that introverts can stay non-social throughout it's entirety now. Here is where Moon Guard comes in. Yes, we have all seen the horrors and atrocious acts of vile sexual activity that goes on in Goldshire. Do not be afeared, for this is not the real Moon Guard. I made my character, Aitnaa, a Tauren hunter, with a lot of curiosity and cautiousness about the server. I was astounded at what I had discovered. I found community, player made RPG elements, friendship, bonding, it was magical. I found a guild, and I KNOW THE PEOPLE IN IT. I made friends while questing, and I mean friends. Like, they waved at me or buffed me when we crossed paths again. I had never seen such since pre-Cataclysm WoW. It was a magical anomaly that proved itself real. I found immersion in the game because of the sincere and deep roleplayers that actually took the lore of the world seriously, I found people that cared about the state of the game, I found intense and hardcore raiders, I found PvPers, World PvPers, RPers, the list goes on. Moon Guard encompasses all that was the World of Warcraft that we fell in love with. I'm going to leave this short article open-ended so that you all can think on it, discover it for yourself. Do it. Make that dwarf warrior and hangout in Ironforge. Make that Tauren druid and become your character again.

Since I was planning on teaching about Avatars, Virtual Worlds &amp; Escapism anyway, I decided to do next Monday's class inside World of Warcraft, the game I grew up playing and a perfectly relevant example of the stuff I want to talk about in my class.

**I wanted to do more than just a livestream so I've asked my students to create a trial account and meet me in Durotar at the Orc Starter Zone on Maghteridon EU on Monday.**

As many WoW-ers will probably echo, World of Warcraft is all about the community and to show that fundamental principle to my students I wanted to ask the wonderful people of /r/wow if they could join us and maybe even share their fond memories of this game.  

I know it's a bit of an atypical request, but I think it could be fun and especially insightful for my students. 

So anyone who's eager to join can join us here:

**Server:** Magtheridon EU  
**Area:** Orc Starter Zone  
**Time**: 14h00 (GMT +1) 

I'm planning on streaming it on [my Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/voidwalkereu) so feel free to join and participate there as well!

Is there anything that would prevent developers from implementing a system that would slightly increase the chances of desirable items to drop from bosses based on mechanics and how players handle them?

 If a player gets hit by an avoidable mechanic the odds that an item good for them would drop decrease, but if they aren't hit then it increases. Nothing huge, but enough to make a difference. The same could apply to mechanics that need to be sought out/soaked. It could be based on role as well since there are mechanics that tanks cannot avoid, ones that target specific roles, and I'm sure a whole bunch of other outlier scenarios.

fio062,ArielsaWoW,Tell me your story about an in-game friend,"I was thinking today that I wish I had some in-game friends like in the old days. I don't know why, but I've been playing almost exclusively solo since Cata and was just missing the social aspect so it got me thinking about the people I've met over the years.

I guess my story that I will share is about a guy that I met when I first started playing. It was probably 2006. I was just a young whipper-snapper then. I remember I would always try to get people to run me through ""VC"" for like 1 gold  (which in hindsight is super not worth it), but a hunter named Lashout took pity on me. In the couple runs I had done previously, I had always been run through by max level players and I recall that he wasn't too much higher level than the mobs in the instance and I thought we would struggle, but I'll be darned if he wasn't the best of all of them. He kept me from dying and must have run me through 5 times. When I tried to give him my meager amount of gold, he refused, and I was just so appreciative. He told me to add him and when he would see me on he would often ask me if I wanted to be run through something or other and we would chat about this and that. It was almost like having a real friend.  


I never told him, but I was being abused at home and life was a real struggle at the time and I just didn't feel like I had anyone in my life to care about me or to look up to. It's actually making me emotional thinking back about how much that gesture meant to me. Those small gestures can change or (as in my case) save a life. Over the years I've looked him up from time to time, but I can't even remember what server it was on. I just hope that wherever Lashout is, life is going as good for him as one of his run-throughs did for me.",10,1584214238,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fio062/tell_me_your_story_about_an_ingame_friend/,wow,1

finh82,Magic1264,Solutions to kicked pug raiders,"As someone who does a lot of pick up raids, it is not uncommon for  an individual or group to fail for a variety of reasons. Now of course, I understand getting kicked from a pug raid, after you've invested any time and energy in getting the kill, sucks a lot, and I can even understand the nerd rage//temper tantrum that follows, pulling bosses onto the raid in hopes of driving up some repair bills on unsuspecting victims (for not getting a pay off on that time//energy investment).

However, I don't understand what to do about these persons when their tantrum goes on for 5-10 minutes. My understanding is that their instance kick timer gets reset whenever they pull the boss, and if they don't die//stay in range of the boss, they can continue can soft prevent the group from moving forward//setting up an adequate pull.

Now, obviously I report these individuals whenever I get the chance, but is there anything that can be done with a more immediate solution, aside from zoning//disbanding reforming (which, in a pug group, is a monumental task to say the least)",7,1584212353,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/finh82/solutions_to_kicked_pug_raiders/,wow,1

fin1rb,digitaldave71,Priests - stay Holy or switch to Disc?,"I started levelling a priest last weekend, and went holy. I’ve been levelling solely in dungeons, and so far it’s been quite fun and interesting, except when the tank thinks we are on a timer mythic+ run and pulls too many packs and a boss at the same time. However, I’m only level 55 so far, and it’s not been massively challenging, and I find myself just casting renew and spamming heal / flash heal with the occasional other spell thrown in to suit circumstances, and use smite etc to fill the time. 

1) Would it be worth switching to Disc to give more variety and getting offensive spells that hit a bit harder than a wet noodle? My concern is that it would be a completely different play style to Holy. 

2) Do thing start getting more challenging at higher levels?

fig3r2,GeNeReDeR,"Chromie time community instead of shadowlands - WoW ""every old expansion"" classic confirmed?","I just watched a great youtube video by soulsobreezy who explains how the level squish in shadowlands will really work. As far as my understanding goes ""chromie time"" is confirmed which means level 10-50 is a leveling bracket where all content before shadowlands scales with your character and only when you knowingly break ""chromie time"" your character is able to enter shadowlands, gain EP after lvl 50 and all old content scales down to lvl35.

This basicly means its possible to form a ""chromie time only"" community with the release of shadowlands where a whole server is dominated by players who willingly only play chromie time, basicly making this server a ""wow every old expansion at the same time classic"" with automated scaling to 50, raiding every old raid together for example, grinding a combination of old gear of different expansions which will all be ""equally endgame"" to them.

fi96xy,canis_dingo,My thoughts on trial accounts.,"So I'm sure this has been suggested before, but I think they should make trial accounts go up to the previous Xpac (currently Legion).

In my opinion, this would get a lot of people who look at wow and say ""meh, I might like it, but I'm not gonna pay for a subscription to take 3 months getting to endgame and find out I don't like the game."" This would allow them to actually see if they like the game, not just the first 3 zones. At level 20 there is absolutely no way to know if you'll like playing at level 120; but at level 110, you'd have a decent idea.

I was having this debate with a friend, and he said Blizzard would make less money. I have 2 arguments to this. 1.) I honestly think it would bring more subs to the game. 2.) They'd still have access to the MTX shop. They'd still be buying realm xfers and faction changes. Hell, even sell 110 boost for $30 or something. I really think Blizz could and would figure something out.

TL;DR: Make all previous xpacs f2p, let people experience more than just the first hour of gameplay.",45,1584142714,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fi96xy/my_thoughts_on_trial_accounts/,wow,1

fi8c5n,-Shiroyasha-,Prestige Classes Next Expansion,"With Blizzard recently shifting towards class focus in Shadowlands and the recent speculation of a potential Dragon Isles expansion all I could think of was Prestige Classes. At this point, we have 12 classes and its 36 specs. But, by moving to a more class-based focus, Blizzard could offer prestige for each class depending on your alignment with each dragon aspect and this would unlock a set of 3 abilities that would significantly change your class's play style as well as unique skins for your class's class abilities (i.e.; polymorph switches from a sheep to a red dragon). I know it would be difficult to add 3 abilities across 12 classes, but, when you look at other games like overwatch and Dota II there is so much room for inspiration when it comes to designing interactive abilities.

fi6cwk,OldSchoolPredsFan,These Are Some Changes I Think WoW Desperately Needs To Make,"1. Reputation: 
 * I'm fine with locking stuff behind reputation grinds. I understand that. However, I think reputation should be account-based or faction-based reputation at the very least. 
 * Having reputation be with individuals characters discourages people from having ults. If I play half-way through an expansion with a Worgen Rogue and decide I want to try out a Gnome Mage instead I will have to re-grind all the reputation. So I don't try out the new character.
 * Similarly, it punishes people who have ults. If I play through one expansion's content with a Troll Shaman and play through a different expansion's content with an Orc hunter and a different expansion with a Blood-elf Monk, I have to go through all of my characters and see which one has the most rep built up with the group whose faction I'm wanting to grind. It's ult hopping. It's obnoxious.

2. Daily Quests/World Quests: 
 * I'm paying Blizzard to play this game. I should be able to play it how I want. If I want to spend 12 hours a day grinding reputation for ""The Anglers"" I should be allowed to do that. I shouldn't be limited to 3 Daily Quests. It's absolutely absurd to limit it.
 * The same with World Quests. I understand WoW might want to limit the number of World Quests in one area per day for the latest expansion's content to pad out the length of time it takes people to play through it, but at least take off the limit to old expansion content. 

3. Dungeons/Raids:
 * I don't think there should be a limit on the number of times you can clear a raid or dungeon, particularly if it's old content. Again, I'm paying to play this game. If all I wanted to do was run 1 raid over and over and over again I should be allowed to. Limiting the number of times you can do new expansion raids and dungeons is fine, but old content should have no restrictions. 


4. Questing:
 * There should be no limit on the number of quests you can pick up. I'm so sick and tired of having my quest log be full. At the very list, if you are going to limit the number of quests you can pick up, limit it per zone. And for the love of Christ tell me the number of quests I have and how many I can pick up until my quest log is full. 
 * Quests in the quest log need much greater context and organization. When you pick up a quest it should have more info. It should tell you the quest chain that the quest is a part of, what expansion it takes place in, maybe where that quest is in the chain quests (or which quest preceded that one if they are part of a bigger quest chain), the zone the quest is in, where the quest is in the zone, etc. Give the quests from each expansion a unique color and make each quest marker related to the expansion that color. So you can at a glance know what expansion that quest is a part of. Right now, before I pick up a quest I have to run to Wowhead and type it in and then navigate their website to try and figure out what this quest is and whether I should do it.
 * Quests shouldn't pop up if they are going to ruin the story or if you haven't finished the quests that take place before it. Trying to play through BFA's content has been an absolute nightmare. I'm playing quests out of order, quests will pop up talking about events that I haven't played through, I'll start what seems like a big part of the story and it will just drop and I'll have nothing left to do. The BFA story has been so disjointed and out of order for me. It's been terrible. For Example: [Spoiler](/s ""I had one quest that had a cut scene with Baine Bloodhoof standing next to Anduin in the throne room in Stormwind. I had no idea why he was there. Then the next day I played a mission where he was in prison in Orgrimmar and we had to break him out. Then that same day I got a cut scene for Ashjara and quested in there for a little bit and then I went back to Borealus and a quest popped up that said ""Now that we defeated Ashzara..."" when I hadn't even defeated her yet or faced her."")
 * The fact that Wowhead is a necessity to play this game is ridiculous, but it is and I'm thankful the website exists. Blizzard can pick any quest in the game, search it on WoWhead, and look in the comments of that quest to find problems with it to fix. There are so many quests that have problems it's ridiculous.

5. Flying:
 * I know people here might not agree with this one, but locking off flying so that you essentially have to play through an entire expansion's content before you unlock flying in that zone is absurd. When flying would be most useful is when you are playing through the expansion, not once you're done with it. I just don't get it. It's like once you unlock flying in an area there is nothing left to do there except maybe grind rep.

fi4urk,SpooderRain,"Discussion: Imagining a death knight ""fire"" spec","It's pretty much confirmed that a 4th death knight spec is ***not*** going to happen but just for fun how would you imagine a ""fire"" spec for death knights? Here's my ~~wet~~ dry &amp; toasty dream of how it would be implemented. And yeah this is a wall of text, it's a class so should be expected.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro**

First of all ""fire"" as a name is a bit boring and mages already have it so what about ""Ember"" or ""Cinder""? Also to differentiate it from ""fire"" as something very different.

**Ember;**  *""a small piece of burning or glowing coal or wood in a* ***dying*** *fire""* 

**Cinder;**  *""a small piece of partly burnt coal or wood that has stopped giving off flames but still has combustible matter in it""*

Leaning towards ""Ember"" as a fitting name, a dying flame. So that would make the new spec line-up for death knight: **Unholy, Frost, Blood** and **Ember**.

So what should the spec be about? Wow is in dire need of more healing classes so a healing spec would be nice, also fitting if it would pull some fantasy from the red dragon-flight with their life giving flames without losing the macabre of the death knight class. But since a pure healing spec for a death knight does not really fit the class it's going to be one of the dps healing hybrids but introduced in a new way.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Ember Death Knight**

*A dark herald of cinder that uses life giving flame to cremate his/her opponents while sustaining allies and closing their wounds.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Equipment**

One handed and off-hand(*note: not a weapon nor a shield*) or two handed weapons

Plate

Intellect, stamina and armor

&amp;#x200B;

**Resources**

Runes and runic power(Works as mana here, name and visuals stay for flavor)

&amp;#x200B;

**Passives**

mastery:

**Fire and blood:** Causes friendly targets covered in *cinder* to store and deal X%(mastery variable) of all your healing done as fire damage. Fire and blood is evenly distributed among targets under the effect of *cinder* but has an increased effect on your *ghoul(to make solo content like questing or WQs easier)*.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prime abilities**

*Cinder(mistweaver inspired):*

5s cooldown, X runic power, indefinite duration

Friendly target

4 charges, cover the target in strengthening cinders reducing incoming damage by X%(static amount)

Interaction: Fire and blood

&amp;#x200B;

*Engulf:* 

X Runic power/mana

Friendly target

Detonate your cinder to engulf the target in life sustaining flames causing X healing over 3s and causes your fire and blood to instantly damage nearby targets for its damage.

Interaction: Fire and blood

&amp;#x200B;

*Blood Brand(holy paladin inspired):*

1 charge, indefinite

Friendly target

Increases your healing done to the target by X% and increasing the effect of ""fire and blood"" by X%. Provides the target with X% leech

&amp;#x200B;

*Death Strike:* 

2 Runes, X runic power/mana

Focuses dark power into a strike that deals X damage and causes your cinders to heal its targets for X% of the damage done, has a chance to spread cinders.

Interaction: Fire and blood

&amp;#x200B;

Dark bargain*:*

1 Rune

Damages your ghoul for 10% of its max HP and heals your target for X HP.

Interaction: Fire and blood

&amp;#x200B;

*Death and Decay:*

1 rune, X runic power/mana

Corrupts the target ground causing X damage over 10s and reduces targets damage done by X%

&amp;#x200B;

**Cooldowns**

*Ignite*

x min CD, X runic power/mana

Causes all your cinders to detonate and instantly engulf their targets in healing flame for X HP over 5s

*Note: no interaction with fire and blood*

&amp;#x200B;

*Raise dead:*

2 runes, 30s cooldown

Raises a ghoul to fight by your side.

&amp;#x200B;

*Ashes to ashes:*

x min CD, x runic power/mana

Sacrifice your ghoul in a fiery explosion covering X nearby friendly targets in cinders

&amp;#x200B;

*Corpse explosion:*

x min CD, X runic power/mana

Causes your ghoul to explode in a shower of fire and gore dealing X damage to nearby targets

&amp;#x200B;

**Example talent row**

***Standing in fire:*** *Your cinders increases movement speed by 5%*

*Basic passive talent, extra movement speed. Low because cinders last indefinitely(until detonated).*

***Sputtering flame****: Cinder now absorbs X(+Y)% incoming damage but lasts 10s*

*A strong talents but will make your rotation more hectic, rewards skill. Can instead be very detrimental if you can't handle it. Good for single target babysitting.*

***Crimson ash:*** *Your cinders periodically increases your targets leech and haste by X%*

*For offensive play, will boost party damage and self sustain. Good for when you out-gear content or are confident you will not need the other talents.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Gameplay(fun part)**

*The ember death knight will be all about high risk high reward micromanaging but has potential to be quite polarizing, which is fine, there are three other specs. You will be dependent on your party members to shine. If a player stands around picking their nose your fire and blood will suffer(well). Actually managing your pets movement can be used to pull off cool shit. The spec is meant to ""feel"" satisfying, engulf should have the proper visuals and sound to feel satisfying for the player. It's playing on the feel of being on the offence while helping your party. A challenge would be the visuals for the receiving player, it should not feel like they are doing something wrong(being on fire.).*

If I would summarize the spec in one word it would be: Detonations

That will be the bread and butter of game-play.

And just to clarify the difference from a disc priest, you *heal* to deal *damag*e here. Not *damage* to *heal*. You are healing while feeling like you are dpsing. And another clarification from the legion disc priest about the atonement -&gt; cinder similarity. Atonement is applied so you can start healing, cinder works more like storing healing on targets for when it's needed. Only death strike has any damage to healing functionality.

**mythic+** ***example scenario:***

You enter a dungeon with your mates and pop the key. Timer goes down and you summon your **ghoul** and pop **""blood brand""** on the tank. Then start to cast **""cinder""** on your party to prep(and possibly increasing movement speed) alternatively cast **""*****ashes to ashes""*** but that will mean no ghoul for 30s. You now encounter your first pack and you immediately cast **""death and decay""** on it to cause damage and reduce incoming damage and start hammering away with **""death strike""** to trickle heal your party and deal both instant st damage and damage through **""fire and blood"".** 

Billy the hunter now fucks up and grabs a nearby mob and receives some damage but the tank quickly picks it up. You use **""engulf""** to quickly patch Billy up and then gives him a new **""cinder""** for his next fuck up. One mob now casts a big aoe attack that heavily damages the entire party so you pop your **""ignite""** CD to quickly top everyone off, to the detriment of your dps since your cinders are gone. The pack is pretty low and you feel confident so you burst your ghoul with ""**corpse explosion""** to quickly finish them off. 

Next up you encounter your first boss and now the tank will need more babysitting. So your first reaction is to **""engulf""** his **""cinder""** buff but that is not enough so you now start to spend your *third* resource, your ghoul, with **""dark bargain""**. But you cant do that forever, your ghoul has a finite health-pool and the trickle heal from **""cinder""** is not enough to sustain it forever. So in your pro gamer move you blow it up with **""corpse explosion""** as it approaches 0% to deal extra instant damage to the boss or use **""ashes to ashes""** to quickly regain your **""cinder""** on the party for more healing and damage over time. After making that tactical choice you re-summon your ghoul and keep hammering with **""death strike""** until the boss finally dies.

The rest of the run goes well and you eventually get to the end, open the chest and get something shit, cry a bit then look over at skada and notice your big juicy damage contribution from all the well timed **""cinder""** casts and **""corpse explosions""** while still keeping people alive**.**

&amp;#x200B;

Strengths: No cast times at all also a great ""over-gearing the content"" healer.

Weaknesses: Burst aoe damage and has dk movement

&amp;#x200B;

**Miscellaneous Fluff**

Imagine the visuals to be a less flashy ""fire mage"" fire and more towards ""warlock shadowy"" fire. The main spells should be possible to categorize by visuals into **""set up""** and **""detonators"".**

**Set-up** visuals applies to the abilities that sets the target up for future burst of healing like ""cinder"" and ""ashes to ashes"". They should be ashy/smoky with bright burning particles and rather subtle.

**Detonator** visuals applies to spells like ""engulf"", ""corpse explosion"" and ""ignite"" and should be more flashy but in a more controlled and living way. Not just a big boom of fire but a living fire that just burst into life around the target.

**Rest: ""**Fire and blood"" should be noticeable for affected players making them see flames periodically burst from attacked targets. Death strike and death and decay should look the same as usual. ""Drain"" is less a fire spell and more towards blood, you should see a bright red wave moving from the ghoul to the healed target.",11,1584126196,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fi4urk/discussion_imagining_a_death_knight_fire_spec/,wow,1

fi25v9,Icebane08,Ways you've bungled a vision?,"Hey guys, what mishaps have had in visions?  So far I've:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Used CD's on the last elite before the boss in the valley of spirits on my first 5 mask org run.  Realizing how dumb that was I mounted and ran back to the low sanity drain area to eat a k'bab and let my CD's come back up.  It wasn't long before I realized that the NPC pulled the boss, and I was in combat with leaden foot ultra far from the boss.  It took me like 300 sanity just to run back to him.  My cheat death saved me and I actually completed the run on that attempt but that was such a facepalm.
2. Hot foot leaped me inside a crate, I couldn't get out and just sat in my fire pool until hotfoot leaped me back out, but while I was in there a horrific figment spawned, and when I hotfooted out he evade bugged on me.  It took me like 30s to finally find a spot where I could attack him.  
3. Ran into a clone while trying to run out of the roaring blast on the first elite on the right in Shaw's area.  Cheat death procs, but the animation takes so long that she runs up on me and starts doing blade flourish, by the time I have control of my character again I'm down to like 100 sanity again and end up wiping on the run.  
4. Tried to use an invis pot to skip a pack in the totem area of org.  I'm playing destro lock, the invis pot works fine for me but for some reason my pet remains visible, gets in combat with a pack and when I get out of invisibility I have 3 packs bearing down on me with 5 masks up.

My first cosplay dedicated to coronavirus outbreak. 

In a mandatory quarantine hotel room, with only a few gears at hands: a luxury double bed made of two single beds with a small split in middle, a could-bring-light-to-the darkest-time table lamp, and two Draenei hair bands. 

Without any heads up for me to prepare something more decent to cosplay my character in one of my favourite games, World of Warcraft. These are all I have in the time of difficulties.  

I am in this super-heoric mode where only the black-background skills are clickable: limited usage of magic-mask, 1 day CD of AIDS medicines in needles from China, and the forever CD hospital and doctors that are (un)available. 

Where the bed and sleeping pills are my buffs. I am chased by the coronavirus on the map so I have to hide in this hotel room and wait for 10 days, with the hope that I will be double-experienced after I am let out.

The first week of cloak progress, those few hundred mementos are great. That could snag a much-needed point on the talent tree. After points start costing 6500, a raid trash clear is nothing.

Now that people are capping out on research and buckling down to multi-mask runs, an extra pittance of mementos isn't helping. If killing all the minibosses gave enough CVs for an extra vision run though, that would be a double benefit. For one, dropping the same quantity in all raid difficulties would be fine, players doing harder stuff would already get more power progression benefit out of the same amount.

fhu51x,-Shiroyasha-,Is 7-8 months of Alpha+Beta Enough ?,"So given that we can expect the Alpha being playable within the next two weeks, if Shadowlands plans on releasing Late Oct.-Late Nov. then we will have about 7-8 months to test content. I'm assuming content on alpha rolls out periodically so most of the content won't be playable until sometime in the summer. I haven't followed many of the alpha-beta cycles neither do I know anything about game development, so I was wondering if that sounds like enough time to properly test the systems they plan to introduce. 

&amp;#x200B;

N.B - I've heard a lot of people rumoring an August-September release. If that is truly the case, we'd be looking at 5 months of alpha-beta probably a lot less by the time most the content is actually testable.

fhtccd,angerkor,Happy for the news of sharing essences ..,"Well, i am the korean user who wrote about how hard to get ""blood of the enemy"" in korea server.

As i said in that post, korean server has few people and pvp content is a dead content.

Because of the ' blood of the enemy ' the pvp queqe was a littile a little active.
(I don't want to say like this but really a little)

Now, the essences are shared so, skilled players will not go to pvp again for essences.
Then, they will just work for sharing.

I know that patch is good and cool(actually i feel this was too late )
However this patch is kind for skilled players not new ones.
(At least for the essence "" blood of the enemy "")

I am feeling happy to hear the news.
But i can't smile when i thought about my friend who is feeling tired because of the epic bg queqe.

Using /stopwatch (standard Blizzard UI) I started with Blizzard's guide: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23320959/get-your-legendary-cloak?blzcmp=app and ran a level 120 that I hadn't logged in since before 8.3  The entire run up until I got the cloak took me 1 hour, 43 minutes, and 36 seconds.

fhqbqs,jerax42,"Why do casuals believe that if Blizzard implemented RIO (which they already did, btw), it would all be fine?","A lot of people, especially at the beginning of BfA complained that ""rio is evil and it should be something Blizzard did, if Blizzard did it, it'd be all fine!"".

What the fuck. **A number is a number, no matter who provides it.** To me, this is insanity, if someone told me these things straight to my face and I could make sure they truly believed them, I'd ask them to take their pills immediately.

How can some people say that, because Blizzard now offers that number by default, any ""issue"" is solved? Your runs are being tracked, everyone's, in fact, if you don't have the addon, it's you who doesn't see these scores and the people who declined you see them.

RIO/wlogs/wowp are literally nothing more or nothing less a nicer representation of your gameplay. That's it. They don't fake your data, they simply just represent it. Who cares who does that? RIO is objectively fair. You did the run or you didn't.

Believe me when I say, to anyone who thinks otherwise, if Blizzard didn't provide these numbers, you would not see anyone attempt to do challenging content, this world some people think exists where we're all friends and care about each other -- it doesn't exist. Nor the world where you'd have to inspect people by fyling to them and so on, these are not good things, they are wasteful and anyone who remembers them dearly is on a serious nostalgia trip that's very dangerous. It wasn't fun wasting 4-5 hours building a group, the boys in Classic now are reminded about it. RIO is an amazing tool to finding capable people and it's nearly always accurate if you know how to navigate.

This thread reminded me exactly of this, but there's endless threads with this exact argument on the forums and on reddit if you wanna search on your own:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fhox64/wow\_and\_its\_important\_info\_being\_tied\_to\_third/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fhox64/wow_and_its_important_info_being_tied_to_third/)",11,1584057417,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fhqbqs/why_do_casuals_believe_that_if_blizzard/,wow,1

Azeroth herself isn't doing so well still, she's stabilized, but not well.

She's been through multiple rounds of hell nonstop. Through the burning legion coming again, to N'zoth doing his work, and now with the shadowlands literally in front of our faces, it just seems like she's going to just end soon. AKA be corrupted. There's only so much a world soul can take, not to mention, freaking Sargeras's sword is still stuck in her, literally.

As for her children, we're simply getting tired. As well as getting depleted from resources. And a lot of Azerothians are dead from the legion, N'zoth, and the war.

Not to mention that the naaru are showing their true colors and the light will 9/10 unbalance shit out since all the old gods are dead from this realm.

It says I'll get a total of 60 days of game time. It says (currently) that the price is around $110 — after 60 days, would I have to pay $110 again for the same content?

I've also seen some posts about buying more game days. Is this just buying more time to play, and would it effect me having the epic edition at all?

fhmdgq,celestion103,My ideal factions for playable races,"If I was in charge of WoW's development and had unlimited resources, this is how I would organize the playable races and factions, according to my interpretation of the lore. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Horde: Veterans of legendary conflicts, this is a people unified by a tradition of strength and honoring their ancestors through battle. 

* Orcs: orgrimmar and mag'har
* Trolls: darkspear, zandalari
* Tauren: thunder bluff, taunka, highmountain
* Goblins
* Ogres: one-headed, two-headed

&amp;#x200B;

2. Alliance: Bound by their faith and sense of righteousness, this is a people ready to deal out justice and protect the innocent of any land.

* Humans: stormwind, kul'tiran
* Dwarves: bronzebeard, wildhammer, dark iron
* Gnomes: gnomeregan, mechagnome
* Draenei: exodar, lightforged
* High Elves: silver covenant, void

&amp;#x200B;

3. Forsaken: Outcasts who have won their own struggles against greater cosmic forces, this is a people who will use whatever power available to survive.

* Undead: human, elf, san'layn
* Blood Elves: light-eyed, fel-eyed
* Nightborne: nighthold, nightfallen\*
* Broken: ashtongue, krokul
* Naga

&amp;#x200B;

4. Sentinels: Guardians of nature and the wilds, this is a people of savage ferocity that will stop at nothing to protect their ancient homelands.

* Night Elves: darnassian, night warrior
* Worgen: night elf, human
* Vulpera
* Furbolgs
* Saplings\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

5. Neutral: free agents who may join a faction of their choosing

* Pandaren
   * Horde: huojin from the Wandering Isle
   * Alliance: tushui from the Wandering Isle
   * Forsaken: previously Sha-possessed from Pandaria
   * Sentinels: devotees of the August Celestial from Pandaria

&amp;#x200B;

I kept any existing races, added some new ones, and collapsed many allied races into customization options of the original race. While the factions are themed around similar values and origins, it was not my intention to make them perfectly homogeneous. I would have the game mechanics allow for cross-faction play and communication outside of faction-controlled cities (or pvp if you have warmode on). I also tried to leave the non-playable, immortal races out. In order for all factions to access all classes some additions like nightborne druids or sapling paladins would have to be made.

\* retcon so that  arcan'dor fruit does not always revert a nightfallen back to their nightborne state but just stops the hunger and loss of sanity

For example, there could be a Mutating Void Weed that has a 40% chance of being Zin'anthid, 40% chance of being any other normal BFA herb, 5% chance of being Anchor Weed, and a 15% chance of being multiple herb drops.  Likewise for mineral nodes could be an Unstable Geode with the same idea.

fhi7v6,AlpacaWoolHat,RP servers are superior in every way and I wish I could transfer all my characters there.,"I have always been pretty casual in WoW but I had these episodes where I would go super hardcore like for example at the start of BfA. That is untill I realized how this game is basically a hamster wheel and its not either MMO or RPG anymore.

However, my friend told me about RP servers and promised me if I return I will have a lot of fun. He was right, its amazing. I play on Argent Dawn and no matter if the actual game is bad I can always have fun with people. It motivates me to play because you feel like you can show off stuff to people or maybe get new things to help you RP in different ways and have fun with others, meet new people. Just walking around the city and seeing people interact, play games, act, is really refreshing and makes you feel like you are actually in a fantasy world. You always see the same people that you pass every day, the sense of community is really strong. People are very creative, sure some meme about it being ERP heaven but these people quickly become a distorted background to a lot of brilliant roleplayers, some of which will become you friends.

Playing on a normal server nowadays is... weird. Its like playing demo version of the game. I wish I could mass transfer my characters there without paying 200 euro or something. Im not sure if other RP servers are the same but I can imagine experience may vary. 

Idk if I should tag it with discussion or feedback.",23,1584027502,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fhi7v6/rp_servers_are_superior_in_every_way_and_i_wish_i/,wow,1
fhhzwx,whenitsready,The WoW Diary Excerpt: The Art of Herding Developers,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/icmdn3o3d9m41.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f702975745e29599c4b8f8607d56c8302031d11e

**The Art of Herding Developers** 

Mark Kern once remarked that he’d never seen a professional group as sociable as Team 2. We went to lunch together with little regard to whom we ate with, squeezing into the backseats of one another’s cars in spontaneous groups. Often our lunchtime herds were so big there was only a shortlist of restaurants that could seat us. There were remarkably few cliques or departments that kept to themselves, at least not until later in the dev cycle. As the project aged, its employees formed into more regular lunch crews, and people ate with members of their department. During our dinners, most people still circled around tables in the hallway, and everyone tried their best to converse about topics that weren’t work-related. 

We had been staying until 10:00 p.m. twice a week for a few months to polish the game for our big announcement at the ECTS, but half of the team stayed later. At 10:00, some played *Counter-Strike* for an hour or so before going home or back to work. 

Since I thought of Blizzard as a patron more than an employer, I stayed late every night and put in twelve-hour days on weekends. WoW was my first foray in the entertainment industry, and building dungeons was what I loved doing. Besides, I was a transplant from NYC and felt out of place in the sunny climes of Orange County. In the four years making Vanilla WoW, I’d never stepped into the ocean despite living so close to it. I was by no means the only person sustaining this crazy pace; many of us worked hard because we simply didn’t want features or content cut from the game. I hated the idea of reusing dungeons for different locations in the world, and I secretly wanted to build all the dungeons myself just because each one had such a cool vibe. By my thinking, each dungeon had to be great—no matter what the cost. For a few years, level design was my life, and that suited me perfectly. By having no life and spending all my time in the Team 2 area, I can say with confidence that generally, the hardest workers were the programmers. Collin Murray and Scott Hartin spent many of their weekends in the office. I was a roommate of Tim Truesdale, who often experimented with code and features (on his own time) that weren’t on his task list but nevertheless occupied his spare evenings in case he discovered something cool to put into the game. Tim and I often commuted into work together, although the late hours made it difficult for us to establish a regular rideshare rhythm. 

Some employees had spouses and children, and no one wanted kids to miss their father just because he worked on computer games. Still, for a few years of the development, the entire Vanilla WoW team worked many late nights, and I think it was remarkable that no one worked only regular hours. 

Mark and Shane, the team leads, were very conscious of not burning everyone out because of their experience on *StarCraft*. They had both been associate producers on the project and vowed to avoid pushing Team 2 as hard as the *StarCraft* devs. *StarCraft’s* dev cycle was nightmarish in that the goalposts were always moving. Whenever they crossed the finish line, Allen Adham found room for improvement, saying the game wasn’t polished enough and asked everyone if they could hunker down for a few weeks longer. Whenever we reached the next deadline, another issue would arise, and it extended again, prolonging the crunch of late hours. The light at the end of the *StarCraft* tunnel always turned out to be a mirage. Each “final” sprint collided directly into another. And then another. Fans camped out in Blizzard’s parking lot and counted the cars, reporting on websites how many people were working at night. *StarCraft’s* drop-dead due dates repeatedly missed until it was over a year later. Shane reminisced how people slept in sleeping bags on the floor. Showers and meals were skipped. To this day, few people who served on the *StarCraft* team play the game. Both Shane and Mark agreed that people weren’t as productive when exhausted, and it just wasn’t worth it. Allen Adham’s nerves had been so worn out he left the company he founded until Blizzard convinced him to help out on WoW years later. In the wake of *StarCraft’s* quality-of-life costs, Shane and Mark vowed they’d never push a team like that, and their solution was to start the late nights early.

Everything from playing the class right to add on's and what not. I want to build  up from the casual player to some one that can do everything in the game. I have fully committed my self to just playing wow for now. So if there is any one out there that would like to show me how to play the right way that would be great. I have no problem starting a new character fresh. I mainly was playing mage a warlock but I am open to learning a different class. Right now I am on the Arthas realm but will make a new toon on what ever. Thanks in advance. And if it matters I am a grown mature adult so no worries of being the kid that dosent listen and what not. I know that is a thing with people playing games now. Thanks again.

fhfvt1,Jaindreas,Could be coming back to retail.,"Hey, 

""Go back to retail""

Played WoW from BC and then long breaks on and off leveling to BFA. Like alot of people I was loving classic but recently I realised the heavy grind along side the lack of a substantial storyline was not for me so I decided to create a Dwarf Rogue on WoW Retail just to see how it felt and I ended up becoming quite attached. I've leveled him to 30 and I don't use heirlooms. I've found that the story is engaging (although outdated) the graphics and combat feel amazing, learning outlaw rogue especially as I've never played it before brought a whole new feeling to how I experienced the game.  

However, I worry that I'm maybe wasting my time on this as the leveling is quite easy, dungeons gear me out insanely, zone levels are strange, I sold 20 Silverleaf for 300g and overall it can feel abit overwhelming and very isolated. 

My question is should I just be boosting a character through BFA or is there benefit to still doing this WoW leveling experience all the way to 120.

fhf3ac,gustavperuses,"Gathering (Herbalism, Fishing, Mining) should be made worthwhile regardless of on which continent you do it.

Enemies are weaker, the landscape might have a flatter design, and so on. 

BUT. There is a way around this. If there are Trading hubs in every city where you are able to sell your fish, ore, herbs or whatever it may be and convert it into either gold or more modern materials used in current recipes, that problem would be solved. Blizzard could simply balance the rewards for such conversions based on how easy a particular legacy material is to obtain, if there are lots of it available, and so on. 

For good measure, that which has already been stockpiled when this feature launches could be worth less than new ones acquired, so there isn't a way to suddenly abuse the market and cash in billions.

The healer kept yelling at me to use my defenses, which I think I'm already doing. 

I keep my ironskin brew up constantly, no matter what and I use my Fortifying brew when things start to get a little sticky. 

I use my keg smash on cooldown followed my my flame breath when it's ready to debuff the enemies. 

He kept yelling at me to clear my stagger. I told him that I'm not gonna waste my charges to clear a 10% stagger. I mostly save my charges for the Ironskin, but I clear my stagger once it gets near the halfway point or beyond.

I'm only level 55 currently with Brewmaster, so I don't have access to every defensive ability, which I made clear to him, but he kept talking shit telling me how bad of a tank I am.

I also make sure that I'm taking all the damage. Almost 100% of the time I have threat on every single enemy in the group/boss.

&amp;#x200B;

I read on a blizzard forum about someone having similar issues, and he was told ""If the healer is having a hard time keeping you up at half stagger, it's a healer problem, not yours."" I don't know if this is a true statement or not, but my stagger was almost always well below half.

fh72zo,Rayona086,How 15+ players in LFR bonded together with sheer determination to fight N'Zoth for the first and win (after 4 hours),"
Let me tell you a story from last night where i attempted to fight N'Zoth for the first time. We downed the entry boss first try and then entered his room. No explanation, no pause, just a ready check and a pull. 60 seconds later half the raid is mind controlled (MC'ed) and we wipe, not even finishing phase one.

Right off the bat half of everyone leaves, we lose a tank, but manage to keep 4 healers. Everyone start pointing fingers, yelling, 5-6 people start trying to vaguely describe the encounter that they don't know well. So a question was finally ask, ""who has finished this fight?"". We get only 7 people to admit to even finishing this fight and only one that claims they have finished it in LFR. More people leave at this point and a few more join.

At this point we know its going to be rough, and we also know we were most likely going to be hitting max determination stacks. So after about a 10 min wait we got a new tank, we brief him and we pull. We last through first phase still losing most everyone but we make it at least to phase 2. Rinse and repeat for 2 hours.

2.5 hours in,  we have not managed to get the boss below 85%. Tanks are mad, we are losing 7-8 people per try and new people are coming in and dying making it even harder. But then a blessing. We pick up 2 VERY geared dps who know the fight, a fury warrior and a warlock. These guy end up holding the top 2 dps spots and understand the insanity mechanic. So after a brief chat with them clarifying that we had the basic idea right we made a plan.  Me (also fury warrior but un-geared and terrible dps) would make the calls. Losing my dps was nothing if i could keep people alive by directing. 2 heavy dps focused down MC'ed players due to fast burst, this drastically helped with the insanity that several members were still having problems with. With this new plan we managed to make it to phase 3 for the first time at about the 3 hour mark. 

The rest of the story goes quick. We only wiped 2-3 more times as we figured out add mechanics and each time more and more people were still alive in phase 3, letting our dps focus more on the boss amd in turn decreasing insanity issue buy killing faster.

 At about 4 hours in we did it. In a shower of notifications, more then 15 of us beat N'Zoth for the first time in a LFR group. All but one player stayed for the cinematic that played (bit weak btw) and for a few minutes after we just chilled, swapped loot and relaxed. I made a few new friends that day. And thats it, i went on my way and decided to take a few days break after that. For some this might not be an achievement, but for me amd 15 of us that fought for 4 hours on a LFR boss that we saw for the first time, it was quite the experience.",116,1583971218,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fh72zo/how_15_players_in_lfr_bonded_together_with_sheer/,wow,3

Support said nothing helpful after I put in a ticket. That for quest items they have to be looted from the boss or they’re gone and nothing can be done.

So I assume the quest takes 4 weeks to complete and you can’t re kill it for another one in the same week. Would that apply for something I missed the drop on?

fh2g3m,Leftwing_agitator,I am once again coming to ask for you to consider...,"Look at priests in pvp. Fairly strong, yes? Oh wait, those are DISC priests. Let's talk about shadow priests. 

Is shadow strong? Yes. Shadow \*CAN\* be strong sometimes. That \*can\* is really the point here. Shadow cannot disperse when kicked. Sometimes, we can't even use power word:shield when kicked.

Shadow only has one real functional magic school, and that magic school is shadow. Psychic scream, fade, silence and psychic horror are ALL shadow spells. Even fade is a shadow spell. 

But this can be somewhat worked through. Sort of. If you are fighting in 1v1. 

If you are fighting in a bg, you are going to lose. You will be focused. It does not matter what class you play, you will be focused eventually. However many other classes exhibit alot more... resilience than shadow. A monk can use their movement abilities to run away, rogues can vanish, paladins can bubble, hunters have both feign AND disengage, and shadow has... not much. In BGs, this means that shadowpriests are easy kill targets. the other team focuses them, and they die. They simply do not survive long enough for other healers to save them. 

Would you consider having a fade spell that does what it is advertised to do? Namely, short circuiting enemy player aggro? The easiest way to do this would be for the improved fade talent to give invisibility in addition to its current bonus of 4 seconds of dodge. An even less intrusive option would be for improved fade to simply drop the enemy players current target, and make the priest immune to being tab targeted for 4 seconds. 

Would that be op? I really don't think so. Even if fade were to be reset by dispersion, I don't think it would be OP. All it does is make enemies stop targeting the priest for 4 seconds. 4 seconds of extra life. Come on people. is 4 measly seconds of extra time to be alive (not even doing damage) OP? All I want is to have enough time for a healer to lifegrip me or drop a healing bubble on me without being forced to blow my major defensive (dispersion).",2,1583953670,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fh2g3m/i_am_once_again_coming_to_ask_for_you_to_consider/,wow,1

It is 2020. World of Warcraft is a hugely successful game that revitalized the MMO scene after a decade and a half of games failing to entice consumers. Blizzard Entertainment is about to release the first expansion to the game, titled “The Burning Crusade”.  
The only races/classes that exist at the beginning are those that existed during WoW 1.0.

**Welcome to Outland!**

As the Dark Portal opens, adventurers enter a 2-hour cinematic-set-piece scenario in which they defend Nethergarde Keep / Stonard from the invasion of the Fel Horde and the demons. The Dark Portal finally calms down, when Khadgar appears on the other side. One of the lost Sons of Lothar, Khadgar calls both the Alliance and the Horde to cross the Dark Portal and free Outland from the grasp of the Legion and its servants.  

**New Zones at Launch**: Hellfire Peninsula, Shadowmoon Valley, Nagrand, Terokkar Forest, Blade’s Edge Mountains, Zangarmarsh.  

**New Class Options at Launch:** The Sunwalker Tauren being the ways of the Paladin to the Horde, while the Wildhammer Shaman join the Alliance.

**Leveling Paths:** When you cross into Outland, you have two paths to choose from while leveling.  

•	**Path of the Assault**: You decide to take an active role in hunting the Burning Legion across Outland. The Horde begins their quest in Hellfire Peninsula, where the orcs of Azeroth, led by Thrall, confront their dark past and fight against their demonic-infused brethren. The Alliance begins their quest in Shadowmoon Valley, where they meet the remnants of the Sons of Lothar and push back the Legion all the way to the Black Temple. Alliance and Horde can travel to the other side’s zone for a short quest experience (similar to how BFA leveling zones work) that is focused around the faction war. Even if we have a common enemy in the Legion, distrust is still high, and neither side wants the other to gain too much knowledge of demonic secrets, legion siege weaponry, or access to Outland’s nether powers.  

•	**Path of the Protector**: You decide to preserve what is left of Outland, help its native people and build a bulwark against the Legion. The Alliance meets the enigmatic Draenei in Terokkar Forest and defeats the Arakkoa and the Shadow Council as they encroach upon Auchindoun. The Horde travels to Nagrand, under the leadership of Thrall, and meets the Mag’har, a clan of orcs who refused to drink the Demon Blood. Both Horde and Alliance travel to the other zone for a few cooperative-peacekeeping quests. The Mag’har and the Draenei eventually band together to preserve Outland.  

•	At the level cap, characters may play through a shorter version of the other “Path” to unlock all the factions and world quests. Players may still play the whole version of the other path for Loremaster, gear, and addictional Demonic Power.  

•	Also at the level cap, both sides unlock Blade’s Edge Mountains and Zangarmarsh. At Blade’s Edge, both Alliance and Horde chase down the Gronn and the remnant of the Black Dragonflight. At Zangarmarsh, the factions enter in a three-way war between themselves and the Naga for control of the diminishing waters of Outland.

---

**New Expansion Feature: Demon Hunting**  

As players level and complete endgame content, they unlock “Demonic Power” that allows them to tap into the Legion’s arsenal. Players first unlock quality of life abilities, such as spectral sight and double jump. As they collect demonic power by completing world quests, dungeons, and other tasks, they eventually unlock powerful bonuses. Some of those are rotational abilities, like Eye Beam, while others are powerful cooldowns, like Metamorphosis. All players regardless of race and class get to participate in this endgame leveling system. Demonic Power takes the place of endgame talents and tier set bonuses. While an infinite grind, there is a catch up mechanism for players that fall behind.

**New Expansion feature: Shattrath City**


Assaulted by the Legion, the Fel Horde and Kael’thas’ Blood Elves, the Naaru of Shattrath City call out to all champions of Outland to protect and rebuild the city. Collect “City Resources”, and use them to upgrade and expand the city in a server-wide war effort. Individual players may choose to contribute to different projects in the city. As the Legion assaults Shattrath in weekly events, some of the players’ progress is destroyed and the city must be rebuilt. Earn the trust of followers like Khadgar’s servant and Garona Halforcen and send them to missions across Outland. Players earn the status of “Champion of Outland” when they complete the main storyline.  

**New Dungeons**: Each leveling zone comes with one dungeon at the end of their zone questing experience:

•	Hellfire Citadel: confront the 3 bosses of the Burning Legion in the zone: Kargath Bladefist, Pathaleon the Calculator, and Magtheridon.  
•	Black Temple Grounds: free Akama from his servitude to Illidan Stormrage. Fight against Illidan, who eventually retreats into the Black Temple, mocking your group's unprearedness.  
•	Auchindoun: Stop the abuse of Draenei souls by putting an end to Fallen Exarch Maladaar and delve deeper to stop the summoning of Murmur.  
•	Oshugun Grounds: Curb the ethereal invasion of Nagrand and reconnect Mag’har and Draenei alike to the monument of Oshu’gun. Cleanse the fallen Naaru back to its original, radiant state.  
•	Gruul's Lair: Chase down the leadership of the Ogres and Gronn of Outland and free Blade's Edge.  

**Raid Dungeon at Launch: Serpentshrine Cavern.**

Stop the Naga from taking over Zangarmarsh for the Legion. The dungeon culminates in an epic battle against not only Lady Vashj but also NPCs from the other faction who are not about to let you control Zangarmarsh. Ally with the NPCs for an easy progression kill or turn against them for a Feat of Strength.


**Mythic Plus Seasonal Affix:** ""Enemies of Outland"". Dungeons are brimming with additional creatures (gronn, arakkoa, ethereals, fel orcs) that try to stop the Alliance and the Horde from controlling Outland. Some dungeon bosses are replaced by one of the enemy creature bosses (alternates each week). 

---

**Patch 2.1: The Skies of Outland**


Two legion commanders still remain: Illidan Stormrage is locked up in the Black Temple, while Kael’thas Sunstrider is flying around the enigmatic Tempest Keep that appears over the city of Shattrath. The Shat’ari Skyguard faction allows players to learn how to fly, assuming that they have first completed all 2.0 quest, exploration, and reputation content first. With their newfound flying abilities, the Champions of Outland assault the Black Temple from above, and fight off the Legion-aligned Blood Elves that pour from Tempest Keep.  

**New Factions:** The Aldor and the Scryers. A group of zealous Draenei and a group of Blood Elf deserters join A’dal in Shattrath City, unlocking more quests centered around the rebuilding of Shattrath.


**New Mythic Dungeon:** Karazhan. Delve into the tower of Medivh and unlock secrets of the Burning Legion.


**New Raid Dungeon: The Black Temple**
Weakened by the Skyguard’s assault, Illidan’s stronghold is under siege. Assist Akama as he challenges Illidan for his people’s freedom and the liberation of Outland.


**Mythic Plus Seasonal Affix:** “Demonic”. New demon servants appear in trash packs around the dungeons. Bosses copy the “Demon hunting” abilities that the dungeon delving players have equipped.

---

**Patch 2.2: Fury of the Sunwell**

New Endgame Zone: Netherstorm. Explore the small and disconnected arcane-tainted islands of Netherstorm, and slowly drain Tempest Keep of its powers.


**New Raid Dungeon: Tempest Keep**

Board the Tempest Keep and chase Kael’thas Sunstrider. After a successfully defeating Kael’thas inside TK, he declares his defeat as merely a setback, and teleports the Keep above the Sunwell. The Champions of Outland unload from Tempest Keep and progress through the second part of the raid, where they clear the demonic infestation of the Sunwell and face Kil’jaeden.


**Mythic Plus Seasonal Affix:** “Technomagic”. Bits and pieces of Tempest Keep have scattered around the dungeons of Outland. Those powerful technoarcanic artifacts complicate dungeon fights by adding effects such as gravity lapses, twisting time, and summoning ethereal weapons.

---

**Patch 2.3: Ebon’s Might.**

In a seeming deviation form the original theme of the Expansion (Which was the attack on Outland and the war against the Legion), this patch returns the heroes to Azeroth.

**New Endgame Zones:**

•	**Azuremist Isle**: Follow the Alliance as they discover a branch of Draenei that evacuated from Tempest Keep and landed into Azeroth. Free the islands from the runaway arcane energies. While both factions assist in this effort, the valiant Draenei choose to ally themselves with the Alliance that upholds the same values and belief in the Light as they do.

•	**Quel’thalas**: As Kael’thas finally lies dead and the Sunwell is purified, the Blood Elves of Quel’thalas regroup and start healinging their land. While both factions assist in this rebuilding effort, the Blood Elves choose to align themselves with the Horde, as they can now understand the Orcs better. Both races have been corrupted by the Legion and fell to its fel promises, but now that they are free, they choose to walk together.

**New Raid Dungeon: Acherus, the Ebon Hold**

While the Horde and Alliance were focused on the liberation of Outland, the Lich King sends a second necropolis to assault Azeroth. Acherus moves between Quel’thalas and Azuremist every week. When Darion Mograine is defeated, thefactions resolve to chase the Lich King in Northrend, which leads to the next expansion pack.

**Mythic Plus Seasonal Affix**: ""Necromantic"". A squad of Acherus death knights bolsters the forces inside dungeons.

**New Endgame player power feature: Reforged Atiesh.**

Khadgar has returned from Outland and claims Atiesh. Players assist him in building up its power, and gain a “Shade of Khadgar” as a permanent companion in their adventure. The shade can cast different spells as players equip it with different powers. Players that held the Naxxramas version of Atiesh learn that they had a fake all along. Players may also customize their ""shade"" with varying forms and outfits, as well as unlock Khadgar's best puns through rare drops.

---

**Patch 3.0: Wrath of the Lich King**

Once the pre-expansion patch hits, Khadgar will recall all of his Shades back into himself, as well as finally cleansing players of their Demon Hunting powers. The Lich King launches a full-out assault on Azeroth, and the players prepare to storm Northrend in the pre-expansion event.

---

**Player Versus Player in Outland**

**War Mode and World PvP**: Players may complete War Mode objectives in the other faction’s main zones. Fight for control of the towers of Hellfire and Terokkar.

**New Battlegrounds:**

**Coilfang Pumps:** The Alliance and the Horde battle in this intense resource-collection battleground to control the access of clean water.

**Eye of The Storm:** Added with the Sunwell Patch: Control the barren islands of Netherstorm and capture the flag.

**New Arenas:**

**Lower City Slums:** Despite the Naaru's lofty goals for the city, mercenary gladiators fight without faction allegiance in the slums of the Lower City. Kill your opponents while avoiding interference from the onlooking crowds.

**Circle of Blood, Ring of Trials:** They play out as in ""Real"" BC. 


---

**Original BC content that does not make the cut:** Caverns of Time (will be added in Wrath as an endgame power progression system similar to Horrific Visions), Zul’aman (will be a launch dungeon during Cataclysm), Ogrila (in this version of BC the only ogres are the savage ones, we’ll revisit Ogrila in WoD). Most of the dungeons have been combined in one dungeon per zone. The Shattered Sun Offensive becomes part of the Quel’thalas restoration questline. Netherwing drakes are store mounts. The Ruins of Lordaeron arena will be added in WotLK after the Wrathgate patch.",87,1583947152,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fh0pc0/what_if_burning_crusade_was_a_modern_expansion/,wow,1

fgzk58,Leftwing_agitator,Make everyone overpowered!,"What do you think of the idea of giving nice stuff to everyone? I am not talking about dps, we have enough of that. I am talking about movement, stealth, invisibility, social tricks, and dimensional games... 

1. Dimensional games. Right now, we have the gladiators portal trinket. This allows you to target another player with corruption, and open a portal into the void. If you click on the portal, you can stay in the void for 6 seconds. This is a really really cool mechanic, and it is a shame that it is on a 2 minute cooldown. It is a shame that no class can perform this mechanic as part of their toolkit. I think that it should be either a shadow priest, mage, or warlock spell, I favor shadow priests, because void portals are associated with the void. I would even love to see it on a void elf. THAT would be a cool racial. Especially if you could lurk in the void. 

2. Stealth. Why do rogues have to walk while stealthed? Why can't they be mounted? People say, but Hurr Durr, that's OP! Op in what way? All that being mounted does is allow you to get from point A to point B faster. Its not going to affect the performance of rogues in raid or dungeon environments. It would allow rogues to cap flags in bgs just as fast as other classes. Not exactly gamebreaking. The real change is convenience in open world. That's it. 

3. Mind games. Right now, priests have this spell called fade. Let me read you the description:  Fade out, discouraging enemies from attacking you for 10 sec. Priests have had this ability since classic. Why doesn't fade effect players? Well, that is simple. Players don't have aggro tables. They have eyeballs, and when they see red... it's dead. So, WHY DOESN'T FADE SHORT CIRCUIT ENEMY PLAYER'S EYEBALLS? Hunters short circuit player aggro with feign death all the time. Here is what fade could do: It turns the priest's healthbar to look like a friendly unit. It forces all players that have the priest selected as a target to deselect, and it makes the priest immune to tab targeting for 10 seconds. Done! Poof! You could still manually select the priest, and keep hitting them, but this actually dissuades players from attacking them!

4. Movement. Can we get some more movement abilities pretty please? It is a godamn shame that so many glyphs and movement abilities were rolled into talents. Blizzard has demonstrated it is downright unimaginative when it comes to movement. Do you remember the glyph of levitate that increased move speed by 15% while levitating? How about when disengage's speed bonus after disengaging was a passive baked into the ability? How about when waterwalking during sprint was baseline for all rogues? Remember when warlocks had demonic circle baseline? Yeah! Those types of things! Why can't we have some unity and unite about getting our nice things back? We can disagree on who should have the most dps as a class, but pruning has made the game unfun for all of us! And the cynical ones will say hurr durr, don't fight for what got taken away from you, if you don't like having all your nice stuff taken, go play another game. Those people in particular are peasants. Absolute peasants that deserve to be taken advantage of by the devs while they are locked up in stockades. &gt;:(

5. Social tricks. The basis for pvp is annoying other people. If everyone is going to get along fine, then nobody will pvp, everyone will just focus on grinding and farming. And that is a damn shame. At least, there are rare mobs that people have to farm, and fight over. However right now, professions and coalescing visions are focused on content that does not pit people into direct competition. There is the sliver of Nzoth, and that is a freaking EXCELLENT start. But it is not enough. We also need tools to discourage concentrations of players of one faction. We need novel asymmetrical weapons. Here are some examples- if you force a player to speak in shath'yar... they cannot call for help. As a result, you can gank them, and a task force to hunt you down would never form. If you have a debuff that deals aoe damage to all friendly players in 30 yards, large groups of players would end up badly harming each other. If you had a debuff that forces you to /say everything, you could be spied on by the enemy. There are numerous social tricks that wow has not even scratched the surface of. Are they annoying? Yes, but so is having a rogue gank you.",3,1583942992,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fgzk58/make_everyone_overpowered/,wow,1

fgvwb7,Lawnieboi,8.3 Woes,"Let me tell you a little bit about myself, I started playing this game around the last patch of Legion, I found it great and it got me hooked, the class design was impeccable, mythic+ and the raids were fun.

A little thing about me, I'm a very competitive guy, so once I found something I enjoy, I sunk hours upon hours trying to get better, and throughout BfA I got better and better at the game. starting at a 1k WR guild in Uldir and ending up at top 40 in the hall of fame in Nyalotha, same goes for mythic+. I ended the first season at a measly 1.4k rio and ended season 3 with 3.6k.

Along the way I always found things that I enjoyed about the game (most of them are of competitive nature), pushing m+, progressing mythic and going for logs when progress is done and a little bit of pvp here and there.

With the introduction of patch 8.3 however every single facet of the game got turned upside down for the worse. I honestly think that the replacement of the titanforging system with corruption was probably the worst mistake that the devs have ever made. It made many of the gamemodes simply unfun.

Want to push m+? You need to fullfil a checklist of gear you need to meet dps checks.

Want to progress fast and efficiently? Do whatever the top guilds did and just buy corruption and trivilize every single dps check there is in the raid.

Want to pvp? Well everyone knows about the clown show that is pvp at the moment.

Or do you want to go for logs maybe? Well, I hope your infinite agrees with you because the dps variance on some corruption is like the difference between an outlaw rogue with five buffs and with no buffs.

All of this would be more or less acceptable if the system wasn't so rng, it has so many layers of it that it might as well become an onion.

I don't know if Blizzard realizes this, but a system like this doesn't work in a game like WoW, you can't have both ridiculous rng AND low drop chances. we're at a crossroad, either go the MMO way and make gear more deterministic or go the ARPG way and just shower everyone with loot with only a handful of pieces actually worth a damn. I know any sane person would take the more deterministic approach.

This system that Blizzard adopted isn't doing them any favors, it's turning people away more than anything, you can dangle a carrot in front of a donkey and it will follow, but it's only a matter of time before it throws you off its back and kicks you in the groin.

The only thing that I hope for is that this doesn't carry over to Shadowlands, because if it does, then the expansion is essentially DoA for me, as is patch 8.3. For the first time since I started playing this game, I can without a shadow of a doubt say: This game isn't worth my time nor it is worth my money anymore.

And this post was my two cent about the state of the game before I finally take my leave.",1,1583927491,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fgvwb7/83_woes/,wow,1
fgvjyg,Actually_Rich,Shaman Tank - Earth Warden,"

*sweet wow intro narrator voice* Charged by the Titans to protect the earth, the last of the strong Black Dragonflight has fallen. Wrathion, like his father before him, has been turned by the Old Gods and fallen to the hands of Azeroth’s Champions.
Ebonhorn, Ebyssian, is the last uncorrupted black dragon. Fearing further corruption from outside sources Ebonhorn has decided to call for your aid, Shaman. He will teach you to speak to the earth as the Black Dragonflight does. You will become the new Earth Wardens with him at your helm. 



#New Shaman Spec - Earth Warden

**Weapons:** 1h mace, 1h axe, fist weapons

**Armor:** Shields, Mail

**Role:** Tank

#Hallmark Abilities

**Boulder Fist** *(Single target resource generator/No Cooldown)* - Strike your target with a fist shaped stone. Generates Maelstrom.

**Earth Shock** *(Offensive Resource Spender-Short Cooldown)* - Blast your target with concussive force. If Epicenter is active Earth Shock’s cooldown is reduced. 

**Seismic Strike** *(AOE resource generator/Medium Cooldown)* - Strike the earth releasing a shock wave in an arc in front of you. Generates Maelstrom per enemy hit. Cooldown reduced by Boulder Fist. 

**Epicenter** *(AOE Damage/Short Cooldown)* - Channel your fury into the earth around you causing an Earthquake that stays centered on you. Enemies within the quake will take damage and be slowed. Damage taken while the Shaman is affected by Epicenter will be reduced and grant Maelstrom. Larger hits grant more Maelstrom. Minimum amount of Maelstrom per hit is determined by mastery.

**Stoneshield** *(Small Mitigation/Short Cooldown)* - Infuse your shield with the power of the earth granting you an absorption shield and slightly increasing your chance to block. You can spend Maelstrom to bypass Stoneshield’s cooldown. 

**Impact** *(Mobility/Medium Cooldown)* - Designate an area within 30y. After 1s a stone pillar will erupt under you launching you and all nearby enemies to that location. Enemies that are launched by Impact will be damaged and stunned upon landing.(60sec cooldown)

**Earth Warden’s Resolve** *(Medium Mitigation/Medium Cooldown)* - Call on the power of the Earth, causing your next Stoneshield to grant triple the amount of absorption and cost no Maelstrom. (If there’s a big hit coming and you don’t have time to build a SoA shield you’ll use this. Also good 

**Strength of the Earth** *(Big Mitigation Cooldown)* - Over the next 12sec the Shaman gains 1000%(or some balanced number) Leech. All healing from Leech during this time is duplicated as a shield on the Shaman. Epicenter will not end during Strength of the Earth. The SotE shield is permanent until expended and allows Bulwark Totem shields to surpass their cap.

**Aftershocks** *(Passive Light AOE)* - After casting Epicenter or Impact your next 3 attacks will also cause light damage around the target.

**Bulwark Totem** *(Passive totem summon)* - A small percentage of damage done by the Shaman is turned into a shield for all party members within 40y, capping at a balanced amount. Bulwark Totem lasts until killed or summoned again. *The shield cap is reduced in raids.*

**Legacy of the Black Dragonflight** *(generic Tanking passive)* - The shaman takes less magic damage, gains more armor and stamina. 


###Shared Class Abilities:

Hex, Earthbind, Tremor, Capacitor, Revive, Bloodlust, Ghost Wolf, Far Sight, Ankh(Possibly not ankh?)



#Talent Examples:

**Blast Shield**: Taking damage from an enemy within 20y  of the Shaman while Stoneshield is active will blast the enemy with a cone of stone shards. Will not trigger if hit from behind. 

**Sudden Impact** - Impact has a reduced cooldown, activation time, and range but will no longer launch enemies. 

**Deafening Resonance** - Enemies struck by Aftershocks have increased casting time. 

**Hurricane** *(Replaces Epicenter)* - The Shaman summons a raging storm causing Healing Rain and Chain Lightning strikes. Damaging enemies and healing allies with Hurricane will generate Maelstrom. *(No longer reduces enemy movement speed or damage taken while Epicenter is active.)*

**Seismic Launch** - Casting Impact will leave an Epicenter at the launch point and landing point for a reduced duration. 

**Shifting Plates** - Epicenter can now be cast at a target area. It can be cast again to move it to a new area. Does not increase/decrease duration. 

**Black Dragon Breath:** (Replaces Seismic Strike) - The Shaman releases magma fury in a large cone over a couple seconds. *(No longer generates Maelstrom but does much more damage)*

**Stone Stream***(replaces Boulder Fist)*: Channel a stream of stones at a target. Generates Maelstrom. *(Gives a bit extra range and allows relief for those who don't want to break their fingers constantly hitting Boulder Fist)*

**Thrumming Bulwark**: Your Bulwark totem shields for 5% of it's capacity every 3 seconds.

#Pros&amp;Cons:

**Pros**

* Strong AoE
* Can tank large hits by pooling resources for Stormshield
* Adds minor healing/mitigation to the entire party/raid
* Can forgo defensive resource spending to make the raid sturdier with Bulwark Totem if needed
* Big defensive cooldown gets stronger with more party members

**Cons**

* Sustain/mitigation must be activated before damage is taken. No reactive sustain.
* Big consistent damage can out pace Maelstrom generation
* Only mobility is tied to a large cooldown and Ghost Wolf
* The big defensive cooldown requires substantial preparation and something to deal damage to
* No large flat damage reduction cooldowns


#Stats:

**Mastery: Hypocenter** - Increases the max capacity of your Bulwark Totem, the strength of your Stoneshield, and the minimum Maelstrom gain from Epicenter. 
 



#Playstyle: 

In dungeons you’ll initiate a fight by casting your free Stormshield and either walking into the mobs or using Impact. From there you spam Boulder Fist to reduce the CD on Seismic Strike and generate more Maelstrom while always keeping Epicenter up. Maelstrom is generally to be spent on Stormshield and not Seismic Shock unless the healer is comfortable with you having less mitigation. Think about saving Impact for moving from one trash group to the next. 

While in raids if you’re not currently tanking the boss you’ll either want to spend more Maelstrom on Earth Shock to get more absorbs out of the Bulwark totem for your raid or pool Maelstrom if a tank swap or a big mechanic is coming soon. 

The major downside to Earth Warden is that even the “quick” defensive cooldown will still take two casts. Preparing for a potential one shot mechanic can take the Earth Warden several seconds as they need to pop Strength of the Earth and dump as much dps possible to gain as much Leech healing as possible from the Bulwark Totem absorbs. You also have to make the decision between using it as a personal cooldown or using it as a raid cooldown. Which will benefit you more? The giant personal shield for a mechanic or the uncapped Bulwark Totem for a raid mechanic?

fgv1ph,Galadrina,After 8(?) weeks of getting corrupted gear I really miss Legion legendary drops.,"I love the idea of corruption - risk/reward gameplay where you may go deep into corruption and suffer negative consequences while reaping rewards like high DPS. 

Yes, balance is way off on those, we all know it, but still, the idea is pretty cool. 

But it's super frustrating getting duds from your weekly chests. With Legion artifacts you at least could farm all of the legendaries and each new one brought you closer to getting the one that you want. While corruption offers no such comfort. 

&amp;#x200B;

Blizz, we almost have 100 guilds killing Nzoth, maybe it's time to tune up gear corrupt chance? 

It's fairly frustrating being behind by 5-10k DPS to a same class and similar gear but different corruptions. Even with higher active time %. (Hello Ra-den and Stars procs).

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of ways that corruption system can be saved, but all of them require development time, which is clearly going into Shadowlands now. So just let us get showered in corrupted gear and play around with different combinations, like you intended to.

fgt18k,Smallest_Bean,I went into LFR with 410 corruption,"""Why would you do that?"", you may ask. Well my buddy friend pal it's incredibly simple.
Boredom, sheer and complete boredom.

It all started with the release of corruption, I never cleansed any of my gear, no I did not. Save for a few rank 1 pieces here and there, utterly useless to my noble cause in the long run. 
Because of this my collection of N'zoth Molested items grew larger, taking up a large portion of my bag space. Would I ever bank it? Oh of course not, it might come in handy.

Occasionally I would take off my cloak and throw as many corrupted pieces on as I could, just to see how fast I could die. Yet with 234 corruption I still wasn't satisfied, I *needed* more. My hunt for corrupted gear grew ever the more furious, every emissary, and quest that rewarded gear would be completed, nothing could stop me.
Duplicate items, worse corruptions, lower numbers; All things I despise with a burning passion, and all things that kept falling into my poor corrupted hands.
Until it happened, I full cleared a horrific vision and got rank 3 Twilight Devastation, my *2nd* rank 3 Twilight Devastation. I already had 2 rank 3 Infinite Stars at this point, so I was absolutely loaded.
My smart brain took it upon itself to equip EVERYTHING that was corrupted. 

410 corruption, yes, finally, I can die at the speed of light.

""But oh how would I show off my achievements to the world?"", I wondered. Then my wonderful guildies bestowed upon me an idea, go into LFR with all the corruption on.

*Perfect*

I switched to Guardian and qued up as a tank, my corrupted gear set at the ready. Now the que was fast and by then they had already killed Wrathion, so I was there for trash and Maut.
Of course I streamed the whole thing to my guildies, a few of them scattered about in the late night watching my dumbass do dumbass things.
We pull trash as normal, yada yada, but now the time is finally here. 
Maut.
The other tank asks me if I would like to take the add first, ""I'll take boss first"", I replied all sneaky like. Now the healers will truly see my full potential.

I switch over to my corrupted set and pull the boss, 321% damage taken increase, and healing taken reduce; As god intended.

Every melee attack by the boss nearly wipes me and the healers struggle to keep me alive, with my inevitably early death I go to the chat to trick the fools once again, ""Lmao"" ""Trash healers"".
They are all in the palm of my hand, could they even understand my true goal? To tank N'zoth with max corruption?

They brez me, oh the plebs.
I immediately grab aggro back and die once again, no healer shall keep me from the grave.
""Everyone else is alive"", one said. ""Are you even a tank?"", asked another.
By now both me and my guildies are laughing our asses off, oh the restraint it takes me not to tell them of my plan.

For some reason they brez me once again, only for me to die faster than I lay your mother. ""Why would you brez me again?"", I ask, ""Because you're the tank."" Some random ignoramus says.

I had hoped for a wipe, but no the other tank has to go and solo the bastard. I guess it was LFR after all.

""Why don't you try TO MITIGATE DAMAGE."", said one of the healers, ""How tf am I supposed to mitigate damage with with 410 corruption?"". 
And there it was, the fruit of my labor. Now they shall see why I even bothered coming to LFR with my heroic level gear. *To cuck them.*
""What did you say?"", ""I have 410 corruption :]"". I was promptly kicked, from LFR of all things.

Better in person of course, yet still one of the best things I've done in this tentacle-infested game. 
Will I do it again when I get more gear? Likely. Will I tank again? Probably not.

fgrhw9,BanquetTVDinners,Late to BFA - Concerned about AoTC requirements.,"I played Legion quite a bit and got AoTC from 2 of the 4 raids in that expansion. This was mostly thanks to being involved in a really tight guild where they would essentially take specific nights to train or carry new players. It was a great atmosphere, but unfortunately I moved to Asia and due to the extreme time difference, raiding with them became impossible.

I just resubbed two weeks ago and it feels great to level again -- just taking my time, soaking in the zones, and enjoying the lore.

I know eventually I'll hit 120 and the craving for power-progression will dominate my playtime.

In Legion, when it was ""late"" into a particular patch, it was almost impossible to find a group willing to take a pug without AoTC. Not only was getting invited to N/H Pugs difficult, even guilds were not willing to take a non-AoTC player as a new raider, even if they were high item level.

What's the deal in 8.3? Am I hopelessly too late? Should I prepare myself for the possibility of just having to make our own PUGs and through attrition, try to bang out AoTC? Joining a guild would be difficult due to my work schedule and time zone -- I'm afraid I won't even get the chance to enter heroic raiding due to my tardiness.

fgqmzq,Tuxedo717,Switching back and forth between consoleport (controller) and KB/mouse,"hey guys, i'm looking for some help.

I've tried to use the consoleport addon in the past, and while it seems cool, it's a real pain in the ass to get the keybinds right, and when I finally do, sometimes I wanna switch back to KB mouse the next day. But when i set up my spells for consoleport it moves all of my spells to different actionbar slots. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it was just keybinds, i could have 1 set for each control method, but if my fireball was on actionbar2slot4 and now it's on actionbar4slot1...totally screws me up. Is there any addon that has spell placement presets? is that even possible? or is it possible to have consoleport work as normal but without using it's action bars? i could just make the action bars myself with bartender or something.

&amp;#x200B;

fgpz2o,NeverDire,The end of my World of warcraft “journey”(The last Achievement I need to complete my mission in the game and quit),"Hi! I was playing world of warcraft since I was 6. I started my “journey” in lich king with my friend and as I started my friend told me: “-The best rewards are from pvp”.
So I started leveling up doing all pvp events I could. I was having so much fun in Wow pvp in the begining and I saw A player in top pvp armor and a gladiator mount. And I thought for myself: “-Someday, ill get the unobtainable armor, unobtainable sword and unobtainable dragon mount. And all of this will be pretty rare and not all people could get it.” 
I was playing till pandaria just bgs arenas and pvp only events,and then i lost my account due to bug abusing in pvp I did not know about. I bought a new account and were ready to get to high rated pvp as soon as realized I could be banned again for some reason(I was pretty noob back In a day). So I skipped almost whole draenor and Im regretting till today, because EXACTLY IN DRAENOR season 1 pvp elite set was THE ONE THAT I REALLY LIKED(All the previous elite sets were not that cool for me so I was just waiting gaining my skill in pvp) 
So In legion I started looking up elite sets and I did not like any of them, except the season 5. Season 5 was the one I want and I need, the best one I saw after draenor ssn 1. 
I have to mention that throughout my whole journey I was and I am playing as Unholy death knight, always. So in legion in season 5 as soon as I saw this set I started playing high rating arena. I got 2k when frost dk was OP, and I played as an Unholy. Then I got 2k in season 6 and 7 ans I realized that I have to aim for weapon. I searched unique weapons in legion and I saw artifact challenge appearance of Unholy dk! I was so happy and I got it as soon as possible. In Bfa I hoped there will be even a better elite set for death knight. In first month or two of season 1 pvp of bfa I got 2k and a bad suprise for me was that there is NO ELITE SETS ANYMORE! Ok actually there are elite sets but they are not class specific and there is no point you will not be uniq at all. I was trying my best to get to gladiator but gladiator mounts were also bad looking! They were terrible, Brown, light blue, blue - were not the colors I wanted! They looked bad for me. And season 4 comes, Me - having no hope because Life starts going into adult life with responsibilities and not much time left, starts looking up “season 4 gladiator mount”, and what I see.... I see a cool badass protodrake with amazing tabard and both of them perfectly fit to complete my mission in a game! I started thinking because I ended up in a situation where Im not much time left - next year I have to spend more time working and studying - There will be no place for playing 6 hours a day! 
So I got a plan of gathering team of eu players with exp 2k+ in 3s and the same motivation as I have to get gladiator - to start playing arena with to get gladiator rank! Right now forums and LFG people do bot help at all, so I wanna search for help here on reddit! My battle tag is DireRaven#22740 and If you wanna join me in my last battle I would be happy to invite you! It is my last chance to end my journey in world of warcraft, to get my rank, to finish it as I promised myself over 10 years ago! If you read till this moments - thanks for reading maybe my story will inspire someone!",7,1583893817,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fgpz2o/the_end_of_my_world_of_warcraft_journeythe_last/,wow,1

fgpj62,tomytronics,Something happened with LFR Wing 4 that hasn't happened to me since old AV,"I left a few hours ago after 19 wipes, spent couple hours watching video, cooked dinner, came back. Queued for the new LFR wing and when I got in, I recognized a few players that I had left a few hours before.  I asked, they had been in the same LFR group all those time!

So I left and then came back to the same LFR party a few hours later. They lost track of wipes but it had to be in the 50's by the time N'Zoth the Corruptor died.

So far common problems were:

* no cloak (instant MC and quick death)

* Forgetting to click neck item (sanity goes to zero, become MC and quick death)

* 2 tanks jumping down or too many dps jumping down

* Not enough dps down on synapses

* keyboard dying from too many key pounding over the course of 6 hours, 50 wipes, and over 25,000g in repair",137,1583891928,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fgpj62/something_happened_with_lfr_wing_4_that_hasnt/,wow,1

I recently found out that you can't simply 'go back' to classic to continue leveling it...so I wasted a huge amount of gold (and as a returning player on a new server with a fresh character, that was a tough blow to take) returning to it to max it out. I had used mostly materials from disenchanting my own drops to get to around 245...but lost it all upon 'trying' northrend enchanting. Ugh.

Should I wear that combination of gear or should I change it out to infinite stars? I think it's rank 3 because it does like 31k damage or so. But the corruption level on that is 75. So I'd have to replace everything. 

My base corruption resistance is 45 and total corruption is currently at 5. Is infinite stars worth it for PvP? My logic is the other person/team/healer I'm fighting has to waste a global cooldown on cleansing it..

Of course i was excited of BoA, and i couldn't wait to grind. Then things changed, i got to 117 before heading of to this horrible boarding scool, finally now that i am free i can play again. It took me maybe 2 hours to get 120 because of the rested XP, but now again, i was pleb with a 300 ilvl ca. I was drowned in weird quests where i have to listen to Jaina speak about some big sword who was accidentally dropped by a titan. 

Now here i am with 1 corrupted item, HoA and some 7th Legion gear and a ilvl that is 337. 

Im getting quite into it again, but so many new things happened, suddenly theres this thing called warfronts that i dont even know what is (some warcraft III inspired pve game mode apperantly) how do i play that, how do i contribute to the ""war?""

Also Island Expiditions, just collecting azerite right? 

Then there's the PVP brawl which i quite down understand how to participate in.

Also i am in need for some tips, on how to improve/farm/grind to get a better ilvl.

I hope there is someone out there willing to help me!

fghx7n,Notavailible,Blizzard should make it so that getting rank 1 of an essence unlocks rank 3 instead,"Since blizzard are so against account wide essences and want us to ""work"" for our power progression, why not make it so that meeting the requirements to unlock rank 1 of x essence grants us access to rank 3 of said essence.

fggj93,Leftwing_agitator,WTB functional mind control,"On the topic of mind control, if blizzard could give us a talent that empowers mind control, that would be great. Here is what I mean by functional. 

1. Mind control has a 60 second cooldown now, so it CAN'T BE SPAMMED. This is important, because this new mind control is really strong, and is used to actually control a target for 10 seconds. It is freakishly strong CC, as strong as blind and sap games that rogues play. 

2. Mind Control is in a different school than shadow, so it can be used when shadow is kicked. This is important, because now shadow has a spell to use against melee casters other than just spamming power word shield and dispel magic. 

3. Mind Control no longer shares diminishing returns with any other spell. This is important. Many times by the time a priest locks a target down enough to use mind control, the target already has been hit by multiple cc effects and their natural resistance to CC has increased to the point that the 10 second mind control has become a 3 second mind control. 

4. Mind control purges all slows and snares from the target. This is important. Many times a mind controlled target has been rooted, snared, and slowed. As a result, they cannot be run off a cliff.  

5. Mind Control increases all shadow damage a target takes by a substantial amount. This allows spirests to use mind control, and not lose dps. 

6. Mind Control now inflicts a 3 second debuff that slows movement speed by 50% when mind control ends. This is important for defensive use of mind control. When you mind control an enemy away, that is a gap opener. You have to have 3.5 seconds to apply your dots, 2 seconds with the misery talent. That 3 seconds is enough time for a rogue to pop sprint and be back in your face. With this change, the gap opener is actually a gap opener. 

7. Mind Control leaves a debuff on the target for 1 minute. If the target dies, the cooldown on Mind Control is reset. This is important for BG play and for wpve and dungeons. 

8. Mind control lasts for 1 minute on NPC's and 10 seconds on player characters. The ONLY thing that can break a mind control is a pvp trinket. Your not allowed to use divine shield or iceblock to break it. This is important. If you can trinket mind control, you should be allowed out for free. 

9. When mind control is kicked, the priest suffers a debuff that prevents them from casting mind control again for 60 seconds. This is important. If you can kick the priests mind control, you deserve to not be mind controlled. If you decide to waste your kick on the shadowpriests shadow school, then you deserve to be mind controlled.",10,1583857818,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fggj93/wtb_functional_mind_control/,wow,1

fgg74c,Leftwing_agitator,Momentum nerfs,"So, there were two nerfs to priests recently that completely flew under most peoples radar. They both had to deal with how the game handles momentum. 

Nerf 1. Momentum upon resurrection. This nerf occurred on the server restarts 3/3/2020. Basically, when you were dead, you used to conserve the momentum you had while you were flying on the ghost gryphon. This meant that if you were moving, and hit the rez button... you would end up falling in the direction that you were going at the speed of a ghost gryphon. Pop levitate, and that fall suddenly became a rather rapid glide that could be used to escape people that were camping you. Now, when you res, your momentum is set to 0. This allows you to be easily camped by the people who killed you before. Is this toxic dev behavior? Yes. Does it enable griefing? Yes. Does it kill fun? Absolutely. 

Nerf 2. Not exactly sure when this nerf went to effect, because I don't often have the pleasure of mind controlling people off cliffs that don't have an infinite fall (looking at you eye of the storm bg) Anyways, I distinctly remember fall damage to be a thing for mind controlled characters. Now, not so much. As long as your mind control lasts on the target, the target takes no fall damage. When the target regains control of their character, their momentum is also set to 0. So, in order to actually take fall damage, your mind controlled target needs to fall \~35 yards to break the mind control distance, and then fall an additional 20 yards AND THEY STILL ONLY TAKE MINOR FALL DAMAGE. A 50 yard fall is almost always lethal for any class if they don't have 100% health. At 66 yards, fall damage is lethal, even with 100% health. When a shaman uses thunderstorm to knock someone off a cliff, those players don't take reduced fall damage. But if you are mind controlled hoo-boy. You get a free pass. 

Both of these nerfs may seem minor, but let's compare to a rogue. If a rogue's stealth ability was disabled for 30 seconds after resurrecting, rogues would lose their shit. If thunderstorm and typhoon were removed from the game, shamans and druids would lose their shit. But nobody is talking about these changes because they were not announced in patch notes, and these nerfs are freaking subtle. &gt;:(",8,1583856580,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fgg74c/momentum_nerfs/,wow,1
fgfyea,TheBobzitto,[Suggestion] Bringing back player joy from acquiring loot while maintaining a degree of RNG,"One of the more common complaints we see about the game is how systems like titanforging/corruption have vastly reduced the joy we feel from obtaining items. Our reactions have gone from ""Oh, cool! I got a new weapon!"" to ""Whelp, got a new weapon but it didnt titanforge/roll a good corruption"".

Now, I am not against some RNG in our gear, but Blizzard is trying to implement elements of ARPGs into a game where loot is acquired at a much slower pace.

So how can we bring back the joy of dropping stuff after killing stuff, while still maintaining some element of randomness to satisfy Blizzard's bizarre fetish with it? Well, by ripping off one of the better ARPGs in the market, of course!

Presenting: Influence Shards

So what are Influence Shards? They're essentially Conqueror's Exalted Orbs from Path of Exile. You see, one thing GGG has learned over the years is that RNG is fine, but too much RNG is not. It's more engaging for players to try and get very expensive currency that will limit the RNG when they are crafting than to have them spam cheap currency on an item thousands of time while hoping for that perfect roll. In the latest league, they introduced this new currency, which adds a new affix to your item from a specific pool of possibilities. So why not have this in WoW as well?

Influence Shards would be bought with currency obtainable from doing in-game activities and/or obtained through the activities themselves (like killing raid bosses/completing m+/winning arena or bg matches, etc). There would, of course, be a cap to how much you could acquire every week. 

There would be 4 different types of Influence Shards, one representing each of the Covenants present in the Shadowlands. These shards are consumed to add a new effect to your item of choice, from a pool of general traits + a pool of role traits. General traits would be stuff like extra secondary stats or generic procs, much like what we have with corruption today. Role traits would be more interesting and generally what the playerbase would be fishing for. 

Each Influence Shard's role traits would be themed around the Covenant they represent. Ideally, they would be as similar as possible in terms of strength so players don't feel forced to go for a specific Shard. These Shards would NOT be tied to your Covenant of choice, meaning you could ""represent"" Kyrian while still using Necrolords Influence Shards. 

A few examples of possible role traits:

Now, one of the good things about the corruption system is that there is a drawback if you get too much of it. Here, there is nothing of the sort, so instead players could simply be limited to 2-3 influenced pieces equipped at any given time. This allows players to eventually dump their resources into getting whatever influence they want/is considered BiS.",9,1583855692,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fgfyea/suggestion_bringing_back_player_joy_from/,wow,1

I have exorsus Raidtools installed but havent set it up properly yet, because I dont know what a good layout would look like.

So, to the question:  


Do anyone of you have a good profile I can import to my Exorsus Raidtools or to my ElvUI, that tracks each individual players CD, neatly arranged near my raidframes?

fgdm7y,CFMcGhee,Guide for New 120s,"Doesn't matter if it's your very first 120, or an alt, dinging to 120 now opens up a broad range of possibilities for your new max-level character. I see questions every day here on ""What do I do now?"", so I've put together this brief guide.  If you have any suggestions/comments/ideas, please leave constructive feedback below.

Once you get to 120, 

* If you have Black Empire/Benthic catch-up gear, equip it now
* Don't worry about your neck level, it will get jumped to 50 in a few steps
* Do the war campaign far enough to unlock daily quests.  
* Either run around a bit, or log out and back in to trigger the Nazjatar intro quest line.  Do that until you get the azurite armor piece (not Benthic)
* If you DIDN'T have any catch up gear, start the quest to unlock benthic gear and the upgrader.  DO NOT UPGRADE THE ITEM YOU GOT.  Instead, take the Manapearls and buy more gear.  This gear is 385, and you should have an Azurite item (quest reward), pants (from quest), and four more pieces you chose to buy (don't get a cloak)
* Do the quest line to unlock Essences (Magni).  Bumps you neck to level 50 and gives you your first Essence
* Do world quests/World Bosses to get Trinkets, rings, weapons, armor (in that order, but skip any quests with cloaks as rewards).  This will help to get your item level up to be able to do more content.
* Do the quest line to introduce the Black Empire invasion.  You may need to get some help on parts of the quests if your item level is below 400.  You will get more gear, including a very nice artifact cloak.

Once you have gotten the cloak, you are free to focus on what you want to.  Essences mainly come from the Nazjatar/Mechagon content, but if you hold off on that for a bit, you can do the patch 8.3 World Bosses for nice loot, then go back and get the essences you need a little easier.",62,1583846051,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fgdm7y/guide_for_new_120s/,wow,1

fgc24v,Korgan13,What if essences (and similar) were recursive for your account per major patch?,"Don't know if anyone's suggested it, but what if the idea of essences and similar were recursive per patch?  

Meaning: what if a new mechanism is introduced per patch, and it becomes account-wide the next patch, repeating through the expansion?  Reworking 8.x/BFA as follows for an example:

8.0 - Basic Essences introduced.  (All DPS Essences could be similar regardless of class, repeat for Tank and Healer).  Basic Essences are gained from Normal/Heroic dungeons, PVP, Revered Rep, etc. 

8.1 -  Basic Essences become account-wide.  Advanced Essences are introduced and gained from Raids, Mythic dungeons, Exalted Rep, etc......the harder stuff.




8.2 - Advanced Essences becomes account-wide.  Flying introduced with new zones.  

8.3 - Legendary Cloak introduced with Corruption-Resistance levels.

8.4 - Cloak levels become account-wide at a decent point before  targeted Shadowlands release date.  Shadowlands pre-patch experience introduced.  

This seems like an easy way to allow players to work towards a goal, but not have to endlessly grind per toon.  It would still allow the concept of AOTC for each mechanism for an entire patch, but allow greater range for users to play their alts later in the game.

fgapfg,gustavperuses,"Let me share with you, my vision of Warcraft's future after Shadowlands - 10.0","**PRELUDE - THE TIME SKIP**

In the Shadowlands, time behaves in strange ways. Days spent within the Shadowlands are years on Azeroth, so if you dwell for too long you might experience a large time skip when you come back.

A large theme of the Shadowlands expansion is imprisonment. The Jailer sits within the Maw, trapping souls to feed... something.

At the end of the expansion, during an event introduced with the pre-patch, the players will become imprisoned within the Shadowlands. To us, it will only seem like a minute passes, just as it did within the Demon Hunter starting experience. Months will have passed, but we'll watch a cutscene and wake up a while later.

We'll break free from imprisonment and conjure a gateway back to Azeroth.

**PART 1 - THE RETURN**

Moments later, we emerge in a frozen wasteland. Next to us stands one of our allies from the realm of the dead, a Spirit Healer. She reveals to us that we've restored the machine of death, but we may not be ready for what awaits us. Whatever or whomever was responsible for the machine of death breaking in the first place had been able to fulfil its goal, and feasted on souls beyond reckoning.

The site of our arrival is under attack by agents of the Void. We fend them off and rally a small group of survivors who also arrived from the Shadowlands. Clearly, someone or something didn't want us to return. 

After the scenario is finished, a lookout from a nearby settlement reaches us and invites us back to his camp. It turns out he's the descendant of one of a few who were sent to live in Northrend after we went missing, years ago. The outpost he's a part of was setup to watch out for our eventual return. But over the years, they had stop hearing news from the rest of Azeroth. The ships had stopped coming, and the settlement had learned to adapt and fend for itself. 

We familiarise ourselves with this group known as the Last Watch, and from them we learn what little they know about the fate of Azeroth. Two-hundred years ago, they arrived in Icecrown. As far as they knew, the rest of the continent had been abandoned, and they rarely wandered. Looking at the horizon, we see a looming darkness in every direction.

They decide that their ancient duty is fulfilled and that there is nothing more waiting for them in Northrend. Together with the players, they rig the sails of an ancient vessel and set sail south.

**PART 2 - CONQUERED WORLD**

As the players and the Last Watch leave Northrend and travel to various familiar locations throughout Azeroth, it becomes clear to us that very few places remain accessible and free. Cities have disappeared, nations have fallen, and land has become inaccessible. A shadow permeates everything we encounter. Strange creatures stir beneath the waves.

We unearth clues and slowly piece together the puzzle of what transpired on Azeroth since we left.

* It's been two-hundred years since we entered the Shadowlands. Several characters we knew are long-since dead, although some survived due to the fact that they were with us in imprisonment.
* Yogg-Saron was behind Sylvanas' corruption to feed souls into the Maw. He was feeding Mueh'zala, a Void Lord, so it would be able to manifest in our world. We eventually defeated Yogg-Saron, and thus all the original Old Gods were dead. Their tendrils buried deep into Azeroth, they were able to feed their spirits in death to the Void Lord, and subsequently allowed it to corrupt the final titan from within.
* Anduin, in his later days, had mustered a final desperate attempt to defeat the Void at its source. Along with Velen and many of the Draenei, he travelled aboard the Vindicar into the Great Dark Beyond. That was some 150 years ago, and no one had heard from them since. This story is told in one of the pre-release animated shorts leading up to the expansion.
* A few pockets of resistance still remain and cling on to hope. 
* Tyrande Whisperwind leads the Army of the Black Moon inside the thick forests of Northern Kalimdor. The Void hasn't been able to conquer Mount Hyjal yet. 
* Silvermoon has fallen, but Blood Elves, Void Elves and High Elves are leading a guerrilla warfare effort against the shadow all across the Eastern Kingdoms. 
* Here and there, the mortal races are holding out among the ruins of their former glory. Ironforge stands as a refuge to some,  and the Tauren have been able to seek refuge inside a spirit-realm erected by the Earth-mother. There are lots of other examples of people struggling to survive against all odds.
* Stormwind and Orgrimmar have fallen, as the Visions of N'Zoth foretold.

**PART 3 - AZEROTH REBORN**

The Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor will be fully revamped over the course of the expansion. They'll be transformed into dynamic, modern, awesome continents which never get stuck in a particular timeline or feel dated after just a few years. But they'll be unlocked un chunks.

As we begin the expansion, a few zones are available to us. They've conquered, corrupted, or besieged by the Void. But one by one, we take them back and build a resistance force by recruiting all the various survivors throughout Azeroth.

As the expansion draws to a close, the new world is fully unlocked. 

Azeroth's world-soul will be cleansed and the Void Lord will be purged.

Other continents aren't revamped, but rather used for the 10-50 Era levelling system. Over time, some of them might get revamped.

We're left wondering what happened to Anduin, Velen and the other champions who had left to fight the Void in the Great Dark Beyond. It'll remain a mystery and an ongoing narrative thread as we ourselves eventually make out way out there to see if we can find them again.",13,1583829540,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fgapfg/let_me_share_with_you_my_vision_of_warcrafts/,wow,1

fg6axw,CosmologicalFluke,A Needed Lesson in Game Design: Burden of Optimal Play,"There's a great article I always refer to in regards to the Burden of Optimal Play, you can check the full article [here](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EdwardMcNeill/20140721/221443/Grinding_and_the_Burden_of_Optimal_Play.php) but when it comes to this game, it feels like this concept is being catastrophically botched in WoW and is causing a lot of the issues.

Some key quotes from that article

&gt; Players will tend to make the choices that lead most directly and surely to victory. If you set up a goal that players care about, you should expect them to try to reach it as efficiently as possible. If the most efficient way to win (i.e. optimal play) is a pain in the ass, then you’re asking players to accept a worse experience in exchange for victory, and that’s a crappy way to treat your players. 

&gt; The Burden of Optimal Play suggests a guideline for game designers: if you want the player to have fun, then the most effective path to victory should also be the most fun. Playing well should never result in a worse experience.

&gt; Keep in mind that it’s not necessarily repetition that’s bad. (Most great games are repetitive in one way or another.) Rather, the problem is mindless repetition.

That can mean a few things, it could mean doing something completely annoying that increases dps or falling for a trap like the developer who wrote the article did which is making his easier levels more rewarding than they should be, thus breaking the game loop. Fixing it meant rebalancing the rewards so players would move to the hardest level they could handle and not have to go back to the easy ones. You can see how this starts to relate to WoW now.

WoW has a habit of not letting you move out of the easier levels. When players that get World First kills like Method have to farm islands which are far below the level of difficulty they're playing at. Why? Why can't Mythic bosses just shower you with so much AP you never even needed islands? Or any player who's pushing +22-24 keys but has to do dailies and assaults because even though they are magnitudes easier, they still give rewards not obtainable through harder content.

WoW never quite gets it. Another example is how Horrific Visions work great but then just break. Once you 5 mask them, and then next week it gets even easier, the week after that it gets even easier. But you still need to clear them for each vessel. Up until you clear your 5 masks, they're a great system, after that, it went downhill. It becomes just a boring chore because the difficulty can only go down so they aren't engaging anymore. And they reward sockets, which are very powerful. You can't get that item that adds a socket to gear from any other place, but the gameplay loop of 8.3 visions.

That one is particularly sad because they almost nailed the challenging solo content that you can make more challenging for more rewards, but it just breaks and you still have to do non-challenging content to access it in the first place.

Essences. On paper they have ranks based on difficulty but not really. Because you can't just do the hardest content and you'll get essences bam done, you had to get them from their own thing. And re-get them, but that's another story. Rank 3 doesn't actually require you to do anything difficult for any essence, it just takes time. Not usually actual physical game time, work in game, just mostly waiting time for the next week or day to tick over.

And this is the issue, they insert in ""content"" that doesn't have even remotely a level of difficulty that keeps the player engaged enough not to be required to watch a tv show while playing to not get insanely bored. But they make it give rewards that are relevant for the highest levels of difficulty (like +24 keys) but can't actually be obtained from anything of that level of difficulty. And this is how you create Burden of Optimal Play traps like: Do you want sockets on all your gear? Farm Visions from easy content and stomp through Horrific Visions at a lower difficulty than when you cleared them because the cloak sanity protection increased. There's no other way of obtaining that extra power.

A good example of a system that does NOT break the Burden of Optimal play is gear from Emissary quests. Because there's no need to go back to that level of non-difficulty once you have gear from a higher difficulty. That's a system that works, and doesn't cause issues.

If you read any post around here it's like ""don't go minmaxing your character and you'll be fine"" and that's exactly what the Burden of Optimal Play is, it's about minmaxing your character and what *exactly* that entails. Which generally this expansion, especially 8.3 is doing content at too easy of a difficulty level. That's the main issue with stuff like dailies, that they require no thought. They're boring because they are not remotely challenging for the people who are looking to min-max their character with full sockets. They're just fly around, click thing, kill mob that has no hope of killing you unless you afk for 2 minutes while fighting it.

Mind you this is not a BfA only problem. In Legion, the most effective way to gain AP was doing a lower level Maw of Souls over and over again. It's oversights like that that often create the Burden of Optimal Play.

**Okay but what's the answer then? TL:DR? ** - Don't reward lower difficulty content with better or exclusive things than more difficult content, so that people don't have to go backwards to content that now feels like a chore because it doesn't engage the player. Adjustable difficulty, increasing rewards. It's a formula that works. It encourages people to move forward. If you have to make daily single player content, make it have a scalable difficulty that you can play with. Imagine going to do your dailies and actually having to pay attention to the game whatsoever. Or if that is too much development work to make challenging outdoor content, make it like an option, you can get your daily resource (like Coalescing Visions) by either doing all the dailies OR doing an M+ OR doing an arena or two, etc. But IMPORTANTLY, it's pick *one*, you shouldn't be able to stack them because that makes it worse since the optimal route becomes doing it all.

The point is, even if they want to keep you logging in with some daily task and reward, insert all your playtime investors jokes here, **it doesn't have to suck as much.** It can be more engaging by giving you an appropriate task that actually engages you. Maybe even the task you logged in to play in the first place. That's how you design a good game, it's a game that reinforces you doing things that are fun. Not one that rewards you for doing the most boring part repeatedly.",54,1583805504,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fg6axw/a_needed_lesson_in_game_design_burden_of_optimal/,wow,1

fg5ww7,RedoLeme,"My biggest gripe is realizing that we won't ""outgear"" assaults for months","Even at 445, some corruptions are still worth using. 

Unless you have both your perfect m+ and raid sets all with a socket, you still have to do assaults / dailies to get into visions for mementos to buy sockets for every piece. 

Even assuming your character can get 1 socket a week (Mains probably, but unless you put some serious time into alts it's going to be rough), it will still take you anywhere 11-22 weeks assuming your gear isn't socketed and 2 sets. 

Oh, and you got the same item but with a corruption or higher ilvl because weekly chest? Add another week. 

Yes, old titanforging had a chance that even world quest gear could titanforge up to gear cap (iirc it was +100 ilvls at cap, even though the chance of that was practically winning the lottery), so technically if you wanted to ""maximize"" chance at gear you would have done everything, but eventually the chances was so low it just wasn't worth your time doing, and you weren't penalized for it. Occasionally you saw someone with a WTForge but it was once in a blue moon. 

Now with the 8.3 assaults and dailies... you're never going to outgear them until you're literally in your BIS gear in every slot except azerites of course. 

tl:dr you are not ever ""done"" with assaults/visions until you're in your 100% BIS gear in EVERY slot",13,1583803844,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fg5ww7/my_biggest_gripe_is_realizing_that_we_wont/,wow,1

fg4z2f,portjoe914,Is there anywhere to go to play old raids?,"Hi Everyone,

I recently just started playing WoW again, and have not played regularly since 2011. I’m playing on my first ever character, an orc hunter, who i made in 2009, and because of the large gap in my playing he is only level 75. When i was playing at first i only had vanilla and for that reason i missed out in pretty much all the endgame content of the base game and early expansions.

I’ve started also playing classic wow for this reason but it’s such a slow grind it will take me a long time to get to 60.

In retail wow it’s impossible to find groups who will do these old raids. I know it’s easy to solo them when i get to higher levels, but I’d really like to experience them the way they were meant to.

My question is, are there any dedicated servers or groups for people who want to do old (vanilla, BC, and wrath) content? Thanks in advance for any help!",12,1583799939,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/fg4z2f/is_there_anywhere_to_go_to_play_old_raids/,wow,1

What happens is that there is some sort of fluid in between each joint, and in those fluid bubbles form. The bubble popping sound you hears when cracking is exactly that; the bubbles in the fluid popping. Other than annoying someone there isn’t a real risk of cracking knuckles or any joint. It usually takes about 20mins for the bubbles to reform. Give or take ofc... a doctor won an IG Nobel prize for cracking his left hand knuckles consistently for 50 years to prove it doesn’t cause Arthritis or do long term damage. His left hand was as good as the right one which he didn’t crack. Which also goes to prove that even if you don’t crack you’re good. But 50 freaking years,that’s dedication.

fg12bn,AustrianGamer,Account wide Essences (Volume 1.000.000),"This is probably the one millionth post about account-wide Essences but I had a pretty weird moment yesterday that I wanted to know your thoughts on.

So, as many of you will do, I normally start leveling my characters as soon as I reach my in-game goals for the expansion on my main. For me that's Ahead of the Curve and (this time around) the +15 mount.

I finished this on my main the day before yesterday (not going to lie, TD +15 took me a ridiculous amount of attempts - like, an embarrassing amount of tries). Anyways, as I've done every expansion since Wrath, I wanted to get started on leveling my other characters. And then - I didn't.

I sat there for a while looking at the character-selection-screen and then just switched the game off. I thought about it and I think it is the prospect of having to grind out Essences on every single character that really put me off. I like to have my characters on a reasonably high power level for an expansion launch so that I can choose solely based on what I liked during Beta. 

I did this at the end of Legion as well, despite Legendaries because you were somewhat up to speed as long as you didn't get owned by RNG on your first two Legos.

So, TL;DR: I think Essences are going to influence what I'll be playing in Shadowlands. And I don't like it.

ffzkl4,Noobinated,What happened to Sylvanas’s voice?,"When I played Warcraft 3, before WoW, the voice of Sylvanas Windrunner was different from the current Sylvanas’s voice. 

From Warcraft 3 up to the end of Wrath of the Lich King the voice actress for the Dark Lady was voiced by: Piera Coppola. 

Then when Cataclysm came out her voice was completely changed to: Patty Mattson.

I remember doing the undead quest line for Silverpine Forrest, when Cata first came out, where you and The Dark Lady are riding to the next quest-check-point and she begins to talk about her hatred for Arthas, etc, etc and basically uses you as a therapist. 

I remember when she first started talking I was like, whoa! What the freak happened to your voice!! I honestly didn’t like it. 

I thought the voice was whiny, annoying, and reminded me of Karen Walker from Will and Grace. Ugh. But as time went on I just accepted it and it became the norm. 

It didn’t occur to me that a change happened when Warcraft 3 came out and they kept the original voice of Sylvanas by: Piera Coppola. 

So...what did happen to the voice of Sylvanas? Why did they change it? 

IIRC, Blizzard really treats their voice actors / actresses like shit. In the sense of they don’t pay them that well. And if they ask for a raise blizzard has no problem saying: “nope. Sorry.” 

Do you guys remember the old voice of Sylvanas? Do you like the new voice actress? Do you even care? Hahaha. 

I still find Sylvanas, both voice wise and lore wise, to be an annoying son of a b%#!h.

ffz1om,AugustoCSP,Best patch of BfA,"Now that Beta for Azerite is finally over, I think we can all take a step back and judge the expansion in retrospect from an impartial point of view. I mean, sure, the expansion as a whole was a steaming pile of shit, but wanted to know, what was, in your opinion, the best/least bad patch/tier of BfA?

Personally, I think 8.1 Battle of Dazar'alor/Crucible of Storms was JUST the sweet point. And, like many will be tired to hear about, it was the most alt friendly patch.

During 8.1, I maintained a total of 12 characters ready to tackle a full heroic raid/first few bosses of mythic. There were several reasons for that:

*The addition of the second azerite ring made it easier to get those ""Have at least one of"" traits.
*There was a cap to the neck grind, and you could easily get enough AP by just passively checking on the mission table
*I know this will be controversial, but the cap to the weekly chest being 10 instead of 15 meant ALL of my characters usually completed a key at least 1 or 2 levels above the cap, which gave me a +10 or higher key the next week, allowing me sell M+ runs.
*There was minimal grinding required, given that we had the 2nd azerite ring, but still no essence/cloak grind that feel like a job to keep a character up to date.
*In order to keep a character up to date, all you had to do was log in once a week and do one 10 or higher keystone dungeon. Maybe log in every day for a few seconds to check the mission table/contribute to the warfronts, WHICH WERE ALL 5 SECONDS AWAY from where most of everyone logs out (For Alliance, at least.)
*The raid was actually pug friendly, requiring little communication once the strategy had been set, with the sole exception of Mekkatorque - a fairly late boss into the raid.
*There wass good loot in the very first boss of the raid, meaning you could pug the first boss of mythic only to jumpstart your gearing - INCLUDING A PIECE OF AZERITE GEAR, and a pretty good one for most specs. In Ny'alotha, there's a severe loot draught, with a total of ONE SHIELD IN THE ENTIRE RAID, and in a VERY late, pug unfriendly boss (Ill'gynoth). For Warlocks, for example, Drest'agath drops a total of ONE ITEM - even then only because it drops for all classes, a ring.


Of course, no patch is perfect, and the one thing that I didn't like in 8.1 was the lack of flying. I hated it, but it didn't make the game unplayable.

ffyefl,Artunias,Shadowlands needs to follow a weekly model instead of daily,"As the title states my biggest feedback here is Shadowlands needs to base almost everything you do on a weekly lockout basis. Stop trying to get us to login every day. A few thoughts for what that would look like to me.

**Anima**

The new AP. Honestly, I think AP has worked decently well for most of Legion and and BfA, but it has definitely had a few shortfalls. The biggest points I would make for Anima are as follows.

- Weekly caps for power progression
- If you come in 4 weeks late, you should be able to grind out all 4 weeks in one week. There might be a point of catch-up where it's extremely difficult to catch up if you're a few months behind or something, but the main point here is there shouldn't be any artificial caps on this catch-up mechanic.
- It's fine for it to exist as grindable currency for all kinds of things, but the power progression needs to be very easy to attain IMO and 100% catch-up for players that come in late or for alts, whatever
- There is *NOTHING WRONG* with the weekly power progression ending every patch cycle and picking up again later and having Anima only serve as an auxiliary currency for a few months between patches.

**World Content**

I think the N'zoth assaults can be used as a model for progression going forward. Every zone in Shadowlands needs to have a bar you can fill. Those zones need to be filled with events, rares, quests, world quests, objectives, etc very much like Assaults are (be cool to see how they might expand on that idea though). But the main point here is that you should be able to do all kinds of stuff in the zone to fulfill your objective. Hop in with people doing stuff, go kill that rare mob, if you want to finish a daily/world quest or two after you fill your bar then so be it. You have that option.

Again your primary reward for the week would be a weekly reward for each questing zone. Emissary style rewards that stack up over several days I think is still a fine model to promote some additional rewards (but should still be based on the assault model of filling a bar with a wide range of activities of your choice). But the main focus should be on the weekly bar fill for each zone. Maybe you do them all in one day, maybe you spread it out. You can still go get more minor rewards every day. Maybe you're helping a friend, maybe it's their alt, maybe you just feel like killing stuff in that zone. There is a reward structure here where after the weekly reward it doesn't feel like wasted time, but is not a huge reward either (kinda thinking like what Islands are after the weekly cap). Some kind of currency, a bit of rep, gold, whatever.

I think there's a broader vision here where they can also use this model to reinvigorate world content. Doing the N'zoth assaults feels good to me while I'm filling the assault bar. I think the zones feel pretty bland just hunting a few dailies (that kinda suck IMO), but the assaults themselves are a pretty solid model.",202,1583775423,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ffyefl/shadowlands_needs_to_follow_a_weekly_model/,wow,1

ffxtcw,bongstruck,I'm really sick of half of the raid groups in the LFG tool advertising that they are selling raid runs.,"Back when I started playing in WotLK, Trade Chat used to be a place where you could find people to join your raid. Everybody obviously wanted to do the content so it made sense to advertise that you wanted people to join your group for the purpose of doing the content itself.

Now we have the LFG tool, I think its great, way easier to use, tells the leader your item level off the bat and the best part is, you can use it anywhere. You dont have to pay 15 bucks a month to sit in a main city and hope you can join a raid that night.

However, it seems that nearly half of the postings on the LFG tool today are advertising that some AOTC guild is selling Mythic raid runs for either gold or actual currency. Idk if its against the games ToS to sell runs for gold, I doubt it is. Selling raid runs for real money is cheating and it kinda pisses me off. 

I spent  a lot of time joining raids, getting gear, farming and even just learning the fights on Youtube to get where I'm at today in the game. I'm not complaining, I love this game and find the process of building your character fun as hell. But the fact that there is a high amount of people selling the raid runs means that some people must be buying them. If thats the case then what the fuck.

* I bought a WoW token to get professions like enchanting but found no money in it
* I bought two WoW Tokens after to celebrate the 100k i got the first time and the first million
* I got lucky once with a Inf Stars BOE and sold it for 1.3 million
* I sold runs with Gallywix for almost 2 million. Great group of people, would recommend them and the runners are generally nice to advertisers.
* I will continue to farm mats just not as much since i hit this milestone but since i have the AH mount I can just enjoy it and passivley do it and be more efficient
* Thank you for everyone who followed along, it has been a blast on here sharing my story. if you all have any questions leave them below.

From the beginning when he stood up to Sylvannas at Teldrassil, to his speech with the troll kid, to his interactions with Anduin and Thrall, to his grand finale at the Org gates, it all just gives the impression to me that the writers and animators and actors all really cared about his story. I'm not even a horde player but I felt so much more for him than I did for Jaina or Anduin.  


I think Saurfang's Mak'gora cinematic is better than any of the expansion opening cinematics, but it's partly because all of the Saurfang cinematics built on each other so well.

ffv1tl,justbounce1,M+ Keystone failures should effect whole party,"When a party starts a keystone, the whole party should have ""skin in the game.""

From building 30-50 PUGs in the 10-15 keystone bracket this season, I can comfortably say this appears to be one of the most toxic places to be in gaming. It's hard content, even if people like to pretend it isn't, in an uncoordinated group.

The huge issue is that with a complete lack of accountability or punishment of any kind when leaving a group, there is a large contingent of players who are willing to spoil a key within minutes of starting it. Everyone will have seen the excuses - the route isn't to their preference, the pulls aren't ambitious enough, someone stood in the fire, &lt;insert any typical fail here.&gt;

**My suggestion is that if a keystone is begun by another player in a group of five, the keystones in your own backpack should be at risk of taking a -1 hit.** 

I think if a keystone depletes, but the last boss is killed, only the leader should take the -1 hit to their key. But something needs to be done to combat the ever-growing contingent of players perfectly comfortable to leave a run within minutes of the challenge beginning and ruining a night of progression. An example being a group starting a +15 with the main goal of timing the run, but happy to complete the run to keep learning about the game and/or score a weekly best chest.

In my group of friends who like to push keys, 3 out of 5 have quit due to the behaviour and attitude of the M+ community. A few setbacks, sure, but this experience of fools leaving runs more often than they try to complete them is truly killing the community of players hoping to push harder content.",53,1583762313,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ffv1tl/m_keystone_failures_should_effect_whole_party/,wow,1

ffuol2,Leftwing_agitator,Cool stuff,"Here are some cool ideas for the game. They are non-combat RP and social items. Your input is desired!

1. Tome of comprehend X. These are craftable tomes, and they allow you to comprehend X language for 1 hour. They don't allow you to speak it, and the language barrier is still there if the other player doesn't also have a tome of comprehend language that translates your words. But at least, you can listen. Included are common, orcish, shath'yar, etc...
2. Scroll of gibbering thoughts. This is a fun one. It is a craftable scroll can be cast on both allies and enemies, and places the debuff gibbering thoughts on them for 5 minutes. It forces a player to also /say whatever they were going to say in any other chat channel. The gibbering thoughts debuff is visible. One thing to note, casting gibbering thoughts does not break stealth, prowl, shadowmeld, or any type of disguise. Combined with tome of comprehend X, it allows you to spy on the enemy!
3. Contract of N'zoth. This is a craftable contract, that can only be crafted by inscriptionists that have their tools of the trade. Using this contract places the binding of N'zoth on a player for 30 minutes. When bound to N'zoth, players take on the form of a K'thir Cultist. They appear neutral to enemy players, and no longer display their player name. Instead, they are simply called K'thir. K'thir are neutral to town guards, and like servants of nzoth, speak shath'yar. Only usable in open world.
4. Scroll of the corrupted mind. This is a craftable scroll that can be cast on enemy players. It increases their corruption by 5, and forces them to use the Shath'Yar language for 3 minutes. It does not grant comprehension of Shath'yar. Using this consumable does not break stealth, prowl, or shadowmeld. Only usable in open world.
5. Scroll of void portal. This craftable consumable creates a void portal for 3 minutes. All players regardless of faction can use the void portal to enter the void. While in the void, players corruption is increased by 1 every 15 seconds. Also, players take increasing damage over time. If the portal to the void expires, and you don't have another portal scroll, you can hearth or teleport out, or you will die. If you die in the void, your body is dumped back to reality. Also, there are rare monsters that can occasionally be found roaming the void and drop really nice loot....
6. Elixir of void immunity. This is a craftable Elixir that grants immunity to the effects of being inside a void portal for 15 minutes.",2,1583760670,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ffuol2/cool_stuff/,wow,1

ffrkqb,toadsanchez420,"Returning player, looking for some advice","I played Wow from BC to WOTLK, for about 4 years.

I played as a Dranei Hunter and then a Death Knight, and that was about it.   But I am familiar with a good portion of the game. 

I just started again on Dalaran WoW as an Orc Hunter, and while I'm only level 16, I have a few questions.  For those that don't know, Dalaran WoW is Vanilla, Burning Crusade, and WoTLK. So I'm not interested in anything past that.

I'm playing alongside my roommate whenever she's on, and she's running a Druid with Alch/herb, and I'm currently doing Skinning/LW.  I remember doing Borean Leather/Arctic Fur/Chilled Meat runs and I loved it.  I know LW will help me until I get to 80, but after that, it seems useless for personal utility and it would seem like I can make more money on the AH by selling the Skinning mats, and not even touching LW.  Even if I CAN make good money with LW at 80, I was wondering if there was something more useful I could pair with Skinning.  I prefer to have a gathering profession along with a crafting profession, so dropping one means I have to find another in it's place.  Obviously these two worth well together.  

I'm not looking for something that provides a ton of money, but the more the better.  I want to try and collect mounts.  

I don't really care for the profession bonuses, I'm not looking to have the best stats, just some fun while playing.

I'd love to have enchanting but tailoring would probably be best to go with that, and farming for cloth is a lot less fun than for leather.  But Enchanting was definitely one of the funnest professions, and so was Engineering but I'd need mining to go along with that, same goes for JC and BS.  

Having Skinning and Mining seems extremely lucrative but then I'd never get to make anything, and that's why I love crafting in games, making cool stuff for others and myself.  When I switched over to GW2, I was disappointed that I couldn't mass produce health potions for the AH.

So, I guess I'm looking for a good pair to make money from both professions alongside each other, without the need for an alt I'd have to level, although that is an option further down the line.  

I'm also curious if there's any need to try and do every quest in a zone or should I just move along with my level?

ffoyjr,bodyxbagged,Destro Arena questions incoming.,"Alright, I just came back to the game about two weeks give or take and I’m noticing some changes to the dynamic. Not so much the game itself but the play style and what you see in the ladder which I haven’t been able to climb very high yet. 

Now that that is out of the way time for the MAIN question. I play destruction which is very fun for 100-0 players easily but I am in the 1550 area and I’m noticing that 1550 players are a lot smarter than 1550 players back in the day, maybe because of all the addons that tell you what your opponent is doing maybe not. As Destro everyone knows we can blow any class in the game up in a matter of 4-5 cast so I have gotten to the point where everyone I que into will make their “go” on me I’ll counter pressure with a bolt or two when their go fails they pillar hump/los until all their defensive and offensives are back up and make another go. They do this until their go works or until I get a lucky double coil where they run the direction I need them to to land a fear on the healer and blow the DPS up more times than not the aforementioned happens. You used to not see people play like this until 1750ish range.

I’m assuming it’s not the same this go around due to me seeing quite a few 120s running the service this xpac.

Long story short, I’m in the process of setting up Multiboxing and if I was able to carry my freshly boosted 110 team through Freehold without XP penalties from having a max level toon, that’d be great.

ffn55j,Leftwing_agitator,Hunter pets (and pets in general),"Hunter pets (pets in general) are bullshit. We are expected to ignore the damn things, and focus the player. Yet these critters have a health bar that so far, is always targeted with tab targeting. But more annoying than that, they are easy to summon and hard to kill. At least death knights minions (aside from abomination) have a cooldown.

Pets in general, and hunter pets in particular need a nerf to survivability in pvp. It takes the hunter 1.5 seconds to resurrect their pet, but it takes us 10 seconds to kill the damn thing! In the wild, these same pets get one shot by reaping flames, but the instant the hunter puts a collar on it, it gains 200k hp, and suddenly takes less damage than before. &gt;:\[  


Pets should be killable with moderate amounts of effort. A chaos bolt should one hit KO them from 100 to 0. Same for a charged up reaping flames. Pets should die. No more immortal pets. &gt;:(",8,1583718405,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ffn55j/hunter_pets_and_pets_in_general/,wow,1

ffmc13,throwaway33426929,Leveling just by doing Dungeons and other questions,"Hey,

I just played the first free 20 Levels of WoW and I'm still unsure if I want to play it.

There are still some questions that I need answers for before I can decide.

Can I level up to max level just by doing dungeons? Who saw my earlier posts knows that I found questing **really** boring but I actually had fun for the first time playing dungeons after I hit level 15. Currently I stopped playing because I don't want to waste experience. So can I just do dungeons to level without having to do any quest ever again? How would it be like? I mean without questing most parts of the map stay hidden or not? Can I still do all lategame stuff then?

I don't really understand the dungeons menu but is there something I have to look out for? How can I reenter a dungeon if I accidentally left through the portal?

I also noticed that clicking on enemys is pretty difficult sometimes and spamclicking abilitys is pretty annoying. Do other people do something different here?

Another thing I worry about a lot is the race and class of my character. Currently I play a Blood Elf Mage. Is this good? Is it bad? I don't really want to repeat the first 20 levels with other characters again because I really want to avoid doing the same stuff again. What I also might like is a warlock and maybe a hunter. Idk I just think about what I played in games like League of Legends and my playstyle in these games. Should I stick with what I have or should I play something else?

For no real reason I'm also thinking about the server I'm playing on. Idk I don't want to waste time (or money) because I made a msitake there. Currently I'm playing on a server with a high population but I don't really know what that means. Is it like ""good enough"" compared to a full server? Am I fine? I saw that servers are sorted by languages. On my german server people mainly speak english so is this relevant? Are their specific servers for languages I don't know or am I also fine here?

What if people I want to play with are on a different server or even worse if people are spread on many different servers? Currently I know noone but that might be a future problem.

How long do I need to play until I can actually play with other people? So basically max level I think. Is there something else I need for lategame stuff?

Is finding a group or even friends hard? (for a shy introverted person with some kind of social anxiety)

What is the best way of buying the game?

What if I stop paying the subscribtion? Can I lose my progress? Can I even access my characters and play?

This is a pretty special question but because I would like to ask a WoW player about it I think I'm fine including it here. How does WoW compare to Final Fantasy XIV and should I try that one too? Which do you think is better and why?

&amp;#x200B;

Before someone even mentions this: I already tried looking up guides but they are way too longer, way too complicated and I often don't understand special words of the MMO genre. I don't really understand why people even make guides if they just use language that only other people that already know this genre well can follow and understand.",9,1583714775,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ffmc13/leveling_just_by_doing_dungeons_and_other/,wow,1

fflbn2,Liraaell,Allied race DK customization options (and lack thereof),"The allied race Death Knights feel very unfinished and lazy. The only thing that separates a Zandalari DK and a Zandalari Warrior is the eye glow. So, what if there was actual effort put into the customization of the allied race DKs?

What if Nightborne DKs had more of a Withered/Nightfallen look to them, or at least a similar face/skin customization? Yeah they're not addicts anymore but withering away isn't exclusive to mana addiction, and it'd make sense to slowly fall apart after being artificially brought back to life. 

What if Highmountain DKs, instead of their tribal warpaints, had death runes painted/etched onto their horns and fur, and little relics/bones/whatever added into their hair instead of feathers to symbolize their transformation into the undead? 

What if Lightforged DKs (for whatever bs reason they're allowed to exist) had their Lightforged details- tattoos, golden pieces- look faded out, depleted or even scarred, showing that the Light abandoned them in the undeath? Bonus points if the Light runes on their foreheads are changed so one could choose between Unholy, Frost or Blood runes instead.

What if Void Elves (again for whatever bs reason they're allowed to exist) had something similar to the LFD, where the ""Void"" effects in their hair were replaced with some, I don't know, cool undeath particles, similar to what we see in ICC, or just had the tips be frosted, or bloody, or unhealthy withered and green.

What if Mag'har orcs, again, instead of tribal warpaints, had runic warpaints, or some customization that resembled the first gen DKs (Gul'dan's DKs)?

What if Dark Irons had the flaming eyes/beards replaced with a frosty aura, or anything else DK related for that matter, showing that the gift from Ragnaros don't god damn work in undeath? They could also have parts of their bodies reinforced with metal, considering they're brilliant blacksmiths. 

What if Zandalar DKs had more of a bony/rotten look to them, or skull warpaints similar to the aesthetic of Bwonsamdi?

What if Kul Tiran DKs had a ""rotten"" option using the thin human model, or at least a skin option similar to that of the drowned/undead Derek Proudmoore? Hell, something resembling the Drust aesthetic would be super cool as well. 

What if Vulpera DKs had different versions of pale, or weathered, or just generally ""ruined"" fur options, or more of a feral look to them?

And finally, what if Mechagnome DKs ~~didn't exist~~ had rusted robotic parts, or parts that looked like they were salvaged and barely put back together after their death, or had the stupid damn pincer arms replaced with something like giant claws or axe/sword hands that would change model according to what weapon you had equipped. What if the robotic eyes changed based on spec- from glowing red to blue to green?

TLDR;
WHAT IF ALLIED RACE DKS ACTUALLY HAD SOME EFFORT BEHIND THEM AND WERE ACTUALLY FUCKING COOL, BLIZZARD.

ffkqay,kitesoka,I'm so lonely.," I rejoined WoW about 2 months ago, and I'm ready to quit again.

I just can’t bear to play this game like a single player anymore.

There’s no conversations going on in general chat, just people selling runs. I joined a large guild, but no one talks. Obviously when running LFD or LFR it’s a shock to the system if anyone says hi.

I tried running some legacy raids with people, but they just run in, kill the boss, complain that they didn’t get the mount and then leave. Last time I asked if we were doing a full run, and I got a barrage of sarcastic abuse – “did you even READ the title”, which was something like ‘FJDfd DOG RUN AR/H/A/4/?’ which makes absolutely no sense to me because I don’t understand the acronyms. I've craeted groups for world bosses/group quests, and when someone joins I say ""hi, on my way 10 secs"" and hop a flightpath to take the 10 second journey over to that part of the map - but because I'm not immediately there, they leave 5 seconds in without saying a word.

I figured I needed a better guild, and I tried posting on the forums, looking up raiding websites, and posting in chat. But the ‘social’ guilds are just strangers being invited and then leaving not long after, where the conversation is always ‘hi’, ‘hey’, ‘hey’, and not much more. I want to get into raiding but everyone is doing latest patch mythic or heroic – I’m trying to pick up every piece of gear I can get solo and by queing, but I’m not geared enough for anyone and I don’t know the raids. I’d love to join a casual raiding group still doing normal raids from previous patches, mythic dungeons and such, but they don’t seem to exist! 

In the last 2 months I met one person who I had a chat with while out in the world, but they were on a different server. So, after they left the area they were gone forever.

I’ve dipped into each expansion to quest and see the story, but I haven’t played end game since WOTLK. I miss the days of Vanilla/TBC/WOTLK when I had so many friends, when general chats were full of conversation, when running a dungeon meant actually socialising with people for a good hour and a half, there were entry-level raiding guilds and people were always pugging early raids even when the last patch was out.

It feels so lonely and empty. Even though I see players around me, they all feel like ghosts.

It’s the same on low pop and high pop servers - I have characters on both.

I quit for the first time in early-Cata once my guild disbanded, my real life friends left and LFD ruined the social aspect of dungeon running. I always come back for each expansion but I ALWAYS leave after reaching the level cap because the game just gets far too lonely and it just makes me sad to play. I tried to get my real life friends into the game but they were not interested – it’s an “old game”, “bad graphics”, “too complicated”.

I’d really like to get back into this game and enjoy it again but I just can’t without the social aspect. In the past I gave up easily and went to something else after a month or two, but now *I'm really trying* to get back into the game.

Will it get better in Shadowlands? Is the launch of a new expansion the best time to make friends? Do new guilds open up? I haven’t been here for a launch of an expansion since Cata so maybe that’s my problem.

I thought about playing classic and started levelling, but I missed the launch boom and I dont want to invest my time into it now just to realise 100's of hours in that my server has died.

I just want to play with some interesting people, preferably my age or around that. I didn't think with such a massively popular and famous MMO that it would be this difficult.",114,1583707882,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ffkqay/im_so_lonely/,wow,1

ffjcwn,Leftwing_agitator,Mechanics that are stopping flying combat,"So, it would be freaking amazing if you could fly and fight at the same time. There are some things that would need to change for that to happen. Here is a list. 

1. Being able to cast the mount action while moving. This is huge! being able to cast mount, while moving allows people to mount while falling, or gliding. 
2. Being able to cast while on another player. Again, this is huge. Being able to have a friend fly you around, while you rain firebolts on an enemy really changes the game in flight combat. 
3. Being able to get on another player while in combat. Again, this is huge. 
4. Having an ability that can reliably dismount other players. Again, a pretty big ask. Something like the Net-o-matic 5000, except instant cast, and usable while flying. If used while flying, it should probably dismount both players. 
5. No cooldowns on gliders. (obviously gliders are needed)
6. A more lenient in/out of combat system. If no hostile units are in 30 yards, and you haven't taken damage in the last 5 seconds... no combat!
7. Glider mechanics for slow fall and levitate. Slow fall and levitate should be steerable. 
8. Momentum preservation for slow fall and levitate.

ffjag3,leonardocelso,RIP my Blood Elf Alliance traitor transmog - Unequipped my tabard :(,"For years now my paladin has donned this spiffy transmog... Yeah, every plate wearer has access to the Imperial Plate set with a couple of other items and it's nothing special, but, if you look closely...

Yup. It's a horde character. In a Knight's Colors tabard. Back in BC there was a bug that lasted only a few days that allowed characters with their faction's correspondent rank to buy (and equip) tabards from the opposite faction. Ever since then, everything I did with this character had been a source of anxiety, because I knew the day would come when this bug would be fixed. So came WotLK... and the bug remained in place. The Cataclysm arrived, entire zones were destroyed... but the tabard held strong. I server transferred a few times... nada!

Every xpac was followed by the every present doubt: would my tabard still be there? And lo and behold, it held strong. Pandaria, WOD, Legion... and here we go, BFA arrived, the perfect expansion for a traitor character, a spy amongst the horde (altough I sorta neglected him as you can see from the gear, I was mainly playing another toon).

So alas, the day arrived. Not due to a patch, not due to a bug fix, not due to someone else reporting me (yup, there were people along the way that threatened me with this)... due only to my own stupidity, I was roaming in old Dalaran earlier today when I passed by the tabard vendor, and saw that there were many I met the requirements, but hadn't added them to my collection ever since the xmog system was put in place. ""Hah, what a nice opportunity to add to my collection"" I thought, or should I say, I didn't think, because the next thing you know, some I'm wearing some random Lower City tabard, and my Knight's Colors were in my bag, after over 10 years being worn, forevermore unequippable.

Yes, as a last resort I even pleaded to a GM to restore it to my tabard slot, to no avail. I've lost my personal Battle for Azeroth. It is time to choose sides, ditch the blue and wear the red with pride (not that I have much choice at this point). It's been a good run and I'll miss it...

ffhn5d,Leftwing_agitator,Personal void zone generator,"So, I had an idea for a pvp item that somewhat balances wpvp. The personal void zone generator. When this item is activated, it creates a void sphere with 10 million health. 

The void sphere creates a void field around it, that affects the caster, and all players of the opposing faction. The void field phases the caster into a void dimension, and is also chooses one enemy of the opposing faction (at random) to also be phased into the void. 

Walking outside of the range of the void zone phases people back into reality. The void sphere which creates the void zone can be targeted by players in both the void and the real world, so this won't stop a raid from murdering you. It will however allow you to successfully fight a team of 3v1 in a series of duels, and prevent them from ganging up on you.

ffh6ty,mr_feist,What would you be willing to give up for flying to be available right from the start of the expansion?,"I've been thinking for a very long time that it's pretty ridiculous that we get to skip the entire world by flying above it and on top of that we move at 310% speed while ground speed is 100%. On top of that you get a 20% extra from Pathfinder and Paladins and Death Knights get another 20%. We're just moving too fast. 

So what if the three tiers of flying skill where as follows: 100%, 130%, 160% and both Pathfinder and class passives were nerfed  to 10% bonus? We can still keep the 720% flight speed for flight masters - which I don't know if it's just a Legion and BfA thing or they've changed it for older flight paths too. If they haven't, they really should. 

But, we still get to skip the entirety of the world by flying above it. We've heard the excuse before with Argus. ""That place is too dangerous to fly around!"" With the Uldum and Vale invasions we've seen it in action: the worms on the sky remind us to not fly too high. But it's fine if you stay close to the ground. It keeps you engaged with the world even if you can get off the ground. It's great, its a perfect fit for an RPG. I wouldn't mind seeing more of this if it meant I can have flying and be done with pathfinder. 

Lastly, I'd like to see flying used  as a tool rather than a convenience. I'd like to see questlines where you earn the trust of a faction and in exchange they allow you to fly in their area. Not pathfinder lengthy but challenging at least. I'd like to see guards that threaten to dismount you and kill you if you fly too close to their place. I'd like to see flying play a role in accessing certain areas of the world for bonus stuff. 

What do you guys think? Would that be a fair trade-off? Any other ideas you might have?",19,1583694135,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ffh6ty/what_would_you_be_willing_to_give_up_for_flying/,wow,1

ffffnj,CellSaysTgAlot,Class choice - Pugging PvE content,"Hi r/wow, I'm coming back to the game after a looong hiatus because the other game I play doesn't do very well at keeping me raiding for the whole week (GW2). So I'm thinking of getting a bit more serious on WoW to fill the downtime between resets.

I'm mostly interested in pugging group PvE content (Raids, dungeons) and I'm one of those guys who will only play the top performing classes regardless of class fantasy because it inflates my ego to do well.

I got back to doing low level dungeons as monk and warrior (levelled both to 55 to see how I liked the classes) but the test was a bit inconclusive as I liked very much all specs on both. 

So, as I kinda like the gameplay anyways, I'd like to find an ""easy to lfg with"" class to use my instant lvl 110 on, a bit like Chronomancer or Druid for GW2, those classes you want to bring regardless of the encounter, since that'd be to fill downtime between weekly resets and I'd not want to lfg all day to get a group. Bonus points of course for classes that don't require a year of farming to start being effective (i had the impression Fire Mage was pretty much made by how high you got your ilvl) or classes that don't depend on super good specific encounter knowledge.

I don't really mind the role, I feel comfortable on dps and healing, althrough tanks seem really dependant on good encounter knowledge, which I guess means I'll suck hard at with a boosted character.

tl;dr: which class do I bump to 110 if all I want to do is pug raids and dungeons 2-3 days a week without too much lfging involved ?",5,1583687190,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ffffnj/class_choice_pugging_pve_content/,wow,1

My issue is that I can't seem to travel to kul'tiras which is a massive issue because I can't do m+ on that contient.
Before I stopped playing I'm fairly certain I didn't do the beginning of the war campaign and skipped most of it by chatting to papa Magni. I've done that Nazjatar crap and atm my quest log for the war campaign is telling me to do the lost honour storyline which I can't do till I get a follower to lvl 3.

Now here's where the problem lies, I think because I skipped the initial parts of the war campaign I don't have access to kul'tiras . When I talk to Tattersail, she gives me no option to travel there. There is no orange quests on my map save for the warfronts. I cannot figure out what i need to do to get access to the three zones on kul'tiras 

I'm very lost here :(

I found a temporary fix by accepting the first quest to do Mechagon which lets me travel to tiraguarde via Tattersail.

ffa2xx,LukyLucaz,Never feel like I complete something meaningful,"I’m a casual player who only played low-lvl content back in Wotlk and Cata, and I’ve levelled my first main (Tauren Paladin) to 120 a while ago. What I mostly enjoy in the game is feeling a part of the World of Warcraft by questing through zonds and completing a story. I also like gathering pretty transmogs and mounts for my character.

Having reached 120 was very bittersweet. I hardly feel like I’ve achieved anything meaningful. My character doesn’t feel particularly strong in current PVE content and the game keeps throwing overwhelming amounts of things I feel I “should” be doing and am missing out on.

I would like to reach a point where I can say I’ve achieved something solid on my character before going off alting. But in BFA’s current state I feel like a hamster in a wheel who is constantly trying to “catch up” with things. I never feel like I’ve reached an acceptable baseline.

To try and combat this feeling I’ve quested very heavily in Draenor and am very near to gaining flying there, giving me the feeling I’ve actually played through and “caught up” with that expansion and it’s story. I don’t really know what to do with myself, aside from going on boring grinds to see a virtual number tick up after that.

Thanks in advance",2,1583647603,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ff8iwf/question_regarding_the_horde_council_cinematic/,wow,1

ff85p4,JscJake,"Ogres, arguably the most devolved life-form","We all know how stupid Ogres are, and for my explanation I'll be using the term ""devolved"" mostly referring to intellect.

Ogre lineage and actually be traced back to the massive Giant, taller than a mountain called Grond. Grond was native to Draenor and was created by the Titan Aggramar when he saw the threat of the Evergrowth. The following story is very long and I recommend reading all of it but I'll mostly be summarizing. Grond kills an unnamed Sporemound which are basically the brains of the Evergrowth and the other 3 start attacking him. He makes the weakest Sporemound fall easily, the second is significantly harder to defeat and the third finally kills Grond.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](i5l7tyvardl41 ""The Death of Grond."")

This wasn't the end of Grond though, because from his body sprang the life-forms known to us as the Colossals, who eventually killed the third Sporemound suicidally by exploding themselves on top of it. The Colossals had large fragments being torn off of them in their fights against the Evergrowth and these fragments came to be known as the Magnaron

&amp;#x200B;

![img](v2pgha30sdl41 ""Drov The Ruiner, One of the most powerful Magnaron on Draenor."")

The Magnaron didn't exactly share the Colossals hatred toward the Evergrowth and pretty much did their own thing and even devolved into the Gronn, Ogron, Ogres and Orcs. Magnaron and Ogron eventually became extinct in the Main Universe. Ogres eventually formed the Gorian Empire and were actually considered an intelligent species for a while until the pressure of the Orc clans (mostly Warsong) and other races got to be too much for them and they only had outposts in the zones of Frostfire Ridge, Nagrand and finally Talador in the later days of the Gorian Empire. The Ogres actually had a separate unnamed continent to the southwest of the continent of Draenor (Draenor is used as the name of the continent and the planet) 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](62eqt2nntdl41 ""Red arrow is where the Ogre continent is"")

Towards the later days of the Gorian Empire and the early days of the Horde the Ogres were at their weakest when they were offered to join the Horde, some declined and some gladly joined but the most infamous Ogre to join the Horde was Cho'gall, Chieftain of the Twilights Hammer. Cho'gall joined the Horde under Gul'dan as an apprentice but later betrayed the Horde to learn the secrets of the Void and later sided with Deathwing and the Old gods but was killed in the Cataclysm expansion. The Ogres who sided with the Horde were led to Azeroth while the ones who stayed behind were either killed in the explosion that formed Draenor into Outland or kept trying to survive on their own in a strange world somewhat similar to Draenor that they now called Outland. The Ogres were a big asset to the Horde because of the powerful brute force and even some of the magic they used. 

Some Ogres decided to leave the Horde and form new clans in some places of the world but it seems that they started to slowly lose their past intellect, their language got sloppy and their best trait was to survive, they barely even had tactics in their fights now and adventurers defeated Ogres at every turn whether it was on Outland or Azeroth. Some Ogres actually have good understanding of language and tactics but there are very few of those. What happened to them? Why did their intellect become so terrible that they could barely even survive? An example of this is the Ogre named Mok'Morokk in the Swamp of Sorrows. He gives you a few quests and tells you that Rexxar made him chieftain of his clan but now that he doesn't need to fight as much he seems to be much more of a coward than the warrior Rexxar saw him as. He gives you some quests about finding some things in the village he lost because he was too scared to get them back himself and when the Black Dragons attacked his village he just moved north into the swamp instead of fighting them head on and you even battle him once but he runs away to never return once he sees he's almost lost the battle.

The Ogres are arguably the most devolved species in the Warcraft universe that we know of.",28,1583645500,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ff85p4/ogres_arguably_the_most_devolved_lifeform/,wow,1
