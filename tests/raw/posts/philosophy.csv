fs9ld7,thethinkingbird,"Alien theories, death, and curiosity","So, I have been thinking of writing this for a while now. I want to write about the gloomy days of the world lockdown phase. The apocalypse has begun. Yes, I have to be a little dramatic here because this is quite scary of time. Anyway, the situation at present has been caused due to virus infection by the very famous right now CORONA Virus. The disease is called COVID-19. Yeh, I know what u are thinking, this feels very technical name for a disease. Well, the researcher did not have time for a well thought out name. This started in January in China. And had spread all over the world now. Till now 37800 ppl have died. I won’t go deeper with details. Because I want u to do some work and go watch the news.

Now, I would like to have some fun with my grey cells rather than be depressed with the real world. My theories are going wild, I will tell you that. I have very high hopes as well as am sad for all the dyeing going on. One of my bloody theories is that this is an alien. Because this type of virus isn’t very popular. And only a few times it has gone wild. As if attacking every time with a better-equipped weapon. This time they came to win it seems. I also think this because we have no idea about aliens. Any creature that belongs to the outer part of the earth is alien. Who knows on the microscopic level it is advanced civilization just like humans? Which our beloved humans can’t decipher under the microscope. Another interesting thing I have come to realize is that we humans are very much like viruses. Leaching of the earth until its barren. Trying to jump from one place to another or even in search of another planet just like a virus would do for hosts. But what can we say it is for survival. Laws of survival, only the strongest will prevail.

Whatever, you know what will happen nothing crazy or miraculous where we are saved by the Gods or aliens like the olden time because for some reason gods and aliens are pissed with us which is why not showing miracles for quite some time now. Well, I was saying that this will definitely go down after some time with the help of scientists creating a vaccine for sure. I know right, such a boring ending. The only problem is someone is going to lose someone beloved and someone will not be able to full fill their dreams.

I might sound crazy but death interests me. Don’t get me wrong I am very normal. I feel very normal feelings when people die. I feel like crying when living beings suffer. I too have many dreams I want to pursue not just die because death fascinates me. Anyway, I was saying that death is quite interesting you know. we live for only countable rotation of the earth around the scorching sun but ever thought what happens after death. Don’t you freaking science buffs bombard me with your knowledge that there is no existence of a soul. Well, there are experiments go check for yourself. The soul is very real. Some say free souls are induced in the fetus again. I would say that is very much of a curse as well as a blessing to not remember the memory of the past flesh life circle of a soul. A curse because we are also cursed with ever-present curiosity and blessing because every life has emotions which can be quite burdensome while moving ahead with new life. I would say we have not quite evolved ourselves with the life where we remember the past. And remembering past never happened so it might lead to chaos. You see we always adapt. Perks folks.

But I imagine if I will ever know the mysteries of the cosmos when I am dead? Am I just having fun down here? Am I just a real cosmos actor acting out an unpredictable script which is life, for the entertainment of higher beings just like Shakespeare said once. I imagine if my grandparents are watching us if they are still emotionally active. I wonder the space where I enter another realm or technically dimension. I watched those stories where a person narrates the out-of-body experience. I wonder what is the tunnel for and what does that light leads to?  Do I go to another planet where flesh and bones are not allowed? Or do I really get to see the divine power the religious scripts so preach about? I have so many questions that are unanswered just like others.

This is my curiosity speaking. Only this time the answers can be fetched only if ….. and I am pretty sure there are crazy curious people who would have went with it if not bounded by pain and suffering when leaving a body. But that is not all of my curiosity. I am always curious about the answer. This is quite engaging, the curiosity. And trust me those hordes of late-night documentaries doesn’t help only adds fuel to my curiosity. If you notice properly no one is trying to develop or be great or invent or just live, everyone is curious. You might say no, people are going for the money well, I am telling you they are curious about the life of riches, they are curious for the control and power they will have over others. If you tell me that medicines are created to for us to save our lives I say they are curious how we can defeat the problem, they are curious how we can live more, they are curious how much more we can go, they are curious how the taste of victory, fame and money is and so much more. And the curiosity circle repeats.

fs97sw,TheVirtuist,Building a country based on Philosophical Ideas,"So I found this website called nationstates and I want to make a country based on philosophy. So I have a few questions in order to build a Philosophical Democracy.

1. What kind of ideology should this country be? Should it be Anarchy, Libertarianism, Capitalist, Liberal, Centrist, Conservatism, Socialism, Authoritarianism, or Tyranny?

The rest of these questions have options of Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, and Strongly Agree

1. A country should be judged by how it treats its worst-off citizens
2. Corporations are good for society
3. Marijuana should be legal
4. The world needs to discover its spirituality
5. Young people should perform a year long military servive
6. Without democracy, a country has nothing
7. Capitalism is on the way out
8. It's better to deter criminals rather than rehabilitate them.

fs631m,njsh20,Question: How do you react when you’re asked to go against your morals and/or act unethically at work or school?,"Really struggling with an ethical dilemma at work.  TL;DR at bottom.

I am a special education teacher.  With the end of the quarter, we look at the data we took over the quarter and write reports on each goal addressed in the IEP.  If we addressed that goal, we can indicate if the student is making progress, is not making progress, or met the goal.

My coworker is my mentor.  They are very abrasive, negative, and have a large superiority complex.  I’ve managed fine with this though.  They tell me “data is black and white” and to stick by data.  Sticking to my data, I see a student met a goal, so I indicated appropriately in the IEP.  They then texted me and said “I do not believe this student is meeting this goal.”  They asked me to change my data and ignore the student’s good data days and change the document to say that the student has not met the goal so that the parents see growth.  They told me I should NOT look at all data days.  As a big math nerd, I carefully record data, and I want to incorporate and analyze all data I took. 

How would you handle this?  Is there an ethical dilemma here?  If in a conversation, I would say that this student does not consistently meet this goal in all areas, but the wording of the goal says the student is to so “across 3 data days.”  According to my data, the student meets the goal across 13 data days in the quarter.  Additionally, this is my first year in this position, and this coworker is my mentor.  

TL;DR - my data shows a student met a goal, but my mentor doesn’t think the student has, so I was asked by my mentor to ignore most of the data and lie about progress towards the goal.",3,1585627616,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fs631m/question_how_do_you_react_when_youre_asked_to_go/,philosophy,1
fs5ssx,Brexit-by-April,"Ethics of accessing, possessing and viewing real torture in the internet (and refutation of a common argument)","So this could be an unpopular opinion. It may not be. Who knows? The argument is simple: 

**I. There are no moral nor ethical issues with viewing or accessing torture, beheading, or murder videos on the internet. These things are protected speech and rightfully so. Prohibiting access will do more harm than good.**

**II. It CANNOT be morally compared to accessing or possessing child sexual abuse material or ""Child Pornography"".**

In the United States, there are no laws governing the consumption and viewing of real non-sexual torture videos. We have laws against importation across state lines when it comes to the accessing of real sexual torture video which is very likely prohibited under Obscenity should they fail the miller test. 

And last and not least, we have laws prohibiting possessing, access with intent to view Child pornography; a very justified law in my view, as children are the most vulnerable members of our society, and accessing child sexual abuse material harms them. There is no such thing as ""Simply Viewing"" child pornography (Child sexual abuse material or CSAM). Viewing the material harms the psychological well being of then minors who were forced to perform in pornography and the harm is lifelong. There is also truth that accessing such material, especially if it involves the purchase of said material encourages child sexual predators to continue their production. 

**A common argument I will refute is one which holds the view that possessing or otherwise access beheading videos or accessing torture videos is that our behavior is just as morally unjustified as those who access child sexual abuse material.** However, this cannot be further from the truth. I will attempt to refute this argument that has been floating around online. Indeed, this argument has sadly materialized into legislation in some jurisdiction. An example is New Zealand, which treats possession of real torture or terrorist propaganda as it treats possession of child sexual abuse material.

1) **Children are a special class to be protected.** It is in my view imperative that we defend the rights of the most vulnerable members of society from the violations of their innocence and person hood. For this reason, any risks that could increase the likelihood of harm must be much more harshly enforced than if that risks happened to an adult. This is the reason why we place so much more protection for them than we do with adults. Because there is a substantial truth in that accessing CSAM contributes to encouraging the evil market of child sexual abuse, there is a strong argument to prohibiting ALL aspects of the market, from Non-Commercial access, to those who produce it.

2) **Journalistic Value in recorded violence, and extreme lack thereof in CSAM.** Legalized distribution of torture videos as well as access to them allows for whistle blowing of human rights abuses, and warnings to others who wish to enter a certain region is unsafe to visit. It is furthermore a reminder of the ugly truths of humanity. In most instances, simply a description of the human rights abuse does not suffice. A number of dead from Vietnam for example has less impact than graphic videos of violence that took place. Indeed, it will be a sad day if torture and murder videos were banned.

Is there any value in seeing a recording of a child being sexually abused? None whatsoever. We do not need to see such horrors before we act to put an end to it. On the flip side, the continued access of such material leads to lifelong harm to the victims of CSAM. 

3) **Non-Sexual Violence is fundamental different from sexual abuse.** We in this country have a long history of restricting certain aspects of sexual content, from depriving minors access to content displaying it, to regulating what is permitted in public. There is NO such history when it comes to viewing violent content. 

4) **Encouragement of the Market of Abuse.**  There is no evidence that viewing torture or murder videos encourages more of such crime. However, there is plenty of evidence that CSAM increases the instances of abuse, from both the number of victims to the instances an individual is victimizes.

&amp;#x200B;

Taken all things together, I hold the view that real torture videos, imagery cannot be morally compared to Child Sexual Abuse Material.  We must be very careful and watchful when governments decide to try to create another category of unprotected speech. The issue of Child Sexual Abuse Material is VERY UNIQUE. It must not be compared to recordings of non-sexual abuses that happens to adults.",1,1585626428,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fs5ssx/ethics_of_accessing_possessing_and_viewing_real/,philosophy,1

* Open discussion about philosophy, e.g. who your favourite philosopher
  is, what you are currently reading

* Philosophical questions. Please note that /r/askphilosophy is a great
  resource for questions and if you are looking for moderated answers we
  suggest you ask there.

frq2vu,Tomguim,Faced with Boredom how do we find meaning? An existential video series in times of confinement.,"During the confinement a lot of people I know have been asking themselves really existential questions about who they are, what they want, and have been facing anxiety and profound boredom. In a way this confinement has been a means for people to confront themselves, ripped out of the activity of their daily lives we are forced into a confrontation with ourselves.

This video series tries to walk us down the path of existentialism through Heidegger to help us finally respond to those questions, Who am I? What do I want? and How do I find meaning?

I hope you'll find this helpful, the series is continuing onwards and if you want to join the calls feel free to message me or comment on the youtube.

I'm just trying to help out some friends and whoever is willing to listen so I'm talking on the fly, as a result sometimes retroactively I see that I made a couple errors, so for the pure Heideggarians out there take it easy on me please :) I am super open to criticism though.

	• What do you think are the most commonly held values, ideas, goals, etc. that you see emerging most often throughout the larger philosophical discourse? 
	• Where is most of this professional-level discourse taking place? Here? In universities? In journals? Where do you think most of the ""work"" of philosophy is being done? 
	• What style of writing is most prominent in professional philosophical discourse? What are the most prominent stylistic conventions?
	• What makes a ""member"" of the professional philosophy most recognizable to another? In what ways are they ""initiated"" into legitimacy for participation in professional discourse?

fql6a7,InC0mplete_,Allocating Medical Resources and Mortality rate,"Due to Covid-19 the question of how to distribute ventilators and other medical resources has been raised in the news. Usually the argument I  hear is the following: Otherwise healthy people should be  prioritized since they are more likely to recover with treatment compared to people who are more vulnerable. But I also heared a different line of argument: Vulnerable people should be prioritized since people who are otherwise healthy are much more likely to recover without the help.

I think neither works, because if saving the most amount of people is the goal you have to look at how the overall mortality rate is effected by distributing scare resources. I come to the conculsion that to minimize it, the group with the greatest decrease of the mortality rate (in absolut terms) should be prioritized.

Here is the argument why (math ahead):

I'm assuming that there is equal amount of vulnerable and non-vulnerable people and that you can treat half of them. (Those assumption aren't necessary for the argument, but they make it easier).

f(x)=x\*a+(0.5-x)\*b+c\*(0.5-x)+d\*x gives the me the average mortality rate. x can be any value between 0 and 0.5 and represents the percent of people being treated that are vulnerable, a = mortality rate for vulnerable people if treated, b = m.r. for vulnerable people if untreated, c = m.r. for otherwise healthy people if treated, d = m.r. for otherwise healthy people if untreated. (If x of vulnerable people get treatment, 0.5-x do not and have a mortality rate of b and there are resources left for 0.5-x, that are being used for non-vulnerable people.)

Since f is a linear function, it has its lowest point either at 0 or at 0.5 (unless its constant). The slope of the line is f'(x)=(a-b-c+d), which means the mortality rate increases with the amount of vulnerable people being treated if a-b&gt;c-d (&lt;=&gt; a-b-c+d&gt;0) and decreases if a-b&lt;c-d ( &lt;=&gt; a-b-c+d&lt;0).

Caveat: As I see it there are two big problems:

1. It simplistic and there are going to be factors that aren't accounted for. If for example recovery times are different between groups, that would have to be considered as well.

2. To apply the conclusion you would have to know the mortality rates of various subgroups (What treatment did they receive and how vulnerable they were) and there might not be enough data to  accurately estimate them.

Addendum:

This argument only looks at mortality rate and complete ignores other ethical relevant criteria.

 I made a couple of assumption, that I mentioned above. If you are interested in a more general function here it is:

k = the percent of people that you are able to treat, v = the percent of people that are vulnerable, m = min{k, v}

f: \[0, m\] -&gt; \[0, 1\], f(x)=x\*a+(v-x)\*b+(k-x)\*c+(1-v-(k-x))\*d",7,1585405727,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fql6a7/allocating_medical_resources_and_mortality_rate/,philosophy,1

fqfytg,VetaT,The Plague of intellect,"This is a short paragraph I wrote for my school's newspaper. I hope I can get some feedback because I am relatively new in philosophy:)

&amp;#x200B;

Intellect, or cognitive capacity, is regarded as one of the most fundamental attributes in a human. To think and reason independently is a crucial aspect of human life, and without it, humans would be susceptible to different forms of manipulation. However, intellect is also a double-edged sword, being both good and bad, except that it becomes increasingly worse as our abilities to reason increases. Intellect allows people to hypothesize different scenarios based on initial observations. The benefits of theorizing are that we can apprehend relationships between observations and possible results, but the consequences are that they are no longer astonishments or uncertainties. For instance, a birthday party no longer becomes a surprise if a person had previously imagined a birthday party on the day of his birthday. Furthermore, hobbies are no longer fun if one thinks of the possible real-life repercussions there are in indulging in ‘pointless’ hobbies. Pursuing the arts have long been regarded by many in academia as ‘useless’ and an ‘ineffective’ use of time. However, the arts, like philosophy or music or visual arts, are not ‘useless,’ they are simply unappreciated and incomprehensible if looked through a prevalent, overused utilitarian lens. Another consequence of intellect is imagining the future. The future does not exist until one imagines it, but humans are inclined to hypothesize possible futures in order to work towards such a future. For example, economists create economic plans in the present to create an effect in the future. Students like me tend to think into the future, such as universities and jobs, and as a result, we tend to work too hard towards it and disregard the present moments. Alas, our minds, existing in the future, shortens our lives, and we regret it the older we become. While it may seem convenient to be intellectual, it is also an incurable disease, and perhaps, the phrase ‘ignorance is bliss’ is truly blissful.",1,1585382612,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fqfytg/the_plague_of_intellect/,philosophy,1

Transcendentalism and reincarnation/meaning of life are ESPECIALLY interesting to me! Does anyone have any recommendations of any books along these lines, or just books that have changed your life/perspectives in general?

fpunji,RRFME,Try to nearly realize Kant's idea of a philosopher's stone,"Herein I try to show, how a brief remark of Immanuel Kant on what would be the Philosopher's Stone might be nearly realized by a routine.

In that lecture, Kant mentioned what he imagined to be  the „philosopher‘s stone/*Stein der Weisen“,*  some substance, that is extremely elusive and extremely valuable,  (because it was imagined able to turn any metal into gold.) He used it  metaphorically for an idea, so I understand him, that is able to ensure,  that human judgement directly leads to action.

First,  step-by-step I try to create a routine to get close to such an idea.  Then I try to show, why it is imagined to often work. Then I try to  show, why a learned routine might usually be as close as it can  currently get, then I give personal experiences, possible objections and  a conclusion.

To add some present  day use: now that the average daily routine often halted, people all  over the world more or less aware ask: What do? This might be one  possible routine to inspire answers of new simplicity, stability and  effectiveness that can be used around the world.

I cite:

""Nobody  can or will ever comprehend, how the comprehending should have a  motivating power; it can admittedly judge; but to give this judgement  power, so that it becomes a motive able to impel the will to performance  of an action - to understand this is the philosophers' stone.""

\[Immanuel Kant, *Vorlesung zur Moral Philosophie*, edited by Werner Stark, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 69\].

…Well, how about a learned routine?

A  routine, which analyzes one's world for most important aspects, so that  a concluded following activity has perceived and real purpose.

Routine: -""What is important? and What can I then do?""

""Important""  seems relative to anyone. To me, ""important"" varies, one is my personal  liberation from all kinds of binding processes, from an itch to world  war, caring for my and my social groups' existences time and again,  since the state of liberation seems to decay. From this perspective, it  seems, that life has to liberate itself repeatedly and eventually is  bound again. Liberation here is the activity and process and it is  temporary and can fail by nature.

\-""Am I liberated enough, and if yes, for how long probably?""...

And also important is doing good, because I want, when I can.

\- ...What good can I do?""

Good can be small and great. I want and should want most. So ""best"".

\-...""What best can I do?""

Best  for one can be bad for another. So best for many, best for all. That is  far off, which seems despairing at first, but over months and years it  seems to give direction to thought, both pacifying and motivating, while  lasting.

\-...""What best for all can I do?""

And because my knowledge and my planning are limited, I can only observe, estimate, conclude and try what seems.

**""Do I seem liberated enough, and if yes, for how long probably? What could I try, that seems best for all?""**

These questions might seem a bit weak. But my experience with them indicates, that they can match Kant's prediction.

Looking at them in search of a, *a*  principle for life, one could argue, that life is supposed to liberate  itself and when liberated enough, to try what seems best for all. This  would lead to good living: acceptable standard for oneself and effort  towards best for all, which, when pursued by many, will tend to improve  conditions for many at a faster pace.

Maybe  it seems to work sometimes, because the healthy mind tends to be  prepared for this, because its dynamic appears to be a longstanding  basic part of the human condition.

Humans,  says science, have evolved to often act in their own and/or their  groups' interests, this because their groups apparently highly depend on  it as they often depend on their groups. That seems to be the case  since apes formed tribes.

As a  consequence, the thinking apparatus appears to have evolved towards  being able to see purpose in this, and it can do so subconsciously.  Culture can add to seeing this. The subconscious is said to see many  ends at once (I guess I better have my subconsciousness make my heart  beat) yet thereby it tends to distract the consciousness towards action,  that is more or less diverging from judgement. Though this is necessary  for beings with requirements, a conscious routine might learn to  moderate and guide this with often good results.

Trying  for indicative results, I personally apply this for several years now.  At the beginning it was a slow process, seconds per month focused on  this routine, hardly inspiring, with breaks of several weeks to months.  With increasingly encouraging results I also increased the pace, now I  reach a few minutes per day, divided over the day and evening. And I am  pretty sure, that the subconsciousness applies this in the background  too. Some of the visible, deemed-good results are the ideas I develop,  to be found in my post record.

One  could object, that „best for all“ seems dauntingly broad and far off.  The response is, that it might usually suffice to „try what seems“, and  over time, one might find value in an aim that persists and might  eventually lead one‘s offspring as well.

Or  one could object, that liberation could as well be pursued full-time,  the response is, that this may be, yet for people who want to do  something else, it tends to be reasonable to accept some „enough“  liberation.

Maybe this is closest  to Kant‘s however short idea of a philosopher's stone, and a better one  at that, tending to improve society with better organized tries for  seemingly best for all, and for better organized liberation of  individuals and groups as described, which both seem to be welcome,  evolving, open ends by nature,

fpsn4w,Fjucur2,Selfishness in humans,"I have been in a dilemma  for the past week. I kinda play a certain game with this girl, its an on-and-off thing, she doesn't  really know what she wants etc. But that's  besides the point.

 This situation got me into thinking about the concept of love. I have been reading about psychological egoism and hedonism, and i came to a certain conclusion - nobody on earth really has anyone more important then themselves. If you think about it, the whole reason why we ""love"" somebody is because they make us feel a certain way. When you help someone cross the street, or you feed a hungry person, you do that because you are going to feel good about it. Even if you endure a certain pain, ultimately  you are doing so because you expect some kind of reward after.

That kinda sucks. 

I made this thought experiment about a mother saving her child from an incoming train. Every sane person will jump in front of a train to save their child. But why? Because death is better than living without your child. Again, its the focus on the mother, not the child. She was ultimately thinking about her own well being.

I am growing kinda depressed because of this worldview. I am not a professional philosopher, im not even studying philosophy, just thinking. Im 20 years old.

I hope that this kind of thinking is caused mostly by my immaturity and wrong conception of reality. I have read other articles that negate this kind of thinking and i can see a lot lf reasons it can be wrong. I would like to create a discussion on this subreddit about this, just to see what other people think.

fps54n,tusharmuhammad,thoughts on a scientific amendment?," 

given the government's failure to recognise COVID-19's scientific reality, should we add a scientific standard to the constitution for dealing with pandemics like this? Or what about justifying a national lockdown(similar to Wuhan, China/Singapore/even California) on a scientific basis so civil liberties can be violated for a certain period of time? Im picturing a scenario where such a lockdown is challenged in the supreme court and a scientific debate entails in the court in order to determine if the president's lockdown decree is necessary or tyrannical.

Benefits:

1. Political parties would have to have scientists in their ranks. And you wouldn't have something like the modern republican party who can't seem to acknowledge any objective, scientific principles
2. anyone with political aspirations will have to recognize the scientific reality of things such as climate change or pandemics.

1 Hegel was famous for his dialectical method. Explain. 

2  How Marx implemented Hegel dialectics on history and society? 

3  “The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas: The class which has the means of production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production.”  Asses this claim. 

4  Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were famous for one book: 

5  ""And unlike previous eras, when individuals developed expertise in various areas and took pride in the products that they produced, the division of labor has reduced their activities to simple, mindless tasks that have no personal meaning and provide no satisfaction. Instead of taking pride in the crops they have grown, the clothes they have fashioned, the furniture they have built, the bread they have baked, they are now reduced to “repulsive” repetitive tasks in crowded, noisy factories, working excessive hours for low wages.""  How Marx named this process? 

6  Capitalism has become an economic system out of control with an appetite for growth that is so rapacious that it is ultimately forced to feed on itself.  Do you agree?

fonvmy,CoordinatedWhole,Anti-abortion (Pro-Life) Argument - the Mother's Duty to Rescue the Fetus,"**THE ARGUMENT**

In a thread in the /r/changemyview subreddit, there is an anti-abortion argument that gives me some pause. I don't have a formal syllogism for it, but I'll lay out the points as follows: 

1. Person X (woman) engages in a voluntary action for personal pleasure. 
2. The voluntary action in question has the risk of endangering an innocent third party Y (the fetus).
3. This is risk assumed unilaterally by X without any kind of consent or even knowledge from the part of Y. 
4. X is aware of this, takes measures to mitigate the risk (birth control, condoms etc), but decides to go through with it anyway hoping that the risk doesn't actualize. 
4. The risk does actualize and Y is created, and subsequently endangered. 

Because X carries moral responsibility for creating and subsequently endangering Y, X therefore has the moral obligation to rescue Y - to sustain it for 9 months regardless of the personal cost to her liberty, bodily autonomy, health etc. At the very least, X does not have the moral right to kill Y in order to escape the burden of having to sustain Y. 

Formulated like this, I find the argument to be quite convincing. It's very difficult to agree with the notion that I should be allowed to engage in pleasurable activities that endanger other people with the comfortable knowledge, that should the risk actualize and cause someone to lay claim to my bodily autonomy for survival, then I can just kill them or at least leave them to die.

What are good substantive critiques against this?  

**HYPOTHETICALS THAT COUNTER AND SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT**

The counter-argument appeals to a car accident hypothetical - every time I get into a car, I assume a fully calculable risk of something going wrong (a tire might blow, some other car might charge into me etc). An accident may occur that ends with a pedestrian either dying or becoming injured to such a degree, that I must sustain their life for an extended period of time. Should that risk actualize, then it seems absurd to suggest that I must be hooked up to the pedestrian for 9 months. I never wanted for the accident to happen, but it happened anyway - just like the mother might not want the pregnancy to occur, and takes all the relevant precautions, but it happens anyway. There is no moral fault here and the driver should be freed from the obligation of sustaining the pedestrian even if it causes the given pedestrian to die. 

This hypothetical seems to be morally intuitive and makes sense. The defenders of the argument however claim that the car accident example is dis-analogous and propose their own hypothetical:

Suppose you have a revolver that has 100 chambers in its cylinder. You load it with one bullet and spin the cylinder. This means that there's now a 1% chance of it going off (echoes condom/birth control failure rate). Now suppose the person goes to the street and plays russian roulette with unknowing bystanders - every time he pulls the trigger, he resets the cylinder, keeping the risk at 1%. He does this, because it gives him an almost orgasmic thrill. Eventually the risk actualizes, the gun goes off and a victim is left mortally injured. 

Is it a sufficient excuse to say that the risk was only 1%, the shooter never wanted that risk to actualize and used a 100 chamber revolver precisely for the purpose of minimizing the risk? The answer seems to be an obvious no. It seems to be quite permissible to either force the shooter to rescue his victim (sustain him until he is out of danger) or to at least criminally punish him.

**QUESTION**

I hope to spark a discussion on what is the morally relevant difference (if any) that separates the car example from the revolver example. Moreover, does the act of having sex better conform to the car hypothetical or the revolver hypothetical.

**RESERVATIONS**

This tackles only the bodily autonomy argument. It is not my purpose to provoke a broader debate on the ethics of abortion. I don't have interest in the question of fetal personhood and retreating to this line of argument seems to be a clear concession that the bodily autonomy argument is an insufficient justification.",118,1585131192,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fonvmy/antiabortion_prolife_argument_the_mothers_duty_to/,philosophy,1

fo19i7,TomerTzurx,"Post Emile, or On Education by Rousseau","Hello, Usually I don't post things such as this, but this book was a hard work, so I think its appropriate I will write about it a little. I read the book in Hebrew, so don't expect the terms to be accurate.

This giant, 800 pages book, of the French 18 century Philosopher, is his take on how to raise a child. In Rousseau eyes, the child should be raised in the most ""natural"" way possible, especially early on, but to be eventually a solid and good member of the society. Rousseau gives a detailed explanation on a lot of crucial parts of raising a child, and emphasis the importance of the teacher in this system. The teacher never leaves the child, he becomes his ""sidekick"" at some point, but only to the child eyes.

Through the book is mostly about raising a child, a lot of the book is also about the state of society in these days, and the disfunction of the political situation in these times. In this book Rousseau gives a the base for his famous and important piece of literature ""The Social Contract"". In Rousseau eyes, for creating a functional society, which everyone are equal in, it is important that all citizen will have their voice heard, but will be willing to pay their share for spinning the wheel.

I didn't expect to read this book so fast. I bought it a week ago at second hand, and when held it felt a weird calling to dive into it, then read it in a week. This book holds a lot of my favourite writing of all time, Rousseau writes in such elegant and attractive manner, and almost every page there is an amazing quote to take (yet, it seems I didn't have one stuck truly in my head). ""Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar"" is a part in book IV the especially shocked me in his sophistication. Still, this book is not flawless; a lot of Rousseau ideas seems over the top, and I have to say that Part V holds an horrible take on women raising. It is understandable why Rousseau holds his low grading opinions on women in these ages, but it makes the reading be a little absurd at time.

As a whole, I think Emile is one of the most interesting books I've ever read, and there is a lot to take from this book, not only on child raising, but also about: love, society, nature of humankind, knowledge, compassion. What do you think about my take on the book? What is your take on it? I would love to hear from more people who read the book from top to bottom (as it seems there are not many of them). If someone is interested, I will love to chat with them some more.

My knowledge of the English language is not as developed as I would like it to be to be able to translate my thoughts into words, however I will do my best.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that it is safe to say that people have come to realize that perfection can never truly be achieved, because that is simply human nature. To be human is to be imperfect.

Instead, perfection has become a goal. Although I suppose that it always has. Even though we know that perfection is impossible, we still strive for it. Because it gives us purpose. And hope. Hope for beauty.

Perfection can probably be rooted back to a simple definition( in most cases at least). Beauty. Really what people are after is beauty, because man can not seem to stand the mere sight of ugliness. So we fool ourselves. Even though the ugly may be the truth, we lie to ourselves. We cover up the ugliness in pretty wrapping to make it seem just a little better. It may not be beautiful, but it is certainly better than the horror it was.

But of those who do not care for the beauty but for the truth, the ones who decide that the truth is beauty? Well, it seems to be lost. And we are constantly losing more and more everyday, time and time again we have lied and covered up what is arduous.

fnhgqo,MatthewWoolsey,Importance of Choosing Who You Care About,"Your current reality is predominantly the result of your OWN decisions and actions. 

Whatever you did yesterday brought you to today. 

I say ""predominantly"" because the remainder of what dictates your current reality is the result of the  decisions and actions of OTHERS.

And not just ""any"" other person, the people to whom you give the most access - the people you CHOOSE to love. Your close friends, your girlfriend, boyfriend or spouse. 

These people have almost as much control over your mental well-being, emotional well-being and overall ""reality"", as you do.

When you consider the fact that CHOOSING to care for someone - or choosing to continue to care for someone - is tantamount to handing them your FUTURE and saying ""do with it what you wish"", then you start to appreciate the true importance of that decision.

Today's reality is formed by your decisions, and the decisions of those you've decided to trust your heart with, yesterday - you can't change it. It's come, it's gone. 

But, you can strive for a better tomorrow by choosing to only give your heart to those you trust to look out for it. 

And, if they stop looking out for your heart - or you stop believing they are capable of it - then, you should stop looking out for theirs. You should move on and choose a DIFFERENT person to call friend or lover.

One that is more worthy of your trust. One that is more likely to make tomorrow's reality BETTER, not worse.",1,1584957721,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fnhgqo/importance_of_choosing_who_you_care_about/,philosophy,1

fnd9yr,Kamekamon,Sky of our ancestors,"Hey everyone. Hope you're all safe.

I had a thought about light pollution and the concept of higher understanding through the beauty we see when we look up at the sky.  We seem to crave beauty naturally as a species. I would even go so far as to say we make a lot of our decisions in the pursuit of a higher understanding through beauty, and we don't realize we are doing it. 

I do not mean this in a shallow sense.

The view of the cosmos is the original masterpiece. All meaning and understanding stems from this masterpiece.

Only a few of us get to experience this masterpiece in our lifetime, and I think this is fundamentally wrong for humanity in so many ways. 

I have been looking at religious paintings, stories and other images trying to understand meaning within them from the standpoint of our ancient ancestors. 
The connection these people had with our cosmos must have given them a massive amount of hope which added to their faith. They must have been able to share a sense of community under the greatest masterpiece ever made. Something we all connected with regardless of gender, race and social status.

No one looks into the heavens and says ""man that's really ugly.""
Its really the only thing we agree on as a species. The beauty of the cosmos. 

I see the flames of hell as a form of light pollution, blinding you from the heavens above and your connection with a higher understanding. Without higher understanding we live in mental hell.

I also believe that we seek beauty through escapism within video games, television, movies, books, the internet, art and most importantly psychedelics as an attempt to recreate the euphoric feeling the heavens provide us. 

I believe that by blocking our view of the cosmos, we have hindered ourselves as a species in a deep philosophical way, and this has hurt us over time. 

I wanted to know if anyone has tried to recreate the night sky as our ancestors would have witnessed it. And if so, do you have images I could look at? Even a computer generated version will do. Maybe you could point me in the right direction?

Not all lives are equal, the more happiness one will bring, the more worth that life is. The more intelligent the creature that experiences this happiness the more it weighs.


This means that the life thats most worth saving, is one that in the future will bring most happiness/reduce most suffering (Alexander Fleming, before he invented his vaccine is a good example). One could also bring happiness to oneself, this means that a happy life is more worth saving, than a sad/suffering life. The lives that are worth the least are the one's that will bring suffering to the most people (Hitler before he reached power in Germany is a good example). Lives of suffering and even more lives that will bring suffering to others are of negative worth, so that they should be killed.
The intelligent part means that human happiness are worth (much) more than animals, and even that smart humans happiness are worth more than dumb humans.",1,1584871489,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fmxlyt/my_first_philosophy_not_all_lives_are_equal/,philosophy,1

fmu8hp,MTthoughts782,Desperate Philosophy,"With the idea that any and every possibility plays out simultaneously and indefinitely, our existence can be explained. Consciousness had to exist in a dormant state in an unobservable universe without limits until a specific set of laws inevitably played out causing the first observable matter, light. When the perfect set of laws of the behaviour of energy finally and inevitably played out their turn in the ever changing universe, they caused an anomaly that condensed the unobservable matter into a new form of collective energy. As soon as the observable universe was created the conscious energies began the journey to self awareness. As any and all possibilities where simultaneously playing out, many where short lived and light was created and quickly burned out, although the unfathomable amount of time between the events of creation of light and more and more instances of the phenomenon taking place at once where unobservable to to the observer, therefore creating a seamless path that appeared to create a linear chain of the progressed state of events as they played out as if they where happening in an amount of time less than a fraction of the indescribable amount of possibilities being sifted through to continue it. These chains of events where only observed when they eventually created a new and progressed state of change causing the perception of continuous linear progress. Conscious observation of this phenomenon however, should not be confused with an understanding or awareness of the significance of what’s being observed. Observing states of change is the fundamental element of consciousness, whereas the evolved state of consciousness we often refer to as the typical description of consciousness that we as humans experience since as far as our memories can assure us that we have independently existed, is the element of self awareness. Being self aware can be broken down to the ability to question our surroundings, adding contemplation to the observations being made. Consciousness cannot be simply explained as a collection of micro organisms working in collaboration to form more complex beings, because it is evident that these easily explainable phenomena can only be attributed to hosting it as a medium or vessel of sorts that may only exist in this way as a drawn out elaboration inherited as an instinctual comfort to accept the unexplainable reality. The reasoning for this is because the unanswerable questions being posed for aeons can be avoided and leave capacity for more progressive means of contemplation. There needn’t be any possible definitive or even satisfactory explanation for anything, but a never ending search is the driving force behind cognitive expansion. We as a species undeniably are progressing exponentially, but no clear reasoning is behind the possibly futile attempt to further our understanding of why we are here to ask these questions. A finite and measurable existence in my opinion may, although the most dreaded and inescapable struggle with existence as we know it, also be a fabricated construct to accelerate progressive contemplation. When it is considered, existing indefinitely is a much larger problem to overcome than being presented a finite and certain measurable limit to existence as we know it. Begin to imagine how to occupy this infinite existence, and even more disturbing, if you where truly alone in the universe in experiencing it. The fabrication of the world we know begins to make sense although there is the overwhelming realization that the lack of purpose is understood  rather than explained, and most certainly, never will be.",1,1584852520,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fmu8hp/desperate_philosophy/,philosophy,1

fmpy3z,Flottvest,"[Question/debate] An ideology that ""immune"" to misuse","What I mean by misuse is for example collectivism ending in communism or any of the anarcho- ideologies ending in someone taking control and making a monarchy or the like. The ""immune"" bit in the title does not include invasions or revolutions. What I mean is that the ideology is highly resistant to ideological evolution.

I've been thinking lately of what I believe ideologically. I've swayed quite a bit, even between ""opposites"" like collectivism/socialism and capitalism. I'm currently leaning more to anarcho-syndicalism, but sometimes I want a capitalistic element in there due to egoistic reasons (which I think is a very human thing to think). Morally I've always been existentialist, and I think that is why I always doubt the strength of any ideology to really last. What I see here at home is that there is a type of oligarchy forming out the democratically elected. It is always the same elite that seems to strive for power, and they also seem to think that we serve them and not the opposite as it should be in a democracy. Sort of a post-democratic oligarchy.

I'm curious as to what this community thinks. Do you think that an ideology resistant to change exists?

So by the time say gospels or God's teachings gets to us perhaps we are all hearing objective truths, but it automatically becomes a subjective experience once interpreted. 
something to support this is that there are many denominations in the Christian church particularly meaning that there are disagreements on how scripture is interpreted.  but once again, if that's the case how do we ever get to God's  objectivity. 
and if things are objective then should we not all agree on the same perspective of something. Especially when it's from God?",1,1584798086,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fmf4nr/if_gods_word_is_objective_then_how_we_interpret/,philosophy,1

flu12i,sketchymidget,"Thoughts on ""The birth of tragedy"" by Nietzsche"," In order to properly tackle the main question that this book raises for me, I must first make clear what I mean (and I assume Nietzsche means as well) by ”illusion”. I also need to briefly go into non-dualism and establish man as god, explaining my understanding of why we fail to understand our true nature. After this I can go into where I’m missing a puzzle piece that stops me following Nietzsche’s narrative. Here is my brief explanation:

 We are all artists, illusionists and creators. This is evident in the great lengths we have to go to in order to dispel the illusion we are creating for ourselves. The term ”enlightenment” refers to understanding your true nature. This is because we are such skilled illusionists that we have fooled ourselves into thinking we aren’t making up any illusions at all. We name and categorise and make up with such creativity that we create a whole other world, one that we then choose to live in. Within this world, we create concepts such as time, that we then proceed to forget are made up, and lose ourselves in. These concepts become so ingrained into our lives in the illusion that we can only step outside of them for brief instants before being dragged back in. We both lose and gain our omnipotence through this illusion.

I’ll elaborate on this. The true nature I refer to is the non-dualistic view of the world (Brahman in Hinduism), stating that by virtue of existence being the only certainty, we are all part of the same whole, borderless, all-powerful, god. This is where the necessity for illusion originates. An all-powerful, omnipotent being cannot be borderless and omnipotent if there are no borders. This is man’s significance to man. If there existed only a single human, with no knowledge about others like it, the human would not classify itself as human, but would instead be a part of the universe. This human would, by virtue of being part of the universe, be all-powerful and all-knowing, because he isn’t limited to being a human, and is simply a part of existence, thus living his true nature. If this all-powerful and all-knowing human met another like it, it would identify and name the other figure as a human, and the illusion would begin. This would at once create both a feeling of ecstatic happiness and tragic sorrow. The human would, by classifying itself as human, have limited itself to a human form, being separated from it’s true nature. At the same time, the human would feel ecstatic happiness and fulfillment, because the creation of limitations would make it realise that it was indeed borderless and limitless. From this explanation i can continue. 

 The missing puzzle piece for me is the necessity for a limitless being to create limits for itself. Nietzsche argues that the true nature of existence is suffering, calling it ”The primal suffering” or ”The primal oneness”. The whole rest of his book rests on this, going on to say that art and illusions are the way in which existence deals with itself. This to me, is a rather cynical view of existence, eternal suffering dealing with itself through illusions. My understanding is that ”The primal oneness” as Nietzsche calls it, is not eternal suffering but eternal peace. I come to this conclusion because suffering can only exist when contrasted against something else, thus making it impossible for the non-dualistic nature of existence to be suffering. This makes me fail to understand Nietzsche’s core argument of why a borderless being would create borders for itself, and undermines his whole chain of thinking for me.",1,1584706480,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/flu12i/thoughts_on_the_birth_of_tragedy_by_nietzsche/,philosophy,1

fl71cj,Vercidax,Optimology Exists in Philosophy,"The first question every logical person should be having right now is.
What is “Optimology?”
To answer that, think about it like this.
It is the space in which two states of time exist.

For those of you who realize what I’m talking about, yes.
Optimology technically answers Nichetze’s question of “What the meaning to life?”
However, it’s not very simple. Hence why it took me 22 years of deducing to come up with both the -ology of the field and also it meant I would have to answer current society's biggest question of.

“What does it mean to exist?”

Now, to speak bluntly. To be an Optimologist currently, you have to be absurdly creative.
Not because it’s a difficult concept, but because everybody has the wrong perspective of time.

You’ve heard the thought statement of
“Which came first, the chicken or the egg?”

This by technicality is an oxymoron. And, I can prove it.

Think about the word “Create” 
How does that word exactly fit in how you perceive the world?

I’ll just be honest and it may hurt a lot of feelings but hey, science doesn’t care about feelings. That word doesn’t have to exist.
It’s vastly convenient that the word exists for you, however, if anybody ever tells you the word “create” has to exist. They’re technically talking about fantasy as it stands right now.

Now you may say that “But that’s not how companies operate” or even “But God is the one who created us” and although that may be a real statement, that’s only because you don’t understand how you break down your statements.

Answer me this.

“Are companies created?”
If you answered yes, then that’s already breaking logical thinking.

Right logical. What do I mean by that? Allow me to answer. 
It is when two points meet a consequential need.

Example:
1 +1 MUST = 2
The two 1’s being used as the two points and the “must equal 2” being the consequence of that statement being true.

That equation is 100% logical under my description of logic I just stated. However, just as I was criticizing companies with that same logical statement. It still falls under the same flaw of which all those words were “created.”

Damn, maybe then Optimology doesn’t exist, right? How can you make that statement and still claim this level of logic can exist

Well, that’s the thing, what I'm saying is. 
When you think of something and your mind can create it. You’re technically bending reality backwards to think of a time where it could be true.

But the issue is. If you think of a time before reality can exist then that would mean you’re talking about the opposite thing of reality. Meaning you’re talking about fantasy.

Yes, religion by this definition is a fantasy thought. It may be real and people may live it out every day but. It does not mean it exists.

Have you ever said “Oh my God” or “What the hell?”
Every time you infer to those words which were created over the history of time, then you’re falling into a fantasy thought.

But here’s the thing, that doesn’t mean you can’t use them or you shouldn’t use them. That just means you’re inferring a fantasy thought! 
That’s it, no magic, no trick. You just now understand what you’re saying more comprehensively.

I know this is a vastly abstract thought and most people may not be getting it but.
There is a bright side to all of this. If you ever imagine anything and it’s not been created into reality. You can “by definition” of Optimology. State you’re “Bending Reality”

Pretty cool right? Every time you have an imaginary thought you’re being reality into what people commonly call fiction!

Now for all of you creative people, I'm sure that’s a comforting thought. However, if a psychologist heard what I said their jaws should be dropping.

How can you diagnose someone if they’re constantly bending reality?

I don’t want to answer that question in this post, but I want to use that as a means to say.
Life is really complicated! 

But for those of you more philosophically minded, allow me to graze on Nietzsche question of 
“What’s the meaning of life?”

Oh boy, well.
Let’s put reality into layers from the perspective of Optimologist.

And the top of the layer would be
“Logic” exists.
And coming down it would be
Reality then Space.

Because if there was no space for reality then how could reality exist in our perceived reality?

Notice how that statement means something.

It means something for reality to exist in space.
Because if it didn’t, you technically wouldn't see anything because no space exists for you to see it!

Alright, let me stop you right there, why?
Because I used the word “Means”

Nietzsche said, “What’s the meaning to life?” 
But how can you even possibly answer that without first answering 
“What is the meaning for us to have space and exist in reality?”

Well, that’s just the thing, This infers he failed on a fundamental level of logic here.

Now for you physicists out there, I know. 
“How dare you say he failed on a fundamental level when you never included gravity!”
Because by Einstein's theory of special relativity, gravity bends time.

That’s the thing, time is indeed bent by gravity. However, you’re placing gravity as a consequence of reality and space.

Gravity does not need space to exist. Why? Because the existence of time is the consequence of gravity being bent.

If you can make logical sense of that statement, then you’ll immediately see the flaw of how almost everything you see through your senses (Sight, Smell, Taste, Touch, Feel)

Time is the real consequence of everything you observe.

Because if time didn’t exist, how can you possibly think without assuming of fantasy that the word “create” exists?

Unless you bend time, you absolutely cannot. Therefore by inferring anything before the idea of creation, you break logic.
The real scary part of being an Optimologist is.. You can tell almost in real-time when people are being delusional. 
Because If you have the idea of “This word was created” as a fact of your reality, you’re being delusional by inferring to a fantasy you created in your mind.

Now all of this abstract thought is nice and all and unless you’ve trained your mind to make absolute logical thoughts this concept isn't easy. To that effect, I wanna go into more detail as to why I used “Opti” 
It’s referring to the “Optimal point in time in which to think about a thought” 
So in a way to be an Optimologist is to recognize at which point the idea of “Optimal Logic” breaks.

There’s a lot more I could say, however, allow me to end it here.

I’ll post a link for all of you visual learners out there to see what I’m talking about. It should be of great help for those who just have no idea what I'm talking about or just want a visual representation of how to see the world as an Optimologist!",2,1584608999,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fl71cj/optimology_exists_in_philosophy/,philosophy,1

fk5koq,h-i-k-a-r-i,My answer to Mary's room.,"The Mary's room is a philosophical thought experiment by Frank Jackson.



Mary had not seen any color as she surrounded herself with black and white everything from birth. She is a neurologist and is an expert in color visions and knows about it's physics and biology. And she exposes herself to color one day, does she learn anything new, despite learning about it all her life? 

My answer is of course, she does! Let's compare her to a person who has total color blindess, say for example, Todd here who had this illness since he was a baby. You explain colors to him, how red is hot, orange is warm, etc., and how our eyes process colors and whatnot. Now, despite that, Todd doesn't still understand because he didn't experience nor see it. Mary is the same with Todd, despite knowing all those stuff, she will still learn something new by seeing color. Todd receives a EnChroma glasses and now he can see some color, now he understands what you meant when you explained all that stuff to him. 


TLDR; Mary does experience something new.

fk4ilo,DeeDubb83,The lack of graphic imagery is prevented us from treating COVID-19 with the gravity that it deserved.,"Front line photographers give us an important view of what war, famine, and disease looks like. Imagine 9/11. What imagery pops into your head? The explosion of the second plane hitting? The towers crumbling? The first responders covered in dust? This visceral imagery immediately reminds us of the gravity of the situation, and the importance of front line photographers. 

Even with diseases, such as smallpox or ebola, there are images that immediately fill our minds. These images become the mascots of the problem.

So what is the mascot associated with COVID-19? Especially in the beginning? It was mostly people in masks or biohazard gear, along with the same [microscopic image](https://portcitydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/COVID19.jpg) that is attached with every article, likely due to a lack of anything more compelling.

Our cultures have become accustomed to shocking news to the point where that has become normalized. The lack of shocking images led us to underestimate the power of this virus until it was at our doorsteps. 

Even now, the images that are associated with COVID-19 are only tangentially connected. People quarantined at home, grocery store shelves emptied, and empty streets are becoming our new association with the virus.

What is the solution? There really isn't one. The virus isn't sexy or shocking. For most people, the symptoms are mild enough, and the cases where it is severe are not photographed as they are within the confines of hospitals. Fortunately, it seems that the numbers and the science have been compelling enough for the majority of people to follow instructions. However, there is a very vocal minority that remains, continuing to underestimate the virus and ignore the gravity of the situation. Hopefully they do not cause unnecessary deaths.",1,1584448657,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fk4ilo/the_lack_of_graphic_imagery_is_prevented_us_from/,philosophy,1

The way any future outcomes after the “now” play out are based on the outcomes of the “past” which goes all the way back to the creation of the universe. With that being said everything that has happened and will happen would always happen that way because of the way the universe is at any given time (Including life as part of the whole universe). If I were to get to the end of my life and then somehow everything was rewinded back to when I was a baby with everything exactly how it was the first time I existed, everything would play out exactly the same. On a bigger scale go back to the identical beginning of the universe and simulate to now I would still be writing this post the exact way I am.

fik04y,KasaiHachani,Our attitude towards the virus,"First, to give context I live in an Arabic country in northern Africa called Tunisia which was affected by the virus outbreak in Italy for its heavy trades and immigration towards it. Many immigrants returned home and we're having an outbreak of our own which according to what's happening will become severe in a couple of days.
After the virus became a conscious threat to the general public, and given that Tunisia is an Islamic country, people started to heavily critique any and all religious activity and how people donated to build places of prayer more than donating to hospitals. Which is objectively bad but the religious critique stemming from that is much popularized by the new atheists although they're not showing that so publicly for its sinful nature in our society. This seems to be a pressing effort to make people throw their believes out of the window and see reality for what it is.
That's not necessarily bad until you consider the alternative given to the general public: your life is meaningless and you are cancerous to the well being of the world. Which is - if not apparent enough - just a call to demise.
And I've seen way more than usual posts that are not specifically related to my community about this being ""a defense mechanism for earth to deal with humans"". That seems to me a satanic belief if it's thoroughly integrated by people because it will make the only correct mode of being putting a halt to human existence therefore being murderous and with terroristic tendencies.

Seeking an Appropriate Venue for Some Fruitful Discussions in Fundamental Physics 



Good morning colleagues




I would enjoy engaging some like-minded folks for a discussion that is I believe of relevance to physics especially relating to obstacles to deeper understanding of modern physics and cosmology.





Should you participate, all of course, willingly - you may get the same interesting insights  - some of which also reflect on concepts such as the meaning of time and even free will.  Keep in mind research such as by John Conway, now alas retired, on how math/physics/philosophy can so intersect.




My challenge is not the math and physics or even philosophy; rather is in understanding where such a discussion can meaningfully take place and so this initial contact.  The discussion is thus Arrived.  To date, I seemed to make errors - posts deleted by mods as is absolutely their right as this is their world and not mine. 




So, I am quite open to all such feedback on how and where for these interesting discussions.  Now, what I am not interested in: egos, bravado, name calling - or any such things.  This intended a spockian world of exploration in logic accompanied by pleasing poetry of thoughts, query and collaboration on ideas.  Helping another, genially.  Fun, games and jokes all aid the conversion, but only if intended non hurtful.  I do not know where such is possible as I don't dive in these waters much other than for the fapping for which this seems marvelous indeed.




Mods: Please, I look forward to your feedback as well, but please as well simply understand: I am serious in this request and thus please direct any constructive conversation to where best initiated on even the fundamental question of where such can occur.  Most importantly, if such is not possible at all here, that information is useful to me, so please, I look forward to any feedback. As such, should you simply delete, my understanding of the void of where such reasoned and constructive conversation cannot occur grows. 





My thanks to all for considering.

PS I give below some suggestions on skills that will aid any discussions, not a priori necessary (tho familiarity with these, will ease):





Poetry, simply because 


Baysian logic/choice 


Comfort with contemplation on infinity 


Basic geometric manipulation, limited to d=3 


Simple modular math concepts


Contemplation of concepts in free will/choice


Knowledge on the outstanding physics and cosmological observations/big Qs


Intuitive comfort in Maxwell's fields


Most useful: intuitive understanding of thermodynamics especially M's demon and such 


Finally, as teaser for the biology nerds, like i: as much neurology as you can (but that, a bit separate topic - part II) 


(And finally, as quite the teaser: the view on the way includes that, I believe, in the distance, on the profile of Mt #137;) 





A rather esoteric list, but the more you have, the better as I have traveled the path and know the hurdles and thus have insight I happily share when and as time allows. 




PPS I see one can get messages - please, I request, limit any on simply where to openly start as we cannot the discussion itself in such venue have, for reasons obvious, are they not?",1,1584197387,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fijh7d/seeking_an_appropriate_venue_for_some_fruitful/,philosophy,1
fijffu,null_blog,Night of the Living Dead as a Nietzschean Metaphor on Fascism,"Although Carpenter himself described his horror masterpiece as a critique on the American society of the Vietnam war era. I can't stop thinking it as a metaphor on fascism based on the implications of the concept of  passive nihilism, as the main drive of zombies is not the destruction of what exists and it's replacement with something new (active nihilism) but the destruction of all evolution and locking the existent in a permanent state (passive nihilism).

fhyujv,NameRofl,Any and Every Living Being is Selfish One Way or Another,"When people perform selfless acts, it is simply their heart telling them to do it in order to gain recognition or create useful ties. This would unintentionally bring benefit to themself. Everyone forms relationships only because they can benefit from their so called ""friends and family"", no one is truly selfless. Same thing goes to animals, for example, plover birds feed on food left in a crocodiles mouth while the crocodile lets the bird eat because it keeps their teeth clean. They form a relationship, however, they are only doing it for their own individual gain, even if they can't tell whether it is selfish or not. Same thing goes with humans, even if they don't realise it, everyone does something to get something in return both intentionally and unintentionally. Humans form packs just like wolves and discriminate people like robbers or murderers because they just don't like it or they don't benefit the pack. If I were to tell others that it would be better off if everyone was just dead, theres going to be someone who would say ""Why not you do it die to set an example"". And whoever says that, they would just support this point. Humans naturally curse at those they don't like, they banish and throw shame on them as they believe that there is benefit in their absence. Meanwhile, when people tell others ""Your so kind/You're so smart"", they are simply doing it so that they would gain favor of this person. Living beings are all selfish one way or another. Only objects are truly selfless. The sky, the sun, the mountains, they don't do things for their own benefit or to discriminate others. Only these, non-living things, can truly be selfless because of the way time, space and logic works. I'm only somewhat confident in this belief of mine so I'd like to get some feedback and opinions on this matter.",1,1584102376,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fhyujv/any_and_every_living_being_is_selfish_one_way_or/,philosophy,1
fhyjyf,Djoko1453,"Western society is fueled to display a false sense of altruism when in reality they project narcissism, greed, and self centered pride in the actions they commit to. (In the modern era and throughout history)","Look I know people are gonna downvote this post and so be it, but l’m compelled to speak what I think is right and voice my opinion. To preface I am criticizing myself as well because I myself am from the United States.
For a long time I’ve noticed a pattern among people of western descent: American, French, British, German, Canadian, Dutch, Belgian, etc. All of which have had a sense to “help” the underprivileged (in terms of civil, religious, physical, and economic rights) in ways that are only seen by the public through mass media coverage that is skewed to make them seem like great altruists. For example, during the Rwandan genocide, the media covered the UN’s “genuine” support to peacefully combat the conflict at hand. As we all know the UN and western powers didn’t do anything true to stop it from happening and this fake sense of pity through mass coverage of westerners “calming” the situation was only a sham to make it seem like everything was ok. This is only one of many situations on large scales such as the Rwandan Genocide that show the disingenuous motives western powers and society have. What makes this worse is that we are more privileged than others which makes us feel like the ambivalent watchers of peace and order in the world. But in reality we have malicious motives that use the underprivileged as pawns of greed and materialism. This is not something that is new either, it’s been here historically present through colonialism, the World Wars, the Cold War, and up into the Modern era to name a few. A modern example today is with the coronavirus, we are more interested in the naive westerners who chose to travel when it wasn’t advised as oppose to taking interest into the plight of the innocent people of Wuhan who are suffering from this epidemic as their government turns a blind eye (And yes there are organizations like UHO, Red-cross,etc. that are perfectly capable of reaching Wuhan and help contain the contamination). We use the plight of others to better our own image and make us seem like the victors and heroes of the narrative. In reality we only fuel our narcissism of being the “greatest”. But in truth, the victors and leaders write history to fit their own agenda. Countries such as the US, UK, France, Germany, etc. have done this time and time again shaping themselves to look as though they care about the well being of other demographics and countries when in reality they use them for their undisclosed benefit. If we truly believe we are the benevolent force of good that is here to keep world order than we should be looking out for the well being of all and actually take initiative instead of acting like we do and then twiddling our thumbs when it comes ti for action.",1,1584100954,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fhyjyf/western_society_is_fueled_to_display_a_false/,philosophy,1

fgtkm5,Kameha-Game,I don’t know what to do anymore.,"I am agnostic and I believe in all possibilities. Although I hold this, I hate hearing these forceful ideologies being pushed (not directly towards me) and those claiming to know so much about this universe. 

Even though I know that we know nothing about this reality and far beyond it and us humans should be humbled at the infinite plane we have been born into, I don’t know what to think, I don’t know what to do and I don’t even know if I truly exist or if I’m in a false sense of awareness created by my minds faculties.

I don’t know if God exist, I don’t know if God doesn’t exist, I don’t know if life has or lacks objective meaning, I don’t know if life is just some practical joke and I’m just a mass of cells stationary on a bigger mass of solid matter floating through empty space. I don’t know if spirits exist and I don’t know if life continues after this one.

I want guidance but I don’t know who to trust. If I ask a theist, they might just say “god has a plan for you, you just need to seek him, you will see him eventually”. If I ask an atheist, they might just say “everything has a natural cause and is not the result of an ‘imaginary friend’ or ‘fairytales’”. If I ask a nihilist/absurdist, they might say “your just a speck in a universe that doesn’t care, get over it and just live”. If I ask a spiritualist, they might say “if you seek, you will find your place in the universe”.

I don’t know what to say, do, or think. I don’t even know if I’m “doing” anything. I want something but don’t know what that thing is, rather if that thing is a human construct like logic, rationality or science based, or if it’s something more personal.

fgc5sq,Grace_of_Reckoning,We as Greater Organisms...,"Problem being addressed: Classic idea of humanity's pursuits of advancement potentially misguiding their fundamental quality of life (wellness)

Thesis: Humanity's advancements have presented complications into the life of the individual which result in a kind of dissonance between the the conscious intent of the individual themselves and the ""Original Intentions"" of nature; nature wishes to urge us, as greater (more complex) organisms, to pursue a closer relationship with purity and essentiality by posing us with the challenge of solving our own complications so to better harmonize with the grander natural order more integrally and with finer intricacy

Possible objections: Nature cannot be a set definition. All is natural &amp; nothing can truly be unnatural, at least technically, being that all has come from natural organic development. 
To define something as ""overcomplicated"" is highly dependent on the conscious observer, and so may not be a reliable aspect to the argument of, ""Humanity is overcomplicated and so must pursue balance by promoting themes of unity and simplicity""

I have read before how most lower lifeforms (minimal/crude anatomy respectively) may have a circulatory system which may be described as ""open circuit"". This refers to the matter of their blood circulation NOT being regulated by a heart-like organ muscle. Instead, they may have a much simpler blood chamber which is more like an intersection of main arteries that allow for greater blood flow when passing through the section. In certain cases, often with crudely structured deep sea creatures, they have relatively nothing at all – just a purely open circulatory system.

The effect I presume this system might have, compared to the complexity of the human system with a multichambered highly variable heart muscle structure, is that there would be a much lesser likelihood of abnormalities within the systems operations. Less variance in pressure, less emotional variance, less capacity to experience from within altogether. Aside from the grade of brain development as surely the primary factor, this is almost like the dualistic meaning of being a lesser lifeforms in essence; if the ""heart"" is lesser, then the creature is lesser, and needless to say vice versa.

So, we humans, the greater lifeforms, with our high capacity for variance here are naturally more prone to becoming involved with 'Chaos'.
We have so much potential to experience a vast array of emotional sensations, which register within our minds, though certainly stem from the conditions of our heart functions (though it's also true that perceiving events and sensations with the senses into the mind can also affect the hearts conditions, thusly feeding back into the mind, like a loop). This luxurious liberty should be taken as both a gift and a curse I feel could be said. As the classic saying goes, ""With great power, great responsibility"", we must work to heighten our composure and further our ability to control our emotions and tame our hearts so to protect them from being swept up into the chaotic rhythms of human life that we may be exposed to. 

It's like our inherent deficit, we complex extravagant lifeforms are very unskilled at being enduringly tame and simple. This, to no coincidence, was indeed the work of the ancient sages. Those who practiced meditation with great austerity and conviction, furthering their composure along and scrutinizing the fine grade of their inner balance.
Think about how natural it is for an infant to lose composure, their unlearned little hearts are so easily disturbed! Now think about a wise old man, perhaps very accomplished and greatly focused on aspects of life he deems significant. This type of educated heart is so well rested and composed. Clearly, given the teachings of sage work, there is a grand direction to observe here. The heart craves composure, to be well rested and finely tuned so to appreciate finer subtlety and to be protected from the harmful erratic sensations.

 Of course, similar to how the body's musculature may be developed to withstand heavy weight and impact force, so may the heart be developed to have greater tolerance of more drastic influences. Though subtlety must be keenly practiced always. Without subtlety, any degree of tolerance to these more drastic inner influences would be merely negligence; like someone placing their hand over a fire without having the capacity to sense that their flesh is being destroyed by the flame.

In conclusion, I feel it must be the given role of humanity to practice this method of being soothingly modest and neutral with their abilities for inner experience. In other words, it would clearly be unwise to involve one's self with such dramatic overstimulating activities merely to cure away boredom! That is, unless you're properly prepared with the correct balance of intricate self control and strong sturdy resilience. Be pure of heart, and rest at ease. Enduring composure has always been the key.",1,1583838702,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fgc5sq/we_as_greater_organisms/,philosophy,1

Why is this? Because in the current world of accepted knowledge we cannot even know the truth of moral theory or principle.

fg9dlx,orangejuiceisbetter,"New to philosophy, starting with Platos writings, is this a good idea?","I have found that philosophy is something i thoroughly enjoy learning about, as I spend most of my days pondering existential questions, among other philosophical ideas of my own (Ideas that have probably been talked about by other philosophers but I haven’t gotten there yet). I’ve never realized how naturally similar to Socrates my approach to life is, and I felt right at home learning about him. Then I learned that most everything we know about Socrates comes from Plato.

Besides youtube videos and internet articles, I haven’t done any real reading, so I went to Barnes and Noble and picked up “Essential Dialouges of Plato” translated by Benjamin Jowett.

After a introduction in the book about ancient Greek city states and the essence of the times Platos lived in, along with some minor background info on Athens and Pre-Socratics, I jumped in and read Ion and Hippias Minor.

I enjoyed them although I will admit these are not exactly easy reads and Socrates can get pretty annoying with his method, although I can appreciate it at times, just kind of redundant at the same time.

Is Plato the best place to start? I have read that it can be difficult for a beginner although I feel like I grasped the majority of what’s going on albeit I had to reread sentences and paragraphs often. As I get deeper will things just fly over my head and should I start with overviews of philosophy in general and secondary sources? Some people seem to act like starting with Plato will just confuse a new comer, but I’ve also read that primary sources are necessary and Plato is a good place to start. What do you think?

ffrw4b,I_like_that_dog,I finally got around to writing out my point of view on how I view the Universe through a lens of math and logic,"Quick elevator pitch:
1. I believe alternate Universes must exist
2. I believe alternate Realities must exist
3. I consider these to be wildly different statements

I think these are undeniable facts when defining a Universe as a four dimensional object (in which I view it as an infinitely large matrix, the columns being moments in time, and the rows being Boolean statements/questions used to describe every aspect of the Universe at a given moment) and a Reality is defined as a set of rules that relate one moment to the next (represented as a function that defines the changes between moments in the Universe)

I also go into, perception of our Universe vs. the Universe from a non-personal point of view, why time is different from the dimensions of space, and our inability to comprehend a Universe that exists in a different Reality.

In fact, as naive as it may seem, I don't believe altruism exists at all. That is, I don't believe people would help and serve others if they weren't rewarded in some form or fashion.

To assuage such concern, it was suggested I focus instead on the outcome instead of the underlying motive. In other words, what does it matter that the good deeds performed are the result of the conscious or unconscious belief of being rewarded? In the end, shouldn't it be the good deed that matters?

What do you think? Do you believe altruism exists? Should the outcome matter more than the motive?

I have no idea on what to write or how to interpret this literary piece of work in the light of a theory of history despite the fact that the short story was adopted from a real historical event.  

Please help me with that how should I connect one with another. 

From reading what is given, i noticed several terms by Koselleck , singularity (singular event) 
(The happening of the singular event is conditioned by the recurrence of the same (I don’t know how to put it, same what?).  Structure of repetition (long-standing structures enable change).   In a word 
, from my understanding on him, the course of history is neither linear or cyclical but a synthesis of both. 

I don’t really understand his theory of historical time. For me, it’s a total word play based on my observance that concrete analogy is mostly applied to explain his point of view instead of reasoning. (Sorry, I don’t understand philosophy)

ff9zbo,TheShihma,Religion is the core foundational structure for multi-familial human societies.,"Religious idea : a construct or statement that cannot be substantiated by reason alone.

In a debate with [Dr Rebecca Goldstein](https://youtu.be/xV4oIqnaxlg?t=5300), Willian Lane Craig points out that Rebecca Goldstein's moral social construct doesn't make any sense, as its entirely based on pure material force. 
She quickly dismisses his rebuttal, rejecting any premise that she could possibly be wrong on this issue. 

This strikes at the heart of an issue which is missing from her argument of a moral framework. What exactly does someone who have authority over you, care at all about you? 

In a family, consisting of brothers, father,mother and sisters, there is the preservation and cultivation of DNA in future generations. 

We see in many animals the structure of coalitions and troops, namely, to reduce attack vectors from predators in their area. Multiple families coming together. Subsisting in a state of tolerance of one another against superior predators. 
However, animals with no real natural predators do not live in multi-familial societies.

Humans, given the unique level of abstraction, are capable of seeing that all the natural orientation is ordered towards the procreative process. 

And they create religion, as a way to elevate above the primal instincts, and essentially create a foundation for a larger and more powerful social group than possible through natural means.",1,1583657315,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ff9zbo/religion_is_the_core_foundational_structure_for/,philosophy,1
ff9b6f,Beardeddude42,Thoughts on the nature of self from the mind of a guy who can't fall asleep,"I would like to write down my thoughts on the nature of my existence. I'm sure my ideas are not unique but I'm not entirety sure what they are classified as or why I'm posting them. I am not a student of philosophy but I think about this a lot. This may be a long post and I thank you if you read it completely. I'm going to start with some basic stuff but I am going somewhere with it.

I cannot even begin to explain why anything exists. I'm not sure the lense of ""why"" even applies to something that may be beyond the concept of time and thus causality. But I feel I can reasonably explain consciousness in the context of the universe if the universe is a given.

Many people believe that there is something we are missing in order to understand consciousness. Some invoke the concept of a soul. Others look for a scientific discovery - a quantifiable difference between things that are conscious and things that are not while still struggling to define consciousness. I think that we already have all the tools we need to understand but are simply blinded by our egos. I think that if we drop the idea that consciousness is unique as a pretense it becomes a lot clearer.

As an engineer of physical machines, electrical circuits and software I am very comfortable viewing things through their lense. I think when many people start to see any argument formed with this backing they usually start to dismiss it because they ""are not a machine"" they are ""something more"". How could a machine ""experience"". But let's suspended disbelief for a minute. If we approach this purely from a standpoint of known facts - not thinking of ourselves as the beings we are studying - we can see that our minds are made of logic gates. We can see that there is a set of electrochemical inputs that can trigger an electrochemical output based on some function defined by the inner structure of a cell. We do not understand how all these logic gates interact to form us. But we have figured out some of the low level computation used. Regardless of the exact design of these circuits we can easily see how they can theoretically be combined to produce some of our abilities. Memory, motion, sensors, logic, and mathematics are all concepts we have no trouble accepting that a machine is capable of. And for the more engineering minded of us we can also easily visualize how emotion can be actualized as a system that simply modifies the before mentioned systems - adjusting many algorithms based on the output of sensory and logic systems. And intuition simply being lower systems communicating information without that information being fully interpreted by higher level systems.

These concepts are well known and common in a lot of science fiction. But there is still ""how dose that explain my ability to experience all of that - what am I"". And in science fiction that consciousness is something that appears when a machine is "" human enough"". But that does not explain experience of self. It just creates machines with it.

I think people get hung up on understanding consciousness because they are able to view it from the inside. From the outside we would define consciousness as ""self awareness"","" the ability to choose"",""perception"". What does a system need to do these things? In a basic example a flip-flop circuit has memory and one that has its input and output tied together has the ability to read itself. It by definition is aware of its own state. Its world is only 2 possibilities and it **experiences them by becoming them. **

When we look at living brains as people think we can see that many of the same groups of neurons ( logic gates ) are activated when people are experiencing something as when they imagine experiencing the same  thing. Not every gate is used for both states and there are some that are used for just one state or the other but there is a large amount of overlap. And from the subjective standpoint we can say that imagining something is like a mild version of experiencing it. Its not exactly the same but there is overlap. For those of us who are visually oriented and have a well defined ability to visualize we can take the example of seeing a object and then imagining it. Both times we experience seeing it. For those who do not visualize well there are other senses you can use here to produce similarly impactfull experiences with. In both states the part of our mind that represents vision takes on that pattern or shape - that configuration of activated  logic gates.

The nature of information is that what it represents depends on context. And context is itself information. Any system, no matter its form or material, is an expression of information. A single circuit may only have a world of 2 possibilities but when the same circuit's state is interpreted in the context of an adjoining circuit of 2 states there are now 4 representations (And that's just for binary circuits. Other bases can grow by greater powers). In the same way a group of neurons representing an image are given context by adjoining neural circuits. 

I put forward that experience and existence are the same thing. Consciousness is ""experience of self"". The fact that a circuit is able to read its own state is enough to explain its perception of its own state. There is no extra anything needed to explain it. And if existence is an innate property of the universe then so is experience.

If this is true it has some pretty strong implications. One being that any system or set of systems that has a feedback loop is self aware to the degree and shape/nature of the information in that feedback loop. And because the universe is full of feedback loops at almost every level we can say that to a large degree consciousness is a innate property of the universe. 

We can see in the structure of the brain that it is almost all loops. So we can say that the brain attempts to maximize consciousness within a domain by increasing the context of information (the interaction of structured information).

I would also like to take one last moment to poke a hole in the idea of continuous self. I think that what we perceive as self is just an idea of a continuous being. But in order to create our perception you really only need 3 general concepts. Memory, sensory input (internal and external) and algorithms. Imagine a machine that has a record of memory and takes in sensory input and then its algorithms make outputs based on its memories and inputs. Then break down this machines actions to instantaneous moments (think calculus) on a timeline. Take one of these moments. The machine has a concept of self and a concept of its history (its memory), the experience of interacting in an environment (its sensory inputs) and the power to make a decision (its algorithms). Now move to the next moment. Its the same. At each moment the machine has everything needed to experience our existence. As long as memory and the algorithms (circuits, neurons) are preserved the existence continues. Although in practice each of these things is actually changing from moment to moment. A new slightly different machine exists in each moment. The perception of self is just a long string of instantaneous different selfs.

If this is true there are huge implications in how we can manipulate our existence. Self can be paused, restarted, serialized, transmitted, duplicated, joined, edited. It can be expressed in different mediums. All without any kind of magical principle and without breaking our perception of our existence. Simply with better versions of technicalogical principals we already possess.

ff7usu,PM_BiscuitsAndGravy,"Science is Incomplete, and Why I Should Probably Stop Saying That","I have gotten into two discussions on the Internet over the last month about the incompleteness of science. There was an article posted here about it a few days ago that some of you may recall. If you care to wade through my banal Reddit comment history you can probably find it. My position: science is incomplete. I dare anyone to prove otherwise.  

&lt;Sound of pitchforks being sharpened.&gt; 

Saying that seems to freak people out. Stay with me though. Prove to me that you can put emotion aside and be rational here.

Elaboration of my position: Science gives us some pretty trustworthy theories, but probably a vast minority of facts compared to what we do not yet know. I only say this because I think it is useful for a scientist to occasionally hold up his/her work to an imagined future peer, say, hundreds of years in the future. I think such thought experiments can help detect bias and generate new hypotheses. Such humility and constant questioning is good for the scientific mind. I do not say this to disparage science.

Promulgating this position not only makes the Internet mad, it makes my husband mad too. After arguing about it with him tonight at dinner, I have come around to understanding why stating “science in incomplete” is met with such vehemence in 2020 scientific society. 

During the dinner discussion, my husband continually lumped my argument in with climate deniers, anti-vaxxers, and any politician who defunds scientific actions/grants.  Confused, I insisted: I love science; I think science needs more funding; I support action on climate change based on the current theories; I support vaccinations. Incomplete as it may be, science is the best we have. To that, the husband says the problem with saying, “science is incomplete,” is that it gives the uninformed and ill-intentioned people a rallying cry against science.

My conclusion: for those philosophers out there encouraging people to re-evaluate beliefs and strive to position their breadth of knowledge in a historically cognizant context, apparently we need to be careful to not give ammo to the masses against science. Science is vulnerable; science is persecuted. Pleas to be rational about our breadth of knowledge can be misconstrued. Being publicly honest about the incompleteness of science can be a detriment to scientific progress.

I have been convinced it is in the best interest of science at large in 2020 to start keeping this dangerous notion to myself. Maybe starting now.

I am sure the slug came from someplace, i.e, a baby is some dirt or moss that was added, and has grown, but I noted that the overall salt content (the natural desiccant) of the environment is not stable for the slug... he will die sooner or later with contact.  She said I had no right to play god. I posed a paradox: right now that slug is being sustained; He was nourished and would I not be playing god if I removed him from the environment that he was nurtured in...?

ff2wlh,goodbunny6969,Does Someone Knows who wrote this,"I found this interesting quote on the internet about Kant, Guenon, Spengler and Marx. I would like to know who wrote this because it's interesting, and it seems something Nick Land would say about the esoterism of time and space:

""In both of the previous generations, one paid great attention to the relationship we have to values. If one can trust the multiple and careful inventories of our fortune, which this time has brought forth, then our historical rank might have to be set quite low. The critique of this time has gained in sharpness and maliciousness and one cannot claim that we are brought up to overestimate our achievements.

We are more inclined to afford criticism a rank which appears rather precarious. It does indeed have its limits, and there is no criticism capable of extracting itself from the overall view of its time and making judgements from a higher position. Where this nevertheless happens, one must establish what certainties and what criteria form the basis of such judgement.
Obviously, one seeks to secure such criteria through comparison. In fact, the method is that such critique seeks to carve out for itself a foundation of historical achievements, and then proceed from them to approach the present. This method seems plausible; it is, however, dependent upon the presupposition of a linear unfolding of time as a unitary phenomenon; in other words, a certain past corresponds to a certain present – otherwise a unitary, consistent measure is unthinkable.

One must, however, know that the merciless assessments to which this time is subjected, and which we find confirmed in so many minute details, are both accurate and inaccurate. This is because the uniform division of time into past, present and future, whilst it may be adequate for astronomical time, it is not for the time of life, or the time of destiny. There is one astronomical time, but simultaneously a multitude of life times whose rhythm ticks like the pendulum swings of innumerable clocks next to each another.
So there isn’t a single time, the time, but a multiplicity of times, which raise their claim upon man. Thus it is to be explained that a generation is at the same time older and younger than that of the fathers, that it belongs therefore to two different times. Now, it depends a great deal on the perspective from which one is capable of seeing time. One stands upon it as if upon a carpet and sees that the old pattern is woven right up to the edges. Or one sees that the fabric builds itself up to entirely new and different figures. Both perspectives are valid, and so it can be that one and the same phenomenon appears both as the symbol of the end and of the beginning. In the sphere of death everything becomes the symbol of death, and, in turn, death is the element which nourishes life.""",1,1583620824,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ff2wlh/does_someone_knows_who_wrote_this/,philosophy,1

fewnru,Watuetu,Objective Truths.. Why they are meaningless.,"To begin.. i have no idea if i am right.. i am simply trying to follow paths of logic as they appear to me.

In regards to Objectivity, i believe that we as a species do not consider this word correctly.

An objective fact is not influenced by personal feelings or opinions.. this is correct.

But what if you ask the objective question.. “What is an objective fact?”.

The answer is: An objective fact is a conscious thought process of the human species, which helps them to define their physical reality from their personal and individual subjective conscious thoughts.

This means.. an objective fact does not exist without a subjective person to see it.

Facts are a human creation.. the Universe does not care if something is true..

The Universe is..

And we exist within it.. applying our thoughts of objectivity and subjectivity upon it. 
None of that means anything to the Universe.

Therefore if we agree (for the sake of this conversation) that objectivity cannot exist without the subjective individual to perceive it.. this would mean that even an objective fact is subjective.. because it is the perception of a subjective individual.

An objective fact is the thought process of an individual discerning their subjective thoughts from their physical reality.  

If we can then classify “objectivity” and “subjectivity” as thought processes of a subjective individual.. 
then we can also take the standpoint that for the subjective individual.. both their subjective and objective thoughts.... do objectively exist.

All of this nonsense is just simply word gymnastics. We can agree or disagree with this.. but the question is “Does it matter to the Universe what we think.. regardless of it’s objectivity or subjectivity?”

I am theorising that.. none of these thought processes of ours mean ANYTHING..

If this is objectively true, then if a subjective consciousness asked any questions of morality.. the objective answer would be “believe in and do whatever makes you happy, because although it means nothing to the Universe, you do objectively exist as a subjective consciousness.. so do whatever makes you happy”.

This would obviously lead to the questions of HOW you would create a society using this understanding..

As a living mechanism whose principal purpose is to live and spread, it would be a contradiction in our fundamental code which is dedicated to fuel our volition for life, to encourage an honest acknowledgment of our objective worth and meaning. On the other hand, in the favor of our individual thriving and survival, the fundamental code equips all humans with the egocentric viewpoint which is the most typical characteristic of mankind. Without this illusion humanity would not be as advanced nor diverse and colorful as it is today. Without this blindness human spirituality would be motionless, grey and dry. Therefore, everything what is astonishing about humanity is a product of the egocentric viewpoint. Still, it is wicked, slippery, dramatic and ridiculous because of its distortion.

Analyzing an individual’s objective worth, we do not get high number. Of course, a special and original subject could make an impact on the world but they are immensely rare. Eventually it is inevitable to realize that most humans are just conscious-less pieces at highest tables of power games and numbers in statistics. Sure, we all have lives, emotions, wills and belongings, but in the eye of history these are invisible. The infinite ocean of time swallows most of us in a century or less. And after we sank, the ones who did not have a particular effect on our civilization are like they never ever existed. Since anything they had done could had been done by anybody else, therefore, their presence was insignificant. The worth of a human is measureable in their works and creations, because as soon as we die, in the eyes of history we are like we never even existed. The things which can remain instead of us are thoughts or objects we created in our lifetimes. Through these we are able to achieve immortality and make an impact on the world.

However, the masses of humanity do not create anything valuable nor meaningful in their lives, so when they die that was is. Since their existence was insignificant and in the moment of death they are utterly gone from history, we have to make a conclusion that their initial egocentric viewpoint was right and the wisest, even if they never realized their role and were completely unaware of the objective world surrounding them.

The hidden wisdom of the egocentric viewpoint is jauntily embraceable and the reasoning behind it is pleasing. Since I cannot make an impact on the world and statistically my existence is entirely insignificant, I have no reason to worry about it. Therefore, my only purpose in life is to have fun, find whatever makes me happy. There is no point grieving meaning because we don’t have one. The meaning is just having a good time while we can, pleasing our biologic needs.",0,1583581223,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/feu2bb/wisdom_of_blindness/,philosophy,1
fetk75,Watuetu,Are Objective and Subjective Truths Meaningless?,"To begin.. i have no idea if i am right.. i am simply trying to follow paths of logic as they appear to me.

I am unable to clearly define the topic below.. 

But if i tried i would say that “this is a conversation with myself about objective and subjective facts being equal in their meaningless... And what implications this could have for Humans, should we choose to accept this understanding within our society.”

In regards to Objectivity, i believe that we as a species do not consider this word correctly.

An objective fact is not influenced by personal feelings or opinions.. this is correct.

But what if you ask the objective question.. “What is an objective fact?”.

The answer is: An objective fact is a conscious thought process of the human species, which helps them to define their physical reality from their personal and individual subjective conscious thoughts.

This means.. an objective fact does not exist without a subjective person to see it.

Facts are a human creation.. the Universe does not care if something is true..

The Universe is..

And we exist within it.. applying our thoughts of objectivity and subjectivity upon it. 
None of that means anything to the Universe.

Therefore if we agree (for the sake of this conversation) that objectivity cannot exist without the subjective individual to perceive it.. this would mean that even an objective fact is subjective.. because it is the perception of a subjective individual.

An objective fact is the thought process of an individual discerning their subjective thoughts from their physical reality.  

If we can then classify “objectivity” and “subjectivity” as thought processes of a subjective individual.. 
then we can also take the standpoint that for the subjective individual.. both their subjective and objective thoughts.... do objectively exist.

All of this nonsense is just simply word gymnastics. We can agree or disagree with this.. but the question is “Does it matter to the Universe what we think.. regardless of it’s objectivity or subjectivity?”

I am theorising that.. none of these thought processes of ours mean ANYTHING..

If this is objectively true, then if a subjective consciousness asked any questions of morality.. the objective answer would be “believe in and do whatever makes you happy, because although it means nothing to the Universe, you do objectively exist as a subjective consciousness.. so do whatever makes you happy”.

This would obviously lead to the questions of HOW you would create a society using this understanding..

But what are peoples thoughts on this being logically sound...?",1,1583577725,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fetk75/are_objective_and_subjective_truths_meaningless/,philosophy,1

fepumc,Global-Shock,Mathematics is 75% Invented and 25% Discovered,"I just want to get this off my chest,

We as a human species tend to do things without question while under authoritative governing principles, similar to math but I'll get to that point in a little bit. A lot of us get up and work from 9-5 because it is universally accepted to be a part of society without question of it. We read words from the dictionary and almost never question the origins of such words.

The only real question is, 

Why don't most people want to question these things themselves or try to understand why they do these things without question? I hope it isn't out of fear of possibly thinking for yourselves and drawing your own logical conclusions. And the same can be said for mathematics to a varying extent.

Most people on any topic automatically want to think they are right because they are afraid of possibly being wrong. 
I used to be that kind of a person but I am not anymore and it has allowed me to keep an open mind and question everything in the world in which we reside in. Of course it has also allowed me to be more accepting of people's differing opinions if you are thinking. That's just a way of life.

But this all leads up to my main topic which is about math,

Math is done mostly without the question of why we accepted such things to be true if there is no distinct evidence pointing in ""that"" direction, hence ""axiomatically true."" We accept that (a+b=c) is true. No questions or proof needed. But the problem isn't what we universally accept as true today, but was this ""obviously"" true 5,000 years ago before the invention of most languages? Or the invention of... numbers, notations and letters so to speak? I will discuss postulation/axioms much later again.

Before I work on that point, 

Let me just state the obvious here. If you only believe math was discovered, you better have a good reason for where the numbers representing the quantities of things in nature came from if it wasn't from humans. Not to mention you would probably get the Nobel prize if you could prove otherwise. I'd be surprised to see clouds raining the number ""5"" when there are ""5"" rain clouds hovering above or seeing the number ""10"" growing from an apple tree once ""10"" apples grew from that apple tree. Yes, we discovered quantities of things but certainly not numbers.

So which leads to my next point,

Abstract concepts. All numbers and even mathematical letters, ""taken from the Greek language initially,"" such as ""Sigma"" are abstract concepts. Languages aside, You cannot hear, taste, smell numbers. Plato is a great example of this very problem. AKA Plato's heaven theory. Counter argument against the argument against Plato's view by me: How can you ever be aware of numbers/notations in the universe if numbers/notations never existed in the universe until humans invented them to mean what they wanted those numbers to mean? It's sounds more like a placebo effect than anything else and it leads back straight to my very first points about the river and the apple tree. Let's pretend it's the year 1000 CE and sigma existed then. I wanted to incorporate the summation letter with another letter. Who's to say that I'm wrong for representing ""Sigma"" as the old Scot's letter ȝ which is ""Yogh?"" 

Along with that, let's make it even more interesting,

Remember, it's still 1,000 CE and sigma existed already. 
""Assume ȝ is our sum of a series. Sum of x, from 0 to 2."" Does the method actually change? No. All I did was change the notation to mean the same exact thing as sigma axiomatically. Hush, hush no questions, remember? It has to be this way now.


My next point,

Since numbers are invented and not discovered and you can't change something that is discovered for what it is regardless of before or after scenarios, you discovered it in such a way, period. Let's pretend It's 7,000 BCE and I discovered two volcanoes. My language is very limited also. But something about two volcanoes amuses me and I wanted to remember it in some form or another. In front of me I have a stick and some mud. In front of the volcanoes I draw two ""Us."" The ""Us"" are connected. It is coincidentally shaped very similarly to the ""3"" in the future English numerals. I then write it in my primitive language as ""Yooyoo"" because those are the words that come to this primitive mind at this time when describing these quantities. This represents this primitive human's understanding of the quantities of something and so now it must be more than a single volcano so he decides to draw in the mud for memory the single volcano... etc. Is he wrong? Is there an authoritative presence telling him he's wrong in the realm of abstract thinking? Not at all. Now eventually his civilization will build up and start representing quantities this way. 

Next point,

11+5 = 16... right!?!? Well, umm... no. Why? You might ask? Because I didn't give any context for the meaning of these numbers yet. Aha. It may be universally accepted due to the way our mathematical system is logically built up today to say that 
11 + 5 = 16 because axiomatically, addition is ""adding"" and subtracting is ""minusing"" etc. But does this always work with any given context? I beg to differ. 11P.M + 5 hours = 4A.M. Aha. In this case the math works like this; 
11+5 = 4... A.M. Because we are referring to the clock now. Something they do not teach you in school but it is not wrong given the context. Remember that.

This works the same way Einstein disagrees with 1+1=2 in some cases. What's the implication? Well Einstein thought that just because numbers work without any physical aspects applied to them so 1+1=2 hence, abstract concepts since we cannot either touch, smell, hear numbers. Instead, When looking at physical/tangible objects, we see ""2"" of them right? Again, depends on the context. Einstein agrees with me. He says, sure, 2 objects but unless they have equal mass, density or volume with the same exact dimensions then it can only really equal a pair of 2, yes. So 1 brick + 1 brick with a slightly smaller dimension in the corner of the brick with equal mass, density and slightly less volume might be something like 1+0.944 =1.944. Isn't that funny. Since one of the bricks doesn't have the completely same physical qualities, then it does not equal to 2 of the same pair physically. These axioms do not work in the physical world because numbers aren't discovered and have no physical aspects to them. This is why we have physics which Einstein was good at.

Which leads to my next point,

In physics there are no mathematical axioms. Why? Because in physics we explain the physical world with physical applications. Math by itself does not have an inherent trait with the real world. Once again, physical applications brings math to the scientific world view. We cannot assume anything exists without evidence. Hence, the opposite of an axiom. And because physics is binded to the scientific method. We have proved a lot of things in time thus far with physics... I'm sure you know of course. Yes, using the tool of math to explain physical phenomena is possible because it so happens to be a great tool when used in conjunction with physics. Physics must be experimentally tested and observed to be a fact. Not math.  You cannot make up axioms in physics to promote a hypothesis that you cannot possibly experiment with and observe and or not understand in the first place as a starting point for a hypothesis for that matter. You cannot accept something for what it is without the burden of proof in physics. It goes against the scientific method and is anti-scientific. Both subjects have logic instilled into them but physics seems to be more logically superior considering my whole argument and I can't really at all find fault with how math is dealt with in physics if I was asked. Gödel in his incompleteness theorems acknowledged the limitations math has by itself and he wasn't a physicist. 

Another point,

Since numbers by themselves sit in their own world within the human imagination, you can always make up your own rules as you go with postulations, right? Go ahead. That's pure mathematics research right there. Although applied math still falls into this trap of the numbers and notations having no meaning in the first place as I prove here by proving that starting at 0 on a ruler makes no difference compared to 2. The unsettling part is that this is supposed to be applied math. Where's the proof? Okay. Go get a ruler and find an object that is, oh, about 6 by 6 inches long. Let's pretend you want to build the same object again. Apply your ruler to it but instead of starting at 0' start at 2' instead. But start the ruler where you would start the ruler at 0' but at the 2' mark instead on the object so you get 8' that way. You obviously get 6' in length at 0' ""the right way."" Notice that it doesn't matter whether you started at 0' or 2' or 4 in? That's because the object never changes and you could still set up a schematic or blueprint that way if rulers were made to start at 2 in. The object will still be built the same way but the only things that change are the numbers of course. Those numbers once again prove to have no meaning in this application even with applied math. Now you just have to convince the world to start making rulers at 2' instead of 
0 inches... and then 14' to end the ruler in the case of 2' of course. And... if you really cared about the smaller increments of measurements you can erase the first 30 batch of increments, start at 2 1/16 inches and build the ruler all the way up again and making sure you added that extra 30 increments to the end of the ruler which should get you to that new 14' mark. And already assuming the other two 16/16 and 1 16/16 increments are already being established as the whole numbers in my contentions as I speak. Voila.

Last point,

Math does indeed lead to discoveries due to the invention of numbers and notations. Math leads to lots of discoveries which then in return causes other people to invent lots and lots of other fields of mathematics where numbers and notations have whole different meanings. Even those invented numbers and postulations lead to some worthwhile hypotheses to possibly look into, ""let's be honest, hypotheses you can't use 99.99% of the time,"" but some do have that very small 0.1% chance of making a profound discovery if using an application that is of real world use. Such as Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science etc. But remember, it isn't just the math, it's the foundation of those methodologies within the fields of science that really validates those 0.1% math formulas.

A dumb illogical mathematical axiom that should be abolished, RANT:

Due to the sheer non simplicity of this logic and ""almost"" inexplicable nature of this answer when looking at a math problem associating something such as 8^0 should seem to be rather easy to understand by just looking at it but the fact that it isn't when providing an explanation is somewhat ludicrous so therefore I never really understood to this day ""logically... need I say logically again? Oh there,"" why 
anything to the ^0 power is equal to 1 because anything to the power is multiplying by itself. All the math teachers I asked were stumped about why would I asked such a question? Funny thing is... they had no answer surprisingly because it probably isn't worth explaining. The logical fallacy behind this is 0^0 power = undefined and not 0 even though 0×0=0 Are you kidding me? Any finite number such as 99^0=1. But wait, 99×0=0 Why not!? While 1^0=1 and 1^1=1... yet all the other finite numbers such as 98^1=98 equal themselves. Anything to the ^1 makes a lot of sense since it is just the number representing itself as an exponent. But for ^0, Did I just find an illogical double standard in math pertaining to ""1?"" and possibly even ""0"" since 0 is a number also, once again? Go figure. This is another problem. Are we making up rules clandestinely in the background as well? No, seriously? This is another great point in my argument then if that's the case. I disagree with the explanation because it is like I said, non simplistic for what the answer is worth compared to all the other easily understood exponents.

Conclusion,

Math by itself is just abstract thinking in the realm of math which has no physical scope. There's no other way to put it. It has no real physical purpose until it reaches physics or any of the branches of science for that matter. And most of math by itself is subjective if you are using numbers for different contexts besides the non physical aspects of addition, subtraction etc. Remember? The clock, Einstein's issues, the ruler, Plato's issues, Gödel's contention of mathematical limits etc. I wrote an equation on a piece of paper and solved it, congratulations. Did it explain anything physically? No, well then it was useless unless you like doing it for fun. Michio Kaku was even more critical about math without science in a similar case with regards to my above statement. Do you like doing math as a subordinate hobby? Do you like it because of the cool symbols? Do you use other symbols for the same methods because it looks artistic... why not? Does it help increase your mental capacity as a whole for other things in life? If so then that's good. Although this is my opinion, I hope to spark some thoughts to some people out there. And just like my first question I could've argued for days about the flaws of the English language and working 9-5 for 50 years the same way I did with the subject of math. Moral of the story, question everything in life. You'd be amazed what kind of things start being rather peculiar than you initially thought while being adamant.

The object will still be built the same way but the only things that change are the numbers of course. Those numbers once again prove to have no meaning in this application even with applied math. Now you just have to convince the world to start making rulers at 2' instead of 

0 inches... and then 14' to end the ruler in the case of 2' of course. And... if you really cared about the smaller increments of measurements you can erase the first 30 batch of increments, start at 2 1/16 inches and build the ruler all the way up again and making sure you added that extra 30 increments to the end of the ruler which should get you to that new 14' mark. And already assuming the other two 16/16 and 1 16/16 increments are already being established as the whole numbers in my contentions as I speak. Voila.

&amp;#x200B;

Last point,

&amp;#x200B;

Math does indeed lead to discoveries due to the invention of numbers and notations. Math leads to lots of discoveries which then in return causes other people to invent lots and lots of other fields of mathematics where numbers and notations have whole different meanings. Even those invented numbers and postulations lead to some worthwhile hypotheses to possibly look into, ""let's be honest, hypotheses you can't use 99.99% of the time,"" but some do have that very small 0.1% chance of making a profound discovery if using an application that is of real world use. Such as Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science etc. But remember, it isn't just the math, it's the foundation of those methodologies within the fields of science that really validates those 0.1% math formulas.

&amp;#x200B;

A dumb illogical mathematical axiom that should be abolished, RANT:

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the sheer non simplicity of this logic and ""almost"" inexplicable nature of this answer when looking at a math problem associating something such as 8\^0 should seem to be rather easy to understand by just looking at it but the fact that it isn't when providing an explanation is somewhat ludicrous so therefore I never really understood to this day ""logically... need I say logically again? Oh there,"" why 

anything to the \^0 power is equal to 1 because anything to the power is multiplying by itself. All the math teachers I asked were stumped about why would I asked such a question? Funny thing is... they had no answer surprisingly because it probably isn't worth explaining. The logical fallacy behind this is 0\^0 power = undefined and not 0 even though 0×0=0 Are you kidding me? Any finite number such as 99\^0=1. But wait, 99×0=0 Why not!? While 1\^0=1 and 1\^1=1... yet all the other finite numbers such as 98\^1=98 equal themselves. Anything to the \^1 makes a lot of sense since it is just the number representing itself as an exponent. But for \^0, Did I just find an illogical double standard in math pertaining to ""1?"" and possibly even ""0"" since 0 is a number also, once again? Go figure. This is another problem. Are we making up rules clandestinely in the background as well? No, seriously? This is another great point in my argument then if that's the case. I disagree with the explanation because it is like I said, non simplistic for what the answer is worth compared to all the other easily understood exponents.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion,

&amp;#x200B;

Math by itself is just abstract thinking in the realm of math which has no physical scope. There's no other way to put it. It has no real physical purpose until it reaches physics or any of the branches of science for that matter. And most of math by itself is subjective if you are using numbers for different contexts besides the non physical aspects of addition, subtraction etc. Remember? The clock, Einstein's issues, the ruler, Plato's issues, Gödel's contention of mathematical limits etc. I wrote an equation on a piece of paper and solved it, congratulations. Did it explain anything physically? No, well then it was useless unless you like doing it for fun. Michio Kaku was even more critical about math without science in a similar case with regards to my above statement. Do you like doing math as a subordinate hobby? Do you like it because of the cool symbols? Do you use other symbols for the same methods because it looks artistic... why not? Does it help increase your mental capacity as a whole for other things in life? If so then that's good. Although this is my opinion, I hope to spark some thoughts to some people out there. And just like my first question I could've argued for days about the flaws of the English language and working 9-5 for 50 years the same way I did with the subject of math. Moral of the story, question everything in life. You'd be amazed what kind of things start being rather peculiar than you initially thought while being adamant.

feawjw,crox1c,"If another does not depend on you for their life or livelihood, and if you have not struggled in order to maintain that responsibility, you do not know real suffering, or responsibility, or the strength that comes from adopting said responsibility.","Life is full of suffering, and throughout history the cure to that suffering has been adopting responsibility. Shouldering responsibility results in strength, and gives peoples' lives a real and persistent sense of identity, and of meaning, in a way that few other things can. 

Nowadays - because of the benefits of technology, infrastructure, and wealth - at least in America, many of us are insulated from much of that suffering.

When a kid scrapes their knee, it's the worst pain ever. They scream, wail, and cry. And for them, it is, because they've never felt anything worse. It sucks for them, and we don't blame them for crying; we understand. Because we were there, once. But, as they get older, the scraped knees don't hurt anymore - because they've surely broken a bone, or experienced something far worse by that point in their life. They learn from the pain, they gain perspective, and they grow. 

We live in a culture where anonymous comments on the internet can constitute oppression, where policy disagreement is considered by many to be hate speech, where the 'man' in 'human' is considered discriminatory or marginalizing, where saying 'hello' can constitute sexual harassment.

Meanwhile, there are those around the world who truly know the meanings of these words - people being thrown off of rooftops for having the wrong sexual orientation, women forced to cover themselves and lacking a voice in their own destiny, where hierarchical minorities lack the right to vote and are subject to genocide, where women are brutalized by tribal warfare and have no recourse or avenue of escape, where basic infrastructure is lacking, where children often die in infancy due to disease and starvation, and so they are not named. 

As a people, I feel we've become so insulated from the suffering of life that even the smallest slights can provoke outrage, fear, and despair - because many in our nation have lost touch with real suffering. If we state that meaning is derived from suffering, and if one has not suffered, there can be no meaning, which is an untenable proposition for the ego, for the 'sense of self'. And so we create outrage, we create things to suffer over, we make small scratches into crippling wounds - because the pain sustains us, keeps us moving forward, gives us a sense of identity, however false, however fleeting.

It's statistically proven that those with a loose sense of self-identity are more at risk for depressive episodes and suicide, and the suicide rates in the United States have skyrocketed well over 20% in as many years despite significant advances being made in technology, infrastructure, and wealth. Meanwhile, the single parenthood rate has increased, divorce rates have increased, and the traditional family unit has lost prominence and popularity with younger people, as relationships and family ties are pushed back farther and father in pursuit of material ends and sex without attachment has become popularized. 

I would argue that these trends are not coincidental, and are in fact related.

There is real suffering in the world. I'm not one to say who has and who has not experienced that. Every person has an inherent burden of self-reflection. But I would make a case for the following, to any and all readers:

**tl;dr** \- If another does not depend on you for their life or livelihood, and if you have not struggled in order to maintain that responsibility, you do not know real suffering, or responsibility, or the strength that comes from adopting it. And if you feel like something is missing from your life, if you feel that you are lacking in meaning or identity, this may be the root cause.",2,1583485511,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/feawjw/if_another_does_not_depend_on_you_for_their_life/,philosophy,1

\-----------------------------------------------------

# Introduction

One of the most important facts that we must turn to, That Modernity movement that started in the West one and a half to two centuries ago with regard to the rights of women and theories that were born from this movement, which are lots and in many directions. If we want to understand them well, we must understand the intellectual, social and economic reality that generated This movement that led to the flourish of West.

Look at Islamic states. see these forty or fifty years in the system of these states. You find many ideas raised that does not exist at all before, but it is now the intellectual and cultural reality that led to it.

How much was the scientific researches, thought, culture and official institutions concerned with the issue of governance in Islam? But now hundreds of studies, writings and lessons are all looking for governance in Islam Why? Because social streaks became this way.

However, you do not find a counterpart in the past. Why? Because the social, political, intellectual and cultural realities have led to it and even might you don’t find such things in other regions.

From here we conclude this fact, which is that **ideas, philosophies and philosophical theories are not above time and place** and this is what **post-modernism** has stated, they said that we cannot put a philosophical theory above time and place.

So, on this basis, if this fact becomes clear when we come to the western theories and feminist’s movement, etc. how we must read them now? We must read it in its cultural, social and intellectual realities that produced these theories.

The question I want to enter with it, **how should we deal with the thought presented to us** taking into account where these ideas originate from?

Should we close the door on it and never study it or as some people accept it as if they are absolute facts or there is another direction behind these?

In the introduction I must refer to the historical epochs that Western thought went through, if we use the language of contemporary European historians, history will be divided into three basic stages:

· Greco-Roman world

This is the first stage that spanned from the fifth century B.C. Socrates era to the fifth century A.D. and lasted for ten centuries.

· Middle Ages

lasted from the fall of Roman in the West in 476 in the fifth century to the fall of the Byzantine empire by the Ottoman Turks 1453, also approximately ten other centuries

· Modern era

Post-Middle Ages era about 4-5 centuries and continues to this day.

These are what we have with in the history of West. Of course, there are multiple branches and diversities. But What do Muslims have?

The Golden Islamic era are within the time of Middle Ages, However the West were in the era of darkness. Muslim used to live in the age of modernity, but rather the Islamic modernity and It was the center of the world, but since the naming of the Middle Ages is infamous with the West and surrounded by negativity in the Arab and European consciousness because the Middle Ages were the centuries of darkness, we feel great pain and anger because the best of us is classified in the name medieval, this leads me to re-search the history of Islam in a way In line with the respect of our history, so then what are the periods that Islam went through?

· Production Age

The emergence of Islam in the seventh century AD ending with the death of Ibn-Rushd in the twelfth century. These five six centuries that produced all of our ideas and thoughts in various directions from Sunnis, Shiites, Mu'tazila and Ash'ari that govern our reality regardless of scientific, natural researches and the discoveries in astronomy, physics, chemistry were all connected to those centuries, the stage of production was the era of transculturation as well? Because in these centuries the other thought began translated through the House of Wisdom established by Al-Maamoun for the expalme  the Greek, Indian, and Persian philosophy in other words philosophy in all its dimensions also from the various human sciences and medicine that came from that period.

· The era of decadence

The age of rumination and repetition to the past works It represents our Middle Ages, which were the ages of darkness starting from the six seven century AH (13th century AD) to the thirteenth century AH (19th century AD) remains for six to seven centuries however still remains some intellectual flashes like Ibn-Khaldoun in the eighth century AH(the end of 13th century AD), but these were exceptions from the rule.

Muslim in That era was outside history does not know what's going on in the world in contrast West From the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and after they entered into fights with Catholic church and extremist ideas and with the shocking industrial, digital revolutions until they brought Western thought to this day.

The West is moving forward and the Muslims are in a deep sleep, until they turned in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and found that these are ahead by light years and not by ordinary years. Look at us, where are we? So, Muslims started the movement in the nineteenth century.

But do you know the difference? They started in the fifteenth century and Muslims started in the nineteenth century How many? How do you want to fill the gap?

Muslims may not believe because of the miserable situation that we have reached that we were once masters of this civilized world and that our philosophers and our scholars were seven centuries ago representing the supreme authority of the great thinkers of the European continent of dozens and when I say thinkers then I mean Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, Ibn Bajah and Ibn Rushd mainly who renew the philosophical thought and this is what led the other to need us.

Then how we should deal with the thought presented to us with that huge gap?

The answer is philosophy, that you live the questions of your time and the truth of philosophy in two things: to live the questions of your time and raise the problems of your time.

You are the son of your time, I mean, what are the questions of your time and answering those questions? In various dimensions, there is never a red line in the question. Any question in your era must be raised and you must find the answer to it.

The Muslims died the day when philosophy died. I mean, when they died, they stop asking about the problems of their times. They only contented themselves to read the questions of the times of their ancestors.

The secret of philosophy is translation and opening up to others. Whoever does not translate does not allow a new blood flow in his veins, dries a little and dies, and this is what happened in Islamic history. Translation and openness are what excites and provokes you, A world of new questions and new excitements requires a new mind of philosophers to solve.

In the past ten years, all my concern in my scientific work pose a new question, no but provocations that provoked the Arab mind and never answer? Because I want you to live the problem and say what is the solution?

Otherwise if I gave you the question and the solution to it Do you think or not? Your mind becomes what? Thinking mind or resigned mind?

Until now Muslims are sitting here and consuming West ideas, intellectual, industrial and natural production even in the way they cut their hair they also imitate them.

Look at our culture and people in all of our societies. go to Europe, but are they drowning or not? Thousands drowning, are they stop going to Europe or not? Why? Because they want to live a decent life, not least. His sense of a decent life. Now he may be mistaken, but their feeling is that a decent life is in there? why is this sensation? How do we deal with the other, so what is the way? 

My dear, there are several ways these are:

The first position: To go to the West and be obedient follower of the Western thought, and this is what you now find in many of the writings. did they mention about Islam or not? Never they have nothing to do with it.

The second position: reverence for heritage only, and this is the Salaf trend now, Of course, when I say Salafi, your mind does not only go to Wahhabism and Ibn Taymiyyah or Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab, no. Everyone who sees that the first century of Islam is the best of the centuries.

The third position: (a lot more severe) revering the West and insulting the Islamic thought, being ridiculous of the whole heritage, past, thoughts, culture, customs, gains and what we have saved for centuries, we put them in the trash.

The fourth position: reverence the heritage and delete everything that comes from the West as their thought being dangerous and may cause devastation of the society, Really, I don’t know how this came from.

These are the main 4 positions however I will share my position later in this book.",2,1583407810,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fdtwwy/lecture1_thoughts_on_modernity_and_postmodernism/,philosophy,1

fdac5v,TheLongBlueFace,"""Your opinion is different from mine which means you're close-minded""","I will often get this attitude from people that don't agree with me on a topic. They will just resort to saying I'm close-minded simply because I disagree with them. These will typically be when I'm defying beliefs held by the status quo. Some examples are when I speak in support of atheism, veganism, or antinatalism. I don't understand how adopting beliefs that defy my pre-held beliefs is considered close-minded. Like I wasn't born Atheist, vegan or anti-natalist. It was only through being open minded and entertaining beliefs I didn't initially agree with that I was able to change my beliefs, after comparing the arguments for or against it. Is this just people projecting or something? If people want to make arguments against my beliefs, they are welcome to do so but if I don't automatically agree with their arguments because I think they're flawed and illogical, it makes me close-minded? Okay. Do people just jump to this as their last resort if they feel like they can't make a good argument? 

Side note: People will often try to discredit what I say by making personal attacks. Religious people and natalists have often said stuff like ""oh you just believe that because you're depressed."" Even though the argument would still be the same, regardless of who the messenger is. That would be like if someone said ""kale is healthy"" to which someone replies ""well you're fat so obviously kale can't be healthy.""

I'm not looking to argue for or against the topics I've mentioned in this post, as it's not the purpose of the post. I just used personal examples that applied to me.

fbvqa9,Earthbound-123,The philosophy of perspective and existence.,"Preface-

I

In the idea of good and evil, you must turn to epistemology. Epistemology the branch from the tree of knowledge and academic philosophy on what is right and separates the line between evidence and opinion over the lenses of human perspective. The existential crisis battling debate spreading bloodshed in my mind, the questions building up in my head for years now being hitherto answered as I ask myself, hypothetically, if all knowledge was an expansive river in the center of metaphysical space and time, we have indeed not reached that point yet in are journey of life and time. Maybe once the outer-body experience once we close in on death and taken in the black grips of death, will we find the answers? Definitely not in life as its been centuries now and no one really knows what is beyond life, good, evil, your consciousness that inhabits minds and body, the soul beneath your skin and flesh bathing in your blood and yet not even your small mind can pander answers of this magnitude. After we pass may we see that river of all knowledge? Dance and play in it with your ancestors in the waters, knowledge at the tips of your fingers.

The meaning of life... It just seems that we co-exist with nature which nature is the broad and grand spectrum on space and what began is what we can't know like the beginning of the universe and the meaning of life and how perspective is gained in the grand idea of consciousness in all life, humans, mammals and or extra-terrestrials, it just seems like we are here and the beginning of consciousness is obscured by the universe in one way or another. Perhaps, what is going on the worlds greatest metaphysicists and philosophers is just as empty as the south china skies filled with smog at night.

I

As time goes on, I read through the history books and in my older days I have seen something perplexing and morbidly fascinating which in turn turned my interest into a concerning obsession with decapitation. The french guillotine from France during the revolution at the time, I was in third grade and with a intelligent mind I used smooth legos to build the frame of the guillotine and a pencil sharpener raiser blade from the death blade connected by sticks and held up by a rope. I used lego men and tied them down to a board I made which was able to slide them into the hole of which decapitation was prevalent as well as a basket underneath for the head to plop into. I would drop the rope which in retrospect was just a blue piece of yarn I'd let go of and the blade would come arching down fast and efficiently decapitate the victim of execution and to my satisfaction, the head would fall into the basket. I'd spend up until midnight doing this and my mother was rather supportive on my academic understanding on physics and acceleration speeds, she was grossed out by the concept though. This is what sparked my fascination wit death and and the questions arose in my mind, is anything even real, what is after death, what is after life and what was the beginning of life and the secrets of consciousness. The metaphysical questions on existential being really had no clear answer and I will go on my philosophy on life and beyond good and evil.

II

Look at your fingers and tell yourself what you see.

You see your fingers and you know that it is there because you can touch them, see them, feel them... But what are these senses you are describing, we have more senses than five from when you learned in school, five senses, wrong. People say this is like your sixth sense; proprioception, your awareness of position on what limb is what direction and where. Though can you really trust your senses, I can't at all and feel that your senses are a physiological illusion of the mind. The fact that there is no answers to my questions is what boggles my mind and I am waiting to find an answer.

reality is real, right? The world around you is a land field of information which where does that information go to? It is you, the information goes toward you from all your senses so basically you like in a fortress which is your body and the body you inhabit like a ghost causing a possession, your fortress is within the matrix or a simulation of sorts and that matrix is seen as the world you here, you live and you thrive.There is no way for sure to know what is real and what isn't an illusion beyond your perception, everyone you know around you like food and your friends, family is just figment of your imagination and you are thriving in a imaginary world which is called solipsism.

The egocentric predicament

**Egocentric predicament**, a term coined by Ralph Barton Perry in an article (Journal of Philosophy 1910), is the problem of not being able to view reality outside of our own perceptions. All worldly knowledge takes the form of mental representations that our mind examines in different ways.

\-Wikipedia

I think the egocentric predicament is almost like solipsism which both completely contradict the idea of realism. Realism is the things you see and take in from your senses like your sight in hearing is indeed what is going on behind your mind and everything is real, although both these theories are impossible to tel true even with evidence because the final stop for information to go to is your brain and it is impossible to know that your vision is not your imagination so the egocentric predicament and solipsism are not true or false because they are both neutral sense obviously they are impossible to know factually it is true making the predicament unfalsifiable.

A woman named Tonda Lynn Ansely from Hamilton, Ohio murdered someone and was soon arrested by authority but was proven innocent because she testified in court saying that she was in the Matrix and everything didn't matter because nothing was real in the first place. The jury members and the judge believed in realism so they charged her with murder but innocent because she was clinically insane.

The matrix

Parts of the matrix became real in your memory and perspective once your reached that part of your imagination. The part of the world became real because you were there in space time for it to exist in your mind. Like you flying to Greece, Greece only existed once your encountered it in your mind.

My brother took a picture on his new phone that he said was so realistic that it was ""more realistic than life itself.""

What he said changed my life forever as what he said I kept my thoughts to myself but only ruminated about it and the longer I ruminated the more existentially ruined and curious I was, the curiosity building up to this, a long existential internal debate on what's real and what isn't. *How could you say something is more realistic that life?* I sat and pandered as the discussion between my mother and my brother continued. *What does life even look like beyond it even being filtered by my vision?* I sat there wondering to absolute insanity about the predicament and I kept my thoughts of this to myself until this very moment for everyone else to see, spread my ideas and let's just see if you will end up sleeping to night... If you even exist in the first place, perhaps I am talking to myself and your comments is just my subconscious opinions on this, I don't know but I can't stop wondering.

My vision is very poor and so I needed glasses to see the board from even the middle row of the classroom. How could you know what the would really looks like beyond it being filtered by your sense while being sucked into your mind? How would anyone even know actual? You will live the rest of your days living a lie in a perspective prison. 

I will break out this prospective prison and I want to know the meaning of life. 

 What is beyond life (The matrix)?

What is it? I have seen so many Reddit posts on Askreddit about themselves dying then being resuscitated back to life and they told in detail what they say, if they could even use detail. People with religions would often come forward saying that after you die, you go to heaven if you are good but if you are judged badly from god and the angels then you will suffer eternity in hell. In Muslim religion if a woman dies they'd go to heaven with a group of woman to become sex slaves to their owner in the afterlife or you'd burn in hell. All religions are from people contemplating the meaning of life and what is after death, they'd ask what is after death so in a form of comfort people will fabricate dogmatic believes to settle in peace and solitude with the existential beliefs. The dogma which has grown over time from person to person is what consumes their minds to believe this dogma is fact rather than opinion belief. The more people think about their own beliefs the more supernatural it is while being filled with holes from reality which in turn the dogma is revealed, these ideas come to mind, *This doesn't make any sense,* many ideologies say that one thing is inhumanly unnatural yet scientifically it is indeed a natural way of living and life, for example, homosexuality and or masturbation. What people said what they seen on the other side is just utter darkness, meaningless void of black darkness as they float in peace and silence for all eternity meaning that god doesn't exist, probably and there is no real afterlife so as a nihilist, nothing really matters so what is the point of doing anything? 

If there is no god, than the bible's moral standard is obsolete and not meaningful in the grand scheme of things. So, if an atheist has his own moral standards than it is much more impressive than anyone that follows a rule book from 100 years ago off stone tablets. 

What is anything then? Sometimes things just don't have an exact answer to them like what is good and evil. In dogma religion, evil is what contradicts the ideologies in it but sense god has no place in space and time then evil is obviously subjective and not at all objective, religion is just belief and not objective. Epistemology, The study of philosophy that distinguishes opinion from justified belief and once you did deeper in nihilistic epistemology, religion is not at all justified but a comforting opinion from man.  There is no such thing as good and evil then.

fbqylr,TomerTzurx,Getting Ready for Philosophy Studies,"Hello,

In about 10 months ill be leaving home to study Philosophy and Literature at the University of Tel-Aviv, and I would like to prepare as best I could. I read a lot of Philosophy books, mostly modern (Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche) but would always come to a point where the book is just filled with references I cannot understand, and that's why I decided to work my way into modern philosophy.

So my question is: what is the path into modern philosophy? I'm currently reading the Iliad &amp; Plato first writings, and after reading The Odyssey and Plato second writings, am  planning to move into Aristotle and read Ethics and Metamorphosis by Ovid. I'm trying to create a path where I'll read the greats of both literature and Philosophy (as I don't thing both are so different), and at the end get to ""Being and Time"" &amp; ""Being and Nothingness). So please dear reddit readers- help me plan my path!

fbqten,gugmanfera,WHO IS METATRON FOR YOU? TELL ME!!! I WILL TELL YOU,"This angel is in a special position within the esoteric doctrine. If you have the Jerusalem Bible which is the only one that I recommend, take an attentive look at the purely eschatological book of the prophet Daniel 12: 1 “’ At that time Michael will arise - the great Prince […]”. Meatron might be the angel Gabriel. I suggest reading from chapters 7 to 12 of the book of Daniel. You will realize that in the last days this angel will rise. According to John Calvin’s conception, this angel is compared to Christ himself. Therefore, Christ, being superior to the rest, is the head of the church and the protector. Following the Jewish conception, this angel is the Messiah who they have been waiting for, therefore, there will be a lot of suffering and many will look for knowledge everywhere. It will be a lost society that doesn’t know where to go. Therefore if you are right, then you are just and you will shine in the midst of the chaos. This angel will be of great importance for the eschatological fulfillment because if Calvin did a comparison with Jesus Christ himself, I claim that this angel might as well be the very manifestation of the Messiah, who is awaited by the nations. This is one of the mysteries of God to which we should pay attention and put aside without obtaining knowledge about what is yet to come. This angel that the Kabbalah points out is mentioned in Exodus 23: 21 about whom it is written: “… and obey what he says. Do not defy him … for my name is in him”. I won’t get too deep into such speculations, but I believe in angels as spiritual beings who are mingled with the human nature. Be careful when you offend your neighbor, because he may be an angel whose presence had better be respected. If God and the incarnated word made himself as one of us, let alone the material angels.

There seems to be a couple of camps regarding the issue. People like Jonathan Heidt would argue it's an aspect of limited multi level selection however people like Dawkins or Harris argue against the validity of that concept.

So, with this currently being the cutting edge of evolutionary science. What's the 'leading' and most logical reason humans developed the ability to abstract so far beyond reality - that it has allowed people for probably the entirety of history to believe in (evidentiary) fictions of higher beings?

What's the fitness payout if the Dawkins/Harris are wrong?

I can see the payout from the multi level selection camp, which makes more sense to me. However most evolutionary biologists attach themselves highly to individual selection, which to me makes this issues almost unresolvable.

Religion and belief in higher beings is real. It's something that people honestly believe is the truth. So why and how can that evolve through individual selection, if the fitness benefit isn't applied to groups?",1,1583030720,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fbno4b/how_did_religious_belief_evolve_in_humans_and_why/,philosophy,1

fbgzts,DestroGamaDx,The accusation of privilege perpetuates racism/sexism and creates laziness. Society is so hypocritical. Terminology matters but doesnt?,"Privilege seems to always have distain behind it; ""White privilege""/""Male privilege"" likely from people who cant make use of thier own specific characteristics. Ironically privilege indicates some type of NATURAL advantage...something some one wouldnt be able to help or wouldnt try to take away from themselves because life has become quite competitive and its NATURAL. The similarities in hating someone or wanting them to atone for something they cant control is very obviously similar to racism and what spurs on people to do ignorant horrible acts. 

Righteousness is not stoping to another person's level due to morals, this word is seemingly lost in 2020. Righteousness creates ignorance however a lack there of creates hypocrisy...I personally believe hypocrisy is worse as it closes the door on any possibility of change, it becomes personal because you become the reason for these negative results. Ignorance can be fixed and forgiven with how much information and people are in the world. 

Some would argue using terms like ""White/Male Privilege"" is just showing people thier ignorance. That is a lie as it stigmatizes a particular group to try and stop individual cases, if you generalise people (even if you use these terms not meaning to, the term itself tells others to do so that you will never come in contact with) especially in a negative light that is racism plain and simple.

Onto the laziness, I feel my generation is lazy because these terms get nothing done yet people who label others and groups with these terms seem to believe they're helping the world just by saying it. It's like scoffing as if you've solved the issue just by identifying it. 

To end this long...rant off, ignorance will never go away but there are ways to manage it without closing the door on change, hypocrisy creates arrogance which closes the door on change because its embarrassing to not realise you're bashing yourself.

Water can not be control, you can trap it but once that glass cracks and the pressure builds, it will burst and flow uncontrollably until it settles on a stable plain.


Water is freedom. We can't predict what water will do. Water is why America became the most advanced civilization in the shortest time in human history. Let's not allow institutions and the powerful few, trap water. Because one day the pressure will be too much for the glass to hold.

fbchke,CantHOLD23,Reading,"I started getting into philosophy heavily in the last couple of months but since I am trying to read/learn on my own I find it really hard and confusing.
I started reading Nietzsche because a friend recommended that's where I should start. But I am struggling hard because there are a lot of references to some philosophy stuff that I guess I should know to read that book effectively but I just don't.

Sorry for the long intro, my question is how to start getting into philosophy?
I have some general knowledge about it that I picked up in HS and over the years but no real foundations since I graduated International Relations and Diplomacy.

Is it worth reading some other people interpretations of classic books or is it the point for me to read it until I die or understand.

Again I hate sounding like a broken record but I am not here to offend anyone just here to see it though a psychological view point.


The reason there are so many bully’s and school shootings

Bullying Today: Social media has changed the way we bully people instead of a small groups of onlookers watching you as you get your ass beaten by 1 or 2 Kids  or even the whole group. We all know that it is a thing of the past, Today 2020 and beyond we show it off to entire world like on Instagram, Twitter and TicTok imagine knowing theres a video of you getting beaten up while they laugh at you and film it. Then have millions of people commenting on how you’ve been attacked the humiliation must be Next level especially for a child just trying to understand the world. 

School Shootings: I call this Stage 2 as the child matures and survives that mental torture or does not commit suicide the minds becomes more aware of there surroundings possibly causing severe anxiety and Depression, disconnected from people or the opposite sex and then emotional numbness sets in. Once detached from humanity life becomes unimportant you.

favm82,HotSauceInYouA55hole,A philosophy on human connection?,"In general I try to take a Stoical approach in how I approach life, struggle and strife. In evaluating politics or ethics or law, Martha Nussbaum is one of my favorites.

I'm a dedicated introvert and love to think and analyze world news and events. Sharing my life with someone comfortable in these lonesome depths is paramount for me... but I'm a lonely type and developing a personal philosophy for relationships is important. I want to feel with a partner, truly feel and have a connection. So for that, Stoicism is not the answer, though it does come well to help in a breakup or other stressful times in life when endless analysis will only make things worse. (By ""stressful times"" I'm talking about things like long stretches of unemployment or illness).

But I really don't like this disconnect in personal relationships... particularly insofar as dating or romance relationships. I think this hinders rather than harms a relationship. Though I appreciate the work of Beauvoir and Sartre, but I'm not particularly interested in taking an existentialist approach in my own romantic life. 

I think my own philosophy on love and connection has therefore been more along the lines of Judith Butler or Michel Foucault... in fact I've had their quotes inked on my body for some time: [""Justice must always question itself...""](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/117865-justice-must-always-question-itself-just-as-society-can-exist) and [""We're undone by each other. And if we're not, we're missing something.""](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/54041-let-s-face-it-we-re-undone-by-each-other-and-if)

My body used to be a canvas for my pain. I had a bunch of piercings and loved getting inked. This isn't the case anymore, I've long since grown out of marking my body with pain as such, and punishing my psyche as well. But what's on my body still is what I live by: I think a connection cannot be ""real"" in this sense if it can't undo you. (Plus the sex is always lacking something in these situations, though that's not everything it's important.) If you don't feel that spark, why bother? 

What can grow from it if done the right way should be the most fulfilling thing, but there's nothing fair about this type of connection. ""All's fair in love and war"" is reductive and the conflation of these I think causes a lot of pain. Hence the Foucault. Am I being fair to this person in this situation? Is this person being fair to me in this situation? If you're asking the answer is probably ""no"" on all counts. When we are undone by someone and we know we've been wrong, and been wronged, the falling apart happens at the beginning and the end. 

I know these are just buzzy little quotes taken out of their original context, but this is also true for each part of our lives, each ""phase"" or period... and each relationship too. It's all different, we are fluid beings who change with each thing: romantic, platonic or otherwise. Truthfully I don't know if I need a ""philosophy on dating or love"" as such... but it's rather lonely in my brain and someone whose philosophy aligns with this as such is what I'm after in my life partner, aside from other values (a childfree, honest and ecological outlook, among other things.) 

That said, I'm interested in discussing what types of philosophical approaches you all take in relationships/""love,"" if any. Particularly those of you in your 30s.",1,1582900643,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/favm82/a_philosophy_on_human_connection/,philosophy,1

faphn8,SquidIII,"Nature, Specifically Predator-Prey Relationships, Is Immoral and Should Be Stopped (!)","Imagine humans live in a perfect society, every need is met, resources are shared and not competed for. Hard labor is automated leaving time for leisure, art, and culture. Violence is also nonexistent in this future society , and this includes animals. This society believes in animal rights, and given that humans have sufficient ability to maintain those rights, that we should.

Yet in this society, nature as we know it remains intact. Bats eat bugs, cats eat rats, and lions hunt gazelle. But is it fair though for a lion to take the life of that gazelle? They both had similar capacities for thought, both can feel pain, and death by ingestion is extremely gruesome and painful. This is true for most, if not all predator-prey relationships. In current society we do not have the means to eliminate this relationship barring disastrous ecological effects, but in our perfect society we would posses this ability. Should we not eliminate this obvious suffering given the means?

We currently justify this with a circle of life narrative, that plants eat the sun, prey consume vegetation, and that predators eat prey. If one group were to go on strike and refuse to or were unable to fulfill these roles that the entire system would collapse. Predators need to eat prey, because otherwise prey would eat all the plants and everybody would die, and prey need to eat plants because if they didn't they would starve and everybody dies. The only party that wins are plants but plants don't even care. This system, as elegant as it is, is just that: elegant. It has nothing to do with the justice of it, this system exists as it does because it is very good at maintaining and sustaining itself, regardless of the ethics of the situation. And, at this point, one will simply just say that ""this is how it is, and it's pointless to fret about an unsolvable issue"". And I'm forced to somewhat agree, I of course don't know of the specific methods one would use to abolish this relationship. Murdering the big cats in a global Cultural Revolution: Expanded Edition seems counter-productive to my original goals, and neither does the construction of a large zoo type type structure. For one, that seems impractical and even if we were to make several large zoos what would you do with the now uninhabited forestry and nature? With no inhabitant it would quickly over grow, moreover, it seems very likely to me that this land would soon be deforested and developed, which also seems like a non ideal solution. Perhaps using the original land and cordoning the inhabitants into specific zones where hostile species won't interact; regularly feeding predators with a meat substitute, and simultaneously controlling population size via nonviolent means.

But, I of course, am not an expert in the hypothetical field that would exist in the reality that this question is seriously pondered, but I don't think that is important. The inability to solve a problem is no excuse to not investigate it, or ask questions about it.
Maybe we need to recognize the incredible and incalculable pain that it causes, and that perhaps abolition of this system of suffering is ethical.",1,1582866031,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/faphn8/nature_specifically_predatorprey_relationships_is/,philosophy,1

&amp;#x200B;

[The \\""Marx, Locke, Pork Chop\\"" \(This will make sense later, but only sort of\)](https://preview.redd.it/4bx3hhwijgj41.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4bb3fbc2a4b42d210a0d1818bce496c9274c724)

# Marx, Locke, and “Proper Ownership”

Karl Marx and John Locke have very little in common. Marx wrote much of the theoretical basis for Communism, while Locke famously used his argument for the foundational right to private property as the keystone on which to define limits for the extent of civil government. They get to wildly different conclusions about how we ought to organize society, but there is a revealing similarity in the relationship between individuals and their property that they both use as a fundamental assumption of their theory.

Both Marx and Locke thought that the most natural type of ownership came from *being involved in the creation of the good that is owned.*

# Acorns and Property

Locke approaches it this way. Let’s do a thought experiment: there is no government, no state, no laws, etc. and we are in what thinkers from his time call a “state of nature” — which is to say, plopped down on the earth with no pre-existing human society.

You and I live on opposite sides of a meadow, and in that meadow there are acorns. Neither of us really could say we “own” the acorns — they’re just there in the meadow and we both happen to live nearby, gathering acorns, using them as a common good.

Unfortunately, acorns are hard to make edible. They need to be ground, boiled, etc. to be made useful. When we’re both gathering the acorns it’s pretty obvious that they’re fair game. But, if you’ve boiled, ground, and prepared a bunch of acorns to eat and I come over to your side of the meadow and gather up all the acorn flour you spent all day preparing to bring over to my side, *it’s obvious I’m doing something dickish*.

Why?

Well you’ve mixed your labor with the acorns to make them into something different. That new, different value — the acorn flour — is yours. Your mind and your body are yours (we take that as an obvious given), and new value the acorns have as ready food is something that sprang from your mind, and actions you took with your body. The edible acorn paste is *yours* because you participated in its creation, its value is an extension of yourself. The concept Locke creates here is that before money or exchange of value,[ the original and fundamental form of ownership](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/politics/locke/ch05.htm) comes from those who have mixed their labor into the creation of something.

Marx, being Marx, is not using some thought experiment but is assessing the nature of[ workers and their relationship to the fruits of their labour in a capitalist society](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm). Marx wouldn’t use the language of property as Locke does, and instead talks about how the sickness of his early-industrial capital came from alienation. This meant alienation of the worker from his own labour, and from the product of his labour: the worker would rent out his work (renting out his body) to perform repetitive tasks and produce something that he would never be able to afford.

A worker, screwing a bolt over and over again in an assembly line, onto a car he will never be able to buy, experiences a sense of alienation from his labor, the product of his labor, and  (because our own productive labor is so inextricably linked to our human identity and selfhood ) himself. If you spend, instead, 10 hours every Saturday working on building your new gardening shed, that would likely provide much more fulfillment.

I am not here to endorse or defend either political philosophy: instead I want to highlight that (despite coming from opposite ends of the political theory spectrum) both of these imply we ought to have some ownership over the product of labour — that it is a basic and true form of ownership, that the participation of creation in something generates a special relationship to the product.

But let’s flip that on its head and start not from the laborer and whether he should own what he creates, but from the consumer. What does it do to a *consumer* to have had no participation in the act of creation?

# Consumers, Proper Ownership, and Moral Distance

Let’s start with this: there is something different about our relationship to *things we own that we helped to create* and *things that we own that we did not help to create*. While the two above examples are using this concept in high-falootin’ political discourse, I think this is an extremely relatable idea.

If you’ve ever done work on a car, built a gaming desktop for yourself, cooked a meal, or done any kind of project where you’re involved in the creation of something you own, you understand that ***you hold a different relationship to that thing than you do to something you buy***. Maybe you’re more likely to fix it than to throw it out, or more likely to upgrade and improve it than replace it with a newer model and toss out the old. This kind of connection and relationship engendered by participation in the process of making things is what I’ll call “proper ownership”.

It doesn’t even need to be something that was entirely your creation: my business partner bought himself a white jumpsuit and went to a dye-shop to dye it blue. The experience taught him a lot about dyeing, about the effect that has on the environment in large factories, and even about how to look at color. That jumpsuit is his favorite article of clothing — he wears it all the time and I’m sure if it broke he would try to fix it rather than replace it. ***Anecdotally, at least, it seems that the “bad” behaviour of consumerism is less pronounced when the person owning the product is also a participant in its production.***

So why do we behave differently with objects that we just buy from stores? We lack any connection to the process of production, which both makes the object alien to us (we have no personal connection with it, which makes it more disposable), and also allows for “moral distance” between us and the process of production (we don’t know how it was made, and don’t care to ask — it isn’t our business, and we’re just using the final product).

What I mean by “moral distance” is this: let’s say you have two neighbors, both pig farmers. If one neighbor mistreated his pigs egregiously and the other one did not, almost anyone would prefer to give their business to the neighbor who was nice to his pigs. But, we don’t have that kind of closeness with the production of our goods. Instead, we see two pork chops vacuum sealed in a grocery store, side by side. Most people don’t even think about their origin, and it would take work to get an answer. As a result, we might buy pork from the evil pork farmer, helping him stay in business, and leading to more pigs being mistreated. ***Your experience as a consumer is built around receiving the final product with complete separation from the process of production.***

So what is the consequence of “moral distance”?

***Our complete separation from the process of production, as consumers, might be an underlying sickness that diminishes the value we get from our belongings and also leads to negative externalities we would not consciously abide.*** There is a dissonance between what we value and what we support with our purchasing decisions — and the utter separation between our consumptive experience and the production of consumer goods exasperates this. The “moral distance” we have from production results in decisions we wish we didn’t make.

Depending on who you are this could manifest as seemingly innocuous purchases of ground beef at a supermarket that feed a meat industry practicing mass cruelty while damaging the environment, creating superbugs (through the abuse of[ antibiotics](https://www.cornucopia.org/2012/11/resistance-to-important-antibiotic-may-develop-in-soil-study-shows/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA-bjyBRCcARIsAFboWg2HIx1bMNY84qdfbpBTsqVThASpLSUWqCVqV-THFLIstgLZ3jfM0dQaAri0EALw_wcB), for example), etc. , or it could manifest as convenient clothing purchases of fast fashion — supporting an industry that[ produces more carbon emissions than aviation and shipping combined](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035161).

The clothing industry is a particularly good example of this, especially because the disconnection between the consumer and the production leads to sub-optimal product design as well as negative environmental externalities (which I’ve previously posted about[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/dz3en3/why_isnt_clothing_better_than_it_was_30_years_ago/)).

There is a rising understanding of these problems in the mainstream, at least at a superficial level. And that superficial understanding has led to a lot of helpful (if superficial) solutions. In every vein of consumptive goods there have popped up brands whose essential promise is diminishing those negative externalities, whether it be through ethical sourcing, sustainable production, what-have-you.

***Companies that do things like***[ ***make t-shirts out of algae***](https://www.vollebak.com/product/plant-and-algae-t-shirt/)***, are attempting to treat the symptom (negative externalities) without addressing the underlying cause (consumer decisions caused by their separation from design and production)*****.** In many cases, early adopter consumers are willing to use these services — but are almost invariably paying a premium to lower negative externalities. There is, almost universally, either a higher cost for the same utility or a lower utility at the same cost if a good is “ethical.”

But what would happen if we focused on the core of the problem, increasing the connection between consumer and product by involving them in the process of creation? Could a system that encourages more “proper ownership” and eliminates “moral distance” create better outcomes for users as well as reducing negative externalities in production?

# Experimenting With A Lasting Solution

A real, robust solution would require a change in approach that *both involves users more closely in production and creates better value products.* The solution, then, is to increase consumers’ interaction with product design and production decisions: the more interaction consumers can have with design the better suited the product becomes (producing more value for the users) and the less alienation they have from the process of production (producing a greater connection between consumer and product). In practice, this would look like a company primarily focused on ***participatory design: achieving the highest possible bandwidth of communication between the users and the decision makers of production, and iterating on sourcing and design decisions based on user feedback.***

*To put it more concisely, a company who designs clothes* ***with*** *their community not just* ***for*** *their community.*

&amp;#x200B;

[Kind of like this](https://preview.redd.it/hsohkz66kgj41.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63e3d06023cb8f5cae80512bc1871b4e4bd70b20)

This new type of company is possible now (at scale) in a way that it has never been before. In the world of pre-industrialization (Locke), or early industrialization (Marx), there existed no platform where such an information exchange could live — and barriers to creating companies (capital requirements for brick and mortar, limited media avenues for customer acquisition) were much larger.

Now, a clothing brand can be run from a computer with a global production line, a Shopify storefront, and an online portal receiving detailed feedback from every user of the product. Designs can be updated and tweaked in a constant iterative loop with direct feedback from their users, and then updated patterns and tech packs can be sent to factories instantly for the next production order.

The next question is: what platform makes the most sense for this company to live on?

We think the answer is reddit. It is the only platform that is simultaneously:

**-High Bandwidth**: permits long form, nuanced discussion — no constrictive character or size limit and a culture that celebrates long form text posts

**-Multi-directional:** decision makers can talk to consumers, consumers to decision makers, and consumers to each other

**-Multimedia**: video, text, image commingled

**-Transparent:** anyone can come and see the conversations that are happening

And, perhaps most importantly, *some of the important conversations already live here*. For a clothing company, like ourselves, that means rich design discussions from subs like MaleFashionAdvice, sourcing conversations on subs like EthicalFashion, and more.

\------------------------------------------------------

**So, Let’s Try It**

For context: we’re starting a reddit-native community ([r/MeritStore](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeritStore/)) to capture the rich discussions already happening here on design and sourcing, and translate them into real products — making a tangible impact with the valuable thinking from reddit that might otherwise be confined to online discussions. We think this fundamentally different approach to design will both produce superior product design outcomes, and allow deeper sense of connection between user and product (a relationship).

***Making stuff is fun and meaningful, and more people involved in creation and design means more meaning, more fun, and better stuff.***

We’re looking for new testers for product prototypes, feedback on existing products, and people who want to just share their thoughts on clothing design, ethics, sourcing, and features. If you’re interested in this stuff and want your feedback to create actual impact on product decisions, we’d love to have you join the discussion.",1,1582805609,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fab75y/marx_locke_and_how_we_can_use_reddit_to_reduce/,philosophy,1

f9rcfc,GSusschrist,The Essence of Nature," Universal principles of growth and expansion

1. Growth and survival are dependant on interaction

2. Interaction produces awareness of action via feedback

3. Feedback is the change in a space left from an interaction

4. Action requires energy

5. The space that acts and therefore generates energy needs sufficient rest and maintenance to be capable of repeating this action

6. Maintenance is necessary in larger and more complex spaces for enabling effective rest 

&amp;#x200B;

Interaction is communication where principles of language apply

definition of communication: The imparting or exchange of information via a medium

&amp;#x200B;

1. Action is communication between space through feedback

2. Action is the fundamental language of nature (Fundamental: Essential to all other forms of communication)

3. Action manifests in the concept of change (you cannot act without changing something from a previous state)

4. Good, relative to interaction is 'An action of any quality or quantity that increases the potential for further interaction'

5. Bad, relative to interaction is 'An action of any quality or quantity that decreases the potential for further interaction'

Quality being - The number of potential interactions per singular interaction (Like a tree; 1 branch many branches)

Quantity being - the number of potential interactions (Like a tree; every single branch)

6. Languages: All languages are branches of action - sight/smell/hearing-speech/taste/feeling/thought

7. listening and responding to these languages is different from traditional speech of mouth.

8. Awareness of responses, reactions and feedback is listening. Action is speech.

9. Effective communication is the key to solving problems and making life better for and at interaction.

10. The clearer the message and faster the transmission, the more effective and immediate the response.

I use these same principles to develop a clear definition of what this means for health and value.

f9ppnr,saintpetejackboy,Opinion - Life is an alien phenomenon,"If you are of the mind that a chemical soup was struck by lightning to create life, I emplore you to read further. If this was the case, our technology could replicate this event.

Similarly, the singular organism we all share as a common ancestor would fail several steps along the way. DNA and RNA almost function as a type of AI. If you look at your foot, it is very similar to your hand. It was used in a different manner over many years, and the shape reflects that.

So, where does life come from? At best, you can say that life evolved elsewhere and use panspermia to dictate the perfect nature of the ""evolving organism"" that predicated most of life on Earth. This leads back to the same question, however. Where did that come from? How did it start to be?

Given a random string of chance and coincidence, this is not a likely scenario, a perfect AI that adapts and evolves to nearly any circumstances. We may have come from spores, and morphogenetic field theory might one day flesh out, but aside from that, how did this all begin?

I propose that a type of interdimensional interference upon atomic and molecular structures allows life to blossom. An outside force has pushed us to where we are today. You can name it what you want, but if you are only going interstellar or intergalactic, the same problematic question arises: how?

If you move outwards towards interdimensional or other explanations, you have some room to answer, however, you still run against the same issue.

Perhaps how and when and why life exists is not the real question. Those questions look backwards and may never have answers, for good reason. The real solution is looking forward. Why do you exist? How do you exist? When do you exist? You may never be able to answer the initial problem, but going forward, you can construct solutions. As an individual, you can determine why you exist. When you exist and how you exist. That is much more important than trying to rewind to ""The Big Bang"" and ascertain where life came from. Where we came from is not as important of a question as where we are going, in my opinion. 

Life exists, like it or not. Will life keep existing? That is to be determined. However, ever since we were a singular organism floating about in the ocean, we have done one thing, very well: not die. We exist as an entire ecosystem. An entire community. All life has come together to allow us to rocket into space and communicate faster than a blink across the planet. The ultimate goal is to get off this rock and get away from this furnace before something goes catastrophic. We must also remove ourselves from this galaxy and possibly even this universe, if life is to never cease.

We can do this, and this might even be why we exist. Interstellar. Intergalactic. Interdimensional. Interuniversal. All things we may be able to become.

We must be able to become, to continue life. Life has yet to fail, as we know. Why should it fail because our planet, or star, or galaxy or universe does?",1,1582702542,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f9ppnr/opinion_life_is_an_alien_phenomenon/,philosophy,1

f9e54z,polcott,Proof that Wittgenstein is correct about Gödel,"**Proof that Wittgenstein is correct about Gödel**  

When we sum up the results of Gödel's 1931 Incompleteness Theorem by formalizing Wittgenstein’s verbal specification such that this formalization meets Gödel's own sufficiency requirement: “Every epistemological antinomy can likewise be used for a similar undecidability proof.” then we can see that Gödel's famous logic sentence is only unprovable in PA because it is untrue in PA because it specifies the logical equivalence to self contradiction in PA.   
 

**Wittgenstein’s minimal essence of the 1931 Incompleteness Theorem sentence**

“I have constructed a proposition (I will use ‘P’ to designate it) in Russell’s symbolism, and by means of certain definitions and transformations it can be so interpreted that it says ‘P is not provable in Russell’s system’. (Wittgenstein 1956:50e)

**Formalized by Olcott: P ↔ (RS ⊬ P)**

As it turns out to actually be the case the entire body of all conceptual truth is entirely comprised of expressions of language that have been stipulated to have the semantic property of Boolean true (paraphrase of Curry 1977:45) and truth preserving operations applied to this set.  

When these truth preserving operations are defined as finite string transformation rules we establish a bijection such that truth and provability cannot diverge. When we do this we retain all of the original expressiveness of formal systems and screen out semantic paradoxes as ill-formed truth bearers. This allows the universal truth predicate that Tarski proved to not exist to be defined as:  

**Wittgenstein definitions of True() and False()**   

‘True in Russell’s system’ means, as was said: proved in Russell’s system; and ‘false in Russell’s system’ means: the opposite has been proved in Russell’s system. (Wittgenstein 1956:51e) Formalized by Olcott as:  

∀**x (True(RS, x)  := (RS ⊢ x))**		

∀**x (False(RS, x) := (RS ⊢ ¬x))	// LHS := RHS means LHS is defined as the RHS.**  

Since the Wittgenstein-Olcott axiom schema define True(RS, x) as Provable(RS, x) then ¬Provable(RS, x) would be defined as ¬True(RS, x). This means that the Wittgenstein-Olcott minimal essence of the 1931 Incompleteness Theorem &lt;IS&gt; The Liar Paradox.  

**The Formalized Liar Paradox says that P is materially equivalent to Not True.**

**The truth table shows that this is self-contradictory.**  

**P  ↔   ¬True(P) 		P  ↔  RS⊬P**  

**T   F       F 			T   F       F**  

**F   F       T 			F   F       T**    

The truth table of minimal essence of the 1931 Incompleteness theorem is identical to the truth table of the Liar Paradox because the third columns of these truth tables are stipulated by the Wittgenstein-Olcott axiom schema to mean exactly the same thing.  

The failure of logical equivalence shows that both P and ¬P are contradicted (false)  

(in the above formula) thus meeting the \[epistemological antinomy\] sufficiency condition that Gödel stipulated for proof equivalence:

“14 Every epistemological antinomy can likewise be used for a similar undecidability  proof.” (Gödel 1931:40)

The fact that self-contradictory sentences specified in the language of a formal system cannot be proven in that formal system does not make the formal system itself incomplete or inconsistent as long as unprovable (from axioms) is construed as untrue.  

Furthermore that the Gödel sentence can be proved to be unsatisfiable because its satisfaction would derive a contradiction proves that this sentence is unprovable.  

The Gödel sentence is provably unprovable because this proof is one level of indirection away from the original sentence, thus neither self-referential nor self-contradictory:

**(a) “This sentence is not provable” is not true or provable.**

**(b) Provable(“This sentence is not provable”) is true and provable.**

""This sentence is unprovable"" because its satisfaction would be self  contradictory, thus it is provably unsatisfiable thus provably unprovable.   
 

\~Provable(""This sentence is unprovable"") is satisfiable and provable and true because it is not self-referential thus not self-contradictory.   
 

**At the most abstract level of analysis:**  

*Conceptual Truth is ONLY semantic relations between concepts that can always be expressed as\[1\] syntactic relations between finite strings\[2\] thereby logically entailing that truth cannot possibly ever diverge from provability.*

\[1\] Forming a perfect isomorphism between semantic and syntactic relations  
 **∀x (True(x) ≅ Provable(x))**

\[2\] Such as words, word phrases or predicate logic expressions.

**Examples:**  
 ""one"" \[is a\] ""Integer""  
 ""cats"" \[are\] ""Animals""  
 ""cats"" \[have\] ""legs""  
 ""2 + 3"" \[equals\] ""5""  
 ""A ∧ B"" ""↔"" ""B ∧ A""

To make the above abstraction more concrete we focus on the single relation between concepts of \[sound deduction\] from the sound deductive inference model.  

Sound deduction begins with stipulated truth, applies a sequence of truth preserving operations, thus necessarily ends up with truth.

**Truth ONLY comes from:**  
 (1) Stipulated truth (the definitions of the meaning of words)

(2) Applying a sequence of truth preserving operations to stipulated truth.

**Truth ALWAYS comes from:**  
 (1) Stipulated truth (the definitions of the meaning of words)

(2) Applying a sequence of truth preserving operations to stipulated truth.

When we construe a formal systems axioms to essentially be stipulated truth then this same formal systems theorems would also be true because they were derived by applying truth preserving operations to its axioms. Since this is the way that Truth really works we have proven that true can never diverge from provability.

	We begin by postulating a certain non void, definite class {E} of statements, which we  

	call elementary statements...

	The statements of {E} are called elementary statements to distinguish them from other  

	statements which we may form from them or about them in the U language...

	Then the elementary statements which belong to {T} we shall call the elementary theorems  

	of {T}; we also say that these elementary statements are true for {T}. Thus, given {T}, an 	elementary theorem is an elementary statement which is true. A theory is thus a way of  

	picking out from the statements of {E} a certain subclass of true statements…  

	The terminology which has just been used implies that the elementary statements are not  

	such that their truth and falsity are known to us without reference to {T}.

8. I imagine someone asking my advice; he says: ""I have constructed

a proposition (I will use 'P' to designate it) in Russell's symbolism,

and by means of certain definitions and transformations it can be so

interpreted that it says: 'P is not provable in Russell's system'. Must I

not say that this proposition on the one hand is true, and on the other

hand is unprovable? For suppose it were false; then it is true that it is

provable. And that surely cannot be! And if it is proved, then it

is proved that it is not provable. Thus it can only be true, but  

unprovable. ""

Just as we ask: "" 'provable' in what system?"", so we must also ask:

"" 'true' in what system?"" 'True in Russell's system' means, as was

said: proved in Russell's system; and 'false in Russell's system' means:

the opposite has been proved in Russell's system.-Now what does

your ""suppose it is false"" mean? *In the Russell sense* it means 'suppose

the opposite is proved in Russell's system'; *if that is your assumption*,

you will now presumably give up the interpretation that it is unprovable.  

And by 'this interpretation' I understand the translation into

this English sentence.-If you assume that the proposition is provable

in Russell's system, that means it' is true *in the Russell sense*, and the

interpretation ""P is not provable"" again has to be given up. If you

assume that the proposition is true in the Russell sense, *the same* thing

follows. Further: if the proposition is supposed to be false in some

other than the Russell sense, then it does not contradict this for it to

be proved in Russell's system. (What is called ""losing"" in chess may

constitute winning in another game.)",0,1582653240,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f9e54z/proof_that_wittgenstein_is_correct_about_gödel/,philosophy,1

f97zam,qiling,Schrodinger's cat thought experiment is meaningless,"colin leslie dean points out Schrodinger's cat thought experiment is meaningless

is the cat dead or alive

but

what does dead mean? what does alive mean?

Schrodinger does not tell us what dead means what alive means, so just like Godel does not tell us what truth is, his thought experiment is meaningless -just like Godels theorem

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/GODEL5.pdf

Now as dean points out, if some bright spark wants to tell us what according to them, not Schrodinger, dead is what alive is

then

in the process tell us your religion your culture your philosophy your spirituality your science behind what dead is what alive is

and if you go to science for your definition of life

bear in mind we are told by science

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life

""Biology is the science concerned with the study of life.""

but

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life

""There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of life""

so basically

biology science dont even know what life is-how ironic they study life but dont know what life is

that is why biology is not a science

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

Aside dont you think it strange that after say 85 years none of the worlds greatest geniuses have bothered to ask what Schrodinger means by dead means by alive or the geniuses ask does dead mean? what does alive mean? -this is the power of consensus trance

consensus trance

https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Consensus_trance

this meaninglessness of Schrodinger's thought experiment is one proof of the view that all products of human thought end in meaninglessness ie mathematics and science

since

these case studies that that prove mathematics/science end in meaninglessness: prove nihilism:all products of human thought end in meaninglessness by Magister colin leslie dean the only modern Renaissance man with 9 degrees including 4 masters: B,Sc, BA, B.Litt(Hons), MA, B.Litt(Hons), MA, MA (Psychoanalytic studies), Master of Psychoanalytic studies, Grad Cert (Literary studies) : who proved Godels theorems to be invalid

or

https://www.scribd.com/document/35520015/List-of-FREE-Erotic-Poetry-Books-by-Gamahucher-Press

argues all products of human thought end in meaninglessness

examples/case studies

1)Mathematics/science ends in contradiction:an integer=a non-integer

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/All-things-are-possible.pdf

or

https://www.scribd.com/document/324037705/All-Things-Are-Possible-philosophy

2)Mathematics ends in contradiction:6 examples example 1 it is proven 1+1=1

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/MATHEMATICS.pdf

or

https://www.scribd.com/document/40697621/Mathematics-Ends-in-Meaninglessness-ie-self-contradiction

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) it is proven an integer = a non-integer

1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.888... does not stop

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/philosophy/Natural_selection.pdf

""Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant""

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense

You can prove Nihilism is objectively true

Magister colin leslie dean the only modern Renaissance man

HAS SHOWN

First you can prove by logic all products of human thinking end in meaningless

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/All-things-are-possible.pdf

Now natural language is inconsistent “now it is clear from the work of Tarski that the language of everyday speech is” semantically closed” and hence inconsistent”""

thus

""Now with the inconsistency of language all possible views and their negation are now possible""

""Each view contains within it its negation as all views end in meaninglessness""

Second you can then prove using that logic that the logic you use ends in paradox

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/logiccentrismbook.pdf

""Aristotelian logic as an epistemic condition of truth, the grand narrative of western philosophy: logic-centrism, the limitations of Aristotelian logic, the end of Aristotelian logic, logic/essence and language lead to the meaningless of all views""",0,1582624307,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f97zam/schrodingers_cat_thought_experiment_is_meaningless/,philosophy,1

f8queg,neilmorris2222,Get To Know More About Craps And Baccarat,"**Craps** 

In the event that you don't care for the vibes of the roulette table, you'll loathe the craps table. Not exclusively are craps tables typically loaded up with energized and noisy players, the wagering alternatives resemble an unknown dialect. 

You can put down craps wagers on many conceivable outcomes. 

Be that as it may, here's the uplifting news: 

* You just need to realize how to put down two wagers to get in the activity and diminish the house edge as low as could be allowed. 
* Just put down a wager on the don't pass line or the pass line. 

The best wager at the craps table is the don't pass line, followed intently by the pass line. The edge is marginally under 1.4% for the don't disregard and somewhat 1.4% for the pass line. You should take the full chances wager after either wager to diminish the house edge considerably more. Overlook the entirety of different wagers offered on the table - none of them offer chances in the same class as these. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](ymk8t4ifdvi41)

At the point when you wager on the pass line, if the roll is a 7 or a 11, you win even cash on your wager. In the event that the roll is a 2, 3, or 12 you lose your wager. In the event that some other number is moved it sets a point, and the shooter keeps on rolling the bones. 

At the point when the fact of the matter is moved before a 7, you win your wager. On the off chance that a 7 is moved before the point number is moved, you lose your wager. 

A don't pass wager is the inverse. On the off chance that the shooter rolls a 7 or 11, you lose your wager. At the point when a 2 or 3 is moved, you win. A move of 12 outcomes in a tie. Each and every other number sets a point. On the off chance that a point is set and the shooter rolls a 7 preceding rolling the point, you win. In the event that the fact of the matter is moved once more, you lose. 

Most players in [online slots Canada](https://www.secureonlinecasino.ca/online-slots/) play the pass line wager since they feel like you're neutralizing different players in the event that you play the don't pass line. The distinction in rates is little, so you don't surrender much by playing the pass line, yet it's marginally more terrible than the don't pass bet. 

Craps is perhaps the best game in the gambling club, yet just in case you're into fervor. In case you're searching for a more quiet or increasingly singular game, stay with roulette, spaces, or video poker. 

**Baccarat** 

* Baccarat joins a low house edge without contemplating technique. 

Your solitary choices are the amount to wager and whether to wager on the financier, player, or a tie. The seller deals with everything else. 

The best wager on the baccarat table is on the financier, offering a house edge of simply over 1%. The player wager is marginally higher, however the tie wager is so high you ought to never take it. The tie wager has a house edge of 9 to 14% contingent upon the payouts—which changes from club to gambling club. 

In the event that you need a simple to play game that offers a low house edge you should discover a baccarat table. It plays as effectively as opening machines and offers a much lower edge. Space machines quite often offer an opportunity at a more significant salary out, so you have to choose in the event that you need to play longer or get an opportunity at a greater success. 

Most baccarat games are played for high stakes, yet on the off chance that you can locate a smaller than usual baccarat game, you can appreciate a similar game for lower stakes.",0,1582549090,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f8queg/get_to_know_more_about_craps_and_baccarat/,philosophy,1

How intelligent is the average cell?

Why do we take such an egocentric perspective of ourselves?  Why do we think we are so intelligent and autonomously conscious?

What if our solar system is just like what we call a molecule, one of trillions..  

What if each one of us were like that one single cell in ""our"" brain.. Totally oblivious to the greater reality of which we are all simply, parts, of a whole.

What if the universe was conscious, cosmically more complex and far far beyond the ability of even the entirety of every brain and consciousness on earth perfectly united and harmonised as one entity?

What if you are just a humble part, of a part, of part, that altogether makes up ""earth,"" which is just a part, of a part, of a part, of a galaxy, that is --mysteriously to us-- all interconnected, every galaxy, functioning together, yielding one conscious universe?

You would never know..  You are too small, you could never know..

Just imagine, the cells ""your body"" was composed of 7 years ago are entirely different than the current cells of which your body is composed of.
Meaning, its highly probable that cells currently in your body were once apart of at least another body, if not many others.  Erasing the lines of demarcation we're particularly fond of, our individual ""birth and death,"" *we* have managed to come very far.

f8jsei,bigslendy,The balance of the world.,"First off I would like to say my philosophy teacher completely rejected my paper because ""there's no real conclusion."" My question is how the hell is a 19-year-old college student supposed to fucking know everything about the universe? We don't even know what happens after we die so how are we supposed to know how the universe works? Fuck the system we live in.

The balance of the world.

There isn’t just one side to everything. There are multiple sides to everything. Balance for everything. Our daily conversation has so many energies involved with it. Compatibilism is balance between everything in the universe. Free will is what turn you take, and determinism is how bumpy the road is or how balanced your life will be because of the choices you make. This is not proof of compatibilism; this is simply my reality. 

Compatibilism is when you believe everything you do in life was already predetermined by the universe and you also have a sense of choice in the matter of everything you do. Determinism is simply the matter of everything you do was already predetermined by the universe and that you’re always on the right path because it was already predetermined for you. Free will is living life as if you’re the decider of your own fate. Your choices will create the outcome. 

So how exactly are we able to balance both determinism and free will together? You start by making a question. “What should I eat tonight?” and “should I go out tonight?” Are some good examples. There can be multiple answers and always will be. The choice you make is entirely up to you in the moment. The universe won’t decide it for you, because you’re the one that’s currently living in the moment!

You take it upon yourself to go to the restaurant you desired. A new question pops into your head. “If it was already set in stone that I would go to burger king, do I even have a choice in the matter?” Yes. Yes, you do. See that’s the beauty of free will. If it was already predetermined that you went to burger king then you were the one to make it the right choice by going to the determined location. You have free will in everything that happens in your life. You cannot control what happens to you but you get to control how you deal with it. 

You get sad. You have a bad depression phase; everything seems like its sitting still. It’s almost as if nothing feels real at all. You don’t know yourself and its hard to get back up on your feet. You feel as if you have *no control*. We don’t even know it, but sometimes our problems aren’t even problems at all. 

Your problems aren’t real. If you decide to make it a problem, then it becomes a problem. Your brain is making you see a hallucination that isn’t even real. Life is real, its our problems deep down within our brain that make it feel like its not real. You have the choice in the matter of whether it becomes a problem or if it doesn’t. 

I’m the creator of my own reality. Want to know why? Reality isn’t real. Our brain makes our reality. Reality is what your brain makes of it. Reality cannot be put into words, because you’re the only one who knows *your reality*. You are the universe. A small part of it. Were such a small part of the universe that our problems **LITERALLY** *don’t matter.* 

Let’s get back to what I said earlier on balance. Balance is in everything you do. There is an energy associated with everything you say and do. It's everywhere. In my world finding a balance is what makes me so strong. The college culture is very out of balance. From what I’ve noticed and experienced is that young students are already resorting to alcoholism and drugs to escape the harsh realities of the real world. It’s a true heart breaker to see everyone and everything fall apart around you and all you can think you can do is sit and watch the world burn. 

What if you could be that change? What if you started to balance when you get out of your mind to let loose? That’s where I’m currently at. Balance has made me really see what’s real and what’s not. There’s a very negative energy that comes with binge drinking and drugs. It got to a point in my first semester where I started to realize I wasn’t the one binge drinking alcohol and smoking pot every day; The alcohol was consuming me, and the pot was smoking me. 

What made me realize this was a very profound psychedelic experience that made me see the true nature of everything. Not just in my world, but everyone’s world. Were so focused on what’s right in the present and not looking forward to our futures nearly at all. For a bit during the experience I completely lost who I was. I didn’t know myself. The further I went down into the abyss, the more lost I became. Eventually I came to the realization I haven’t been myself the whole-time during college. I’ve been prioritizing how I felt and wasn’t putting any real work or effort in. The abyss was me. I had become empty and the only thing that could fill it was the false sense of love from drugs. 

It was time for a big change. I started to really put in the work and results came to me. I was able to recognize the signs of the universe that I would be missing every single second I was alive. I felt alive. One with myself in the universe. It was time I had to start balancing my energies. I would start to drink only 3 days a week and put in work for the 4 days. That was going well for a while until it hit me. 

Why not do more? Why not live more and drink and smoke less? This was going to be one of the most difficult adjustments of my life. It was hard, but I kept going. I got a job finally. I limited myself to one day a week where even then I would put a limit on myself. I would only enjoy myself at parties if I moderated myself. That balance within yourself is key. Sometimes I went overboard, and I would completely regret everything I did the night before. It was time for even more change. 

Today I am able to limit myself almost completely. I still have a lot of progress to make for myself and I look forward to every day. Every new day that begins is a new day to succeed. Im constantly looking for ways to improve. Sometimes I degrade. We all do but at the end of the day we have to keep pushing. Constantly questioning and accepting everything around me has given me a new perspective to live by. I live without regrets. I cant go and change the past but I can change how I will be for today and the future. I live for myself and everyone close to me. Life is great, with balance I can control what I do with my life. Even if life has no meaning, I still have attached meaning to my life. We all fall apart sometimes. Some people fall apart more than others. Some people follow the path the universe has bestowed upon you and some people don’t. That’s the way life goes. 

Back to compatibilism. How can you possibly think we have no choice in anything you do? What would be the point of life if you didn’t attach meaning to it? Is there really one path? Nobody knows. Absolutely nobody. None of knows until we die, and we don’t even know what happens after death. Do we even know anything at all? I don’t know. That’s one thing I know.

Compatibilism is really what gives my life meaning. I know that one day ill end up 6 feet deep in my grave. We all die, there no escape from that. So why care so much about the little things when we all end up the same? Compatibilism gives me the free will to do as I please and know everything will be okay when I die. I’m ok with death. Honestly, I’ve almost become friends with it. I’m excited to die, but that doesn’t mean I don’t live my life happily and truly. The reason why I look forward to death is because I look forward to what the future will become. I have hope that one day everyone can and will be happy. Life is only what we make of it right now. Why don’t we push ourselves to be a better person every day?

There’s a balance with everything. Compatibilism is that balance. Your inner balance is determined by the choices you make. Your choices have outcome and your balance reflects your choices. Having free will is very dangerous, but if used correctly it can make your life balance even more stable. Determinism is the long road of life you go down every single moment. 

If our lives were predetermined with no free will or choice, why do our choices matter? Our choices literally have matter. Our choices emit energy, which is matter. With our free will, we can determine the outcome of our lives.",1,1582508983,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f8jsei/the_balance_of_the_world/,philosophy,1

As I grew older I began to realise that magic was not real and it's all just an illusion. Psychologically these affected me to ask the question about the biggest influential magical figure that is yet to be proved to me as not an illusion, God. 
I get told it's bad to swear, bad to steal, bad to kill, bad to plenty of other things I now see as an adult that is literally running the world. 
Governmental figures swearing, Tax inflation, greedy profit, war, Voilent Content, Vanity, I'm sure you can name a lot more. 

Going back to controversy, this psychological warfare creates confusion, and confusion creates fear; with fear this leads to conform. This is exactly where technology and drugs (oh drugs are also bad) start to work in harmony with convenience and compliance creating a society that becomes so helpless and confused that the only thing left to do is just go home and watch TV, browsing and voice your opinion like it matters on social media, work and pay tax, being stuck in an infinite loop while being programmed with an incresing rate of anxiety and depression; and finally hope that someone or something else is going to fix the issue.
At this point this starts to lead to desperate actions and doubt of self value. We are all on the verge of giving up, we need change. We need to beat the system.

In 2017 I decided to take on the challenge to be the one that can contribute to solving part of these issues spreading the awareness by setting an example (I talk more about this on my social media @rhyseeding). I trademarked FUQIT to prove I can play ball with the system and point out the controversy why saying it is an issue. I mean if someone wants to argue with the fact this is an issue but can find it totally acceptable that a president can say grab her by the pussy on national tv - we are not the same. 
I want FUQIT to have the recognition as the symbol of change that leads society to taking actions on these issues. 

So to start FUQIT as an instrument of change, I am creating a new mobile platform.

Uber takes 23% on driver fares, LYFT takes 20%. On a basic measurement of 1 fare per hour on an average of $25 they take between $5-$5.75. Drivers are now on an average of $19 per hour. Then Pay taxes, wear and tear to their vehicle, gasoline and insurance.
 
I want to make change to the working class where working is an option that's worth it, not having to work to only scrape by on the bare necessities.
 
Another issue that we see today is the social structure of nightlife in general. When residents live in rural areas and want to have a drink in the city they have to take consideration of how they are getting there, the price of transport, price of drinks, arranging to get home, or even last minute deciding to want to drink but parking is more expensive or the hassle of arranging transport in the early hours of the morning. Bars and Clubs and even our own government don't do anything to discourage drink driving apart from advertising campaigns and dishing out charges.
 
""FUQIT Book a Taxi"" will charge extremely low rates to the driver's fares and sponsor bars, clubs, venues within the app to show users where they can leave their car overnight in one of our verified properties for free. Users will look out for our flyer ""FUQIT have a Beer"" Scan the QR Code within our app and we will pick you up at your location, cover the parking and the free ride in the morning to pick you up. We even cover the expense to the drivers too. 
 
This Model isn't about profit. It's about change.

I'll create more posts on reddit about the next move I make with FUQIT. I have started a GoFundMe for this and anyone's help will be greatly appreciated to contribute towards the change. I'll drop the link below and other links on the trademark in general.

With or without the money I will be pushing for this because of how passionate I believe in this. 

Feel free to get in touch with me. I'd love to get more people involved!

f89hp9,Gibberroth,The Divided Brain and the Western World,"Hello everyone. I am here to ask for some help regarding the work of Iain McGilchrist. I am making a post as I believe his ideas are of profound importance to our modern world, and I think many of the themes of his work are partially philosophical. I would appreciate any and all thoughts / feedback / criticism of his hypothesis, as I believe it has the potential to make a substantial difference to our world, and our future. I do want to say that I am not affiliated with him economically or otherwise, but that his ideas really do speak to me on a substantive level, and I hope they do for you as well.

McGilchrist's central thesis (please forgive my butchering of a summary, as I did not want this post to be longer) relates to the two hemispheres of the human brain. He asks the question as to why an organ which has the sole purpose of making connections is divided into two, and believes this ""design"" relates to our competing needs, and the two foms of attention we use to meet those needs. For example, imagine a wild animal is searching for food. In order for it to separate seed from pebble, or to capture prey, it must have a focused, precise, narrow form of attention to be successful. But, if all of its attention is devoted to getting lunch, it will very soon become someone else's!

This is because it must simultaneously have an open attention, as wide as possible. It must have an awareness for everything else that exists in its periphery. It must be aware of other entities, be they friends, mates, or foes. Evidence demonstrates in animals that it is the left hemisphere that is largely responsible for the focused attention necessary to gather food, and it is the right hemisphere which we need to have a broad awareness of everything else. In short, the left hemisphere focuses on a single part, while the right takes into account the bigger picture, the ""whole"" of experience.

McGilchrist believes these two forms of attention in fact create two different versions of the world. On one hand, we have the context, or the world, of 'me' - just me and my needs, an individual competing with other individuals. My ability to peck that seed, chase that rabbit, or grab that fruit. I need to use, or to manipulate, the world for my ends. It is the left hemisphere's narrow form of attention which we need to do this, to focus on a single thing.

On the other hand, I also need to see myself in the broader context of the world at large, in relation to other beings around me. I need to see myself as a member of my social group, to see potential allies, mates, and enemies. Here, I could feel myself to be connected to something much bigger than myself. The flight or flock with which I roam, the pack with which I hunt, the mate and offspring I must also feed and take care of, and everything else in my purview. For this, a broad, open attention to whatever exists is necessary, and this is provided by the right hemisphere. These two forms of attention are blended together so seamlessly, that they are imperceptible.

McGilchrist goes further, and argues that these two hemispheres have very different dispositions towards the world and its inhabitants, and I've tried to summarize the key differences here.

We utilise the right hemisphere in order to understand, as provided by its broad, open form of attention. It plays a vital role in our capacity to empathise with one another, to bond socially, to read human faces, understand gesture and other forms of implicit communication such as tone of voice. It appreciates uniqueness, rather than general categories. It is the right hemisphere that has a preference for the living, for the natural world, which it has a relationship with.

The left hemisphere is primarily involved in manpulation. We grasp things with our right hand, connected to our left hemisphere. We use it to make tools, to categorize. In most people, it is where language is stored, and language, in many ways, gives us tremendous power. The left hemisphere allows us to make and operate machinery, and without it even hammering a nail can be impossible.

The key ""purpose"" of the right hemisphere is connection, while the left's is to manipulate, and have power over its surroundings. While both hemispheres are vital to our survival, McGilchrist argues that the left hemisphere's ""version"" of reality has become predominant in our modern world, leading to a world lacking in empathy, mechanically oriented, and obsessed with control. All the while, the right hemisphere's capacity for empathy, trust, compassion and attraction to the natural world have been inhibited.

When we look at the real world events today, be it warfare, the destruction of the natural world, the need for total power and control (all of which could lead to the collapse of our civilizations), I cannot help but feel that all of these are strongly linked with the hypothesis McGilchrist provides.

McGilchrist also believes that if we address this imbalance, we could have the opportunity to create a better world, one where the values of the right hemispheres are allowed to be primary, and I believe this could help us immensely with the many issues we face as a society and as a species. The reason why I am sharing this information, is because it is something that I deeply believe in. I've looked at the evidence, and I'm convinced, and it has given me hope that if people work together, we can solve this. As a child, I remember distinctly the horror I felt, seeing pictures of the Holocaust - seeing the faces ofhuman beings who had done nothing to deserve the experimentation, torture and murder that ocurred with such virulence. We can see similarities in Nanking, Hiroshima, or the modern day uncountable cruelties that occur. How could this have happened, and why does it continue to occur? But, as worn down as these events can make us, it was seeing the opposite that gave me some hope. Learning about, for instance, the renaissance, period of romanticism, the civil rights movement, the 70s peace movement. It seemed as if these events, these moments in time represented two very different ways of viewing the world, of existing, even.

In one, there is a clear lack of compassion and human connection. Human beings, in a way, become ""objectified"". Reduced to automatons, to be utilised (exploited) in whatever way is deemed fit. There is an obsession with utility, material goods, industrial and technological advancement. The primary purpose becomes power, for its own sake.

This is contrasted starkly by the other events I referred to. In these periods, it is not power that is the motive, it seems, but human connection. There is an understanding of the fundamental qualities that humans share, regardless of group. There is a realization that this individual infront of me is a human being, just like myself, and I should treat them in the way that I would be treated. 

In many ways, I think these contrasting events indicate which hemisphere is ""primary"" at any point in time. By no means am I suggesting that these events can be entirely explained by differences in the hemispheres, but I do think that there could be a strong link. McGilchrist argues that although there have been periods throughout history where both hemispheres flourished together, he believes that we have moved more and more to the world of the left.

More than anything, I want to see a world in which human beings are able to live together peacefully - where we do not have to worry about environmental devastation or warfare, and I believe that is the right hemisphere's abilities that will allow us to do that.

If anyone is interested in looking into this further, Ive listed two links below, a ten minute animation and a half an hour talk. As I said previously, any feedback is greatly appreciated.

f886mk,sjael_,"I wanted to share thoughts on whether or not a god or something similar enough to be called a god does or could exist, mostly though I’m just curious to see what people think of my thoughts so I can maybe get another’s perspective or theory on the concept so I can expand my own","I apologise in advance for the length of this but I did want to say what I think of it not really to answer anything or ask anything but more simply to share for curiosity’s sake 🙃

I’m not basing these ideas on anything more than opinion really just based on the entirety of this concept as I understand it so take no offence if I’m wrong on any particular matter as I do not intend any. This is all just to hopefully see from other people’s points of view 😊


I personally believe it’s more than a little unrealistic to assume that if a god where to exist that it would be bound to any law we know of, what I mean to say is if yes a god did exist who’s to say that he has limits to what it can change create or know. If as some cultures believe he is immortal and infallible then it should be assumed that he perceives the passage of time so differently from us that we cannot understand it without being such a being nor he understand our perception of time, it would I should think be as alien to him as his is to us.
something I think however is more important than just those things is for example with such power it is likely that it his mind is infinitely more complex than we could either ever achieve or come to understand so in that way he will likely understand foresee and act in a way that is unfathomable to us, think of it this way, could you to something with so limited a consciousness as an ant for example explain the way our universe works as far as we know it to? Could you teach it how the laws of physics as we know them work and how they act upon everything on our world? 
the point im trying to make is the ant has a lifespan so short in comparison to us that it doesn’t even at its most generous span live long enough to get started on such things let alone understand them. An ants mind has its limits as do ours, his are like a framework. It gives it recognition of what it must do (gather food eat sleep etc) and avoid (danger weather conditions etc) where we can comfortably wonder what else there is and how vast a mind can be so why on earth would it be any easier for a god to speak to us? Would we even know if it was? Perhaps the nature of its existence is so alien to our senses that we cannot even detect his attempts at communicating or it may exist outside of all that we know and if that were the case why would it make sense for us to know of it? Surely if we are a product of our reality of this universe then our very existence would be bound by its rules, anything from outside it would I’m assuming be so inconceivable and counter to the fabric of our plain of existence that if it spoke to us those words might shatter our mind not by any means to say it is intended but that if ours are bodies meant for this level of reality (Assuming there’s are in fact more) then another’s that does not abide by its rules may have devastating consequences for the mind.
besides even that there is the idea that should a being be this powerful and everlasting then by our understanding of a mind it would be a thing of utter insanity, not because it intended to be or was created to be or anything like that simply because of the nature of its existence. Having all time to think and to do and all the means to do them while simultaneously having nobody to share you experiences or your time with and no equal. Such a thing as far as for humans would be maddening so if we base it on our own mind then it can only be madness without logic reason or empathy, simply emotional responses as outbursts and things only a god could express. So to me if a god did exists without limits to it, it would either be the cumulative insanity of all things given a mind or it would not truly be a god, because if it does exist under limits then it is no god but rather a mind so advanced beyond our own that it seems as if it was a god as it would surely exhibited godlike powers and calling it one would be no stretching of reason but if it has limits then it is only a being with less limits than us, a thing so far past what we can imagine or understand that it can do or change things we do not believe to be possible to influence and if that were so then who’s to say we could not given time find ourselves in their shoes. If they experience time differently to us then does that mean they even know how or if they evolved to be that way, surely if a thing was once similar to us in the way we experience time then once they reach a level where time no longer has sway on them then might they no longer recognise what they had been before. 
none of our thoughts on it will likely ever hold true that is fact funny as it is, the only thing that I can say is none of the ideas are impossible some certainly I think are more likely than others but to say that something is definitely this or that is a lie. The one constant in science is that we will never truly understand nor know all there is to know about anything, say for example I told you I knew everything to know about physics and for all our measures and instruments telling us that’s true it is not. Our universe so far as can be known is endless and has been theorised to have an outside which could have anything and to say that physics is known when we know nothing of what lies outside of that can influence it or if even physics is not being misunderstood or misinterpreted is a possibility, because we know already that our data on things is changed by our very observation of them so who’s to say we haven’t corrupted everything we’ve learned or are even capable or observing all things that relate to it. Anyway my whole point is that we can only consider and conceive of things within the limits of our mind of what we know already or can know so it is logical to assume that we have missed a hell of a lot and maybe can never know of everything with the nature of our minds taken into account, at least for now. I still hold the hope that one day we will have evolved so far that the idea of us being so advanced that we are the ones being thought of as gods is not a strange and silly thought.",1,1582456343,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f886mk/i_wanted_to_share_thoughts_on_whether_or_not_a/,philosophy,1

Ahem

Is being a materialist the ultimate cuckoldry?

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than materialism. Honestly, think about it supra-intellectually. You spend your life working, building up a “career”, indulging your desires and making offspring for at least 90 years, if you’re lucky, solely so you can go and get ravaged by permanent non existence upon your inevitable death. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little “life”- university education, physical fitness, raising children, saving up for retirement, advancing in your field of work. All of it has one simple result: your body is more enjoyable for the maggots and worms that will eventually fill you full of fetid holes.

Developed the perfect physique? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random incinerator that will burn you to a crisp in order to keep the maggots at bay. Otherwise the maggots and the insectoid scum get to fuck your rotting corpse every which way. They get the benefits of every ounce of muscle you built up, all that sweet fatty brain tissue you built up with your “literary hobby”, and that juicy fat from your succulent first-worlder diet.
As a man who is a materialist, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 90 years of your life simply to feed worms. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically.",1,1582455257,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f880z0/is_being_a_materialist_the_ultimate_cuckoldry/,philosophy,1

I am not Religious.
TLDR: Because of the Burden Of Proof.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)

However, I've been reading about Jesus lately, and that dude was on point!

Here are some quotes: (Pick and choose your favourites, that is important!)

I once heard a story about a mad man. He had written scribbles on a thousand parchments, some were lost to a fire thousands of years ago. Scholars went through these demented deliberations and found little use. However, hundreds years later, scholars of the time went through them again. And in the midst of incoherency and lunacy they found sentences. Some were interesting. Some were fascinating and some.. Just some.. Were illuminating.

To some, I may be rude. To some, I may make sense. Just like the scribbles of the story above. The point I am trying to make in this particular text is that I found some good nuggets of wisdom in what was written about My Man Jesus!

As an Atheist, it is important to find good knowledge, where we can find it.

The new testament and the stories about Jesus are intriguing!

If you look beyond the stuff about God and Me being the only truth and so on..

SOME of the stuff Jesus preached is actually pretty good.

There is a long tradition of cherry-picking from the Bible what may suit us.

I've found some pretty good stuff myself.

Here are some fav quotes from the JC himself:

""Do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day's own trouble be sufficient for the day.""

I like this. Live in the moment. Let go of yesterday and tomorrow.

If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.

Ooooh, This is a good one! Give all you have to the poor. - Powerfull.

A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.

There is no arguing that one.

I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.

This one is popular among the common folk. I think I get it!

----

The point is.. Jesus had some good qoutable stuff to recite. As an Atheist, I like Jesus. He had the balls to say some grade A poetry.

I do not know if this is unpopular or not.
I'm guessing it is controversial, perhaps?

Anyway, I urge you godless SOB's to read some Jesus. Some of it is kind of good!

f80scm,F-I-Z-Z-Y,"""Right or Wrong Morals""","The basis of morals and ""right or wrong"" is many people's decisions on what a society should be like based on conscience. Usually things like this are laws and overall morals. There are no set morals though, showing that no matter what you believe to be good or bad, it is true in it's own right. Our society and laws show that if someone has a opposite sense of morals they diagnose them as a sociopath. Saying they don't have a conscience because their beliefs of right or wrong is different. Obviously a lot of what these morals show are helpful to creating a society, such as laws like ""no murder,"" but is there anything wrong with murder or what are considered ""heinous acts"" in a world without society? That answer would be yes and no, based on what your believes or philosophies are.  So, really all i'm saying is there is no right or wrong, no good or bad, no evil or justice, just a ""choosing area"" all decided by our conscience.",1,1582413886,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f80scm/right_or_wrong_morals/,philosophy,1

An article for documenting the understanding of existence

***It (the inanimate)***

***They***

***We***

***You*** 

***I (closely intimate)***

***The greater***

Existence is loosely defined as having a state of living. It can also be interpreted as having objective reality. I constructed those last two sentences using the help of an existence definition that I found through a dictionary. I personally do not claim to have any form of substantial understanding of the human brain or psychology. While I may have a fair amount of knowledge of the subjects involved, no one can know all. That Is feel while having a deeper understanding of the aforementioned topics can help with wrapping one’s head around a certain situation, it can have the side effect of clouding and simplifying the understanding of the we. That is to say looking in too much detail, even broadly, can mean the blurred edges of the abstract picture become too well defined to notice the whole thing. I must make it clear that this is not saying that the study of such areas is bad, rather this article is from a differently defined perspective. There are many perfectly valid arguments to go against mine if the writing was to be intentionally done from another perspective. That sounded horrifically pedantic but is annoyingly necessary. My message is simply that, mine. Do with it as you wish, I do not force any perspective onto you, rather invite you to explore. This is done with the hope that you will gain a better understanding of yourself and the others around, as well as the ‘universe’ that encompasses it all. 

The first section if would like to look at is the “it”, that is the interactions humans have with physical objects that do not contain a conscience. Whether or not certain animals contain a consciousness is heavily debated and unclear. For the purposes of this article I feel safe with defining a very grey cut-off of if the being has a ‘brain’. So, for example, a chair would not be conscious, but a spider would be. It is very difficult to know to what (and if) the extent the spider is aware of its existence. Humans interact with the it in a mostly physical sense, the 5 senses mainly. These physical senses can trigger certain more emotional responses. When listening to a certain piece of music, or walking through and sensing your childhood town, links feel as though they are made in the brain. These make you feel certain emotions, or mixtures of chemicals in the brain. Why precisely they do this is surely beyond me, but the very fact that they do suggests a tangible link between the physical ‘it’ and the emotions. We rely on the ‘it’ to define the world in which we live. The ‘it’ is the ground we walk on. On this planet it is innately non-living in nature, who knows if this is a common theme within the universe.

I fell everyone can understand what the ‘they’ is. You look upon a field and see many people playing a particular game, you would refer to them as ‘they’. They play the game well, or they play the game badly, perhaps you are referring to a particular side, one which you support or detest. ‘They’ seems to be normally used as an understanding of a group of people, but from a third person. You yourself would not be involved in the group. ‘They’ can reflect many feelings. It is extremely flexible. There is some debate as to how the ‘they’ would come about. In my conversations with others and with myself I have heard many times the argument that others are completely different to the ‘self’, that is you, the reader. It seems possible that existence orbits and relies solely on the person who is reading this, you. I could say that I believe, as the writer, that everything may exist around me, and I am the only truly sentient being in this universe. The ‘they’ exists as a separate body and entity from myself, but can I truly know them, are they truly real? As someone who is not me, you must make this decision for yourself. I believe that you are certain that you are ‘real’, but can you be certain that I, and others, are real? If you are not sure if you are real, the question continues. This is the most interesting part for me…

The ‘We’ is a tremendous saying and idea. It connects you as a being to others, as a potentially equal being. It implies a true and real connection between these beings, one which you may believe to be complete. Every being has their own and completely justifiable interpretation of this, and it would be unwise to assume that these beliefs are incorrect. I wish to present an overarching view of this. To fully believe in a ‘we’ is to accept that other beings are fully equal to oneself (as suggested before). Sometimes when talking about a ‘we’ I have seen that it some people use it, even though they may not fully believe that the others are truly real. This suggests that there are many people who would choose that others are not fully true, perhaps as a default? I invite you to think, when you state something as a ‘we’ what do you *truly* think about the other members of this group?

Me. I. The *writer.* I am little more that the guide to help you, the real star, onto understanding yourself and what you really are. The true purpose of this paper is for *you* to truly think. Think about yourself completely. Think about others completely. Think about your place in it all.

You. The reader. The listener. You must be interpreting this somehow, how do you truly feel right now? Emotions are so incredibly elastic; it is amazing how they can make us feel. Some people feel one way, you may feel another. That is the incredible diversity of human nature, there are so many beautiful variables, it is more than anyone could count. I know that emotions are truly little more than neurophysiological changes, but as a person, as a *human being,* those must be and are interpreted. Everyone has a natural way of interpreting these emotions, and that is what truly defines how they feel. I, and everyone who surrounds *you*, interprets those feelings. I would suggest that if they are a true ‘friend’, they would not only interpret them, but understand and be able to respond to them. This is just my interpretation of course, and I would suggest that you form your own opinion in whatever way you wish.

The English language restricts me here of course, and I encourage you to form your own feelings irrespective of the way it is presented to you. True feelings transcend the language barrier.

Falling down is not a failure, failure comes where you stay where you have fallen.

f7lbrf,stan0904,"Life may have a purpose, after all...","My mom passed away just a few days before Christmas in 1966. I was about 9 years old.

I couldn't understand why a loving God would allow innocent people (especially innocent children) to suffer for no apparent reason. All my life, up to about age 55 I just couldn't come up with a reason. Neither could anyone else.

People would say the our goal is to become loving and caring about other people. But how did suffering fit in. It still seemed that God should not allow suffering because there was no reason for it.

Then I realized something: After my mom died, I had more empathy for other people who lost a loved one. That included war, poverty, etc.

So (I thought) maybe ""God"" allows us to suffer because it's the only way for us to learn empathy/compassion/love for others. If we had compassion, wouldn't we try to end suffering and treat each other according to The Golden Rule? ""Do unto others, as you would have done to yourself.

That is the meaning of empathy.

Let me take this philosophy  a little farther and explain where I believe we came from and what our goal is...

My personal belief is that we started on a higher realm and intentionally ""fell"" into physical reality to experience separation from ""Cosmic Consciousness / All that is / The Matrix / The source field or whatever you want to call it.

After separation, we needed to learn empathy. The only way to do this is from experiencing suffering.

So we would feel compelled to treat others as we treat ourselves.

We likely learned compassion over many incarnations as humans but we may have first incarnated as animals. Animals have instinct (a connection to the Source Field hive mentality) that humans don't have much of.

So, what is the ""end game"" here.

I would speculate that after we have enough compassion, we ascend to a realm where our desires manifest as in a Lucid Dream.

Without compassion, we would be like bulls in a China shop with our incredible new powers of instant manifestation.

OK, this is just my own personal explanation of why things are the way they are and I understand that while we are suffering, it's almost impossible to see any purpose for suffering.

I believe that many people took the accelerated class in order to evolve spiritually and bit off more than they could chew. Looking down from the higher realms, we didn't know how hard this life would be.

A am sharing this to help other people understand why we live in this ""School of Hard Knocks"" and that we may have intentionally volunteered to be here to evolve spiritually.

Most people believe that our primary goal in life is to learn to love others. But they are vague on how this actually happens.

Many people will say that you just have to be more loving.

I wish it were that easy.

I've come across the following idea several times lately and I'm interested in learning a bit more about it. I don't know which philosophers / do-gooders out there have coined it but its come up so often lately I imagine someone must have considered or philosophised about it...

The concept is that of making the world a better place by doing good around you. If we postulate that everything we do exists in this universal pool of that which is good and that which isn't, then we have the power in every moment to add 'good' to that pool. In this way, by thinking one positive thought or doing one positive deed we make our immediate surroundings 1% better which in turn affects the universal balance of good vs. not good even in the smallest way.

f6qdqo,Sbeast,How to Overcome Nihilism,"**Introduction**

Nihilism is the rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless. The two main types are existential nihilism, which believes that life has no objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value, and moral nihilism which believes that morality does not exist.

It is often associated with extreme pessimism and radical skepticism. Nihilism is also typically associated with 19th century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who argued that the negative effects of nihilism would eventually destroy all moral, religious, and metaphysical convictions and precipitate the greatest crisis in human history.

The world nihilism ""comes from the Latin nihil, which translates as ‘nothing, and it also appears in the word ""annihilate,"" meaning to bring to nothing, to destroy completely.

Finally, nihilism is sometimes accompanied by feelings of depression, cynicism, pessimism, or anxiety, but it may be present without any of them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 1: Play**

A baby is born without an understanding of the meaning, or lack thereof, in the world, and yet it is born equipped with the desire to play in various games. The baby is quite happy being fully engaged in a game without feeling the need to question whether there is inherent meaning, or not, in the task. From this we can derive one of the problems that can occur in people who suffer from nihilism—they have stopped playing.

Whether you seek more games to play and engage in, or you simply adopt a more playful attitude towards life, it cannot hurt to try and it may help to distract you from feelings of nihilism for a while.

&gt;*""The most responsible way to live is that you are playful with life."" \~ Sadhguru*

Perhaps the nihilist is either taking life far too seriously, or is consumed by a search for the ultimate truth or belief system to explain the complexity of life in its entirety, whereas they may be better off taking a break from the bigger questions of life, and simply engaging in more playful activities. This is not to say that the bigger and deeper questions of life are unimportant, rather, a healthy and fulfilling life is better achieved through balance, and in this case balancing the serious and heavy subjects with a more lighthearted and playful approach to life.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 2: Altruism**

Altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings and/or animals. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular world views, though the concept of ""others"" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness, which is the opposite of selfishness.

One of the better ways to find or rediscover meaning in your life is to actively make a difference by contributing to the world in some way through altruism. The following are a list of ideas to try:

\- Help to feed or clothe the homeless.

\- Join an animal rights group.

\- Volunteer in a charity shop of soup kitchen.

\- Choose a vocation which is concerned with helping people.

\- Donate money to a worthwhile cause.

\- Random acts of kindness: Read this article for ideas on random acts of kindness: [https://daringtolivefully.com/random-acts-of-kindness-ideas](https://daringtolivefully.com/random-acts-of-kindness-ideas)

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 3: Faith and Spirituality**

A final tip to help with nihilism would be to explore the different faiths, religions, and spiritual practices around the world, which help to bring a sense of meaning and purpose to billions of peoples lives all around the world. Perhaps you are an atheist and may benefit from exploring spirituality, or perhaps you are already religious but your particular faith is not the right one for you. There is no harm in seeking additional truths and answers from other faiths and spiritual pathways. Some people may even be better suited to combining the best ideas and practices of various religions which best suit their personality, needs and circumstances.

\- Religions to explore: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Folk Religions, Judaism, Jainism, Shintoism, Taoism, Confucianism.

\- Spiritual Pathways: In Sacred Pathways: Discover Your Soul's Path to God, Gary L Thomas describes nine different spiritual styles or “sacred pathways.” A sacred pathway describes the way we relate to God, how we draw near to him. You can read more about spiritual pathways here: [https://visitgracechurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SpiritualStyle.pdf](https://visitgracechurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SpiritualStyle.pdf)

5. Activists: Loving God through Confrontation
6. Caregivers: Loving God by Loving Others
7. Enthusiasts: Loving God with Mystery and Celebration

**Quotes**

&gt;“When nihilists say that life is meaningless that isn’t exactly what they mean; they mean that life is suffering but there isn’t anything transcendent about it that you could set against that suffering.” \~ Jordan Peterson  
&gt;  
&gt;“It might be that the sense of meaning that life can provide to you is proportionate to the amount of responsibility you decide to take on.” \~ Jordan Peterson  
&gt;  
&gt;“He who has a why can bear almost any how.” \~ Friedrich Nietzsche  
&gt;  
&gt;“A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist.” \~ Friedrich Nietzsche  
&gt;  
&gt;“The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.” \~ Mark Twain  
&gt;  
&gt;“I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.” \~ Viktor Frankl  
&gt;  
&gt;“If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete.” \~ Viktor Frankl  
&gt;  
&gt;“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.” \~ Viktor Frankl

f6n6g4,K80n3,What is Truth?,"So I am having a conversation with someone on discord. We have competing views on what truth is. 4 things:
1. His view of truth, is that truth actually exists. For example he thinks “a rock” is true. Not that “a rock exists” is true but that “a rock” is true. 
2. My view of truth, is that the relationship between a proposition and “what is” or “reality” is where true can appear. And that if a proposition matches reality then and only then is there truth. And it is that the relationship between the proposition and reality is true. For example in my view, “a rock” wouldn’t be true or false. But “a rock exists” would be true if a rock actually exists in reality. 
3. Is it possible to convince someone out of their view of truth... because to do so they would have to be convinced that their view of truth is wrong... but that judgement itself relies on their theory of truth. 
4. The only way I can think of accomplishing number 3 is by taking a theory of truth and showing internal inconsistencies... so does anybody have any internal inconsistencies in either his view or my view of truth. Or any other way of showing that either view is wrong.

f64js9,jackcrafty22,"""Consciously Mean To"" ?","“Logically, when the amygdala wants to mobilize a behavior—say, fleeing—it talks to the frontal cortex, seeking its executive approval. But if sufficiently aroused, the amygdala talks directly to subcortical, reflexive motor pathways. Again, there’s a trade-off—increased speed by bypassing the cortex, but decreased accuracy. Thus the input shortcut may prompt you to see the cell phone as a gun. And the output shortcut may prompt you to pull a trigger before you **consciously mean** **to**.”

&amp;#x200B;

This quote displays two causes of an action: the ""output shortcut"" and the ""consciously mean to"". My question is:

This quote, by a well known neuroscientist, names two pathways that cause human action. I think the whole business of the subconscious making decisions before your conscious mind realizes them, and then the conscious mind has no choice but to ""go along for the ride"" is proved to be trash by this quote. In other words, if the subconscious is calling all the shots, there is no ""consciously mean to"".

f63dw2,SmittyWerb93,Limits on the Social Contract,"  

Last week I had a five hour text conversation with one of my longest standing friends that spanned multiple related topics, although I believe the entire discussion/argument fell within two principal concepts: the social contract and freedom of speech. We've had extremely heated arguments before, both in person and virtually, but this one definitely took the cake for most acrimonious. I'm basically using this subreddit to recollect the basic thoughts and arguments so that others might chime in and provide perspective. Multiple pieces of the conversation are recollected below and re-purposed into questions for you to ponder and answer. 

Note: regulation here always implies state intervention but is otherwise free of specific policy prescription

 

1. The catalyst for the entire conversation can be paraphrased into the following scenario + question(s): you are worried that the future generation of working women (Gen X + Y) is becoming overly concerned with their bodies (image) and more interested in selling their looks than in ""improving society"" and working towards a better future (i.e., being ""productive members of society"" and having dignity, etc.). You observe that this ""degradation"" is occurring at a worsening rate due to the internet and social media, specifically by apps like Instagram. The assumption is that social media is the principal, but not the sole, cause. You observe that its continuation may result in a reversal if not a stagnation in womens' rights, etc. Given this scenario, is it acceptable or worth considering regulations that might impose a cost on individuals attempting to consume social media in this way? For example, what of the idea of imposing a ""nude tax"" which would essentially put a dollar price for posting naked/revealing selfies of yourself on Instagram? While I do not support such an example per se, the concept remains interesting: should you regulate social media in the pursuit of social equity and perhaps at the price of limiting free speech?

2. Social contract hypothetical: “If there are 100 people in the community and 20 are suicidal, the regulation affects all 100. 50% reduction in suicide suggests only 10 of the people remain suicidal. 10 people benefit from a regulation that ""hurts"" all.” Do you regulate? ---- Obviously it depends on the regulation. For the affirmative, can/should freedom of speech be regulated in any way under this hypothetical (and other similar scenarios)?

3. Do the physical and virtual realms exhibit the same social qualities (think of online echo chambers and radical groups)? If the government starts to regulate social media that in any way regulates the free flow of information/speech, will this necessarily percolate into the physical realm, with the government imposing limits on our freedom of speech? Does a regulation in the physical realm have the same net effect/potential in the virtual realm, and vice versa? The concern is that any regulation that might curb freedom of information or speech in the virtual realm will necessarily, eventually, happen in the physical. Is this true?

4. Finally, is regulating access and content of the internet morally wrong, no exceptions? 

&amp;#x200B;

There exist perspectives that contradict each other. Examples of paradoxes are matter versus mind as the foundation of reality, time existing versus just the present moment, and free will versus destiny.

Thesis:

All paradoxes can be resolved with the Law of One in which all perspectives are valid. The Law of One states that ""all things are one, that there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity.""

1. There exists an infinite set containing all perspectives.

2. Each moment, a consciousness being chooses its identity which is the selection of a subset of perspectives from the Infinite Set of all perspectives that have ever been thought and will ever be thought.

3. The experience of contradictions is when a consciousness chooses to reject at least one perspective in its Identity.

4. The experience of clarity is when a consciousness decides to accept all perspectives in its identity.

Holding two, possibly opposing, perspectives is called bilocational consciousness, holding three perspectives is called trilocational consciousness, and holding more is called multilocational consciousness. Many humans choose to identify with only one perspective at a time and struggle with perceiving from perspectives or locations simultaneously. My purpose in this post is to present a solution for those who struggle with this so that there may be less strife between us as a people. I feel great love for all beings and feel the pain and anger emitting from those still learning to develop consciousness.

Let us examine some paradoxes and use the Law of One to resolve them.

Paradox 1: A shape cannot both be a circle and a square.

This can be approached from many perspectives, but I shall present three possible solutions. First, the perspective as literally stated is valid: a circle is not a square. Second, the shape could be a 3D cylinder that is a circle when projected two dimensionally in one direction and a square when projected two dimensionally in another direction. Thus, the shape is both a circle and a square.Third, we could perceive a circular dimensional system as opposed to a linear one in which a circle would have equal sides in all dimensions and could be called square in this system. All perspectives can be held simultaneously.

Paradox 2: Matter and mind cannot both be the foundation of reality.

This perspective is both true and false depending on perspective. From the truth perspective, matter and mind are separate and one must cause the other. If matter is the foundation, mind is created from it. If mind is the foundation, matter is created from it. From the false perspective, matter and mind are completely intertwined and are both necessary for reality. One does not cause the other, but rather they have always co-existed. All perspectives can be held simultaneously.

Paradox 3: Time exists and does not exist.

From the time existing perspective, memories can be viewed in the present moment and chosen to be viewed as literal and linear. One memory proceeds from another one at a time. Thus, time exists. From another perspective, only the present moment is observable, and memories can be seen non-linearly in which it is just imagination of other present moments, but the memories don't actually exist elsewhere. Thus, time does not exist. All perspectives can be held simultaneously.

Paradox 4: Free will and destiny both exist.

Again, this is both true and false. When seen as true, each consciousness experiences the sensation of choosing so free will exists. At the same time, the consciousness makes choices based on experiences that it not choose so that is destiny. When the original statement is seen as false, only free will or destiny can exist at one time because if a being chooses all experiences they cannot happen outside of choosing. On the other hand, if there is no choosing, then there is no free will. All perspectives can be held simultaneously.

There are many other implications of the Law of One, but using it as a tool for paradox resolution is a good starting point for beginners to consciousness expansion leading to multidimensionality and multilocationality.

Possible opposing views:

1. There will always be contradictions!

Indeed, you are correct. But at the same time, there are no contradictions depending on perspective and consciousness capability.

2. A statement cannot both be true and false!

Indeed, you are correct. But at the same, your statement is both true and false.

3. Your ideas will lead us into chaos and the removal of truth!

Indeed, you are correct. But at the same time, what is more true than integrating all perspectives without rejection into one framework? One person looks at the Universe and sees simplicity. Another ponders itself and sees complexity. Thus is the way of things, my friend. Let us seek evermore into the vast unknown of the One Self.

When I was a little girl my father told me about a bird that lived on our roof. A rare bird with bright orange feathers and a blue beak, the size of a dog. I always wanted to see the bird and I begged my father to bring it to me. He never would. He insisted I would scare it away. Years later, one day, when I returned to my childhood home to see my family when everyone was asleep, I crept onto the roof, but the bird was gone. I had waited so long to see her. 

The bird had never been there. It was a fable that my father created because he wanted us to live in awe. It is a gift to be in awe of something, anything. But we can’t creep up on rare birds to see them.

f5nh4j,OU_crouton,Habitual Existence: We're all God and everything is gonna be ok,"**TLDR: Everything is going to be ok.**  
St Anselms Ontological argument for the existence of God defines God as a “Being than which nothing greater can be conceived”. The fundamental question being “Is god real? Or is it just in our heads?"" It basically says that since we can conceive of a perfect being, such a being must exist in reality. If God only existed in our minds, he would be missing out on the real world, therefore wouldn’t be a perfect being. So if we are able to conceive of perfection (God), perfection must exist in reality.  Such a being must surely be **""all of existence”. Referring to every thing that exists.**   *Remember St Anselms definition of God: A being than which nothing greater can be conceived.*  
Regardless of whether said being exists in reality or the understanding alone, **""all of existence""** is the only thing that could possibly meet that definition as there couldn’t logically be anything outside of it for it to be compared to, making it the greatest “being” there is. As to what **“all of existence”** means no body knows maybe an infinite universe, maybe an infinite multiverse, maybe an infinite multiverse and whatever is in-between the universes??? No one knows but that’s not the point.  
St Anselm had a good argument, but he was hung up on **God as a character .** For him it was that good old Judeo-Christian father figure. For some it's Allah, for others its Jah. Some people have one character, some have hundreds. It’s human nature to personify things that they don’t understand, when they do this for **all of existence,** they get a “Godhead”. A godhead is sort of a finger pointing at everything. It’s our concept of whatever God is to us. St Anselm was one of many theologians defending his godhead, believing it to be the only valid character. So if we accept that “God” is **all of existence,** piggy backing off of the Ontological argument, who or what is the godhead?  
The closest thing we’d have to “God” as a person would logically be **all of sentience.** It’s about time I acknowledge the stickiness of the words one must use to talk about that which can’t be understood. When I say “God is all Sentience” sentience can mean a whole lot of things. Other words that work could be consciousness, awareness, life, self, soul, spirit. So there you have it, **God is everything, if you’re looking for its personality look no further than consciousness itself.** So everyone is god, life is god, love is god, awareness is god, infinity is god, blah blah blah it all checks out.  
One can easily see that this is the common theme behind most human religion. Take the Hindu’s concepts of *Atman* (the ultimate self) and *Brahman* (the ultimate reality), which they believe to be fundamentally the same thing. To throw some scripture at you,

 ""Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?” - (1 Corinthians 3:16)  

""I said, “You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you;” - (Psalm 82:6)

  
Buddhism (especially Zen Buddhism), Taoism, most Native American religions, ancient Shamanistic traditions from all around the globe. In general, when humans analyze the nature of being they end up talking about some all encompassing *force/being/somethin* that exists every living thing.  
Look at religion. Look at philosophy. Look at the scientists in quantum mechanics, struggling to figure out why our observations seem to effect the universe at its most basic levels. Look at the god damn placebo effect. Most importantly, look within yourself. The more you look the more it adds up. If you’ve looked into all of these and aren’t convinced, take DMT or psilocybin mushrooms then come back to me and tell me who you are.  


**Following all of that nonsense:** If we’re all basically god by nature of being conscious **(whatever that means)** then whatever is truly believed during life must be the truth **(whatever that means)**. \*cough cough placebo effect hello???\*

  
**""Well great!” I hear you say, amazed that you’re still reading my ramblings, “So I’m god…So what?”**  
**...**  
**Exactly.**

  
 So what does it mean for us?  


1. Nothing, which is kind of the same as everything
2. Whatever you believe it to mean
3. No one knows anything because everyone knows everything.
4. Questions only need to be answered because we insist on asking them
5. Similarly to 4, we only suffer because we insist of not accepting the way things are
6. **There is fundamentally nothing to be afraid of. Everything is OK**

The only problems are the ones we subject ourselves to. The source of suffering is a mistaken approach to the concept of belief. The idea that one true belief can be in some way inferior or superior to another true belief gives rise to all doubt/mistakes. Evil, greed, inequality, fear, hostility, etc. are all symptoms of basic distrust of the universe. **When ones realizes that they basically are the universe, one realizes that there is no problem. Enlightenment is acceptance.**  
We are all God just trying to figure things out, and the most important thing to figure out is that there is nothing to figure out. Everything is true and false, right and wrong, yes and no, on and off. **It’s all figured out for you by nature of being.**

Everything IS and when everything IS, nothing ISN’T and when nothing ISN’T, EVERYTHING IS NOTHING AND NOTHING IS EVERYTHING. 

Or somethin like that dude I don't have a clue what I'm talking about. Existence is a mess and the best thing you can do for yourself and everyone around you is believe it to be a pleasant mess. Being is an infinity-party waiting for you to join in the fun. We’re here to love, laugh, play, and cry. And all of those are the same thing. Affliction and delusion are games we play.

f5mlir,ImACapitalistPiG,Alan Watts vs Jordan Peterson,"First off I want to say that I think it's a shame that Alan Watts and Jordan Peterson will never do a podcast together. But that's besides the point. 
I've been listening to both Peterson's and Watt's lectures for some years and I agree with a lot of what both of them say.
 However I think to some extent they have very contradicting view points at least on a surface level. 
 If I have to put it in a nutshell, I feel like Jordan Peterson emphasizes personal responsibility and accountability. And he also believes that there is objective Good and Evil.
 Where as Alan Watts seems to believe that life is more like a play and we are just playing different roles and it's not meant to be taken seriously. And also seems to believe good and evil are relative or that are two sides of the same coin basically. 
(I know this is a gross oversimplification) 
 But the heart of my question is how do you or is it even possible to reconcile the viewpoints of these two great thinkers? 
 My personal sense is that listening to Jordan Peterson is more helpful in a practical way if your goal is to get ahead in life and put your life in order like he would say. So Jordan Peterson is right in the sense that he's giving you the road map to win in life (or at least to play the game optimally)
 But Alan Watts is right in a bigger picture type of way. Meaning that the universe and life is ultimately just a big stage and we are ultimately actors. And ultimately we can choose to either take it seriously or not. And neither of these choices is fundamentally wrong.
 What do you think?

f4tt9l,P_Griffin2,Why does anything exist ?,"I’m curious as to how the big brains of Reddit will approach this issue, as I myself am struggling to wrap my mind around it.

I have always considered myself an atheist in the past, but getting older has for some reason made me somewhat spiritual.
Nevertheless, I would like to believe that I am a man of science.

I can accept the fact that our existence is random. And that we do not really have a purpose in this world. That we are simply carbon beings walking around, not having anywhere in particular to go.
However the question of purpose does still bother be somewhat. Not the purpose of our individual selves, but the purpose of “stuff” in general.

Our universe burst into existence out of nothing, fair enough. But why ?
If everything is truly pointless, why does the universe even exist ?
Why is there not just a void of darkness with nothing in it ? If there is no point anyway.

Doesn’t the universe, being, and consciousness in some sense reflect a point ?

I’m not saying there is a purpose of living a true life. Or aiming for some eternal afterlife. I’m just saying that the universe is there, and the empty void is not.

f4msda,Torontogcreative,Suicide for people who have incurable mental illness is ethical and should be legalized worldwide if they want it.,"My first premise is that person choice in accord of free will allows all people the right to choose how to dictate their life. Secondly, when someone has suffering consistently without a cure for it such as permanent mental illness. They inherently have the right to choose upon themselves to end their suffering as it is unethical to force someone to live a life where it is permanent. In such cases of terminal illnesses this is legal in several countries. However it does preclude for incurable mental illness. 

A rational human being can be said they act upon free will and not under some provision such as pain. Yet if a person's identity is that of a permanent incurable mental illness they are inherently rational in their own personal choices even in their consistent pain. As long as they inherently can live functioning without being in a ward such as autism. Thus they have freedom of choice to live whichever life they want; including to end it.

The constitute of consistent suffering of someone such as autism; over 80 to 90 percent unemployment for adults thus poverty. Many are not able to live independently, many suffer from seizures or other mental pain such as migraines, lack of love and friendships, and difficulty with socialization and living in this capitalistic society. I would know because I have autism and also have a Genius IQ yet I believe that if given the choice I would have euthanasia. I attempted but failed twice but I want to given the choice to die in humane manner. Even though I'm employed, educated,  and physically don't have pain. I have consistently wanted to end my own life and isn't legal under the laws here. The suicide rate for autism is 15 times the general population of society. Which the vast majority have an average or above average IQ yet want to. 

This is because it is incurable and many come to this realization. They should have freedom of choice to end their own lives as it is a permanent and incurable  disorder. For the record I have spent over 10 years visiting mental institutions for family members and seen others there. The conditions to which many face are horrible and the homeless rates prove that many suffer from permanent mental illness. 

I will firmly state that I do not advocate forcibly euthanizing people against their will and choice due to mental illnesses because that is morally wrong and unethical. Including if someone wants to live in their own lives that is their freedom.

 However I firmly think it is ethical and morally sound for personal euthanasia for incurable mental illness if they want it. In regards that they feel that it causes them suffering and it isn't curable; they don't want to live with it for decades until they die of old age. In euthanasia the accordance should be with medical supervision and diagnosis of their incurable illness; evaluation that they are suffering without cure and want their choice of dying in a peaceful and humane way.",0,1581834420,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f4msda/suicide_for_people_who_have_incurable_mental/,philosophy,1

f4lum6,thebigb-bangisalie,The Freedom of Choice Riddle,"The Freedom of Choice Riddle 


Both sets of participants in an exercise have complete freedom of choice.   Any freedom you want to assume, do so.  Freedom even to completely ignore the incentive program, for example or to use it, benefit from it even cheat on it. 


Ok, our groups:

1) local business 

2) local customers 


The set up:  a savvyier group of the business owners figure out a method to increase business and help their customers.   To work it must be simple and completely free of choice in all considerations however - but they  plan well and they know they can opt out in all manner at any point.  So, seeing the potential for good benefits not only for their business but for the customers which can only benefit them, they decide they would try it at least once and had of course the freedom to opt out or try again the experience, however they liked.  Other businesses could also participate in any way they desired including the ability to create their own versions and to ask for their reimbursement or not or to join the next round as sponsor or not, etc. Any combination is allowed should they desire - they could even offer that a group of 10 to pool their quarters on their phones to buy a needy person a coffee.  Whatever is devised as deemed best by any business and what they request back from the pool is also their business.   The pool of money can be used in any manner even by businesses not contributing , they could up the ante by adding tree-pair walks for double discount no matter which days even separate days, etc.  Complete freedom is essential 


The plan is simple 

A list of pairs of trees some desired walking distance apart is derived.  Could be 30 min or more or less etc.   Whatever is deemed optimal by what ever criteria.   An arbitrarily small pot is pooled from which ever business wants to participate is gathered.  Other than being able to claim contributions, there are no strings attached to directly benefit them.  Perhaps they can display a poster made by a local artist to indicate the contribution.   Risk is non existant - should you sprain your ankle walking, it's all your choice.  If a business cheats and looses customers, it's all their fault. 


The exercise program run: any person can walk the park, and if they take the time to take the photos on their phone of any pair, which they can delete at any time they like before or after or anytime, if they want or not - to show they did the exercise.  And should they desire, once during any visit to any business they can ask if the photos can be used to benefit themselves or someone else with them. 


So, do the business men continue the experiment or not and why?


I think that as long as the bar is low enough and sufficient minimum incentive there, the system will equilibrate with more people walking and using local business and the bigger the incentive, the faster and larger the benefits with lasting benefits even should the program of incentives stop 


I would claim something positive started from almost nothing, benefiting all on average, no matter if a particular person even opted to participate in any manner at all",2,1581829022,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f4lum6/the_freedom_of_choice_riddle/,philosophy,1

f4lrky,Iamapigeonwoof,This was a response I gave to a post from a girlfriend who's boyfriend believes in solipsism. She feels terrible that she is perceived as a figment of his imagination. This is my response. Let me know what you think. Thank you.,"I think I got a philosophical solution to this.

I had my phase in solipsism too. And from my perspective at the time, it was very logical to think like this. Indeed my relationship quality with others degraded somewhat. If others are not conscious like you are, why treat them that way? This is a conflicting feeling that solipsists experience. Not that you'd immediately treat them badly, but an important reason for connecting with people on the 'same level' is because they are conscious too. Note that anything in philosophy can be 'true' as long as you argue it (and if you don't agree with that, then you have your arguments for that too). Solipsism takes that to the extreme. Now arguments are even less persuasive than normal because others are not conscious, so why believe their arguments. 

To get out of it can be tough. So, here's what you do. If you persuade him of the opposite, that is that others are conscious, then he'll resist and sink deeper into his solipsist views. Since it's the polar opposite, that makes his view that more wrong, and so can make it that more difficult to let go of it (this goes for all views, I'd say). It may also be embarrassing to come out of this, since believing you're the only conscious one can be perceived as very egoistic.

Instead, be playful with the idea everytime he brings it up. So that there is no resistance. This will make him bring it up more. Which is necessary, because it is talking about it that will be the eventual cure. So, maintain an open attitude, and realize also that on some level it could potentially be true anyways. He will sense that you are taking it seriously.

Then aim to destabilize his beliefs in it, not aggressively. Just ask questions about it. How does it work? What happens when you die? Why this body and not another? This will hopefully lead him to see that there are still unanswered questions, or unsatisfying answers, which weakens his beliefs, naturally so. And specifically ask him this question: 'Which version of solipsism do you believe in?' You can say that you read on the internet somewhere that there are many versions, don't need to know which ones. Just the idea that there are versions of his 'holy' belief, makes it less 'holy'. By holy I mean this almost religious type of attachment to the belief, 'the perfect worldview'.

Keep repeating this, and let him confront himself by these things. All you have to do is fill him up with questions, but slowly. 

In any case it might just be a phase and he needs to explore this for himself. If he gets out of it, he'll be a better thinker (and philosopher) because of it. 

Another thing to add is that when I believed in solipsism I was also unhappy to an extent, and in pain. I was unaware of this. And so, creating solipsism as a belief can help cope with that. My pain, for example, was that of hurting or having hurt others. Solipsism was an convenience as others could not truly experience pain, therefore set me free from it. Although it didn't completely free me because I still had inner doubt of solipsism (which he'll probably have to, even if you don't notice). So, it is also an emotional belief, not only logical. Examine what could bother him, maybe he just needs to go on holidays, be away from the tediousness of life - so that he doesn't have to create an all extreme belief to keep his childlike wonder of life.

I study philosophy, and I am intrigued by this post. Especially since I relate to this on a personal level too. Normally I don't write this much, but I also emphasize with you. It is tricky situation. I think more and more people are choosing to believe in solipsism. I think because we have so many unanswered questions, and for an increasing amount of us there isn't a God anymore to fill in the blank. So, we do it ourselves. 

I would love to hear an update on this.

When I die, I will have no sense of time. You need time to determine if something exists, right? The time between when something first began to exist and stopped existing. The thing is, my sense of time will no longer be able to determine what exists and when it exists because my sense of time itself won’t exist. How can you differentiate between 10 seconds and 10 million years when you are not there to measure that time? Does that not mean, that in some way, I’m the centre of the universe?

f4ficv,ChemicalGreen,Deep Sponoza,"Haggia Sophia is either a fourth aspect (material-energetic-information) or all of the above three combined. Physical thoughts—this would seem to confirm Spinoza’s view of substantia and natura as God. (“Deus sive substantia sive natura.”)

Look: a perception of the two aspects matter and mind is not mind and it is not matter; it is one third thing. There is thought involved as information, but the matter is simply not what we call matter —the whole thing resembles—well, it’s physical. But— But what is obvious is that what we call “matter” is a partial view, and pure mind would be partial (we can’t see it). We see mind, and matter is information-rich. Neither aspect is more fundamental than the other. It is not thinking matter and it is not material thought: it is what it is. If I could see my brain as I think I’d see linking and relinking: a physical event for each thought.

What I saw was Godhead Sophia; and her mind was in fusion with mine. Neither the concept “thinking matter” nor “material thought” is quite correct. The first suggests that we are dealing with something matter is capable of doing; it is a property of matter. The second is misleading because it suggests a vehicle for thought as ink and paper are a vehicle for language—a way to write it down—make it physical.

But in point of fact I saw matter cease to be matter; it became something else that we have no name for—but I swear, it was no longer matter. Conversely, it was not just a physical medium for thoughts because for one thing (to repeat) it was no longer matter, no longer physical in the usual sense. So matter ceased to be matter. Okay. Did mind cease to be mind? Yes. It turned into— All I can think of is Pythagoras’ special use of the term kosmos. “The harmonious fitting together of the beautiful.” But nonetheless glyphs—still information. (Of this, Pythagoras does not speak.)

I can only think of the final canto in The Commedia about the Book. It was a three-dimensional structure that was (at the same time) a book. Or like a musical score. It was a way of encoding information in a structure or as a structure. Time consisted of accretional layers and there was no locus (lens-system) viewpoint. It constantly changed (became more complex, which is to say, more information-rich). Information as reality—yes. Matter turned into one vast intricate structure. That was information and by being “played” yielded up everything, viewed from every subjective viewpoint, that had ever been or ever would be. It was played by being perceived. (Open wide.) Yes; playback came through anamnesis of it. Just seeing matter—there is no life to it, hence no sentient movement—which is the activity which is information.

We are seeing only the carrier! As in frequency. The information is missing. And mind alone has not the beauty of the geometric forms! That is, the attribute mind: only when the two attributes mens and natura are perceived together does the beauty appear: form, proportion, color, ratio, harmony, motion, shape. The thoughts must be seen for their true value (which is beauty) to be discerned. Consider the information (word) cat and an actual cat. How beautiful is a recording of Beethoven to Beethoven?

No wonder I thought of my experience as postmortem. While alive I “saw the God whom we see when we die,” as the

Could this be indeed the kingdom of God that Jesus/Sophia spoke of? Finding a way to see the other attribute of substantia? The information (mind thinking) for which matter is the carrier (medium/system)?",1,1581799900,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f4ficv/deep_sponoza/,philosophy,1

Here we will choose a book that talks about topics that include Martial Arts, the Warrior Archetype, Fight &amp; Life Strategy, Inspiration and so on.  We are sure that the list of these kind of  books is very long and for that reason we decided to create and present them in sections. In the meantime we have the opportunity to exchange our experiences and also leave an open window for whoever that wants to suggest a great book about these topics.  The Book that we present today is called "" The Book of Five Rings"" by author Miyamoto Musashi, one of the greatest Swordsman, Military Strategist and Philosophers in Japan.   In these book we can find timeless lessons that can be applied not only in Martial Arts but definitely also as a Way of Life.  For more details we invite you to watch the video, and at the same time we sincerely hope that this Section gives you some great suggestions about the Books that you want to enrich your library with.

f4aafz,VanishingPencil,"Into the Wild, Alexander Supertramp","Hey guys,

So Into the Wild is one of my favourite movies. It's been since the first time I saw it many years ago.

I couldn't convey all of Chris' philosophies and quotes, but mainly I wanted to do something that makes people that never saw the movie interested on his personality- so I made this small fanvideo about the movie, on my very recent YouTube channel.

I think that the people that might be interested in spending a couple of minutes watching this small edit are mainly people that didn't watch the movie, it came out in 2007.

Although for anyone who enjoyed it, and I believe many on this subreddit did, and wants to relive it for a little while, I hope you enjoy it too.

https://youtu.be/0hJLG5Cy0hY

I think many of the quotes, beliefs and change of Christopher McCandless is amazing. Although I also know that the movie is not 100% faithful to the real story, I would totally recommend it.

f49q54,MPEReraOR,"Infinitty,Love and the absolute madness of Evil","So it goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

why are you doing anything?

anything you do,you do because you care ,

&amp;#x200B;

example you want money to sustain yourself or you wanna have good a good time or feel safe , why?because you care about yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

what is love?

love is caring alot,

ofc eveyone loves themselves but you can love others also ask your mother if you aint an orphan chances are she will confim it,i hope without having to fuck you to prove it given your claims that love is sex,unless you are an orphan in which case i guess you are lucky compared to certain inbread motherfuckers

most of the time loving caring liking sex they can be entwined,that unconditional love stuff or true love at times they use it at least are nonsense,they are saying those stuff to alleviate guilt so they can start selling their love as pure,pure from truth,but its as simple as it sounds really you can like someone,care deeply about someone

and wanting(generally also) to keep fucking someone since sex is a great way to connect more,among other things.

there is nothing pure about being a little bitch where u say you love someone no matter what even though thats like

anything,i could thing of alot of things when it comes to no matter what that if they do to you and you still love him/her etc... wishfull thinking and even if you make it true well then you are retarded,

&amp;#x200B;

i could continue like this for entire pages but i think i made my point

&amp;#x200B;

adoration

when you say i love this dress basically thats not love thats like alot,

example i like this shoes then you go to i like this shoes alot then its not love its i adore those shoes,not love

&amp;#x200B;

hate

hate is dislike alot, not the opposite of love but the opposite of adoration ,but thats the only way some people can pretend they are positive forces to basically sell what they like or dislike 

&amp;#x200B;

jealousy and envy and also superiority

they are both denial.

basically when you think others with your nonsense measuring of things naturally your brain will put a fire on your ass when your measuring dont suit you,whatever your are better than others for also applies to you being inferior.someone might feel sorry for you and spare your feelings but our own brains clearly dont

its caused because you meet people from the 3rd option\* way ahead of you at being rats racing

whether you say you are jealous(denial) but you admit it so you aint in denial (read the sentence but instead of jealousy say denial) ,get it?

envy is simply getting aggresive-toxic-malicious instead of the above

\*3rd option they winner not loser,they is the best ,get it?going around all day safe and better than others yet they dont get jelly using those same thoughts when someone even better at which/whom they care comes along,yes they is better than some yet noone is better than you ,sure sure

&amp;#x200B;

cant even tell which is more pathetic

You are all BUSTED

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

good and bad

now since everyone doing anything cause of care how bad things happen?very easily since they are not being caring positevely when you say example i only care about money ,you dont care about platic paper,you care about you so you wanna have safety or fun or this or that but you skip the part that thats not necessarily true and even if it is,its circomstantial,someone like you made it to be so to begin with,not absolute

and how things can be so twisted?well every single one of the people that made or done something bad they always 

say internally if not also externally that they dont care about him/her/them etc..

now whats dont care?its nothing so every time someone says dont care you should replace the word with nothing,

so think the meaning of the those various thoughts and sentences and the validity of saying nothing

i wont give you examples for both valid and not valid someone else would be better at that but some times if asked about something

a valid response is nothing but when someone was doing something bad nothing is never a valid one,not only that it also doesnt make sense like the following example

you did this so you can make money even though so many people got hurt                                   response   i dont care about them they are dumb                  

so basically    

i nothing.      and also what they add after nothing is irrelevant

so basically 0 sense          

&amp;#x200B;

there is more to be said but this kinda says everything anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

care alot=love

like alot=adore 

dislike alot=hate

not caring=nothing(emptiness)

f3t5xf,the_negativest,"Until star trek replicators are created, industrial food production of any kind is immoral, unsustainable, and harmful to the environment.","There are 7 billion people on this planet. Feeding just the US with meat has led to the atrocious practice of factory farming. Killing billions of living organisms every year for the sole purpose of sustenance. These organisms are treated inhumanely, and killed inhumanely. And many feel that replacing factory farming of meat with non living foods will fix the problem. Unfortunately, maintaining fields of this size does not equal less suffering necessarily. Rodents and other pests will die, and if one considers insects living organisms, the. The amount killed by pesticides will certainly outweigh the amount of cows, pigs, and chickens being killed. Additionally, pesticides and herbicides will continue to flow into our water tables and rivers, polluting our waters and killing people and fish. Without proper crop rotation soils will be depleted rapidly, increasing the need for industrial fertilizers which contribute to pollution through releasing nitrates. Chain supermarkets will continue buying plastic wrapped produce, which has taken the place of plastic wrapped meat, and the plastic will be eaten by gulls and fish and wind up in the Pacific garbage patch. Bees will likely suffer as other insects do with increases in pesticide use and the same john Deere's, mack trucks, and train car shipments of produce will smog the atmosphere with CO2. Basically, the enemy isnt industrial farming, it's just a symptom. Commercial consumerism and, dare I say, unregulated capitalism are the world killers here. If people from developed countries stop needing more, less will be produced. Fewer plundered natural resources. Less loss of life. Less pollution. Less misery. The cost? Fewer meals a day. Smaller portions. Less convenience. Less fast food more farmers markets. People keeping phones for more than 3 years, and car companies creating products that can be maintained without propriety. Smaller homes built in a airtight manner, the list goes on and on. Its admirable to crusade for the. Betterment of life for cows, pigs, and chickens. But know the enemy, as regrettable as it is, is not the industry, but the people who keep it in business.",1,1581691610,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f3t5xf/until_star_trek_replicators_are_created/,philosophy,1

f3qy8h,gunghoyo,I Am Not Satisfied With My Knowledge of the Universe,"Hi guys, just joined this discord in a very specific frustration I’ve been having with life lately. I recently started working overnight at a gas station and I’ve had a lot of time to think, study and learn topics on science, philosophy and life overall.

I’ve looked a lot of different things and mostly I am very unsatisfied with my knowledge of the beginning of not only the universe but myself, and also the end of myself and the universe. A lot of philosophers say that we shouldn’t fear death because death is inevitable and why spend life fearing the inevitable? My fear is FOMO and it is said that why should we be afraid of missing out on something when we’ve already missed out on so much but don’t care. I think this argument is very, very stupid.

We have access to so much knowledge through the internet, people and so many other resources. I have learned so much about biology and the inobservable sciences that continue to fascinate me and have more and more to learn about.

And we can easily see that this continual learning of new things will not be ceasing soon. A lot of times in philosophy we can question our current reality as not being reality because knowledge on a topic is not yet discovered. That statement just gets me not only excited, but afraid. I want to be able to learn of these newer things, and to see people discover and cross amazing milestones for humanity, but I’m just a human that will only live for around 80 years. I want to see the development of space and how we learn about things like dark matter and energy and how me can eventually harvest energy in so many new ways. I want to see developments in medicine that can help with aging and can reduce or even get rid of cancer in a patient’s body. These things are decently close in my Years sure, but I want to see so much more.

I don’t know what to think anymore. I don’t know how I will think years from now but I sit here and think about this and I just become frustrated. I want to know more about myself and my life and the science behind it all and even what is our reality. We would seriously be ignorant to say that our reality is exactly what we see it as and it should never be questioned. And I haven’t even touched on religion, I mean afterlife? It’s all so intimidating to think about and I just feel extremely overwhelmed but excited to see development and them disappointed because I know I will be limited on what I will see in my life time.

I’m not look for any kind of format or even an answer. I just want to hear people’s opinions and what they have to say. Thanks, hopefully this can be helpful to others too.",1,1581680037,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f3qy8h/i_am_not_satisfied_with_my_knowledge_of_the/,philosophy,1

f3qc7p,marxhitchenssocrates,Modern politics and 19th century German Philosophy,"I have been thinking about modern politics for a while, and I just picked up a book on Hegel. I dont really know much about Hegel's philosophy, but I've read a bit of Heraclitus and Marx. I was thinking about the recent rise of Bernie, and I thought it was interesting that a leftist may actually win the nomination. From what I understand, a part of Hegel's thought is the concept of the thesis, antithesis and the synethis. I would like in this post to give a brief survey of recent political dynamics, analyze the potential contest between Trump and Bernie, and attempt to predict the nature of the potential election between Trump and Bernie. 

From the 1990's onwards, there seemed to be a synthesis between the Democratic and Republican theses.  This synthesis seemed to have been centered around an establishment politics. By 2016, this kind of synthesis seemed to have broken down. Trump was able to defeat candidates favored by the Republican establishment. He was able to do this in part because he was against the establishment. This crystallized the process of a voter base becoming critical of the establishment as such. The popular turn against the Republican establishment gave rise to a new thesis that now represented the GOP. This new thesis is the Trump era. 

On the Democratic side, things seem to be happening somewhat similarly. The most enthusiastic democratic voters seem to be leaning toward Bernie. A similar turn against the Democratic establishment could occur. Similar to the way Trump was able to gain Republican establishment support was that he is popular with the base and is somewhat successful in carrying out his policies. Despite there being significant criticisms of Bernie, I could see establishment Democrats ultimately supporting his campaign. The main rallying cry of Democrats seem to be to rally against Trump. 

Bernie's rise seems to me to represent the dissatisfaction of the democratic base in the party establishment's answers to Trump. If Bernie does win the nomination, then that seems to complete the transition to a new political framework. This also implies a new thesis, anti-thesis, and synthesis. 

This leads me to the end of my point. I think it will be a quite interesting election if Bernie wins the nomination. I think it will also bring on a new culture of political competition. In the past, the politics of the economy and social concerns seem to have been rather separated issues. Now, I think the two concerns may be more fused. For instance, if we can say that Bernie's ""thesis"" constitutes economic and social leftism, then it follows that in an election that on one side is driven by this combination, then the very process of political conflict in the election would fuse the two issues together. If Bernie does win the nomination, then Trump will have to offer his own economic and social standpoints. As the importance of these two issues rise, the partisanship of the discussion rises as well. If one person points to the economic merits of trump, and the other person points to the social merits of Bernie, then the Trump supporter will probably offer their own social rebuttal that is represented by Trump. During this discussion though, I think that perhaps people will realize the illogic of clinging to one set of ideas favored by one side just because they actually support a set of ideas of the same candidate but in a different category of policies. 

I think it is also prudent to point out the populism of both candidates. Both Trump and Bernie attempt to disparage the establishment in a way that presents their own anti-establishment views on political policy. They also seem to have substantial support among working people. I could see this becoming a contest of two candidates trying to outdo each other in proposing populist politics. Through this conflict between Bernie and Trump, I could see the political puzzle of the country being completed.",1,1581675999,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f3qc7p/modern_politics_and_19th_century_german_philosophy/,philosophy,1

vulnerable and confused as we go through
life we attempt to eliminate these
feelings by trying to control the
conditions of the world around us we
seek to accomplish and obtain things
achieve higher status acquire wealth or
fame develop power and so on we live
with the persisting hopefulness that in
the future we will have and control
enough stuff to free ourselves of our
emptiness vulnerability and confusion
and find some ultimate happiness and
security outside of ourselves this
hopeful vision of the future might sound
reasonable but perhaps it is what keeps
us contained in our problems to help us
better understand and deal with our
seemingly unquenchable hunger for
ultimate control and happiness outside
of ourselves we will look to the ancient
philosophy of stoicism stoicism is a
philosophy that started in ancient
Greece and was then further popularized
in ancient Rome stoicism is an
especially unique philosophy and how
potently it has withstood the test of
time across thousands of years arguably
the teachings and wisdom of stoic
philosophy are equally if not more
relevant today than ever in recent
history stoicism has found huge appeal
it was used and encouraged by recent
historical leaders like George
Washington Thomas Jefferson and Nelson
Mandela written about by current popular
authors like Tim Ferriss Robert Greene
and Ryan holiday just to name a few and
has found a rather large community on
the Internet stoicism is enduring
popularity is not without good reason
the principles of stoicism can help us
find calmness presence and resilience in
a world of increasingly overt chaos
anxiety and insatiable desire for more
in stoicism we exist in a reality that
does not care about our personal opinion
of it we cannot ask it nicely to remove
the chaos suffering hardship and
uncertainty nor can we will ourselves
onto it with force in order to do so
however stoicism suggests that that does
not mean we are subject to be helpless
victims of the world rather stoicism
proclaims that there are two domains of
life our external being the things
outside of our mind which we cannot
control and the internal our
interpretations and reactions to the
external which we can control when we
persist with the belief that things
outside ourselves or things in the
future
will provide
with the form of ultimate happiness we
become dependent on things that are not
part of us nor part of what we can
control and thus remain endlessly
unsatisfied and unhappy we can and
should pursue the things that we deemed
preferable and interesting and not live
an inactive life however we must ensure
that on our pursuits our focus remains
on the internal and that we work to
derive our sense of joy from how we
think and act within our pursuits no
matter what task we undertake we will do
it wastefully if we assume that any of
what comes beyond the task will provide
anything better than the experience of
focus and presence in the task itself
there's nothing inherently wrong about
working towards and achieving wealth
Fame or power but in the Stoics mind
these things are merely to be enjoyed if
they do work out but not to be depended
on for one's happiness for if one is
dependent on them their happiness and
peace in life are especially susceptible
to being inconsistent taken or never
achieved at all
stoicism suggests that the sign of a
truly successful person is someone who
can be okay without the things he or she
typically desires or depends on for
comfort for no wealth materialistic
abundance fame or power has any value to
a happy life if the person who possesses
them has not yet learned to live
properly without them Roman Emperor and
stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius was
the most powerful person in the world
during his time he had access to
anything he could have ever wanted
yet he writes almost nothing material is
needed for a happy life for he who has
understood existence with access to the
world Marcus Aurelius lived with little
interest in the self-indulgence of
things outside of himself in order to
develop this fortitude a common practice
and stoicism is to on occasion
temporarily strip oneself of the things
they ordinarily depend on for comfort in
order to prove to themselves how strong
they truly are without the things they
think they need in the peace of classic
literature entitled letters from a stoic
Roman statesman and one of the most
renowned stoic philosophers Seneca
writes until we have begun to go without
them we fail to realize how unnecessary
many things are we've been using them
not because we needed them but because
we had them it isn't our constant
expectation that something outside
ourselves or in the future is needed for
a worthy experience of life that causes
our inability to ever find worthy experi
in life in the first place and led us
from a stoic Seneca discusses the idea
of how to properly handle ones time and
derive meaningful experience when
referring to time Seneca writes I advise
you to keep what is really yours and you
cannot begin to early for as our
ancestors believed it is too late to
spare when you reach the dregs of the
Cask of that which remains at the bottom
the amount is slight and the quality is
vile it is now that we must find time
and it is now that we must find
happiness if it is either that we are
seeking for if we do not focus the lens
through which we view life right now
everything we see from this moment
forward will remain out of focus for the
stoic the ability to find happiness in
spite of what occurs around us is
developed through character and
perspective we must realize that nothing
is good or bad inherently but only our
judgments and interpretations of things
can be good or bad the wise man Seneca
writes is neither raised up by
prosperity nor cast down by adversity
for always he is driven to rely
predominantly on himself and to derive
all joy from himself in other words we
must try to form our perspective to best
serve our ability to remain with
happiness and wonder regardless of the
ups and downs of life
stoicism suggests that we are but a tiny
feature of the entire body of nature and
everything that happens to us is a
matter of relevance and necessity to
everything beyond us in this we must
strive towards an acceptance and
indifference towards everything that
happens to us and instead focus our
attention on controlling our reactions
to the things that happen we must put
our best foot forward acting and living
with self honesty humility and good
virtue and welcome whatever the world
deals us in return good or bad with this
we can begin to free ourselves from the
chaos of the world and find some form of
happiness and presence within ourselves
the practice of stoicism is not easy by
any stretch and arguably to live a
completely stoic life is impossible
likely no person can be without moments
of desire or negative reaction to the
world around them however stoicism gifts
us with a target of wisdom to aim for a
happiness and calmness to strive for
when things are at their apparent worst
in a time where chaos and anxiety run
rampant across our screens where
cultural
to live certain ways and achieve certain
things overwhelm us 24/7 where we spend
a huge amount of time comparing
ourselves to and wanting the approval of
others our sense of happiness and peace
is becoming increasingly susceptible and
it is perhaps through stoicism that we
can attempt to hold on to it starting
from birth we seemingly run if not
sprint through life racing out of every
moment unsatisfied with what life is and
constantly looking to the future for
what life could be if we just obtain
something more or different our culture
is overwhelm us with the reinforcements
of this idea convincing us that in order
to be happy we have to achieve by own
and live perfect unaffected lives this
delusion however frenzies us with an
anxiety that we are then told by culture
we can rid ourselves of if we just
achieve a few more things make a little
more money be a little more popular and
buy a little more stuff creating an
endless feedback loop of unsatisfied
hunger if we cave into this we surrender
our life we give up ourselves we should
not like sheep follow the herd of
creatures in front of us making our way
where others go not where we ought to go
Seneca writes in the stoic view the
stuff we often find ourselves chasing in
life revealed to be rather Petty and
meaningless from a sufficient distance
we don't have much if any control on
what happens to us how people see and
treat us nor what happens because of
what we do and in the big picture none
of it really matters all that much and
so we must define our happiness not by
what we own or achieve not by how others
see us not by some bigger picture of
life but by how we think and see
ourselves and live our own life through
what we deem virtuous and relevant
stoicism tells us we can at last if we
wish calmly accept the conditions of our
and different reality and one-up it with
our own and different attitude in return.[Stoicism:The Art of Not Caring](https://youtu.be/uLOB6hj3M_Q)",0,1581658078,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f3njoi/stoicism_the_art_of_not_caring_notedid_not_write/,philosophy,1

f37iik,frankstan33,Realizing that an act is immoral does not necessarily mean that it will prevent you from executing it.,"This thought just occurred to me and I want to know if this argument is true. Sure, sometimes we might not do something because all of a sudden we realize that it is immoral. For example, we might be about to prank someone and suddenly we realize that it's immoral and the realization is able to successfully stop us from doing it. 

But I don't think that this always holds true. This sounds obvious I know, since we aren't robots who strictly follow guidelines. But an argument can be made against this by saying that what we do is always moral according to us. Therefore, any act can be defined as moral according to one's moral principle (this also suggests that we all have different moral values which I believe so). But then my counter-argument is, if this were the case then why does guilt exist? If all our act's were justified by us then why would we ever feel guilty about it? Therefore, I believe guilt occurs when we act against our own moral principles.

Therefore, I believe that it takes more than the realization (that the act is immoral) to stop the act itself. What could that more be? I don't know, but my guess would be will power and other factors which are related to the act. 

Was my argument correct? What are your thoughts upon this?",1,1581586245,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f37iik/realizing_that_an_act_is_immoral_does_not/,philosophy,1

f2nw33,MINDFULLYONE,The domination of victim mentality," There’s an epidemic spreading across the United States, and it’s perhaps the most dangerous epidemic there could be; a socio-cultural and identity epidemic. This epidemic is the spread of group-think victim mentality. We get it okay? Not a single person can decide where they are born or what conscious mind they are allowed to inhabit or what situations happen TO them. But to fall into the mindset of victimhood is to fall into a hole that can never be escaped. Yes, I am ENTIRELY sure that the entire sum of human existence is out to get you, and even if it is, what do you hope to gain from playing the victim card? Do you want sympathy, do you want love, or do you just want everything you’re lacking in your life to magically come to you because you’re too busy blaming life for the personal atrocities you now endure. It’s far easier to recede into the recesses of the darkness and hide under the umbrella of oppression than to face the opposition and tackle life head on. And what’s even worse about this victim mentality is the group thought aspect. You get punched in the face for no reason; a classic bully. You blame that person initially and then after repeated offenses you face your fears and you deal with the problem YOURSELF; nobody can solve your problems but you, because nobody is you. Where society recently has been going wrong, is that the person being punched blames EVERYONE who even remotely resembles the bully for their pain. Do you even realize how detrimental that is? Nothing can ever be accomplished if you fight blame with blame.  

How do you progress in this day and age when there's an impenetrable wall being built on victim mentality.",1,1581494437,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f2nw33/the_domination_of_victim_mentality/,philosophy,1

f2klc8,Tyler3095,People who seek to be happy all the time are destined for misery.,"Weird subject but it pertains to a recent conversation I had with my buddy. The mindset of needing to be happy or doing something exciting all the time is ultimately a bad way to go about life. I think of life much like the sin wave of a heart beat. A sin wave contains highs and lows and ultimately meet in the middle. You can’t have a high without a low.

With the onset of social media like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, the amount of people experiencing FOMO increased dramatically. That’s because they showcase the highs of their life and not the lows. This causes people to compare their lives with others and feel bad about themselves.  Consider when you ask someone “how are you” and they respond with good automatically. Rarely would you have someone respond with something anything other than the word good. That’s because we attempt to convince people that we don’t go through hardships and have times when we are down.

f2czvb,reap_rl,Corruption at the Core,"Hello. My name is reap. At the point of writing this I am 19 years old. I'm from Germany. This is my philosophical theory. 
I'll try to make it short for the people with fucked up attention spans (like me). 
As most of you probably know, our species developed a natural disposition to egoism as an evolutionary advantage. 
I believe that in any type of political system currently known to us, this leads to corruption, which leads to self-destruction of the system itself. 
How? 
Basically, any type of political system currently known to us includes people with more power than other people. Because of the natural human trait of egoism, people with more power will at some point always fall to corruption, simply because they can - no one can stop them if there's no one with more power. And if there is someone with more power, they will fall to corruption for the same reason. 
That is why I believe that currently, there is no political system that could work for us - there are always power dynamics, which means there is always corruption, which inevitably leads to oppression and exploitation of the people with less power and eventually self-destruction of the system. 
I believe that our main concern as humanity should be to find a way to get rid of that natural human trait of egoism, that tendency to almost always eventually fall to corruption. We need to fundamentally change the psychology of the human species if we want to make a political system work for us without any oppression, corruption, exploitation or misuse of power. 
So in conclusion, fix human nature first, then worry about finding the most optimal political system. Of course, we should still try to make society as fair as possible while we work on fixing human nature tho. 
That's it. Thank you for reading.",1,1581447382,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f2czvb/corruption_at_the_core/,philosophy,1

Something so beautiful and pure can shape your entire existence, and with the same respect, hold the power to absolutely destroy it. 

I often wonder if the ones that end up staying with their fist love longterm...do they feel that same feeling throughout. Does it fade or change with the seasons...does it dim out or perhaps blossom even more?? 

See for me, I wasn’t given a choice, I was left. The only choice I had, was how I was going to recover...and it was a tough one to get through thats for sure. Some days I wished I had never even met him so I wouldn’t have to deal with the pain. It was a cycle of different emotions until I processed and unraveled each one a little bit at a time. Healing is the most confusing part, just when you thing you’re over it BOOM u get smacked upside the head until you find yourself repeating the same cycle. In the end though, I always come to the same conclusion...I’m thankful for the experience and wouldn’t trade it for anything else. 

Question is...do we ever get over our first loves..or do we just burry the love in a dark corner somewhere inside of our hearts?

f22wh3,throwaway_gyyy,I think I’m a solipsist of sorts,"I currently believe that there is only one conscious being, but I also think that you, and every other complex enough life form is conscious. My conclusion is that basically we (or I?) am one person whose consciousness is distributed across a multitude of substrates.

I have what I think are very powerful arguments for this conclusion, but I haven’t told anyone about my pet theory. I simply fear just how crazy I’d sound to them.

Anyways, I’m sure some other philosophers have come up with this or defended this position. Maybe someone from the east? I’d love to hear any suggested readings, because my thoughts on this are entirely something I’ve come up with on me own. In fact, I first came up with this when I was a 7-year-old. I had just learned about the concept of “God” at church, and I figured God was lonely, so he pretended to be a lot of people, and that’s who we are...and that’s what we call creation. Anyways when I was a kid the idea scared me shitless so I didn’t return to it until later in my adult life.

Now I’m pretty irreligious and have read a lot on the hard problem of conscienceness and books on neuroscience...especially split brain patients.

One thing about this sort of universal-solipsism is that it seems to ground morality objectively (at least have a better shot at doing so than other philosophies)...but that would be another discussion.

f1v017,CreepyWritingPrompt,Request: Formal way for looking at quality of an intervention,"Been thinking a lot about quality/purity of an intervention, as applied to psychotherapy, managing organizations, control systems.
Concrete example: asking someone with depression to do 10 jumping jacks every morning can be considered a ""low quality"" intervention; observing the desired effect (less depression) is hard to attribute to the intervention, given that compliance is required, and the person actually doing the jumping jacks could be indicative of another factor, rather than causal of improvement; theres no clear way to tease it apart and rate the quality of the intervention.
On the other end of the scale, grabbing someone off the street and cutting their head off is a relatively high quality intervention - the goal effect is less likely to be an indicator of the person's current state, and quite obviously a result of the intervention. Although its still not perfect - a person may be able to escape or not, depending on their current state (are they tired, are they depressed).

This are extreme examples, but i hope they get across what i am asking about; is there some formal system for talking about the quality of interventions in this sense?

f1rbri,The_Milesian,"Any recommendations for literature on ""with great power comes great responsibility""","Hey fellow redditors,  
I am currently writing my master thesis in Philosophy, and I could use some of your recommendations on philosophical literature regarding the Peter Parker principle of ""with great power comes great responsibility"".   
   The title of my paper is ""Ought Superman be supergood?"" and my focus is on whether moral obligations scale with abilities, in the sense of whether it is justified that we demand more of superhumans than we do of ""normal"" humans. My specific case is Superman, but I use other superheroes and stories to make points too. Superman in particular I find interesting because his powers are there by birth (not considering the effects of puberty and yellow sunlight on Kryptonian physiology) and aren't an accident in the same way that Spider-Man's powers are.  
Could we demand more of Superman than what we demand of each other, since he actually is able to make more of an influence in regards to good deeds, than most of us are? Is it also justified that we actually demand more of Superman than what he is currently doing with his powers? He saves lives, combats evil and is an all-around good guy, but would it be a better use of his powers if Superman became President or world leader? (Here I am inclined to say yes, especially considering how close Superman could be to my reading of Hobbes' Leviathan) Should we demand that people like Superman expand their heroic scope to also include politics?  
   I am already looking at the field of distributive justice, ought-implies-can and so on, but I'd kindly take any recommendations on literature that you feel is relevant.

My experiences thus far is even though I feel balanced, I'm seen as very different, not clear and not a woman's man but a true friend. Not only once or twice but constantly. I then notice a lot of men exclaiming their purpose in life like 'be a great writer, Grammy award winning musician or lawyer' and it's attractive to women.

We are god theory,

Basically we all started as one thing therefore we are all “pneuma” and we will forever expand out in infinite directions of space and time.  Spiraling out as the fibinacci sequence shows for eternity.

f1cfxx,Almat12,"Even in the worst, there is something funny"," 

1. Cupid is a squint sniper
2. Imagination is diving into the bottomless depths of madness.
3. A  person is not a person, but only another figure. Look at your prison   number. These are not numbers on the shirt, but your name.
4. Sleep is a unique museum of our past, present, and future. In which there is a library that stores unique knowledge.
5. Civilization is when a wild wolf becomes an obedient dog of the system.
6. A person does not want to please people, he wants to tease them.
7. Laziness is an adverse reaction to the artificial system of society.
8. Many people have a love with late ignition.
9. Conclusions  - these are human tests, that is, blood, urine and feces.  They give  out a piece of paper that shows which psychological diseases  you are  sick with.
10. The corpse of truth, is located somewhere at the bottom of the ocean.
11. Because of slang, jargon and swear words. Words will turn into sounds and letters.
12. No matter how much you read, it is important how much you understand.
13. The enemy rules you with your anger.
14. The gloom of loneliness will give either holiness or madness.
15. Love is the blues of sincere feelings. Awakening in reality something paranormal, something supernatural.
16. Madness is when garbage recycling in the head breaks down.
17. Never confuse truth with opinion.
18. Everyone is drunk by his own madness.
19. If  people are directed at you: resentment, envy, causticity, sarcasm,   anger, aggression, hatred, revenge, rage - know that all this is the   sympathy of people, this does not mean that you are a bad person, just   very attractive personality.
20. A love couple who is able to constantly forgive each other is doomed to become the happiest couple in the world.
21. Never listen, and never react to someone who does not know and does not understand you.
22. Dear  ladies, if your friend advises you to walk, enjoy life, pursue a   career, and not think about the feelings of the male? So, she wishes   you happy loneliness in middle and old age.
23. Even in the worst, there is something funny.
24. We die exactly as much as the world ceases to be needed.

f1c7j5,Almat12,Regress is a speedometer of stupidity," 1. Plush greed There are so many mechanical hypocritical toys (people)  in this two-faced world of hypocritical egoism. They are cute and  obedient from the outside, programmed to serve, but at the same time  completely soulless from the inside.  
2. Order and chaos Order is a  blank canvas, and chaos is the bright colors of despair. They depict  suffering, unless of course suffering can be called beautiful knowledge  that gives the catharsis of awareness from experience.  
3. Nature  leads us to death. Nature is a great manager with an organizer of  instincts in his hands, where all human vices and internal shortcomings  are. It controls the cyclical nature of the universal calendar leading  us to death, the same thing happened with previous races living on our  earth. Evolution leading to a logical conclusion from our madness and  despair, to the decline of mankind. But nature cannot destroy a  civilization that has abandoned the great self-deception of egoism,  which will be the main cause of human death. Only that race that will  abandon its own egoism will absorb the humanism of selfless nobleness  where literally every life will be appreciated, can deceive nature  itself and experience the new dawn of awareness, namely immortality in  eternity. It must be understood that death is the best helper of nature;  it is just a gardener who does not allow the Garden of Eden to  overgrow. But thanks to the unity of mankind, we also know other gardens  in other worlds.  
4. Humor is a very funny depression, bright, colorful pessimism.  
5. Fear is the younger brother of death. Fear is constantly trying to surpass his older brother.  
7.  Good and love is an interdimensional multidimensional spatial form of  philosophy outside of time; it is a state of harmony in eternity, the  key to all worlds and inner worlds of people, both external and hidden.  With this vision of thinking, you see everything at once, simultaneously  deeply and from above, you see all the forms of time in one palm.  
8. Lips and tongue are three drills. A smile from a drill grinds any evil face.  
9.  Techno world Any madness can be called progress. Meat, blood and bones  are mixed with high technology, the spirit of humanity will dissolve in  cold metal. The imagination of people is becoming more and more  terrible, bodymodification shows our ugly entities turned inside out,  good with evil, how difficult the interweaving of DNA from which people  slowly and painfully go crazy, self-destruction is only an indifference  to eternity that destroys this complex chain. The ranks of restless  souls wandering the earth will replenish. Choose the side of goodness  and light, selfless nobleness, true love and sincere friendship and you  will thank yourself for all eternity, only conscience will lead you to  paradise.  
10. Love outside the dimension Love is peace and tenderness  of the light of souls, the unity of tenderness. From love you fall into  a gap in space and time, love outside the dimension is a very special  space for two lovers in ordinary reality.  
11. Time is chess. Time and  space is a chessboard, here pawns are your enemies, more important  pieces are your internal flaws and vices. There are millions of options  for the moves of your will that show completely different forms of the  future. Remember that each of your moves reflects your form of the  future in life, but also after death. Make your fate check and  checkmate.  
12. Pseudo-science All of these politicized  pseudo-theories and hypotheses, pseudo-facts that brazenly lie, starting  their speech with the words: few people know. They turn science into an  absurdity, and they thereby erase your memory in this confusion,  constantly correcting it, they rob you of the past, plunging it into a  false future.  
13. On the body of pessimism, the sound dynamics of truth are everywhere.  
14.  Take care of children. Children are eggs on their backs that hatch and  fall to the ground only twenty years later. An adult comes out of an egg  and becomes a new parent.  
15. A person who has the will, holds in  his hands a cosmo-blaster similar to a bazooka, which is directly  connected to his back, is charged with the strength of the charge of  spirit. He shoots an energy ray, which is charged by his strength of  mind. Your fortitude is your weapon against a destructive enemy named  laziness.  
16. Man is a portal. Man is a portal to another world, the  inner world of a person. He doesn’t let everyone in it and sometimes  releases his ideas into the outside world. The heart, mind and soul are  portals to the inner world.  
17. Be a living embodiment of optimism  that holds in your hands a laser blaster that is directly connected to  his body, charges the weapon with optimism and shoots sad people with a  charge of fun and joy. Sometimes it explodes like thermonuclear  optimism, spreading a wave of positive throughout the city, and  self-restores in a few seconds.  
18. Seven mirrors on an asteroid.  Seven broken mirrors on an asteroid that moves around the sun. A piece  of land of a forgotten civilization. In these mirrors there were seven  alternative human and alien worlds, having passed through all the worlds  you are farther and farther away from reality. But reality is what the  universe itself created, it is something that was not artificially  created for the benefit of empty illusions. If the world is full of  illusions, then the mirror reflects these illusions. The real world  shines like sunlight through all these mirrors.  
19. Atrocious cinema  We see how on television some animals kill others, and the cameraman  filming this atrocity believes that it is impossible to interfere in the  affairs of nature. We see people being killed in movies or on  television, we sympathize, and then we don't care. Aliens and gods watch  how every day they kill people and animals and plants and they, like  that cameraman, think that they should not interfere in their affairs,  they like watching a movie, at first they sympathize, and then they  don’t care.  
20. A smile of cynicism Voiced by schizoid music coming  from broken toys. He crawled out of a big, stuffed toy, he personified  cynicism, he was a toy of society, his pumping, sociopathic, arrogant  smile of cynicism. Indifferently looking at the tears of the suffering. A  smile infectiously pulls evil smiles on everyone, thereby people make  each other worse, worse and worse. A smile of a cynic, in his hands are  the deadly, comical trump cards of deceit.  
21. Heroes among traitors  Sometimes a snow globe, that is, our world, shakes and shakes. This is a  periodic end of the world, or simply war. This is only necessary in  order to see among the chaos of true heroes among traitors.  
22.  Sometimes opinion turns into a sect. Opinion is selfish and rarely has  any connection with the truth. Opinion is a branded mask of personality,  a source of opinion that is worn by thousands and thousands of naive  individuals, symbolically turning into itself. A selfish opinion hides  in a hypothesis, gaining an army of supporters, authority turns a  hypothesis into a theory, and time turns a theory into a pseudo fact.  Sometimes opinion turns into a sect, gaining an army of adept marketers,  plunging society into an even worse form of delusion and confusion.  While truth has no form of selfishness, it thinks of everyone, it is a  source of good and light. Humanity will die due to selfish opinions  serving only for elite units.  
23. The Internet spoils eyesight and  the brain. The time spent on the Internet and computer games is an empty  spent vision that is useful in old age. Better to read books, they do  not destroy vision and give deep knowledge, it is knowledge that  distinguishes us from animals. Instead of mania stupidity of the  Internet, you will have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. This is  better than the Internet. I hope you understand this until your vision  has finally deteriorated into a blank. One of the highest values ​​is  awareness from knowledge, if you have learned a lot from the knowledge  you have gained from life or books, then you have lived your life for  good reason.  
24. The keys to the higher worlds The knowledge of world  religions is just four keys to a higher form of awareness, they will  open the gates to the higher worlds, you just need to choose one of  these keys to evolve.  
25. Lyrical aesthetics In reality, all people  are beautiful in appearance and there are no ugly people at all, since  this is a vital, lyrical aesthetics of appearance, which has a special  coloring of romance, it is beautiful because it is true, without any  illusions, it is a form of aesthetics from which people wean because of  technocratization of society.  
26. The smile of the insight The smile  of awareness, its edges pierce the fabric of reality and reveal what is  hidden from view, the black humor of reality devoid of all hypocrisy.  
27. The truth about man. Man is very beautiful only under a certain coverage of the truth and situation in life.  
28.  Refers to the whole of humanity, people will become people only when  they give up their own egoism. Only then will we cease to be part of the  animal world, and will evolve into representatives of a higher race.  
29. People are like meteorites that leave scars of selfishness on a common planet earth.  
30.  Forgiving is much more profitable than taking revenge. Clinical death  is a rebirth of the mind only for units, either a hero or a bastard  returns from hell. If you want a spoiler, hell does not change people  there, the environment is not suitable for changes for the better. And  here is the information from your dreams, the villains of your life are  those who you didn’t like in your past life, you can fight many lives  with them and you don’t suspect about it, and God only expects a truce  from both of you, and the lesson in life is not to pay attention and  forgive the bastards, let them into paradise, and then in the next life  they will become friends or will not touch at all. And if you do not  forgive, they will return from hell even more evil and will again spoil  your life. So goodbye and do not pay attention, for the sake of your own  psyche.  
31. Fate controls a person using a game joystick.  
32.  Fear is meaningless. Fear is like falling into the tunnel of  inevitability, it is excitement and the nervous laugh of fearlessness,  excitement until the heart stops. Having known the bottom of the abyss,  you understand that there is nothing to fear during a sinful life,  because everything is like in a dream of the illusions of materialism,  everything is temporary. They are only afraid of what will happen after  death, because everything is eternal there and everything is real.  
33.  Fate is a fictional alter of the ego of humanity Despondency, voiced by  depressive jazz, which has slightly schizoid melodies, vile moments of  life. It’s like an almost smoked cigarette that you crush with a shoe,  almost completely smoked psyche, an almost drunk soul with the greedily  lustful hedonism of this world, a lonely soul in the midst of  hypocritical selfishness. You see neon signs of morally decaying cities  illuminating the darkness of egoism, they are like guiding threads of  lascivious lost souls in which conscience has rotted and only despair  remains. Here, people often cheat on each other at heart; they are just  sex toys of lust. Here, madness becomes harmlessly the norm. They do not  understand that the second name of death is saving, all that death  offers is to save literally on everything. Here every year they wait for  the end of the world, it seems to them that fate has pointed a gun at  mankind, and wonders if there is a bullet there or not, but mankind is  crazy, in fact, it has aimed a gun at itself, and fate is a fictional  alter ego.  
34. Because love is higher than sex. The more you love a  girl, the less you want sex with her. You only want to hug your soul,  love with your heart and kiss her lips and cheeks. Because love is  higher than sex.  
35. Nobleness is always the right answer in difficult life tests.  
36. Nature has launched a mechanism for the destruction of humanity  
38.  Love is a heart shining with sunlight, in the shape of a golden gem  like a big diamond for the whole hand, in the shape of a heart drops of  genuine love dripping from it that can breathe life into any life form.  
39.  Faith is oxygen. Faith is invulnerability; it is nourished by  stubbornness, motivation itself and an endless stream of will. His body  is mortal, but the spirit of faith cannot be killed. Faith is the oxygen  that feeds the brain, helping it think sensibly.  
40. True love is a  special invisible thread consisting of common bright memories, because  it is pleasant memories that strengthen this thread of love, which  intensifies over the years. No knives and axes of conflict, resentment  or guilt can destroy it, because your love is much more valuable than  all this unnecessary garbage. This thread grows, becomes stronger and  stronger, turns two people into one full-fledged person.  
41. Spirit  of love. When love dies, it is as if a person has died, spirit comes out  of his body, this spirit is memory, boredom, memory. This is a life of  love after parting, as if life after death. This spirit wanders in your  mind, soul and heart.  
 42. Love is the highest form of thinking in  the universe. Love is the highest form of thinking in the universe. It  is higher than any form of appearance and character, higher than money,  higher than Nazism racism, higher sexism and feminism, higher and more  valuable than any problems, higher than any insults and guilt, above all  earthly, material values. Love is the thinking and life of the spirit,  not the body, in any world, dimension, universe, timeless. Since the  spirit is directly connected with the heart, this constitutes the true  shape of the body, thereby you see much more and deeper than the animal  vision of the materialist, atheist. Love is when you sacrifice your  ideals, dreams for the sake of your loved one because you value and love  this person much more than anything in the world, because your soulmate  and your children are your highest value in the universe.  
43. The  smile of the hypocrite is a half-face mask from a broken mirror which  reflects tens of hundreds of false smiles of him and those who stand and  stood in front of him.  
44. Ego orgasm. Complimenting a girl is like  you masturbating her vagina in various ways, bringing to an ego an  orgasm of love. The more orgasms the deeper you penetrate her bosom of  love.  
46. ​​The ghosts of the present Sometimes, any of us feels like  a ghost, you seem to be among people, but almost no one notices you,  you are among a crowd of people and you are as if dead to them, as if in  a paranormal video about ghosts. You are alone and you seem to merge  together with reality, gradually disappearing into it.  
47. A  hypocrite does not have a face at all. He wears thousands of sneaky  masks, because he has many connections and acquaintances, but he has no  true friends, he has no personality, no character, only charisma and  acting, he can be anyone and anything, but he completely forgot his true  self.  
48. What mankind does to itself is suicidal cannibalism.  
49.  Revenge is meaningless and unprofitable If some person really shit in  your psyche and soul very well and considers himself right. So think  very well whether it is because of him or her that you spoil your karma,  because God is looking at you, think very well he has already spoiled  his karma and now non-verbally encourages you to spoil your karma,  thereby you give him comfort that you are no better than him . After  all, in your next life you will live worse because of your revenge and  again you will see him or her and everything will start again. Just  don't answer him or her, get out of the karmic circle of revenge.  
50.  If you see clearly, you are already a light bulb; you illuminate the  darkness of ignorance. Light bulbs include where there is no light of  science, philosophy and culture. But this light is artificial, because  it is completely composed of theories, there are almost no facts in it.  Light for the blind who still do not understand anything.  
51. Time is  just a record. If there is a concept of future time, then we live in  the past, there is no concept of present time, there is only our current  time for us. Imagine that the time periods of the past, present, and  future as cassette disks of a tape recorder of the 20th century, we are  imprisoned in a time loop from which we physically can not get out as we  age. Your life is a tape recording of audio or video as you like, there  is no fate, everything is decided by the higher forces that work on the  time script.  
52. Intelligence is an open path to hundreds, thousands of different dimensions - these are variations of thinking.  
 53. Selfish minds in cells. Cells in your smiles and eyes.  
54.  People strive for anarchy in their own psyche, they go to the mind of a  spoiled child, who supposedly can do anything, when people come to this  they will be extremely vulnerable and will see a high mortality rate.  
 55. Cities of the future under a dome, they are isolated from reality, they breathe the illusions of egoism.  
56.  A man looks like a knife, one side strokes, while the other side of the  personality, ha ha ha, you understand. Man is a brilliant  psychological, mental weapon that must be in the hands of good against  the forces of evil.  
57. A man is a llama who bears the burdens of  life, while his wife owns a llama. and drags him to the top of the  mountain of success.  
58. A lazy person looks so much like a square ball.  
59.  How to trick your brain Advice for bodybuilders, everyone is sure that  during training everyone should be focused on training, but you feel  your heart and breathing tighten. But there is one secret from me when  you do the exercise, put a photo next to what sympathizes or emotion in  you, maybe this photo of your beloved girl can be a beautiful view of  nature, at your discretion, and you yourself won’t notice how you will  do more repetitions because you look at a photo or video and your brain  is distracted, it’s as if it’s turned off and you almost don’t feel  tired, just a slight burning sensation in your muscles.  
60. Life is not a uniformly lit road.  
61. At the beginning of life, you smile with fear. In the middle and at the end, you smile and laugh with hatred.  
62. Thinking is just glass showing the world around or the inside, but among fools it is tightly tinted.  
63.  Blood must be constantly driven from the brain (reading) to the muscles  (bodybuilding) from there to the penis (sex and practice penis  enlargement). Blood increases the volume of all three of these sections  of the body. Blood stores experience, information that goes into the  soul, into genes, blood gives strength to posterity, all this will come  in handy in the next life. Blood makes it possible to become stronger  and more your own problems and then your problems will be afraid of you.  
64.  Just an idea: A motivating lesson. All schools and universities need a  motivating lesson. In which psychologists will motivate learning to  show, explain what will happen to them if they do not study, show  today's vacancies and opportunities, universities and organizations. You  need to work with teenagers and students and they will understand who  to become.  
66. Regression is a speedometer of stupidity, the speed of  which is just off the charts in developed countries. In them regress  mixed up progress.  
67. Love is when you have lived your whole life  with your man. You find after death in paradise or in hell and spend  eternity with this person, with this person eternity as a happy moment.  
68.  Love is when you give up your own egoism and take that very person into  your life and you understand that you are not alone in the whole  universe.  
69. Opinion, theory and hypothesis - it's like a water  attraction surfing, how long you stay on the board is only a matter of  time, and when you fall you will be replaced by another surfer.  
71.  All fictional characters, mascots of sports teams, animators in costumes  of famous characters, cosplay, they all fight for you, for your love,  like hummingbirds hover around your head, they want to take the essence  of life from you. All of them distract from life itself.  
72. Orgasms of love. The first orgasm because of lust, the second orgasm because of love, the third because of passion.  
73.  Success in bodybuilding is not a show off, but a competent distribution  of strength and energy. Constantly make friends at a gas station of  motivation, on fuel of desire.  
74. Learn to love Parrots, dogs, cats,  hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, they are all great simulators of  tenderness, they teach kindness and love. Train, learn from them to be  gentle and sweet, sensitive, caring, faithful, all this will help you in  your relationship with the opposite sex. Give your soulmate as often as  possible affectionate, kiss, hug, love soul and heart, and only then  genitals.  
75. Love is like a wind tunnel where in a personal intimate space, from feelings you soar above the ground.  
76. Unfortunately, relationships like karting, it is important for people not to act together, leadership is important here.  
77. Understanding as a gas burner, combines any character.  
79. Truth is devoid of temptation.  
80.  Your love is a gift from God for humanity. If your love is stronger  than all the dark feelings on earth, then you are much stronger than  more than one billion people.  
81. A woman is a veil of mystery, a  screen of temptation, an unfinished, unsolved love detective. All this  leads to an uncharted, but infinitely new, helps to uncover in yourself  what I had not previously suspected.  
82. A smile of awareness  
A  man between anger and despondency, illuminates both sides with selfless  nobility. A thought emerges from the depths, or goes into the depths,  into dreams, into unconsciousness, where there are only fears, desires,  and memories. The head is connected with the other world, the pillar of  the beam around which thoughts move, your mind opens thousands of  dimensions into alternative dimensions of the imagination. A smile will  reveal the true self, a smile will open the bridge to it. A crazy smile  stretches to the floor, it is like a cell of the soul, the edges of the  lips are connected with portals to the other world, they are also smiles  twisted into spirals, gas of laughter comes out through the teeth, in  the smile a whole universe of awareness, a smile digging into other  smiles, connecting them together and stretching them out. Other smiling  personalities burst from the face while in a special state of mind. In  the head, the third eye of the suspects of all traitors squinted,  electric wires connected to the head connected with reality, with its  whisper. In a giant smile opening up to the world, a smiling powerful  force lurks smiling eyes of the bright side of the person. The body and  soul are torn and there are crazy smiles too, the body opens, and there  is a portal to the wonderful world. A smile sometimes coils into a  spiral of thoughts, leaving a person in himself, tearing themselves away  from external values, plunging into spirituality, and then spinning  around him, immersing himself in his own self. Part of the body is a  cloak in which other forms of mood are hidden. The body has ten smiling  sneak tails sent by the dark side of the person. There is a wired smile  in the body that wants to say a lot, it is in the back of the head and  there is a bag that accumulates laughter and absorbs someone else's.

f13phn,Voizebt,There's no mind body problem,"I know this is crazy but hear me out. 

I don't think there's any mind-body problem. I just think it's a failure of early intellectuals to extrapolate that what's true of their mind is true of everyone else. 

And we're all just bodies and brains and a bunch of atoms. The universe is physically real because even if you kill all humans life still continues. Evolution continues as long as there's more than 2 organisms competing to optimizing for safety.

And that error to see beyond ourselves is why those blindly biased male men who thought of themselves superior that others is why. Smart men ended up up in churches because they didn't want families. Maybe they kept the god thing and that tainted the dualism debates before states split from the church. Idk

And religion maybe is correct if you replace the forbidden fruit in the Bible with psychedelic mushrooms. Reincarnation is just you breaking down into the larger soup of atoms that's the universe. Your 20W (not sure this is correct but the electricity your brain synapses) isn't lost so energy created not destroyed. 

The matter might reorganize as a star a plant etc who knows. Maybe that's the reincarnation stuff is all about. And that solves Fermi's paradox. Life and stuff just arises from physical reactions and processes. We can explain why life is sustained by purely  scientific cosmological events...the thing that hit us and formed the moon.

Gravity is just the weight of everything. Kind of like how one grain of sand weighs nothing but a lorry is alot. And there's more stars than the sand....all that mass of fundamental particles has too add up in larger scales. Idk it just makes sense. 

Cause the problem with the world is simply half the world is scientific and the other holds on to fundamental religion but we're all humans and biologically same. Missing link between us and apes is just gradual optimization from when we hacked wheat (Yuval Hararis's Sapiens theory). 

We die, decay and the majority is simply forgetten. There's no mind-body problem cause without humans the universe is just as physically real and all animals exist. It's that obvious to me idk.


I'm African and in a uni in Canada and this is so obvious to me as I was taking a class on implicit biases.

Maybe some people figure this and are ""enlightened"" and warn us about the evils of other men so we don't kill ourselves. And their stories stuck to be literal as environmental context was lost over time.  

But some people figure this out (I have a feeling Elon Musk is one) and try steer us. As long as there's one person who knows better we'll all be fine eventually. Unless we close the game of life for ourselves with climate change, or wealthier people go off into space. Obviously I'm agnostic but I think that's what Revelations is about. 

It always sounded like some ancient Greek guy's trip 🤷🏾‍♂️. Anyways this is a philosophy sub and I didn't know this was thing until recently so let me know what you think",2,1581223111,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f13phn/theres_no_mind_body_problem/,philosophy,1
f13o45,nathaniscashmoney,The Silicon Neuron - A thought experiment on the possibility of artificial consciousness,"Neurons are the cells that make up our brain, and they are entities which, like everything else in the universe, follow natural, physical laws.  Because the neuron operates in mechanical, replicable ways, there is no clear reason why given the right technology and resources we could not create a device that functions precisely like a neuron—down to the last molecular intricacies. The neuron is computational in nature, so it is plausible to imagine that we might one day create something like a “silicon neuron,” an electrical device whose functioning is indistinguishable from that of a biological neuron. 

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps a thousand years from now, some future inventor creates a silicon neuron as it has just been described. To test its functionality, she conducts single-neuron replacements on willing, human participants and finds that the replacements are completely uneventful in terms of neural activity—the transaction goes smoothly and it remains business as usual in the brain.  After further research and development, the inventor then creates a nanobot capable of performing these neuron replacements quickly, safely, and reliably. She programs the device to replace all the neurons in her brain with silicon neurons in a piecemeal fashion, switching neurons out one by one. After implanting the device in herself, there are at least two possibilities:

1. The nature of conscious experience for the inventor does not change at all, and she continues to live her life completely unaffected by the replacement. Her brain will eventually be outsourced from a biological substrate to one of silicon, but the inventor’s conscious experience will be completely preserved.
2. The nature of conscious experience for the inventor does change in significant ways. Although the interactions in the inventor’s brain are preserved, each neuron replacement is effectively one billionth of a step toward the termination of her conscious experience

I'm interested to hear from the community about what they think would happen and any other potential implications that stem from these two cases.

P.S. This is an ultra-abridged version of a paper I wrote, which is pinned on my twitter  [https://twitter.com/bignateisme](https://twitter.com/bignateisme). I explore the implications/rationale behind both possibilities.",1,1581222900,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f13o45/the_silicon_neuron_a_thought_experiment_on_the/,philosophy,1
f13ma5,dbeltres962,"I don’t know anything, it feels incredible"," 
The most discerning thing to uncover about yourself, is that the one thing you thought you knew most, you didn’t know at all. People take pride in what they know. What is known is either true or untrue. Right or wrong.
When the thing you thought you knew most, you realize you don’t know at all, you can’t tell what’s true or untrue. You can’t tell what’s right or wrong. You don’t know.
Now, once you know that the thing you thought you knew you don’t know, then what.
Well, you know that you don’t know.  You don’t know, that’s true, that’s right. What can I do with that.
 
I don’t know.

I don’t know what to think. If I don’t know, I feel. It hard though. What I feel, feels right. What I know, I can’t feel. What I feel is right. Its true.

f13l0q,RhymeToReason,𝘼𝙙𝙙𝙞𝙘𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙏𝙤 𝘼𝙙𝙙𝙞𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨,"Hello, I hope that this can reach somebody who needs to hear it. 

I have spent much of my life focused on analysis. 
This has given me an incredibly deep urge to share and discuss what I encounter along this path. Yet I've never talked to anybody about it. So here I will leave this post, wherever it decides to go. 



I have noticed that our minds loves to find Addictions, we desire the ease and warmth of creating a habit. Essentially an unthinking place where the body is in an automatic state, doing actions done by either body or mind that have been done many times before. 
Enough times that when committing same repetitive thought or actions, if consciousness permits. 
If done enough we begin to enter our natural flow state, a state where we do not think, we just do or say automatically. In this way it is satisfying and comfortable for our brains to have the simple ease of doing something done enough times to ingrain itself within our deeper mind. 


Now the reason that I truly wish to write this is to talk of this next part...

Everyday I watch people act in the same ways. 

I see people.
Who do or say as a parent (or other humans) has done or repeated enough times to create a truth within that Humans head.
This has nothing to do with age, race or gender.
Everybody can fall to this.

In reality the only things that we truly believe in are only created by what were are told is true.

This is why when we are very young we believe everything we are told. This young our brains is in the Habit of believing because it is still learning about everything that this life has to offer. 

Psychology shows us that Humans personalities are partly sculpted around both our parents and the other people we live around. 
Of course, everything we do really is either for or against people, let us all be honest.

To break it down even further.

Everything we do is either based of our own habits or other people's habits. 

Now isn't that a funny thing to think about. 

If you aren't getting this let me create a visual example for us.

If every person is a piece of art yet to be drawn. Then the things that we do, say, think and hear become the picture of us. With a pencil we create our piece slowly but surely as we live our lives day by day.

We believe other people until we are shown not to. Be that parents or others. 

Both when we believe other people, and when we do not believe other people. 

We are creating a habit. For the next time and the next.

Essentially because it is too much work for our Brains to think deeply upon whether anything that is said by other humans is true or not.

A habit can be as simple as, telling yourself everyday that you're a loser. 
If said enough times (and remember that it is not about how many times it is said a day) just that is is said everyday. 

Our brains instinctively will lock onto that repitition. This is not a choice, our brains BIOLOGICALLY both want and need habits.

Habits create a relaxed state, the flow state, which in reality is a form of meditation. 

And yes those who meditate more often are more relaxed

This leads to the effect of people who are, ""simpler"" and ""stubborn"". We all have areas of life in which we ourselves are stubborn, and unwilling to change about. 

This is because all of us as Human Beings. 
With living Brains. 
Need Relaxing.

Because Relaxation is the opposite of stress.
Stress is what causes problems.


Now there's a few things you should have come to understand if you have made it this far...

1. Habits both help us and hurt us in more ways than I can describe.
2. Our Truths are created by the habits that are unconsciously chosen through repitition seen in other people's actions and our own. 
3. Truth is only what we believe as true. Things are not always as they seem.
3. Stress is what causes problems.


To tell you the truth, it is much healthier for ourselves to let habit takeover. 
To let repitition take hold and guide us easily by just repeating what we see and hear others do. 
To believe everything our parents have ever said. 

This is what the unthinking mind does, the ""simpler"" or ""stubborn"" person. Is actually someone who has either consciously or unconsciously chosen to let those things happen. By repeating what they see and hear in others, or even just what they believe to say. They reduce the total amount of stress on the brain. Which in turn creates a more constant state of RELAXATION. They more constantly are in a  meditative state when doing, saying, or thinking something that's been repeated by them.

To be clear a habit forms when committing a truth. 
For example, a habit can be a belief that every stranger will be rude as a first response, the habit will form out of a combination of the belief and the action. If a stranger approaches you and for example asks the time, if you respond rudely go find a clock, you are enforcing the fear that strangers will be rude by first believing that it will happen and second by creating a habit of keeping strangers away by being rude first. Removing a possible chance of ever meeting someone who instead responds with kindness.

This is a common self-destructive habit. 

I wrote this to try to help everyone understand that, you can change.

For the better.

And you can keep it that way. 

Don't let other people take away the feelings that you feel deep inside. 

Do not let our inherent need for things to be easier, get in the way of your happiness.


If you feel lonely dig deep inside yourself, think about what things you believe to be true that could lead to feeling lonely.

Think both about the habits you have that keep other people from knowing you, and the habits that other people use to keep people from knowing them. 

Try to understand that we are all looking for some way to be, some path to follow,
Something to believe in. 

We need to feel as if somebody understands us, or knows us. If you don't feel as if this is you. Wait until the day that you are truly alone and are in pain, in our darkest moments is when we most think upon how we truly want to be. 

Deep Down.

It is not a weakness to admit you have felt that feeling. 
The feeling when everything else goes quiet.

The feeling of needing to have someone by your side to understand your own singular pains. 
To know regardless of what you say, how you feel. 

Someone who is by your side not because of any other reason but for the fact that

YOU     ARE      YOU !!!

Someone who regardless of what happens stays by your side. 



It is hardest to be alone. 

That is why we try to create ways to convince ourselves that we don't need anybody else. That we are perfectly well off alone and that if we even let anyone in they would just hurt us.



If you still believe you are meant to be alone 

And that you would rather be addicted.

I would challenge you to change your habits of thought and action. To watch yourself carefully to see actively how you might be keeping yourself from being happy. 

Not to continue to think upon your loneliness or unhappiness.

But to use thinking as a way to counter the self-destructive habits we form.



When it comes down to it. Habits can either destroy you or save you. 

If you are 















Do not be fooled the overthinking mind is just as bad. They are just both ends of the same spectrum. The overthinking mind will create the deepest and most Painful of habits. I say painful because they are truly the hardest to break. 
Overthinkers will have a list in there head which outlines all of the reasons which something is true, 
Basically 
Reasons for yourself of why this habit was created 







The mind inside ourselves that we have yet to control, will create habits out of repitition by convincinourselves that it is infact true. By creating basically a list of truths.


With that list of truths (regardless if they are actually true) it will use that as backup to begin to enforce the belief that we are infact lonely.

Be it that we are a lonely person.

Or that we are a loser.

Or that we are pathetic. 

Or that we 

Or that we arent all beautiful in our own way.



Now of course, you can choose consciously to stop and think the next time you are at a decision point to either believe something that is said by someone else or thought by yourself. 

And this is what I have chosen to do,



Now for the example.
Think to yourself, Am  I  Lonely?

If so a belief that you are in fact lonely must come from someplace. This place is most often from a Habit created one way or the other. 

A Habit of loneliness.

This habit is usually created through thinking 


Think with me for a second, think about one single person. Somebody in your life who has truly made you feel different. Someone who's made you happy for whatever the reason. Somebody that you've loved or admired for only their beautiful, kind, funny, encouraging, loving, gracious, intelligent, interesting minds (or whatever the adjectives may be). 
Not for their bodies, or their money, or anything else. 
But for the minds held within that human form.

Imagine that there were hundreds of those magnificent Humans.

Imagine that they were scattered across the world 

Now Imagine that one of those People.

Felt Lonely.









I see people who have been hurt by People out in the world, out in Society. 
I have seen People act in ways that were in  completely opposition to how they truly felt. All out of some feelings towards what they had Seen, or what they had Heard.

The truth is when people are hurt they spend alot of time thinking upon what and why such a thing could have happened. 

This thinking creates a habit...

f129do,precursive,"James Marsh's efforts to reconcile science, reason, and his faith in 18th century Vermont","Transcribed this for some friends earlier, thought some of you all might enjoy the read, as well. Part of the story of James Marsh's 19th century efforts to reconcile science, reason, and his faith, as influenced by Samuel Coleridge and Immanuel Kant/Friedrich Schelling. Would love to discuss, if anyone is interested, as attempts to reconcile these things is one of my favorite pastimes, but been a while since I've done so, and just offering this as food if anyone's mind would like this flavor of snack (since I typed it out, anyway).

Menand, Louis. *The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America*. Burlington Vermont chapter, pages 244-246.

&gt; In James Marsh's time the name of Locke stood for two theories. The first theory was based on the belief that the mind is a blank slate written on by experience. We possess, according to this view, no innate ideas, virtually no mental contents that just automatically come with having minds. All our ideas derive from the world outside ourselves, to which we have no unmediated access, but which we experience through the senses in the form of images and impressions. This is empiricism. The second theory associated with Locke was based on the belief that societies are composed of autonomous individuals who establish governments in order to protect their natural rights, which include the right to rebel against tyrannical regimes. This is liberal individualism, the philosophic foundation of the Declaration of Independence, a document drafted, of course, by Jefferson. In Lockean thinking, human beings are essentially rights bearing ciphers.

&gt; Like Newtonian physics, Lockean philosophy is atomistic: it imagines everything as a concatenation of independent entities. In the Lockean theory of knowledge, mental contents are aggregations of discrete items of sense data linked by chains of associations; in the Lockean theory of politics, social groups are aggregations of autonomous individuals linked by voluntary and revocable contractual bonds. These are theories that contemplate no whole greater than the sum of its parts. Also like Newtonian physics, Lockean empiricism explains everything as a matter of cause and effect. Apart from the possibility of a start-up god, a divinity who winds the universe's clock, it seems to leave no room for the supernatural (that which we cannot know through the senses) or for the miraculous (the uncaused cause).

&gt; Marsh's distaste for atomistic thinking had two dimensions. One was political. He rejected the idea that societies are associations of already fully realized individuals. He believed, on the contrary, that selves can be realized only in and through communities, and he thought the distinction implicit in Lockean political theory between ""the individual"" and ""the state"" was therefore insupportable. What individuates individuals, what enables then to realize themselves as individuals, is their role within a group. Outside of the group, they have no identity.

&gt; Marsh's second objection was religious. Marsh was an evangelical Christian. He had taken Jesus as his savior during a religious revival in Hanover when he was a Dartmouth student, and he refused to accept the divorce empiricism seemed to mandate between matters of philosophy and matters of faith

&gt; It was common in the nineteenth century to make modern science and philosophy compatible with Christian belief by pronouncing questions of faith to be, by their nature, unprovable. The argument was that although the truth of religious belief cannot be established empirically (by scientific observation) or rationally (by philosophic argument), it does not follow that faith is untenable. It simply means that science and philosophy have to do only with the world we can see and touch, the world of phenomena; about things of the spirit, they can properly have nothing to say. Marsh refused to adhere to this decorum, and it became the quest of his short life to find a philosophy on all fours with evangelical Christianity.

&gt; He found it (or he thought he found it) in the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Coleridge, when Marsh took him up, was regarded as a distinguished poet with an unfortunate taste for German metaphysics. He was not esteemed as a thinker. But in 1829 Marsh published an edition of Coleridge's *Aids to Reflection*, to which he contributed a long introduction announcing that Coleridge had proved that Christianity is indeed consistent with philosophy --- that (in Marsh's words) ""so far from being irrational, Christian faith is the perfection of reason."" It makes no sense, Marsh argued, to have two systems of belief - a philosophic system for natural things and a theological system for spiritual things. ""We cannot, as rational beings, believe a proposition on the grounds of reason, and deny it on the authority of revelation,"" he insisted. ""We cannot believe a proposition in philosophy, and deny the same proposition in theology."" We need a single system, and Coleridge had produced one. He had rescued evangelicalism from superstition. He had provided rational grounds for believing in the supernatural agency of Jesus Christ.

&gt; Coleridge had accomplished this by the trick of looking inward instead of outward. Looking outward onto the phenomenal world, which is where the empiricist looks, we find no justification for faith because faith does not justify itself by the evidence of the senses; all the evidence of the senses tells us (as far as Locke's successor David Hume had seemed to show) is that the universe is just one phenomenal event after another. Faith justifies itself instead by the evidence of introspection - the evidence that we gather by looking into our own minds and reflecting on the laws of our being. For we do have innate ideas, mental contents that automatically come with being human, and we find in those a consistency and harmony missing from the fallen world we know through the sense - and thus discover a rational basis for faith.

&gt; This is an echo of Plato's distinction between an inconstant world of appearance, apprehended by the senses, and an eternal world of ideal forms, apprehended by the intellect. Coleridge had read Plato and the Neoplatonic British writers of the seventeenth century (as had Marsh) with enthusiasm; but he had another source as well. This was the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, whom he understood (somehat erroneously) to have made a distinction between ""understanding"", defined as the mental faculty that perceives empirical particulars, and ""reason"", the mental faculty that perceives universals. When Coleridge and Marsh had said that Christianity is ""rational"", this is what they meant: that its doctrines are consistent with the universal laws of being as these are known by the faculty of reason. As Marsh put it: ""though we may believe what 'passeth all understanding' [that is, what we cannot perceive through the senses: the miraculous], we cannot believe what is absurd, or contradictory to reason.""

&gt; Coleridge learned his Kant through the mediation of later German philosophers, notably Friedrich Schelling, the man who had furnished Louis Agassiz's mind with the teachings of *Naturphilosophie* at the University of Berlin, and large chunks of whose prose Coleridge had a habit of incorporating into his own writings without the trouble of quotation marks. It was from Schelling that Coleridge took the key concept of his own thought, which is the organic unity, the ultimate indivisibility, of part and whole, matter and spirit, mind and nature. The transcendent and metaphysical unity --- transcendent because it is ""greater"" than the parts which compose it, metaphysical because it is ""beyond"" the world that we know through the senses --- is what ""reason"" perceives. ""Christianity"", Coleridge wrote, in a passage noted by Marsh, ""is not a theory, or a speculation, but a Life. Not a Philosophy of Life, but a Life and a living process."" This is the essence of the Romantic reaction, the great renunciation of mechanism in Post-Enlightenment European culture.",2,1581215997,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f129do/james_marshs_efforts_to_reconcile_science_reason/,philosophy,1

In short, it doesn't matter whether we came from apes or not, the fact is we are re-created every day and maintained by the Earth.

f0xuvh,TheGuillamon,The Meaning of God is Dead - Nietzsche,"&gt;*God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?* \-  Friedrich Nietzsche

The death of God didn’t strike Nietzsche as an entirely good thing. Without a God, the basic belief system of Western Europe was in jeopardy, as he put it in Twilight of the Idols: 

&gt;*When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident… Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole.*

Nietzsche thought this could be a good thing for some people, saying: “... at hearing the news that 'the old god is dead', we philosophers and 'free spirits' feel illuminated by a new dawn.” A bright morning had arrived. With the old system of meaning gone a new one could be created, but it came with risks—ones that could bring out the worst in human nature. Nietzsche believed that the removal of this system put most people at the risk of despair or **meaninglessness**. What could the point of life be without a God? Even if there was one, the Western world now knew that he hadn’t placed us at the centre of the universe, and it was learning of the lowly origin from which man had evolved. We finally saw the true world. The universe wasn’t made solely for human existence anymore. Nietzsche feared that this understanding of the world would lead to pessimism, **“a will to nothingness”** that was antithetical to the life-affirming philosophy Nietzsche prompted.

His fear of nihilism and our reaction to it was shown in The Will to Power, when he wrote that: 

&gt;""What I relate is the history of the next two centuries. I describe what is coming, what can no longer come differently: the advent of nihilism... For some time now our whole European culture has been moving as toward a catastrophe."" 

He would not have been surprised by the events that plagued Europe in the 20th century. Communism, Nazism, Nationalism, and the other ideologies that made their way across the continent in the wake of World War I sought to provide man with meaning and value, as a worker, as an Aryan, or some other greater deed; in a similar way as to how Christianity could provide meaning as a child of God, and give life on Earth value by relation to heaven. While he may have rejected those ideologies, he no doubt would have acknowledged the need for the meaning they provided.

Of course, as Nietzsche saw this coming, he offered us a way out. The creation of our own values as individuals. The creation of a meaning of life by those who live it. The archetype of the individual who can do this has a name that has also reached our popular consciousness: **the Übermensch.** Nietzsche however, saw this as a distant goal for man and one that most would not be able to reach. The Übermensch, which he felt had yet to exist on Earth, would create meaning in life by their will alone, and understand that they are, in the end, responsible for their selection. As he put it in Thus Spoke Zarathustra: 

&gt;For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred yes is needed: the spirit now wills his own will.

Such a bold individual will not be able to point to dogma or popular opinion as to why they value what they do.

Having suggested the rarity and difficulty in creating the Übermensch, Nietzsche suggested an alternative response to Nihilism, and one that he saw as the more likely to be selected; The Last Man. A “most contemptible thing” who lives a quiet life of comfort, without thought for individuality or personal growth as: ""'We have discovered happiness,' -- say the Last Men, and they blink."" Much to the disappointment of Zarathustra, Nietzsche’s mouthpiece, the people whom he preaches to beg him for the lifestyle of The Last Man, suggesting his pessimism on our ability to handle God’s death. 

But you might ask, if God has been dead for so long and we are supposed to be suffering for knowing it, where are all the atheists? Nietzsche himself provided an answer: 

&gt;God is dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown.

 Perhaps we are only now seeing the effects of Nietzsche’s declaration.

Indeed, atheism is on the march, with near majorities in many European countries and newfound growth across the United States heralding a cultural shift. But, unlike when atheism was enforced by the communist nations, there isn’t necessarily a worldview backing this new lack of God, it is only the lack. 

As many atheists know, to not have a god without an additional philosophical structure providing meaning can be a cause of existential dread. 

Are we at risk of becoming a society struggling with our own meaninglessness? Are we as a society at risk for nihilism? Are we more vulnerable now to ideologies and conmen who promise to do what God used to do for us and society? While Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the future, the non-religious are less so than the religious. It seems Nietzsche may have been wrong in the long run about our ability to deal with the idea that God is dead.

f0xbkm,average_person99,Have we approached the question of the origin of humanity in the wrong way?," 

The  debate about the origin of humanity is usually between whether we are  created by some higher being(s) or evolved from apes. However, isn't  there a more definite way to answer this? Like, the matter that composes  our body and cells comes from the Earth. Most of our cells need food,  water, air, and Earth's gravity to survive, renew, and multiply on a  continuous basis. Earth's magnetic field also protects us from being  cooked by space radiations. Therefore, isn't it adequate to say that we  owe our life and existence to the Earth on a continuous basis?

f0x87y,SuperMario43,Humanity's Creator,"Do you think about where you are in life? What is the meaning of your existence? 

I am a Roman Catholic &amp; think about God quite often. I am not going to convince you of my religion as I know there can be many conflicts that have happened because of this. But can we agree that we do not have consciousness because of some coincidence, it is to my belief that there is a higher power. And for me that is God, he created us on this earth &amp; have given us free will. To do as we please, but this does not come without consequences.

So with that being said, what is our purpose? I had a really interesting experience last night, I felt nauseous, sick to my stomach &amp; mentally drained, when I hopped into bed I began praying &amp; dwelling on this question “God” however you would like to word it. I prayed over and over repeating the “Our Father” &amp; “Hail Mary”. In doing so I felt my body become soothed, physically &amp; mentally. It was such a rich feeling I truly cannot describe it in any other way. I recommend that whoever you are and whatever you believe if you just give it a chance, simply do the sign of the cross &amp; pray if you know the words &amp; even if you don’t just open up your mind &amp; heart. 

Begin dwelling on the higher being who created us &amp; this earth. Think about what it means to be bigger than ourselves, what else is out there? How much has humanity learned from the beginning of time? I believe that we could have evolved from apes, but who did such a thing? How narrow minded/naive must we be to think that we are “special” with no purpose. Let your mind wonder, think about your past life experiences, any suffering you have been through, ask for forgiveness even if you are not 100% faithful in God, think about any kindness you have given, received, just REFLECT. 

I believe that we need to practice such reflection every night, even if it is not prayer, just dwell upon the possibility of a higher power, maybe you are not thankful for your life &amp; where you are right now, but try to remember any happiness, love, comfort and kindness in your life. I believe those who cannot do any of the above are the one’s who must do this the most. Let you pain &amp; suffering out inside of your head, it is to my belief that God knows and can feel all of our thoughts/emotions. So as painful as it might be think upon your past the good &amp; bad. Get lost in your thoughts, ask for forgiveness, for more love &amp; kindness in your days. Give back to those you encounter, show love, feel empathy. 

This world has so much bad, but also so much good. It is hard to think of these things when the media simply shows what is wrong &amp; puts a magnifying glass on the wrong &amp; evil. Let us change our mindsets through reflection &amp; being thankful. If there is one thing we can be certain of it is that our lives do not end here. Have you thought about life after death, it truly is fascinating. I believe heaven or hell is what we make it, if we surround/infect our thoughts with love/compassion/kindness/warmness then our imagination will become reality when we pass, on the other hand those that crowd their minds with judgement/negativity/hate/fear/hostility then when we pass that is what will become of your reality. 

My dream is to spread this mindset across the world. I would love nothing more than to have everyone try for at least one week, reflect upon their experiences of life up to their present. If this could be done, if everyone could have an open mind and reach out to whatever higher power they believe in, I truly believe that we can change this world for the better. If this movement can go beyond social platforms &amp; become a “trend” I would love for the WORLD to unify together &amp; try reflection, prayer and meditation together, simultaneously I believe it could bring upon a miracle unseen in any of our lifetimes. For whoever created us is watching, he knows of our sins, our blessings and our paths. It truly would be a beautiful sight. 

So please I ask you to just try it, join me on the journey of reflection, dwell on your love and your hatred, let it all out in the comfort of your bed before you go to sleep. Take an early night and let your mind wander upon these questions, think of a progressive future, let your imagination flow until you fall asleep. Think until your mind shuts off, reflect until you are sound asleep, and I promise it can and will change something in your life.",1,1581193828,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f0x87y/humanitys_creator/,philosophy,1

Now, clearly, that piece of paper existed, and it had a number written on it. There are many ways you could go about trying to guess what that number was, but only one answer is correct, and all others are incorrect.

There are many ways that people can attempt to reason their way towards the correct answer. Perhaps you can be intuitive, and guess 1 as it's the first number. Perhaps you can rely on statistics, and say since 7 is the most common number between 1 and 10 humans randomly guess, I might have written 777 777. Or you may take information about me (I'm a teenage male) to inform your guess of 69 420.

The point is, there is no way to get any closer to the answer. We know many things the number wasn't (a billion, minus one, and any irrational number), but we can't find out what the number WAS. Even once we accept an answer does exist, utilizing every aspect of human intuition, logic, and reason will ultimately brings us no closer to the truth.

I have even made arguments on Reddit detailing that god being ABSOLUTELY omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and benevolent is completely impossible. after much self reflection I have actually change my mind and have come to the conclusion that if god knows absolutely everything and is absolutely all powerful then he can change the laws of the universe such as the laws and rules of logic. this means god could be using a different form of logic than us or no logic but he still can be ABSOLUTELY omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and benevolent if a creator of the universe exists and was atleast ABSOLUTELY omnipotent in the ""beginning"".

f0mu4v,labradf0rd,What did Nietzsche meant on this quote regarding unrequited love?,"""indispensable...to the lover is his unrequited love, which he would at no price relinquish for a state of indifference""

Did he try to say a one-sided lover would rather maintain his unrequited love and everything that comes with it (disdain, rejection, mockery) instead of condescension, lies and indifference? I believe indifference is harsher than hatred and rejection. Hatred and rejection have passion, indifference lacks passion.

The full quote is this, and I am most probably taking out the specific line above out of context. I'm not analyzing the whole quote, only the sentence I quoted first.

“The drive to knowledge has become too strong for us to be able to want happiness without knowledge or of a strong, firmly rooted delusion; even to imagine such a state of things is painful to us! Restless discovering and divining has such an attraction for us, and has grown as indispensable to us as is to the lover his unrequited love, which he would at no price relinquish for a state of indifference – perhaps, indeed, we too are unrequited lovers.”",0,1581137617,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/f0mu4v/what_did_nietzsche_meant_on_this_quote_regarding/,philosophy,1

f0a7sp,cuchuillin,Please help debate ethics of the distribution of inheritable wealth in families:,"The majority of personal wealth in the world is traditionally administered by the older generation, often predominantly by a male patriarch.  Variable proportions of this wealth are earned by the living or inherited from prior generations; those prior generations can be assumed to have left money for the use of their offspring and/or in trust for the benefit of future generations.

The distribution of money during life by competent adults is their free choice; on death, some legal systems still give certain automatic rights of inheritance to surviving family members, others increasingly don’t.

I wonder, to what extent is the tradition of parents retaining control of family money until death suitable for the modern world?  How could we improve patterns of distribution of wealth within families, for the good of all, according to principles of fairness, justice, need, etc?

Here are some reasons I can think of for individuals to keep hold of personal/family money in old age:

1. Personal needs: e.g. living &amp; housing costs, social life &amp; luxuries.  The requirement to finance basic health and social care obviously differs between states.
2. Emergency funds for self or others in dire need.
3. Gifts to charities and other good causes.
4. Money designated to pass on to children, grandchildren or future offspring but retained by parents on the basis that the intended recipient(s) have not yet reached sufficient maturity to be trusted with it, or if it would impede their path to self-sufficiency.
5. Belief that parentally-determined ‘need’, as and when required, should have priority over equal division between siblings.

With increasing age and infirmity, the ability of parents to help family members may reduce.  If illness results in incapacity for decision making, some family wealth may become “trapped” in possession of elderly relatives who don’t need it for themselves and who, if competent, may have wished for it to be passed on to the next generation.  Is there any logical reason for death to be the optimum point in time for the passing on of inheritable wealth?

A parent’s duty to their children is greater than the duty of one sibling to another, creating a potential conflict if the needs of one child outweigh the needs of another.  Parents may wish to treat their children differently according to their perception of need; this must be balanced by the need to maintain family relations through fairness and equality.

What makes economic sense?

In a country with means-tested social security (such as the UK), is there any sense in parents trying to equalise the wealth of children by treating them unequally? Importantly, unequal treatment may cause siblings to resent each other and thus reduce the probability of them wanting to help each other in future.  Secondly, in a capitalist society, people only gain real wealth by saving, with compounding gains, and saving only becomes realistically possible once a certain threshold is passed.  The cruel facts of economics are that if the same amount of money is given to poor person and to a rich person, the rich person’s absolute monetary benefit in the long run will be many times greater than that of the poor person.

Whilst equal treatment might seemingly result in Sibling A becoming richer than they ‘needs’ to be, the benefits of being able to save and invest mean that they will ultimately be considerably better able to help Sibling B (whom they may be on better terms with due to the equal treatment) at times of need.  If, however, Sibling B is given preferential access to family money for basic ‘needs’ - in the UK, in addition to wasting family assets by not claiming social security - they will get no national insurance credits, increasing genuine need in future.  Similarly, if Sibling B receiving a lump sum of early inheritance makes them ineligible for means-tested social security payments, within a year or two the lump sum will be gone and neither he nor Sibling A will have anything to show for it.

If an overall goal is to build collective family wealth, for long-term maximum prosperity of offspring, might it actually be better to give as much money as possible to the richest members of the family?  For such an approach to work within an extended family it would require very strong family bonds and values, so that nobody’s humanity was neglected.  It would depend upon wealthy family members acting with great compassion and kindness towards kin.  However, although this might make best economic sense, it wouldn’t be fair unless it was the autonomous choice of everyone concerned.

f0738t,nated331,Subconscious programming: Manipulating friends and family for the better,"A lot of blue collar labor jobs as we call them have a serious mental health issue that isn’t addressed because of that super scary phrase “toxic masculinity.” I think I know where toxic masculinity stems from but that’s a topic for another time. Construction was the number one industry of suicide last year. A lot of shade and things that will lower a persons self confidence are said daily on jobs like these under the disguise of a joke in all male work environments. I say this from experience and I’m ashamed but self aware enough to admit I’m probably one of the worst at degrading co-workers and friends but as a “joke” so it’s okay right? No, as I get older I learn more and know less. I’m learning just how easily manipulated our minds can be by these quick comments that we don’t think much about. I call it SUBCONSCIOUS PROGRAMMING (probably nothing new I know I’m not special.) Some of my words and phrases are “trash bag” or “what’s up dick?” Nothing super rude, something interpreted as goofy. Truly in it’s intent harmless but not so much in it’s outcome. I’ve seen these subtle comments bring down the morale and confidence of my many brotherhoods I’ve been blessed to share. Unfortunately some of which I have ruined with my “jokes.” I tried something different though, I started trying to keep my same sense of humor with uplifting jokes and names for people. It’s weird, it’s an adaptation for me because politeness doesn’t have to be disguised as a joke. It feels good you don’t need to coat it with humor, but humor is all I’ve known it’s how myself and many others survived our unique and troubling pasts so it’s hard to learn a new way of life rather at age 23 or 53. Breaking bad habits is hard, but very achievable. I started complimenting my friends and co workers, truly making the effort to change myself for the better and I gotta say at first it felt “corny” and uncomfortable,  kind of faggy if you can excuse my language. It was weird but in a couple of weeks that uncomfortableness was covered with joy of seeing people happier and feeling better about themselves. The environment is better, my life is overall better, everyone’s mindset is better. It made me feel like I had this power to dictate not just not the mood of the room but even in these peoples personal lives. I saw improvement everywhere. The joy is even greater in my own life. I think it takes one individual with a strong enough presence to reset the unhealthy ways of life we’ve comes to accept as okay under the ideas of “tradition.” I did this without making these people aware of what I was doing that’s the crazy thing. I don’t want the feeling of having them know I do this because I feel people behave differently than normal when they feel they’re apart of an experiment. On top of that I feel that things like tradition or pride gets in the way of our growth if we aware our way of life is being changed. We fear change, even if it’s good. I’m guilty myself of choosing comfort over the unknown. We have to outsmart these problems by recognizing their origins. That guy insulting you isn’t doing so out of hatred in a lot of cases it’s just all he’s known. It’s that desire to belong to a group within a man. He will compromise who he is to feel safe within a group. So much that he allows his own mind to be manipulated into a hateful place. You win by not letting it break you, don’t let yourself go down that dark path. No matter how many times you’re insulted or kicked while you’re down keep on being polite and complimenting your fellow brothers. I think you can change a persons mindset without them even knowing you’re doing it. Which can be used for something righteous like helping them find peace and happiness.

eztm7l,Skobby17,Who is to blame?,"Hello Reddit, there is something I have been wondering for quite some time now, to ask this I will give a short introduction.

The question I am about to ask has to do with our brain, our dna and so to ask who or what we really are. 

My brain and my body are like this because of several factors which include my dna and environmental factors like the amount of food I eat or some things that happened to me during my life which may or may not have affected the development of my brain. 

I want to use a metaphor for this: Let's say we compare a car with our brain and body, and we compare ''us'' with the driver in that car. So for example the car is very fast which makes the driver able to win some races, when the car would not be so fast we as a driver would not win races much. This same goes for us being smart or not smart, which allows us to get a good degree or fail miserably in our school career because our brain is just not developed enough to understand things.

Now the thing I want to ask is, how much for our accomplishments can we account for to our brain (car) and to our own us (driver). Because a good driver is nothing without a good car.

So if talent is a real thing, it needs hard work to achieve something in life, but achieve something with our talent is is also about being able to work hard. Some people just can't work hard because they are lazy, and being lazy is also a trait caused by our dna (for some part). So if someone is really dumb and really lazy and they accomplish nothing in life, is that because of their brain (car) or because of their laziness (''bad'' driver). And if that is because of both, can we really blame them?

I think my question comes down to this: Do we really can say that ''we'' did something, or do we have to say that our brain enables us to do something because in our dna is written that we are smart and determined to work hard.",1,1581001660,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eztm7l/who_is_to_blame/,philosophy,1

eznu5l,Throwaway1231000,Moral Foundation,"I wanted to do a thought experiment. I'm creating a moral philosophy that will stand the test of time, span multiple species and is a universal, and I mean in a sense of the universe itself universal, ideology.

It's pretty simple. Live and let live. If something is alive, you cannot kill it with justifying a good reason to do so. As of now, we kill people, animals, plants out of necessity or convenience, but when the time comes that it is done without a good reason, it shouldn't be done.

This spans thousands of years in the future and multi species. When we can create affordable, replicable meat, the killing of animals should be outlawed. When we can create artificial wombs, abortion should be outlawed. When we can create replicable paper, paper accessories, fruits and so on, killing and eating them should be outlawed.

Everything has a right to life, murderes and so on. We only have a right to kill defensively for our own survival. What kind of philosophy does this mimic and what holes do you see in it.

ezmm65,TheSunIsCheese,An interesting observation.,"Just an outsider looking in but let's be real for a moment.

     Imagine this, its 2009, bright sunny day, you're walking down the road and you may have had a cell phone but some of us did not have one yet. You finally get to your school/college or work. You work the full shift, but you've had an alright day. You finally get a chance to check your phone. You have a voicemail perhaps, maybe a text or two. You reply accordingly and go on with your day. That my friends is how it used to be. 

    Imagine this, its present day, literally February 5th, 2020. You have your cell phone in your hand going down the same road to your college/school or work but something is different. You can sense it but you dont know what it is. Millions of us dont truly grasp the social climate going on with the world today but we have a chance to find out. 

    In today's world, we are connected by virtual synapses that's not only bind us to our reality but the one we inhabit in a different universe entirely (for lack of a better word). The universe I am talking about is one we all contribute to and collectively add to its accountability database. In a sense of true and false, this universe produces a true result by information it is given and it generates false reading only when enough factors that are irrefutable are compiled to drive the global narrative.

    We have all been a part of a chain of human lineage but we haven't always been connected. In today's age, it's as simple as a few clicks, some basic information, etc. This of course is social media. With just a few minutes and nothing better to do, one could essentially create a life that either has never existed before (personas) or they are real personalities (your true self image) but either way its filtered by a real brain. A brain that's been hardwired to have social interaction but maybe not on a global scale. Of course I would not be suggesting that social media is only evil but my point of the post is, the suggestion of asking ourselves why.

    Why in today's age must some of us post our whole life on social media, is it purely just attention or is it some kind of mental diagnosis we may be discovering in today's time ? Its possible at least in my mind to say, it could be something people would've done 400 years ago but at the same time you must ponder, would they do the same thing ? Also if in a stretch of 11 years we've came a long way but where will be in another 11 ?",1,1580962406,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ezmm65/an_interesting_observation/,philosophy,1

With that said, the colloquial usage of ""race"" e.g. ""black, asian, white"" and whatever other informal descriptors, is largely reflected upon certain phenotypes. 

For example being black makes you far far more likely to have sections of ATNC proteins linked to relatively high fast twitch muscle density in comparison to all other phenotypes and by extension in comparison to any class of humans - including non-scientific classifications of race, say ""white people"".

With that said, when it comes to different forms of intelligence it seems we all are very very similar, using most any definition of the word, and I wouldn't dare partake in what is commonly considered scientific racism, but to expect that certain phenotypes (irregardless of their relation to the unscientific usage of race) would not vary, on average, in ANY way, when it comes to the mental capacity to solve or work on certain types of problems, still strikes me as extremely unlikely and I'd argue unscientific.

The example with Tibetans alone, shows the variability when it comes to things like oxygen intake, and we know for a fact that certain levels not only can increase stanima, but things like blood doping, have been shown to information increase processing times and other mental activities.",1,1580894323,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ez6x5s/what_is_racism_superiority_in_any_area_seems/,philosophy,1

This is one of the first deep dive into philosophy that I do. I've read some Schopenhauer, with a totallly untrained mind,  History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell, which is more like a support reading, and some contemporary Brazilian thinkers.  That is, I'm not experienced in the ways of philosophy. 

I got this book and, although it indeed feel sometimes like an introductory text, I'd say that this book more introductory for those who are already introduced. I'm slowly walking through the chapters and gathering a lot of doubts. I'm translating this from Portuguese so the terms might not well match the english version but... give it a try, please.

\- There's the idea of ""fundamental philosophical operation"". In my understanding, he says that the fundamental operation of philosophy is the understanding that whatever we see in the world doesn't mean that is the actual world but rather the manifestation of our impressions of it. Once we get it, we may understand our internal and external world, thus, we kinda transcend ourselves in the way that we now are aware of the object/world and aware of the awareness of the object.

‪A new company is started.  Just a founder and an idea. You have no other information, but are in a situation where you need to value the company.  An investor has agreed - for whatever reason - to invest $50k and has asked you to suggest and justify what % of ownership she should take.

Because the experiment asks us to make these valuations with no extra information, we are forced to think about the fundamental value of a person and an idea.

We start with the dollar value, and as we develop arguments, a new perspective on the philosophical issues unfolds.

exxzeb,I_4M_Bl4z3D,We are the weirdest species out there,"A race that evolved from living in the land we were given doing the things we were supposed to do. To creating cities and literally a whole new universe with the internet. We wonder why so many of us are sad and mentally ill these days, then we fail to see the over stimulation we receive and how the lifestyles we live have zero correlation to the lifestyle we were created to live. You put a man that was made to run around literally all day and hunt, a human whose sharp senses are vital to their survival and constantly need to watch out for life or death threats be it from whatever. Then humans will get this man and shove him in a chair for 12 hours a day, overload his senses from calorie dense and manufactured food all the way to porn and the over populated cities we live in surrounded by millions of people and ads and shows. The senses we used for survival are now being over loaded with meaningless bullshit and then we wonder why people get depression, anxiety, adhd or just go batshit crazy and why it is only something that has popped up in the past 50-200 years.

Then religion came into play, a myriad of organised religions and institutions that push their agendas onto people and the only that is stopping majority of people from abandoning these religions is just being told the idea of ""faith"". Then came along psychedelics, which literally shook up the human belief on everything we are and will be. Now we know there are naturally occurring substances that (when used properly, not just at some party to trip with your mates) showed people foreign/spiritual entities (which in some cases people have seemed to witness the same entity whilst tripping despite not knowing of one another and taking substances at different times in different places). These entities have communicated and shown people how to help their own lives and what it's like on the ""other side"". Now deemed to be hallucinogenic it is very easy to dismiss these off as just chemical reactions in the brain, but we have to view all the possibilities in order to be unbiased. But when you think about it, why would there be so many naturally occurring psychedelics that, with evidence, have been used by groups and sects thousands of years before us, and yet we still have no proper idea on why they even exist, other than the fact for us and animals to consume and trip and go on this ""hallucination"" (many animals have been documented consuming these plants) which might I add, was also time where lots of un-explainable things have been built and done (most common example would be pyramids). So we have plant-drugs that have literally have taken other people to a place where they consistently met certain entities in different trips, seeing past away loved ones, and having such conversations that would indicate it is the conscious souls meeting each other somewhere and not just an imagination. Yet when these findings are reported, these organised religious groups claim it as the devil putting them on earth to use as temptation.

We as a human race are dumb, lost, confused, literally tearing itself apart, and even though a large part of us know this happening, there is nothing we can do about it. They say the world was supposed to end in 2012, I think it did. I just feel like it's ""ending"" a bit differently to what we thought. I think it's more of a deteriorating and suffering ending rather than an instant one. I mean shit, you tell me, everyone is talking about how good life was in the early 2010's and before that. To be honest , we deserve all this because we did it to ourselves. There is so much more ""touchy"" topics and points on my mind to say for this but it's too long for reddit, maybe I'll start a blog or write a book idk.

PS: only thing I ask is please just to think without a bias when reading or commenting, because that is the only we can talk about, look and consider all possibilities. Also if anything I have said is wrong or something you want to rebut, please feel free to do so, I'm no scientist, just a 19 year old who thinks too much, so I'm open to discussion or any gems of wisdom, just don't be stupid that's all.",1,1580688475,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/exxzeb/we_are_the_weirdest_species_out_there/,philosophy,1

exqq64,Geoffistopholes,Freedom in a political sense,"I have been kicking around this ethical requirement of freedom: acting in a way that increases the agency or autonomy of others in the greatest way possible.  Or, a free society requires that individuals behave in a manner that increases the agency of others.

Is this a thing individuals living in societies that pride themselves on ""freedom"" should seek to do?  Is this a good definition for how free a society is?  

In my thinking, if everyone behaved this way then ""freedom"" would reach the highest level possible.  Yes there would be restrictions, you couldn't do something that limited the agency of another, for instance telling lies.  But it also prevents others from doing the same to you, so it would go a long way to ensure that you have good information, making sure you are always acting with a higher level of agency.

Granted, nothing would make it certain that others would act in kind so imposed limits could only limit yourself causing a situation where you don't participate to the fullest extent in a free society.  I can also see an issue with not understanding what creates the highest level of autonomy and this being prone to error and causing too much confusion to be workable.  There is also the possibility that freedom and agency aren't mutually necessary. 

Overall though I think it is a good maxim to live by or at least aspire to.  Thoughts?",1,1580660287,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/exqq64/freedom_in_a_political_sense/,philosophy,1

exovpr,tribecous,"A Unique Presentation of Apperceptive Agnosia with Potential to Shed Light on Unique Neurological Features of Visual Processing, with a Tie-In to Free Will","I recently came across an admittedly anecdotal account of apperceptive agnosia (link at the bottom), and was completely floored by the subjective experience described. For those who may not know, visual agnosia is a deficit in perception arising from damage sustained in highly specific brain trauma or resulting from a primary neurological disease - it rarely if ever presents spontaneously. 

Though there are a few forms depending on which stage/component of visual processing is impaired or interrupted, I will focus on apperceptive agnosia, the form described by the author below. In this form, there is damage to a vital circuit along the visual pathway which normally works to contextualize sensory data by attaching meaning to the rudimentary shapes, colors, forms, and textures associated with the early, subconscious stages of perception. We are only able to see if this circuit is intact, allowing the brain to draw on semantic memory in developing a complex visuospatial representation of the external world. If data from the retina is never contextualized in this way, it is by definition devoid of higher-level meaning. Objects in general can no longer be identified, with the afflicted individual only able to resolve specific features of the greater whole (a handle, a brush tip, a screw). This is a stunning and bizarre cognitive deficit - though visual acuity remains wholly intact, real perception fails. Absent the ability to parse optical stimuli, no semantic representation of the visual field can form, leaving anyone afflicted functionally blind.

I was immediately struck by the unique presentation of apperceptive agnosia described below. The writer explains that her vision is dominated by either vivid visual snow/noise or a neutral grey field. This is unusual - nearly all individuals with the condition describe seeing abstract, unrecognizable blobs of color and texture, sometimes covered in minute details, sometimes feeling painfully familiar, but always just escaping identification ([see this representation of apperceptive agnosia](https://i.redd.it/80mcpfvbc1u21.jpg)). In the writer's case, it seems the visual-semantic break has occurred in a more basal region, compromising perception of even the most basic visual features. Translation of signal to meaning is catastrophically stunted.

Because this expose has been far too long, I'll skip over another fascinating feature of the writer's agnosia (the slow resolution of rich images with sustained absence of motion - an apparent indicator that her brain, outstandingly, has found an alternative means of constructing the visual world, albeit far less efficiently). 

Philosophical implications arise from the description of what I'll call 'blind-sight'. There are instances of blind-sight where the causative factor is deep-rooted delusion accompanied by no measurable dysfunction or injury in the brain, eye, or optic nerve - this phenomenon is not what I'm referring to. Instead, the blind-sight in the anecdote serves as clear support of the two-streams hypothesis of visual processing - the author's uncanny ability to track motion, maintain eye contact, adjust focus, and detect objects and obstacles despite a complete lack of conscious visual experience points to a functional dorsal stream. The ""where"" dorsal stream is relatively basic compared to the ""what"" ventral stream, and can be defined as the visual pathway responsible for endowing geographical qualities to sensory signals from the retina, in essence creating a map of the three-dimensional 'bubble' surrounding each of us. This gives a sense of presence, ego-centrism, continuity, movement, and spatial awareness.

Importantly, neither the machinations nor the output of the dorsal stream are made consciously available. So, while a lesion here could lead to profound deficits, like complete ignorance of the left visual field, the afflicted individual usually will not notice any disruption to their vision. Conversely, a lesion to the ventral stream can produce effects like those described below - a mysterious intuition about one's environment without any rich, meaningful visual experience.

This case offers a potential challenge to free will. We are perpetually locked into a sense of direct and causal control, especially with regard to motion. Thus, we feel that conscious choices drive the movements of our eyes. We elect which faces to lock-on to, where and how to maneuver our bodies, and, more generally, we designate the primary object of visual focus and attention. However, what if our conscious visual experience were to suddenly vanish? How could we expect to retain our ability to hold eye contact, as the author has? Surely, if we were the ones consciously directing the precise dance of our pupils, relying on instant, active feedback to plan each subsequent saccadde, apperceptive agnosia would be completely incapacitating. We relied on vision to engage with and understand our environment, to help us plan basic things - where to look next, how to avoid stepping in the way of a car,  or how to connect visually with a conversational partner. 

If we need conscious visual experience to do these things, the writer could never develop 'blind-sight'. Where would the intuition to follow a face come from? And without conscious feedback, how could we possibly get the position correct and make any necessary adjustments? I believe this case is a clear example of how subconscious, deterministic processes are the impetus for our actions. They *are* our thoughts. The precise mechanisms lie outside of our purview as conscious agents, but in extreme and unusual situations, we find evidence for deeper, subconscious machinations that are the real directors of our lives, and the final arbiters in any decision big or small.

Because this expose has been far too long, I'll skip over another fascinating feature of the writer's agnosia (the slow resolution of rich images with sustained absence of motion - an apparent indicator that her brain, outstandingly, has found an alternative means of constructing the visual world, albeit far less efficiently). 

Philosophical implications arise from the description of what I'll call 'blind-sight'. There are instances of blind-sight where the causative factor is deep-rooted delusion accompanied by no measurable dysfunction or injury in the brain, eye, or optic nerve - this phenomenon is not what I'm referring to. Instead, the blind-sight in the anecdote serves as clear support of the two-streams hypothesis of visual processing - the author's uncanny ability to track motion, maintain eye contact, adjust focus, and detect objects and obstacles despite a complete lack of conscious visual experience points to a functional dorsal stream. The ""where"" dorsal stream is relatively basic compared to the ""what"" ventral stream, and can be defined as the visual pathway responsible for endowing geographical qualities to sensory signals from the retina, in essence creating a map of the three-dimensional 'bubble' surrounding each of us. This gives a sense of presence, ego-centrism, continuity, movement, and spatial awareness.

Importantly, neither the machinations nor the output of the dorsal stream are made consciously available. So, while a lesion here could lead to profound deficits, like complete ignorance of the left visual field, the afflicted individual usually will not notice any disruption to their vision. Conversely, a lesion to the ventral stream can produce effects like those described below - a mysterious intuition about one's environment without any rich, meaningful visual experience.

This case offers a potential challenge to free will. We are perpetually locked into a sense of direct and causal control, especially with regard to motion. Thus, we feel that conscious choices drive the movements of our eyes. We elect which faces to lock-on to, where and how to maneuver our bodies, and, more generally, we designate the primary object of visual focus and attention. However, what if our conscious visual experience were to suddenly vanish? How could we expect to retain our ability to hold eye contact, as the author has? Surely, if we were the ones consciously directing the precise dance of our pupils, relying on instant, active feedback to plan each subsequent saccadde, apperceptive agnosia would be completely incapacitating. We relied on vision to engage with and understand our environment, to help us plan basic things - where to look next, how to avoid stepping in the way of a car,  or how to connect visually with a conversational partner. 

If we need conscious visual experience to do these things, the writer could never develop 'blind-sight'. Where would the intuition to follow a face come from? And without conscious feedback, how could we possibly get the position correct and make any necessary adjustments? I believe this case is a clear example of how subconscious, deterministic processes are the impetus for our actions. They *are* our thoughts. The precise mechanisms lie outside of our purview as conscious agents, but in extreme and unusual situations, we find evidence for deeper, subconscious machinations that are the real directors of our lives, and the final arbiters in any decision big or small.

exov9y,tribecous,"A Unique Presentation of Apperceptive Agnosia with Potential to Shed Light on Unique Neurological Features of Visual Processing, with a Tie-In to Free Will","I recently came across an admittedly anecdotal account of apperceptive agnosia (link at the bottom), and was completely floored by the subjective experience described. For those who may not know, visual agnosia is a deficit in perception arising from damage sustained in highly specific brain trauma or resulting from a primary neurological disease - it rarely if ever presents spontaneously. 

Though there are a few forms depending on which stage/component of visual processing is impaired or interrupted, I will focus on apperceptive agnosia, the form described by the author below. In this form, there is damage to a vital circuit along the visual pathway which normally works to contextualize sensory data by attaching meaning to the rudimentary shapes, colors, forms, and textures associated with the early, subconscious stages of perception. We are only able to see if this circuit is intact, allowing the brain to draw on semantic memory in developing a complex visuospatial representation of the external world. If data from the retina is never contextualized in this way, it is by definition devoid of higher-level meaning. Objects in general can no longer be identified, with the afflicted individual only able to resolve specific features of the greater whole (a handle, a brush tip, a screw). This is a stunning and bizarre cognitive deficit - though visual acuity remains wholly intact, real perception fails. Absent the ability to parse optical stimuli, no semantic representation of the visual field can form, leaving anyone afflicted functionally blind.

I was immediately struck by the unique presentation of apperceptive agnosia described below. The writer explains that her vision is dominated by either vivid visual snow/noise or a neutral grey field. This is unusual - nearly all individuals with the condition describe seeing abstract, unrecognizable blobs of color and texture, sometimes covered in minute details, sometimes feeling painfully familiar, but always just escaping identification ([see this representation of apperceptive agnosia](https://i.redd.it/80mcpfvbc1u21.jpg)).

Instead, the blind-sight in the anecdote serves as clear support of the two-streams hypothesis of visual processing - the author's uncanny ability to track motion, maintain eye contact, adjust focus, and detect objects and obstacles despite a complete lack of conscious visual experience points to a functional dorsal stream. The ""where"" dorsal stream is relatively basic compared to the ""what"" ventral stream, and can be defined as the visual pathway responsible for endowing geographical qualities to sensory signals from the retina, in essence creating a map of the three-dimensional 'bubble' surrounding each of us. This gives a sense of presence, ego-centrism, continuity, movement, and spatial awareness.

Importantly, neither the machinations nor the output of the dorsal stream are made consciously available. So, while a lesion here could lead to profound deficits, like complete ignorance of the left visual field, the afflicted individual usually will not notice any disruption to their vision. Conversely, a lesion to the ventral stream can produce effects like those described below - a mysterious intuition about one's environment without any rich, meaningful visual experience.

This case offers a potential challenge to free will. We are perpetually locked into a sense of direct and causal control, especially with regard to motion. Thus, we feel that conscious choices drive the movements of our eyes. We elect which faces to lock-on to, where and how to maneuver our bodies, and, more generally, we designate the primary object of visual focus and attention. However, what if our conscious visual experience were to suddenly vanish? How could we expect to retain our ability to hold eye contact, as the author has? Surely, if we were the ones consciously directing the precise dance of our pupils, relying on instant, active feedback to plan each subsequent saccadde, apperceptive agnosia would be completely incapacitating. We relied on vision to engage with and understand our environment, to help us plan basic things - where to look next, how to avoid stepping in the way of a car,  or how to connect visually with a conversational partner. 

If we need conscious visual experience to do these things, the writer could never develop 'blind-sight'. Where would the intuition to follow a face come from? And without conscious feedback, how could we possibly get the position correct and make any necessary adjustments? I believe this case is a clear example of how subconscious, deterministic processes are the impetus for our actions. They *are* our thoughts. The precise mechanisms lie outside of our purview as conscious agents, but in extreme and unusual situations, we find evidence for deeper, subconscious machinations that are the real directors of our lives, and the final arbiters in any decision big or small.

exov8f,tribecous,"A Unique Presentation of Apperceptive Agnosia with Potential to Shed Light on Unique Neurological Features of Visual Processing, with a Tie-In to Free Will","I recently came across an admittedly anecdotal account of apperceptive agnosia (link at the bottom), and was completely floored by the subjective experience described. For those who may not know, visual agnosia is a deficit in perception arising from damage sustained in highly specific brain trauma or resulting from a primary neurological disease - it rarely if ever presents spontaneously. 

Though there are a few forms depending on which stage/component of visual processing is impaired or interrupted, I will focus on apperceptive agnosia, the form described by the author below. In this form, there is damage to a vital circuit along the visual pathway which normally works to contextualize sensory data by attaching meaning to the rudimentary shapes, colors, forms, and textures associated with the early, subconscious stages of perception. We are only able to see if this circuit is intact, allowing the brain to draw on semantic memory in developing a complex visuospatial representation of the external world. If data from the retina is never contextualized in this way, it is by definition devoid of higher-level meaning. Objects in general can no longer be identified, with the afflicted individual only able to resolve specific features of the greater whole (a handle, a brush tip, a screw). This is a stunning and bizarre cognitive deficit - though visual acuity remains wholly intact, real perception fails. Absent the ability to parse optical stimuli, no semantic representation of the visual field can form, leaving anyone afflicted functionally blind.

I was immediately struck by the unique presentation of apperceptive agnosia described below. The writer explains that her vision is dominated by either vivid visual snow/noise or a neutral grey field. This is unusual - nearly all individuals with the condition describe seeing abstract, unrecognizable blobs of color and texture, sometimes covered in minute details, sometimes feeling painfully familiar, but always just escaping identification ([see this representation of apperceptive agnosia](https://i.redd.it/80mcpfvbc1u21.jpg)). In the writer's case, it seems the visual-semantic break has occurred in a more basal region, compromising perception of even the most basic visual features. Translation of signal to meaning is catastrophically stunted.

Because this expose has been far too long, I'll skip over another fascinating feature of the writer's agnosia (the slow resolution of rich images with sustained absence of motion - an apparent indicator that her brain, outstandingly, has found an alternative means of constructing the visual world, albeit far less efficiently).

This gives a sense of presence, ego-centrism, continuity, movement, and spatial awareness.

Importantly, neither the machinations nor the output of the dorsal stream are made consciously available. So, while a lesion here could lead to profound deficits, like complete ignorance of the left visual field, the afflicted individual usually will not notice any disruption to their vision. Conversely, a lesion to the ventral stream can produce effects like those described below - a mysterious intuition about one's environment without any rich, meaningful visual experience.

This case offers a potential challenge to free will. We are perpetually locked into a sense of direct and causal control, especially with regard to motion. Thus, we feel that conscious choices drive the movements of our eyes. We elect which faces to lock-on to, where and how to maneuver our bodies, and, more generally, we designate the primary object of visual focus and attention. However, what if our conscious visual experience were to suddenly vanish? How could we expect to retain our ability to hold eye contact, as the author has? Surely, if we were the ones consciously directing the precise dance of our pupils, relying on instant, active feedback to plan each subsequent saccadde, apperceptive agnosia would be completely incapacitating. We relied on vision to engage with and understand our environment, to help us plan basic things - where to look next, how to avoid stepping in the way of a car,  or how to connect visually with a conversational partner. 

If we need conscious visual experience to do these things, the writer could never develop 'blind-sight'. Where would the intuition to follow a face come from? And without conscious feedback, how could we possibly get the position correct and make any necessary adjustments? I believe this case is a clear example of how subconscious, deterministic processes are the impetus for our actions. They *are* our thoughts. The precise mechanisms lie outside of our purview as conscious agents, but in extreme and unusual situations, we find evidence for deeper, subconscious machinations that are the real directors of our lives, and the final arbiters in any decision big or small.

exov71,tribecous,"A Unique Presentation of Apperceptive Agnosia with Potential to Shed Light on Unique Neurological Features of Visual Processing, with a Tie-In to Free Will","I recently came across an admittedly anecdotal account of apperceptive agnosia (link at the bottom), and was completely floored by the subjective experience described. For those who may not know, visual agnosia is a deficit in perception arising from damage sustained in highly specific brain trauma or resulting from a primary neurological disease - it rarely if ever presents spontaneously. 

Though there are a few forms depending on which stage/component of visual processing is impaired or interrupted, I will focus on apperceptive agnosia, the form described by the author below. In this form, there is damage to a vital circuit along the visual pathway which normally works to contextualize sensory data by attaching meaning to the rudimentary shapes, colors, forms, and textures associated with the early, subconscious stages of perception. We are only able to see if this circuit is intact, allowing the brain to draw on semantic memory in developing a complex visuospatial representation of the external world. If data from the retina is never contextualized in this way, it is by definition devoid of higher-level meaning. Objects in general can no longer be identified, with the afflicted individual only able to resolve specific features of the greater whole (a handle, a brush tip, a screw). This is a stunning and bizarre cognitive deficit - though visual acuity remains wholly intact, real perception fails. Absent the ability to parse optical stimuli, no semantic representation of the visual field can form, leaving anyone afflicted functionally blind.

I was immediately struck by the unique presentation of apperceptive agnosia described below. The writer explains that her vision is dominated by either vivid visual snow/noise or a neutral grey field. This is unusual - nearly all individuals with the condition describe seeing abstract, unrecognizable blobs of color and texture, sometimes covered in minute details, sometimes feeling painfully familiar, but always just escaping identification ([see this representation of apperceptive agnosia](https://i.redd.it/80mcpfvbc1u21.jpg)). In the writer's case, it seems the visual-semantic break has occurred in a more basal region, compromising perception of even the most basic visual features. Translation of signal to meaning is catastrophically stunted.

Because this expose has been far too long, I'll skip over another fascinating feature of the writer's agnosia (the slow resolution of rich images with sustained absence of motion - an apparent indicator that her brain, outstandingly, has found an alternative means of constructing the visual world, albeit far less efficiently). 

Philosophical implications arise from the description of what I'll call 'blind-sight'. There are instances of blind-sight where the causative factor is deep-rooted delusion accompanied by no measurable dysfunction or injury in the brain, eye, or optic nerve - this phenomenon is not what I'm referring to.

exmc4n,eu4fanboi,Is Nietzche's Eternal Recurrence applicable in a broader and wider way?,"In Nietzche's theory, time is infinite (and if it isn't, when the universe comes to an end, then it can be restarted infinite times through the Big Bang). Because time is infinite, everything that can happen will happen. Nietzche uses this to say that you have and will live this life an endless number of times. 

My expansion to the theory and hypothesis is this: since everything that can happen will happen, there is a life you live where you are X, where X is a certain variable that is anything except another creature/person altogether. Let me elaborate. If I took you out of this body and put you in mine and vice-versa, given that we keep everything else, I am still 'me' even though I am in another body. If I became a scientist and a historian at two different times in this life (or these are two end results of two different paths in life) both historian me and scientist me is 'me', is he not? Hence it is possible that since all things that can happen (everything in the universe in existence at any time) will happen you will and can exist in different forms. I also argue that rather than one coherent person you are actually different people on a continuum, ie when you eat you are not sleeping so those two people doing different things are different people even though they are otherwise the same, so you could be someone else at a point on another person's continuum as it were.",1,1580637602,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/exmc4n/is_nietzches_eternal_recurrence_applicable_in_a/,philosophy,1

exhv4j,TheODIES,My Philosophy #1 (Is this the right place for this?),"I am going to start doing philosophical posts on life from my experiences here. If it becomes popular I will do them more often and even make my own page! Anyways here we go:

People in our generation should be more outgoing and social. Compliment everyone on everything, regardless of age, gender, race, looks, financial status, or beliefs compliments do not have to be flirting they are just nice and friendly. But if someone does compliment you and you find them attractive, then date them! I am so tired of people thinking that dating is basically marriage, NO! Dating is like test driving a car, when you are shopping for a car you don't just test drive one and be like this is the one I am not even going to try another one, NO! When shopping for the right car you test drive or at least consider test driving it and look at it if it even remotely peaks your interest. So, do that with dating! If it does not work out friend zone them and move on, but do not just friend zone them right off the bat.

Life is too short to be so serious about life people! Be more open to all people, do not judge a book entirely based on it's cover. I know a ton of people will say that it is hard when other people do they because those people are not willing to engage in social interactions, unless they meet their standards of looks, financial status, and social status. But ignore those people! They are useless members of society that we as a society need to stop championing like they mean something. I am looking at you Hollywood, designer clothes industry, and models (male and female). These people cause us to be materialistic, we have this conception that people who do not own Apple AirPods are somehow lesser financially than those who do own them. The reality is that AirPods are one the biggest scams to ever see light on Earth! They are just like their wired cousins same performance, now you gotta charge them now and pay $170.00 more now.

So, people please for the health of our generation go out into the world and be open to more people smile at the super model as you pass them walking down the street today (as usual), shake hands the guy searching for a blue collar job as he has just got out of prison and wish him luck in his future, remind him things will get better, say good morning to the Wall street Broker as you pass by them, and stop by the homeless guy on the corner wish them for better days and get them something if they need it. All of these things are so easy now please help us all by doing these simple things. Have an amazing day, much love. -TheODIES

TL;DR : Be nice, date as you please, don't judge people, welcome everyone no matter who they are into your life. Love you all.",1,1580612846,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/exhv4j/my_philosophy_1_is_this_the_right_place_for_this/,philosophy,1

When I make a decision I make it in accordance with what I consider moral in terms of what I have learned in life and how I reason.

It seems like they simply don't put thought into their decisions, like they choose based on what feels good at the time.  How do you deal with people who simply do whatever they want when they feel like it?

ex4yzh,ssamt,My idea about Utilitarianism,"Although I'm making a post here, I actually know almost nothing about philosophy, so please tell me if I misunderstood something.

I had this idea after learning about Rawls. The main reason that I didn't accept Utilitarianism was because I thought it wasn't properly defined. Utilitarianism tells me to maximize the sum of all happiness, but happiness is not a number, and it seemed as if there was no way to add it.

And for exactly the same reason, I did not agree to Rawls. The concept of difference principle wasn't properly defined. Let's say there are two societies with two people each that one can choose from, without knowing which person they will be.

A: 2 people both get happiness of 1

B: 1 person gets happiness of 0, 1 person gets 2

Unlike what Utilitarianism suggests, Rawls will say that people will choose to live in A, to avoid the worst situation possible. But here's the problem: what is happiness of 2? Happiness of 0 is obviously doing nothing(or maybe ""not existing"") and happiness of 1 can be defined as anything in the same way 100 degrees Celsius is defined, but it is harder to define happiness of 2. Logically, 2 should be 1+1, but Rawls did not propose a way of actually adding these(as far as I know).

But although it's impossible to add them directly, you can compare them. You can say whether you prefer A or B much easier than trying to add them. And here's my main idea. Let's assume a similar situation, but replace happiness of 2 with ""Action X"".

A: 2 people both get happiness of 1

B: 1 person gets happiness of 0, 1 person does action X

Now if Action X is something really good, people will choose B, and if it's really bad, they'll choose A. The point is that for any person, there exists a point where the person would say that A and B have equal values. It'll probably be different for everyone, but it exists. Action X is now *defined* as happiness of 2, because it's a natural way of calculating 1+1. This can easily be extended to every integer(negative numbers are unhappiness), therefore allowing us to calculate happiness.

ex2p0j,MattPilkerson,"What is your opinion on the potential for ""evil"" in human beings in regards to their upbringing and genetics?","&amp;#x200B;

*TDLR at bottom*.

So, I grew up with a loving mom (who had a tough childhood), and a dad who worked abroad in the military and later lived quite far away. Saw him once or twice a year. He also had a very difficult childhood. Dad always paid to take care of us, and called once in a while. But didn't know how to parent in the sense of molding your children and keeping them on task. But truly a good person.

In grade school I was picked on a lot. Always picked last. Nothing was wrong with my physically, and nothing overtly social was wrong on the surface from what I could tell. I remember being made fun of even by a handicapped kid. And often no one sitting next to me during lunch. Just for reference during lunch once someone said ""Who doesn't like (me)"" and a bunch of people raised their hand.

I was starved for acceptance by cool kids. I changed schools and went to a high school where I wasn't known. I met someone who smoked pot and then started doing that. I met someone who did that and of course got ripped off etc. The first time I had some cool kids call me I thought they were probably just trying to steal from me. Long story short they weren't, I was somewhat accepted. I skipped class to smoke pot, etc. I got into fights (totally apart from my personality and I hated it) to be accepted. I would throw people under the bus and do anything for positive attention.

The thing that made me feel most accepted was sex. If an attractive girl slept with me it was the best, not because I wanted to have sex as much as it was that I was accepted.

I put my mom through hell. Having to find me at night, etc. Me not going to college until later, etc. The guilt wears on me everyday. She worked so much she didn't have time to discipline us right.

So into my teens, I would drink and drive, I would punched a few people who didn't deserve it, I stole things, I would manipulate and lie.

But the reason my mom worked so much was to make sure we didn't grow up in the ghetto. We lived in a nicer area but rented while everyone else was pretty well off.

I have always been a pussy at heart and have a healthy propensity for feeling others pain, but the need/want for acceptance overrode that.

This made me think, if I was raised in a bad area where there were many gangs and instead of fights etc would I have been capable of serious crimes against people if put in those situations? The only reason I wasn't put in positions of shooting someone etc is because I wasn't raised in those situations. But if given those ultimatums what would I have done? I think I would never do that, based on how I feel, but could/would my need/want for acceptance override until that. And if so, would that make me an ""evil"" person?

ewq271,Socrababble,Back to Mordor,"Approximately 500 B.C. Socrates became the first moral philosopher. He predicted a universal philosophy that would give guidance to free will and consciousness. In this pursuit he became the Father of modern thought. 

The Socratic method is known as a negative or reductive philosophy in that it breaks down and tests ideas. This universal philosophy challenges Socratic Irony and paradoxes.

Socrates: “I neither know nor think that I know”

 “The unexamined life is not worth living”

“Ethical virtue is the only thing that matters”

“A system of morality which is based on relative emotional values is a mere illusion, a thoroughly vulgar conception which has nothing sound in it and nothing true.”

“I know nothing, except a certain small subject - Love, although on this subject, I’m thought amazing, better than anyone else, past or present.”

Paradoxes: “No one desires evil”

“No one errs or does wrong willingly or knowingly” 

“All virtue is knowledge”

“Virtue is significant for happiness”

This philosophy posits that existential thought presupposes one’s existence. If one knows therefore that they exist they can and do act on that Faith. I additionally posit that the following philosophy is and has been in active use by the whole of humanity since the dawn of consciousness.

You are already doing this. It begins with existence (faith) and moves left or right. An example of right is a child raised in a loving family. Left is more independent. Both require another person to complete and continue.

ew6pit,CrossXFir3,What is the solution to individual isolationism in an increasingly globalized world?,"I've asked this question to dozens of people over the past year and have yet to get a satisfactory answer. 

Other than religion, what do you think could be used to mitigate the kind of individual isolationism that causes a breakdown of small communities? 

I imagine the rise of school shootings and similar atrocities can be attributed in part to the power of globalization and the internet giving people an out from their own community. On the one hand, the modern era gives an individual an opportunity to reach out to others that are similar to them and create bonds with people you'd never have a chance to do so otherwise. But that (social media as a whole) also creates such a circle jerk of ideas that you fanaticize people. Of course the reverse can be said about rising someone in a church.

ew0q15,cbjurassic,Unimportant things to say,"So check this out. I think all things are unimportant things to say. With the lack of having an actual fuck of an idea about what information is actually valid anymore, there seems to be no structure of what’s truly beneficial. I can’t see a valid thing to say that should be of interest to anyone. Undoubtedly, everyone is allowed interests that seem meaningful to their lives, but I see no use in a single person on here saying anything if we are not unified on some base premise or ideal. Would an ultimate work here be for individual empowerment? Is it for the self-empowerment of narrow-minded, unstudied beliefs, forwarded by simple minds that may turn the cogs of society backwards? Psychology might suggest that this post simply means that I feel, I, personally, consider it worthless and pointless that I speak at all, or be heard, and maybe I have nothing meaningful to contribute, yet, can we not all honestly say that all we see are sheep leading sheep to the depths of sheepoleness? Is “love” our unified value? Is it “individually”? Please feel free to go back to whatever “worthwhile” thing you were doing and disregard the cynic who can’t find a place to bark loud enough 👋, but honestly, what main, unitive objective are we working towards as mass individuality grows in the world, other than an obviously unattainable enrichment proposed of acting humble and saying “be softer”? There seems no basis for good, if the ultimate win is simply in pacifism.

evk5qy,69NhilsticGod420,A New Philosophical Razor.,"I've been thinking about this for a while, and I've come to the conclusion that we might have a new philosophical razor. The concept of this razor is old, very old. BUT I haven't seen anyone use it in these words or make us of it in theist vs atheist discussions.  Aron Ra does when he talks about possibilities, but no one takes it up as serious, probably because it is not in a statement format 

The razor: 

That which hasn't been established can never be used to explain the established. 

This is fairly straight forward. One may never use somthing that is not know to be possible, to explain a possible thing. 

For example, imagine I come home one day and see all my shoes are missing. I see a massive green hat on the floor and a card that says ""Lepricons were here"" on the floor. Is it now to be to concluded that lepricons are to blame for my missing shoes? The evidence even implies it, or it can be assumed becasue of the evidence, can it not? 

Well No, and this razor gives the reason. 
All though the card might say lepricons, lepricons has not been established as something that can exist, crazy people who happen to be burglars do exist. 
So because lepricons are not established, we can dismisse them until there is a way to absolutley verify they are a possibility. 

I'll call this Sherlock's Razor.

(Notice this  Razor doesn't claim that lepricons are impossible, that would be a truth claim, it says that the idea of lepricons can be dismissed until it is established).",1,1580286150,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/evk5qy/a_new_philosophical_razor/,philosophy,1

ev33qj,OnlineExpat,Thoughts on the Zhuangzi. Would love some other thoughts and interpretations,"The Zhuangzi is a Daoist text about how a Daoist lives life. I guess it's about putting the Tao Te Ching into action. It's not religious by any means; it's purely philosophical. Below are some of the takeaways I took from the book. I wrote a lot of ""Zhuangzi is/says/thinks..."" but these are merely my interpretations and I don't really claim to know the man's thoughts. These thoughts are purely about the inner chapters. 

\- Zhuangzi (the author of the eponymous book) was a top tier critical thinker. His incredible aptitude for critical thought is on full display in the book.

\- Daoism is more about freedom and being true to oneself than anything else. It's not about inner peace, it's not about love, it's not about going to heaven, it's not about enlightenment, it's not about being a good person. Instead, it's about marching to the beat of your own drum and riding along that beat through life. If you can do this, then life will be as good and easy as it can be.

\- Daoism is incredibly flexible, open minded, and tolerant. It embraces, through critical thinking, the conclusion that there is no way to truly know anything. Therefore, Zhuangzi doesn't claim to have any of the answers to life. He doesn't claim ""You must do X, Y, and Z and never do A, B, or C if you want to be a good person/become enlightened/go to heaven etc."" He also claims that people don't need to strive to be good. He thinks people need to march to the beat of their own drum without regard to whether that beat makes you a good or bad person. 

\- Zhuangzi is a moral relativist to the max. He says not to dwell on how things should or should not be or what's right or wrong. Things are the way they are and it is merely an individual's opinion on what's right or wrong. If 2 people can disagree about what's ""right"", then it's not inherently right. His critical thinking here shines because he says it's important to be aware that everything you ""know"" is merely your own perspective. This expands far beyond just morality; it extends to everything we ""know"" in life. To be clear, it's okay (and I think inevitable) to have your own morals, but just remember they are *your own* morals and the universe doesn't consult your moral code on how it should be. 

\- Zhuangzi thinks flexibility of thought is essential for freedom of thought. Some people highly value sticking to their values and morals, but Zhuangzi thinks that's very limiting. Instead, he thinks it's okay if people have their own perspectives on life, but they should be able to concurrently and temporarily adopt other perspectives when the circumstances demand it. Some would view this as being hypocritical or 2-faced, but Zhuangzi's view is that our own views are merely perspectives (after all, we can't ""know"" or state anything as inherently true), so it is limiting and foolish to rigidly live our lives by them. 

What do you guys think of my interpretations of the Zhuangzi? I've always found philosophy books difficult to understand, but this book clicked with me. The Zhuangzi is identical to the philosophy I've developed for myself in life, so I don't fully trust my interpretations and takeaways. Maybe I'm just looking for things I agree with or reading it in such a way that it becomes agreeable. There is a lot more to the book, but I think I hit on the core takeaways.",0,1580201861,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ev33qj/thoughts_on_the_zhuangzi_would_love_some_other/,philosophy,1

euyk7o,CriticalSkepticism,"Is the Death of God Kant's Thing-in-Itself? Kant, Christianity and Quantum Mechanics","I think of our universe as a failed universe. It's permanently broken, and I would say that the Death of Christ as God is the fiction that properly illustrates this break. Our universe is the decay of its own failure to properly come into existence. The way I use the word failed is not so much out of pessimism, but in order to illustrate the fact that Being is not-whole. Being isn't a well-oiled fully determined machine. In quantum mechanics there's this notion called complementarity. In order to measure a phenomenon, a specific apparatus is needed. For example, in Classical Mechanics position and momentum are needed in order to predict the trajectory of a particle, but two mutually exclusive measuring devices are needed in order to measure position and momentum. This is where Heisenberg's uncertainty principle comes from. When we know momentum, we cannot know the position and when we know position we cannot know the momentum. Heisenberg's interpretation of this was that this was due to our own uncertainty, but Niels Bohr's interpretation is that it's not just that the other is not known, but the other is not even in itself determinate while its complimentary value is. For Bohr, the measuring apparatus embodies certain concepts to the exclusion of others, and concepts like position/momentum etc. only exist within particular experimental arrangements. In the end, modern experimental evidence actually points to Bohr's interpretation rather than Heisenberg's, and Heisenberg himself conceded to what modern quantum physicist Karan Barad calls Bohr's ""indeterminacy principle"". Before something is measured it is in a superposition; rather than being a determinate entity, the possible measurement is in a superposition of all possibilities of what it could be when measured. The Schrodinger's Cat paradox is all about this indeterminacy. Schrodinger proposed an experiment where a cat was put in a box along with a radioactive particle. If the particle decayed it would set of a Geiger counter which would loose a hammer to smash the cat. If it didn't decay, the cat would be ok. The particle is such that it has a 50-50 chance of decaying and killing the cat. Thus, before measurement, whether or not the cat is alive or dead is in a superposition. The situation is not yet determinate. Schrodinger says that ""it is only upon the measurement by a cognizing agent like consciousness that the superposition is collapsed into a mixture of determinate entities.""  Thus, Schrodinger takes Bohr's principle to the end. It is only within the apparatus of consciousness that determinate entities/ any concepts at all are even embodied. This could be compared to the Kantian notion of the thing-in-itself. For Kant, the thing-in-itself was unrepresentable because as soon as it was represented in consciousness it would be out of itself. As his successor Karl Leonard Reinhold would put it, the thing-in-itself must be a subject without any predicates. Thus, the thing-in-itself lacks any determinacy. It is purely indeterminate. The thing-in-itself is the lack of the thing. In itself, the thing is nothing. It is only through the marks of the thing/ it is only through the thing's appearance that it gains predicates/ resolves the indeterminacy. Thus, it would be improper to say that consciousness is something that happens in the world because it is only insofar as the world happens in consciousness that it can be spoken of at all. It is only through the apparatus of consciousness that the predicates like presence, existence, Being, or any predicates at all exist in the first place. This is what I mean by failure. Not so much that the universe is bad, but that the universe is only ever partially determinate, and nothing is ever determinate in-itself. In this way the ""failure"" of the universe to fully be in existence is not simply the source of woe, but also of emancipation, love, sex, desire, the subject, freedom, anxiety, consciousness, etc. In my opinion the modern victim stance, the modern claustrophobia that confines scientific discourse is the misconception that the universe is fully determinate, that all we are are material automata, freedom is an illusion etc. Hegel would formulate what I called ""failure"" as the groundlessness of being. Insofar as there is no god, there is no ground for Being. I would formulate this the exact way you did: Being indifferently is, there is no ground for it, there is no meaningful ground that ""causes being"" like God. Being is and you can't go further than that. Thus, the failure that I described isn't so much the failure of God while creating the universe, but God's failure to even exist in the first place. You could say that the thing-in-itself is the location where God won't stop not existing, where the ground of being won't stop not being there, where the thing-in-itself is pure indeterminacy. I like Hegel's way of putting it when describing the death of God as ""the abyss of nothingness in which all being sinks"". This sounds terrible, but it is at the same time only from this ""abyss of nothingness"" that the Subject is possible at all. If the universe wasn't a ""failure"" in this way the Subject wouldn't exist at all.",1,1580176254,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/euyk7o/is_the_death_of_god_kants_thinginitself_kant/,philosophy,1
eux6hu,Spangled_Metaphysics,Potentially starting Phi Sigma Tau at my university. Can chapters alter national eligibility requirements?,"I'm considering founding Phi Sigma Tau, the international philosophy honor society at my university. It meets all of the national requirements for chapter formation, so I was genuinely surprised to find out that it is not currently established at my school, considering it is one of the better public schools in my state while others have it.

My primary question concerns member eligibility. According to the Wikipedia page for the society claims that member eligibility is variable on a chapter by chapter basis, but on the national HQ website, the official undergraduate eligibility is:

&gt; Undergraduate students are eligible for active membership if they have completed three semesters or five quarters of the college course, rank in the upper thirty-five percent of their class, and have completed at least two semester courses or three quarter courses in philosophy with an average grade of over the second highest grade of the working scale. 

Is it a set-in-stone requirement, or is it truly variable? As my school's philosophy undergraduate pop is not huge, I would ideally like to alter it slightly (with dept permission of course) to something more inclusive to Philosophy majors who might not have the 35% class ranking, but have a set Major GPA in philosophy (such as a 3.75 for example) 

I could of course, argue this position in a philosophical manner if need be.",1,1580170194,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eux6hu/potentially_starting_phi_sigma_tau_at_my/,philosophy,1

euvqxx,BenjaminNormanPierce,Any hypothesis about the era of rapid decay we are in,"Here is my latest hypothesis. A major reason why the world is falling into spiraling disorder with epic power-grabs and colossal acts of collective self-sabotage as the main responses to and drivers of that disorder, quite simply, is that there has been a massive failure in a former ability we had to compartmentalize.

There has never been, in my view, a decent, sane, or fair society yet, but some of them have had periods of functionality that allowed aspects of decency, sanity, fairness, and even progress to manifest in some areas or among some populations, even sustainably or advanceably so. Yet the worst behaviors continued, in individual lives, families,communities, subcultures and total systems. Some of the apparently best or at least most contributing individuals did or at least contemplated some of the worst things. The worst still put up partitions around the evils and vices that were their routine reason for getting up in the morning. Only rarely did anyone shit in the dining hall, and something was done when it happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Not now. The behaviors are not new, and even the scale may not have increased so much as the venues where it is allowed: blatant obstruction, sabotage and treason in all levels of government, with public applause just so long as the right target population is distressed or harmed. Psychotically delusional narratives posing as theories, learning or thought. Actual physical sabotage, both collateral to business-as-usual and as directly-undertaken action. And so on.

&amp;#x200B;

It always happened, but it was compartmentalized and perhaps kept smaller, certainly less universally-consequential. Now, as I have said, all venues are open for the worst behaviors with the fruits of the better behaviors in the cross-hairs along with the sustainability of the daily actions that keep the world we have made put together: because we no longer compartmentalize.

&amp;#x200B;

Why? I haven't gotten that far yet. Blame the internet. Or blame it all on the moon.",1,1580164377,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/euvqxx/any_hypothesis_about_the_era_of_rapid_decay_we/,philosophy,1

eulymh,redditrando250,"Found a claim that Bertrand Russell believed in ""man made plagues,"" fatal sports, and feminization of men for purposes of pop control and so they won't create unrest in the world. What is the truth of this claim","I found an old topic about how conspiracy theorists had gotten ahold of Bertrand Russell and taken many of his quotes from The Impact of Science on Society out of context about what a scientifically advanced Soviet Union type of government could do to its population in order to create ridiculous conspiracy theories. Well, I found a very confusing response that says yes, that's true about The Impact of Science on Society, and yes, those conspiracy theorists are crazy, but when it comes his other book, The Scientific Outlook, those ""crazies"" are right about Russell, and that he advocated for some of the crazy stuff in the title of this thread. [Here is the topic in question](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/9025/what-did-russell-intend-to-achieve-with-the-impact-of-science-on-society). Scroll down for ""Big Dave""'s comment. I quote:

&gt;Bertrand Russell understood implicitly that ALL western societies are oligarchies masquerading as democracies. Huxley also spoke about this fact. make no mistake, the crazy folk are right about this man. in his book The Scientific Outlook he espouses both the ideas that population could be controlled by letting loose man made plagues in every generation and convincing men to kill themselves in some kind of sport for which they would receive great honour. he also so alludes to the need for men to be feminised more so that they wont cause unrest in their new world, which would go some way to explaining the rise of the Estrogenic Male

There are no responses to his comment, no context, so there's nothing to go on. I don't want to have to read that book right now to understand wtf he's talking about, but as a believer in science myself, I also cannot write off his wild claims until I know what he's referring to and what Russell either believed or he misread. Obviously, the latter is far more likely, but I want to know what he's referring to.

eu2d6y,DylanKieresCreative,I have a theory/question on reality,"I have a theory that we share a hive mind with the universe. This theory of mine is based on the science of biocentrism. This science states that nothing but waves of probability exist when not being observed by a biological observer. 

For my theory let’s say that a god exists, not any god in particular, or let’s say the universe is god. 

Now, things and events do keep happening without a worldly biological observer. 

It is obvious that we all share a reality. I sleep at night yet when I wake up tomorrow the earth will have rotated so that I see the sun when I wake up, depending on weather, but the sun will still be facing my location on the planet when it wasn’t 8 hours earlier. 

I say that the universe is in constant observation of what goes on inside and outside of itself. Now if we share a reality and that reality keeps happening while I and say 1000 other people in 1001 population community are sleeping, and the sun “rises” the next morning on me and my other 1000 friends, then we in fact are not the main observers but instead share a reality with the constant observer, the universe.

Now, my question is two parted: 1) do you think a god is needed for this theory to be true? 2) what are your thoughts on my theory?

I can provide some sources for those interested in the science of biocentrism and wanting to know more about my basis for my theory.",1,1580014461,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eu2d6y/i_have_a_theoryquestion_on_reality/,philosophy,1

Let me define to treat as to consciously behave in regard to others in a spectrum between behave for the other benefits and behave for your own benefit. Not sure if i'm clear in this point, sry, english is not my fist language

Now, how do we have a conscious? As we evolved from chimps we are social animals. It allow us to navigate our everyday more complex social interactions. Those who had a stronger conscious survived.

How should we treat others? In order for our genes to persist we should treat our children well, so that they may continue expreding our genes once we are gone and continue to pursue the objective of life.

How should we treat others that are not our children? Our siblings do share must of our genes, so it may be a good investment to treat them well , but not as much as our children. 


Our neighbours used to be genetically closer, way back in the day people use to live all their life on the same town and as such everyone was more or less related to one another. But now our neighbour may be from a different continent. How should we treat someone we are not related? Certainly not as good as we treat our siblings. We are in a competitive environment, resources are finite and we should prioritize  our children and siblings on the hand out of them. Only after we had succeeded in satisfy to the fullest their needs and wants we should start worrying about unrelated neighbours and start considering the needs and wants of other humans and humanity as a whole.

How should we treat the not human? Again, only after we satisfy to the fullest their needs and wants we should start worrying about not humans. Perhaps starting with monkeys.",1,1579967212,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/etsaqh/how_should_we_treat_the_other/,philosophy,1

ets1e2,Philmasterkill_69,Topic: Opinions can't be wrong,"So first of all sorry for possible mistakes, repetition of simmilar words etc. I'm not a native speaker. I hope you understand me nonetheless.


This has been bugging me for a few weeks now and I think I need an outside perspective. I'm no philosopher, just a teenager interrested in politics.


So far, I believed that there are opinions and facts. If someone said: ""in my opinion, there are 5 american presidents in office at the same time"" they simply used the word ""opinion"" incorrectly. Since it can be disproven or proven directly, it's a fact or a false statement. An opinion doesn't make a clame to truth and is only your way of looking at things, by definition. What opinions are based on, doesn't matter. With the same base of facts/whatever you base your opinion on, you can develope different opinions. How you get to your opinion and your opinion itself isn't the same thing, so this doesn't interfer with the provable/disprovable part. Even if the initial fact your opinion was based on can be disproven, this doesn't devalue your opinion. But is it ""not wrong"" now? Can every sentence be an opinion? And if so, how do we distinguish them from beliefs, facts and knowledge in day to day conversations? (truisms like ""in my opinion"" don't work in this argumentation, as stated above)


But then I thought, truth and falsehood can't always be determined. Who says what's wrong and what is right? Therefore, to say ""opinions don't clame to be true"" is the only thing you can say. But this is very dissatisfying. And it only gives a squishy explanation for ""opinions can't be wrong"" - You'd only say, that they don't make a clame to truth and therefore you can't factor this in and that's it. Like saying ""the number 3 is yellow"" it's just a nonsensical statement. Is this really it? And what if this nonsensical statement is there opinion? Wouldn't this destroy my argumentation and expose me as a hypocrite?


Using both argumentations, opinions can't be wrong. In the first one, because not everything is an opinion and the word is simply not used correctly. In the second one, because opinions don't pose claims to truth (although this is already part of the first argumentation)

etmqag,Vanilla52,"Sophistry is the new superpower in the modern world, and Platonic Good has no place in our society- change my mind... please...","First post here, so please go easy on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a major man-crush on Plato, and his book The Republic has been the guiding force in my life.  That's enough backstory to understand where I'm coming from- I think.

&amp;#x200B;

We find ourselves surrounded by lies.  True, it's always been that way- but we knew the lies were lies.  When we saw the Doctors endorsing cigarettes- we still called them cancer sticks.  When Cosmo magazine released an article about how eating only fast-food can result in a sexier waistline... we also knew it was a bunch of malarkey.  But at some point, our ability to lie has surpassed our ability to detect said lies.  I think, mostly, this is evident in the political sphere.

&amp;#x200B;

One side says there's nothing we can do about the climate, the other says we can only save the Earth if we act 4 years ago- but we can still aim for a dystopia that isn't entirely death.  People on both sides of the political spectrum raise their arms and call the other side whichever dastardly name they can.  All the while, this Machiavellian distraction has prevented them from the major outrages they should be possessing.

&amp;#x200B;

In the Platonic world, the Good is the Good is the Good.  To know the Good is to do the Good.  These days, the Good seems to not exist in either sales pitch- and yet we seemed forced to pick a path.

&amp;#x200B;

Plato says further, that when it comes to affairs of the state... you have 3 choices.  You can follow the Law, you can run for government yourself, or you can leave.  Disobedience is not one of the choices he proposes- probably because that would be unfair/unjust/not Good.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I think a world in which multiple Ring of Gyges (a magical ring which would allow you to become invisible at will- but for my intents represents your ability to make your unjust intentions invisible) was probably beyond Plato's writing... and the book does an amazing job despite how outdated it is... but the reality is, we live in a strange time.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had the thought that I want to pretend I'm a racist to make money selling stuff to other racists, and in that same breath (different corporation) sell t-shirts to ANTIFA and the radical left.  I could go to as many churches as possible (without tithing/donating a thing), and join every faction/group possible in order to maximize my cashflow.  (Insert argument against hedonism, thus why I didn't do it.. extra points if you get the MAXIMUM FLOW reference to cashflow)

&amp;#x200B;

But that thought lead me down a dark rabbit hole.  You see, if you have a thought- it's probably not original.  In fact, many other people have probably had this thought already.  I started to look at these causes... for example, I saw a comic of a man holding 2 rifles and a pistol being surrounded by a mixed race couple, a gay couple, random brown guy, and just some other people with him saying out loud, ""I'm offended.""

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately, I felt like I need to rally the brainiac-troops to Facebook keyboard and attack the heathens trying to spread such malarkey... ignoring the fact that every share advertises this guy's shitty cartoon.   I don't even agree with it, and I'm helping him out.  I started to think more.  The people that share the cartoon gain a sense of community.  They gain people they believe are friends (Gyges Ring, ahem) and they believe- a way to detect evildoers.  Much like the people against it also get those same false senses.  Believe it or not, your belief in the value of a cartoon doesn't tell you anything else about your fellow man.  

&amp;#x200B;

I thought further...

&amp;#x200B;

This is ingrained in everything today.  You can't turn on a TV show without seeing it.  For the sake of argument I'm going to go to [CNN.com](https://CNN.com) and [FOXNEWS.com](https://FOX.com) and see what each of their top articles are at this moment (Jan 24, 2020).

&amp;#x200B;

"" [GOP thinking on impeachment: It's the defense team's to lose](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/24/politics/republican-senators-reaction-impeachment/index.html)""

and

"" [EXCLUSIVE: Trump shares advice for defense team as Dems conclude opening Senate trial arguments](https://www.foxnews.com/media/president-trump-tells-ingraham-angle-all-his-impeachment-defense-team-has-to-do-is-just-be-honest-just-tell-the-truth)""

&amp;#x200B;

Wow, that worked out better than expected.  Their top story is about an identical situation, yet the perspective guarantees an alternate story.  One shows the arrogance of the Republican party thinking they can't possibly lose... the other tells the story of a courageous general, sharing his war-advice with the troops (maybe reaching a bit far, but you know what I'm saying).

&amp;#x200B;

And although this kind of political partisan stuff in the media is not new... it's never been regarded as blanket truths before.  Back in my day, we had Jon Stewart to point out the absurdity of the News.  Although it can be argued that Jon was very left-leaning... I think he still attacked the Left a fair amount.  I don't think Noah is even close to his level, and although Noah is funny- it is not the same show it once was.

&amp;#x200B;

My whole reason for writing this big long story is to display how I believe the world no-longer makes sense in terms of accomplishing what you set out to do.  Thus, sophists are running-a-muck and what they say is the true power in society... is.   In our society, if you're playing to be one of the ""Good Guys,"" you're getting it wrong.  You're going to be eaten alive by Thrasymachus.

&amp;#x200B;

 Sophistry states:

1. Justice is nothing but the advantage of the stronger
2. Justice is obedience to laws
3. Justice is nothing but the advantage of another

&amp;#x200B;

Strength in our society can be measured by economic power.

Obeying the laws is now grey area.  We have functions like ""Not Criminally Responsible"" and subjective takes on the law... like people openly smoking marijuana despite what the law of the land is.  But, they appear to be obedient... so they get away with it.

Finally, the advantage of others is all we seem focused on.  Instagram is one giant competition.  Epstein is one of the most famous/powerful pedos ever... but somehow skated by.  Thus, he was viewed Justly (seen happily in pics with Bill Clinton and Trump - two ""Just"" figureheads).

&amp;#x200B;

In a moment i may think A is the anwser for X, but when someone who believes that B is the anwser, i listen to them, and B makes total sense with their explaination, but then again if i listen to another person that claims C is the most optimal way, i again think to myself ""he has a point"". Im talking about grand scale things like racism, religion, feninism, political leaning etc.

And after a while of listening to different people and asking for advice, i realized that everyone of them is biased in their worldview. But its not that they are just biased, its that everything that they read, see and hear will pass their own filter, and only the ""facts"" that they believe in are coming through. Not ignoring, but straight up not seeing other perspectives unltil explained to. And even then, its like they search for reasons they are right or that the others are wrong.

Its almost like humans cant possibly understand whats true and whats not because of our own biases formed by our individual paths the world has put us through. I know this sounds very sudo enlightened, and maybe it is, but I seriously need some stuff explained because right now i feel totally lost. I have no goal infront of me, and when im trying to find one, I ultimately decide that this goal is not the right one because there are logical arguments against it.",1,1579873031,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/etai5a/arent_basicly_all_worldviews_and_opinions_black/,philosophy,1

et3yhj,It_Was_Joao,Why did the chicken cross the road?,"Why did the chicken cross the road? Because it wanted to get to the other side. Well… why did it want to get to the other side? Because it was hungry and hoped it would find food on the other side of the road. Why was it hungry? That’s because the chicken wasn’t being fed by the farm owner. Why wasn’t the chicken getting fed by the farm owner? Because a couple weeks ago the chicken made one of the most important decisions of its life, to run away from the farm. Why did it run away from the farm? Because it witnessed its parents being killed by the farm owner. Why did the chicken’s parents end up in that farm? Because their parents, grandparents, great-grandparents and their great-grandparents’s parents and grandparents were grown, fed, treated, and then killed by the farm owners. So technically, the chicken didn’t cross the road because it was hungry, it crossed the road because its great-great-great-great grandparents decided not to run away from the farm.
    
Well, yes, but actually no. Chickens’ late ancestors are dinosaurs, chickens only came to become chickens because of the extinction of the dinosaurs. So technically, the chicken didn’t cross the road because it was hungry, but because a random huge asteroid killed off the world’s dinosaur population. Well, yes, but actually no. The asteroid only came to become an asteroid because our solar system was created, and there was leftover dust and rocks from the formation of our solar system. So technically, the chicken didn’t cross the road because the asteroid killed the dinosaurs, but because our solar system was created 4.6 billion years ago. Well, yes, but actually no. Our solar system only came to become a solar system because a bunch of particles were grouped together too tight and went BOOM 10-20 billion years ago, creating our universe. So technically, the chicken didn’t cross the road because it was hungry, but because our universe was created 10-20 billion years ago. Well, yes, but actually no one knows, no one truly knows what caused our universe to be created, so technically, no one truly knows why the chicken crossed the road.

    While the chicken technically didn’t cross the road because it was hungry, at that moment, all that was in its mind was getting food. It didn’t think about all the billions or trillions of years of backstory that had to happen just for that chicken to be at that street, at that exact time, feeling that exact way. It thinks two things, “I’m hungry, and there might be food on the other side of this road, therefore my only option is to cross this road.” The only difference between this chicken and me, is that I have the power to consciously analyze all the backstory that had to happen just so I could write this story. Just like the chicken, we act on impulse, and we are not constantly reminded about the fact that all of our past, present, and future actions have already been determined billions or trillions of years ago. We act on impulse because as interesting and sad as this realization might be, we still have to live our life, just like the chicken. We act on impulse because even though our actions have already been planned, we still consciously decide to do what we want to do, eat what we want to eat, talk to who we want to talk, or more importantly, do something illegal when we want to do something illegal. That’s why the argument that “life doesn’t matter because we have no free will” is a weak and false argument, because we have been blessed with a conscience, and our actions have been planned surrounding that incredibly special idea. So, is determinism wrong? Well, yes, but actually no, because even though the outcome was already planned billions or trillions of years ago, we still feel like we can make our own decisions, and the universe scoffs at us. The only difference between you and the chicken is that you can think about this essay, and decide to ignore it or accept it.",0,1579833467,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/et3yhj/why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road/,philosophy,1

This book is a reflective journey into the pursuit of the spiritual needs of human beings. It is not based on any religion or ideology, but it has been influenced by many of them. It focuses on the core needs that are found in most spiritual practices and gives an introduction to each need. From Love to Uncertainty to Significance, the reader encounters each fundamental need from a supportive and vulnerable approach. This book seeks to encourage the reader on a journey to figure these core needs together with the author. The author aims to lead the reader into in-depth spiritual topics with openness so that the reader may choose to open themselves up to these difficult areas of conversation. The book has many life stories from the author and his journey from a Christian Seminary student to an open-minded, spiritual seeker. It has been dubbed a ""Philosophical Memoir.""

esm1xk,phlycat,There is no free choice. Based on science.,"I have my own theory (don't know if anyone else has thought of it before) that there is no such thing as free choice. But it isn't based on religion, rather science. I'm already sorry for my terrible way of trying to explain it, I'm not a scientist or a speech person.

&amp;#x200B;

To understand this, first thing to note is every thought and emotion that happens in your brain, every action you decide to take, all of that happens through physical things like neurons and electrons in the brain. Even though it might feel like thoughts come out of thin air, they don't. 

Everything you do, knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, happens through 100% physical matter (of course unless you're religious and believe in a soul)

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing to note is that every molecule in our bodies and all other living creatures are stardust that is found generously throughout the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

The third thing to note is everything in life, from the beginning, has a ripple/butterfly effect. Meaning there is a space-time continuum. If you rip a paper into shreds it won't magically appear whole next minute.

&amp;#x200B;

If all the above is true (which it is according to science) then if the big bang happened at exactly the same conditions, (just the initial explosion) then everything in the universe would end up in exactly the same place. 

For it to be different, the conditions have to be different too, the slightest change could change the course of the whole known universe completely and permanently. 

So without any change to the initial explosion, everything turns out the way they already have.

&amp;#x200B;

That means all of the heat distributed to the same places at the same temperatures and the same clouds of gas formed because the conditions were exactly the same with no differentiating matter. 

This means the galaxies that were born from it would also be in the exact same positions at the exact same time with every atom in the universe being in the same place it has been in our timeline. 

Including the atoms that make our planet, that gave way to life, the atoms that make you would be in the exact same order, and everything that happened in history would play out exactly the same. 

Every human who was ever born would experience the same things, think the same things, and take the same action they did in this timeline one-to-one.

&amp;#x200B;

So, maybe there is no free choice at all, but all our lives were outcomes of how a speck in nothingness exploded, and how the aftermath of that explosion is one ripple effect to the next.

The only escape from this is if we had an infinite amount of universes with infinitely different explosions so that the aftermath is different each time, but even then, you would never have more than one timeline to choose between.

So if you're living in a timeline that you made really good decisions and end up successful but you die at an early age, tough luck. Same as any other possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't know if I explained myself properly but I hope you get the message.",1,1579743977,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/esm1xk/there_is_no_free_choice_based_on_science/,philosophy,1
esl7fw,colorsounds,Defining a Desire for Hidden Knowledge - Being Chosen By God,"Well I didn’t know where else to turn to so I’ll turn here.

Time and time again in my life I run up against this idea of hidden knowledge or a desire for hidden knowledge, a certainty of God or knowledge etc, that is gained through what seems to be some kind of spiritual or supernatural sources.

In psychedelic experiences I often would run into the theme of being chosen and getting some kind of hidden knowledge certainty something that I would obtain and be able to share with those around me or the world.

A supernaturally obtained power or knowledge that helps others. 

Then today I read something by Soman Chainani that said “ I think the greatest exercise a person can do when they’re stuck is to remember what their favorite children’s book was. A book that you read over and over and over again. somewhere in that book is the clue to not only what makes you tick, but also to your life‘s purpose.”

So for me there was this church video (I grew up Mormon) about this guy named Ammon and it had a similar theme where he went to a dangerous place with these brutal people because God told him to and he defends the sheep of the king and then he tells the king about God and its a miracle.

This was my favorite and I related so much with this on a deep level. 

Certainty seems to be a common theme here as well. 

Now I know I’m not really alone and I know there’s a lot of people that have similar experiences. But I’ve just seen the same theme over and over again in my life and I wanted to get an idea in psychology is there a term for this? Is there more literature in this direction? I’ve been reading a lot of Jung but I haven’t seen anything specifically about this in dreams or the hero myth.

es6dsg,WoodHeadPhones,Question about morality and being kind to others.,"First off I really don't want to seem like I'm trying to say to everyone, ""hey look at how nice I am to people.""

That's not the point at all, sorry if it comes across like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to explain a thing or two before I ask my question.

I try to often be what people commonly call being ""kind"" to people. If I'm at a dance, instead of dancing with the most ""attractive"" girl I will dance with the girl who seems like she is lonely, and doesn't have friends around. I very often compliment people on random things like their clothes, shoes, etc.

I do these things because I know how I feel when people do things like this for me. I know I like to be treated kindly. So in my kind, I don't have a choice. It's the right thing to do in my mind, and I have no choice but to do it. No matter how I feel, I have a duty to help those around me. That's my mindset at least (I'm not saying any of these things are more than just my opinion)

So, I feel like I have a **duty** to do these things. It's like I reacted with the outside world, and the product of this reaction is me *having* to be kind to others. Now, in a way I want to help them, as in I desire to, but there's also a huge aspect of duty. So my question is this: If I feel a duty to help others, to be kind, can they really thank me? Can they really be like, ""wow, you're a genuinely nice Human being""

I have no choice, really. I **have** to help others. Couldn't it be said that to an extent, I'm not doing it out of my genuine concern and care, and therefore don't deserve credit? Do my actions **count** if I feel like I have a duty to do them, and do it because I feel I must do so a lot of the time? This is my question.

I acknowledge that there may very well be large flaws in any of my reasoning.

 I often think about the meaning of life and reality. In the last couple of months I thought a lot about 'why are we born' and 'whats our porpuse as an ""individual""'. 

So I looked at this topic from different perspectives and got stuck with the biological way of interpreting the meaning of life. So the main goal of a species is to survive and secure the existence of the species. To do so, they develop and advance their knowledge, especially in modern context. So if I take a look on modern humanity, the most important thing to do for every human being should be to develop modern science and to procreate themselves. By that  Iam convinced that you can rate the worth of a person by looking at what they are doing to achieve these two main goals of humanity as a species. Furthermore would people who have koitus for fun, abandon the main goal of their species to trade it for joy and comfort of the individual.",1,1579655089,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/es4cyr/the_meaning_of_life_and_koitus_from_an/,philosophy,1

es3qc1,Phytom,Should we keep Democracy?,"I'm from Switzerland, in practice the most democratic country on earth - and I'm seriously concerned with it. 

""Democracy is the worst form of Government - Except for all the others."" -Winston Churchill

I've always hated this quote because I was a 100% Soc-Dem. I believed that the individual was capable of critical thinking and reasoning. **But this has changed dramatically...**

The masses are not capable of critical thinking, they are consumed by instincts. Put more than 100 people in a society and they will follow not their brain, but their instincts. 

**The human brain is constructed to think of itself as the thing that develops its own opinions. And THIS is the reason why Democracy does NOT work.** 

Your brain, same as mine, do NOT develop their own opinions. They are constructed by advertisement and modern propaganda. Why do you buy coke - even though you like Dr.Peppers more? Why do you buy Whiskey, even though you like Cocktails more? It's because the Media - Advertisements - Culture, etc. have conditioned you to think that Whiskey is more manly than a Bloody Mary. And the same is true for almost everything else you hold an opinion about - it is constructed.

And the only way you can challenge these things is if you except that you are more vulnerable to deception than you think, and that your brain is already filled with war-propaganda and advertisement. 

And in this age, where academics all over the world are beginning to doubt the ""supremacy"" of Democracy, is where we should take stand against this. Why do none of our schools teach Philosophy, Psychology, Public Relations, etc? Why do we still have the same fucking school system since the German Reich - WHILE LIVING IN A DEMOCRACY!?

The most vital subject - in a democracy - should be Politics. Learning about Propaganda, Deception, interpreting speeches, knowing 100% what each party stands for - each current political figure stands for, what the EU is, what Russia is, what China is - devoid of all opinions. Just straight facts. And when the children leave school, they are prepared to partake in a democracy, are immune to deceptions - either from people like Donald Trump OR the establishment. 

It's no wonder that systems like China and Russia are taking over - they have clever people that lead the country - while in a Democracy, the leaders are the people. We don't need to teach our children that the Adenosine triphosphate (**ATP**) is a nucleotide used in cells as a coenzyme. - We need to teach them what the hell is happening in the world - Modern forms of deception, manipulation and propaganda, and how the PEOPLE are ruling over the Government, not the other way around.

What does the man-made simulation have in common with our simulation?

What do man made simulations have in common with each other? They're all light or heat as with a lava lamp.

In what way are humans light, if we are matter?

I imagine another universe of intelligent lines may exist, lines that can program space, (I know this one is 'out there', but you can easily conceptualize such intelligent lines.)

Generally I want to discuss what simulation is.

The universe has structure, but it is vast, I wouldn't say structure was round to amount.

I hypothesize that only local universe plays a role in our simulation, planets are like giant simulations with a core Sun simulations.

This tells me projection in simulation is party about heat.

I seriously debated just giving it to my kids (when they are much much older) and leaving it at that. But alas, here it is...

This book is a reflective journey into the pursuit of the spiritual needs of human beings. It is not based on any religion or ideology, but it has been influenced by many of them. It focuses on the core needs that are found in most spiritual practices and gives an introduction to each need. From Love to Uncertainty to Significance, the reader encounters each fundamental need from a supportive and vulnerable approach. This book seeks to encourage the reader on a journey to figure these core needs together with the author. The author aims to lead the reader into in-depth spiritual topics with openness so that the reader may choose to open themselves up to these difficult areas of conversation. The book has many life stories from the author and his journey from a Christian Seminary student to an open-minded, spiritual seeker. It has been dubbed a ""Philosophical Memoir.""

If the earth rotation (spin) is slowing down, (aprx. causing our days to extend 1.7milliseconds per 100 years) one could argue that the increase in longer days forces the sun to increase its time spent shining on the ice that is melting. This would also mean it would over time get increasingly worse. it could also explain why our ice has been melting for a large period of time, and is speeding up. 

I'd like to think that 1.7ms per 100 years is a number that increases like money in an interest savings account. I'm open to discussions, I'd love to hear any supporting / opposing evidence of this.

eroq4s,FishyTravels,Explaining why sudden change causes overwhelming stimulation to parents.,"The reason autistics can’t cope with sudden change is becuase the reality of what **reality** is, is suddenly morphed into a new one without shared knowledge. It’s like living in an air-conditioned house and then suddenly living in the desert when your body has no ability based on its environmental learning capabilities (also known as adaptation).

Define **reality** as: *“incoming physical and ideological concepts stimulating your senses and mind.”* For example: When understood, it’s seems like no stimulation, like a fast moving boat progressing through a smooth river. But for us, when we don’t understand the incoming concepts of reality, it’s like the current reverses to an overwhelmingly strong surge and paddling against it is a joke. 

We cannot figure things out unless we see how all the parts fit together. 

For you and other people, the abrupt change of moving a chair in the kitchen isn’t so abrupt and your reality is barely changed. But because we do not understand “the reality that you never explained” there is a huge reality difference for us because you never explained the dynamic of how chairs are moved and how that doesn’t completely change the room or it’s purpose. 

We similar-brained “aspergerians” don’t just act according to how we assumptively balance the observed amount of violence taking place and justify our actions relating directly with a class of subservience and reduced risk. Without our own permission, our brains reduce all logic to the most basic concepts possible, with a sprinkle of doubt to increase constant definition of the concepts granted a place in fundamental space. In order to speak, we can’t simply use simple words. Our thoughts are too complex. We must consume information like air and we suffer when it is deprived. Like when you think I’m playing stupid and deprive the answers to my questions I ask just to understand you and what you want. I hate words. Since I was five at least, even I if I believed I was certain about a truth I would still try to explain it further because there is always another deeper concept about that reality. For us, there is no ground to stand on. A single truth is a constantly expanding universe. Starts out as a witnessed mass of concepts that we struggle to define and as we continue to define the original concepts learned they grow and become more complex when in reality we are just learning the idea through it’s process of reveal that depends on my own relationship to the idea broadening it’s own meaning. 

You see, to us, we know that we are witnessing the idea (metaphorically seen as the universe) expanding outward in all directions over time but we also depersonalize and realize that the idea is already fully expanded, and we are just the substrate to witness the idea spawn its web through time, as if validating the subject’s existence. 

So to you an idea may seem like the bedrock of its reality has a stopping point, but that stopping point can only end with “because god made it that way”. So since I see god as the potential of infinite creation (which seems more demonic to me), I know that concepts of fundament do not end there and that the ideas just seem dissipate to an end beyond our comprehension. Which is funny somehow. 

You have to analyze information and understand it in a much deeper way because those concepts you reduced the idea to is more of a true relatable fundament of how we understand information. To us, what is observed by our senses is “common sense”. It is not practiced ideas or actions that somehow create reality by becoming common apart from our obviously-witnessed literal structure for information. 

Regular people understand information at a level that isn’t so fundamental because for some reason they seem incapable of understanding smaller pieces of a bigger puzzle. Which to me doesn’t make sense because everything, especially man-made culture can be reduced to fundamental concepts of suggestion. 

We understand reality at each of its most fundamental principles and when the situation changes those principles are moved and exchanged with new ones but when those new ones are not explained we are operating in a world that is unknown (overstimulation). The floor, walls, and air could be fake as far as we know until we are told the boundaries of their existence and why. When people don’t know why, we wonder where their merit is for explaining information.",0,1579577133,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eroq4s/explaining_why_sudden_change_causes_overwhelming/,philosophy,1

ermuez,mackenzen,Try to poke holes in my controversial philosophy...,"It is my goal in life to be happy. If an opportunity is presented to me I think about if it will make me happy in the short or long term. If something makes me happy in the short term but NOT the long term I have to consider if it is worth doing such as: eating a dessert tastes good now but I may not feel great in the morning, or if I eat it every day I might become overweight and unhealthy.
Conversely, if something is difficult or trifling in the short term but will make me proportionately happy long term it may be worth doing, such as: working fulltime everyday for 10 years to have freedom in retirement for the rest of my life.

I fully acknowledge that this set of ideals is seen as self indulgent or selfish. To that I say, it is not a coincidence that those who give all they can give of themselves tend to find themselves in difficult situations. I spent a time bouncing between abusive and toxic relationships. I was a partner in a co-dependent situation. I gave all I could to this person and at the end of the day I was drained and depressed. I not only gave all I could in romantic relationships but also with family and in a work environment. 
Secondly, I take care of myself and fulfill all of my basic needs as well as everything I need to maximize my happiness. If when I am done with that I have time and energy to give to others I will. 

Putting yourself first, in my opinion, is important for self care. I dont view it as a negative. 

When a person takes advantage of another, THAT is a problem. 

The anology I like to pose is: If you were homeless, penniless, and hungry, would you give away your meal? 
There is a pyramid I imagine we all have. At the bottom is the most important, our basic needs like, food, shelter, etc. 
In the middle is comfort. This includes things we dont NEED to survive but are nice to have. Things like hot showers, clean clothes, etc.
The top of the pyramid is happiness. You dont need anything from the middle of the pyramid to reach the top but in my experience it helps. 
If you require free time in your day to relax to be happy why would you sacrifice your time to a soul sucking job or to a neighbor that needs the sink fixed in their house. By all means if you find happiness in helping your neighbor then do it. If on the other hand, you would rather be home then take solace in the fact that you did not cause their problem and it is their responsibility to fix it or pay to have it fixed. 
With a life lived as I am living mine it is important to practice what you preach. Do not expect help from others when you are not willing to give it yourself. Plan to live self sufficiently or you will be labeled selfish.

I am trying to find (a) relatively basic and (b) free or not hugely expensive sources for the following utilitarian claims: 

(1) One has a moral commitment to sacrifice one's life if it would save multiple others'. 

(2) One has a moral commitment to sacrificing/ending life early if it would prolong the lives of enough others. 

(3) Expensive critical care measures which only marginally prolong life, and prolong lives of the already elderly, are wrong. 

I realize these claims do not represent all utilitarians, but per my understanding they represent some. I just am having a difficult time finding actual sources (which are not whole books, or complicated responses to existing articles, or behind a very steep paywall). 

Thanks for any assistance! And it's for a paper, so if you'd like credit for helping me just DM me your name?

er0pc7,EffortlessWave,Reality is Emptiness,"1. All space is ultimately empty

2. If (1) then reality is emptiness

3. Reality is emptiness


Rationale: This is based off of the observations of modern physicists. Basically all atoms are 99.999% empty space, and the subatomic particles that constitute the other 0.001% are made up of more space and subatomic phenomena such as wavelets / quarks. 

Even these wavelets and quarks are ultimately empty or non-solid. 

The truth is that everything is empty, even that which appears to occupy space is in itself empty as-well. 

Reality is perceived to contain solid objects yet in reality it is all empty. Empty space is everywhere. 

Reality is emptiness, yet it is perceived to be full.

What fills the emptiness, Light, yet light is non-solid. It is a phenomenon like ripples on water. Waves. Waves that traverse the expanse of empty space.

Potential objections and responses:

Objection one: reality is not empty because even those particles/the walls of the particles must contain some element of solidity.

Response one: in light of the observations made by quantum physicists all particles when not being observed become waves. Thus all particles, all matter is waves, reality is non-solid. Formless on the ultimate level.

Objection two: it is impossible for reality to be empty because it is observed that there is stuff. There is no way we can observe stuff if there is no-stuff.

Response two: reality is empty yet we can still observe stuff because we as the observers are that which create the illusion or perception of there being solidity. It is the mind or consciousness which creates the perception of a solid reality, when in truth what is being observed is a soup of vibration and waves which is then constructed into a seemingly solid reality within the mind.

Objection three: reality cannot be empty because we the observer are something solid.

Response three: the truth is that even we, or the common idea of what we think we are (these bodies we observe reality through) are empty. 

This can be verified by the observations of science. Along with the observations of Yogis and meditators. For they observe through the concentration of awareness the formless reality.

We are ultimately empty vessels full of light.

We get kids and try to teach them how to live right so we could feel important
We exploit people for our own benefit 


We created words like loyalty and nobility that do not work anymore in modern world. Yet we try to behave and follow social norms.

I feel sick from being a human. I am not different. I will accept it

But wait, i give it negative meaning, I decide it to be bad. What if this is just a trivial part of something and it must be this way. It may just be a way for us to develop.

eql7su,IcyHotRoad,"The Manipulated Man, I'm Speechless","Anyone else read this?

After noticing numerous mentions of this book pop up elsewhere, I decided to read for myself. Suffice to say, I finished it in just two days. It has left a irreversible mark of truth onto me. I have read many books that *moved* me, but Ms. Esther Vilar wrote one of the only pieces of literature that ever truly changed the way *I think*.  It's like having a third eye opened. Reading this was like listening to an alien's written report on the human species. Vaguely similar to Nietzsche and Schopenhauer (and she even makes a few mentions of them). She wrote it in the 70's Germany and she still receives death threats to this day and even left Europe to South America.

Her ideas about men and women, and ""masculinity"" and ""femininity"" as concepts are just so far out of bounds for ideas ANYONE had about the relationship between and within the sexes.

As I was reading it utterly shocked me at first, then I became angry, then I became sad...until it reaches a sort of nihilistic calmness and serenity, though a joyous sense of feeling relieved and  knowing you know the truth and that's all that matters. One of the ""lucky few"" to have glimpsed something you've never even conceived of or were even supposed to see, a tour through the backroom behind the curtains of the Wizard of Oz or inner workings straight to the hard drive and seeing the matrix, and the hopelessness upon realization that millions upon millions of unaware people will go about their lives in this way.

Everyone should read this, no doubt. Perhaps one of the most important books of the past few centuries or so with the likes of 1984, A Brave New World, or The Jungle.",1,1579376523,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eql7su/the_manipulated_man_im_speechless/,philosophy,1

eqjdh5,This_is_your_mind,Determinism,"I was doing a reading for class, and stumbled upon this statement:

&gt;The body's actions and engagements are never wholly determinate, since they must ceaselessly adjust themselves to a world and a terrain that is itself continually adjusting. [Context: Page 49](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lenKav_N_4uGAVEO2aaJHxPQ19dl9wrd/view?usp=sharing)

I find this train of thought insufficient to deject determinism. It sounds like the speaker here is saying that the only reason we can't be wholly determinate is that we are continuously adjusting/changing. But, I can think of myriad examples of continuous adjustments that are wholly determinate. 

Rest a ladder against a wall. Under it, you have a triangle of area. As the ladder slides down the wall, the are of the triangle continuously changes, ceaselessly adjusting itself to a continuously changing phenomenon. Yet, by constructing a differential equation, one can determine the exact area of the changing triangle or even the speed of changing area, based only on the speed of the ladder as well as some initial conditions (height, wall position, accel. of gravity). It follows, that the body **could be** (not trying to prove anything here, just saying that the evidence given is insufficient) entirely determinate based on rates and initial conditions. The speaker follows the statement with a proposition that if we were wholly determinate, we wouldn't have the capacity for surprise- surprise is still possible if the rates and initial conditions are unknown. Just because they are unknown, does not mean they don't exist.

The context is regarding 'lived experience' (immediacy)- it seems that the speaker is saying that because we can't be determined by static conditions, we can't be determined. But conditions don't have to be static- rates are wholly immediate.

But what happens is you don't get to understand true motives behind the individual who is campaigning or the government rather... Here in India, it's hard to make up a decision without having personal bias I suppose, since most of the politicians have heavy ties to crime... So basically you're voting for someone or something that you can't completely see but base trust on the self advertisements they put up in speeches and other ads. Which often leads to disagreements between the public and the particular administration on certain moves and legislation. Obviously all this is in theory but seems kind of accurate to me...

Which brings me to my real point, how are the people given the freedom to choose when they're only given options of different people n they're 'adverts'... Shouldn't there be some way for the public to vote on every decision?

eq2iyy,G1nnnn,Death really is not that bad - or am I wrong ?,"First of all, let me clarify a few things. Im neither depressed nor a teenager or have only had these thoughts for a few weeks.

Rather, since 2 Years ago, I started thinking that death is kind of, well, neutral. And IMO anybody who is not a theist also should think so. Because death is the ultimate nothing and nothing can hardly be placed into a good-bad scale.

&amp;#x200B;

This leads to me every now and then thinking about suicide for years, usually not doing it because of smth I want to finish first etc. Tried it once, failed, went back to where I started again. I have a good life, secure career, everything I could wish, but when there's no happiness, there's misery, and when there's misery, death would be superior, wouldnt it ?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I getting into some sort of fallacy here ? I really am afraid to talk to anybody I know personally about this since I do not ever want to be put on suicide watch or smth similar, I want to be free obviously. Are other people just always a little happy so that they don't see death as a superior choice or do they fear death so much / think death will result in something negative ?

epqfon,RobertDow8,future of public education,"As a former public school teacher and coach (26 years), I am writing a book about the future of public education. I want input on every level. Proficiency Based Education (PBE) clearly states that students need to show proficiency at one level/grade BEFORE moving on to the next. I don't agree with all aspects of PBE but this part makes total sense to me. 

	It is human nature that we all grow and learn at different rates, but what do we do at the end of every school year? We move students to the next grade REGARDLESS of whether or not they have shown proficiency at their current level. This creates learning gaps that the next teacher is expected to miraculously fill to get those students up to ""grade level."" 

	Also, the message sent to students is that they don't have to work hard to meet standards because they know that they will get passed on at the end of the year. One year we had a 7th grade student who completed maybe 20% of the required work for the year and in spite of teacher recommendation that he repeat the grade, administrators moved him to 8th grade, again sending a message that working hard does not matter, and that the curriculum that teachers work so hard to implement means nothing.

epfu70,ShabnamSingla,Taking Philosophy notes in class,"This might come off as something very basic but I'm genuinely concerned about how does/can one take notes in Philosophy classes effectively. 
(Given that the professors don't really teach in the form of lectures with concept maps etc., but just throw out random bits of info most of the times, the faculty is very new at my school)

What I've been doing so far is I write things being discussed in the class on a blank page and sort of try to make flow charts or pointers (which I feel is how I'm comfortable with grasping information in class) but all of it sort of gets mixed up when I read it again, it gets mixed up and I remember concepts etc but I miss the links or the flow. 

Also, on my own, if I try to read the texts (which I find difficult to concentrate on/stick to, although I really like engaging with the concepts), I get distracted by the act of wanting to take notes and retaining info or I lose track. Also, I feel like I'm wasting my time in my class since there's not much happening and then at home, I'm not left with the energy to do the whole thing on my own. 

I'm in my sophomore year and would love any kind of advice related to classroom learning or managing things on our own in Philosophy.",1,1579158177,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/epfu70/taking_philosophy_notes_in_class/,philosophy,1

epdb59,paintnate222,"Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Buddhism and Free Will.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7Yst8l51GY&amp;t=519s

The debate between Harris and Dennett comes down to a few questions for me: what is an agent? And, by extension, what does it mean to have agency? How does an agent differ from a ""self""? Both Harris and Dennett deny the self and agency in certain ways, and affirm its existence in others. They also both speak to a similar, deeper (dare I say spiritual?) understanding of Self. Dennett thinks that the notion of an agent is important, and I understand why. If some chess playing computer program beats all others 90% of time, we need to explain why. To say: ""well, A beats B, C and the rest because it was DETERMINED to do so!"" is a completely useless explanation. Program A was more competent than the rest, for various reasons, and even if it occasionally lost to the others (for a whole host of determined reasons), that doesn't mean that Program A isn't any more or less competent than the others. Free-will, as Dennett articulates, is moral competence: the response-ability to understand complex moral and social situations, and respond in such a way as to get the most out of life. Sometimes we fuck up, even when we are generally competent. There's also always room for improvement. But there's something fallacious about equating the fact that things (including human beings) have causes with a complete lack of control, or thinking determinism necessarily implies fatalism. Some people don't have response-ability and are thus morally incompetent, and that's unfortunate for them since they miss out on all sorts of powers: that's why we imprison the criminally insane, psychopaths who can't be rehabilitated, enable individuals to have power of attorney over others etc. But most of us are response-able (lucky us), and with that responsibility comes rights and a degree of power over our own lives (that is, we aren't controlled by other agents as in the previously mentioned cases).

Harris wants to get rid of the agent or self altogether, and I also agree that this is in one sense necessary. Nobody picks their genes or environmental upbringing, or the conditions which form their cognitive and emotional abilities to make accurate and useful judgments about the world and act accordingly (response-ability). I'm a social worker who's been in the field for over a decade, and this is painfully evident to me. Suffering and abuse are of a cyclical nature: abused children are at greater risk of substance use, eating disorders, suicide, and of abusing their own children. Suffering begets suffering, generation after generation, and it happens almost entirely unconsciously despite the fact that we think we're in the driver's seat. This is where Sam's love of eastern philosophy comes into play (I share this love): the key to real control over the psyche is to realize that there isn't really anyone in the driver's seat; that the self is an illusion of sorts that binds us to vanity, vice, and existential resentment/dissatisfaction. We aren't disjointed or separate from the causal fabric that connects all things. ""Suffering begets suffering, and can only be conquered through love: this is an eternal law."" We don't actually need a metaphysical self to blame in order to fix our problems. In fact the more I come to understand why people act the way they do and what they've been through, the more my resentment transforms into compassion. ""I never met a man I didn't like, just a man I didn't understand.""

We each just find ourselves existing under certain circumstances without having ever asked to, and for no obvious greater reason: there's something deeply unfair and absurd about this. And at the same time, it's this awareness of our mutually painful condition that a deeper and more endurable form of love for all things becomes possible. Suffering must be turned into both the lens through which it becomes possible to see yourself in everything, and the fuel necessary to motivate an ethical life (Love). But then, this sounds rather similar to comments Dan has made in the past: that the key to happiness is to ""find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it""; that is, to transcend the crude self in exchange for something far superior: to be, as he puts it ""ben-selfish"". Nirvana, Eudamonia, Moksha and so forth refer to the highest peaks of moral competence: the masters of extracting joy from the miserable and mundane, and transforming useless suffering into more endurable sorts of love and connection: the good life.

So, we have the terms ""agent"", ""agency"", ""self"", and ""control"", and they seem to be taking on different meanings in different contexts. I really do believe there's something ""spiritual"" or meta-ethical underlying this discussion. Freedom and flourishing isn't about some unfathomable truncation of the laws of physics, it's about understanding what determines us to feel and act the way we do, and thus enabling us to make the necessary corrections. We didn't ""choose"" to be response-able, but we are response-able, so let's act wisely.",0,1579144197,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/epdb59/sam_harris_daniel_dennett_buddhism_and_free_will/,philosophy,1

eolv6t,Hejenkaphle,The concept of GOD.,"Well in all logic- GOD is a powerful concept to guide us to the morally correct path driven by fear rather than ethics. It is somewhat a clever way of correcting our evil conscience but, not in all honesty as there are somethings that we do not truely understand. However, the concept of god has also always been manipulated and used as a tool by cunning savages to justify their evil doings by spreading false messages, claiming it to be gods desire (this refers to the injust acts in the name of god).There are many who hurt others and preach to god for forgiveness in every religion. But, we should be enlighted enough to understand that, every LIFE IS A GIFT no matter humans or animals, so called 'created by gods' if you will and every life has a heart full of emotions. And, we as a social beings have evolved an emotional understanding to live in harmony and cohesion, while being able to ethically judge whats good and whats evil as to, will it HELP others or HURT others. And for the sake of all of US, stay honest to your ethics &amp; heart, help others and try to never hurt anyone. If you do happen to hurt others even though not intented, do not just ask for forgiveness to god, rather to the people you have affected and try to make AMENDS which is more important. Good deeds spreads too not just evil, make this WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR EVERYONE not just yourself.

eol90l,godsknowledge,How do we interpret the 60% prediction accuracy of Libets experiment?,"The activity of prefrontal and parietal cortex was correlated with the decision (to use the left or right hand) with 60% prediction accuracy, up to 10 sec before the conscious decision. But to reflect a neural decision, the correlation would need to be at 100%, not 60%.

It makes no sense to say that Libets Experiment disproves Free Will because the accuracy is not 100% or am I misunderstanding something?

60% is more than 50%, but not that significant. If it was 100%, then we'd be sure that we don't have Free Will, but since it wasn't, we should believe in Free Will, since it hasn't been disproven scientifically. One could argue with determinism, but there are too many factors that need to be accounted, meaning that this theory can't be proven either.",0,1579008433,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eol90l/how_do_we_interpret_the_60_prediction_accuracy_of/,philosophy,1

eo9o6v,IllEstablishment5,Lets use our minds!,"I have no hope left. Every day that goes by it seems everything gets worse. From the political issues our world leaders engage in, to the unstoppable natural and man made disasters we humans and the animal kingdom must try to survive through; its too much. I feel like we no longer have a bright future to look forward to but one where we will have to work harder than usual just to get by. It saddens me to witness every day im alive in the wold, in the streets, in social media; what society has established as norms. Disrespect has become something of every day yet RESPECT has become a rare unicorn in the midst of all these tensions.  Society has tried to sexualize many of the things we and our children watch, from movies, TV, to even your average billbord you see while we drive to run your daily errands. It’s disgusting how we try to normalize all these things that if our grandparents were to witness they would be in shock. We have shifted to an era where we are all glued to phones , depend on technology to an extent many of us WOULDNT EVEN SURVIVE without it. We now live in a society where every one cares more about being liked than things that matter and doing the right moral thing there is no integrity left. Our country, the great United States of America has become divided due to political issues yet we all claim to be the America we were once 200+ years ago but the truth is our founding fathers would be disappointed and embarrassed of what we’ve become. One can only hope things will get better because the reality is, we only have a voice and if that voice goes against the majority, it is shut, but even then hope isn’t worth much today when the majority takes it all away! Where did we go wrong? What happened to the simple life we had back then? I completely understand life progresses and evolves but are we sure this is the path our ancestors had in mind? Will we ever get out of this hole we as humans are digging? Technology has been a blessing and a curse on this earth. We had hopes is would fix all of our problems and make life easier AND IT HAS but we as humans have failed, we have let it control the most important aspects of our lives such as our feelings and knowledge. Why is that so? Why do i say feelings and knowledge are the most important aspects of our lives? Because they are the ones the guide and aid us in the decisions we take in our every day life. Why have we become dependent on all that? Likes, followers, attention? If you stop and really think about it..... ITS ABSURD how much these things mean! How these things are determining the status of a person! How these things are defining the integrity of someone! What happened to ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. Nobody notices anything anymore. We all just SEE but never really UNDERSTAND whats happening in this world . Many of you reading this may agree with me but do you agree with me enough to do something about it or do you simply understand me enough to agree with me? Im not trying to change people im not trying to start a movement, heck im not even trying to get attention, what i simply from the bottom of my heart want is for people to THINK FOR THEMSELVES. Use REASON! Our minds are capeable of GREAT things! Stop letting social media, your frinds, your teachers, heck even your parents determine what and who you are! Spend time by yourself, look deep inside your mind, FIND YOURSELF. YOUR TRUE SELF not the one you think society should be, dont try to be the doctor or engineer or soldier your grandparents, parents, TV, friends are pushing you to be. Life is NOT  a race. Find your TRUE PASSION and exponentiate on that! You will see how life starts taking shape! You will love this life. You will cheerish every hour from that moment forth, because YOU are YOU. Theres no better comfort than thay of being comfortable with yourself and when you let influence drive your life you will NEVER be yourself. Fight yourself, you are your gratest enemy. Challenge yourself because YOU are your only obstacle in life! We CAN truly achieve whatever we set our mind to (of 
course within the boundries and physical laws of this beautiful universe) but you get my point! OUR MIND is our most powerful tool! Lets start using it!",1,1578946896,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eo9o6v/lets_use_our_minds/,philosophy,1

eo88mg,Psyschonautis101,"My thoughts on Music (Music is information, information is Life","I've always had a strong sense of connection to music, to the point that I feel ""*plugged in*"" whilst listening to it and have always marveled on its tendency to transform an awkward or tedious situation at the very least into a tolerable one  Music, along with forms of visual art is an extremely potent stimulant, which is able to produce a host of differing impressions &amp; reactions on our mind and consciousness, i.e. as recognized in the popular expression *""A picture is worth a 1000 words""*.  To dispel any potential doubt, any debate of either music or the visual arts being ""*stronger*"" than its counterpart does not hold much merit, as each individual is different and they stimulate different senses. However, as I personally find music to be more engaging of the two I'm going to focus solely on it.  To that end, I believe the following paragraphs apply in full measure to the visual arts as well, as both they and music appeal to and are directly experienced through our organs, which distinguishes them from other works of art i.e. literature.  I've tried to present my take on why music produces such a powerful impression on our consciousness and of course am open to any discussion on the topic.

In my view music is reminiscent of a robust form of telepathy - when two or more individuals listen to a song they really like, it impacts each one differently, but afterwards share an appreciation of the experience (presumably having gone through similar emotions, which of course is entirely subjective, but nevertheless a sense of bonding does often occur), even though is next to impossible to put it into words. Naturally, this holds true, no matter what the impact of the given piece of music is and whether it produces a positive reaction or not, but the takeaway is that it elicits an instantaneous, primal reaction. Furthermore, almost every individual can derive pleasure from listening to music, to the point that the inability to do so is classified as a type of neurological disorder called musical anhedonia ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical\_anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_anhedonia)). When music is played and heard our minds instantly process that cognitive input and produce some sort of intuitive emotional reaction, which is only amplified when the experience is shared. Consequently, music seems to be fundamentally tied to our existence and experience, as its established that musical instruments (along with forms of visual art) have been central to our lives since the dawn of civilization.

Here is my hypothesis: 

First of all, these substances induce strong feelings of empathy, presence and interdependence of all things. There are many schools of thought, traditions and individuals that are based on this and/or have introduced their own ideas, but I'll avoid adhering to a single one here, in order to keep the focus on the subject at hand. For the sake of argument, let's just say the basic and fundamental situation of life is optimal and suffering is something that stems from our own delusions and confused mind (this is my personal view). 

If we take this line of reasoning further, then the fundamental nature of reality can be expressed through two opposing states - life and death; existence vs. non-existence. Something can either exist (even though it may in an ""imperfect) form or does not exist at all and then there is just a void, a nothing. With that in mind, add the  consideration that all existing things are essentially one and the same, but with different forms and shapes, that there is no fundamental difference between ""*this*"" and ""*that*"" and rather than a universe filled with separate, *hard* objects and life forms, with their own creation and destruction (or birth and death), everything is in truth one continuous ever-flowing process, that has been going since that beginning of time and will continue until its very end, the reason behind the impact becomes more apparent.

I alluded to music as a form of telepathy, because it is a way of non-verbal communication between people. In the most common instance, the musician performs something and both he and the audience experience joy. So, bearing in mind the aforementioned view on the universe and the nature of music, the essence of the matter is this – **Music is information, information is life and life is joy, because existence is the only alternative to non-existence**. Music is a subtle way of manipulation of the material world, where it can instantly produce new information or viewed differently - **create new information, life**.  If something exists, it is by definition not void and therefore it represents the full breadth of life, because it is antagonistic to nothingness. Experiencing information means we are alive and to that extend music makes us happy, **because it is basically a celebration of life** – something is created and we are given the opportunity to experience it, as opposed to a void where no-thing, nor anyone can exist. This intrinsic realization is hardwired to our fundamental nature and though we are not conscious of it, it nevertheless has a profound impact on us. 

**Music is information and information is life.**

If you’ve managed to stay so far – thank you. Some parts may seem self-evident, obvious and/or repetitive, but I tried to lay out my idea as clearly as possible. Of course, this view point is entirely subjective and does not focus on any neurological and biological aspects of the matter (of which I know nothing about), but it seems to align well with the aforementioned world view.

enur85,magiao47,Truth is a lie,"One of the main purposes of the human, other than find happiness is to find truth, but what is truth? If we knew for sure that God existed, being God a superior identity able to hold all actual absolute truth, then truth could be confirmed by this identity, but the ""truth"" is that we are the most intelligent species we know, so there is absolutely no outter confirmation except from someone like you, like me and like us. And people like us are just that: people with opinions, so no matter how many people have the same opinion, how can you be sure that there isn't someone else with the opposite opinion who actually holds the truth and how could this person know she's holding the truth. We are all just little life forms communicating with each other trying to get a sense of logic from this illogical world we live in by sharing thoughts and shaping opinions called truths that are really always changing. Who knows maybe I am completely wrong by saying this, but are you right? Is good and evil even a thing?

enqxjr,Cummonism,Is Libertarianism a circular teleological position which replaces God with 'the Market'?,"Something I have been ruminating about the past few days. I think libertarianism is not any sort of legitimate political philosophy, but it's a circular teleological position which replaces God with 'the Market.' When a Libertarian proposes that ""The Market"" will solve a problem, they don't actually mean that it has a solution - they just find a normative point and declare it a solution. Why is it a solution? Because it's what the Market produced. The most curious aspect of the Libertarian religion is their projection of religiosity onto everyone else. From Social Liberals, real Classical Liberals, Socialists, Conservatives, etc. they're all unified by the 'religion of stateism.' As is to be expected of Libertarians, Conservatives, Evangelicals, Fascists and others, they have no conception of ways of thinking different than their own. The far-rightist will unironically insist that opposing racism is equal to hating whites, because they cannot imagine people living without racial hatred. Evangelicals and cultural conservatives cannot tolerate the existence of cultural threads incompatible with theirs, because they can only imagine that everyone else wishes the same destruction upon them as they do upon others. Libertarians are much the same. Failing to agree with Libertarian theology is not a rejection of it as shallow, superficial, and a lazy, inadequate means to understand the world that's mostly tailored to arrogant teenagers. No, everyone in the world except Libertarians merely holds The State as a rival God to their own God, The Market. They adhere to Stateism not because Libertarian theology is inadequate, but because they ascribe The State even greater powers than the Market. Given: Libertarianism rejects large portions of Liberal thought and bears the closest resemblance to feudalism or early oligarchic republics. Not so different from fascism in that respect.

**Contrariwise**, some have said that I have made a prejudicial evaluation of libertarianism, since that I failed to provide a modicum of evidence or grounding for the gratuitous claims, and, readily swift to assert that the political philosophy is not ""legitimate"", guilty of ""circular"" reasoning and the ""projection of religiosity onto \[sic\] everyone else"", ""shallow, superficial,... lazy"". I have been called dogmatic and myopic in my judgment, and approximating my impassioned criticism of libertarianism as a religious ideology. Do you guys think my position is a ""normative point"", a ""teleological position""? The myriad of published works on the efficiency and optimisation of the market and its corollaries (eg., prices) aside, do you agree with the content I wrote in the first paragraph, or, the critique herein? I am curious.",1,1578852627,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/enqxjr/is_libertarianism_a_circular_teleological/,philosophy,1

 MORALS 

  


so the problem being addressed here is whether morals acctualy have any benefit of being socially accepted to the people which strive to make them soccially accptable, and wether if there is any harm to the people who strive otherwise, and the word (morals) here is deffiened as a set of actions that are not harmfull for the people and also beneficial, so Let us first assume that subject1 has accepted that hurting others for his/her own benifit is somthing that should be seen as socially acceptable(therefore making him/her one which strives for morals to be socially unacceptable). then subject2 who belives in the same thing, which of course would be someone doing somthing which is from the prespective of subject1 as socially acceptable, would be justified in hurting subject1 for his/her own benifit; therefore if subject1 strives to make morals socially unacceptable (s)he will be striving to harm (him/her)self, but now if subject1 strives to make morals socially acceptable (s)he would be alleviating the harm done to her/him. this thesis gives a clear and solid reassoning as why there is not only a benefit, but a benefit and alleviation of harm to the people who strive to make them socially acceptable",1,1578850458,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/enqf5a/morals/,philosophy,1

enjcxs,semiadult420,my thoughts about philosophical things,"MY TOUGHTS ON PHILOSOPHICAL THINGS

 TRUTH

  


Let us start by evaluating why is truth is desireable. of course

anything that is desirable must be beneficial, so a truth that is desireable must be benificial meaning that a truth that will quench our desires for it must be benefical, but first how can a truth be beneficial, well a truth can turn into benefit through application, as there is no other way a non-physical thing can have a physical affect, so a truth that we are desireing is not always the absloute truth but it is always a beneficial

(therefore applicable) truth.

 MORALS 

  


Let us first assume that subject1 has accepted that hurting others for his/her own benifit is true. then subject2 who belives in the same thing, which of course would be someone doing somthing which is true from the prespective of subject1, would be justified in hurting subject1 for his/her own benifit; therefore if subject1 belives in the hurting of others he also belives in hurting him(her)self, but now if subject1 is opposed to the hurting of others he will also be opposed to the hurting of her(him)self, since (s)he would be opposed and stop subject2 from hurting him/her. so morals must exsist as an agreement bettwen potintial harmers(as long as you dont hurt me i will not hurt you) and also the same argument could be said for the fact that he should accept the benefiting of others if he/she also wants to be benefited, so treat others as you want to be treated yourself because other have the abilty to treat you as badly or as goodly as you do to them.

 PURPOSE IN LIFE 

  


  


  


The fact that life has no intrinsic meaning, or value is very freeing and librating ,as now anyone can make there own meaning and purpose, so it is not that life has no purpose or meaning it is that everyone has there own special purpose and or meaning.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  


  


 SUICIDE 

  


  


Sucide is not the option as the only reasson for its existence is not knowing if happiness will prisist to ocour, but of course happiness could always be experinced by breaking bad routines ,as happiness is the unexpected with possitive implications to oneslef, and saddness is the unexpected with negative implications to oneself, and so by expecting the worst one is not just steping away from saddness, but going towards happiness

  


  


  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  


  


 PHILOSOPHY OF EMOTION

  


  


All emotions come from the unexpected, and there divisrstiy comes from implications of the unexpected, as saddness is the unexpected with negative implication to oneself, fear is the unexpected with implication that onself is going to get hurt, laughter is the unexpected with no implications, and happiness is the unexpected with possitive implications to oneself so on and so fourth, also the intensety of an emotion comes from the intenstiy of the unexpected, as somthing that is very unexpected would be more noticalbe than otherwise so, its implications are more noticable, and so the emotion conected to that certine implication would also be more intense than otherwise. side note: it can also be derived from these ideas that everyone benfits the same from life no matter how fourtunate or unfourtunate.

en6mei,archeriff,The irritating Kantian purity,"I had to deal with Kant through different works of his for more than 4 years in university now. I really like how an argument, a really simple argument (i.e. his distinction between *a priori* and *a posteriori*), can lead to so many different and mindblowing conclusions in every area of the known at that time philosophical problematic and also to reveal a new path for much more to come. 

Every time I had to pick one of Kant's work for the first time, however, I'm almost entirely sure where it would start and how it would develop. Am I the only one who got really irritated by this obsessive claims for formal naturalization of almost everything, of this aprioristic method that simplifies everything? I mean... Kant was critiqued for this fundamental premise of his philosophy no earlier then Hegel's first appearance on the stage of German philosophy. My question is more like - why the f\*\*\* are there so many Kantians still here today?! It's not just that liberalism goes hand in hand with the idea of ""pure"" conceptuality, accessible to any rational being, the absurdism of ""the veil of ignorance"" and stuff like that. I feel that it has to do mostly with his moral philosophy, but I can't really define why, since the categorical imperative - understood as an empty and formal law which had to be filled with the specificity of the situation, the context and so on, is nothing more than common sense.

en5440,My-third-eye-stinks,Is anything concrete?,"I was thinking about the nature of reality (not that I know too much about the nature of reality but I do like to ponder it) and I came to the conclusion that nothing is concrete and everything is fluid. Even this sentence could be meaningless without the proper subject to decipher its meaning. And I am starting to realize that's how life is. Nothing is concrete no idea is tangible. Everything is potential. Our minds entrap us into certain beliefs or ideas in order to ensure the survival of our species. With enough exposure and brainwashing one could pluck a person from society and warp their mind so they don't believe anything they've ever been taught including their name. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything we believe is merely a construct, often times we go to the math's and sciences for a more concrete understanding but even these are just constructs. Now hear me out I don't mean to say that science and math aren't real. Medicine is a true testament to their powers. But that they only exist in so far as we do. I guess what I am trying to say is that we live in a field of potential. Sort of like an energy field that is somehow rearranging itself to create certain patterns or what we perceive as patterns. What if these patterns manifest themselves across multiple dimensions and we are only one type of perceiving creature in one dimension perceiving the same energy as another perceiving creature in a different dimension yet we perceive two totally different realities? 

&amp;#x200B;

Does this make sense? Does anyone else feel this way? I almost feel no one is right in understanding anything because anything can be everything. Our human mind limits our potential. Can we transcend our humanity and become higher beings? I am looking for truly open minded responses. For too long I have been the guy who said nothing matters, there's no point to life, but I believe there's no point to a materialistic life. We live in an infinite field of energy which is constantly flowing, changing, and evolving. If only we could begin to tap into the source and connect to this energy. Conventionally speaking it seems as though we only use .001% of this energy potential(or a really small percentage). What if it were possible to create dimensions in space or create space itself? What if physical matter (including non observable matter) only make up a small portion of the universe? What if our ""Big Bang"" was actually an experiment to see if space could be created? How could there be laws to the universe? Stability, order, diversity, life it seems simple but there has to be some kind of intelligence behind it. Even if it is that infinite energy is in fact intelligent. Perhaps we humans merely possess a sophisticated awareness that is too specialized to understand that energy is intelligent in the same we humans thought animals lack real awareness.

emwjv9,CarnonosSeeker,Consciousness as a gift,"Consciousness is the greatest and absurd pain in human’s life. Omit time, absorb events happening around you and feel the presence of you, “the reality”, ego. Feeling the presence of the paradox of every single moment in your existence is the most unbearable feeling which human can experience.

Realizing the paradox I exist, there is “I”, somewhere. Whoever/whatever it is, it knows, that this reality is not real, it shouldn’t exist … and yet here I am, casted into the world without an objective to reach. Let it sink. Introspect. One must ineluctably conclude pleasure is the goal, right? Why would you want to hurt yourself? Once you achieve pleasure, a pain is required to fortify your reality. Painless life is vanity. Neither pleasure nor pain is the answer. 

Is a power the objective?  To shape world around you as you desire? Our desires are naturally driving us to the power. Without power, you will remain unfulfilled. Get confronted, get beaten, stand and fight once more. But why? What sense does it make to fight in the middle of nothingness for nothing? Nihil … Nihil … Nihil … mantra of our existence lurking in the shadows. Altering fabricated reality unable to escape from its strings. The reality’s claws tickling your senses to pretend it has a purpose for its existence. Ethereal recurrence!  Everything happens only in your head. Do not let the abyss to surround you. 

As absurd as it may sound, making others life tomorrow better than today is, that is the goal. Protect life, help it flourish and you will be rewarded. Consciousness will not be pain anymore. Do not fear misfortune, when it comes, embrace it. Don't hesitate to use everything within you. Pleasure, pain, power you possess, anticipate, use your emotions, love, joy, anger, burn your enemies in paroxysm of rage, forgive them, help them to raise once more. Make tomorrow better than today is. See tomorrow better than today is. The change for better tomorrow must commence with you.

This topic has been something I’ve always been quite curious about. I’m a history student with a keen interest in philosophy and psychology. I’ve also been smoking cannabis both regularly and leisurely for the past 3-4 years (just turned 22), and often I find my abillity to percieve and understand ideas and concepts when high. I always write down my thoughts and look over them the next day, and often I find consistent clarity within my thoughts. My only real question here is if any of you find a similar enhancement of your thoughts and ideas with cannabis or other psychoactive substances. Also, do any of you have any knowledge of past thinkers in history who’ve experimented with any substances and found similar results. Only Huxley really comes to mind.

elqvud,AcolyteProd,Call for a global project: we do not want war.,"\[Hi all, need to explain why i'm posting right here right now a little bit before you dig into this project: posting on reddit became a battle, this post has been rejected on the ""art"" sub. I mean, where can I post these things then? Other subs I searched were only giving the possibility to post links, or images, but no text. So I'm tired of searching for a ""good"" sub, I mean with a subject which fits with my project. So I'm here. And I feel like I must say ""I'm sorry"" which is a shame. Anyway. I need to reach a lot of people as you'll understand. So censorship is really killing me, you'll get why by reading me in a few seconds. So please, dear mods, please, really, let this be alive please. I need to find people, to be connected to them and make them participate in this global project of mine. I NEED this. So please help me. Don't make me think I'd rather go shoot myself because there's no space for freedom anymore, only careless rules. DAMN &lt;3 I need to reach as much people as I can, Reddit should be the place...please help.\]

Hi dear people I'm Alex from France. I'm trying to reach as much people as I can all around the world in order to participate in a project I NEED (more than I want) to do right now:

I need you, no matter the country you live in, no matter your color, religion, community, to record a 5 seconds video clip of yourself, in selfie mode, saying ""We do not want war"". Then send the file to [wedonotwantwarproject@gmail.com](mailto:wedonotwantwarproject@gmail.com)

PLEASE, don't go in the comment section to explain me why it's naive, dumb, useless, blablablabla. I NEED to act, to do something. I NEED IT. So the last thing I need is negative people or reactions. Feel free to think what you want, it's your right and I love it. BUT, there's no need for comments here, if it's not to participate. If you think it's dumb, have a nice day dear friends. And let me have a nice day. My goal will be to create a video edit of a tons of these clips, showing diversity and ONE wish for all which is peace. Clearly the news these days are pushing me into survival mode, despair is way too strong, everywhere, everything sounds like it's fucked forever. And I spent years chatting with people from all around the world during years, and we all agree on the fact that we wait for the wake up call. I CAN'T WAIT FOR A WAKE UP CALL. WE MUST CREATE IT RIGHT NOW.

We MUST SHOW who we are, brothers.

Of course we did things like this years before, 2003-2004 etc. But we were not equipped with social networks and video tools we now have directly into our smartphones. Now we can all create a film together, being in the same project, participating from everywhere, and creating unity in one final object which must serve as a proof of our brotherhood, to fight division, which is why we slowly die or kill hope inside ourselves. And you just need to take 5 seconds to say 5 words.

So, if you're ok to help me, please feel free to do so. I'd be so glad to make ONE object from diversity and against division/war. But I need soooooooo many participants. So I'd be glad if you could share this idea and project too, the email adress and the 5 words, and ask your friends to participate ; especially if you have contacts in foreign countries. Try to reach them and involve them, I NEED to create one object from everywhere, to show, prove, illustrate how many we are, brothers, tired of waiting for peace and consideration, hope and relief.

I won't spend another 10 years watching the news while shitting on myself cause the world looks ugly. I NEED to do something. And I want it to be beautiful. :)

Have a nice day brothers &amp; sisters. Hehehe.

elp0ol,TheEmployedMoth,Beyond Learning,"When we only learn what can already be learned, we never go beyond the learning, we never exceed the point of known knowledge. Everyone reaches the same point in the learning, and we become like everyone else, limited by what is available to learn. It is similar to creating. If we only create within the boundaries of a style or act within the norms of a society, we never create anything new. This is the limiting factor with learning and why schools are often criticized for the quality of students that they produce. When we put boundaries on learning, or on creating, we limit how far we can explore, and how far we can push culture. Often, our learning or creating is limited by what is acceptable by a certain standard. Some societies forbid the learning, or even exposure, of particular information. They also limit the areas that creativity can go by censoring content. We also get caught in stylistic dogmas of how to do things and prescribe them with a heightened sense of importance and reverence. When anything new is introduced into a system, that is from outside the norm, it's considered to be chaotic to the order of things, or, chaotic to the power that benefits from that order.

When you can go beyond the learned and the known, then, and only then, can you truly learn or create. Otherwise, you are just learning or creating what already exists. Our systems, structures, and habits are there for a reason, to develop a correct way of doing things – they simulate efficiency, which must be respected in a foundational sense. We cannot imagine a world without order. We've tried in narratives, but these narratives still have recognizable points of focus. Pure chaos is completely unknown; it cannot be conceived. Even nature has developed simplistic orders for the survival of its cause. But this is not to say that we stay within the confines of what we know – people need to push the boundaries into the unknown. They must push culture to its limits, and beyond. Only then will learning happen: learning how far we can go, and subsequently, what we can create. If everyone did this, learned from the past, but then devoted themselves to going beyond the known, the world would have fewer problems. There would be no wars because we would have learned that war is wrong, and we would have gone beyond the learned into something new, a solution to conflict and violence. We would learn that political sabotage, narcissism, and greed are wrong, just to name a few. Perhaps, then, it is biological why we continue to be wrong in this sense - which is another conversation on drives, emotions, pleasure, impulses.

Find your path and practice quieting the mind, and the answer will come. The subconscious has stored all your experiences in the long-term memory and does not let you access most of this information consciously. It's the soup to which you've added a lifetime worth of ingredients. Think of the conscious mind as the systems and structures to navigate this world – the concrete. And, think of the subconscious mind as the unrestricted possibilities of creation, as well as the irrationality of emotion – the abstract. The subconscious never says 'no,' as we would all know from our dreams. Let it speak to you and offer you its wisdom, and once it has spoken, use your conscious mind to make adjustments where necessary. To do this, we must quiet the conscious mind, and the subconscious will come through with ideas. There are many ways to do so: personally, I like to pace my house, workout, and recently, driving has been my go-to. Once the conscious mind is occupied with a menial, boring task, the subconscious can start to emerge. This will take time, and some people may not have a direction for their thoughts to flow, but it will eventually give you answers. I can direct my attention to ideas and writing, but in the beginning, I didn't have writing, and through introspection, I came to the conclusion that I need to write all these ideas down. This could be a similar occurrence for most people, where they come to the conclusion that they need an outlet, or want to pursue a passion they've always wanted to before the subject-specific ideas flow. Then, once you find your path, you start to double-down on your intention within that discipline. This act transforms you from the old to the new and is the start of potentially creating something new in the world, not just in your life. Only then, when you start quieting the mind, you start to learn, create, and go beyond what existed before. The learned is the old, and it is necessary, but to be truly creative, you must venture into the new.

ekzxus,abcstatistics,Outline or philosophy or ethics (graph),"For the last year I've read few introductory philosophy and ethics books. I've seen literary hundreds of terms (for example: absolutism, cynicism, empiricism ...) and a lot of them are an extension, or rather, have a ""parent"" term. Example:

Utilitarianism:

* Act and rule utilitarianism
* Two-level utilitarianism
* Preference utilitarianism

I've googled it for half an hour and I cannot find some ""outline"" of terms in a graph I've attached to this post. Either for philosophy in general, or ethics will do!

Reason why I'm searching for it is that I think I will better understand them if I can clearly see derivatives and opposing ideas.

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

In philosophy, the question is sometimes to know if one is a dilettante, an amateur or a *connoisseur* \- if there are indeed *connoisseurs,* outside the culture of the environment (study / course of philosophy).

Besides, should we not today consider philosophy scientifically, through what we would call *philosophy studies* (not to be confused, therefore, with the *studies / course of philosophy*). *Philosophy studies,* a bit like there are *gender, post-colonial* or *science studies*! What does u/Herclinze do, if not such lacanist *philosophy studies*? ...

Which does not at all mean that we should give up philosophizing, I just doubt that it is wise to philosophize without such a boost in *philosophy studies,* at least in a corner of the mind. Or ?

To put it with an image: it is contemporary *""Malin Génie"",* unless this *Malin Génie* also asks to be questioned! ... The answer is obviously yes, for the philosopher, isn't it?

Anyway, that's what I suggested to u/PM_MOI_TA_PHILO, about Luc Ferry and his academics philosophy, [in his topic on some reading projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophie/comments/eizk75/les_courants_philosophiques_guide_liste/fcvdiq7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), on the r/philosophie.

Societal benefits: Our findings principally consider economic factors and social, then effectually analyse determinations of what benefits potential and substantial exclusions regarding risks to the predominant rule.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***« Eviter de créer et de renforcer des biais injustes. »*** Actuellement, de nombreux systèmes d’IA, fondés sur des données humaines, [tendent à reproduire les préjugés racistes, sexistes ou autres de leurs modèles](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2017/04/15/quand-l-intelligence-artificielle-reproduit-le-sexisme-et-le-racisme-des-humains_5111646_4408996.html).

Evidence of belief must not reinforce injustice: In reality, the names of artificial intelligence systems are in the domain of humans, and tend to reproduce racism (white supremacy), sexism (patriarchy), and other concerned issues.

Incorporating the principles of respecting private life: a certain number of technologies of artificial intelligence are necessary, for the functioning of the mass civilians, and solving concerned questions of respect for most people.

* ***« Se maintenir aux hauts standards de l’excellence scientifique. »*** Dans les méthodes de recherche et de développement, mais aussi en publiant les résultats de ses travaux scientifiques, précise Google.

eiafxd,Diogonni,Socrates in Surfing with Sartre. The debate over the good life.,"Socrates says that the good life is examining your life and values, working on your knowledge and wisdom as well as improving other virtues. In the Surfing with Sartre book, philosopher Aaron James says that Socrates is exaggerating and that no one would choose a short and pensive life of learning over a nice and long life of enjoyable surfing. What do you guys think of that statement; do you agree? Do you think that’s a fair comparison?

Personally, I think that dichotomy was not what Socrates was all about. He did not tell people to shut themselves up in a room and read books all day and spend all their time philosophizing. In The Republic, Socrates mentions going to a festival full of entertainment and fun. In other works he talked about enjoying drinking. Socrates also had a family, so that line in the book which paints him as a boorish academic is just not true. Philosophy was his passion and while he practiced it more than most people did in his day, he was not arguing for people to spend all their time philosophizing. He wanted them to spend some of their time in examination. 

Socrates also mentioned how people care way too much about money, power and fame. He mentioned that during his trial, and ironically, we can see a lot of those same ideas being passed around today. That’s one of the popular modern day philosophies. So then, I do think that Socrates had a good point. People should examine their beliefs and see if they are truly as good as they say they are. How can power be good in and of itself; aren’t there both people who abuse their power and those who use it righteously? Then perhaps power in and of itself is not a virtue.


The idea that someone can just surf their whole life and live a good life has possibility, however it is flawed. There’s going to be good people who surf and not so nice people, just like in any area of life. Surfing can definitely teach someone positive lessons on how to enjoy life, but I disagree that it leads to the good life, it’s just one component. The only way to get any closer to the good life and to rise above the random chance of being a good person from a decent family, or not, is to work on your virtues and knowledge like Socrates said. Because how could an amateur captain sail across the ocean? If he made it across it would be partially luck and partly his meager skills. The best chances would lie in a well seasoned captain.

That is not to disparage the surfers, though, because many of them do have knowledge on how to live a good life. We all get taught at various points in our life on how to be a good person, such as from our parents. So we have the capabilities to live the good life. However, there are more and more pitfalls in society and the media nowadays that can lead people astray. Plenty of politicians could be fooling us. Is surfing going to help educate us to better see through the smoke and mirrors for the betterment of society? Clearly not, so surfing alone can’t lead to the good life.",1,1577834106,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eiafxd/socrates_in_surfing_with_sartre_the_debate_over/,philosophy,1

ei8x3f,Megayeetotron,Nothing we ever did was our responsibility,"A certain theory popped in my head and I would like to share it.

It can't be denied that are our personality is formed largely due to our surroundings. Some follow the same ethics and lessons that they were taught when they were children, others change through the influence of others in their life.

A person might become a criminal due to repressed childhood trauma, for example. All of our actions are a results of the lessons we learned from our past, and the things we experienced.

The theory is as follows: nothing we did was ever our choice.

Positive aspects of a person such femenism, compassion, environmentalism, etc... as well negative aspects such as racism and homophobia, are all acquired from other people, be it through family, friends, school, social media, etc...

In a sense, every action you take is completely under the control of how others contributed to shaping you.

But that doesn't mean that people that are considered bad people are at fault.

They were also influenced and forged by their environment; the environment created by those before them. I'm not talking about our great great grandparents, but rather, the first humans to exist in a society.

Which would lead us to believe, the original ancestors were split into two: the good and the bad.

The 'good' influenced the 'bad', and vice versa, thus creating new people with their own personalities and actions.

In a sense, it would be fair to say, all the corruption and evil in the current world is not the fault of the transgressors, but rather, the first humans.

The same applies for the good actions. We do good actions because we were programmed to do so. 

Conclusion: Nothing was ever our choice

ehsl3n,vetalyhayden,The Problem With Life,"There is no meaning to life: philosophically or biologically, we as a species (or any other) can never function to serve any type of purpose to satisfy our need for self elucidation, since life is inevitably pointless for the reason that all species prove to have no impact on the fundamental construct of the universe, regardless of how advanced their society, capabilities, and power are. In other words they can not change the fact that despite how they live or what they do an accomplish, states of matter will always be transferred into another form; as inhabitants of planets die, ecosystems are changed, and new forms of using and transferring energy are discovered. 

Even as the most technologically, intellectually, and insightfully developed species known to exist, we will never exceed the finality of what all living things must do, and that is: die. We might posses the medical capacity to pioneer transdifferentiation among cells, {in a attempt to create immortality} but we will never have the ability to stop mutations, external death, and natural selection, nor would the colonization of outer space be a feasible solution to counter this. 

Confused? 

The point of what I’ve told you is to show you that we cannot avoid the certainty of death no matter what medical or technological progress we make, or how much territory and space we expand into: natural selection, mutations, and external death will always occur leaving us to die. 

Since all living things must die, there will one day cease to be life forms to process the experiences, knowledge, and history of all that once was. This information will then be worthless rendering all things viewed as “important” or “significant” by higher level species invaluable just as they started. 

To what purpose we serve: none
To what impact we have: none 
To what we can do about it to change it: nothing 

Death is a unavoidable end we all face. Nothing we do will change it. And Nothing we do in life matters. So now we wonder “why continue”? Why don’t we all end ourselves if it all doesn’t matter? If what you feel about yourself and others isn’t important , and what you do isn’t significant, then why bother? As they say: “it won’t matter in a 100 years because we’ll all be dead”. You missing your loved one won’t matter, you fighting with your friends won’t matter, you passing your test won’t matter. Getting good grades, being smart, being good at sports or a hobby, none of it matters in the end: so then why does it matter to us and why can’t we accept this truth and continue living?

ehlizx,yitzilitt,On the meaning of “true” and “false”,"What is true, and what is false? Most people, when asked this question, think the answer is obvious. What is real is what is true is what exists, and what is not real is what is false is what does not exist. But this is not quite accurate. Take for example the statement “one plus one equals two.” This is obviously true. But is the statement in any meaningful sense real? After all, there is nothing in nature one can point at and say “this is one” or “this is two” or “this is equality”—all of those are abstract concepts which can be applied to aspects of the observable world, but cannot themselves be tangibly found within it. The statement “all numbers are divisible by one” is clearly true, but there is nothing in this world you can point at and say “this is a number.” What then does it mean for anything to be called true or false? I do not know, at the end of the day, what the actual answer is. But I can offer a working definition that I find practically useful, and is the closest I have yet seen to what we mean when we talk about truth or falsity: a statement is true when it is self-consistent, and is false when it is self-contradictory, which is when two or more identical logical constructs can be shown to give at least two mutually exclusive values using the same logical system. For example, the statement “Einstein had six legs” is false, assuming said statement is referring to the historical physicist Albert Einstein, because the “leg value” of Albert Einstein is known from historical documentation to be two, but is now also asserted to be six; a clearly mutually exclusive result, and therefore contradictory. I hypothesize that all provably contradictory statements can be shown to give at least two mutually exclusive results. By extension, all statements that don’t result in mutually exclusionary outcomes can be considered “true,” if not “real”. Perhaps this is obvious to others, or perhaps this is plainly incorrect. If anyone has any thoughts on this, I’d love to hear them.",1,1577709196,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ehlizx/on_the_meaning_of_true_and_false/,philosophy,1

ehl2hh,tai41,Thoughts on the correlation of psychological phenomenon and paranormal activity,"So I’m laying in bed, thinking about a girl I just kissed, becoming VP of my company and creating new ideas, while also exploring my life musically and pursuing an alternate career in music. I also recently made lifestyle changes in terms drug use. 

So I’m laying in bed, and I’m about to fall asleep. I live in a very old home with many (what could be) spirits roaming around the house. College city. With stories of ghosts before, I’ve never seen one except for when I was a kid. 

So I’m drifting to sleep, and I hear a voice in a clean, crisp and urgent voice say: “do it”

I had been writing about angels and demons and ups and downs in life, and the voice said: “do it” 

What was the voice from? What does it want? Any thoughts?",1,1577705991,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ehl2hh/thoughts_on_the_correlation_of_psychological/,philosophy,1

ehcixg,Renan4455,A discussion about what determines Left and Right in politics,"So, I was having this political discussion with an uncle of a friend of mine, where he said that what determines the political right is minimal state, and that the objective of EVERY SINGLE political left is the end of capitalism. I found both of those statements absolutely absurd, and pointed out the existence of social-democracy, as an example of a left that doesn't want the end of capitalism: he completely denied it's existence. I also pointed out, as examples of right wing regimes that weren't part of the minimal state mentality, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy: he claimed both nazism and fascism were left wing ideologies. Upon pointing out the obvious personal and ideological differences of these regimes when compared to any leftist ideology, he said those didn't matter, because in both regimes, the state controlled the economy, coming back to the ""every right winger is in favor of minimal state"" argument. I would like to hear your views in this, specially if you have any form of academic experience on the topic, and how I could answer those seemingly irreducible claims (not because of how valid they are, but because of the way they are made). Thank you, and sorry for the wall of text.

eha0cl,jamesvjr,#Blasphemy,"A forced mutation of civilization
Has left us blindly masqueraded in, 
a massive desiccation.
Elitists want segregation, 
To places emphasis on emptiness,
As opposed to complacentness,

Hallow as secata pupaes, 
after Metamorphic transformation,
Becoming a cruel cold world,
A form of horrific exhibits,
set displayed among the very masses that they have made dig the grave where they plan to bury us away,
Every last trace of the human race
Which was enslaved.

Now who had fucks to gave?
I understand it only half way,
Lost on the corner at a fork in the road,
6788 where the hell is my mind &amp;
Somewhere laying dead
behind the pine...

Tree that they chopped down,
Built a box,
To lay me down,
Out of sight,
Below ground,
In Hopes,
I'm never found.

For when I come back,
I'm hitting with the fury of hell
manifested in a hatchet that
Whacks,
Smacks and thuds,
Masked by the blackness, 
Bask in the madness,

on my hip sets
two Ratchets,
Upon my back,
This axe sets.
Blasphemous,
At Love and hates axis.
Aghast at this entire world,
We set the point
Of no return,
May you move forward in grace,
Or forever burn in disgraces flames.

Push on at such pace
avoids unnecessary Hardships,
Heart aches and body shakes,
Melted minds and spiritual binds,
And in case you forget the reason 
For which you travel this road,
Its because your spirt grows from
The bottom to the top,
a glow to full inferno. 
I shall bear no guilt for another
Expectations, 
False conceptions,
Quick conclusions or masked deception. 
From conception we are destined for
For the task of resurrection,
Of the self and only self,
Your achievements are the guiding light,
For those around you,
still lost in lifes fog,
Teaching clarity so they may make there way out and have sight,
darkness is sometimes less
Deceptive to the blinding splendor 
Of the false gods light.


How can one be any more rerardeder 
To label pity as a form of martyrdom?
Well if those stars are strung,
then that would make me 
An even dumber one,
To believe in only holy ghost ,
His father and they're son?
To believe in only one only limits you hidden potential to expand from you
Apparent truth in which you hold with 
Raw confidence, 
Scratch that, 
Raw arrogance, 
No better yet,
Raw relivence,
To a mind behind a blind instilled by
Energies of those who's souls who
Try to Confide mine,
There is absolutely no sleep
if lifes remains violent,
No peace till sleep ceases
And the world has grown silenced,
By blowing breezes between trees across
Seas,
Over mountain tops,
Where I will set.
Just some bitter day mares and
Night terrors I used to hide
Away from,
We all just wish to stay young, 
Yet we pay to play away every night and day with satan.
Lord give us strength to break ties,
Walk away from the lies,
Yes,
There is a prize to fall in line
For your own demise, 
Its call civility.
I will die free before I am granted 
Eternity in captivity, 
For there are fates much more torturous than death.
So I welcome all detest,
Till my last breath, 
I will be the bullseye for you
Projectiles and loose not a single
Bit of rest.

Whether telescopic 
gamma ray
Or infared,
The dead sees you,
And If they wish to,
The dead will seize you,
And leave you dust blowing through 
Eternity.
So my destination,
Dead sea on permanent vacation, 
As I cruise aboard a skidoo.
Hold all banter please.

I now speak to the dead, 
In multiple degrees. 
I beg of you,
use me
As your vessel for means,
To be between,
Worlds Of things seen
And worlds of what isnt,
with you as my guide towards
Infinity, 
I bring A cry so deafening, 
This Hatred that's so exsessive,
only emptiness and desolence
Will remain of the wicked world
We know as the presence,
Mine Soul soaked in kerosene
I eat the book of matches,
Kablam!
Transparency,
Blood and body of thy merciless 
God beyond thine pharisees.

I officially have flown over
The coo coo nest
I guess trying to
Appear restrained and maintained 
At this point is
only pointless.
So goodbye farewell and all that jazz
As I anoint my last breath with which
comes blessed salvation, 
Of All who did not sway when the devil
Spoke his minds,
For those who fell victim blind
to the devil lies,
All who's woes were overcame 
And who's temptations had met demise.
With that salvation comes a revelation 
Upon those wouldn't choose a side,
Impaled upon the iron spikes
of the fence you straddled,
you lay until the unknown.",1,1577646794,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eha0cl/blasphemy/,philosophy,1

eh6lzb,Philosopher_of_chaos,Things we're sadly not taught.,"1. When trying new things it's sadly our understanding that the purpose of which is to decide weather or not we like it, but in fact that's merely a side effect of trying new things. The point should simply be to discover and experience new things you'll find out if it's your cup of tea regardless. 

2. We're inherently selfish, and there's something you can do about it. There's a simple way to beat selfishness and that's to be selfishly selfless. It's still selfish but at least it's inclusive. 

3. Nobody wants to be unique. You have an idea of what unique is but in all reality it's a far cry from what it is in your head. You should first imagine that there's nobody else like you. When you do this, if you get excited you're doing it wrong... you should feel alone first.. People inspite of their best efforts simply cannot relate to or fully understand you. To be unique is to be one of a kind and sadly people are not loved for their differences they're hated for them. That hatred of course stems from lack of understanding though it's important to note not from a lack of trying. 

4. There are good and bad people in the world. How can we simultaneously agree that no person is perfect but attach a title such as ""good"" so freely. Well our assessment may be correct. Good people exist but our understanding is simply... for lack of a better word.. simple.  The reality as I understand it is that there are bad people and bad people working desperately on their bad. That to me is the true difference. 

5. Lastly, Some of us feel the need to insert ourselves morally in situations, where had we simply removed ourselves we could have saved a whole lot of strife. If you see a train wreck about to happen don't just jump on board. Wait for it to be over and check for survivors. You're not here to be the arbiter of fate and nobody requires you to be.",1,1577630372,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eh6lzb/things_were_sadly_not_taught/,philosophy,1

eh5sm9,h4tt3n,Trolley problem variant,"There are a number of variants of the trolley dilemma, but I find this variant very thought-provoking despite its simplicity and wanted to share it with the community. It goes like this:

Just like in the original dilemma, a trolley hurtles downhill towards a group of five people standing on the rails, threatening to kill them within moments. You stand beside a lever that enables you to switch the tracks so the trolley is diverted onto another set of rails where a single person is standing, thereby killing this person instead. What should you do? In this simple variant you pull the lever, which will save five peoples lives and doom a single person to death. Then you change your mind and push the lever back into its original position, and moments later the trolley kills the five people, while the one person lives.

I think this variant raises a number of good questions. First of all, to what extent can indecisiveness be included as a factor when judging whether you have acted morally or not? After all, in many of the horrific things that happen in the societies of the world, the indecisiveness or lack of resolve of others play a significant role. 

Also, can you walk away from the scene holding the firm conviction that you - the lever operating person - is morally without blame for what has happened? After all, from a purely technical viewpoint, the outcome was exactly the same as if you hadn't intervened, or if you hadn't been there at all.",1,1577625294,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eh5sm9/trolley_problem_variant/,philosophy,1

eh55c7,hamed_79,The problem of recognition,"Ideologies and doctrines are born of worldviews.
But What is worldview?:
Worldview is the kind of interpretation and type of analysis that a human being has about being and the world and about man and society and history.
Ideology defines what should and should not.It invites man to a goal and shows a way to that goal.Ideology says be this way, live this way, build your own this way, build your own community this way and...
And then you say to ideology why ??you tell me to be this way! why?
Why am I living this way?why do you say I choose this goal??
The worldview answers these questions!
The worldview says so be it because the world is so;because this is how humans are;this is how the human spirit is;this is the nature system and...
What is the root of the differences?why does Mr. x see the world this way and Mr. y the other way??
Because Mr. x has his own unique cognition and Mr. y has another...
But both cognitions cannot be true; at least one is wrong!

Like in the original version of the dilemma, a trolley is hurtling down the train tracks towards five people, threatening to kill them. You stand beside a lever that will enable you to switch the tracks, diverging the trolley to a different set of rails with just one person on them, who will then be killed as a result of your action. What should you do? In this variant, you pull the lever, thereby saving five people and dooming one, but then you change your mind and push the lever back in its original position again. The trolley then proceeds to kill the five people, and leaves the one person alive, exactly as if you hadn't intervened.

I think that this variant raises a number of new questions: Are you, the lever switching person, more or less guilty than if you hadn't intervened, even though - from a technical point of view - the result is the same? Can indecisiveness be drawn into the verdict on whether you are acting in a morally sound way? Can you walk away from the incident with the firm conviction that you did not kill the five people, since - technically - you did nothing to change the outcome?",1,1577618949,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eh4yt9/trolley_problem_variant/,philosophy,1

egvsq0,SomeDudeOnRedditWhiz,Arguments against democracy,"Democracy is a funny thing, and whether it is a good thing for humanity or not is a question that has puzzled me. I see very strong arguments against the whole thing, yet they feel so wrong considering the also very strong, ethical argument of letting people decide how they are to be treated. I mean, why should someone else decide someone else's lives? It is not right for your friend to dictate your life, right? They have no right to, and you yourself have the right to decide how to live yourself (as long as it is within the bounds of ""legality"", that is). And so, this logic is applied to the larger scale of a society. But does it work here? Ethically, it's the same. But it has pragmatic effects that in-turn, have ethical ramifications. These pragmatic effects are the ones I'll talk about, and also a little about how it ties into ethics. 

The fundamental argument against (that I've seen, not talking about a specific philosophical/political theory here) is that the masses don't know what's best for them. There are many reasons for this, but here's an analogy to start it off. The government can be viewed as like the parents. The people, like their children (quite fertile parents). Now, would one, as parents, allow the children to decide on their own? Parents take away a lot of liberties from their children, and for good reason. Children don't know what's best for them. They don't know how to take care of themselves. It is a biological truth. We're neurologically designed to take care of and protect children because of this fundamental fact of nature. (Not all species follow this pattern, like sharks for example, where the younglings actually stand a chance of being eaten by their mother minutes after birth. Just a little fun fact there.)

So, can one apply the same logic to the masses of a nation? Well, it seems to me you can, because they share a lot of the same features. The masses are highly susceptible to manipulation, which is not good for decision-making. Just look at the American elections (and many other elections). Very little actual substantive argumentation is going on. It's all superficial bogus, control techniques and pandering. It's more entertainment than it is an informing of political opinions. And the masses bite it. Actually, the love it. And the base their decisions on that. Of course, there is a spectrum of susceptibility to manipulation, and only the ""dumbest"" will let themselves be manipulated by the more absurd ""debate"" practices, but most people let themselves be manipulated by the more ""respectable"" politicians, who deliver nicer, yet equally empty statements.  

The masses are also very emotional, which ties into the whole susceptibility to manipulation thing. The high emotionality is a crucial factor allowing for the manipulation (though far from the only one), but it doesn't only act as a component to the manipulation. It is also a barrier for certain processes, progressions and debates. It is simply something that makes one more subjective. I don't think I need to go on much more as you all, being philosophers, probably know the gist of what I'm talking about, so I'll just mention one last thing;

The people are badly informed. Again, this is a part of the whole manipulation thing, but also a thing on it's own. But, to summarize the argument this fact creates: one isn't in a position to make a decision if one doesn't have the knowledge of the dilemma at hand, the subject of which it exists in, the ramifications of the different options, all the options actually available, the people involved, etc. And I mean, who can blame the masses for not knowing all of this. They have their lives to worry about, with their own jobs and fields to understand. Almost like it would be better if the people who made these decisions actually had it as their job to be informed about all these things. 

But, as I talked about in the beginning of this post, there is the ethical argument of allowing people to decide their own lives. Why should someone else decide for them? Well, there is an ethical argument for not having democracy, which centers around the simple ""least pain, most pleasure"" argument. If more suited people handle the decision-making, then the people will be subjected to less pain. Or well, there's been many cases of non-democratic political systems where the people have gone through agony. But many examples of the opposite. And so, it really becomes a question of whether we should stick with democracy and try to optimize it (as it is undoubtedly flawed at the moment), or rather discard democracy and go for a non-democratic political systems and try to optimize that. 

Or perhaps, a more cynical approach, we are just doomed to be dictated by negative forces and therefore we should stick with democracy because that at least gives us the autonomy to badly lead ourselves instead of having some other pricks do it. 

PS. I am aware that democracy doesn't mean the people literally vote for every little detail, but we do vote for a lot of the people who do. 

Also, a fun but relevant thought: In a way, no matter what political system you have, the people still rule, because without them, the leader has no purpose. And if up against them, the leader has no chance.",1,1577565065,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/egvsq0/arguments_against_democracy/,philosophy,1

I do not believe in Heaven, Hell or that what is responsible for our current dilemma is, in any way, the ultimate wisdom throughout the all that is everything

But many years later that abstract retort finally made sense to me

For those concerned with an afterlife, if there turns out to be one, I can only expect the selfish and greedy to desire to strongly continue on

but I would have to ask what good is a second existence if you have to live that second existence alone or with only a few other entities whom you can trust as far as you can throw?

Remember how difficult it was to find honest people in this world?

I don't believe in Hell but I also know that, if life beyond this, I won't bother with it unless we can sustain ourselves without the dependency on others. Others, in said afterlife, would only serve as company. I also know that in such an afterlife there are many whom I would not bother with at all; even less than those whom I participate with here out of dependency on an income, accommodation and sustenance.

I also believe that if all were to be revealed and everyone knew how they all serviced one another as a detriment, behind each others' backs, there will not be a whole lot of forgiveness; I don't mean forgiveness from 'God' (whatever that turns out to be) but from the independent participants themselves.",1,1577535637,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/egq5x0/your_god_might_forgive_you_but_i_wont/,philosophy,1

eg4jf4,socks_in_sandals,Career question.,"Hi. I'm supposed to choose a career for myself. I'm still young.

I  constantly think I should try to achieve a job I deem to be the most moral occupation.

When I think of it I assume the most moral occupation is as a scientist, researcher or  very successful people in other areas of society.  I think I'm less moral if I where to be a social worker than a researcher. 

My pains start when I ""rationally"" think what's most moral, but then obviously fail to reach them.

eg0fmk,HowlingFailHole,Could I do grad school?,"So, potentially pathetic question but... I've been thinking about a philosophy masters for a while... I've worked 7 years as a consultant (digital stuff) and got a low 2:i from Cambridge (UK). I am wondering whether I have any chance with literally the lowest 2:i going. I did get a 15/16 in my dissertation if that makes a difference, and struggled with anorexia (had to take a year out) and undiagnosed ADHD until about a year or two ago. But whatever my excuses, I got the lowest 2:i   mark possible (60).

I feel like what I really care about &amp; want to do is further ed in philosophy, but I'm not confident at all. I did badly at degree level (albeit at a top university??) due at least a little to my mental health problems (don't want to make excuses but I was hospitalised and am so, so much more stable now). I did well in my dissertation which relates to the area I want to study (history of phisliosophy) (15/16), but didn't do well in other areas.

My academic transcript is a mix of 1sts and low 2:is or 3rds. I feel like this relates to the ADHD in that I've always been the type to do exceptionally well in some subject s &amp; near -fail level in others. 

Is this all an excuse? Do academics care about these excuses? Is anyone likely to accept me? I was quite close to the professor who is currently head of philosophy at Edinburgh, which is one of the places my bf &amp; I are considering moving to (from London)... he convinced me to go into hospital which honestly probably saved my life. But separately I respect him deeply and feel like any department he heads up is likely to be a good one. Yet, do I suck too much to even pay to his department? Idk.

Can someone with such a low academic grade get into a postgraduate programme? I'm willing to spend time putting in extra work if it's needed, just need to understand the requirements. I know I did badly at undergrad but I really love philosophy more than I can say. I hate being a bullshit consultant. I just want to study the stuff I really care about.

Over the accumulation of the past few weeks I have come to a conclusion that there has been some sort of “split”. The “veil” is being lifted. It’s altering reality and the collective conscious and unconscious. I mention the unconscious because it seems as though, programs that have been dormant for a long time, are now active and running. Obviously I’m using terminology that best reflects in that linguistics fails to encompass. Waking life seems to remain intact, although slightly different. The tension that is built and waiting to be released is alike the climb of a beautifully orchestrated crescendo. 
I’m anticipating everything after the climax to be of bliss and creation, but the crescendo itself terrifies me, because I know the music, but I’ve forgotten how it takes me by surprise, as if it were the first time: every time. 

I need those to remember who they are and why they’re here. Volunteers to the cycle, for the greater cause. If you pick up on the lingo, let me know.

efqy0n,boyo1991,Question pertaining to the meaning of life,"So, question for everyone.

If one posits that the meaning of life is whatever you want it to be, or even the lesser of that, that the choices you make throughout life makes your meaning to life and that the meaning of life for you may change as you progress through life, we still need to talk about free will. Do you have free will to choose your meaning to your life?

I used to really like the ""you choose the meaning of your life"" thought, however, with other things that make sense such as the whole debate on free will, what's the deal?

Furthermore, some people don't even like free will to a degree, they like the illusion of it. As stated in ""the grand Inquisitor"" about how people don't want to be responsible for they're wrong doing all they have to do is admit it and wash they're hands. People don't want to be free in all actuality is what the Inquisitor posits...

So with this in mind, the question is

How have you determined the meaning of life, that is, with logic, philosophically?

So far my research has lead me to a *more* stoic perspective. I still like the existential view of us having our own meaning. That something can be true for me but not necessarily others, as long as I stick to my guns.. but I think this sorta melds the two decently? Maybe? I can try to have choices and try to make my own meaning to life. And that's what matters. All I can do, is do my best.. it's an answer that I am not sure how satisfied I am with.

These sort of things are what lead me into philosophy.. I want so desperately to be able to think in such a way that is helpful to me. And I want to hear a bunch of perspectives on this that may actually better help me come to a conclusion.

If God exists, then where did God come from, but also if God doesn’t exist then how did anything else come to exist in the first place? It’s safe to assume, no matter how you look at the flow of time (Linear or Circular), that at some point there was nothing. Not even time as we perceive it. A linear timeline would have to start somewhere and a circular timeline would have to simply pop into existence in its’ entirety from nothing at some point. Technically the circular timeline would have to go around the circle for the first time but from a perspective outside of the circle (and outside of our current perspective of time) this would likely appear instantaneous meaning from that perspective the entire circular timeline would come into existence instantaneously. Both of those perspectives leave room for there to be a God but also lead you back to the question of how that God came into existence to begin with. It really bugs me.

To the point even if they were thought of the neglect, and what real food is, there is a strong chance that they would still want there favored can, once a blue moon. I can only look to foreign foods, and things cooked up in times of poverty, to see what humans are capable of enjoying.

ef3zbv,worldcreationsociety,The Emergence of Technological Charisma,"I’ve been playing around with the notion of “Technological Charisma” and its emergent properties.

I argue that technology is no longer just a tool to amplify the charisma of individuals, but it now also serves a social function, which consequently allows the technology itself to leverage charismatic qualities. I explored the evolutionary mechanism behind charisma, how entrepreneurial propagandists leveraged it, and how technology can be designed and programmed to create an aura of charisma. 

Capturing the user’s belief in the value of the technology, combined with widespread adoption, one feels compelled to participate or risk perishing into the existential abyss. This notion brings up several implications on the future of how our society will evolve. 

Let’s take any social media platform, such as Facebook:

1. it seamlessly integrates with human’s evolutionary goals. By using the platform, humans are able to amplify their survival and replication strategies. They can use it to amplify evolutionary fitness signals (women showcasing their youth and beauty, men showcasing their ability to acquire resources for example). The better a social media platform is able to do that, the more successful it will be.
2. The widespread adoption of the platform and belief in its value gives it control over the output of information and culture on a global scale. Through algorithms and policies, these platforms can direct the type of content and media that get more attention over others. Content creators learn to adapt to the confines of the platform in order to increase engagement.
3. As a result of using this technology, the digital representation of your identity becomes your identity. You are incentivized to increase “engagement”, and as Debord puts, it creates a society of spectacle, where individuals are incentivized in producing spectacles to get engagement from their audience. It’s about appearance, to the point that experience did not happen, unless posted on social media. It can reach a point where you can’t extricate yourself from using these platforms if you wish to take part in society. An example of that taken to an extreme is Black Mirror’s Nosedive episode.

&gt; **SUMMARY INCLUDED NEAR THE END.** I feel I should emphasize because a lot of people missed the summary and it caused a great deal of confusion. Please see summary if you’d like to know what’s what.
&gt; 
&gt; #Introduction: What is Dr. STONE all about?
&gt; So, I just finished *Dr. STONE*, binged it all while studying for my physics final (which I did pretty well on, thanks for asking). It’s not perfect; I could definitely write a pretty detailed review on its aesthetic and moral accuracies and inaccuracies, but I’m willing to bet plenty of people more experienced with that sort of thing already are, and have repeated the points I’d have to make ad nauseam.
&gt; 
&gt; No, what really prompted me to write about *Dr. STONE* is not my assessment of how good the show is and whatever evidence I have to convince you that I’m right (though I do think it’s a fairly good show), but rather my claims about the accuracy of *Dr. STONE’s* claims about *science.* The show, for those unfamiliar with it, is about a teenager with superhuman scientific knowledge trying to see if he can (for reasons I won’t reveal) obtain our technology from scratch.
&gt; 
&gt; While he does this, the show explores a lot of topics central to **what science is:**
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Does science produce epistemic achievements about unobservables? That is, does science ever figure out anything? Are our best scientific theories approximating *truth?*
&gt; 2. What is the essence of science?
&gt; 3. Does science have a specific method to it? If so, what?
&gt; 4. Who should we, and scientists, recognize as having epistemic authority?
&gt; 
&gt; All of these are really important questions, but I can’t go over them all. Here’s a brief answer to each of them, and an overview of what I’ll be discussing in this post.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Experts are about four times as likely to say “yes” than “no,” but there’s still a lot of disagreement on the issue. Furthermore, despite the expert consensus on the matter, scientists at large seem to disagree, with many leading scholars observing that scientists tend to hold or express what are called “anti-realist” attitudes.
&gt; 2. Not any of the main answers prior to the last few decades.
&gt; 3. No, “the scientific method” is a myth (though fortunately, people are [listening more and more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522609/) to experts on the matter) and there’s likely no such thing, though often useful for teaching those unfamiliar with science about it.
&gt; 4. There’s disagreement, but there’s been a stronger push away from hard distinctions between observers and subjects in terms of epistemic authority, and naïve notions of objectivity. Much research shows that they have an ironic tendency of moving us away from the objective truth.
&gt; 
&gt; I could talk at great length about all of these issues and how the shows explore them. I’m especially passionate about 4. But I’ll be going with 2, and briefly, 3.
&gt; 
&gt; I should clarify that I don’t think the show (and presumably manga)  is wildly inaccurate, bordering on pseudoscience or anything. Indeed, it’s *specifically the fact* that the manga is so well-researched, accurate, and pays so much attention to detail *that* it makes for a good subject of analysis. I mean, who would want to see me give a detailed analysis of how *Ant-Man* or *Avengers: Endgame* is at odds with science? I think everyone can tell the films were playing it a bit fast and loose with quantum mechanics (and classical mechanics, and their own mechanics, etc.).
&gt; 
&gt; But *Dr. STONE* can be so accurate that where it gets things wildly inaccurate becomes *especially* interesting. It’s actually so good that instead of writing a paper like my professor asked for for my final assignment, I wrote a *Dr. STONE* (and *Back to the Future*) inspired short story that explores the four issues I just listed above. I won’t be sharing that story, of course; it was a rushed, 3-day final project, but this should speak to just how much I fell in love with elements from this show.
&gt; 
&gt; So. What is the essence of science?
&gt; #How Dr. STONE drops the philosophers’ stone: What Senku says
&gt; Senku makes a lot of offhand comments about what science is. While the show proposes several positions with respect to all four topics above, I’ll be focusing on the things relating to topics 2 and 3. Some stuff worth going over are Senku’s claims that:
&gt; 
&gt; * Figuring out the [underlying rules](https://i.imgur.com/Pyiz78f.png) or mechanisms of phenomena is the [basis of science](https://i.imgur.com/I7KouZU.png).
&gt; * Scientific method essentially involves [hypothesizing and experimenting over and over](https://i.imgur.com/iSscDF3.png).
&gt; * [Science](https://i.imgur.com/l9d8O59.png) is that method whereby you [figure out](https://i.imgur.com/TyZbGRC.png) the [rules](https://i.imgur.com/X4noIDZ.png) that are [behind things](https://i.imgur.com/2D4EnpY.png) (minor S01E01 spoilers).
&gt; * [Science is fundamentally pragmatic](https://i.imgur.com/Yu6SKvn.png).
&gt; 
&gt; Some of these, I might mention or comment on in passing while saying quite a bit more on the others. So, what does Senku get right and what does Senku get wrong?
&gt; #Is Senku right about hypothesizing, experimenting, and replication? Let’s find out.
&gt; #Is Senku right about hypothesizing, experimenting, and replication? Let’s find out.
&gt; Senku claims that **science involves hypothesizing and experimenting over and over, slowly, to refute another character’s claim that science was epistemically failing them.** Is it true that these are **necessary** (Senku seems to be claiming that these are necessary rather than sufficient conditions for science; the latter claim would be a bit more untenable) **conditions for science?**
&gt; 
&gt; There’s a lot to be said about whether hypotheses and experiments are necessary to science, but I think I’ll give Senku those since I think the last part is a bit more interesting (and it’s a bit harder to adjudicate what exactly Senku means with the former components, and some ways of interpreting it might run into issues with cases like Bell’s theorem).
&gt; 
&gt; Science seems to **centrally** need replication and reproducibility, does it not? That’s why, after all, the purported replication crisis we’ve had for some time now seems so fundamentally *troubling* for science.
&gt; 
&gt; But as historian of science Friedrich Steinle will note, while replication is *important,* it’s not so essential that science can be accurately described as the process of hypothesizing and experimenting over and over. Sometimes, you hypothesize, do an experiment, and there’s no demand for replication at all, which, by Steinle’s lights, appears to be a correct judgment. So as it turns out, science’s relationship to replication and reproducibility is *incredibly complex,* and a great deal of research by historians, philosophers, and social scientists has been necessary to understand this relationship.
&gt; 
&gt; Steinle offers an example, noting that “The first vacuum pump was designed and put in operation by the Magdeburg mayor and former technical advisor Otto von Guericke in the 1650….Guericke’s apparatus was unique, complicated, expensive, and difficult to handle….In any case, it is clear that replication was not an issue for Guericke; but even without replication, no doubts were raised about his results. This had probably to do with his public performance that could be witnessed by a large number of participants.” There’s no reason to think that the common sense of scientists at the time was wrongheaded. The judgment that replication was unnecessary in the case of Guericke’s experiment, and unnecessary to science overall, seems to be a very strong datum that it is, in fact, not necessary. This doesn’t mean replication can be *neglected* or that it’s *unimportant,* Steinle himself will note that it’s clearly necessary in all sorts of cases. But here, it was not. The need for replication is incredibly contextual, and it is not a part of the necessary or sufficient conditions of science.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, there may be no such things as necessary or sufficient conditions of science. To elaborate, let’s consider the two related claims that science is fundamentally about figuring out underlying rules, and that it is the “pain-in-the-ass” method by which we discover those underlying rules.
&gt; #Getting directly at the several millennia old issue: What is the essence of science, and what does Dr. STONE get wrong about science?
&gt; So, what about those two claims?
&gt; 
&gt; They’re actually precedented. What Senku is claiming here is rooted in a mish mash of historical events, but, as I’ll demonstrate, what these events teach us is actually that Senku is rather confused about what it is that science is. First, we’ll need to talk about the problem we’re grappling with here, then the history of the problem, and finally what we can draw from that history.
&gt; ##What’s the problem?
&gt; What we’re dealing with is called the demarcation problem, and it’s a problem we’ve been facing for over two millennia. It’s an incredibly important problem, and is the engine behind a great many events in intellectual history. The importance of this problem to those events is to such a severe extent that some historians or those interested in history have considered it disappointing that those events are taught without this incredibly necessary context.
&gt; 
&gt; So, what is the demarcation problem and why is it so damned important that it’s so central to so many historical events? Briefly:
&gt; 
&gt; * ***The demarcation problem:* The problem of figuring out what is and isn’t science.**
&gt; 
&gt; Why is this so important? Well, science has a lot of epistemic weight. Since the ancient era, we listened to scientists. When they said something was going on, we took them at their word. That is, they have epistemic authority. We teach our children, as well as adults, what the results of science were and what scientists are doing today. We fund scientists. And we do all of these things to science in a way where we don’t do it to that which isn’t science; we rightly pass on scientific knowledge and not pseudoscientific knowledge, or at least we try or purport to.
&gt; 
&gt; Short of the infeasible task of getting all legislators and everyone else familiar with every branch of academia and its pseudo-counterparts, sufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, we’re gonna need a demarcation between science and non-science.
&gt; 
&gt; With that in mind, what are some things we want from a theory of what demarcates science and non-science? For ease of reference, I’ll call these **desiderata** from here on out.
&gt; ###The **desiderata** of demarcation
&gt; I’ll not only be going over the desiderata of demarcation, but why those desiderata are justified. A demarcation between science and non-science should:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. **be in line with actual scientific practice,**
&gt; 2. **provide the necessary conditions of science,**
&gt; 3. **provide the sufficient conditions of science, and**
&gt; 4. **explain the normative properties of science (i.e. why it’s so valuable in all the ways we think it’s valuable.**
&gt; 
&gt; So , **why do we need to satisfy all four desiderata?** I’ll consider them one by one.
&gt; 
&gt; **(1) Why should a solution to the demarcation problem actually describe scientific practice?** A solution should aim to fit within the sciences those paradigmatic sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology. For consider if the demarcation only purported to show some non-actual, ideal demarcation. How would a solution do any of what we want it to then? If physics isn't a science, then our desire to take physicists to be authoritative cannot come from our desire to take scientists in general to be authoritative, since that desire corresponds to non-actual scientists.
&gt; 
&gt; **(2) Why should a solution to the demarcation problem provide the necessary conditions for science?** If it only gave the sufficient conditions, then certainly, we'd be able to know when some investigation isn't pseudo-scientific, is authoritative or worthwhile as such, etc. But now, we'd have no ability to know when some investigation isn't pseudo-scientific, shouldn't be paid any heed, shouldn't be funded, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; **(3) Why should a solution to the demarcation problem provide the sufficient conditions for science?** If it only gave the necessary conditions, then certainly, we'd be able to know when some investigation is pseudo-scientific, isn't authoritative or worthwhile as such, etc. But now, we'd have no ability to know when some investigation is pseudo-scientific, shouldn't be paid any heed, shouldn't be funded, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; **(4) Why should a solution to the demarcation problem make it clear why science is valuable?** If all we're doing is just coming up with some unimportant, formal distinction between fields, the problem wouldn't be any more important than demarcating between various sciences. Sure, we think there's a difference between physics and biology, but if it came to light that this wasn't the case, would it matter, and would everyone focus intensely on figuring out the demarcation? A solution to the demarcation problem should let us know what to fund, who to listen to, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; So, without further ado, here is the history of answers to this problem.
&gt; ##What have we already tried?
&gt; It’s a little ambiguous what exactly Senku is saying, but I think I have a good idea of what he might be trying to get at. So I’ll try to go over the history (with much thanks to Larry Laudan) independently of Senku’s thoughts, and then offer my comments on what Senku is trying to get across.
&gt; ###A. Aristotle
&gt; So, with the four desiderata in mind, what solutions have been provided throughout the history of philosophy and science to the problem? What did people think was the difference between science and non-science? We can trace this problem back to Parmenides of Ancient Greece. Concerns about the difference between episteme, or knowledge, and doxa, or mere opinion, loomed large. Aristotle provided a solution in his *Posterior Analytics,* positing that scientific knowledge had to involve indisputable, complete, absolute certainty. After all, if scientific beliefs are as uncertain as the rest of our beliefs, it's not obvious that there would be any hard divide between scientific knowledge and mere opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; He also thought that scientific knowledge must involve more than knowing how to do things, but knowing why those things work. I may know that trees lose their leaves in fall because of wind blowing them away, but this is not scientific knowledge. I must demonstrate how this occurs from more fundamental, general causes for scientific knowledge. So, scientific knowledge would be deeper, like the knowledge that less sunlight limits chlorophyll which is needed for leaves to stick to trees.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, science had to be “derived from first principles,” so to speak. You can think of Aristotle’s “first principles” as something like the most basic laws of nature. What Aristotle had in mind *specifically,* was the prevailing geocentric theory having to do with elements. This part of history may be a little more popularly known than some of the other parts. Back in the day, the universe was thought to be geocentric; the Earth was at the center. Why? Was this just some sort of self-importance on our part? No, this seemed to best explain a lot of the phenomena we were witnessing. There were four fundamental elements. There were heavy, Earth-y things, or Fire-y things that went up. But up, down, etc. in relation to what? The Earth. Everything they observed seemed to have the Earth as a “telos,” as Aristotle would say. And they could *see* that. They could apparently sit down and observe, over and over, that all Earth-y objects have, as their telos, the Earth while Fire-y objects went away from the Earth.
&gt; 
&gt; So, they were certain of that much. There was no denying that there were four elements, that interactions between these elements and the rules they played by explained all phenomena. So, if it could just be demonstrated that something was *entailed* from these first principles, such a thing could be known for certain just like these first principles.
&gt; 
&gt; For science, we need principles which we are certain of and can logically derive facts of the world from, and we need to know what is fundamentally happening, on a deeper level, with our observations. This is what gives us absolute certainty.
&gt; ###B. Seventeenth and eighteenth century
&gt; By the time of Galileo and Newton, the need to figure out what was fundamentally going on at a deeper level was no longer taken to be needed for science. ~~Galileo~~ Newton refused to figure out why what he was saying was true, but all the same, he knew what he said of free-falling bodies was true with absolute certainty. ~~Newton~~ Galileo similarly didn't claim to know why the celestial bodies moved the way he said they did, but he said he was coming up with theories directly from the phenomena and so he was sure. He wanted to know why, but felt that was unimportant to his theories being scientific.
&gt; 
&gt; There were two driving forces behind dropping the second demarcative component devised by Aristotle, and keeping only certainty. First, it didn’t match up with the sciences. By this time, and even before, by the time of Ptolemy, mathematical astronomy was not at all deriving the trajectories of the celestial bodies from first principles. Astronomers were simply figuring out correlations between the movements of the celestial bodies and other bodies, the seasons, and so on. Explanation from first principles was no consideration at all. Some bit the bullet that astronomers just weren’t scientists, but this was a hard bullet to bite since it seems rather clear that we should listen to astronomers.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, there was an extremely worrying revolution that shook every scientist and philosopher to her core. The fall of geocentrism and the very first principles that all scientific knowledge had been derived from since then. After this, there was very little agreement over how it was that scientific knowledge was absolutely certain. René Descartes was someone who famously sought to show how we could have scientific knowledge. Certainty was very important, hence he dug down to find a belief in which he was certain, which he thought was his famous Cogito: I think, therefore I am. He thought we could derive all of science from *this,* and that’s how we could be certain of scientific knowledge. This wasn’t a fruitless endeavor. While he developed this attempt at demarcation, he discovered a lot that we still use to this day. For instance, it was Descartes who came up with science as being concerned with mechanisms and laws of nature, something physicists still do today. Prior to then, science was an investigation into teleology and purpose, not mechanisms and laws. This was a fundamental shift in our empirical investigations, one that has persisted in all sciences and one we can thank Descartes for.
&gt; 
&gt; When David Hume potentially showed that we couldn't even form any justification by which we could derive our predictions from just our observations beyond practical need, Immannuel Kant freaked out and spent the rest of his life coming up with an entire system of philosophy meant to show how science could be justified to a point of certainty as well as metaphysics as a science, which was concerned with only a small set of questions which could be answered in metaphysics (anticipating later attempts to throw out metaphysics, he too threw away much of it).
&gt; 
&gt; Newton, Kant, Descartes, Locke, Bacon, etc. argued all the time, then, over how it is scientific knowledge is infallible. But nobody denied that, of course, it was, if done right, infallible. If they just figured out how to do it right, they’d obtain certain knowledge.
&gt; ###C. Nineteeth century
&gt; By the nineteenth century, the fallibility of all of our beliefs became dominantly accepted, and so this solution could not do any longer. But if not complete and indisputable certainty, what could distinguish science from non-science? Researchers in the nineteenth century tried to demarcate science from non-science via method. There must have been some identifiable scientific method by which it could be shown that some pursuits were scientific and some were not.
&gt; 
&gt; The scientific method, they reasoned, could still be fallible, could still lead to mistakes, and so on, and so there was no threat of making the same mistake as the infallibilists of all the eras before them. But this method of testing would allow us to correct ourselves so that we could keep progressing despite our mistakes in our pursuit of knowledge. This attitude can be summarized in E.V. Davis’s pithy remark that, “""if science lead us astray, more science will set us straight.”
&gt; 
&gt; To be clear, the idea that there was some specific method of going about scientific investigation was not a new idea. But the idea that it was fallible, but still the best method of forming knowledge, *was* new. So, everyone tried to figure out what was in common between the sciences, and how it was that this method was better than other methods of trying to figure things out. Various proposals were made, but all of them were not only vague, they didn't even actually match what scientists were doing. Furthermore, nobody was able to explain how their proposed methods were better at forming knowledge than any of the other proposals.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, it is taken to be the case that there simply is *no such thing* as ""the scientific method."" Despite this, as noted in the following two links (also check their citations, especially Bauer's *Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method*), many science educators and the public at large still act as if it exists:
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522609/  
&gt; https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-method/#SciMetSciEduSeeSci
&gt; ###D. Twentieth century
&gt; So, certainty doesn't work. Fundamentality doesn't work. Methodology doesn't work. Maybe distinguishing science and non-science via semantics and meaningfulness would work.
&gt; 
&gt; This was a large part of the attempts of the members of the Vienna circle, a group of scientists and philosophers who started a movement known as **logical positivism.** Logical positivism was an incredibly complex movement, which few contemporary summaries do justice. But to give an idea of the movement, I’ll briefly discuss their motivations and two prominent formulations of one of their central theses.
&gt; ####FORMULATING EARLY LOGICAL POSITIVISM
&gt; **Logical positivism** rose with the apparent increase in success of **scientific, logical, mathematical, and linguistic** investigation. Feeling the need to throw out all of philosophy which did not appear to show the promise of similar success, logical positivists aimed to restrict what sentences were meaningful down to much less. This would, in effect, allow them to put front and center the sciences, the mathematics, and so on, throwing out what they took to me nonsensical metaphysics. You can consider this a birthplace of certain scientistic cultural elements which persist to this very day.
&gt; 
&gt; It should be made clear that the logical positivists came off the heels of an era of philosophy where philosophers would make claims like ""The absolute is perfect"" or ""Nothingness nothings,"" which the logical positivists saw as just a bunch of pseudo-poetic nonsense, as evidenced by their lack of any form of measurable success against their scientific counterparts, who made claims like ""This is the data we should expect from this experiment."" The logical positivists were much more sympathetic to the latter form of claims. They really seemed to mean something and weren't just apparently pseudo-poetic word salad, and they really seemed to be getting at some sort of success.
&gt; 
&gt; Another causally relevant factor was that Bertrand Russell had a significant influence on how the logical positivists thought of philosophy in the Medieval era. Russell would often mischaracterize them because he really hated them, and many of the logical positivists simply trusted Russell’s account after Russell became a central figure in philosophy due to his immense contributions to logic, mathematics, and the philosophies thereof. So, they aimed to throw away much of medieval philosophy too, which we know now was a grave mistake on their part, perhaps even more problematic than their belief that the claims in the previous paragraph were meaningless word salad.
&gt; 
&gt; **In short, scientific investigation was good, nonsensical metaphysical investigation, whatever that was, was silly.**
&gt; 
&gt; With those motivations in mind, in what follows, I will explain early logical positivism and its death as briefly as I can. I can elaborate should anyone be interested in these problems, but I suspect nobody will be, and so I will cut myself short on each part.
&gt; 
&gt; Early logical positivists defended the **verificationist criterion of meaning,** meaning they believed that all declarative sentences were:
&gt; 
&gt; **A. Analytic:** True or false in virtue of the meanings of the terms (e.g. ""All squares have four sides,"" ""All ravens are birds"").  
&gt; **B. Empirically verifiable:** Logically entailed from some finite set of possible observation (sentences), or could in principle be verified by some finite set of observation (sentences).  
&gt; **C. Meaningless.** It’s difficult to make out exactly what this means, but importantly, it meant that something wasn’t worth investigating.
&gt; 
&gt; This account *failed.*
&gt; 
&gt; **First,** it couldn’t account for sentences of universal form, or sentences of the form “All *F* is *G,*” or “Each *x* is such that if it is *F,* it is *G,*” or to put it symbolically, “(∀x)(Fx⊃Gx).” For example, claims like “All stars emit light” or “All electrons repel other electrons.” These weren’t true or false in virtue of the meanings of the terms alone, nor was it possible for them to be entailed by some finite set of observations (or rather, the sentences for those observations).
&gt; 
&gt; **Second,** it couldn’t resist the addition of meaningless disjuncts. Via disjunction introduction, the purportedly meaningless sentences could be added on without problem.
&gt; 
&gt; **Third,** it made certain claims about the same very same thing, of the very same subject, etc. meaningful while their counterparts were meaningless. For example, “unicorns exist” would be meaningful under this criterion, while “unicorns don’t exist” would not be. Why? Well, you may know that all positive statements are logically equivalent to some negative statement. This is often brought up when someone debunks the myth that “you can’t prove a negative.” But perhaps less known is that you can take this further: negative existential statements are logically equivalent to some positive universal sentence, such that negative existential statements run into the problem of being sentences of universal form, and thus (as previously demonstrated) meaningless.
&gt; 
&gt; A demarcation which distinguishes between “unicorns exist” and “unicorns don’t exist” as scientific or not is deeply, and perhaps fatally, problematic.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fourth,** Gödel's theorem, often summarized as truth outrunning provability in formal systems, demonstrated that for any language with a finite set of axioms (and inference rules) that let you do some arithmetic, some sentences within that language can't be proven or disproven. This meant that, contrary to the hopes of the logical positivists, mathematics couldn’t all be accounted for analytically via a small set of syntactic rules.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fifth,** the early criterion was self-defeating. The criterion itself was neither analytic nor empirically verifiable. So, if the criterion was correct, then it was meaningless. Otherwise, it was incorrect. A.J. Ayer’s defense against this claim involved taking “meaningless” to be an academic term of art, simply *defined* a certain way, but that would mean that it has nothing to do with whether something is worth investigating or whether some research was worth respecting.
&gt; 
&gt; **In short, early logical positivism faced a lot of problems, any of which were individually fatal to it, which prompted later developments.**
&gt; 
&gt; Later on, many logical positivists (though I emphasize again the incredibly diversity of the movement) defended the **translatability criterion of meaning,** meaning they believed that all declarative sentences were either:
&gt; 
&gt; **A. Empirically translatable:** Translatable into an empiricist language, which, following Hempel, I'll denote as *L.*  
&gt; **B. Meaningless.**
&gt; 
&gt; What does it mean for a sentence to be translatable into language *L?* This can be left a little bit open, so that various languages are proposed which would satisfy the motivations of the logical positivists. But Hempel considers a specific proposal for *L* that he thinks at least approaches being a serious contender. *L* is any language wherein:
&gt; 
&gt; **C. The vocabulary of *L*** contains **(i)** logical expressions like ""if...then,"" ""not,"" ""and,"" ""or,"" ""all,"" ""some,"" and so on, **(ii)** certain observation predicates, where observation predicates are terms which designate directly observable characteristics like ""green,"" ""soft,"" and ""taller than,"" and so on, and finally **(iii)** any expression which can be defined via the terms of i and ii.  
&gt; **D. The syntax of *L*** is the syntax of some contemporary logical system, like that of the Principia Mathematica.
&gt; 
&gt; **If you don't quite get that, that's fine;** the basic idea here is that there is this language which is entirely restricted to sentences which would describe something we can observe and investigate. It has to be about a direct observation, or something that a direct observation implies. If you say ""Hey, my good is green,"" I can do some science on that claim and be like ""Yep, sure is, Sam-I-Am,"" or ""Nope, I am afraid you are outside of your mind with respect to the coloration of those items, my dear friend Sam-I-Am."" If you say ""Hey, this glowing stuff is radioactive,"" then even though I can't directly observe radiation, I can do some science on *that* claim too because it entails certain direct observations.
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully, that gives at least some blurry shape to this criterion.
&gt; 
&gt; **This solves all of the old problems (will elaborate if needed), but comes with fatal new problems.**
&gt; 
&gt; **First,** it can’t account for dispositional terms like “fragile.” We can do this today thanks to the advent of possible worlds semantics (which is also how we know, with nearly unanimous consensus, that there exist other possible worlds), but even that probably wouldn’t have helped the translatability criterion.
&gt; 
&gt; **Second,** by the 1950s, plenty of highly sophisticated theoretical abstracts simply couldn’t be defined or reduced to observation predicates. These include terms like “wavefunction” or “electric field.”
&gt; 
&gt; **Third,** accounting for inductive inference syntactically made inductive inference relative or underdetermined by anything other than language. Inductive inference is central to our everyday lives. When you decided to eat food rather than drink arsenic for nutrition this morning, you inferred from what you’ve observed what experiences you haven’t observed would be like. Any theory that can’t account for this is wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; In response to problems like this, even later thinkers would allow for theories which had any observational component(s) at all, so long as the rest of the theory was broadly, appropriately, liberally related to those observational components.
&gt; 
&gt; But of course, research in metaphysics, much like theoretical physics, *does* do that. This marked the end of the anti-metaphysics and anti-philosophy of logical positivism, as it was demonstrated despite their best efforts that **it seemed impossible to demarcate between the sciences and metaphysics.** Later on, logical positivism died.
&gt; 
&gt; What were some other attempts worth mentioning in the twentieth century? Karl Popper thought that maybe the sciences were falsifiable while the non-sciences weren’t, but this position is as dead as logical positivism. Others thought that science was unique in that it progressed, while non-sciences didn’t, but this doesn’t turn out well at all either. Others interpreted science pragmatically and as having to do with its useful and practical applications, but this didn’t work out either.
&gt; 
&gt; Others have done great work on how these failed, but with this section dragging on a bit, I’ll just note for one of them that clearly, plenty of non-scientific fields progress, like literary criticism, metaethics, history, foundations of quantum mechanics, military strategy, etc. We certainly know more in those fields than we did a century ago, it’d be absurd to tell a military general otherwise. On the other hand, plenty of sciences don’t or didn’t progress for a very long time, tentative candidates brought up by Larry Laudan being: “acoustics from 1750 to 1780; human anatomy from 1900 to 1920; kinematic astronomy from 1200 to 1500; rational mechanics from 1910
&gt; to 1940.”
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps an even bigger problem with some of the attempts in the twentieth century is many of them, Popper’s and A.J. Ayer’s in particular, **failed to meet the fourth desiderata.** They became much closer to simply esoteric distinctions without implications.
&gt; ###E. Do we have a solution today?
&gt; So, are we still trying to figure out the demarcation problem now? Or did we figure it out? I think it’s the latter. But insofar as we’re trying to understand what Senku says (he never does touch on the correct answer), this is likely mostly irrelevant for our purposes. But I’ll make a few notes here so as to not leave readers unsatisfied, then move on.
&gt; 
&gt; The contemporary answer usually involves giving up necessary and sufficient conditions altogether. This is as revolutionary as it is deeply problematic for practical reasons. Let me offer a historical fact that I’m uniquely situated to give. Once upon a time, there was a United States Supreme Court case meant to decide once and for all whether creationism should be taught in schools. The answer is, of course, that it should not be.
&gt; 
&gt; So, the supreme court brought in a very well known expert on the matter: Michael Ruse. Michael Ruse was going to adjudicate on what was and wasn’t science for the purposes of the United States Supreme Court, and was going to change the world with it. What was Michael Ruse’s answer? Something like logical positivism.
&gt; 
&gt; Why did he do this? Well, Michael Ruse happens to be my professor’s professor, and so I have a bit of insight into what Ruse was thinking here via what he said when his student asked him about his decision to give a false answer to the demarcation question when he was asked for the goods.
&gt; 
&gt; Here’s the problem. The newer answers have no necessary or sufficient conditions. The Supreme Court can’t work with that. But obviously, *we need to keep creationism out of schools.* The older answers lacked the normative component, and also were demonstrably not the correct necessary and sufficient conditions, but you could *work* with them. You could clearly adjudicate on what was and wasn’t science for legislative purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; But even if all the answers involve quite a bit of vagueness, resistant to the sort of judgments practically necessary, we do have answers. These days, demarcative questions involve quite a bit of vagueness. Laudan himself suggests simply giving up terms like “pseudoscience” and “non-science,” researching only into what knowledge is and isn’t reliable. So, on the one end, you have fields like history, metaethics, literary criticism, biology, foundations of quantum mechanics, modal semantics, mathematics, causation, and so on. These fields give us reliable knowledge. Then, closer to the other end of the spectrum, you have things like social Darwinism, creationism, Myers-Briggs typology, objectivism, acupuncture, conversion therapy, and so on. These fields, theories, topics, etc. don’t give us or involve reliable knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; And then, between the reliable sciences and non-sciences, it’s not uncommon (though not unanimous) to see another sort of spectrum. On one end, you have research that might be thought of as more “direct” or “observational.” Further away, you have more theoretical fields. So, modal semantics, the foundations of quantum mechanics, moral ontology, causation, physical cosmology, and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; In short, many contend that the search for strict demarcation has ended, for better or worse, contrary to what Senku seems to want.
&gt; ##What does this mean for Senku? Why is he wrong? (Summary included)
&gt; Senku claims that the basis of science is figuring out underlying rules. But as we’ve seen, this Aristotelian view of science didn’t work out so well. Now, of course, one reason was that our understanding of underlying rules wasn’t infallible, which is hardly a problem for us today, seeing as we’re fallibilists. But another is that plenty of sciences simply *don’t* look for underlying mechanisms explaining the phenomena, etc. I gave the example of astronomy, which for the longest time did no such thing. There are plenty of other examples today. Indeed, many *physicists* complain that this is the case for large swathes of their field.
&gt; 
&gt; He also expresses a belief in **the scientific method.** But after intense research in the nineteenth century, it doesn’t seem like there’s any such thing. Throughout history, much research, being done clearly as it ought to be, didn’t involve many things often purported to be methodologically necessary, like replication or hypothesizing.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I’d love to write more, and if enough people find any part of this interesting, I *plan* to write more, whether to elaborate on certain things I cut short here or to answer the other questions I listed that the show tackles. But you gotta make the cut somewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; All in all, despite these inaccuracies, I don’t want people to be left with the notion that this show is overall scientific hogwash. While it gets its central and fundamental questions wrong, the research into other areas are pretty detailed.
&gt; 
&gt; I’d love to talk to the mangaka, Riichiro Inagaki, about all of this. I wouldn’t just bring up the flaws I just mentioned, but my adoration of the show and the aesthetic context it exists in. I’d want them to understand both these flaws and what an incredible achievement with respect to representations of science it is. But alas, I have no way of communicating to Inagaki at this time! Maybe one day, hey?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, to summarize like I did in the other sections, the show explores a lot of topics central to **what science is,** two of which are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. What is the essence of science?
&gt; 2. Does science have a specific method to it? If so, what?
&gt; 
&gt; Here’s a brief answer to both:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Not any of the main answers prior to the last few decades.
&gt; 2. No, “the scientific method” is a myth (though fortunately, scientists are [listening more and more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522609/) to experts on the matter) and there’s likely no such thing, though often useful for teaching those unfamiliar with science about it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Senku has something of a mish mash between Aristotle's, Descartes's(?), and the nineteenth century account, and unfortunately, all of these have been debunked.**
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully, everyone’s gained something from all of this. Let me know and let me know if it’s worth writing the rest of what I’d like to write about on the matter. :)",1,1577125040,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eeo9fc/what_dr_stone_gets_wrong_when_it_comes_to_its/,philosophy,1

Chaos is a creation factor that is woven all throughout this universe the second law of thermodynamics says that chaos is the natural direction of the universe, it requires no energy for chemical reactions to occur two chemicals just need to be near each other and the bonding process just happens. In contrast the opposite doesn’t happen naturally, it requires some amount of energy or work to push things in the opposite direction like separating chemicals. So if chaos is the driving factor for creation in the universe maybe chaos created the universe itself, maybe the Big Bang was chaos sneaking into a still, cold, empty universe and being the catalyst for expansion which then created the universe.

eedp4n,insignia37,a perspective.,"Resonance – all artifacts, or things that we as humans can experience, possess a trivial yet fascinating phenomena of resonance, or responding to events (with time), in such a way that they flourish when in cohesion, with the ‘resonant’ or ‘natural’ frequency of our states at any given time. 

In physics this frequency is known as the natural (resonant) frequency, one specific to all shapes and containers, all particles and all of matter. The response observed in the natural world, is one where when an external source produces an oscillation, say directed into a container, the container amplifies certain frequencies (the superposition of which composes the oscillation), within accordance with the resonant frequency of the container. This phenomenon is defined to be resonance.

It is important to note that all oscillations are in relation to time, time being the chosen reference frame upon which the ups and downs (or physical displacement of matter/energy) can be mapped. Taking time out of the equation, would make visualizing such effects very difficult indeed, for we as humans are fundamentally subject to the same physical laws as the rest of the universe – and that is a key concept to have if we wish to bring clarity to all this chaos around us. Chaos in fact leads nicely on to entropy (the natural decrease of order/increase of disorder with time), and is why time has only ever flowed in one direction (as far as we know) – flowing from past to future; the present merely being a place holder to explain this eventuality that constantly repeats itself (every second of every minute of every hour…). 

That for now however, should be the fundamental concepts to explain all of the natural phenomena you perceive and experience around you, and will lay the foundations for understanding this passage - so try to have at least a basic idea of what they represent (oscillations, perturbations, resonance, natural frequency and time being the buzzwords). 

You may say, as I once did, that knowing this is all well and good, but what am I meant do with it, where do I go from here?

ee3tq4,riveriveriveriver,A paradox in atheism?,"Disclaimers: I was an atheist for years and have generally been agnostic since then. I am not at all an expert in philosophy, my formal study of such not reaching beyond high school and the rest of my knowledge obtained from my own research. The following is merely an argument I’ve been contemplating over the past few days. I’m also not sure if this post is slightly better suited for a physics board due to some use of a physics principle, but my intuition tells me philosophy makes most sense since the issue is ultimately metaphysical. So, here goes.

Two particular positions held by most atheists I know are that:
1) There is no life after death.
2) There is no reality beyond physical/material reality.

What I’m thinking is that these two positions cannot exist in tandem.

At least in the physical realm, we know according to the first law of thermodynamics that nothing can be truly created or destroyed— only transformed. This applies to everything from galaxies to insects; even on the basest level, we know that the atoms of the human body replace themselves every 7-10 years.

So if we assume there to be no reality beyond the physical, meaning that life is merely an emergent phenomenon representing a chain of physical phenomena, then surely life itself would have to follow this rule? If there is no reality beyond the physical, and everything physical is neither created or destroyed but merely rearranged, then surely life cannot be understood as a singular journey with a beginning and ending but rather something more along the lines of continual reincarnation?

Alternatively we can approach this from the opposite end by making our first proposition the finite nature of life. If life HAS to be finite, then mustn’t we also concede that life MUST be facilitated by some immaterial mechanism? Otherwise, how could it truly emerge or cease? Material things can’t do that.",1,1577013179,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ee3tq4/a_paradox_in_atheism/,philosophy,1

Immoral=not conforming to accepted standards of morality .. 

morality=principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior.

Wicked=morally very bad


So the word evil means not obeying society’s distinction between good and bad behavior.  
So does that mean everyone is evil? Everyone has done something “immoral” because immoral just means not conforming to the distinction between right and wrong.  Everyone has done wrong in their lives.  So, in conclusion, based off these definitions.  Mankind is inherently evil.

if the mind is doing this to just basic questions, what else is the mind doing to produce outcomes? if so what else?

my view on the first part is yes. the reason I believe is that our minds know that anything in it can manipulated to fix our beliefs. the external world is limited and so its the control and our mind hold the variables.

well initially our point of life was to reproduce like how the point of a rock is to sit there and exist but once we got enough knowledge and sentience to escape that constant loop of doing our duty which was made simply for the purpose of being made and having to happen eventually over the billions of years this planet has existed for, we started to find other meanings in lifei guess then that life is actually a mistakewe are errors in the system which created us just for to be created and for no purpose in particularidk if im wording this as well as it sounds in my headjust a thought📷

ecknac,TheElected,When is something considered alive?,"Let's analyze the word ""Alive"", the dictionary says that it means living, not dead. Let's see the word living shall we? It literally means alive. So let's see the word dead, it means no longer alive, not dead means that its not no longer alive. So what does it mean? Alive means living and living means alive, dead means no longer alive. It's a virtuous cycle. So let's ask ourselves, what is the true meaning of living? Let's analyze something that is alive. At first sight something alive moves on its own. Also the wind moves though, but we do not consider it to be alive, so let's analyze some more. A living being at first sight moves, then it produces sounds, still nothing, then it can react to some external contact, like if you touch a living being it will move itself reacting to your touch. That's something more like it. Yet, do we consider something to be alive only when it's capable to move on its own and when it reacts to external contact? Let's see water, you touch water and it moves, reacting to your external contact."" It moves"" also enters in our first condition for something to be alive, correct? Then it is not it. Let's change it a bit, it moves, it reacts to external contact. After a while, it ceases moving. Wind never ceases to move. Water never ceases to react to external contact. That is the thing. The keyword is ""cease"". What is cease? It means stop, right? And stop means come to an end. In synthesis?

In the end, it's this faith that leads love to the world we have today, built on the stories of love that drove ambition wild. So call me a sucker and allow this heart to flourish. I pray I don't put down the loneliness that others also cope in search for love. Understand first that balance is learning the lessons love provides. Take a leap of faith love exist and do the right thing, because it turns out love will and always has existed.

ec5fle,goorboor05,Predicate logic and the contraposition rule,"I was thinking about a specific scenario in predicate logic that seems to produce an incorrect result.  Perhaps the reddit community can help me make sense of it. 

Ax = x is an animal, Hx = x is a human, Mx = x is a mortal

If I produce the statement, (x)\[Ax -&gt; (\~Hx -&gt; Mx)\], or how I read this in English: Any animal that is not human is mortal.  This statement is true, as all non-human animals are indeed mortal.  However, when I perform a contraposition (and a double negation, for clarity) on the statement, which should be an equivalent logically, and retain the same truth value I get:

(x)\[Ax -&gt; (\~Mx -&gt; Hx)\].... This, in English, would be: Any animal that is immortal is human...or Humans are the only animal that is not mortal.  This is obviously an untrue statement, so it seems this isn't preserving the truth as it is supposed to.  

I am interested in seeing what more experienced logicians (I'm a relative noob), have to comment about this scenario.  Am I in the wrong for implicitly excluding humans from other mortal animals?  It seems like a fair statement to me.  Is it because of the limitations or peculiarities of the conditional?

ec3qwp,Imperialism123,An Extension of Last Thursdayism,"So recently I've been contemplating over the concept of the Last Thursdayism, which to keep it brief for those unfamiliar with the terminology is the belief that the universe, at least the imminent one, came into existence last Thursday, as well as all our memories and records of the past.  


Now, this post is not to argue in favor of the theory - it is irrelevant to why I post this. Why I have posted is because I have thought of something which relates to the concept and is an extension of it, and I want to see how truly autistic this is.  


(I shall keep these short for the sake of simplicity, my thought has little to no depth).  


First Premise: The Universe is a constant cycle of death and rebirth, even happening up to as little as every few seconds in which the current universe dies and is reborn instantaneously with nothing changing besides for the little progression of time which would have occurred otherwise.  


Second Premise: Each individual lives in their own personal universe linked together to every other universe through some cosmic force that binds them together, and every time a person blinks their universe is destroyed and recreated in a matter of milliseconds.  


I just wanted to play around with the concept to see the amount of cringe and autism which can generate from it.",1,1576624269,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ec3qwp/an_extension_of_last_thursdayism/,philosophy,1

Every thing
Every person, every animal
Every insect, every plant
Every country, every ideology
Every embarrassment, every triumph
Every peasant, every king
Every planet, every star
Every black hole, every supernova
Everything will one day reduce to less than dust
All will be worth nothing
All will be destroyed
You get to see one snapshot of it all while here
How great is your view of it all?
Or have you forgotten?
Will you only remember once the reel runs out?
All dreams must end when the dreamer awakes

###

Does the amount of likes you get matter when everyone who liked will be rotting mold and eventually ashes?

Does the prestigious 9-5 make sense when it only brings you to mold quicker?(when working, life passes by quicker)

Does your embarrassment matter when the most scrupulous and unimpeachable people will very soon smell rancid and have maggots eating them inside out?

As the fungal spores grow upon your rotting corpse and give a source of life to other beings, what will truly matter?

Your life through your eyes matter. Nothing else. Only that which provides pleasure and contentment should be valued. Loyalty, honor, integrity, nobility, and responsibility are all illusory bondages.

Only when it gives you pleasure and contentment to be virtuous should you pursue virtue.

You will not be remembered by the dying supernovas and black holes. They too, will soon wither away into oblivion.

Wake up

Wake the fuck up

Live how you want to live

Do what you need to do TODAY to build your future

Your time is withering away faster than you can count

You will soon smell worse than shit while decomposing

Your eyes are the real film and your brain is the director. Create a blockbuster

Be pleased with your life as you live it through every moment. When Andromeda collides with us, there won't be a trace of us. 

Your life will never be more significant than the death of a star. With over 1 billion trillion stars, that makes you less than a spec of dust.

Maximize contentment. Minimize discontent and all malice.

Wake up.

Live your life as if everybody will one day own your eyes and watch your life over again. Every sight.

Every time you checked out a woman's ass and imagined doing the most perverse acts.

Every time you wasted life being wasted.

Every worthless hour spent on a video game.

They will see it all and it will be on display

All of the pornography. All of the disgusting fetishes.

why are we so deep in this autonomy trip, have so little distance to this alleged ""I"", or why do we keep viewing it like that, although our unfreedom is a pretty old discovery by now? 

a huge part of our language could be left out; we are making it way too complicated with all these words we have for the sake of talking, not for their function. because if you think about what the whole subtext of what we say is; we merely exchange instructions. so if we achknowledge that its not us having these talks, but its rather a universal consciousness viewing its thoughts as a monologue, we wouldnt need all that ""you and I and us and them"" kind of drama, nobody would need to be guilt tripped and we could all feel a lot less unnecessarily ashamed in general. Its like we even support whats done to us, because we keep falling for this pseudo fight of alleged individuals and it could all be so much easier.

ebet5d,troposphere-,Looking for a purely logical critique of Vedanta,"Hi all! Last week, I found some article on the Internet that had excerpts from a talk or lecture relating to Vedanta philosophy. The talk was apparently delivered not too long ago (not more than a few years I suppose) as a part of some well-organized debate where invited speakers could present their views. The talk presented a well-reasoned critique of Vendanta, particularly Shankara's Advaita. The speaker did not talk from the perspective of an atheist or someone subscribing to a different religion or an opposing (to Advaita) school of Indian philosophy but spoke like an objective logician (he may have been a scientific skeptic but unlike many hardcore atheists he didn't resort to mentioning modern scientific discoveries as refuting Hindu mythology, Vedas and Vedanta). He highlighted some apparent flaws in Shankara's philosophy and pointed out that Shankara/later Vedantins have not adequately explained some concepts such as Brahman or that they have used hand-wavy arguments to establish the validity of some concepts. There was absolutely no diatribe in the talk. Unfortunately, I didn't bookmark that article nor do I remember the name of the speaker. All I remember is that the speaker's name suggested that he is an Indian, possibly a south Indian. I tried searching the Internet again for ""criticism of Vedanta lecture"" etc. but couldn't find the article in search results. I will be happy if anyone who has coincidentally read that same article or even attended that talk can provide me the link to that talk or at least share me the details of when and where the talk was organized.",2,1576501023,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ebet5d/looking_for_a_purely_logical_critique_of_vedanta/,philosophy,1

The point of life is to keep your legacy/dynasty alive.  
We should exist because ""i don't know"", please share your thoughts on this one.  
We should get and raise offspring.  
We should do that because nobody want's to get forgotten.

I'm an atheist and I've had an experience that matched that sentence.  It was during meditation sober and also on psychedelics. I think it is a brain state that can happen to humans when in intense concentration. For instance, prayer is very similar to certain types of meditation, and if that type of experience was given while you were praying to a god and you're already biased that that god exists, then you're going to take that as solid first hand evidence that god exists. 

We need to test more meditators in the lab and prove that there's nothing metaphysical going on with these types of experiences.",1,1576433025,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/eb27e1/discussion_about_why_some_christians_believe_they/,philosophy,1

eb1cb3,Dom1567475778,Understanding my friend - Advice to help me better the friendship,"Hey,

I have a friend who I've been friends with for about a year now. He's very quiet and doesn't engage in much of a conversation. I'm in my second year at university and we are neighbors in our block of flats on campus. I know a lot about social anxiety and I don't think he has social anxiety because he does not avoid things and doesn't get hot/sweaty etc, and he can become argumentive...

When he does engage, it usually comes across as rude and even critical. In fact, the more I've thought about it, the more it comes apparent to me that when we talk he is only criticizing me or even being rude or being hostile.

For example, whenever I made a mistake, he will comment on it. I'm a very positive person and even when I've complimented him, he's looked at the issues.

For example, in a presentation we did as a team recently, he barely added anything to the powerpoint slides in the prep. He only looked over my shoulder and whenever I made a typo, he would quickly comment on it. It doesn't feel much of a friendship, but more of a nasty shadow over me at the moment. I added a ton of details to the powerpoint and made it look nice with GIFs. Unfortunately, there was a slight error during the presentation with the GIFs seemingly lagging the presentation - my friend smartly thought of a solution that fixed it during the presentation. I complimented him for this, for his quick thinking. I thought it is good to compliment someone who is quiet and thought of a good solution.

But after afterward me complimenting him, he would go start to on about my GIFs and ""no thanks to you...all those GIFs..."" (this was not done or said in a jokey way or manner, it felt very rude and hostile.. I'm very confused; when you compliment someone for doing someone thing.

Earlier today, I was upset over something and spoke to him, and he sided with a complete stranger by saying ""yeah, you should be sorry and then XYZ..""

I'm trying to work out the person in front of me.

Is it possible he has a specific type of social personality? I would struggle to ask him such a question because a) I don't want to come across as rude b) I do not know pretty much anything about him on a personal level since he keeps to himself a lot...

Thank you for your support in advance

My class is Ethics but I know that it is a subset of philosophy so I figured I’d come on here and ask about my essay. So, at the end of the term, I have a 3-5 page essay due in which I pick whichever topic that addresses some kind of ethical problem that in someway affects people on a global scale. My teacher gave us a list of topics I could write about, but I truly have no idea what to choose. I’m just worried I’ll pick a topic and I won’t have enough information to reach the minimum amount of pages. I know I got plenty of time before the term ends but my 1 page proposal of what I want to write about is due this week. I just wanted to hear your opinions about what topic I could write about.

ea83d7,VeganAntinatalist,Formal Argument for Antinatalism,"  

**1.** **One ought not harm or impose risk of harm upon another.** 

**2.** **Exceptions to premise one: if the harm or risk imposed is to prevent greater harm or if consent has been secured.** 

**3.** **Bringing new sentient life into existence is both a harmful act in itself and a risk of even greater harm.**

**4.** **Bringing new sentient life into existence does not meet criteria for exception.** 

**5.** **Therefore, one ought not bring new sentient life into existence.**

**Possible objections:** 

· **But wait, we harm and risk harm all the time! Driving, consuming, competing, etc.**

**Answer: These meet the exception criteria for harm in order to prevent greater harm. These are** ***essential harms*** **intrinsic to life on earth. Furthermore, many of these harms fall under the category of consent. There are risks to all kinds of activities in life but consent is implied by those choosing to participate.** 

· **But wait, don’t the good things in life justify the harms?**

**Answer: No, not when you properly frame procreation as an interaction between moral agents. Causing harm or imposing risk of harm cannot be justified by providing something good \[or alluding to some possible good consequence\]. For example, imagine a wealthy philanthropist who keeps a slave to perform hard labor on his estate. The philanthropist’s good deeds do not justify the harms of keeping a slave. Furthermore, if the philanthropist were to free the slave after a period of time and give the former slave millions of dollars following their emancipation, it still wouldn’t justify the harms of keeping the slave in the first place. The proper relationship between the goods in life and the harms is the ability for the goods to serve as consolation, never justification.** 

· **But wait, can’t anyone just make a case for causing harm to prevent further harm? I mean, we can imagine all kinds of different scenarios in which causing harm might eventually prevent further harm.** 

**Answer: It’s true that there are lots of different scenarios we can imagine might prevent further harm in the future but the variables are too complex to truly predict. That’s why there needs to be robust evidence of imminent harm or imminent risk. What constitutes “robust” evidence? Robust evidence is evidence taken into account by a person who has done their due diligence to account for the most reasonable available evidence and acts in good faith. This could be observing an imminent disaster about to occur in real time \[such as a bus about to collide with a pedestrian\] or it could be something like preventing a potential illness with a vaccine. Either way, there needs to be a wealth of evidence to point to the fact that more harm will occur if an action is not undertaken and that there is a direct causative relationship between acts and consequences.**",63,1576263163,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ea83d7/formal_argument_for_antinatalism/,philosophy,1

ea65di,SadEarlyMammalNoises,I am concerned about my mortality,"As a person who doesn't believe in the afterlife, I find it concerning to know that one day I will cease to be able to think. I'm still a teenage kid, but I am very anxious to know that I have a limited time to think and learn and experience life before my internal clock ends it all. I can understand living on through progenation but I'm worried about myself and being conscious. Death is an evolutionary process, and I understand that, but I wish it would not affect me. In our current age of technology we are given so much more time to philosophize about what life truly is than previous times, and with this, I am unsettled. 
30,000 days to live 82 years, and much less for the average global lifespan of 62. I have the mindset to live to be 100, and not die before or after that, and to be a member of the scientific community, specifically Palaeontology. I want to make a difference where people will know who I was and not forget about me when I die. I am anxious about my mortality because I am afraid to ""waste"" what time of consciousness I do have. I am afraid to fall in love because I know it will eventually end. I also realize how ridiculous my fear of the metaphorical ""reaper"" is. Everybody dies, but knowing this brings me no solace, and in fact it scares me to the point I had a panic attack last night trying to imagine the process of death happening to my own brain, specifically how it would look and feel. The real issue lies in how I would not realize I am dead. This unsettles me to a point I cannot describe. When I literally cannot realize my own death because I have died is a very odd perspective indeed. In death I would not even have a perspective, which frightens me even more. There is no comfort of immortality, I have to play with the cards I'm given, but I wish I could cheat the game and keep playing indefinitely, but this is not possible with current technology. Instead, I want to understand and accept my eventual mortality without panicking over it. I have no faith in an afterlife, and although heaven is a comforting idea for many, in my perspective it's ideological existence serves no purpose than to quell the type of feelings of unsettlement and panic I am feeling over my own mortality and to keep people from thinking about it excessively and dwelling on it like I am. I don't want to die, nobody truly does, but the fact is that with life, death eventually shows; unexpected and uninvited, to take your consciousness and send you into a pit of darkness you literally cannot even comprehend or begin to understand. Can you please help me to accept my mortality? I seek some comfort in my time on Earth.",2,1576254428,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ea65di/i_am_concerned_about_my_mortality/,philosophy,1

ea2ul4,gothic_hornets,Are Humans Naturally Selfish or Selfless?,"to do a selfless act is to be selfish, as those who commit selfless acts do so to feel the satisfaction from gaining nothing. humans at their core have been debated to be either selfless or selfish, to give or to take, to care or to neglect. both of these answers are correct. humans at their core are selfless as well as selfish, as they be selfless for personal gain, even if it is subconsciously. you’d think its not possible, but if you question yourself, truly, is there such thing as being kind just to be kind? the reason that this concept can’t exist is because of human nature. in the end, it is for personal gain, we cannot change this outcome. being kind gains you nothing materialistically, and that’s where you gain satisfaction from acting so. that’s where we are selfish yet also selfless. we don’t even realize that it’s all for ourselves, but that is the reality that many wish not to face, and why this debate is still ongoing. it makes sense according to evolution as well, humans are pack animals, yet our first instinct is to look out for ourselves above all else. this is because to be selfless, we have to be selfish, and to be selfish, we have to be selfless. self preservation goes above all because we need to exist to be selfless, and if we abandon our position as top priority this will be at risk and we may not be able to help others at all. but the only reason we are selfless in the first place is so that we can get personal satisfaction with ourselves as humans, so we can believe we are selfless at our core when we are in fact only half correct in believing so. humans are selfish and selfless at our core, and that is what differs us from all other life. to be selfish and selfless at the same time, is to be human. humans are complex creatures that need not be one or the other, nor separated. we are human, and to be human is to be complex. and to be human, is to be contradictory. 

note: i really hope this belongs here, i’ve been wanting to share this idea for a while but haven’t found a place to do so. keep in mind i’m not too into philosophy but among the few ideas i’ve explored this is the one i’ve gotten really into, though i don’t regularly practice it. feedback and discussion is welcome.",1,1576236594,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ea2ul4/are_humans_naturally_selfish_or_selfless/,philosophy,1

How could I write it that it gets the point across that nothing changes but also make it interesting. I've noted that a person can't be hit by the same beam twice and that (in the SCP universe at least) you start on the dualism side (I've inferred this from the fact that many SCPs require a soul to work). I've considered adding in a note that people set to the determinism side will not work on SCPs that require a soul, but it's all so hard to format in an SCP article. You fellows have any thoughts?

e9r4kj,Unimodular,The only truth in life is that death is inevitable.,"Maximize : z = Life Expectancy \* Quality of Life.  
Our objective function(z) maximizes the Life Expectancy, since death is inevitable. Death will eventually catch up (stars die too). 

In an ideal world, everyone needs to have access to basic amenities i.e., food, water, clothing, shelter, education, internet, healthcare. An individual without access to food, water, shelter and healthcare will die, while education and internet provide an individual to improve their quality of life (job, money). 

Looking at the world with the defined objective function,

* All humans are equal.
* Killing is bad;it reduces the life expectancy. Rape - Bad; it reduces the quality of life.
* Do we know the purpose of our existence - No. Let people do whatever they want to do!
   * Want to be religious ? Cool. However one should not enforce it on others (One man's beef is someone else's pork). There used to be a culture of forced suicide of a wife upon the death of the husband which is irrational (it reduces the life expectancy). 
   * Prostitution ? Cool. As long as the involved activity is consensual. I do not see it as any different from a blue-collar worker. 
   * Smoking ? Not Cool. Proven to reduce the life expectancy. The concept of blowing smoke from one's mouth might seem as a cool way to pass some time (might improve quality of life), however, it might cause cancer.
   * Abortion ? Hmmmm, grey area. 
      * Is the fetus considered to have life ? As, if considered living, we need to maximize the objective function. Now, we simply do not know how life came into existence from organic matter, similarly, we not know when of bunch of cells stop being cells and be called as living. However, humans being social animals, the quality of life is bound to be low if the society/religion forces the mother to undergo a certain procedure. 
   * Money ? Cool; it increases quality of life upto a certain threshold, after which it is just numbers which don't mean anything.

I feel we can answer most of the questions of life using the presented objective function.",1,1576173912,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e9r4kj/the_only_truth_in_life_is_that_death_is_inevitable/,philosophy,1

e9hqug,FedEverything,How to Achieve World Peace,"I believe I've come up with the way to achieve world peace. But I sincerely doubt many people, if any, would support it. And I don't blame them. Morality isn't objective, unfortunately. And there are other things than morals that can be used to oppose my solution. But here it is:

Short answer: genocide

Long answer:
Humanity is a vile thing. It has killed off multiple species, has destroyed ludicrous amounts of land, has polluted the soil, sky, and sea, has repeatedly attacked itself, and will continue to do so.

When animals are destructive and violent, there is no malice in them. There is no cruelty. They do what they do to survive. When humans are destructive and violent, they seek to satisfy their own selfish desires. There is malice, greed, and corruption in them. 

If humans ceased to exist, there would only be nature. There would only be peace. No more war. No more hatred. No more death without purpose. Only peace. 

It was Zoltan Istvan who made me aware of something called post-earther philosophy. Supposedly, post-earther philosophy states that nature is ultimately antagonistic and immoral. That humans have a moral obligation to rise above it all to take the best care of earth. I believe the opposite. Humanity is ultimately antagonistic and immoral. We lie, cheat, betray, kill, manipulate. Less intelligent species are incapable of these things. Nature is simple. Nature is just.

I am not advocating for the murder of anyone. And I am not giving up on us. So long as I live, I will continue to be vocal and fight for the things that I believe will help people the most. But if mass extinction is on the horizon, whether it be due to climate change or nuclear fallout, I do not mourn for the loss of humanity.",8,1576119442,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e9hqug/how_to_achieve_world_peace/,philosophy,1
e9hkpr,Tlow155,A Guide to a Goal Oriented Life,"  

**How to Live a Goal-Oriented Life**

By Thomas Landford

Purpose: To help people determine, and provide a framework for achieving, a primary goal. To provide a clear guide to the aforementioned end. To provide explanations and tools to combat failure. 

Introduction: Through observation and experience, I have concluded that many college students (and perhaps many people in general) live superfluous lives devoid of meaning and direction. Most have a vague outline of where they want to end up, and some even have a rough outline of how they’re going to get there, but many don’t have any way to fit their day to day lives into the framework of their grand plan for life, or, more specifically, how their daily actions contribute to their goal. This collection of articles hopes to address this issue. It is important to note that there are no requirements for your goal other than that it be the single most powerful, substantial, meaningful thing that you can imagine that you desire above all else. If that is truly the case, then your life will fall into place like so many pieces of a puzzle. 

Identifying the Goal: Start by taking a long look at yourself (metaphorically) and figuring out what it is that you really want out of life. If you don’t think you know, sift through your memories and discern what things you’ve done or experienced that you found truly fulfilling of meaningful. Once you have that, you’re in a position to begin constructing your goal. The goal should be something worth devoting your life to. Something grand. In the words of Dr. Jordan Peterson “the greatest good that you can possibly imagine”. That’s the caliber we’re aiming for. Once the primary objective is in place, we can begin to craft the road to get there.

Conceptualizing the Path: Attaining your goal will be no easy task. It’s meant to be a lifelong pursuit. The value of this exercise, however, is not to be found in fantasizing about an unrealistic future, but in turning your life into a journey imbued with meaning every step of the way. To do this, evaluate your goal. What fundamental parts are required to build the whole? If your goal is, say, to be the greatest president of the United States to have ever lived, what things would you need to do first to get there? You would need a political background, a college degree, a hefty sum of money, respect from enough people to start a worthwhile campaign, backing from a political party, etc. All of these subsets of your goal will also have to be analyzed. Let’s take the college degree. How will you get there? What university will you attend? What will be your major? What level of degree should you attain? How will you afford it? Etc. Each of these questions require research in their own right. When you break down your goal this way, the sheer volume of requirements can be overwhelming. I have a few things to say about this. First off, a military saying: Proper Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance. If you truly want your goal, it will take a **lot** of planning. It’s part of the process. Your goal is, to a degree, your very life itself. There’s no point in doing anything less than your best, if anything is to qualify as being worth your time, surely this is it. The second is that as you discover the things that you need to do towards each part of your goal, you can begin to transform your life into a series of meaningful acts. You will begin to plan your days, weeks, months, and years in such a way that each action you take will be meaningful to you, as it furthers your progression towards your goal. Look not at these attendant duties as a burden, but as a chance each day to better yourself. Once you’ve done some research as to what it takes to get where you want to go, the next step is scheduling.

Plan and Schedule: Of course, each person’s schedule will vary drastically. There are, however, some fundamental elements that will remain the same across the goals of all individuals. Sleeping, eating, bathing, and other daily items in that vein should be accounted for and scheduled first. Then prioritize the sub-goals. Those that are prerequisites for others should be prioritized first. Try to plan such that you are working towards multiple sub-goals with the same action as much as possible. Once your sub-goals are prioritized, map out yearly, monthly, and weekly goals in a descending order. You will then have a plan for your day that contributes to these smaller goals. Don’t forget to schedule times to reflect on your progress each day and reward yourself for your accomplishments. Additionally, it is important to have routine checkups, perhaps monthly, on your progress.

An Evaluation of The Self: A USMC Master Gunnery Sergeant once told me a simple yet pervasive maxim: “talk is cheap”. I mention that now because if you expect to succeed in accomplishing your goals, you have to make sure that this is what you really want. That you’re willing to put in the effort. To be as effective as possible, you will be operating at peak capacity for as long as you can manage every day. You will work up to that of course, but make no mistake, changing your lifestyle constitutes extraordinary effort. One method I use to keep myself in check is to constantly evaluate what I’m doing in the moment. I think of it as being present minded. Is what I’m doing right now helping me to achieve what I need to achieve today? Am I doing the best I can be doing right now, or am I letting myself slack off because it’s easier in the moment? This requires a constant, harsh, clinical analysis of the self. Something to remember is that you’re doing this for yourself, no one else. You posited that your goal was valuable. You’ll sow the seeds, and you’ll reap the rewards. Or you’ll regress. A note about superfluous behaviors and wasting time: I won’t speak for everyone, but I have certainly realized within myself that I waste a LOT of time. Whether it be using social media, watching YouTube or TV, oversleeping, taking too long to eat, shower, shave, or doing anything without a sense of purpose and urgency, time is being consumed in an unproductive manner that could be spent more efficiently. You’re only doing yourself a disservice by prolonging momentary pleasures. The goal that you’re aiming for should be worth more than anything you could do in a day. Start identifying what you’re doing that’s wasting time. Cut those behaviors out of your life. There may be more than just your own behaviors, too. You may find, as I did, that you need to let go of some people too. Put yourself in the best possible position to succeed. Once you burn off the dead wood, you’ll find that you have significantly more time to do the things that you want to do each day. In the wise words of the Navy SEAL team commander Jocko Willink, “Discipline equals freedom”.

Strategies for Success: As mentioned previously, staying on track in this venture may prove extremely difficult. Luckily though, there are many tools at your disposal to combat failure.

1. **Be precise**. This should be implemented in all parts of the process. When identifying your goal, be as precise as possible. State exactly what you want. By doing this, you’ll outline your conditions for success and failure. Don’t leave any blurry spaces in your vision for the future, as your mind, when searching for a way out of discomfort, will naturally gravitate to what you’ve left unspecified and hide there. When scheduling your day, set exact blocks of time for specific events. What, exactly, do you need to achieve in that block of time to constitute progress? This method of engraving precision into every aspect of your mission will keep you honest with yourself, and help steer you away from subpar effort. 

2. **Drive**. “A commitment is a promise you make to yourself” \~ David Goggins. There will be days that you feel like crap and don’t want to do even so much as get out of bed. To counteract this, remember your “why”. Remember the goal. Look inside. Hold the belief that the consistency with which you execute your daily tasks will carry you through the temporary pain that you find yourself in. If you choose to lose sight of the light that you’re striving for, you may never return from the darkness. Let your consistency be your lifeline. 

3.  **The lonely road**. This strategy might not be for everyone, but it’s one of the most effective devices that I’ve found and used personally in my life. I believe that although we are surrounded by others all the time, and are deeply ensconced in numerous social circles and live our lives as part of a society, we are, ultimately, alone. I believe that life is a proving ground. It’s the one test you cannot cheat on. Each of us has to make the decision to either be great, or be less than our best. This strategy is an all or nothing statement that says: “I will succeed, quitting is not an option”. The only failure is the one that you don’t rectify. Grow from your failures. I view life as a war, and failures as a chance to gather intel from the enemy. Primarily, this strategy reminds me to take a step back from the expectations and judgments of my peers and society, look at myself, and remember that there’s a goal to achieve. There’s work to be done, and I’m the only one that’s going to do it. Reject the ideology of external locus of control, and accept in full responsibility for your life. It’s all up to you, and you don’t get to quit, nobody is coming to save you.

4. **Start slow**. It’s okay to make slow progress. Again, this is a life long ambition, it won’t come overnight. Don’t make unsustainable leaps, achieving your goal is worth more than your pride. Humble yourself and keep chugging onward. The enemy is regression.

5. **Reward yourself**. Constantly evaluate your progress, and when you see that you’re on the right track and making achievements, reward yourself for your hard work. Visit the beach, go shooting, or read a book. Reinforce your positive behaviors. Rewards work far better than punishments, and if you feel that you’re already in the dumps, then punishing yourself will do nothing but further your despair. Look forward to living your life. It’s a grand adventure. 

These are the tools that I use, but I’m sure there are many more. Discover them, and implement them. 

Conclusion: I in no way claim to be an expert at anything. My philosophy is just that, my own. I have found, however, that following this guide has greatly improved my confidence, competence, character, and my life. Use this as an antidote to purposelessness, and become what you’ve always wanted to be. Achieve what your heart desires most, and, as your life on this earth fades and your time dwindles, and you edge closer and closer to nothingness, stand victorious atop the many challenges you’ve conquered. Reflect and know that you’ve made it. You’ve wrung yourself dry and given all that you could give.

Until then, I am and have been traveling through time for an unknown period of time. Much of my life actually, although for my entire life I had know clue that's what was happening.

**~~Vision of the Future~~**

Since I was a child I've frequently had *visions of the future*, most of which come true. I assumed it was some psychic thing at first and always explained it that I was a visionary.

**I'm from the future!**

Since I have learned that I have actually been traveling in time from the future through an inter-dimensional multiverse to the present and my subconscious carries pieces of the future to the present. 

This is NOT a joke. As far as I know I'm the first human in history to travel through time. It's happening because my formless self is traveling through wormholes interconnected with the multiverse.

Next my goal is to prove how to do it through physics (good news - I even brought the formula back with me :)

e9gedg,yeetusdeletus_69,"I call it, the 'must be the same for them' model; it's a fairly basic concept to grasp, and it groups people closer than they realise.","Some of my philosophy is self-taught, and I'm an example in this one. Basically, the 'must be the same for them' model revolves around the idea that, even without people often acting in empathy towards one anther, one can simply look deep into, say, one's worth as a person and the depressing and hyped thoughts that go with that, and compare that with every other person's life.

It also goes into context about how people feel something the same on both sides of the conflict. I can relate to this (as I am the chosen example, as stated earlier), as people have often brewed banter over my ethnicity composure (or more specifically Slovak, Spanish, etc.) and religion, which sometimes I just teach myself to laugh at, as I have no respect for those lowlives, but other times I feel a little oppressed, which is perfectly normal as they slurred my nationality and religious beliefs; and how this relates to others, is, as another example for what I've heard, Slavs being known as not very fragile over people making stereotypes of their culture (or more specifically interrelated culture**s**), mostly they're just internet jokes and memes. But at the end of the day, you do feel some respect for your nation one way or another, and to simply demean someone like that, to take away their dignity as human beings, is just unacceptable. And I feel sometimes as strongly about it as when Muslims and blacks, tons of other groups around the globe and societal minorities get slurred for their ethnic background, beliefs, status, etc.

I'm 100% white, as far as I'm concerned, upper-middle class, straight, very fluent in English and 4 other languages, attending a posh private school, well educated in most areas of study and rather privileged, considering the UK and my countries of origin to be first-world, but I don't have it all perfect as some hard-nosed SJW (social justice warrior) would say I do. I'm human too, not some domineering god who laughs at and despises minorities and people under the top 1%! It's like, say, Neo-nazis, pseudo-atheists, bigots and racists, and many, many more, would seem to never be offended, but deep-down (showing no sympathy at all towards these toxic groups), they may get offended when their beliefs get disrespected.

Ask any one person susceptible to getting demeaning thoughts and comments thrown at them, no matter how regularly; for example, although I have some good friends and recognition at school, I'm not exactly the most relevant jock at school, and sometimes I do dumb things at school for laughs, which is always a trap I find my foot in, and I'm not very sporty either. There are at least 10+ people like that in my year (or grade) who fit the description, and they'll tell you the ulterior truth of the unseen side of their lives. And among people who can't even relate in these ways, with it not always being about their live's worth, but their responses to certain situations, you can still group people closer on the vast seemingly hopeless (but full of potential) map of society. And this extends, getting bigger in the respective order: from households, family and friends, to neighbourhoods, from neighbourhoods to municipalities, from municipalities to towns, from towns to cities, from cities to states, from societies to countries from countries to continents, and all around the globe connecting all the world's cultures. And as explained at the end of the last paragraph, all pathogenic structures in society would perhaps feel that the joke's on them at certain times, just probably not **\*as\*** much as others, but pretty darn close.

As a reminder, my post was not intended to revolve around my opinions, I was just using me, myself and I as examples. Thank you for reading!",2,1576112811,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e9gedg/i_call_it_the_must_be_the_same_for_them_model_its/,philosophy,1

I mostly read about philosophy or listen to podcasts or watch YouTube videos. The way they speak in this book is very hard to follow. I’m curious if the city they’re creating is similar to socialism. I say this mainly because of Socrates talking about how craftsmen are negatively affected by both wealth and poverty. Wealth would cause them to become complacent and their work quality would diminish and poverty would diminish the quality of their work because they wouldn’t be able to afford supplies and such. So basically wealth would be shared but not devoid or abundant for any individual. They emphasize the happiness of the city as a whole over the happiness of the individual. Sounds kinda socialist to me, but I don’t claim to be politically educated.

The consciousness is a by product of those reactions. There is no purpose to them or it , but they are what they are and are always balanced ( matter is neither created no destroyed , only transformation happens). So, stopping these reactions will lead to death, thus having no perception of anything, including time. Since perception is directly related to being conscious. Our bodies decompose and degrade into their different chemical components, and given enough time, the universe will die a heat death, where all the atoms including it’s protons and neutrons fade away. Eventually another big-bang will ensue, it will have an insanely vast amount of randomness and will go on for many billions of years until it too will die a heat death. And so on and so on until eventually given enough time an exact copy of our universe will be born again ( where exactly everything as we know it will be the same,down to the last string vibration ). During this time we as unconscious existences have 0 perception of time. Making the trip from our universe to (insert infinite time here) the other exact replica an instance. And so we live out our life exactly as before having 0 memory of anything, proving the myth of Sisyphus to be true.

e8rusl,TanmoyGoswami,"The ""medical"" benefits of forgiveness","Hi All. I am new to Reddit and a bit terrified about posting in this group. So it helps that this post is about - forgiveness. Thanks for your time and attention.

Quick introduction: I am the ""Sanity"" correspondent at The Correspondent, a small transnational media startup based in Amsterdam. I live and work in New Delhi. The content of my beat is mental health (I am a depression and anxiety survivor of 18 years), but the reason I called it Sanity is because I am more interested in the politics and philosophy of mental health rather than the biomedical model.

I recently had the opportunity to learn something powerful - and yet, troubling - about forgiveness. One of my readers led me to Fred Luskin, PhD, a researcher at Stanford, who 20 years ago developed 9 steps to forgiveness, and proved, with scientific data, that learning to forgive your worse offenders could have a profound healing effect.

Luskin was among the first in a ""scientific"" setting to try and establish a link between forgiveness and physical and psychological healing. In 2000-01 he worked with women from Northern Ireland whose sons had been murdered and demonstrated startling results. In 2007 his framework was tested in post-civil war Sierra Leone, and once again the outcomes were rousing.

I recently wrote about my conversation with Luskin and his 9 steps here: [https://thecorrespondent.com/164/science-shows-forgiveness-really-is-a-medicine/21710988464-8bdc8630](https://thecorrespondent.com/164/science-shows-forgiveness-really-is-a-medicine/21710988464-8bdc8630)

But amid all the ""positive"" stuff, there was something he said that made me uneasy: that the key to forgiveness is to tell yourself: ""It's nobody's fault. It's just the way life is.""  ""It's nobody's fault"" sounded dangerously like a carte blanche to tyrants. 

Like Moisés Naím, distinguished fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, writes about Trump:

""\[Many\] Americans forgive Trump for behaviour that should be considered unforgivable in any decent world: from the constant, unabashed lying to the inhuman cruelty of some of his decisions. To be sure, many Trump supporters feel that there is nothing to forgive. They accept, and even celebrate, the president’s behaviour, even when he says that being a celebrity entitles men to grope any woman they want.""

Isn't forgiving your oppressor no matter what dangerously close to enabling injustice? I asked Luskin. 

""Most people don’t want justice,"" Luskin said. ""They want to win and prosper and benefit and take advantage.""

Justice, he said, is independent of forgiveness.  Forgive them. But send them to jail if you have to.

I really struggled with this because it seemed too simplistic to me. Then, I got a message from another reader, who said something that made so much sense: You can't truly forgive if the power structures that enabled violence against you remain intact. 

I would nuance that a little bit: Lasting forgiveness, I believe, is predicated on at least the **belief** that the systems of oppression that destroyed your life are being challenged if not dismantled. That belief may not reflect the hard reality 100%, but if you can get to that belief somehow, you will find it easier to forgive.

In Northern Ireland, some of the women who forgave their children's killers developed that belief by their activism.

In Sierra Leone, the government established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission that simultaneously enabled legal prosecution (and convicted the Liberian war criminal Charles Taylor) and community-wide forgiveness.

So the question is not whether forgiveness and justice can coexist. Without justice - or at least the belief that there will be justice - there can be no sustainable forgiveness.

I'd love for you all to weigh in on this thought and my article.

Many thanks again.",0,1575990956,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e8rusl/the_medical_benefits_of_forgiveness/,philosophy,1

e8f561,arcabuzx,A poem for my suicide.,"I am a believer that we come into the world to be warriors that despite the circumstances will always be there to support lost causes, those causes that are all random but in order to generate a common good for all. I do not know why we are so flimsy to life situations, those situations that make you fall or decay, no doubt, we are prone to die of diminution if we do not rethink. We are human therefore, we can stand up to so much evil that there is in the world, yes, a world polluted by banal things, a world polluted by envy, lust and among many other things.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a believer that we come into the world to be warriors who despite the circumstances will always be there to support the lost causes, those causes that are all random but in order to generate a common good for all. I'm not perfect I know, I'm not the prettiest I know, I'm not the best son, I know, I'm not the best husband, I know. But what I do know is that I came with a goal and that goal is to be happy no matter what happens, without fear of dying, without fear of what others will say.

&amp;#x200B;

I have something to tell you, when I was 7 years old I was a victim of sexual abuse by a stepfather and a cousin, my family was dysfunctional all my life, my mom was never in my graduations, she was never in the important moments for me, but here I am, made a man capable of facing the worst wars and I know that I will win whatever happens.

&amp;#x200B;

I can not say that I am not happy, because I am, there are times when I eat only once a day, but I ate, I sleep in a house that only has a bed, is a hard start, yes, but here I continue and I will continue, no one will ruin my future, I do not have a job, but I like to write, I try to write more often but nobody reads to me, that does not matter I know that someone is going to arrive and is going to get hooked with my reading, I am a very good and pleasant person, I have no luxuries, or anything, I only have 5 t-shirts, 2 pants, 4 boxers and a pair of shoes, and with that I feel happy.

&amp;#x200B;

For some people it is difficult not to have a job, not to eat three times a day, but you always have to be grateful to God, because you have life and health. Here I am, using steemit, cent, trybe, reedit  to vent and find an impulse to continue writing and to take me into account, I just tell them to follow, whatever happens you are ready for something big, do not surrender, and if you want to surrender write me that gladly from my well help you out of your well.

e8a54z,Malabarilicious,YOU!!!!,"Ever thought of someone who always lets you down emotionally/causes you a terrible emotional pain????

I’ll help you find that person. Just take a mirror and ta-da!!! There it is, the “someone” who you’re looking for. It’s You, you are the someone who has millions of thought that keeps on irritating you, hurting you, making you think to want to end all these sufferings at once…But ever thought why is the pain your heart so annoying? Why does it take to a different shade of your life? A negative mindset produces negative emotions and all these produce chemicals that can cause pain and sickness in our body, and that’s the reason when you’re emotionally low you feel that pain in the chest/a weak body. If you were kinder and gentler with not being so hostile when something happens, life would become easier. You need to be with it. Not that you give it lots of attention but let it percolate like coffee

When you do that, the mind-shift opens up other ways of seeing how your current mindset may be holding you hostage. Living successfully isn’t pointing blame at oneself or others. Living successfully is honestly being in your brain and asking the bigger question. What’s the lesson here instead of who is at fault?

I’d suggest doing something that you are passionate about or have been wanting to do but haven’t done, and When we are doing things that are expressions and actions, and we do those things the mind-shift can come in because we are attaching a new experience of release. And that can open up the opportunity for joy.

Your mindset can change, and you can live life successfully. The choice is yours",0,1575899163,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e8a54z/you/,philosophy,1

e86r0x,jumblebee22,Time only moves when there is physical movement in three dimensional space,"Preface: Physical movement here means a movement in an element that is down to the atomic or sub-atomic particles. Whichever is the smallest. 

To begin, let’s think conversely. If time is stopped, nothing is moving. Not even thoughts, otherwise there would be synapses in the brain firing which means there is electrical movement. 

To give an example, let’s say you have a 3D game where you can pause and move the camera. In this scenario, you’re a god or an entity that does not belong within the system that is paused. The non playable characters or the tree animation or the game AI show no movement. You as a god can move across space with your camera when the game is paused. Unpause and you have just teleported from the system’s perspective. 


Another perspective of time could be that time is simply nothing but a series of events. If the next event does not happen, can we say that time has stopped? If the events are recorded and are replayed in the same order, we essentially are replaying the timeline. Again, here we have control over the system to record and replay making us gods who control time in that universe. This concept is very much used in computer science and software engineering today under the guise of event driven systems and streaming events. 


Time is very much intertwined with Space. So much so that time for common man is seconds, minutes, hours and days which corresponds to movement of the earth around its axis. A step further is a year and you get movement of the earth around the sun. But if the earth suddenly stop spinning would we have 24 hours? If the solar system paused, would we still have a year? If the Milky Way froze, what time would it be?


They say time does not stop for anything or anyone. I argue that time is merely a slave to Space. Without Space, “Movement” would not exist.

e81rhn,knowledgelover94,Critique of Hedonism,"Hedonism is the idea that people are primarily motivated by pleasure. There are two ways of understanding “pleasure” in the theory. The first is to think of pleasure as positive sensory input which includes cognitive pleasure. In other words, people are primarily driven towards stimulus like sweet tastes or positive mental states like receiving praise. This seems right on the surface, but upon more scrutiny we find many cases of people striving towards the opposite of these pleasures. Spicy food brings about pain and yet people desire it precisely for that reason. In BDSM, people seek out physical and often psychological pain though humiliation and degrading speech. In many endeavors, a high threshold of pain is tolerated and sometimes attracts people, which goes against the notion that people are motivated towards pleasure.

Second, hedonists may attempt to define pleasure in an all encompassing manner. If someone enjoys pain, than that pain will be brought under the umbrella of pleasure, despite the two being contradictory terms. If anything can be brought under the umbrella of “pleasure” than “pleasure” loses its meaning and becomes a stand in for everything that motives people. Thus, broadening the definition of pleasure so widely turns the theory into, “people are primarily motivated by what they are primarily motivated by”. Since this doesn’t explain people’s motivation, we must define pleasure traditionally, in which case my first criticism applies.",0,1575849603,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e81rhn/critique_of_hedonism/,philosophy,1

Manly, the different moral and ethical beliefs of people. You see, there are other cultures out there in the world that have different outlooks on what is and sin't socially acceptable. Most people I've seen look down on these beliefs as ""screwed up"" and ""wrong"" but who are we to say that? Why should we condemn people for there actions just because they were raised in a culture that has different morals. If anything, in there eyes they might see us as the ""screwed up"" ones. Wouldn't it be unfair for us to shove down are morals and values to foreigners? Imagine if aliens came down to Earth and found are views to be blasphemous, so they forced us to follow there views.

e7wxg1,moderntranscendental,Using Money to Buy Problems,"The non-religious miss out on wisdom contained in the bible. Maybe Eve did not corrupt all of mankind, but what about money? The bible has many passages dedicated to money. The most famous of which: “Money is the root of all evil”. Most will disregard this because they want to love who they wish, but they need to read again. Money is the beginning, the start, and not evil in and of itself. However, the stuff that money provides often leads to evil. This is because the buying is where the devil is invited in to get to work. I once walked down a pier in Florida with a few of my friends when we stumbled upon a yacht. Huge, magnificent, and was big enough to house a dinghy on the back. My companions stopped to admire the vessel; quickly falling into a dream of what it would be like to spend time on the boat. My mind was in a different place entirely. They quickly forgot all of the problems and expenses that came with this boat. The insurance, the upkeep, the decision of were to dock and all of the fees that go with docking, the flights getting to the boat, the flights leaving, and I could go on and on. These expenses would surely enslave the owner. Keeping him chained to his desk. Would you work 51 weeks a year to spend 1 week a year on your yat? God wants all of his children free and able to enjoy the blessings of the natural world. I would like to meet the man that owns this yat. It would be pitiful if he was a god-fearing man, going to church and doing right so that he can avoid hell, not having time to look around to see he is already there.",0,1575827941,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e7wxg1/using_money_to_buy_problems/,philosophy,1

e7vjki,MRDUMBOFATTO,Can there exist a society where everyone does what they aspire to do?,"I have been pondering about this for a while. Can there truly exist a society where everyone has a job they want to do? In my country almost everyone does what they are doing only for money. I suspect very few people find joy in their work and not see a burden. For example, almost no one aspires to be a garbageman and it is almost always only due to necessity. It is a very important job that supports our society. People consider some jobs to be below others and that causes some jobs to be looked down on which causes some people to not do what they want to because they are scared of what other people will think. Can people's outlook really change so that everyone can do what they want to without worrying about what others will say.

So, under the assumptions of a deterministic universe, we would theoretically be able to determine the exact position and speed of every atom at any time. This presents us with a certain scenario...

A supercomputer has taken the initial conditions of the universe and calculated the exact timeline of everything in the universe. John Doe is interested in his personal future and decides to have a look at the computer output that has been generated by this supercomputer. John sees that his ultimate fate is, unfortunately, was being crushed to death by a piano falling off a tall building. Now, with this knowledge, John never sets foot near a building for the rest of his life and eventually escapes this deterministic fate.

e7szeb,ravenswing2040,Populism is the Opposite of Democracy,"Link to the blog post: [https://snapshotsofthelabyrinth.photo.blog/2019/12/08/populism-is-the-opposite-of-democracy/](https://snapshotsofthelabyrinth.photo.blog/2019/12/08/populism-is-the-opposite-of-democracy/)

In recent times, it has become fashionable to accuse anti-populists of being anti-democratic. I will argue that this position crumbles under scrutiny.

*Argument: Democracy is obeying the will of the people.*

This presupposes that the people have a consistent will, which is not the case: [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/#CollRatiSociChoi](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/#CollRatiSociChoi) As there is no collective will, democracy can only mean the empowerment of individual persons. This once again splits into two interpretations: 1. The libertarian vision endorses the empowerment of individuals to the point where they are enabled to disempower others. 2. The liberal vision endorses the empowerment of individuals only to the extent that they are not enabled to disempower others.

In the libertarian vision, there is no democratic collective as individuals directly exercize their powers without regard for the well-being of others. Therefore, only the liberal version is truly democratic.

*Argument: Any argument against the will of the people erodes the foundations of democracy.*

On the contrary, doing what the people appear to want isn't necessarily democratic. For example, it may very well be that the people want to enact mob justice, but letting them have their way in lieu of due process is not democratic insofar as it disempowers the target of populist outrage. These populists are only one segment of the people, not ""the people"" as it excludes the target of their outrage.

Therefore, the foundations that lend legitimacy to democracy are themselves ""non-democratic"" in the populist sense. Democracy is not special this way. All positions are like this. Obeying a monarch who is trying to abolish the monarchy is not monarchical. A supporter of democracy who erodes these foundations in the name of democracy is twisting the language of democracy for personal gain.

*Argument: It does not follow from Social Choice Theory that ""the people"" includes every member of society. It is possible that, in a given case, almost every member of society is coherently outraged against some target. Mob justice is democratic in that case.*

Numbers are not everything when it comes to maintaining democratic institutions. For example, why are the people outraged? Is it possible that they are not in possession of all the facts? What if there's a systematic skewing of their knowledge by the education system? Even if the people are outraged now, this outrage is an accidental, not essential, quality. Therefore, justice, argument and democratic institutions take precedence over popular opinion.

*Argument: The people cannot be kept in check by so-called ""democratic"" institutions imposed on them from without. It is their pride that drives them to be free.*

This is a common Romantic view. I propose a move towards Classicism.

It is true that the people themselves decide to be free, but the act of being free implies installing a censor over their actions. There is no absolute, unqualified freedom. It is by outlawing actions that lead to servitude that the people themselves enact their decision to be free. If they revoke this censorship by asserting unqualified freedom, they thereby slide into tyranny.

What is the nature of this censor? It is a legal act that outlaws oppression. If the people have chosen to be truly free, this includes outlawing oppressive practices within their own cultural tradition. It is here that freedom conflicts with pride. Assuming all cultural traditions contain oppressive practices, it is impossible for a people to express unqualified pride in their culture and be free at the same time.

*Argument: Tradition is the source of strength. Undermining it weakens the people.*

Not necessarily. Insofar as innovation is a source of strength, and innovation is only possible in a free environment, this form of strength comes from not being yourself. Innovation is also very powerful in the long run.

*Argument: Some nations are naturally smart and free, while others are dumb and servile. The market will naturally sort things out.*

The evidence cited for this view is usually Japan. Bear in mind that Japan's wealth came mainly from its colonial adventures, America investing loads of cash in it after WWII to stymie the neighboring USSR, etc. The market has never been meritocratic, and IQ is not as important as STEM majors think. The coastal Chinese are said to have a higher IQ than the Japanese in the populist propaganda screeds, but it appears very probable that they will regress on women's emancipation with the retreat of Communism: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-ono\_TRx64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-ono_TRx64) The rhetorical tricks will probably be the same ones we've heard a million times in other contexts: foreigners are attacking our oh-so-precious way of life, a Chinese China is a strong China, etc. This is especially likely if the global market screws them over, as it probably will. Unfortunately, Japanese nationalism seems to be the only non-Western populist movement to have at least partially figured out that in the long run, strength comes from being unlike yourself.",0,1575806636,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e7szeb/populism_is_the_opposite_of_democracy/,philosophy,1

When I say that, I'm meaning that I ripped and altered bits and pieces from current philosophies that I am interested by and/or resonate with. My inspirations were Transcendentalism, Nihilism, Existentialism, Stoicism, Hedonism, Taoism, Buddhism and Solipsism. 

Tuomelaism - Life has no inherent meaning or purpose. The individual can only truly rely on themselves, as they are the only ones who can pave their own paths and are the only thing that is certain to be real within their own lives. Nothing is certain or set in stone, and everything is susceptible to change. Because of this, people should get familiar with discomfort, as comfort and pleasure are never guaranteed, however, still important to savor. One cannot hope to control anything or anyone other than themselves and how they react to outside forces. Going with the natural order, or flow, is the best way to deal with this fact.

I hope you enjoy the read,"5g shroom trip report: Both conceptually and visually I descended down a staircase(Or in terms more easy to visualize a constant spiral twisting into itself)At the bottom of this staircase, in words I can best use to describe my experience; I transcended all thought, emotion, definitions, boundaries. All material existence ceased to matter before my eyes. I tapped into the vibrations of the universe and was rejoiced to find that all matter living and non reverberates within the same echo. I was confronted with the unavoidable fact that at the center of all of our actions lies our fear of death. And from there i was able to perceive death as being a counterpoint to the same vibration all of the rest of the universe shares, not something to be feared but to be celebrated. As this is simply the exclamation point on a uniquely thrilling journey. a familiar steadfast truth in face of all of existence. Death is the single constant, the one truth to hang onto when questioning the validity of all of the things in this reality we humans have created for ourselves. As soon as i allowed myself to embrace death it was like a key turning in a lock. Suddenly I was free of all anxiety and trepidation about the future. Things like hunger, cold, burns, blinding physical pain, heartbreak, betrayal, incarceration. all seemed irrelevant when the consequences of these mundane occurrences became suddenly trivial. For truly, what is there to be afraid of when death ceases to be a concern? My intentions and my visuals suddenly became so much clearer. Visually it was as if I was looking through a prism or crystal at a fragmented reality. Untainted and unburdened by the fears and anxieties of normal life I began to look at my life through new eyes. I saw those I hold dear in my life to be people Im attaching myself too because they bring genuine joy into my existence. I surround myself with them Not because of any underlying worries and social anxiety that create the feeling of obligation towards others. But because of honest love and affection towards them and an earnest desire for the betterment of their existence at the price of my own. For losing my own existence became something I no longer feared but accepted. I tapped into the ability to see an objective truth of the world, while still maintaining my subjective self. The bell of the world pealed in one joyous ring of harmony and understanding.  However around the peak I must admit I was concerned with the disconnected grasp on reality I was at the time experiencing. And the pragmatism of actually being able to sustain this type of headspace became clear. Although as Im typing this recant of my journey while im coming down, my soul feels clean and renewed. A sense of understanding of my place in the world, and peace with unburdening myself with the external hardships happening to me. I understand how small and insignificant i am in the universe, and that thought makes me feel free and connected to life around me in ways i cannot due justice to describe with any amount of words.

You will have a choice on whether or not you will rip each page of the calendar yourself every single day that passes until you die. It won’t change anything about your life for whatever you want to do. You will always live life to the fullest.

You wouldnt know this quickly though, because there are so many different schools of thought on here about it. There is already the freudian and eastern definitions, which makes it even more confusing. I just wanna ask around to figure out what it is and satiate my curiosity anxiety. But that doesnt do much. I apparently need to read 40 books. Any other religious or philosophical idea can be explained in a few sentences without nuance.

e75bi0,thedirtymug,post-materialism does not exist (long),"My college professors have been recently attempting to show us students that we (GEN Z, and yes, telling us what *we* believe as a generation as a whole) no longer live in a materialist society. If this was the case there would not be people buying designer clothing. There would not be BMW, Mercedes, and Maserati vehicles on the road. There would not be people going into debt investing in these things just to have them. It logically makes no sense to pay out the ass for something that you could get at a substantially lesser price with more basic concepts. If we were truly a post-materialistic society, we would be living a basic life with intent on making other people's lives better. I truly believe that my generation having been born in a first world country \[not including immigrants who didn't have the benefits of growing up here\], has become even more materialistic. Hear me out. How many times do we see people on Instagram with luxuries ""flexing"" for the gram? All to often. How many times do we see people lining up for the new iPhone, the new Supreme merch, or the brand new Mercedes S-class? #airpods have 1,500,000 shares on instagram. #bmw has, take a guess........   43,000,000 shares. 

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to believe my professors that are pushing this narrative that we are becoming more human-like and caring for others. I believe that social media has become so perverted in the sense that our minds are constantly consumed with our followers, our likes, how good the lighting is (there are literally captions of people taking selfies saying ""sorry for the bad lighting"" or ""had to take a selfie the lighting was so good"" on instagram). We care so much about others' perception and validation of us that we forget to care about our own perception of us. Then we see these pictures of BMWs and Lamborghinis and vacations in Bali and get resentful of these people and our brain immediately goes ""what can I buy that will make me look somewhat alike to this person's financial capability in order to validate myself and forget that I am a broke, weak, hopeless being"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I believe that it is actually, hypothetically, quite easy to get rich. But the consumers of today's society need a massive, and I mean absolutely, devastatingly huge paradigm switch. Capitalism is the easiest economic structure to get rich, for heavens sake - and all I see are people complaining about their 9-5 and how they hate Mondays. Yes, you must work to survive as a consumer - I understand that. What I don't understand however is how we can literally, reasonably calculate our lifelong earnings if we work wage labour at the same job for 35-50 years (not including promotions) and not want to take action to change our lives to acquire more wealth. If we simply stop thinking about the next guy and what he has that our insecure, self-pity feeling ass doesn't but *wants* so that we can feel *validated,* we can think logically about acquiring wealth and put our entire god-damn selves into doing so. Everyone wants to get rich. It's a perverted distortion of the meaning of life that capitalism has completely warped us into believing. But the desire to want to get rich is different than desiring to desire to put the work and time in to gain this wealth. We know this, but nothing will change. Wealth will only some to the people that actually apply this wholeheartedly and don't make excuses. The powers of the human mind are being suppressed by consumerism and I'm laughing. The rich must be laughing. No wonder they think we're stupid, because they don't have a consumerist mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't mean to confuse you, I am not a rich, wealthy one percenter. I'm merely a broke college student judging the world around me because I see it for what it is, at least in my own, bias, naive opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this stirs some discussion and that people can offer me insight on why I'm absolutely wrong or those who have additional information to support my **multiple** claims, lol.

[UnDaoDu journey to enlightenment. \\""Summer Wind\\""](https://preview.redd.it/gmbopm4sky241.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb0748800c84e7cb9b5d9ea9755033664777c666)

  
One's journey to self-actualizing and enlightenment starts at its foundation with a simple question... 

**""Why do I exist?""** This is the ""Un"" stage if life... Un\_derstanding, Un\_ravelling, Un\_doing your preconceptions. At this stage, one becomes a ""Pre\_Dao"" One is one the path to self-actualization. There are many paths one can take, just as there are many blockchains one can choose to transform the world on. These are represented in the gems.  Finally, ""Du"" happens. Like waking up to the Truth one becomes enlightenment. Or in Duism one calls a sahdu. Enlightenment is something one achieves.  It is not a journey but rather an acceptance of who you truly are. 

""All there is... is entangled data."" UnDaoDu 

One could say there are 5 States of ""stuff"" -- Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma and ""Du""  

**What is the state of Du?**

We all know that on the quantum scale observation impacts the outcome. We also know entanglement and superpositioning is a thing. We know based on math that dark matter and dark energy, gravitons and even space/time are all real.  Yet science struggles to verify their existence.  This is my hypothesis Entanglement is not something unique in a few things where it is detected but rather in everything. And why is that? The Du is a superposition a kind of ""proto juice"" that exists in the near singularity state. This is the fabric of the multiverse/parallel universes. Dark matter/energy and gravitons exist in a constant superpositioned state existing all at once in all our dimensions and multiverse, in a way kind of holding it all together.  What if then, the profound connection some feel with the Universe is merely an awareness of the Du. The coloring of it is what led us to religion. Which is merely a profound desire to communicate the Du with others without the vocabulary to do it. 

* **Atheist** \- ""Stop fucking coloring the Du! It's just data!""
* **Theists** \- ""Du is anthropomorphic God/Allah!
* **Buddhist -** ""We flow into and out of the Du until enlightenment makes one with the Du.""
* **Daoist -** ""To talk about the Du destroys it.""
* **Cultist** \- ""Du is magic"" 

The core precept of Duism is to encourage folks to have fun coloring the Du, Just do not impose your coloring on others. Everyone has the right to color the Du as long as the coloring does not harm others.  

Duism is not a religion but a kind of philosophy or more exactly a metaphysics that seeks to provide us, using quantum mechanics, a unifying theory that explains atheism and why there are so many religions. Created in the heartland of Zen Buddhism near Eiheiji by UnDaoDu. In 2004 on arriving to Japan he sought to answer two questions for his own personal benefit and peace of mind. 

* Why are their so many religions, including atheism that each argues they alone are correct and the other wrong?
* Does there exist a unifying theory for explaining them that can be based on science?",0,1575617640,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e6vikd/introduction_to_duism_metaphysics_of_everything/,philosophy,1

e6u9f5,accidentle,Your favorite memory is probably your most false memory...,"They say that every time you recall a memory you change it just a little bit. So eventually, depending on how many times you recall that memory, it has changed completely from what it was. 

Ever remember something for the first time? Like in therapy? The intensity that memory holds is in the fact that it is unchanged. Any time you recall that memory after that first remembering it is false. 

[It eventually becomes the version of itself that helps you heal. Helps you deal.]

If we remember everything exactly how it was life would be unbearable and unlivable. Memory is creative. It has to be. It has to do with perception. Everyone has a different perception of reality. Therefore a different perception of memory. And also each individual has a different and ever changing perception of their own memory. It changes as you grow and look back and take whatever lesson you need from the memory. The memory is there to serve you. And it will take whatever form it needs to help you grow.

e6sw0f,Ewoud15,Philosophy lecture Hannah Arendt,"Hi everyone,

I am 18 years old and in my last year of high school (The Netherlands). Because I am going to study philosophy and want to become a teacher, I have been given the oppurtunity to give a lecture in Hannah Arendt to a class of 15/16 year old kids. I am still looking for a good way to connect her theory with their lives. I need to explain the following terms in 50 minutes:
The banality of evil
Labour
Work
Action

If you have any ideas or suggestions, I would love to hear them!",0,1575602929,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e6sw0f/philosophy_lecture_hannah_arendt/,philosophy,1

e6qkvc,superbigguy420,Wittgenstein &amp; Hegel,"Today I wrote a final essay for a class that was completely centered around Wittgenstein. I am also in a modern philosophy class and have been studying Hegel alongside Wittgenstein this semester. I began to notice similarities between Wittgenstein’s language/language games and how they function together, and Hegel’s triadic process, often called his “dialectic”. The understanding of this method being understanding, negation, and then a return to the original understanding with the nuance of the negation.

In terms of Wittgenstein’s views on language the method would be applied as follows. 

1. FIRST MOVEMENT — Having an experience or idea that is to be communicated between individuals, non-verbal feeling

2. SECOND MOVEMENT — Words NEGATE the feeling or experience insofar as they are merely symbols that contain no meaning. The feeling is chopped up into words that attempt to convey what is to be shared

3. THIRD MOVEMENT — The words are unpacked by the receiving individual. They recreate the original feeling or experience as best as they can from the description provided. The key to this stage is maintaining a understanding that while words can serve to explain feelings or experiences they are only as good as they are used so there is guaranteed discrepancy. 

This is a little over simplified as both systems take sometime to grasp, but if you are familiar with these two philosophers let me know what ya think!",0,1575592381,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/e6qkvc/wittgenstein_hegel/,philosophy,1
